Colors Used in the Apparel Industry The fashion market is made up of many comparatively small manufacturers . Each is engaged in the task of producing goods and selling them at a profit . If a woolen mill believes that gray will sell in women 's coats , it will present gray in its sample line . The first response from the better coat manufacturers and the first buyers who review the line determines whether or not the mill continues or withdraws the color .

Red ? brilliant yellow-red ? made its appearance in the accessory market in 1938 and was very successful , being featured by the manufacturers of inexpensive shoes and bags . The response was so gratifying that the all-red evening gown in chiffon , net , or velvet , and the short red jigger box coat , were soon available at all stores in comparatively low price ranges . Furs , in their natural state , are predominantly brown , but research has developed methods of bleaching and dyeing them in more flattering colors . Skunk is available in sable-dyed colors .

American consumers demand color fastness.  | This is one reason that imported fabrics , as scarves , prints , handkerchiefs , and novelty leather goods look so beautiful . The colors are skillfully blended but are generally not washable . We have not always demanded the same standards of durability from importers as we have from our domestic producers . A summary of the leading basic colors used in various industries follows . Naturally , research findings , new processes , and new products change from year to year . In 1941 , there was a trend toward the development of a larger volume of synthetic fabrics such as rayon , nylon , glass , and vinolyte . Doubtless , development in this direction will continue because of the shortage of silk , linen , and wool . Plastics furnish novelty colors unheard-of in natural substances . Water-repellent finishes enabled manufacturers to produce white cotton raincoats . The activities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1941 and 1942 , covert , fleece , and wool crepes were available in khaki color , and Air-Force blue was a best-selling color . Black It is a notable fact that black occurs seldom in nature . There are no black flowers or woods , and few black stones or minerals . Coal and jet are among the few natural black products . Black panthers and black cats and dogs are comparatively rare . Even the blackbird has a touch of red beneath his wings . The all-black costume is funereal and denotes mourning . It is dignified and formal , but because it drains the color from the face it makes the person who wears it appear older . Because it drains the color from the face , however , black may be successfully worn by the sun-tanned individual . Economy is one of the best selling points for black . Black merchandise may be obtained in a wider selection at the same price than may merchandise in most other colors . Dull black costumes , properly cut and fitted , reduce the apparent size of the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large woman . For evening wear it has been discovered , however , that midnight blue looks blacker than black under electric lights ; and so today most manufacturers of men 's formal and semi-formal evening suits use midnight blue . The man who insists on a'true black must make a special order or have his suit custom-made . Black is not so subject to the whims of  | fashion change as are other colors . It may be worn in many articles throughout the year . Black is almost a staple color for women 's street coats . More than 60 per cent of the coats sold yearly for fall and winter wear are black . Black crepe is an ideal fabric for dresses for both daytime and evening wear . The dignity associated with black makes it a suitable choice for academic robes . Black looks best in fur , woolens , silks , felt , and leather . Because the cost of dyeing is out of proportion to the cost of the cotton fabric used , black cotton and linen are seen only occasionally . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty cents a yard , and that of dyeing light blue , at four cents a yard . Colors may be used to off-set the objection to black that it drains the color from the face . Black makes the skin appear clearer and paler . Warm colors , such as reds , gold , pink , warm beige , tan , and certain middle shades of purple combine well with black ; but dark shades , such as navy , charcoal brown , dark green , and maroon are not especially pleasing with it . White used in large amount with black gives a dignified and sophisticated appearance , as is true of a man 's tail coat worn with a white shirt , vest , and tie . A small lace collar on a black dress achieves a youthful , demure effect . Light brown furs , such as beaver , kolinsky , and marten , look better with black than do the darker furs . Beige and gray are effective if the costume is relieved with a warm color or if the wearer has high natural coloring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman or girl who must economize . A black dress or suit of satisfactory fabric and construction will give many years of wear . It is a simple task to find bright supplementary accessories for such a dress . The black chiffon , lace , crepe , or velvet evening or dinner gown is successful for most women . Transparent black is especially effective for girls and young women . The titian-haired woman and the blue-eyed blonde or brunette look especially well in black for evening wear . The color is seldom available for sportswear except in riding boots , hats , and jackets . The black wool bathing suit has been replaced by other colors . A black hat , gloves , and shoes look well for summer wear with colored prints or with a touch of another color . Only a small amount of another color is necessary to relieve black :  | a red chiffon scarf , bright blue buttons and a bright blue veil , feathers or flowers on the hat , a coral corsage , or a bright green ring with a green hat . Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used in an accessory . Yellow-red instead of blue-red lipstick and rouge likewise relieve the somber aspect of black . Unless relieved with a large expanse of a color , however , black is depressing in interiors . A black marble foyer at a certain bank was so austere and forbidding that clients preferred the less elegant but cheerful side entrance . White White is the epitome of purity , freshness , and youthfulness . It is the traditional choice for formal ceremonies ; for christening robes , wedding gowns , confirmation and graduation dresses , and lodge ceremonies . It symbolizes professional attainment ; therefore , since novices are required to wear colors , nurses take great pride in their white uniforms and caps . Because white wash goods improves in appearance with laundering , white linens and white cottons are staples . White bed linens , table linens , and towels have always been used , and in recent years decorators have utilized the clean , cool white duck for furniture covers . With a bright cording , this sturdy yet inexpensive fabric assumes a definite note of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item for men 's shirts . Dyestuff manufacturers report in 1941 , however , that colors surpassed white in volume . White shoes , or white shoes with a contrasting color , and white straw hats , have become so securely entrenched in the market that off-white or natural color does not sell well in spring and summer apparel . White looks dirty when combined with a pale pastel or an offwhite such as natural or oyster color . This effect of one white on another may be observed if a white linen handkerchief is placed on a white porcelain washstand . Although both materials are white , the porcelain looks dirty because the handkerchief is a " whiter " white . Rayon fabric retains its sparkling whiteness even after many washings ; therefore these fabrics are ideal for summer wear . Popular for resort , cruise , southern , and summer wear , white is also ideal for evening wear . Men use it effectively in the " white tie " and tail coat with white vest and shirt . The white evening gown is flattering for women of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should be avoided by the large woman or girl except for occasions when the gowns worn by all of the women present are white . For such occasions soft , white , semi-transparent silk or rayon is the best choice . For general business wear , the all-white costume is impractical . White accessories that can be readily washed or cleaned are satisfactory . Off-white or natural has been introduced for winter sportswear . The white feather or fabric hat is a pleasing accompaniment for an all-black winter coat for afternoon or evening wear . White combines better with vivid or pronounced colors than with pastels or achromatic colors . Dresses with an accent of other colors outsell those in all white . White is safe with black , navy blue , bright red , dark reddish-brown , purple , and Kelly green . The effect of white with gray , beige , or taupe is too somber except in highstyle merchandise . White evening jackets look well with all colors including grays , pinks , and other pastels . Persons of all complexions wear white to advantage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slipper satin wedding dresses are sold in off-white rather than in a clear paper-white . Blondes look well in white unless natural coloring is lacking . The titian-haired person may avoid as too theatrical or striking the all-white street costume , but may select it for evening or sportswear . The standard costume for tennis is the white dress with white undergarments ? shoes , and socks . A white eyeshade may have a colored brim . Gray-haired women look most attractive in white . Blue At the time of the first World War , American woolen mills had been manufacturing navy-blue serge exclusively for eighty years . Navy-blue serge had long been the standard accepted for daytime suits , and gray or white flannel for slacks . Middy blouses , collared in blue serge and worn with navy-blue serge bloomers or pleated skirts , made up the " uniform " of the American high-school girl . After the first World War the brighter colors of the European soldiers ' uniforms awakened American doughboys to the effectiveness of other colors . Today , midnight blue is replacing black for men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black tinder artificial light and is more becoming than black . Dark blue  | is a wool , silk , and rayon color ; it is seldom found in linens and cottons , although when it is , dark-blue linens and cottons are very attractive . Limited to spring and summer wear for a long time , blues , including both navy and brighter blues , have come to be accepted for general wear the year-round . Dark blue combines well with all other colors except browns and blacks . It looks well with pastels , bright red , green , gold , and fuchsia , and is excellent with the achromatic colors ? white , gray , and beige . Dark blue , therefore , is an ideal basic wardrobe choice for all persons except the brown-eyed , red-haired person . A man 's best choice of costume is navy blue with a white shirt and with a tie containing some red ? bright red if he is a dark brunette , brownish red if he is red-haired , and dark red if his hair and skin coloring are light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkblue accessories do not look well with black . For several reasons navy blue is the most generally flattering color for persons of all ages , colorings , and sizes . Because it is the nearest complement to the skin tone , it makes the skin appear clear , but does not drain the color from the face as does black . For the grayhaired person or the blonde , navy is a splendid contrast . The redhaired person who can not wear a lighter blue wears navy fairly well ; but browns and beige are more effective for the brown-eyed titianhaired person . Navy blue is neither too somber for older persons nor too sophisticated for children . It is a splendid daytime color , and when obtainable for evening dresses it is most flattering . Navyblue lace , taffeta , satin , brocade , velvet , net , or chiffon are all equally becoming . The large person appears smaller in a navy-blue costume ; yet it is also a good choice for the junior miss . Soft blues of middle value , similar to French blue or R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Youthful , " pretty " colors in this range were found , until recently only in clear cottons . Blue chambray from the men 's shirt department has been appropriated for women 's and misses ' dresses . A few years ago , when the spotlight of world interest fell on the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci , both French and American manufacturers saw the possibilities of using the magnificent " Madonna " blues for the apparel market . Chiffon or velvet evening dresses in these colors are especially feminine . Once confined to children 's coats , these beautiful blues are today available in both formal and  | casual coats and dresses . Furs in the middle range of browns , as well as the darker furs , look well with this family of colors . Darker blue accessory colors are generally more satisfactory for winter wear than are pastels . White and black are both excellent when combined with blue . For many years blues were considered to be colors reserved for blondes . While it is true that the blue-eyed blonde looks most attractive in this color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pale sky-blue , it has been found that blues are equally attractive for the brunette . The blue-eyed woman with dark brown or black hair looks very well in this color . A hat faced with medium blue , or a soft blue felt or fabric hat , is delightful for the blue-eyed person . Children with unattractive face and body lines are transformed by the use of a blue that emphasizes the blue of the eyes and minimizes the bad effect of the awkward-appearing lines . Bright blue is effective in woolens and as an accent color in ties and printed fabrics . Brilliant , " show-card " blue is overpowering for the pale blonde or grayed-haired person unless it is used in small amounts or in a transparent fabric . This color , which makes the eyes appear gray , is too intense for the blue-eyed person . Blue-green Blue-green , like navy blue and the grayed blues of middle value , is a generally becoming color . Just as " Shocking Pink " and " da Vinci " blue were featured first in the fashion market before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-green , neglected for many years , was featured . Turquoise , teal , and blue spruce are a few of the names given to this combination of blue and green which produces a color neither definitely blue nor green . Different lights bring out or emphasize one color or the other . Lucien Lelong was the couturier who first promoted blue-green with marked success . One season this designer featured motifs and colors from the sea . Shells , scallops , sea horses , wave prints , and all kinds of blue-green prints and woven motifs were included in that collection . The success of the color has continued . Not always obtainable in all kinds of fabric , this color is most effective in coatings , dress woolens , velvet and felt , and in sweaters and sportswear . It is not used in leather or fur . Being somewhat neutral and grayed , bluegreen looks better with other intermediate colors than with the  | achromatic colors , white , black , or gray . Beige , coral , dark red , dark blue , and purple are excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blush , and lavender also combine well with it . All fur colors , as well as the brown leather colors , look well with blue-green . Artists combine blues with greens beautifully , but it is difficult for the consumer successfully to combine blues with greens in accessories . Red Brilliant red is a gay , youthful , advancing color . It denotes warmth and livens up the wardrobe as well as the person wearing it . Red-haired persons who know that they should avoid wearing brilliant red ask if there is not something that they can do to satisfy their craving for this color . Such a person may wear red at home in smoking jackets , night gowns , smocks , pajamas , or for sportswear . One famous tailor recommends bright-red shorts and undershirts to many of his middle-aged customers from the banking circle . The employers of a red-haired cook appreciated her ability so much that they had the kitchen ceiling painted red and used red linoleum on all of the working surfaces . The cook , as well as her employers , is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and woolens . Red leather accessories are very attractive . Some shade of red can be worn by persons of all complexions except the red-haired person . As red makes a person appear larger , it is not the best choice for the large person . The short red coat , suitable for wear over many types of costumes of many other colors , has recently come into prominence . Red hats are delightful for blondes and gray-haired women . Brilliant red is tiresome for the every-day business dress or coat ; but dark or wine red is an excellent choice . Gray Gray is a combination of black and white . Blue or red may he added to this combination , thus producing blue-gray or brownishgray . As in the case of blue and brown , there are many variations of gray . Brownish-gray is called taupe . When an obvious mixture of black and white is used , the combination is called oxford ; when black predominates , the color is called black oxford ; and when white predominates , it is called gray oxford . Men's-wear flannel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unbleached fabric is called natural . The most attractive grays are yarn-dyed for tweeds and men's-wear woolens . Gray fur , squirrel , and kidskin are popular . A solid-color gray is seldom outstanding from the point of view of sales in the cotton and linen market , although gray linen and cotton dress fabrics are very attractive . Gray shoes and bags are not always obtainable . Gray hats are more commonly used . Although an achromatic color suggesting age , gray is a most wearable and satisfactory color if properly used . Captain Edward Molyneux , the English-born Parisian couturier , featured gray in his collections of women 's fashions in a gray salon that attracted much interest before the recent war . In the men's-wear department some variation is acceptable for every man regardless of hair or eye coloring or size . Color in the tie , shirt , and handkerchief lightens the somber effect . The white or gray-haired person with blue or gray eyes and a normal complexion can wear gray most effectively . It is also a good choice for the person having vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The large person tiring of or disliking black or navy blue , frequently finds dark gray a good substitute . The pale or colorless individual , however , needs a more positive contrast and might better wear navy blue or dark brown . Gray silk or rayon fabric is flattering for evening wear for all complexions . Light gray , however , increases apparent size and should be avoided by the very large . The person recovering from a long illness is depressed by this color . Persons having high natural color and brilliant yellow-blonde , brunette , black , or red hair , sometimes wish to offset this striking effect . Gray subdues too much or too intense natural color , and is an excellent choice for a person of this type . A very beautiful woman or an extremely handsome man wears gray as a background for the natural coloring because the effect of wearing vivid colors would be too striking . The red-faced person or the individual who blushes easily , or frequently , also will find comfort in gray . Since this color may be varied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gray of medium value is not confined to one season , and it may be used for either formal town daytime costumes or for casual or sportswear . Gray combines well with warm colors such as red , pink , coral , fuchsia , and gold , and is pleasing with certain bright greens and  | blues . It looks more attractive with the positive spectrum than with the achromatic colors . Beige or taupe with gray presents a dull and somber combination . Intermediate colors brighten gray and relieve its somber character . A bright green dress worn with a gray coat is both youthful looking and harmonious . Other bright colors worn with gray are equally effective . Pink . Pink , which is a tint of red , is most frequently encountered in the underwear and corset industries and in women 's and misses ' evening dresses and sweaters . As this color requires only a small amount of dyestuff , even a slight difference is noticeable under a strong light . For over a decade the color pink , a straight tint of red without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underwear industry by nude or flesh colorings which are tints of yellow-red . Pink is not a flattering color for daytime wear except for persons having a clear complexion or for pale blondes and gray-haired women . Dusty pink , however , being a color of middle value with some gray in it , is more flattering for general daytime wear . Silks , cottons , linens , and rayons look very well in these ranges of colors . Pink is seldom found in leathers or furs . It is being used in the men's-wear industry in ties and shirtings , however . Pink and other colors of this family combine well with black , navy , medium blue , wine-red , gray , middle-value and shades of green , dark brown , and purple . Beige is not a good color to use with pink as the two colors are too near to each other in value . For the same reason , warm reddish browns are sometimes discordant with pink . In addition to the dusty or smoky pink , flesh , nude , peach , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent materials . Thus , a flesh-colored collar becomes a sallowskinned brunette ; a gray-haired woman wears ? a pink hat with distinction . Persons of composite coloring look well in this color . It is less striking than white . Brown Browns make up one of the most important color ranges in the men's-wear industry . With the exception of fur , however , it is not used to any great extent in women 's wear , perhaps because brown street coats for town wear have not been fashionable for many years .  | Polo coats of camel 's hair for sports wear have always been popular . Browns are particularly pleasing in leather , silk , rayon , wool , and fur . They are attractive in cotton and linen , but are not always available in these fabrics . The natural furs , as sable , mink , marten , fitch , and beaver , are all of subtle colors combining dark with light . They are flattering to all skin tones because they are blended and produce a soft effect . For this reason , inexpensive pelts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently dyed to imitate the more expensive natural furs . Sports clothes are especially attractive in browns . Brown golf shoes and riding boots , brown- and white-saddle oxfords , brown- andwhite spectator sports shoes for summer sportswear , bear witness to the popularity of this color range . Persons with titian hair and vivid blondes generally look very well in the varieties of brown . The gray-haired woman with brown eyes who has a clear complexion also looks well in brown . Brunettes and persons of composite coloring , however , must avoid wearing browns that intensify the brownish or sallow cast of their complexions . White and certain bright colors which offset this sallow tendency should be preferred by such persons . Orange-red rather than bluish - red lipstick and rouge should be worn with brown . Small amounts of bright green , brilliant blue , gold , coral , or orange , brighten soft browns for the brunette . White and brown is a sophisticated combination . Black and brown ? a combination of brown fur with black fabric ? is used for winter street coats . In solid-color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular . Tan , copper penny , red cent , and other middlevalue browns are popular for accessories . Tan and beige This range varies from camel 's hair color to pale and natural beige and is a flattering color for most skin tones and hair colorings . It has been out of the market for street wear , however , for several years . Beige and gray look better in yarn-dyed than in piece-dyed fabrics . The gamut of beige colors can be best seen in the hosiery field . For many years hosiery was white or black . Gun metal was the next outstandingly popular color . Nude or flesh-colored stockings have been popular for nearly two decades . After World War I , Gabrielle Chanel , the Parisian couturiere ,  | used beige jersey in a dress that became almost a national uniform . The present popularity for beige , however , is credited to Molyneux . Under certain lights , a good beige has a pinkish cast and a lavender sheen with a pale coppery quality to the color . Beige is especially beautiful in fur such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good color also in woolens , tweeds , and worsteds and in rayon and silk dress goods . Beige and gray are not outstanding in the wash-goods industry , however , perhaps because women prefer white and primary colors for summer wear . Most beige does not combine pleasingly with white . For this reason , natural and light tan colors in millinery , shoes , and handbags have not been successful for summer wear when white predominates in the apparel market . Beige is generally flattering for persons of all complexions : brunettes , blondes , gray-haired and titian-haired persons . The person with a delicate and washed-out coloring needs a contrasting color . For instance , if a pale blond man wears a Palm Beach color suit and a light tan shirt , he needs to wear a dark green , red , or blue tie and handkerchief to offset the lack of color . Beige combines well with many other colors , and especially well with dark colors . It is always effective with black , brown , dark red , purple , and dark green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pale green , are too near beige in value to combine well without the addition of another and more intense color . The secondary colors ? green , purple , and orange Intense or full-value green , purple , and orange are seldom used in apparel except as accent colors . Grayed or subdued hues based on these colors have proved more satisfactory . Chartreuse , olive green , ( lark green , jade , and Nile green are more flattering than a toointense green . A reflection of the complementary color in the face is noted when certain intense shades of green and purple are worn . Thus , the wearing of such a green causes the red-faced person to appear even more flushed , while the wearing of such a purple causes a reflection of yellow to appear in the face of the wearer . These effects are not pleasing . Tints of orange and variations of orange and yellow are found in the flesh , blush , and peach colorings used in the underwear industry . Green . Half a century ago printed green wallpaper was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child who had eaten some of the wallpaper caused all green to fall into disfavor . Green , also , has long symbolized jealousy , and its association with bad luck has long persisted . In spite of this negative feeling about the color , it is cool-looking and one of nature 's most abundant colors . It was in 1930 that the fabric manufacturers really began to explore the possibilities of green as a becoming color . For many years rust and green had been sales leaders in the home furnishings market . Rugs , draperies , and upholstery in these colors were used in at least one room in nearly every home . In 1941 the Textile Color Card of the National Retail Dry Goods Association listed seven greens for fall wear . These colors were all flattering . Moss green and a darker neutral green were suggested for dressy and casual wear and clear , bright , and pleasing green for sports . Three other versions , slate green , wood green , and Brigand green , were mentioned for costume suits and wool dresses . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rayon dresses . In 1940 the Fashion Group , an organization of professional women working in the fashion and related industries , had featured green in a fashion show of American-designed clothes . Since more flattering rouge and lipstick colors are available , women are learning that green may be obtained in many becoming variations . Green combines well with warm colors as pink , dark red , and coral . Black accessories may accompany a dark-green ensemble if the green is not too dull . Browns , beige , and grays combine well with greens . Artists use blue and green together effectively , but seldom is it possible to obtain a range of blues and greens in merchandise that look well together . Green and white is a cool combination . Green sweaters and other sportswear look well with the browns and other neutral tweed colors . Leather and fur are seldom dyed green , although green alligator and lizard bags and shoes are attractive . For an accent , green combines well with neutral colors . Purple . As a color worn in mourning , purple was considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was associated with age , and " lavender and old lace " were reserved for grandmothers . Fashion designers featured variations in violet , grape , plum , and the beautiful and becoming aubergine , which is the French word for eggplant . Fuchsia , a color derived from the flower of that name , became popular with debutantes as an accessory or costume color .  | Cosmetic manufacturers , quickly realizing that orange-red rouge looked badly with purplish clothes , devised blue-red cosmetic colors in rouge , lipstick , and fingernail polish . As a result , many subdued and flattering colors are obtainable in this family , and it is no longer considered an " old lady 's " color . Fur and leather are seldom dyed in this gamut , but cotton , silk , linen , rayon , wools , and felt are all attractive in some variations of it . Blue and black are not especially pleasing in combination with purple . Combining well with browns , grays , or subdued warm shades or tints ? as lilac with maroon , or pink with violet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear and for sports , casual , or dressy clothes . In transparent fabrics such as nets , chiffon , and lace , and in taffeta and velvet , the color is most becoming for evening wear . Blondes wear purple well as it is the complement to the color of their hair ; but they should select it in a subdued rather than an intense version . Clear-skinned brunettes and persons of composite coloring , as well as gray-haired , blue-eyed persons , wear purples with distinction . The titian-haired person , however , should avoid purple . Its use introduces too many strong colors , and the combination is , therefore , not pleasing . Orange and yellow . Suggesting sunlight and warmth , these colors are most effective in interiors . To a north room , orange or yellow brings the effect of sunlight and cheer . In apparel , however , they are best used in subdued tints , as found in the underwear industry , in sweaters and cottons , or in occasional evening wear . Yellow linen for summer is flattering , but is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for children and infants . It is seldom used for coats or suits ? except in the summer . Yellow furs , with the exception of leopard , are often dyed darker colors . Since browns are in the same family , they always combine well with orange and yellow . Black and bright blues used with orange and yellow produce somewhat of a poster effect . White , however , makes a good companion . Beige and taupes are not best with yellow or orange as they are too similar . The blonde wears yellow nicely unless the hair lacks natural coloring . There is something about the combination of gray hair and yellow that is very pleasing . Red-haired persons wear yellow well for accent . This color is not the best choice for the average brunette.  | How to Make Displeasing Colors Harmonious The person who has on hand an array of clothes that have not lost their fashion rightness or wearability and yet are found to be unsatisfactory from the color standpoint may achieve wardrobe harmony by having certain articles redyed . Soap tints are available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwear . The progressive dry cleaner because of study in redyeing is able to recondition with surprising success coats , suits , and dresses even when these are made of wool . The shrinkage of the dyed product depends on the kind and amount of preshrinking given the fabric when it was finished by the manufacturer . Many dry cleaners accept regular business on evening slippers , men 's suits and topcoats , and women 's outer garments . The redyeing of outer garments by the consumer is not recommended . Large containers are required for this work , and the inexperienced dyer is likely to ruin the garment by streaking it . Then , too , certain stains require removal by an expert . Light colors may all be successfully redyed dark blue , black , green , brown , and many shades of red . While it is possible to strip or remove the color before retinting , this practice is not recommended because it weakens the fabric . While the dyer can not guarantee success , his suggestions should be considered . A study of the color harmonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal a basic contrast color to harmonize with those on hand . Sports clothes in tweed , checks , plaids , or vivid stripes may be redyed for town wear . A print dress may be converted into a fairly wearable black dress by a skilled dyer . Other ways of dealing with displeasing colors include : using a flattering color near the face when wearing the unwanted color ; changing cosmetic colors ; and using harmonious accessories . For instance , beige , pale pink , nude , or natural worn near the face ' off set the harsh effect of a too-bright purple . A flattering colored scarf , necktie , or piece of jewelry is also effective . Cosmetic colors range from orange-reds to purple-reds and from light to dark . By experimenting with other colors , the best one to accompany the displeasing color may be discovered . Warm or vivid colors worn with gray , taupe , olive , and some browns offset the somber effect of these colors . A coral blouse , for example , looks well with a gray suit , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wardrobe Colors The color selected for the costume is determined by the choice of colors available in the market at the desired price rather than by individual preference . As manufacturers continue to develop the color ranges that sell best , certain colors are dropped and hence are no longer obtainable . Wine-red is a popular basic color that came into the market in the 1930 's . Soft blues are gradually being accepted for year-round wear . Purple and green are still only occasional colors , although they are increasing in volume . Because merchandise is always available in many price ranges , the best colors for the basic wardrobe include black , brown , beige , gray , navy and lighter blue , and wine-red . Brilliant red is pleasing for occasional wear , but is too bright for a basic wardrobe . Blue-greens are not always to be found in all price ranges . Color Selection in Relation to Size and Personality In considering colors for persons of different hair and eye coloring and complexions , the questions of size and personality are likely to be overlooked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay , light-hearted , and vivacious as the other , can not both wear yellow if one is size ten and weighs ninety-four pounds and the other size twenty and weighs one hundred and eighty pounds . Since light colors tend to increase apparent weight , they should be avoided by the too-stout person . A person of strong personality can wear brighter colors than can a shy , retiring individual . A person having beautiful and vivid natural coloring may wish to subdue or tone down this coloring to avoid a too-striking appearance . A beautiful girl who seeks employment in an office must remember that she is being employed for work and not as a model ; therefore she should wear black or other somber colors . Women of taste and discrimination who are beautiful do not always want the spotlight of attention . A concert singer , actress , or model , however , may emphasize a striking natural coloring to the utmost . In business and social life , well-bred women try to present a more reserved appearance . Colors Most Flattering for All Individuals Navy blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright red , blue-green , and gray are the most acceptable basic colors for daytime  | wear . White or natural and black are always appropriate for evening wear . Black is not always flattering for street wear because it makes the individual look older by draining color from the face . These facts are shown by a study of best-selling colors in dress and casual coat , suit , and dress fabrics made by the Botany Worsted Mills . During 1939 , 1940 , and 1941 their best-selling colors , it was found , included , in addition to black , wine-red , medium blue , dark green , raspberry , beige , light gray , crushed rose , and blonde . This company makes a complete range of goods covering both the volume and higher-priced manufacturers . Bright colors such as Royal blue , purple , and orange are difficult to wear because they do not look pleasing with skin tones . Dark red conveys more dignity and formality than bright yellow-red . It speaks of luxury and authority . The early Chinese porcelains are of this color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced a dark red .

But in reality , all salaried persons are day workers , earning by fulfilling prescribed services the wages to supply their needs . The prestige of an honored family name , the owning of real estate , stocks and bonds , and other evidences of wealth , are over a period of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluctuating values in real estate , mergers of large holding companies , depreciation ? all conspire to the disadvantage of the socalled wealthy . Therefore , our country is full , today , of salaried persons ? day workers , all directing their physical or intellectual efforts toward some end . Ideas , when developed in such a way as to be advantageous to the employer , and when properly presented , are the surest means of increasing earning capacity . Proper clothing , however , is a requisite as necessary to a worker 's success as his skill or technical training . Promotion of young workers is frequently withheld until the executives of the company are satisfied with their performance and accomplishment of jobs , their ability to get along with customers and co-workers , their conduct , and personal appearance . Judgment is constantly being made on personal appearance and dress . The Value of Correct Appearance What an improved personal appearance means to thousands of women and girls is shown in the amazing response to the home beauty courses which began to be given throughout America in 1936. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a six weeks ' course down to a few dollars for a series of printed instructions , have indicated the eagerness of American women to improve their appearance . Diets for weight building or reducing , exercises to improve carriage and poise , relaxing exercises , and specific analyses of hair , skin , and figure types , are generally included . Many amazing stories are told of the happiness that has come to women who , through these courses , have been able to enter new social and business worlds . Being fat , ugly , awkward , or shy is a severe handicap to many people until they realize that proper attention to posture , grooming , and selection of clothes will to a great extent overcome their defects . " What you look like determines in some measure what you are , " are words that should be repeated again and again to young people and to those who have not yet achieved professional success . These words express a concept that is ever-present in the minds of employers engaging workers . " Dress for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wise council . In the early days of America 's development , products were so scarce that customers built a road to the shops of all good craftsmen . Carpenters , shoemakers , tinsmiths , weavers , encountered no difficulty in selling the work of their minds and hands . Production was paramount . With the perfection of machine-produced goods , however , the emphasis changed from production to selling . Selling involves dealing with people , hence the necessity for what seems to be an undue regard for personal appearance . Apart from social success , a good personal appearance accomplishes two vital things : it builds self-confidence , and it aids in the discharge of one 's duties . It takes courage to ask for a job or a raise . It requires more than courage to direct or address fellow workers when the promotion has been gained . Fear is a weapon of destruction dissipated by confidence . Competence and belief in one 's own ability are the weapons of success . Being Well-Dressed Clothes worn by women famous for their beauty and fashionable appearance demonstrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most satisfactory wardrobes , regardless of cost , are those selected : first to be appropriate for the occasion ; second , For daytime wear simplicity is desirable .

Wise clothes counselors advise customers to consider the clothes already in their wardrobes before making new purchases . They know that few women will buy and wear a complete outfit very long . The new coat will soon be worn with last season 's dress , and the new hat with dresses other than the one for which it was selected . Most fabrics made in America wear a remarkably long time ; therefore clothes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wear out . To display wisdom in the selection of new clothes demands reasonable care of old clothes . A buyer of women 's and misses ' coats at a Fifth Avenue store says that she is astonished at the thoughtless way some women treat their coats . " As customers come in to buy their spring coats we have an opportunity to see their winter coats . It is surprising to see how new-looking some coats are and how tattered and old others look , even though both were purchased at the same time . " Reasonable care is required if clothes are to be kept clean , dry , in repair , properly aired , and adequately stored when out of season . A recent survey showed that many women ruin clothes in washing not because the fabric itself is not washable , but because the details of the garment ? collar , shoulder , sleeve ? are often pleated , shirred , or constructed in such a manner that the average woman is unable properly to restore the shape of the garment . Garments that are dry-cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many women , therefore , preserve the newness and crisp appearance of their cotton street and evening dresses by having them dry-cleaned . It is more economical to have an outer garment dry-cleaned than to run the risk of ruining it by washing . However , lingerie touches , as collars and cuffs , should be washed after each wearing , and duplicate sets should always be on hand for frequent change . Mending simple tears and holes and keeping clothes dry seem simple precautions . Many women complain about a lack of clothing when a few simple repairs would restore satisfactorily garments already in their wardrobes . Rips in seams or loose buttons should receive immediate attention . Cigarette holes and other tears may be mended by reweaving . " Invisible " mending is especially successful in suits , coats , and other woven woolen garments .  | Wet coats should not be sat upon .

Brilliant sunshine , however , is too strong for most fabric colors . For airing , clothes should be hung in the shade . Proper storage includes not only drawer space for underwear and accessories , but boxes for hats , and racks for shoes . Daytime Clothes The fabric , color , and fur of the winter coat indicates whether a costume is of a casual , dressy , or sports character . The coat is the most expensive item in the wardrobe of most women . Clothes for general sports or casual wear were developed in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , tweeds were made in weights and colors suitable only for country wear . Formal woolens were soft and luxurious in solid colors such as black , browns , dark reds , and greens , and were suitable only for town wear . The increased demand for sports clothes brought about the introduction of tweed-type fabrics for wear in town and less formal fabrics that look correct for wear in either town or country . Sable , Persian lamb , mink , broadtail , galyac , silver fox , and other luxury furs look best on dressier costumes for occasional wear . The furs suitable for sportswear include leopard , lynx , raccoon , muskrat , and skunk , while beaver and seal may be worn for either sports or casual wear . The casual costume is softly tailored and the fabric is suitable for wear in either town or country . Rich , luxurious fabrics should be worn together , as broadcloth and satin , Persian lamb and velvet , and duvetyn and silk crepe . Silver fox capes look best with plain solid-color dresses or coats . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a suit of Scottish plaid . A jeweled turban appears ludicrous with a plaid skirt . The Basic Wardrobe With the exception of clothes for active sports and evening wear , one costume with ' a top coat and removable lining , with proper accessories , can be made sufficient for the American woman for winter wear . An additional coat is desirable , but there are persons who manage with only one . Many women buy too many clothes without first assembling one complete costume . Customers of the  | highest-priced shops frequently wear one costume every day for several months . Many women in the fashion world buy only two costumes a year . These women are noted for being well dressed because every time they are seen they appear smart and correctly costumed . Minimum requirements begin with a good dress or suit and the accompanying coat . Lightweight silk , rayon , or wool fabric in a color suitable for wear the year round and construction adequate to insure long wear are the essential requirements for the dress . Good fabrics will not fade , shrink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediumweight rayon crepe will wear for two or even three years . Suits are most satisfactory when made of wool , as fabrics made from this fiber tailor better than do other fabrics . Satisfactory wool fabrics are today made with varying percentages of rayon or cotton . A mixed fabric of proper blend gives better service than a cheap or poorly made all-wool fabric . The proper construction will prevent the garment from losing its shape after daily wear and many cleanings . Colors suitable for year-round wear include black and medium shades of wine red , coppery brown , beige , gray , French blue , bluegreen , and soft leaf-green . Brilliant red is too bright for constant daytime wear . Navy blue is difficult to match with winter accessories . Pastels are satisfactory for wear in the South , but too light for winter wear in the North . The coat should be suitable for wear with or without the interlining , and the fabric should be waterrepellent for wear in the rain . Accessories Change the Character of the Basic- Costume Accessories such as shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of this one basic costume . It is wise to buy smoothleather street shoes with medium heels , a sturdy leather bag , and a fur-felt hat , so that this one set of accessories will last as long as the garment lasts . The chief objection to spending a limited amount of money on one costume instead of several less expensive ones is that wearing the same costume daily becomes monotonous . The use of bright colors , scarves , and jewelry relieves this monotony . A black suit , for instance , may be changed in many ways by the use of a variety of such accessories . For frequent wear , a suit without fur is most economical . The single-breasted suit is more ( Above ) Dresses for formal evening wear are generally more elaborate than dinner gowns .

With a white , washable tailored blouse in simple design , this suit provides a smart business costume . A simple felt hat with a medium brim , a black leather bag , black oxfords , and white washable gloves complete the costume . A black or white lightweight slip-over sweater provides a change . Worn with the jacket , this sweater is acceptable in most business offices . A change in color , as a coral blouse and gloves and a black turban , again alters the character of the suit . For dress-up occasions , a smarter blouse , or a tailored one with fancy buttons , or even a boutonniere of artificial flowers help to create a more festive effect . A colored veil transforms a plain black hat and is easily arranged . Inexpensive jewelry provides a color contrast .

They may also be transformed by scarves , small chiffon squares folded into triangles and tied around the throat , U-shaped or square collars made from handkerchiefs , bows of velvet or grosgrain ribbon at the corners of square collars , colored belts , or novelty buttons . Any of these items may be purchased for less than a dollar . Additions to the wardrobe should " fit in " or be harmonious with the basic costume .

Selection as to Personality One large and successful retail store considers five personality ypes : average , fashionable or sophisticated , pretty , the country resident , and the college girl .

She is not concerned with high fashion or with extreme or new fashions . She is conserv2tive and does not insist on exclusive colors or styles . The fashionable woman , on the other hand , seeks newness in color , design , and fabric . Because she likes extreme costumes and does not consider becomingness the first essential , she does not insist on durability or staple colors . The country dweller needs tweeds , sweaters , and brogues for walking . The college girl desires color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the selection of clothing is the choosing of clothes that do not go with the personality . Fashionable and extreme clothes , for example , are designed for slender women . Often a woman who has looked very well in new and fashionable costumes becomes heavier without realizing it and continues to wear this type of clothing . But the extra ten or fifteen pounds has increased her waist- and hipline and she no longer looks chic and smart . A fat woman sometimes looks absurd in extreme  | coat , suit , or dress fashions or colors . Likewise the pretty girl who looks well in fluffy curls , frills , ruffles , and pastel colors when she is twenty does not look equally well in such clothing if she gains weight and loses her clear complexion . Slender women with irregular features may wear extreme or fashionable costumes . Fat or heavy-set women should wear the average costume and should pay special attention to color and accessories . College girls are a law unto themselves when it comes to the selection of clothing . Sweaters , skirts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college girl . Low-heeled white-and-tan saddle oxfords or moccasins , socks , and soft head-gear , complete the everyday costume . Dance and dinner dresses and one Sunday dress-up costume are also essentials , for at some schools girls are not permitted to wear sweaters to dinner . Since the same type of costume is worn for four years , the college girl is not greatly concerned with extremes of fashion , except for her one formal daytime costume . Clothes That Are Generally Flattering From about the middle of the 1920 's certain styles in women 's and misses ' ready-to-wear have continued to sell in various price ranges . Ordinarily in the fashion field , when a particular style of hat or coat is copied in less expensive fabric with less costly labor and findings , the original article no longer sells at the higher price . There has been a reversal of this principle of fashion merchandising in America . The reason for this reversal lies in the fact that when American women find an article that adequately meets their needs as to practicality , becomingness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of its price . For example , the shirtwaist dress , introduced and advertised by Best and Company in New York City as the " Shirtmaker " dress , has continued to sell since 1926 . It has sold at all prices . In 1941 the dress was made in wool gabardine and sold at $39.50 . Other materials made in the same style were priced at $19.75 , $25.00 , and $29.50 . Copies or adaptations have sold in all lower-priced brackets for $12.75 , $8.75 , $4.75 , $2.98 , and even lower . One manufacturer of this particular style of dress has run three factories and given work to several contractors . What accounts for this amazing popularity of one type of apparel ?  | The shirtwaist-type dress is two-piece and stitched together at the waistline , made with a center-front closing , a yoke , a collar , and a fitted skirt with its fullness in pleats or released in shaped gores . The dress may be worn for any daytime occasion anywhere at any time of year . Some women change the buttons to jeweled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in most dress materials , as cottons , rayon or silk crepes , spun rayons , flannel , gabardine and other twills , printed silks , and even in rich fabrics such as velvet and chiffon in longer versions for evening wear . Taffeta and other stiff cloth and such materials as matelasse are not used for this type of dress as they are too bulky . The simplicity of the style makes it suitable for wear morning or afternoon . It is equally at home in the grocery market at eight-thirty in the morning , the business office from nine to five , or at the bridge party at four o'clock . Certain factors which contribute to the success of the shirtwaist dress are enumerated here for the purpose of guiding readers in analyzing other styles that develop from time to time . The details that make this dress generally becoming include the center-front closing , the collar or high-shaped neckline , the shoulder yoke , the sleeve with slight padding or fullness at the top , the waist with its fullness stitched in place , and the slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , carrying the eye to the face and down rather than across the figure . The yoke , which holds the shoulder and sleeve in place , releases fullness over the bust thus giving a soft effect . The small collar is trim and neat and generally adds to the illusion of height . When the collar is omitted , the neckline is shaped in a curve that is more flattering than a straight " V-shaped " or square neckline . The skirt appears snug fitting at the hipline , yet the pleats or flared gores provide ample fullness for walking and sitting . American women will not accept tight skirts that cause the figure to appear to bulge when seated . When the wearer stands , the skirt of the shirtwaist dress hangs straight giving a straight line at the sides and thus furthering the illusion of slenderness or height . Slight fullness in the waist above the fitted waist and hipline makes the hips appear smaller . In 1940 the dolman shoulderline was introduced for coats . Although this was a new silhouette to many , those garment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular twenty years  | ago were able to design coats that met with instant success . A changed shoulder requires a completely different bodyline . The full waist used with this dolman or sloping shoulder should be balanced with a straight , tight hipline . Other silhouettes that have been popular over a long period of time in all price ranges include the princess or reefer silhouette , and the draped , bloused , bolero , pinafore or dirndl , and Tuxedo silhouettes . The princess or reefer silhouette is used for all kinds of coats , dresses , and housecoats and is flattering because its numerous sections or gores increase the height and accent the waistline . The small collar and center-front closing also add height . Slight padding at the shoulder makes the hips appear smaller . The simplicity of the coat makes it acceptable for the woman with a problem figure . Only the woman who is very fat must avoid this silhouette . Slight draping in the sleeve , bodice , or skirt of the draped silhouette achieves that softness so desirable in concealing bad figures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create the illusion of slenderness by their contrast to the tight waist and hipline . The dirndl and pinafore silhouettes with their tight waists and wide shoulders are gay , youthful , and flattering for the slender figure . The Tuxedo coat , with its neckline falling from the shoulder to the hemline , adds height . The contrast in color to the suit or dress also increases the apparent height . Sleeve treatments that are becoming include the regulation suit sleeve , the slightly padded shoulder , short puffed sleeves , short cape , epaulettes , and the bertha collar . Necklines that are most flattering include those with small collar , V-necklines that add apparent length to the face , and the surplice , draped , and cowl necklines which adapt themselves to the figure of the wearer . The Sizes of Clothing Women 's and misses ' dresses , coats , and suits are made in six size ranges : regular , misses , junior miss , little women , and half sizes and stouts . Sometimes a short-stout range , corresponding to the half-size range but made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no relation of size to age . Regulars are sized for the woman five feet and seven inches in height who wears a size sixteen dress with no alteration . For many years all manufacturers made  |  garments for this size range . Alterations were frequent , however , as statistics show that the average , or eighty per cent of American women , are about five feet and five inches tall and weigh one hundred and forty pounds or more . Thus the five-feet-seven-inch girl is tall and not average . This discovery concerning sizes prompted many manufacturers to change their size range , and the little women 's or half-size range was developed . This size is made for the mature woman with well developed bust , arms , and hips . Many customers think that a misses ' size sixteen corresponds to a thirty-four , size eighteen to a thirty-six , and size twenty to a thirtyeight . This is not altogether accurate as misses ' sizes 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , and 20 are made for the figure that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the small older woman . The woman 's size range is devised for the more mature person . This range includes 32 , 34 , 36 , 38 , 40 , 42 , 44 , 46 , 48 , 50 , and 52 . The half-size range is made for the shorter person ; the waist and skirt lengths are shorter than are those in the women 's range . This range includes 12%,14% , 161/2 , 18 ' /2 , 20i/2 , 22i/2 , 24%2 , and 26i/2 . Junior miss sizes are for the slender girl or the small woman . The bustline is high and the hips are narrow . The sizes include 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , and 17 . Many older women wear this range . Stouts are for the heavy-set figure . The sizes include 37 , 39 , 41 , 43 , 45 , 47 , 49 , 51 , and 53 . Short-stout sizes include 34%2 , 36%2 , 38%2 , 40%2 , 42 ' /2 , 44%2 , 46%2 , 48% , 50 ' /2 , and 52 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but many buyers will accept special orders . In an attempt to simplify and standardize the sizes used in apparel industries the Bureau of Standards , co-operating with the National Retail Dry Goods Association , proposed , in February 1939 , a suggested size classification corresponding to average body measurements . It is hoped that a recognition and adoption of this revised size classification will eliminate confusion .

The wise investor spends the largest percentage of his clothing budget for the clothes that he wears most of the time , and buys those items that will give him most satisfaction over a long period of time . A well-known retail store selling higher-priced apparel specified wool fabric and tailoring for a summer coat that retailed for about $10.00 . The styling of this garment was such that it could be worn with any summer costume for town or country , day or evening . The buyer says that many of the store 's customers have worn these coats for three years with complete satisfaction . It is no longer considered wise to spend most of the wardrobe budget for an evening costume or a Sunday afternoon outfit , and to leave insufficient funds for the everyday clothes . Many mistakes are made in apportioning money for clothing . There is the girl who spends all of her clothing allowance on a fur jacket leaving no money for a raincoat or a warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conscious of pretty legs and ankles , wears thin chiffon hose and extreme and fragile pumps , and does not even possess a sensible pair of walking shoes . There is the girl  | who buys an extravagant ski costume and finds that there is very little snow and that her crowd has taken up skating . There are the women who have hobbies for buying many items of the same character although they have no one complete costume .

Fifty-nine per cent of the class spent less than the average $230 , while 41 per cent went above , said Miss Rathbone . This 13-year record of the average wardrobe expenditures for students in an advanced home economics class closely follows the American prosperity curve . Peak expenditure of $516 came in a boom year , 1927 , and the low of $210 was reached in the depression year of 1933 .

Silk hosiery may be as few in number as five pairs on the minimum expense sheet , or as many as 60 pairs on the maximum . The price range is from 49 cents to $1 , but the usual cost is 79 cents , according to the reports . In 1937 the average number of hose per co-ed was 26 pairs .

A straight-line suit skirt that fits the figure closely should be worn slightly longer . The skirt length should be considered also in relation to standing , walking , and sitting . A tight skirt may look very well fairly short while the wearer is standing , but when she is seated the contours of her body are revealed in a very unattractive manner . Shops designing the most expensive custom-made suits observe rigid rules concerning skirts ; they never allow a skirt to leave the shop unless it looks well when its wearer is seated . Skirts made with gores or sections cut on the bias , and summer suits and dresses of washable material , should have their hemlines  | adjusted frequently , as the bottoms of such garments change in length with wear . With short skirts such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adequate underclothing , consisting of a slip or petticoat and a panty girdle , should be worn . A good rule to remember for the street skirt or the skirt of a suit worn in the office is that the skirt should cover the top of the knee when the legs arc crossed at the knee . Skirts for evening wear , likewise , may vary in length according to the width of the skirt and the occasion for which the dress is worn . A fairly slender skirt may have a slight train in the back and reach almost to the floor in front . A full chiffon or organdy skirt for ( lancing should be two or three inches from the floor so that it may not trip its wearer . Dances such as the conga and rhumba require shorter skirts . Before appearing in public in an evening dress the wearer should practise walking upstairs to learn how to ' manage a long skirt . There is a technique of walking to prevent stepping on the skirt when walking upstairs . A light skirt may be held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold up the skirt of a very full dress gracefully . Shoulder detail in trapunto Large knees and ankles may be made work and a single-breasted closing make this jacket dress to appear smaller by the wearing of dark a good choice for the larger stockings or stockings that have been dyed than average woman while in ombre effect ? that is , stockings in it is also flattering for the average or slender person . which the front is lighter than the back . ( Courtesy Ronwit Teller . ) This particular distribution of color creates the illusion of slenderness . The person with heavy knees or unattractive legs should wear dress skirts slightly longer than the extreme fashion permits . Skirts two or three inches longer than the current accepted fashion , however , give the appearance of ? age and are to be avoided . Gaining or losing weight will alter the length of a skirt . Woolen suits and coats should have their hems changed by a tailor equipped to steam and press the garment properly .  | The Individual Selects Color in . Apparel Theoretically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , analogous and double complementary ? may be devised . In the selection of clothing , however , these principles of color harmony are not always demonstrable because the exact color desired is not readily obtainable . In interior decoration a wide variety of materials are available ; suitable paints may be blended for the background ; accents may be provided in room accessories or picture frames . But in the purchase of ready-to-wear , the selection must be based on the merchandise available in a particular price range at a given time . The most flattering colors As the major item in the wardrobe , the winter coat determines the color scheme . The most popular or best-selling colors in this garment are : black , worn because of its economy and smartness , soft dark reds , blue-greens , navy and lighter shades of blue , and variations in browns . Gray , in some textures , is a flattering color but it is not always available . Dark browns have been unobtainable in the dress-coat market until recently . Black has held a superiority in volume for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be less worn than in former years . While black is not flattering unless relieved by a bright dress , scarf , blouse , jewelry , or hat , it remains both smart and economical , for the individual wearing black becomes less tired of it than of brighter colors , and a good black garment may be worn for several seasons without becoming dated . The person who must economize should avoid street coats in too brilliant coloring as bright red , brilliant red-orange , bright blue or bright green . These colors may be selected for occasional or sportswear jackets or short coats , but they are not suitable for everyday town wear . If the person has a basic ( lark coat a bright coat is a good second choice . How to Make Unbecoming Colors in A pparel More Flattering Many times a color that is not particularly beautiful is used for a garment that in other ways is desirable . It may he an excellent design , have fine workmanship and correct lit . For example , covert  | for many years was made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a dull light taupe that was not particularly flattering . In 1940 a wide range of colors was produced in this cloth , though there is still a great deal of covert that is not generally flattering to skin tones . Long-wearing , durable , fairly inexpensive covert suits , topcoats , dresses , skirts , and jackets are desirable . They may be made more becoming by the use of a flattering color near the face . A soft green , coral , red , or bright blue scarf , tie , sweater , or dress will relieve the somberness of the neutral color . A salesgirl selling in the suit department when gray predominated in the stock always showed the gray jacket with a bright red printed scarf . When the suit was shown without the scarf , customers complained that they did not like the color . This use of flattering colors near the face is frequently incorporated into garments by the best designers of women 's and misses ' apparel . Evening dresses with a pastel chiffon yoke , ruffle , or other arrangement of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scarf or collar of contrasting color also relieves the drabness of an unattractive color . Even the presence of as small an item as a necklace , or a pin , or of colored nail polish may be sufficient to relieve an otherwise somber color . Cosmetics ? lipstick , powder and rouge ? may be changed slightly to harmonize pleasingly with colors in the wardrobe . If neutral or achromatic colors such as black , gray , dull brown , and tan draw the color from the face , a lipstick of more intense color may be used . Colorings bordering on purple-red with a cast of blue should be worn with a lipstick and rouge of this same color family . Orangyreds and light brown should be worn with an orange-red rather than a blue-red lipstick . This difference in the color in the lipstick may be noted if several colors are compared . Another means of making unflattering colors flattering is redying . Dry cleaners have much success with redyeing outer garments . This change of color applies even to hair colors ? if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hair may be corrected by tinting or coloring . Eyelashes that are colorless and give the individual a negative expression may be colored with mascara or , in the case of a man , they may be dyed . Fading by the sun , illness , or a natural lack of pigmentation may account for this lack of color . If the eyelashes are seemingly absent the eyes have a peculiar expression .  | How to Change the Color Scheme in the Wardrobe From One Basic Color to Another Girls from school desiring to go into the business world or girls coming from the country to the city almost always find that the basic colors in their wardrobes are unsatisfactory . The college girl has countless sweaters , plaid skirts , a raincoat or reversible , many jackets , and dance and evening dresses , but she lacks the necessary business dress , suit , or coat . As most people can not buy and continue to wear an entirely new wardrobe including hats , shoes , gloves , and handbags , a way must be found to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The college girl may do this by selecting a color for her new wardrobe that may be worn with both the predominant colors in her old and the new colors that she hopes to wear in the future . For instance , she may find that among her sweaters and skirts colors such as red or coral predominate . Her first step in changing her basic wardrobe scheme , then , would be to select a street coat in blue or black , and shoes , hat , and bag which may be worn with the red plaids . The next season she may buy a black dress or a black suit . Or , if her sports clothes harmonize more effectively with dark brown , she may select that color instead of black . Two other colors which may be satisfactorily used in such a transition are light brown , such as a luggage tan , which will help to change a costume from black to brown , and dark red which may be used to change a costume from black to blue , tan , gray , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable for year-round wear . Color Combinations to Avoid Occasionally skilled designers combine black with brown , or green with blue , or orange with purple in a striking costume , and the effect may be very beautiful . However , for the average individual , black and brown ? except in furs ? is not the best combination . A beaver coat may be worn with a black dress , or a mink collar may top a black coat ; but furs have depth and a beautiful coloring that is not easily duplicated in fabric . Dark reds do not go well with orange or brilliant red in merchandise . Purple may be worn with pink , but it is too similar to red to be worn effectively with it . Gray with brown is another combination that is not becoming to most people . A navy  | blue dress or suit may be worn with a black hat , shoes , and bag , but a black suit or dress does not go well with navy blue accessories . White and natural are too closely related to go well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suit , or dress look dirty . The Person with Strikingly Beautiful Coloring The woman or man with splendid physique , flawless complexion , high coloring , and beautiful hair may wear any color becomingly . Beautiful , cultured women , it is observed , select colors for their day and evening dresses to complement their coloring rather than to add to it . White and black are frequently chosen by the most beautiful women because dresses in these colorings provide a background for their natural coloring . Seldom do outstandingly beautiful women or girls wear brilliant red evening dresses or other " loud " costumes . Colors for the Individual Manufacturers of fabrics have recently been devising colors that are generally flattering and , working in co-operation with them , cosmetic manufacturers have been perfecting flattering colors in rouge , lipstick , and powder . No enumeration of a limited list of colors for each color type will be made here ; rather , emphasis will be placed on a few of the colors that persons of different coloring should avoid . Since sun-tan or long illness change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into consideration by the individual when choosing colors for clothing . The person who has a sun-tan should avoid browns and colors that blend with the skin and should wear colors that present a striking contrast , as white , blue , or chartreuse . The person who has been ill should avoid both neutral or achromatic colors ? such as gray , tan , or beige ? and brilliant intense colors until the natural coloring of the skin is restored . The person with brunette coloring The brunette with brown eyes and dark hair must avoid intensifying the brownish color of the skin . The all-brown costume , if selected , should be relieved with white or some other contrasting color . Navy blue is not the best color for the brunette ; a lighter blue of middle value or blue-green is more becoming . Off-white is more  | flattering than pure white . Pastels are not the best colors , except for evening wear . Pale pink particularly causes the average brunette skin to look dark . Of course there are exceptions to this rule . The brunette with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright red and dark red and also in beige and certain shades of gray . Brilliant blue and brilliant green worn in small accessories and for sportswear , are attractive with neutral colors . Purple , if not too intense and if the skin is light , may be worn by the brunette . The person with composite coloring The individual with hair neither blonde nor brunette and eyes neither brown nor blue must avoid the negative or " mousy " look that results when gray , taupe , or other colors too near the hair coloring are selected . Colors of middle value are most effective for this person . Blue , navy blue , dark green , ( lark red , and dark brown provide a striking contrast to the hair . A blue of middle value may cause gray eyes to appear blue and a corresponding green may cause the eyes to appear green . The brilliant spectrum colors are too overpowering for this individual , and therefore softer intermediate colors should he selected . The person with blonde coloring Healthy blonde hair is so beautiful if properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to select colors that harmonize with it . Black in woolen or opaque material is too somber for the individual with blonde coloring , but black transparent material such as lace or chiffon is an excellent choice for evening wear , and black relieved with white may be worn for street wear . If the eyes are blue , the family of middle blues may always be successfully worn . Gray with a bluish cast is another good choice . Pastels , particularly yellow , are very effective . Intense spectrum colors are too overpowering . A person of blonde coloring may wear red and yellow in hats or sweaters , or in blouses for evening wear . Purple of middle value is another excellent choice for the blonde person . The red-haired person The red- or titian-haired individual possesses such striking natural coloring that it is impossible to ignore it . Intense colors should he  | avoided by such a person : bright green , as it is too ordinary ; most reds , purples , blues of middle value , orchid , chartreuse , cerise , and vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same family as the hair is a wise choice . This includes all of the range of browns , taupes , and beige . If the hair is quite bright , oxford gray or blue may be worn . The red-haired person with blue eyes may wear a soft shade of blue , although blue is not the best choice . The gray-haired person Gray-haired women if properly coifed may be very distinguished looking . This fact may be observed at social gatherings where many distinguished , poised , and elegantly dressed gray-haired women officiate as leaders in social life and business . In many cases , the unattractive appearance of yellowish-gray is eliminated by the use of a light tint of blue in the hair rinse . A slight orchid coloring is also flattering for gray-haired women . When expertly done , this tinting is not at all obvious , producing something of an aura that is barely perceptible . Unless the individual has high coloring and an unusual degree of vivacity , long-sleeved , high-necked solid black is to be avoided because of its association with age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hats or evening wear , all variations of blues , blue-green , soft greens , purples , if not too intense , and white are splendid selections . Unless the complexion is quite clear , brown is not the best choice for the gray-haired person , while gray is most effective either with the costume entirely in that color or relieved by a brighter color .

THE old Mother-Goose rhyme clearly dramatizes the significance of seemingly trivial things . Many minor faults of personal grooming hinder the progress and success of countless individuals . " Your best friend wo n't tell you , " explains the character of some of these faults . Personal uncleanliness , untidy hair , badly manicured fingernails , bad breath , a general look of fatigue or indifference , or faulty posture ruin the effect of the most attractive costume . General Business Demeanor The wearing of perfume in a business office or constantly clinking charm bracelets annoys many workers . Standing with hands in the pockets or with arms crossed indicates indifference , lack of respect , or lack of attention . Several buyers have said that they will not permit gum-chewing in their departments by even the best sales person . Employment managers frequently look at an applicant 's feet to see if excessively high heels are worn . They know that badly fitted shoes soon become uncomfortable and cause excess fatigue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reflected partly in faulty posture and fatigue . Bad breath caused  | by excessive smoking , drinking alcoholic beverages , or decayed or unclean teeth mark an individual as one to be avoided . A large dress-manufacturing firm recently investigated to discover why their salesman could not sell to Fifth Avenue stores . They found that the salesman in question smoked a " black cigar , " and that the habits he had of not removing his hat and of smoking without permission in their presence so offended the women buyers that they made their business contacts with him as brief as possible . A new salesman , impeccable in personal habits and courtesy , immediately obtained the orders . Young men enlisted in the army or navy soon become aware of the strictness of military orders concerning personal habits . Meticulous care and attention to the details of personal grooming are , therefore , of vital importance today . The following suggestions on grooming are included not only for those who may profit personally by such suggestions , but also for those who may be guiding , directing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment . It is wiser to call an offender 's attention to an annoying and easily remedied fault than to train another person for the position . The staff of an expensive private school , or the manager of a motion picture actor or actress , are as insistent about the personal appearance as they are about the professional ability of their students or clients . ' A check list that has proved of value to many students is included in this chapter . Its use has demonstrated that few willing persons are too uncouth , awkward , ugly , or otherwise handicapped to be improved by the application of intelligent grooming techniques . Posture Without correct shoes it is impossible to walk or stand properly . Shoes that are obviously too short , too tight , too high-heeled , and too fragile adequately to support the feet are often seen on the streets today . The effect of aching feet is reflected in the face and the posture . The wearer is unaware of the feet , however , if the shoes are sensible and correctly fitted . American women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College girls prefer the low-heeled saddle oxford , yet some women still think that a shoe with high French heels is most attractive for walking . Pumps are not designed as walking shoes but , when new or well-cared-for , they are attractive . worn for evening , dinner , or a leisurely hour at tea  | time . The director of a salon selling the highest-priced shoes in New York City always inquires of customers the use to which they mean to put the shoes that they are buying . He watches the way a woman walks in her shoes to determine exactly the heel height she needs for walking and business wear , and insists that women who do a great deal of walking buy walking shoes . Women 's and misses ' shoes for street and business wear should have heels of medium height and an adequate support over the instep . Many sales- and businesswomen keep a pair of oxfords in their locker or desk drawer and change to shoes with higher heels for the evening . Good posture demands ease and grace in standing , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , walk tall , " is a simple direction for improving the posture . Girls and women standing for long hours on their feet also need adequate foundation garments to insure correct posture . Girdles and corsets should be properly fitted by a corsetiere who corrects the length of bones and sees to it that the garment will be comfortable whether the wearer is sitting or standing . Unfortunately , many women and girls refuse to wear adequately boned foundation garments because they believe that these are uncomfortable . Lastex yarns , fashioned in lightweight nets and other fabrics , permit garments to control the figure without discomfort . No woman or girl is properly dressed unless she is correctly girdled . Small , slender girls may wear a soft pantie girdle . Wide , spreading hips are not attractive . The wearing of the correct foundation prevents this unsightly figure development . A careful study of the figure from the front , side , and rear in triplicate mirrors should be made every month . Many college girls with overdeveloped muscles in hips and thighs are unaware of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knees when a short skirt is worn is offensive in any office . Many otherwise efficient young women lose their positions because of perhaps innocent but nevertheless improper posture . The restraint exercised by a correct foundation garment prevents to some extent " sloppy " posture and bad sitting positions . The Hair The natural head of hair of a healthy person is lustrous and generally slightly curly . Daily brushing , a weekly shampoo , and rca-  | sonable care in avoiding exposure to intense rays of the sun and wind are minimum requirements for keeping the hair in a healthy condition . Dry hair needs oil , and oily hair needs alcohol to eliminate the excessive oil . Massage , which is the secret of all hair-growing remedies , may be done at home at no cost . The practice of wearing tight hats or of wearing a hat for long hours indoors prevents circulation and therefore is injurious to the hair . The arrangement of the hair should be harmonious to both the face and the figure of the individual , and should also be suited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural curl of the hair . The coiffure of women and girls should be appropriate to the occasion . Intricate curls and twists are too elaborate for business wear . Professional care at a beauty shop is not always possible for the person of low income . When a coiffure or new hair arrangement that involves cutting the hair is planned , the best obtainable professional hair dresser should be consulted . A becoming hair arrangement can be worn for many months and the operator will demonstrate the best way to keep it in place . Hair that is cut too short loses its natural charm . Men frequently wear their hair too short . Sometimes only a little extra length is needed to balance a heavy nose or jawline . Elderly women , or The professional hair stylist devises coiffures flattering to the features and suitable to the color , texture , and amount of hair .

Permanent waves , helpful in keeping the hair in place attractively , require skilled operators if they are to be successful . Many women and girls look better with their hair straight ? if it really lacks natural curl and is of a good color and abundant . The color of the hair usually determines its texture . Blonde hair does not always look so well in certain coiffures as does darker or brunette hair . d According to a representative of a large cosmetic house , only five mature women in a hundred wear their hair the natural color without tint , rinse , or dye .

Streaked or sun-bleached hair needs revitalizing , and a tint will improve its color until it grows into better condition . Dyeing , or permanent coloring of the hair , is expensive and demands regular attention . The best hair operators do not recommend the dyeing of hair unless this is absolutely necessary . However , in order to keep a coveted position , a person working in an office where an appearance of youth must be maintained is justified in dyeing the hair if it is turning gray rapidly . The Shape of the Face  | The famous Hollywood make-up experts , the Westmore brothers , classify face shapes into seven basic types : oval , round , oblong , square , triangular , inverted triangular , and diamond . The heavy nose and the heavy jawline are other features which must be considered . The ideal face is oval and slightly narrow at the chin . The hair of the person with this type of face , and with regular features and a healthy complexion , may be arranged in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is important to recognize the shape of the face and to know what effect is desired . This chart shows lace shapes .  | How to determine the shape of the face In *order to arrange the : hair and place the powder ands rouge properly , it is necessary to recognize the natural shape of the face . The questioning of adults and college students as to their general coloring and the shape of their faces has revealed the fact that many people do not know the answers to such questions . Often they do not even know whether their coloring is blonde or brunette . The shape of the face may be determined by a comparison with other face types . The ideal , as we have said , is the oval shape , and the object in both hair arrangement and powder and rouge placement is to achieve an illusion of this shape . Long hair arranged to change apparent shape of face It is not always necessary to have long hair cut in order to have an attractive coiffure . Sometiirles , however , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to curl is pulled or brushed out . If long hair is attractive in color and texture , it may be . arranged in many interesting ways . A few locks may be cut short in front to soften a severe " skin-tight " effect , or bangs may be cut to cover a too-high forehead . This may be done without sacrificing the long back hair . Skillful thinning may be required if the hair is too thick for the size and features of the individual . Professional thinning is done with a razor and can not be detected . Other coiffures for long hair include the halo roll in braids around the top of the head , tight braids or rolls of hair in a chignon or figure eight effect at the back of the head , braids arranged at the top of the head to give the appearance of height , and the pompadour or angel roll done with a ribbon or sn ill cylinder of hair as a base . The oval face The person who has a naturally well-shaped face should not change its contour by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle . No low side part should be worn ; rather , the natural " widow 's peak , " or hairline , should be shown . Bangs do not add to the appearance unless the individual is very tall . Eyebrows should be kept natural , and the curve of the mouth should follow the line of the lips . Hair Arrangement Should Improve the Features Wrong Right Right Right s '  --  ' Right Square Wrong Oval Face . Wrong Thin Wrong Right 91 . , ? " O. ; la I kart-shaped Wrong 100 , ,  | The round face Since the face of this shape frequently accompanies excess weight , the round-faced person should try to achieve a triangular effect in coiffure . This may be done with a high side part and the hair curled so that width may be obtained at the top of the head extending out from the forehead . Small , tight waves , dips , curls , and bangs should be avoided . Softness in hair arrangement is essential , for a sleek , sophisticated coiffure is not in keeping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside of the cheek and carried up into the hairline . Darker rouge creates the illusion of greater width . The lips should be made up wide at the sides to reduce the distance from the corner of the mouth to the jawline . The square face Children , girls , and occasionally mature women having this type of face and naturally straight hair sometimes want to accentuate the squareness of the jawline by wearing a Dutch bob and bangs . While this arrangement is satisfactory for the younger person or for the tall woman with a clear complexion and a heavy head of lustrous hair of a pleasing color , the average person with a square face prefers a less severe hair arrangement . Small , tight curls are out of character with this face , and hair pulled directly back from the forehead throws the chin into prominence . The hair should be fairly long , as a short bob reveals the unattractive contour of the head at the sides and back . This is especially true if the hair is thin and blonde or gray in color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair softly below the ears and the side of the head . The hair at the forehead should be arranged softly by having some locks of hair cut shorter than the rest . Rouge should be placed in a circle below the eye and back towards the ear . The jawline may be minimized by a dark foundation cream on the side of the face or by carrying the rouge down to the chin . This dark effect creates a shadow on the wide part of the face . Thin eyebrows are wrong for the square face ; rather , a natural curve should be used . Lipstick should be applied to create as wide an effect as possible . The cupid's-bow effect is not pleasing , nor is the thin mouth .  | The oblong face Theoretically , the shape of the face is in proportion to the size of the body ; but actually women 's figures change ; waistlines thicken , hips become broad , and the slender face may accompany a heavy body . If such a person wishes to appear taller , the hair arrangement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the most flattering for the shape of the face . Girls and women five feet and three inches in height may wear their hair piled in pompadour effect or curled on top of their heads to create an illusion of height . Ribbon of a color that contrasts with the hair may be worn at the top of the head to further this effect . The person of average height and weight with an oblong face needs softness at the side to make the face appear rounder . This may be done with a rolled or curled effect that shows behind the ears . Center and low parts should be avoided . This coiffure requires long hair in front , though the hair may be bobbed in the back . The rouge worn by a person with an oblong face should be light in tone and blended in a circle . The eyebrows should be natural and not extended to the side , as this makes the forehead look too wide and the chin too narrow . Natural placing of the lipstick with the lower lip full is a pleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face is similar to the round face except that the forehead is narrower . An illusion of width at the forehead may be created by wearing the hair swept back from the brow in loose curls . A fairly high side part may be worn , but the hair should be brushed back nevertheless , thus creating the illusion of length . At the side , the hair arrangement should taper below the cars . Frequently the person with a triangular face has a short neck , shortened even further by the wearing of a long bob . Mature women may wear the upswept coiffure in back and at the sides of the hair . Girls and young women , however , look too mature in this hair arrangement ? unless they desire to appear older .  | The extra width of the jawline may he reduced by using a darker foundation over this line or by carrying the rouge down along it . Eyebrows should be natur ' . il-looking . If lipstick is applied to make the mouth seem wider , the width of the jawlinr is reduced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top of the head . Width at the eye line is effective for a broad face . Soft effects arc desirable for the angular face . A large chin is balanced with massed hair at the back of the head . A prominent nose is seemingly reduced by curls at the forehead . Side curls with a long bob help correct the same problem . A turned-up nose requires bangs turned under instead of up . The color , texture , quantity and quality of the hair determines arrangement . Fashions change but the wise individual knows the most flattering effect for her own features and adapts the new fashion to her particular use .  | of rouge on the chin makes the chin more prominent and creates the illusion of greater length . The inverted triangular face The person who has a narrow chin and a wide forehead gives the appearance of pouting ? a rather disagreeable expression for business and social life . Long hair softly curled can correct this appearance . The tips of the ears may be allowed to show , thus making the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be avoided , as that arrangement carries the line at the forehead outward and makes the chin appear even narrower . Rouge should be placed fairly high toward the temple . Eyebrows should look natural . The mouth should be arched slightly with the upper lip curved into a cupid-bow effect . The diamond-shaped face The face with a narrow forehead , narrow chin , and broad jawline looks well with hangs or curls arranged at the top of the forehead . If the curls are carried out to the side of the head , the forehead appears wider and the chin narrower . Rouge should be applied fairly.high and out toward the ear . The eyebrows should be arched , and , since a wide mouth with a narrow chin looks displeasing , no attempt should be made to increase the width of the lips . Acquiring the Well-Groomed Look . " The first requirement for good grooming is cleanliness , " according to Miss Miriam Gibson , Beauty Stylist of Shulton , Incorporated , of New York City . " A clean skin is the first requisite for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oily , coarse or fine , soap and water should be used as a cleansing agent . Many complexions require creams to lubricate and soften them , but whether or not creams are used , soap and water have a definite place on the list of good-grooming requisites . The old-fashioned theory that soap and water are drying or injurious to the tender facial skin , long since has been exploded . That old wives ' tale grew out of the fact that most women did not know the proper procedure for the use of soap . " Miss Gibson recommends the following rules to bring vitality and glow to the complexion . 1 . Choose a line quality , super-fatted soap , which agrees with the individual skin texture .  | 2 . Soap lather should be applied with a washcloth or complexion brush and gently but firmly rubbed into the skin . This assists the blood to come to the facial surface to " flush " the skin of impurities. 3 . Wash off the soap thoroughly with warm water . 4 . Rinse and pat the face with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Every clean skin should have some kind of protection from the natural elements whether they be coldness or summer heat , " says Miss Gibson . The particular type used , light lotion or make-up foundation , depends upon the individual skin type or texture . There are two types of rouge , dry , known as compact rouge , and paste rouge . The latter is applied before the face powder ; the former over the face powder . For many years , rouge has been used by women to bring greater color to their faces ; but there are other uses for rouge , the most important of which is to give an illusionary remolding of the face . The oval face is accepted by beauty experts as the perfect shape , but the perfectly oval face is rare . The jawline may be too heavy , the nose too large , the cheekbones too prominent , and many other faults are evident in the average woman 's face . But these faults may be minimized , the better features emphasized , by the proper use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placing of rouge . According to Miss Gibson , rouge should be placed on the perfect face ( the oval type ) at the point of natural color . The round face may be lengthened and narrowed by rouge , the long , thin face shortened and widened , the square face given an oval appearance . Color attracts the eye . If rouge is placed at the outer edges of the cheeks , the face has greater width ; if applied fairly close to the nose , the face is narrowed . A long face is shortened by rouge placed low on cheeks ; it is lengthened by rouge placed high . These are general rules . An extreme application of these principles will exaggerate the very fault one is attempting to conceal . Each idea must be adapted to the individual facial structure . High cheekbones will become less obvious when rouge is placed slightly below the actual bone ? however , not too low to exaggerate the imperfection . Rouged ear tips give an illusion of width to the face . A spot of color at the tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of rouge at the tip of the chin shortens the face . If a woman 's facial characteristics include a large nose ? which becomes less promi-  | nent when rouge is placed not too close to it , and a wide face ? which is narrowed when rouge is placed near the nose , it is necessary to experiment and achieve a happy medium by playing down the more obvious of the imperfections . Paste rouge has many advantages over the dry type . It gives a more natural appearance because it blends into the skin more easily , under the face powder . Once applied , it lasts much longer than compact rouge , never needing " touching up " ; but it is more difficult to apply expertly . This type of rouge should be used sparingly . With the fingertip apply it lightly in three spots , then blend perfectly , allowing the edges to fade into the skin tones . Compact rouge , placed after the application of face powder , is applied more heavily , then covered by a second film of powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blending with the skin . The average skin has more yellow than pink pigment ; therefore it needs the lift and brightening given it by the use of blue-red rouge and matching , or blending , lipstick . Orange-red make-up is becoming to young skins , a few light-skinned blondes and red heads , and a very rare light-skinned brunette . The woman with mediumtoned hair and complexion is given greater radiance through the use of blue-red make-up . Too dark a make-up has a tendency to dull the face as a whole ; too light a make-up makes the face " fade , " giving no definite impression . " The choice of face powder is an important one , " says Miss Gibson . Skin tones and texture must be studied and understood . In most cases , a light-textured face powder flatters the complexion , enhancing a woman 's own natural beauty rather than masking its radiance and vitality . A powder too light in color has a tendency to make the skin appear darker than its natural color by contrast . A rosy-toned powder gives a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sallow complexion . A florid face may be toned down by the use of a monotone or rachel type color . The rare woman who has alabaster-like skin may emphasize it by the absence of rouge and the use of rachel powder . The Dresden-china-doll type of woman , with fragile skin , is one of the few who use a very pale pinky-toned powder to good advantage . Lipstick has become known as woman 's badge of courage . It is as much a part of her everyday needs as the comb and brush for her hair and the shoes for her feet . The day when lipstick was used  | only to give a natural color to the lips is long past . Today , lipstick is used to accent the entire face . Besides the shades found in the individual complexion , costume colors as well must be taken into consideration . If clothes ( such as browns and oranges ) call for an orange type of lipstick and a woman 's natural coloring calls for a blue red , an adaptation must be made so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ensemble colors . Purple , blue , and blue-green costumes call for a lipstick with some blue in it , the amount depending upon the individual coloring of the face . A small mouth will appear larger if the upper lip is darker than the lower , and vice versa . If the natural line of the lips is thin at the outer corners , it may be necessary to give more balance by adding a lipstick outline . However , if the lipstick line is carried out too far , the appearance will be one of harshness and artificiality and will add width to an already broad face . The old-fashioned " cupid 's bow , " so popular in days gone by , gives an illusion of pouting . Too heavy a lower lip gives the same impression . In the application of lipstick , the color should be carried well inside the mouth to avoid an unsightly " line " where the lips close . Lipstick always should be blotted with tissue to avoid smearing , but a few minutes should be given to allow the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric lights tend to fade out the coloring , rouge and make-up colors should be more intense . " Cosmetics , " concludes Miss Gibson , " should be used to enhance a woman 's loveliness , flatter her natural beauty , emphasize her good facial characteristics , and diminish her imperfections . But every woman should remember that she will present a more interesting picture to the world by retaining her own individuality than by trying to be a carbon copy of the popular beauty of the day . The exotic type should dress the part both in make-up and clothes . Likewise , the fragile type should emphasize this rare quality , and the dramatic , sophisticated woman learn to avoid a soft ' appearance . To each woman we say , Be Yourself and Be Beautiful ! ' " Toiletries Since the days of Cleopatra , women have used perfume to enhance their femininity . Today everyone may surround herself with an aura of charm , for complete symphonies of scent appear on the market in a variety of toiletries . Fine perfumed soaps and fragrant  | water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxurious bath . Bath salts , oils , and bubble baths are the various types of water softeners to be found in the stores . A dusting of talc or bath powder imparts a feeling of well-being . A spray of toilet water stimulates and comes under the heading of " necessary luxuries . " All of these beauty requisites help today 's woman to achieve a selfconfidence which comes only when she feels thoroughly a woman . It is only then that she may forget herself to concentrate on the activities of her day . Men , too , have come to know the value of good grooming . No longer is a man 's toilette complete without the use of a masculinely scented after-shave lotion to sooth the skin following the morning shave . Special men 's cologne gives that added touch of luxury so needed by the busy male . A spicy scent , or one of pine , appeals to the most particular man . The use of toiletries is , today , an accepted necessity by the fastidious man , just as important as a shoe-shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manicure Simple , inexpensive articles necessary for the care of the hands may be-purchased for a small sum . The entire equipment necessary for thorough care costs less than the price of one manicure in a first-class shop . A small hand brush , a pointed nail file , manicure scissors , emery boards for filing , cuticle remover , an orangewood stick , and cotton are minimum necessities . Cake nail polish or liquid polish , together with the necessary polish base and remover , may be used if desired . The fingernails of a healthy person have a natural sheen which may be kept in excellent condition by rubbing the fingers of one hand against the fleshy part of the thumb of the opposite hand . This natural appearance is always correct and acceptable . Cake powder heightens this sheen . Liquid polish , if used , should be kept in perfect condition , being removed and put on again as often as is necessary . Too long or badly chipped nails are unsightly . Men and boys , as well as girls and women , require a weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate for keeping the nails in condition . The emery board is used for filing and shaping , and the nails should be left long enough to cover the tips of the fingers . The wearing of excessively long nails  | adds apparent length to the fingers , but exaggerated length is displeasing and gives the wearer an appearance of laziness and indolence . Too short , or bitten or chewed-off nails , are equally offensive . A five-minute scrubbing with a brush , soap , and water follows the filing . A small bit of cotton wrapped around the orangewood stick and saturated with cuticle remover is used to soften the cuticle around the edges of the nails . This extra cuticle should be pushed back with the orangewood stick . This treatment prevents hangnails which are not only painful but unsightly and if neglected may become sources of infection . With the orangewood stick , dirt and dry cuticle is removed from beneath the nails . Liquid polish is applied according to directions . Practise will enable one to apply it evenly and without smudging the sides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , arms , and legs are inexcusable . If a man has heavy , bushy , overpowering eyebrows they should be thinned . Women who wear sheer hose or short dresses should acquire the habit of removing excessive growths of hair . Electrolysis is the only safe method for permanent removal of hair , but it is expensive . Removal by waxes , depilatories , and abrasives such as fine sandpaper or abrasive stones are other methods commonly used . Superfluous hairs on the face should be pulled out with tweezers or removed by electrolysis . Grooming Routine If adequate time is alloted for daily grooming and proper habits are established early , a satisfactory appearance may be maintained without the expenditure of too much time or money . Minimum daily cleanliness requires a bath or shower , the brushing of the teeth at least twice daily , proper application of make-up or a shave , the brushing and combing of the hair , and a brushing of the eyebrows .

More frequent application of polish may be required . p 391 Millinery THE EXTANT illustrations of recorded history show us that headgear has long been regarded as a symbol of rank , authority , or position . Swift athletes were honored with a crown of laurel leaf . The fancy feather headdress identified the native chieftain in prehistoric days as it did among our own American Indians . The jeweled crown is reserved for the king . The cardinal and the bishop wear distinctive hats . The band leader wears a tall , bushy hat of bearskin . The rank of the academic scholar is shown by the mortar-board with the color of the tassel indicating his degree . Army and navy authorities show their recognition of this symbolic significance by their rigid specifications concerning exact details of hats and caps worn by enlisted men . Slaves and peasants have always gone hatless or have worn caps or shawl- or hoodlike head coverings of cloth . The Significance of the Hat More than any other article of apparel , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hats have always appealed to woman 's love of variety . That men , too , enjoy the color and gaiety of fancy headdress may be seen at New Year 's parties when the most , staid business men put on fancy paper hats . The great milliners  - -  who are usually artists with an understanding of merchandising ? sense this desire for newness and provide a constantly changing array of new ideas interpreted in hats . Radical , fantastic , and absurd as some new hat styles seem , these creations , nevertheless , focus consumer attention on millinery. .1lie publicity , promotion , and attention given to new hats quickly make  | old hats obsolete . The leading milliners formerly showed new collections weekly . Because of the relation of the hat to the face of the wearer , the coiffure , the coat , the collar , and the general design of the costume , a radical change in hat styles frequently presages an entire change of silhouette in apparel . Important Styles Many popular types of hats are directly inspired by historic . costumes or paintings . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artist , Charles Dana Gibson . The Watteau hat ? that small forward-perched disc of straw or fabric with its shaped headband of the same material ? is borrowed directly from the paintings of Jean Watteau , the famous French artist . The shako , a plain , high-cuffed , unadorned hat , - resembles the hat of a Russian soldier . The snood , ornamental hairnet of braid , chenille , or yarn is taken from costumes of the fifteenth century . The headdress of an Indian gentleman , composed of fabric tightly rolled around the head , inspired our popular turban . The most popular street hat is the snap-brim felt or straw with its round or peaked crown and brim that may be worn up in the back and down in front to suit the face of the wearer . The pillbox , a simple , small , round , disk-like hat , is made in all mediums . The ever-popular Breton , with wide , turned-up brim , and the off-the-face hat with brim in front only , are most popular in felt . The cloche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best-selling style . The beret , Tyrolean , and pork-pie hat styles have likewise achieved wide popularity . Materials Used for Hats Hats are made of felt , straw , fabric , leather , yarn , fur , and combinations of these materials . Felts are either wool or fur , depending upon the kind of material used . Fur felts are higher priced and keep their shape longer than wool felts . In 1941 a new felt made with Aralac , a casein or synthetic yarn made from milk , was launched . Velours are brushed or napped felts emerized to produce a velvety surface . Fabrics include millinery velvets ? narrow , woven velvets finished especially for hats , plushes , silks such as taffeta , satin ,  | ottoman , and grosgrain , knitted fabrics , and various materials in cotton , rayon , or linen . Leather , such as antelope or suede , is too expensive for popular acceptance . Yarn is made into snoods or turbans . Straws are either natural or synthetic . Natural straws such as panama , leghorn , milan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they are not available in such a wide range of colors . Synthetic straws , however , adapt themselves to a larger variety of shapes than do natural straws . Among the ornaments used by the millinery industry are flowers , feathers , braids , ribbons , veils , and pins , and other decorative ornaments . Parisian Milliners The French modistes , as hat creators were called in Europe , realized long ago that a really chic hat is the result of imagination plus great skill in the manipulation of material and trim . An American designer who worked for many years with one of the French creators at Henri Bendel 's in New York City , tells that , no matter how closely the girls in the workroom watched the head designer making a hat , they could not duplicate the hat exactly . It was necessary , therefore , for the French woman to make all of the more costly hats . There are American milliners today , however , who have this same skill and artistry . Foremost among the celebrated French modistes before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Reboux , Marie Alphonsine , and Descat . Couturieres contributing hats especially designed to accompany their costumes included Srhiaparelli , Alix , Molyneux , Vionnet , Chanel , and Mainbocher . The dressmakers did not always promote their hat creations , as their organizations were set up to design and sell costumes rather than hats . New hat designs were shown by the great modistes several times a month while the costume houses of the couturieres showed new collections only four times yearly . The Selection of the Hal The selection of the correct hat depends upon a number of things : the occasion for which it is to be worn ; the features , hair arrangement , and personality of the wearer : the costume with which it is  | Hats are more than head coverings . They should be in character with the costume and occasion for which they are worn . Manipulated felt makes a flattering small hat for daytime wear while feathers are used for more dressy occasions . ( Both hats from Sally Victor , Inc. ) to be worn ; the geography ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . Although creative milliners are few , and their hats account for only a small percentage of the retail hat volume , their work is extremely important to the launching of new hat styles . Every hat selling for one dollar has been adapted from a high-priced hat that was presented some previous season . Until the recent war , Parisian modistes excelled in creating novel and distinctive styles . They presented new hat fashions weekly . So prolific were those designers that their new styles numbered in the thousands each year . Many of their hats were so extreme or bizarre that they were not popularly accepted and therefore were soon forgotten . Others , because of their becomingness , chic appearance , youthful effect , or practicality , have become classic and have remained popular for many years . Such a hat was the cloche . This deep-crowned , narrow-brimmed hat covered the head completely and was by far the most popular hat worn between 1926 and 1929 . This hat , accompanying a shawl-collared coat , was worn throughout America by women of all ages . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1930 's : the snap-brim , the turban , and the beret . These hat  | Hats may be selected to make the wearer appear older or younger as desired . Straight brimmed hats generally give a mature look while offthe-face hats are youthful . ( Both hats from Sally Victor , Inc. ) styles sold in all price ranges and in a wide variety of materials and colors. i The snap-brim hat is similar in shape to a man 's soft felt hat . The brim is finished without stitching or binding ; therefore it is easily adjusted to suit the wearer 's features . Likewise , the crown may be pinched or punched to balance a heavy nose or a thick chinline . This hat was introduced in the women 's field by M. Gaston de Clarville , formerly in charge of the Saks Fifth Avenue millinery department , and now associated with Tailored Woman Incorporated . M. de Clarville , in Paris on one of his many buying trips , attended one afternoon a picnic at a country place a short distance from the city . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain . In gallant fashion , he gave the girl his hat to cover her beautifully arranged curls . Enchanted Iy the effect of a man 's hat on a girl 's head , he at once conceived the idea of promoting this type in America . Retailing as high as $100 , the man 's felt hat was an instant success in New York City . The advertising agency promoting Canal cigarettes sensed the appeal of this hat , and photographed it in color for one of their national magazine advertisements . Throughout America retailers were soot . besieged by calls for the " Camel hat . "  | The hat , therefore , was made in lower-priced versions and began to sell in volume . It has remained popular for over a decade . It is the ideal hat for casual or country wear with tweeds or shirtwaist type dresses . In 1940 and 1941 it was made in cocoanut straw . The roller , similar to the snap-brim but always made with a round crown , is an ideal hat for children and girls and is excellent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been popular because it is flattering , practical , and suitable for most occasions and for wear with most of the costumes that have been popular during the last ten years . The turban , adapted from a man 's closely wrapped fabric headdress , originated in India where it was carefully and tightly adjusted around the head . While there is some sale in America for the turban wrapped by the customer when she puts it on , women prefer turbans that have already been draped and stitched and are thus always ready to wear . Lilly Dache revived the turban in 1937 , giving it again high fashion significance . It has always , however , been the older woman 's favorite . Carmen Miranda , the Brazilian singer , gave the turban great publicity by wearing it festively laden with flowers , fruits , and feathers . Society women like it for summer wear to cover a damp or disarranged coiffure . Like the snap-brim , it may be adjusted to suit the features of the wearer . The fabric of which it is made determines its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable for a gala evening banquet ; in silk jersey it is simple enough for utilitarian wear around the country or town . Although the turban is preferred by matrons , it is also being worn by younger girls . The more formal manipulated turban is called a toque . The beret is another hat borrowed from a man 's wardrobe . The Duke of Windsor , when he was the Prince of Wales , popularized the Basque beret ? a small , round , felt cap without a brim and finished with a small tail on top . Made in fabric in more elaborate versions , the beret is still popular with girls and women . The original Basque berets were worn at first by debutantes and young society matrons . Milliners were quick to see the possibilities of a more elaborate hat of this type , and soon made a beret-like hat in fabric , straw , felt , or leather . Because , like the snap-brim and the turban , it may be adjusted to suit the features of the wearer , it has maintained its popularity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vised to be worn on top of a pompadour ; and so we have the " pompadour-beret . " " Does the hat look suitable for the occasion ? " A carefully considered answer to that question is basic to the selection of the right hat . For general utility wear ? shopping , going on errands , traveling to and from the office at 8:30 in the morning and 6:00 at night ? the hat must not be too delicate in color , fabric , or design . Veils , flowers , and exotic shapes become sad and pathetic in a sudden rain . Extreme or new styles generally require a careful hair arrangement . The hat or hair arrangement should not require too much of one 's time and attention ; therefore this factor should be considered . Generally , a new coiffure requires careful attention for a few weeks until the hair becomes accustomed to being combed in the new direction . For afternoon , evening , or occasional wear , a hat may be more festive in color , design , or trim than for general utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of a shape that is more difficult to keep on the head . Dinner and theater hats should he fairly small , as well-annered women do not wish to annoy others . The Hat for Daytime Wear For many years the white hat was a leader for summer wear , but in 1940 cocoanut straws were introduced and became so popular that the white hat could no longer be considered the one outstanding summer hat . These cocoanut straws are made in tan colorings that look equally well with suitings , light spun rayons , or certain types of printed fabrics . A snap-brim felt may be desirable for a college girl , but it is too casual in character for the woman who wishes to make a good appearance at a business office in the city . There is no one general hat for daytime wear , however . The hat style , fabric , and color must be related to the rest of the wardrobe and the occasion for which it is to be worn . For daytime wear women 's and misses ' hats may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally trimmed with flowers , veils , feathers , or other ornaments , or with bandings of self material . They look appropriate for the costume frequently worn by the older woman . Generally the coat is of a solid , dark color , and is worn with a subdued print or solid-color dress . Bag , shoes , and jeweh s ' are also rather formal in character . A dressy hat is for occasional  | rather than for everyday wear and should be the second hat rather than the first selected when a customer buys a new hat wardrobe . Dressy hats may be quite simple but distinguished in line . It is this type of hat that the Parisian milliner made world-famous . Thinking particularly of the mature woman , these talented and skilled modistes devised lovely hats that have long been the delight of women the world over . The tailored hat may be either of straw , felt , or fabric , and is generally a sailor , or a pillbox , or some modification of the snap-brim . Simplicity in shape distinguishes the tailored hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress . For a girl who wishes to look older than she is in order to secure a coveted position , the tailored hat is usually a wise choice . Likewise , the too-glamorous or toobeautiful girl who wishes to enter such a profession as teaching , retailing , or stenography might well wear a tailored rather than a dressy hat to subdue her natural beauty . A famous coat designer , Mrs. Helen Cookman , makes this suggestion in regard to the selection of the hat : " With a coat or suit of distinctive cut , wear a plain tailored hat . If the coat or suit is severe , wear a dressy hat . Never combine an extreme coat or suit style with an extreme hat . One should be plain and undistinguished in order to emphasize the other . " The sports hat is generally a snap-brim or soft shape so that it may not be injured by being crushed . This hat best accompanies a tweed or tweed-type costume , the shirtwaist-type dress , sweaters and skirts , the reefer or princess coat , the short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a real utility hat and might well be selected as one choice to be worn throughout the life of a particular costume . Although the sports hat is more practical than the dressy hat , it may be very becoming , for today sports hats are available in many colors . Special Occasion Hats The traditional wedding veil is so precious that mothers save their own veils for their daughters ; and it is a proud girl who wears her grandmother 's veil for her own wedding . According to the Catholic religion , women and girls must have their heads covered in the church . The wearing of the bridal veil follows that tradition . Any arrangement of lace , tulle , net , or chiffon devised to flatter the bride  | is acceptable . Frequently flowers secure the veil in place on the hair . If a bride chooses to wear a suit or an afternoon dress , however , the hat should be colorful and flattering . It may be large or small , but must be in keeping with the formality of the wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilitarian purpose and may well be selected to be worn for several seasons . For horseback riding , a hat should keep the hair in place and give some protection from the sun and wind . The derby or bowler provides additional protection in cushioning the head in case of a fall . Street hats are not suitable for horseback riding . Snow sports , as tobogganing , skiing , and ice-skating require warm caps to cover the ears . These must fasten securely on the head . Crocheted or knitted woolen caps or hoods are available in gay colors and are warm , practical , and attractive . Beachwear also requires suitable headgear . The rays of the sun burn straw , and when this action combines with the action of the wind , sand , and salt water it is evident that a street hat would soon be ruined on a windy beach . Beach hats may be quite large and very gay in color and pattern . Hats that combine fabric with straw are generally the most practical , as a large straw hat is difficult to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands or ribbons . Bathing caps are now made with an eye for flattery and have some trim or decoration to eliminate the " boiled egg " appearance of the average girl in a plain , tight rubber cap . A colorful rayon scarf or kerchief , folded on the bias and tied over the cap , affords additional protection and is more flattering than the unadorned cap . For tennis or golf an adequate eye-shade is a necessity . All good players wear some sort of protection for the eyes , as the reflection of the sun is sometimes blinding . The white visor cap is an excellent choice for tennis , and a fabric or soft felt for golf is most satisfactory . The Relation of the Hat to the Costume The hat should harmonize in color , style , and material with the costume with which it is to be worn . As the occasion determines the choice of the costume , so it is a deciding factor in selecting the hat . All hats should be tried on to observe the effect on the full  | figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true of the hat that is to be worn with a suit . A hat worn with a coat is seen in its relation to the collar of the coat . A suit is more severe in line than a coat , however , and therefore more care is required in selecting an appropriate hat . From time to time fashion leaders introduce large hats to wear with street suits . Large hats accompany evening suits very well , and occasionally a large hat looks well with a dressmaker suit or a fussy silk suit ; but for wear with a strictly mantailored single- or double-breasted suit , a fairly small hat is generally desirable . A strictly tailored hat unrelieved with decoration or soft line , however , is generally too severe to look well with the severe lines of a man-tailored suit . The sailor with a veil or flower or feather trim , the small felt , the turban , the toque , pillbox , or beret are all good hat types to be worn with a suit . Mrs. Cookman 's rule holds true . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or flattering hat . With a plain hat , wear a dressier suit or coat . Hair Arrangement and Hats Which comes first , the chicken or the egg ? A similar question might be asked : Which comes first , the coiffure or the hat ? Shall you have your hairdresser devise a new way to wear your hair and then select the hat to go with it , or shall you select the hat and then have your hair styled to go with the hat ? Human hair being of variable quality , quantity , color , and texture , it seems wise to determine the arrangement of the hair first . In Paris , before the war , hair stylists were so numerous that every well-dressed woman had her hair arranged in various styles as a matter of course . New hats and new coiffures were presented weekly . Those coiffures that smart and well-known fashion leaders accepted set the trend , and the others were forgotten . This was true also of hat styles . Acceptance by the customer is necessary if a hat style is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order another like it for the next season , it is an assured style . The introduction of new hats and new coiffures , then , go hand in hand . The motion pictures give credit to the hair stylist as well as to the author , director , art director , milliner , gown designer , interior decorator , and photographer . These men are paid high salaries and are recognized as " artists " of great ability for their skill in devising hair arrangements for well-known and popular stars as they portray  | different characters . After studying the story and the period in which it is laid , the costumes to be worn , the texture and color of the star 's hair , her facial features and size , the hair stylist decides exactly what sort of coiffure will be most effective . The leading American hairdressers maintain their establishments because their skilled and professional workers know how to dress all kinds of hair . No one thing dates or types an individual so much as does a dated hair or hat style . Older persons complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubborn and shortsighted persistence in combing their hair in one way for ten or fifteen years may indicate their inability to accept new ideas and changes in business . The old-fashioned hair style identifies the individual with a closed mind . Such a person is rarely an asset in a business organization . Just as a certain style of hair arrangement can tie a person to the past , so a new coiffure and hat can identify one as being fashionable and up-to-date . The pompadour coiffure , introduced by Parisian stylists in 1939 , came to America at a time when all college girls were wearing their hair in the long , shoulder-length bob popularized by Greta Garbo a few years ago . At first students condemned this new arrangement of the hair , saying that it was not flattering , that it made one look older , was difficult to arrange , and would have to be set every night . The long bob and wavy , fluffy hair is attractive for many girls , but it is not the best hair arrangement for short , ( lark-complexioned girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their necks look shorter . It was those girls , therefore , who first tried the new hair arrangement , and soon the other girls were following their leadership . With the change in coiffure , hats became a little more formal in character . Snap-brim hats are not comfortable worn with a pompadour . Special Problems The most flattering hats are those that permit some slight adjust ment to conform to the wearers ' features . The snap-brim , beret , and turban may all be adjusted to suit the wearer . Other generally flattering hats are those that incorporate curved instead of straight lines . The hat that turns up on one side and down on the other is generally wearable . A medium brim that varies in width around the crown is flattering for more persons thin is the eery wile or  | very narrow brim . An adjustable crown likewise can be worn by many persons , as the slight change balances a heavy or a weak chin . The hats that are most difficult to wear are small tight hats , hats with sharp protruding angles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those small hats that require a perfect or well-arranged coiffure . Hats to make the wearer look younger The right colors , corset , costume , cosmetics , and coiffure banish age . When we acid the right hat to the list , we have the picture of a woman with the wisdom and patience of age and the charm of youth . Hats that defy age are the masterpieces of the milliner 's art . Seemingly simple , they are really skillfully and subtly designed , and just as subtly they give the wearer a psychological lift ? a lilt that is unmistakable . When Lady Mendel returned to America in 1940 she was honored by interior decorators , artists , merchants , and manufacturers . This venerable lady was then more than eighty years old , but she evidenced such vivacity and humor , and presented such sound ideas that no one could wonder at her half-century of influence in the decorating field . Lady Mendel 's hats are delightful , and she wears with distinction the type of clothes that women of thirty years of age wear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and subdued color combinations , are the devices employed in hats to give a youthful appearance . Veils are flattering , as are flowers , feathers , and jeweled or embroidered ornaments . The flattering materials , velvet , satin , fur , brocade , are all successful for the older woman . The hat that combines several colors , however , should be subdued . A gray-haired woman wears bright hats well . Red , orange-red , and fuchsia are all exceedingly flattering to gray hair . Hats to make the wearer look older Employers have a habit of wanting young workers who possess at least some of the sense of responsibility and the dignity that are attributes of age . Young people , therefore , are frequently refused positions because they look too young . The right hair arrangement and clothes will overcome this difficulty . Coiffures have been devised to make a young girl look older , among them the arrangement  | of the hair in curls or rolls on top of the head . A solid-color black hat with a slightly deeper crown than would ordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat , somewhat mature in silhouette , will also add age to the eighteen-year-old miss . Young men acquire dignity by wearing the gray homburg hat . A black homburg would look heavy and funereal , but the light color offsets the heavy look . Natural or achromatic colors such as gray , beige , taupe , and brown also contribute to the appearance of age . For the young person who is able to act older as well as look older , the reward is often the coveted position . Hats to make the wearer look taller The hat with brim , crown , or trim that carries the eye upward adds apparent height to an individual . This effect may be achieved by wearing a hat with a peaked or pointed crown , an upturned brim ? as in a breton hat ? flowers , feathers , or ribbons on the top of the hat , or with one side of the brim turned up . Halo and off-the-face hats also add height . The hat that shades the eyes , thus partially hiding the'face from the taller person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height more effectively than does a large one . Not all up-sweep hats are successful for the short person . For instance , the shako ? a plain , high-cuffed , brimless hat ? is too dramatic for the short person . No hat should be so overpowering as to appear to dominate the wearer . Hats for the tall person Hats with turned-down brims and with facing or trim on the lower side of the brim near the hairline are excellent for reducing the height of the too-tall girl . Decoration or lines of the hat should carry the eye across rather than up and away from the face . The heavy-looking hat is another good choice . This " heavy " look may be obtained by having the kettle edge or flange of the hat turned down . Veils also may be arranged to carry the eye to the face . Hats for the person with irregular features So many plain , ordinary-looking girls and women have been transformed by the selection of a new coiffure and a becoming hat that it is bard to believe any longer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an ugly face attractive and a fair  | face beautiful . Choosing the right hat for the face , however , demands that one know one 's best and one 's worst features and intelligently emphasize the good qualities and play down or conceal those that are less desirable . Sometimes the girl with irregular features finds that she looks well in a hat that is not harmonious with her height . In that case , it is best for her to choose the hat which flatters her face . Hats for the person with a thin face Some women have narrow faces although their bodies are short and fat . The person who feels that a narrow face is a handicap should add width to the head even though that procedure seems to contradict the rule for adding height . The dressier type of hat with side ornaments , irregular side brims , diagonal lines , and fluffy effects in feathers or flowers improve the appearance of the too-thin face . The straight sailor , the pillbox , and all angular hats , as well as skimpy , close-fitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be avoided are tailored and masculine-looking hats . Hats for the person with a round or full face Women and girls inclined to be stout usually have beautiful complexions , and this nice feature should be emphasized . More meticulous grooming of the hair , more care in the selection and application of make-up and in the choice of hats , are prices that the fat girl or woman must pay for her excess pounds . The coiffure should carry the eye up with curls or rolls of hair . The curls should be large enough to balance the features of the face . The hat should have a trim that gives the effect of height . Birds ' wings symbolizing flight are always successful on a hat for the heavy person , if the coiffure is suitable . Such a person should avoid the too-small hat , however , or the hat that looks too small for the rest of her figure . The too-large or extremely exotic hat , likewise , should be avoided . Color may be an interesting feature and a contrast of color is effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a brim or by a heavier crown . A narrow brim is a good choice for the person who is unhappy about wearing glasses . If a girl has a good complexion , her glasses need not detract from her appearance and she  | may wear off-the-face hats as she chooses . The girl with a small face looks best in off-the-face hats or hats with narrow brims . Glossary of Millinery Styles and Materials Hats are identified by both shape and fabric .

They serve both a functional and an aesthetic need . Shoes must be worn to protect the feet ; gloves are necessary to keep the hands dry and warm , and hats to shelter the head from sun , rain , and wind . Pins may fasten a neckline , scarf , or other part of a costume . A man 's scarf- or tiepin holds the tie in place . Aside from this functional use , accessories complete a costume . They center attention and may emphasize or detract from a pleasing or undesirable feature . Bright , decorative , and beautiful in design , accessories bring life and interest to an otherwise drab , dull , and tiresome costume . A change of shirt and tie gives an apparent change to the suit . A different hat changes the character of a coat .

In deciding on colors for the wardrobe it is an economical plan to keep in mind colors available in leathers .
