SCENE : The ground plan for the set of TOO MUCH BUSINESS is almost negligible . The play is set up to accommodate any kind of stage or platform or even the end of a hall . Much of the play is done before the curtain . For Manny 's office , supposedly back stage at the Palace Motion Picture Theater , Inc. , all that is necessary is a desk with chairs back and Right of it , a telephone on the desk . There are two entrances . They can be anywhere . For a more elaborate production Manny 's office may have the walls covered with pictures of film stars , a hall tree down stage Right , a sofa back stage Left , a water cooler and a filing cabinet . The illusion is that the theater in which the play is acted is the Palace Motion Picture Theater at 6:30 on a Saturday afternoon in any American city . The audience may either be invited to participate , in a curtain speech by the Director , before Mervin Dinkle 's appearance or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the idea all by themselves . It requires a few plants with lines . A production of the play at the University of Denver proved that the audience participates so much that only one or two plants are necessary to start the " We want the stage show " stomping here and there . DIRECTOR ( Appears before the Curtain ) Ladies and gentlemen ; in most plays you sit quietly in your seats and watch actors on the stage . This play tonight is different . You act in this one . I will now give you your part.You are to assume that this is the Palace Motion Picture Theater in any American City . The time is late Saturday afternoon . You are schoolboys and girls who want to see the stage show again . You 've seen the show three times already , but you want to see it again . The management has hundreds of adult patrons waiting outside . They want to get in and see the show . But they ca n't because you wo n't leave . The management is wild . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mervin Dinkle , will come out before this curtain and plead with you and perhaps insult you . You may interpret the part any way you see fit . If you think schoolboys and girls would insult him back  --  insult him . During the back stage scenes we ask you to be quiet . During the curtain scenes  --  be yourselves . Here comes Mervin Dinkle  --  remember  --  you 're the boys and girls  --  ( The DIRECTOR goes behind Curtain. ) p. 3 DINKLE ( Enters before the Curtain . MERVIN DINKLE is the Assistant Manager of the Palace Theater . He is a small man in a dark suit with a white carnation in his buttonhole . He wears shellrimmed glasses and at the moment he is very upset . He steps down close to the footlights and addresses the AUDIENCE . There is a faint SPOTLIGHT on him . Holds up his hands for quiet . His tone is one of desperate pleading ) Wo n't you please go home ? Go on , now , boys and girls , go on home . ( Adjusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows will start to move , you can all get out quietly without confusion . VOICE Yah  --  yah  --  you slug  --  go home yourself  --  DINKLE Now why wo n't you go home ?

VOICE For Santa Claus , you dope  --  bring on the stage show . DINKLE ( Trying to be firm ) We will not bring on the stageshow again ' til you get out of here . Oh  --  listen to me  --  be fair , boys and girls  --  be fair  --  Let 's have a square deal here .

DINKLE ( His voice rising ) You 've been sitting in this theater since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Just a minute , please  --  please , please , please  --  just a minute  --  There are four hundred people lined up outside at the box office waiting for seats  --  four hundred grown people who have n't seen the show . They have n't seen anything  --  Let 's give ' em a break , fellows . What do you say ? VOICE We say nuts to you , big boy  --  We want the stage show  --  we want the stage show  --  we want the stage show  --  ( Stomping of feet accompanies this chant . ) DINKLE I hear you yelling  --  " we want the stage show "  --  Of course you want to see the stage show again and hear the hot swing band  --  but , boys and girls , you 've heard it  --  The management of this moving picture house appreciates your patronage , but , boys and girls , the management of the house ca n't go on appreciating it all day  --  not when you got in this morning for a dime  --  and not when there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hear the hot swing band too  --  Is that nice  --  is that fair  --  is that a square deal ? p. 5 VOICE Ah  --  take a sneak up an alley  --  DINKLE ( Desperately trying another attack ) Listen  --  your mother wants you  --  your supper 's ready  --  it 's nearly bedtime  --  ( Crossly ) Oh , please go home and let somebody else have a seat . Give the other fellow a break . Be reasonable . Be American . VOICE Go soak your head  --  tell it to the Marines  --  yah  --  yah  --  yah  --  DINKLE So  --  ( Now angry )  --  you wo n't go . You think your dime entitles you to a half-interest in this picture house . All right  --  I 've tried to be fair and decent and reasonable  --  Well  --  that fair stuff is out  --  If you want to get tough  --  the management can get tough too . I 'm going to call Mr. Eiselbaum , the owner of the theater . ( He dives quickly behind Curtain. ) @x SCENE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palace Motion Picture Theater , backstage . There is a large desk Center with a telephone ; walls are covered with pictures of film stars . There is a filing cabinet and water cooler ; two or three straight business chairs , a swivel chair at the big desk ; a door back Center and another down Left which leads to the stage . AT RISE : MANNY EISELBAUM , a gentle-eyed man of about forty years wearing a fawn-colored vest and a brown fedora hat . He is smoking a cigar and walking back and forth across stage . A uniformed usher , BURT , is standing stage Left . The usher 's uniform looks like that of an Imperial Russian Guard . BURT acts like this too . Whenever he enters the office he does so with a march , comes to attention , clicks his heels and salutes MANNY  --  he also does this on leaving . MANNY 'S coat hangs on a hall tree near the door down Left . Whenever MANNY leaves the office he takes off the hat , hangs it on the hall tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he always removes the coat  --  hangs it up and puts on the hat . MANNY ( Turning . His manner at this point is serene , happy and confident ) Tell you what  --  get the gallery and the balcony full before you start shootin ' the customers into the downstairs seats  --  p. 7 BURT We ca n't move anybody in anywhere , Mr. Eiselbaum , till we get some seats . Those kids are in every seat in the house . MANNY ( Very offhand . He is not the least bit concerned ) Oh , that  --  Dinkle 's making ' em a speech right now before the curtain . They 're probably movin ' out this minnit . Dinkle can do it . He knows how . Smart fellow , that assistant manager of mine . ( DINKLE has entered from Left on the words  --  " He knows how  --  " DINKLE looks beaten and harried . He closes the door behind him . MANNY , turning , smiling ) Well , Dinkle  --  well , well , well  --  DINKLE ( Wearily , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done everything . I 've pleaded with them . Did you hear them hooting me ? ( Sinks into a chair ) They wo n't move from them seats . I 'm licked , I tell you . MANNY You mean the house is still full of them school kids ? They ai n't gone  --  they ai n't going ? DINKLE They ai n't gone  --  they ai n't going  --  they wo n't never go . Look at me , why do n't you ? I 'm all in . MANNY ( Glancing at BURT , he slaps DINKLE jovially on the back ) Listen to that , Burt . Look at me  --  how am I  --  well , Dinkle  --  why do n't you ask me how I am ? p. 8 DINKLE ( Wearily ) How are you , Mr. Eiselbaum ? MANNY ( Walking back and forth puffing the cigar ) Me  --  I feel swell  --  Look , let me tell you about me all over again . I hire the hottest swing in the country  --  costs me thirty-five hundred dollars for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of the best feature pictures  --  Myrna Loy , Clark Gable , Carol Lombard and Charlie McCarty  --  all on one bill . Today 's Saturday  --  should be our best day  --  and it is  --  I got four hundred customers lined up outside and fourteen hundred more coming . Business is good and I 'm not gon na let a little thing like a bunch of school kids spoil my day  --  ( Wheels suddenly around at DINKLE ) Well  --  you wanted to know about me  --  did n't you ? DINKLE Yes , Mr. Eiselbaum  --  ( His voice becomes faraway , reminiscent and resigned ) There 's a red-headed boy in the fourth row that has a false face . Every word I utter he makes that face go up and down  --  up and down  --  ( Illustrates with his jaw moving up and down ) I 'm goin ' nuts  --  MANNY ( Coming over and slapping him on the back ) Listen , Dinkle  --  you do n't get enough fresh air . ( Turns to BURT ) Awful high strung , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll get rid of them kids in no time , wo n't we , Burt ? p. 9 BURT I sure hope so , Mr. Eiselbaum . MANNY Sure  --  sure  --  we 'll get ' em outta here . Trouble with you , Dinkle , is you do n't understand children . Now , now  --  ( Claps him on back ) come on , snap out of it . Look at him , Burt , assistant manager of the Palace Motion Picture Theater Incorporated for six years  --  a good fellow , a goodlookin ' fellow and smart too , but he 's got an inferiority complex . He lets a bunch of school kids out there lick him . ( Pauses as he gets an idea ) School kids  --  Say , I got it . Let 's get the truant officers after ' em . Why ai n't they in school ? DINKLE It 's Saturday , Mr. Eiselbaum  --  there is n't any school . MANNY No school on Saturday ! Hey , Burt  --  ( Turns to BURT ) Is he givin ' me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eiselbaum . MANNY No wonder we got a depression . Look , Dinkle  --  I 'm a fair man , eh ? I been a good boss ? DINKLE Sure  --  Mr. Eiselbaum  --  you been a prince . MANNY I do n't know about that prince stuff  --  but I did n't work my way up from a popcorn peddler to let a theater full of school kids put me into nervous prostration . ( He goes over and tries to pull DINKLE up from chair ) Look , come on , Dinkle  --  we 'll snap into it  --  we 'll fix it  --  we 'll try again . p. 10 DINKLE I ca n't face it . I ca n't go out there again . If I lose my job for it I ca n't go out there again . They make a fool outta me , Mr. Eiselbaum . MANNY A fine way to talk  --  a fine , big , smart fellow like you , Mervin Dinkle , and little children can make a fool outta you . ( Sound of feet STOMPING on floor from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  BURT They 're gettin ' sore  --  they want the stage show . MANNY They got a fine right to get sore . They 've seen everything twice . They 'll pull the house down . Dinkle  --  get out there . ( Tries to pull him up again , but DINKLE is limp like a dish rag and sinks back into the seat . ) DINKLE I threatened them  --  I bullied them  --  I was fair with them and they yah-yahed me . MANNY ( Getting irritated ) All right , Dinkle  --  O.K.  --  O.K.  --  sit there and fade like a flower . You just watch your boss step out there and handle human nature . DINKLE There 's an awful lot of it out there to handle , Mr. Eiselbaum . ( TELEPHONE rings , and BURT answers it. ) p. 11 MANNY Do n't you worry none about me , Dinkle . I know how to get along with kids . Kid ' em along , wisecrack with ' em . They like it . I 'll have ' em eatin ' outta my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up phone ) It 's Miss Gordon in the box office , sir . She says we 've sold out the house . MANNY Sold out  --  That 's fine  --  good business . BURT Too good , Mr. Eiselbaum . The people are lined up for two blocks . They 're beginning to gripe . They want seats . MANNY Get out there and tell Miss Gordon she can promise seats to the customers in two minutes . BURT All right , Mr. Eiselbaum , and  --  MANNY What  --  what  --  hurry with it  --  I got a speech to make . BURT Mr. Lane in the projection room upstairs wants to know is the band comin ' on now or do you want him to run the newsreel over again ? MANNY Tell him to do nothin '  --  tell him to say nothin ' . Keep the house lights on  --  stop everything . Tell him this is a little somethin ' special  --  Then we shoot with the band in a few minutes  --  O.K.  --  O.K.  --  got it ? p. 12 BURT Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , then . ( BURT salutes , clicks heels and does an about face ; exits through the door Center . MANNY turns to DINKLE ) Just follow me into the wings , Dinkle , stand behind the curtain and watch me how I do it . Good experience for you . ( MANNY exits Left  --  first taking off hat and putting on coat . The sound of the STOMPING feet becomes louder . DINKLE stands looking in the direction of door Left and his face freezes . He shakes his fist . ) DINKLE You dirty little bunch of so and sos  --  you  --  ( Goes to telephone ) @x ( He steps into the faint light of a baby spotlight before the Curtain . He is grinning affably and determined to be jovial . MANNY figures this whole thing is really a big joke and that DINKLE was making a mountain out of a mole hill . Hands in his pockets , he beams at them ) Well , well  --  boys and girls  --  how are you ? VOICE Swell  --  how are you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of humor , all right . I like to see that . A little laugh never hurt no one , did it ? I guess I can take it . Listen , kids , here 's somethin ' I want to get across to you . Did you kids ever stop to think that a man  --  for instance  --  like me  --  for instance  --  is nothing but a kid  --  like you  --  for instance  --  grown up ? VOICE ( Very slurred and insolent ) So-o  --  o  --  wh-a-t  --  fat boy ? ANOTHER VOICE You grew , all right  --  VOICE Give ' em a cheer , fellas  --  Let 's go  --  ( Stomping of feet ) Look at the fat boy  --  look at the fat boy  --  look at the fat boy  --  MANNY ( When they finally stop ) Look , kids  --  do I look like a bad guy ? p. 14 VOICE You do n't look good , brother . MANNY Do I look like a mean man ? VOICE You 're no Clark Gable . MANNY Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look like the kind of guy to pull a dirty trick on a bunch of swell kids ? VOICE Cut it out , fatty  --  you 're breaking my heart  --  boo  --  hoo  --  hoo  --  ( OTHERS take up the chorus of boo-hoo 's . ) MANNY ( Still trying  --  forcing another grin ) I like kids . Say listen , you fellows out there , I got me a winter home out in San Diego  --  a nice place with lots of lawn and grass and I got me a swimmin ' pool and a tennis court and croquet grounds and here 's somethin ' else . I know you 're gettin ' ready for a wisecrack , but wait a minute , will ya ? Any time any of you kids are out in San Diego you just come right up to Manny Eiselbaum 's house and we 'll take you right in and treat you right . Now , ai n't that nice ? VOICE How do we know ? ANOTHER VOICE Go on back to San Diego  --  take a sneak up an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you 're gon na keep it up . You do n't care . You 're gon na ruin me and my business . Listen  --  ai n't you ashamed ? You been in them seats since the Palace Motion Picture Theater opened this morning at eleven o'clock . You 've seen the pictures three times and the stage show twice . What about those people out there standin ' on their feet in line waitin ' to get in ? Maybe you think it 's fun to stand in line ! Where 's your heart ? They 're grownups , sure , but do n't you think grownups get sore feet ? p. 15 VOICE Let ' em sit down  --  let ' em lie down  --  ANOTHER VOICE Let ' em take their shoes off  --  MANNY ( Even more angry ) I 'm disgusted , that 's what I am . Nobody coulda shot straighter with you than what I shoot . You came in here early this mornin ' and brought your lunch . You sat right in them especially upholstered fine leather seats and you guzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peelings and orange peelings on my fine broadloom carpets . ( Shakes his fist at them ) You do n't dare do that at home  --  if you got a home  --  or your Dad would turn you over his knee and spank you , if you got a Dad  --  VOICE Go lay an egg  --  fat boy  --  All aboard for San Diego  --  We want the stage show  --  We want the stage show  --  MANNY ( Is hit in the face with an orange peel just as he is about to duck behind the Curtain . He turns back angrily , takes a pencil and pad out of his coat and looks sternly at the AUDIENCE ) All right , smarty . I seen who done that  --  see  --  ( Holds up pad ) and I 'm makin ' a note of it . I 'm gon na check up on a kid like that comin ' in here and destroyin ' property and heavin ' a orange peel at the manager  --  You 'll see  --  ( Sticks his tongue at them and ducks quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MANNY comes through door Left , his fists clenched and his face white with anger . DINKLE , who is standing at desk , comes over to him . ) DINKLE Say , Boss  --  MANNY ( Gritting his teeth ) Wait  --  DINKLE But , Boss  --  MANNY Do n't say nothin '  --  ( His eyes are closed and his voice is hoarse . ) DINKLE ( Coming close to him and touching him timidly on the shoulder ) Mr. Eiselbaum  --  MANNY ( Breathing hard ) Hold onto me , Dinkle . That 's right  --  grab me  --  ( DINKLE timidly takes hold of one of MANNY 'S arms . ) Tighter  --  ( He yells this ) Do n't let me make a move . Put both of your hands on both of my shoulders . DINKLE ( Doing it fearfully and lightly ) Like this ? MANNY Yeah  --  yeah  --  you got me ? DINKLE I think so , Mr. Eiselbaum. p. 17 MANNY Then keep me  --  keep holdin ' me  --  we 'll stand just like this  --  ( They stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then MANNY speaks in a low tone ) One of ' em had the gall to throw an orange peel at me . I 'd like to blow the place up  --  I 'd like to  --  Keep hangin ' onto me , Dinkle  --  ( He breathes more easily and says ) That 's all right . I feel better now . ( Walks away a few paces ) You got ta see the funny side of it , Dinkle . DINKLE I guess so , Boss . MANNY I suppose there 's people in the world who would sit down and laugh theirselves sick at a thing like this  --  ( Sits back of desk . ) DINKLE ( His tone is doubtful ) Maybe there are , Boss . MANNY Even if  --  even if  --  they 'd put up thirty-five hundred bucks for a hot swing band . Yeah  --  ( Quietly ) Maybe there are people like that  --  ( Jumps from seat and bellows at DINKLE ) but I 'm not one of ' em  --  see ? DINKLE Boss  --  I wanted to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tell me  --  p. 18 DINKLE Mr. Eiselbaum , while you were out there I took the liberty of calling the police  --  MANNY The police  --  the police  --  sure  --  My God  --  why did n't we think of that before ?

Let ' em try to hit the cops with orange peels . Oh , boy  --  do I feel better quick  --  do I feel better already ! ( BURT enters Center . He does the march , gives the salute and stands at attention down Right . ) Well , well  --  BURT Mr. Eiselbaum  --  MANNY Yeah  --  yeah  --  BURT Mr. Lane in the projection room wants to know do you want him to shoot the newsreel ? MANNY Tell him to hold everything just one minute  --  BURT And Miss Gordon in the box office says fifty people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to salve ' em up a bit . Tell ' em they can have seats in a minute . The law is on the way over here now . Things are about to happen  --  got it  --  p. 19 BURT Yes , Mr. Eiselbaum . MANNY Get goin ' with it , then ! BURT ( As he salutes and goes to exit Left  --  he returns , or rather , pops back in immediately ) Mr. Eiselbaum , there 's a cop out here askin ' for you  --  MANNY Thank God ! Kiss him and send him in  --  BURT What ? What did you say , Mr. Eiselbaum ? MANNY Send him in  --  send him in  --  ( Enter a POLICE SERGEANT Left .

DINKLE Please , Sergeant  --  we got this hot swing band and two big features . The school kids always come to the show on Saturday  --  they get in at eleven in the morning  --  and they often bring their lunch  --  SERGEANT You do n't say . This certainly interests the Police Department . Come on  --  come on  --  where does the law come in ?

MANNY ( Lifting head from phone ) Five hundred customers outside . p. 21 SERGEANT Make up your mind  --  DINKLE If you do n't run these kids outta here for us , Mr. Eiselbaum is ruined , and if he 's ruined I lose my job , and if I lose my job I 'll get the hell kicked outta me when I get home . SERGEANT These kids buy their tickets ? MANNY Yeah .

Dinkle , it 's just by the grace of God , I can see it now  --  that I did n't do somethin ' terrible in my life somewhere and end up in the gas chamber at the state penitentiary . A man never knows what he 's made of till he 's right up against life like this . ( PHONE has rung on " Man never knows what he 's made of  --  " ) DINKLE ( On phone ) Who  --  who wants to see me downstairs ? Mrs. Withrow wants to talk to me about educational films .

For instance  --  ( MANNY prepares himself to listen. ) each child carries his or her own plate and cup and saucer and knife and fork and spoon to the table . Mr. Withrow and I do the same  --  he leading , I following . After the meal is eaten , each one carries the dirty dishes back to the kitchen and each one washes his own utensils with his own dishcloth and dries them with his own dishtowel  --  hanging his or her own tea towel on a special hook in the kitchen over which we have the individual colors  --  ( Points with forefinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANNY and DINKLE follow the movements of her finger with their eyes . ) Red , white , green , yellow , orange and pink  --  My nail is the pink one . It 's my favorite color  --  p. 27 DINKLE Does n't that make it pretty crowded out there in the kitchen ? All of you moppin ' up at the same time  --  MANNY That 's just what I was thinkin ' , Dinkle . MRS . WITHROW Not crowded  --  co-operative . You see , Mr. Eiselbaum  --  the psychology ? MANNY ( Relaxed and tired and reminiscent for a moment ) Well  --  I du n no  --  DINKLE There 's a lot more to raisin ' a family than you have any idea , Boss  --  MANNY Oh , I du n no . You take some of the oldfashioned ideas and they were pretty good too . Kids raise hell all the time today on this newfangled psychology and they should be gettin ' their pants kicked . Now you take my mother  --  I got the finest mother ever a man had  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten in our family , but none of us ever put anything over on Ma . Oh , she was swell  --  sweet as a peach when you watched your p 's and q 's  --  but just let you step outta line  --  ( Directs this toward MRS . WITHROW with gestures . She recoils. ) and you 'd get a slap in the jaw that ud knock you downstairs . Oh , I du n no  --  They do n't come any better , though . She lives right down town here at the Crestmore Hotel . You ought a stop in and visit her some time , Mrs. Withrow . I go to see her every Sunday afternoon . Eighty-one years old and everything she 's got 's just as good as it ever was  --  eyesight , teeth , hearing . My God , Mrs. Withrow  --  do you want to know something  --  p. 28 MRS . WITHROW ( Doubtfully ) Why , yes , of course . MANNY Right today  --  mind you  --  right today  --  Mama 's got more teeth than I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points ) I got six lowers and about ten uppers  --  not countin ' this bridge  --  DINKLE ( Breaking in ) What you say is a fact , Boss  --  Now my mother never laid a hand on us . But my old man  --  we never fooled with him  --  MANNY ( Relaxed in memories of the past for a moment ) Sure  --  sure  --  DINKLE When Pop yelled we stepped  --  all except my brother Ed  --  He never could do nothin ' with Ed . Ed 'd step right up to Pop ( Goes toward MRS . WITHROW ) and take the razor strop right out of his hand and stand there and laugh . " I 'm sixteen years old , Pop "  --  I can still hear him sayin ' it  --  " and you 're not workin ' me over no more . " Lots of spunk in Ed  --  tough as they make ' em .

WITHROW Corporal punishment is pass  --  definitely pass  --  what with the progress of child psychology in the last thirty years  --  ( There comes the sound of feet STOMPING from outside . MANNY is awakened from his reminiscence . ) MANNY My God , Dinkle  --  what are you doin '  --  standin ' here gassin ' about your old man when we got trouble on our hands . Mrs. Withrow , you get them kids outta the theater and there 's a season pass for you and your old man and your four kids , and you can even wash your cups and saucers in the drinkin ' fountain down in the main lobby . MRS . WITHROW I 'm sure that 's very nice . I flatter myself that I 've always gotten on with children . I taught for fifteen years . You see , Mr. Eiselbaum  --  unless you can control yourself you ca n't control them  --  and they know  --  oh  --  how they know ! They can look right through you and see if you can control yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WITHROW comes out before the Curtain  --  adjusts her neckpiece and beams all around . She coughs a little to clear her throat  --  puts on her glasses and pulls at her briefcase . ) MRS . WITHROW Although many of you may know me by face if not by name , for the benefit of those who do n't I 'll introduce myself . I 'm Mrs. Augusta P. Withrow , President of the Past President 's Council . VOICE Hi  --  ya  --  Babe  --  MRS . WITHROW ( With dignity ) Good afternoon . That voice seemed to come ( Points ) from right about there . I ca n't see your face , but evidently we know each other . So I 'll say  --  " Good afternoon " to you . Now  --  the management of this picture house has asked me to say a few words to you , but before I go into that I want to take a few minutes to say something about the work of our council . I do n't know how familiar you are with this work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that we have had the most successful year since our inception and that our treasury fund is in better condition than  --  ( Looks through notes ) What have I done with the treasury  --  Oh , here it is . Is in better condition than at any time since we became affiliated with the national organization . I would like to say a word or two about our milk and cracker work . Here are the figures . More than five hundred children , per week  --  per district  --  have been given crackers and milk during the morning sessions and in some districts once during the afternoon sessions , making a total  --  of  --  ( During MRS . WITHROW 'S talk above the AUDIENCE has been quiet vocally but busy otherwise in throwing paper wads at her . She brushes them off mechanically ) Hmm  --  moths  --  Now , as I was saying  --  p. 31 ( MANNY steps out from behind the Curtain to remind her that she is not to give a club report but to get the kids out of the theater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the kids see MANNY ) There 's the fat boy  --  Hiya  --  fatty  --  Hiya  --  slug  --  yah  --  yah  --  ( MANNY dives back behind the Curtain and MRS . WITHROW changes her attack . ) MRS . WITHROW The council feels that  --  ( Weakly ) Well  --  children  --  ca n't you find anything better to do on a beautiful Saturday afternoon but sit in a stuffy movie house  --  ca n't you ? The council , under the supervision of our recreation chairman , Laura Maxwell McGinnis , has provided hockey balls and tennis racquets for all the municipal parks . Why ca n't you go on over to the parks and play with the hockey balls and tennis racquets ? Well  --  why on earth  --  do n't you go  --  go on  --  I 'm waiting  --  ( There is only another barrage of paper balls in answer . ) Well  --  I 'm sure I 've pointed out everything I can point out  --  I thank you .

She has left her fur piece and pocket book on MANNY 'S desk . She is flurried and nervous . MANNY and DINKLE are silent . ) MRS . WITHROW I ca n't understand it , Mr. Eiselbaum . They are not in the least bit co-operative  --  ( MANNY does n't answer . He stands and stares at her . DINKLE hands her the purse and neckpiece . ) It seems that when you get a crowd of them together they do n't react the way they react in smaller groups , do they ? ( MANNY and DINKLE shake their heads silently at her . They do not speak . She goes to door Left and then turns ) Mr. Eiselbaum and Mr. Dinkle  --  would you mind keeping this quiet ? It would seriously affect my standing with the council if they knew that  --  well , if they knew I 'd had that kind of experience out there before that curtain . You wo n't mention it , will you ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door for her . She exits . PHONE rings . DINKLE gets it . ) DINKLE ( On phone ) Yeah  --  yeah  --  All right , I 'll tell him . Boss , those kids in the gallery  --  they 're still raisin ' Ned  --  and your wife is on her way up here . p. 33 MANNY I 'll go up to the gallery , Dinkle  --  ( Gets up to go toward Center door ) You better string along with me , Dinkle . It 's not safe for me to be alone right now . DINKLE Sure , Boss  --  ( They go out Center door , closing it behind them . Just after their exit the door Left opens and in comes MANNY 'S wife  --  ANNA EISELBAUM , her friend , ESSIE WETZEL , and a BOY about twelve years old , ESSIE 'S son . The BOY is scrubbed and wears a green beret and tweed shorts . He looks sullen and discontented . ) ANNA See , Essie  --  this is Manny 's private office . Oh  --  Manny ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back in a minute . ( Sits back of desk . ) ( The BOY has knocked down a picture off the wall .

BOY Aw , lay off  --  ESSIE Fool around till you break somethin ' and I got ta pay for it  --  You satisfied now ? ANNA Oh , Essie  --  leave the kid alone .

This is Mrs. Eiselbaum . Is Mr. Eiselbaum down there ? Thanks . ( She hangs up ) He 's in the gallery . He 'll be here in a minute .

Come on , Sonny  --  BOY ( As she pulls at him ) Aw , whatsa idea ? ESSIE You heard me . Another crack outta you and I 'll take you back to the hotel and leave you there . BOY Aw , who cares ?

( ANNA , hearing footsteps outside , hides behind the filing case up Right Center . ) ( Enter MANNY , Left , followed by BURT . MANNY moves over to his chair Left of desk and sinks wearily into it  --  cupping his chin in his palm ) p. 36 BURT ( Approaching him after a second ) Say , Boss  --  ( MANNY looks up at him sadly without answering . ) I got an idea  --  MANNY ( Weakly ) Give  --  BURT How about havin ' the orchestra play " Home Sweet Home " and swing it  --  Maybe that 'll make ' em leave  --  ( Stands waiting .

ANNA tiptoes quietly out from behind the filing case , comes over to MANNY and coyly puts her hands over his eyes . ) MANNY ( Turns , looks up and says sadly  --  first heaving a deep sigh ) Hello , baby  --  ANNA Hello , sweet ! Surprised to see me ? MANNY No , baby  --  nothin ' surprises me. p. 37 ANNA I did n't think I 'd come downtown today , honey  --  but I changed my mind . How do you feel ?

You 're just as tempermental as an opera star . I always said it was too bad you could n't sing . MANNY ( Roaring and pounding the desk ) What was you gon na tell me , sweetheart ? ANNA Honey  --  you remember Essie Wetzel ? MANNY Sure  --  sure  --  skinny little dame  --  with a mean tongue on her . ANNA Shh  --  shh  --  Essie and Irv stood up for us when we was married and then they moved up to Pocatello , Idaho .

Essie 's an awful good old friend .

Huh  --  Manny  --  ( MANNY has gone absentminded . He is grinning in a sickly fashion . ) Manny  --  Manny  --  Essie ai n't changed a bit , has she ?

He eats bananas and scatters them all over the carpets  --  he gets bread crumbs in the upholstery that costs five bucks a yard wholesale  --  he drinks milk and spills it all over and he even takes a nap . He keeps grown people that work hard for their money all week long from comin ' in and gettin ' a seat  --  people that get their weekly happiness out of a Saturday night movie . He loses money for the house  --  he drives the owner crazy  --  he even goes down to the washrooms and stuffs paper down the sinks just for the helluvit  --  for a lousy dime he gets two bucks worth of entertainment , and when the house asks him to leave in the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange peels at him .

Somebody ought to take every kid in the world and take ' em out to the middle of the ocean and drown ' em all and drown ' em good . ANNA Manny Eiselbaum , you 're comin ' with me to a doctor . MANNY ( Now going full force and clenching his fists ) Get me the marines  --  get me an army of big slugs that'ud go out there and beat the pulp outta them . Anna , this stuff you hear about kids is a lie  --  a kid is a fiend . The only mean people in the world is kids . I wo n't feel good till I kill a couple  --  ANNA Manny , you wait right here  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talk to nobody . I 'll get rid of Essie and be right back .

MANNY All right , baby  --  all right  --  ANNA ( At Center door ) But the only decent thing to do now is to give Essie and the boy a couple of seats to the show .

There ai n't no seats . p. 46 ANNA All right  --  Manny  --  all right  --  do n't move till I get back . ( Exits Center . ) DINKLE ( Enters Left . The STOMPING begins .

Come on  --  ( Takes his hand ) Try it  --  hard  --  harder  --  harder . ( MANNY has DINKLE by the hand . They stomp , stomp , stomp across the stage , DINKLE finally getting into the spirit of it . They exchange glances with each other , DINKLE trying to talk to him now and then .

DINKLE I been over talkin ' to Joe and the boys  --  I got ' em out here . MANNY Bring ' em in  --  ( Sighs deeply and takes a checkbook out of his pocket . DINKLE goes to Left door and opens it . Enter JOE POPOPULOS , a dark , thuggish looking man with a cap in his hand , followed by three other dark , equally thuggish-looking men in sweaters . MANNY looks at them sadly as they go to Left ) Hello , Joe ! Dinkle here told you what this was all about ? ( JOE looks around at the BOYS and nods . They nod silently at him and he turns and nods to MANNY . ) Think you can handle it ? JOE ( Goes over and whispers with the BOYS and then comes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANNY About twelve hundred  --  do n't you think , Dinkle ? DINKLE Twelve hundred easy  --  JOE ( Turning to BOYS ) Twelve hundred easy , he says . ( The BOYS put their heads together a minute to digest this news . Then one of them takes a step forward and wiggles a forefinger at JOE , who steps over to them and they ALL whisper a minute and then JOE steps back to MANNY ) Awful short notice for twelve hundred . MANNY ( Impatiently ) Can you handle it  --  or ca n't you ? JOE ( Goes over for another huddle with the BOYS and then comes back ) We 'll do it  --  MANNY I been holdin ' back as long as I can  --  but I got to ask it sometime . How much will this cost ? JOE ( Quickly ) Two hundred bucks  --  ( Looks at the BOYS for the approval . They ALL nod . ) MANNY Two hundred ? JOE Two hundred . MANNY I 'll do it  --  I got ta do it  --  How long will it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference , returns and says ) Start ' em over in five minutes . We 'll keep the line movin ' . But for that price you ca n't expect the best grade of stuff or the best delivery . We 're only human  --  eh , boys ? ( BOYS nod . ) MANNY You 're entitled to your own opinion on that . ( Gets up ) O.K.  --  Joe  --  O.K.  --  get goin '  --  get started . I 'll have Dinkle send out the word  --  or wait a minute  --  Hey , Dinkle  --  maybe this wo n't move ' em . Have you thought of that ? DINKLE I 'll bet it will , but I ca n't be sure  --  MANNY No use puttin ' out dough till we 're sure . ( To JOE ) Tell you what . I 'll step out there before the curtain and tell ' em and if they start to move I 'll yell you a signal back here . Joe and you and the boys can beat it across the street and get ready  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's so hard about it ? ( Winks at his pals and they wink back . ) MANNY All right  --  you wait here and I 'll go on out and speak to ' em  --  the little thievin ' no good so and so 's  --  I 'll tell ' em so , too  --  p. 50 DINKLE Easy , Boss ! They all got parents and their parents all come to the shows full price . MANNY The kind of parents those hyenas has got could only get into a Zoo  --  You 're a smart boy , Dinkle . I should forget my pride and remember business is business . Maybe it 's cheap at that .
