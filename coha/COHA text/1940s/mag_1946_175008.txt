The railway strike was broken . Before he went to Capitol Hill to ask , dramatically , for his strikebreaking measures , Harry Truman was reasonably sure that he had won the railway war . But the baffling civil war was not won . There was still John Lewis , glowering on the left flank-or was it the right flank ? Joe Curran , clearly on the red left , threatened to tie up merchant shipping on June 15 by calling out the maritime unions . <P> Harry Truman could not stand much more of the kind of humiliation he had suffered at the hands of Lewis and the brotherhoods ' Alexander Whitney and Alvanley Johnston . The nation 's economy could not stand many more such paralyzing strikes . Harry Truman and Congress had let things drift so far that there was nothing to do but drop a legislative atomic bomb . <P> A little more than 100 minutes after he spoke to a joint session of Congress ( see below ) , the House wildly debated and overwhelmingly passed ( 306-to-13 ) Mr. Truman 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <P> If the President decides it is " vitally necessary to the maintenance of the national economy " to keep any strife-harassed industry running , he could proclaim a national emergency , give both sides 48 hours to end the lockout or strike , order labor leaders to send their men back to work . <P> Spasms of Rage . Failure on the part of employers or labor bosses to comply with these orders would mean up to $5,000 in fines , up to one year imprisonment , or both . Workers who failed to go back immediately would lose their jobs and all their seniority rights . And if they balked as long as 24 hours they could be drafted into the Army . All net profits made under Government operation would go into the U.S. Treasury . Harry Truman , well aware of the scope of the bill , carefully put a limit on it : six months after the officially proclaimed end of the war . <P> The bill might have been law before John Lewis went to bed that night if various Senators , for various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , with tempers somewhat cooled , the Senate considered it . In advance of debate , many Senators , both Democratic and Republican , were opposed-especially to the draft provisions . <P> Many in the nation had second thoughts . Union labor , as expected , erupted in violent outbursts . Joe Curran vowed he would strike anyway ; other unionists used their angriest epithet- " strikebreaker " - against the President . <P> Would the law , if passed , stop strikes ? The Smith-Connally Act , also passed in a spasm of congressional rage , had simply multiplied and complicated the very troubles it sought to cure . <P> The new stopgap legislation raised profound moral questions . Thoughtful citizens , well aware of the crisis , and generally applauding the President , would nevertheless wonder afterwards about the ethics of such atomic legislation . <P> Mr. Truman had not won the war . He had merely won a battle . The U.S. still had a rendezvous with the labor question .                  @ @ @
