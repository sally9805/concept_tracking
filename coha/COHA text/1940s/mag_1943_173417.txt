With small ceremony , the U.S. Army Engineers celebrated completion of the biggest job in their blueprints since the Panama Canal . Last week the last link in the Akan Highway was made ready for traffic . " The Road " was finally open : a two-way military highway which is the first all-year land connection of Alaska to Canada and the U.S. <P> When the speeches flowered at the formal dedication last November , The Road was hardly more than a slot in the trees . But while it was still a rough scratch on the earth the Alcan Highway somehow became a smooth fact in the pub lic mind . Travel-starved citizens dreamed of the day when they , too , might wheel the family sedan through Dawson Creek and Whitehorse , past Kluane Lake and Tanana ( pronounced Ta'na naw ) Crossing . <P> 1,630 Miles , One Town . Actually , few stay-at-homes could visualize the immense and harsh reality of The Road : some 1 , 600 miles from end-of-steel at Dawson Creek in British Columbia to end-of-steel at Fairbanks , Alaska , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote that it boasts only one settlement big enough to be called a town . <P> While the Alcan is officially " The Alaska Highway , " it carries only war traffic . It was built , not for the vacation trade , but to service and supply the chain of airports strung along the air route which it follows . <P> No tourist turnpike , it is 26 ft. wide , has not a mile of hard surface . Its graveled length and incongruously urban bridges serve only military necessity . <P> The Road 's cost seems high for what Sunday drivers ' maps would call a " secondary road . " It will total around $125,000,000-some $75,000 a mile for road built . But this price-the approximate price of a battleship-looked less steep when the Japs were in the Aleutians and the sea routes to Alaska were menaced . <P> To the Army , the Alcan was a vital line of defense . <P> New Route . As events have fallen , The Road gets its finishing touches in time to serve as a memorial of its own necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt water opposite Skagway to a junction with the Alcan , 1 08 miles west of Whitehorse . <P> The new Haines cutoff was slammed through the wilds this year , now carries some truck traffic . Scheduled to be finished before freeze-up this fall , it shortens the truck haul to Fairbanks by a thousand miles , supplements existing rail and water routes to the interior . <P> With the sea lanes to southern Alaskan ports open the year round , the southern half of The Road may not see much through traffic . Greyhound busses , operated for the Northwest Service Command , now run the thousand miles from Dawson Creek to Whitehorse , average 22 m.p.h . Trucks will continue to supply the big airport at Watson Lake , even with the pipeline punched through from Whitehorse-location of the refinery for oil from Norman Wells ( TIME , Oct. 4 ) . But no postwar commercial or tourist development now in sight will justify maintenance of this stretch of The Road .                 @ @ @ @
