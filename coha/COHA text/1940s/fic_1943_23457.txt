HEROD CONSIDERS THE MASSACRE OF THE INNOCENTS W. H. AUDEN This is a passage from , a Christmas oratorio entitled " For the Time Being " on which Mr. Auden has been working . Herod is speaking.  - -  - The Editors ECAUSE I am bewildered , because I must decide , because my decision must be in conformity with Nature and Necessity , let me honor those through whom my nature is by necessity what it is . To Fortune that I have become Tetrarch , that I have escaped assassination , that at sixty my head is clear and my digestion sound . To my father  --  for the means to gratify my love of travel and study . To my mother  --  for a straight nose . To Eva , my colored nurse  --  for regular habits . To my brother , Sandy , who married a trapeze artist and died of drink  --  for so refuting the position of the Hedonists . To Mr. Stewart , nicknamed The Carp , who instructed me in the elements of geometry through which I came to perceive the errors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures on the Peloponnesian War . To the stranger on the boat to Sicily  --  for recommending to me Brown on Resolution . To my secretary , Miss Button  --  for admitting that my speeches were inaudible . There is no visible disorder . No crime  --  what could be more innocent than the birth of an artisan 's child ? To-day has been one of those perfect winter days , cold , brilliant , and utterly still , when the bark of a shepherd 's dog carries for miles , and the great wild mountains come up quite close to the city walls , and the mind feels intensely awake , and this evening as I stand at this window high up in the citadel there is nothing in the whole magnificent panorama of plain and mountains to indicate that the Empire is threatened by a danger more dreadful than any invasion of Tartars on racing camels or conspiracy of the Praetorian Guard . Barges are unloading soil fertilizer at the river wharves . Soft drinks and sandwiches may be had in the inns at reasonable prices . Allotment gardening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight up over the mountains and the truck drivers no longer carry gun . Things are beginning to take shape . It is a long time since anyone stole the park benches or murdered the swans . There are children in this province who have never seen a louse , shopkeepers who have never handled a counterfeit coin , women of forty who have never hidden in a ditch except for fun . Yes , in twenty years I have managed to do a little . Not enough of course . There are villages only a few miles from here where they still believe in witches . There is n't a single town where a good bookshop would pay . One could count on the fingers of one hand the people capable of solving the problem of Achilles and the Tortoise . Still it is a beginning . In twenty years the darkness has been pushed back a few inches . And what , after all , is the whole Empire , with its few thousand square miles on which it is possible to lead the Rational Life , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbaric night that surround it on all sides , that incoherent wilderness of rage and terror , where Mongolian idiots are regarded as sacred and mothers who give birth to twins are instantly put to death , where malaria is treated by yelling , where warriors of superb courage obey the commands of hysterical female impersonators , where the best cuts of meat are reserved for the dead , where , if a white blackbird has been seen , no more work may be done that day , where it is firmly believed that the world was created by a giant with three heads or that the motions of the stars are controlled from the liver of a rogue elephant ? Yet even inside this little civilized patch itself , where , at the cost of heaven knows how much grief and bloodshed , it has been made unnecessary for anyone over the age of twelve to believe in fairies or that First Causes reside in mortal and finite objects , so many are still homesick for that disorder wherein every passion formerly enjoyed a frantic license . Caesar flies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Capital , Society grows savage , corrupted by silks and scents , softened by sugar and hot water , made insolent by theaters and attractive slaves ; and everywhere , including this province , new prophets spring up every day to sound the old barbaric note . / have tried everything . I have prohibited the sale of crystals and ouija boards ; I have slapped a heavy tax on playing cards ; the courts are empowered to sentence alchemists to hard labor in the mines ; it is a statutory offense to turn tables or feel bumps . But nothing is really effective . How can I expect the masses to be sensible when , for instance , to my certain knowledge , the captain of my own guard wears an amulet against the Evil Eye , and the richest merchant in the city consults a medium over every important transaction ? Legislation is helpless against the wild prayer of longing that rises , day in , day out , from all these households under my protection : " 0 God , put away justice and truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Eternity would bore us dreadfully . Leave Thy heavens and come down to our earth of waterclocks and hedges . Become our uncle . Look after Baby , amuse Grandfather , escort Madam to the opera , help Willy with his homework , introduce Muriel to a handsome naval officer . Be interesting and weak like us , and we will love you as we love ourselves . " Reason is helpless , and now even the Poetic Compromise no longer works , all those lovely fairy tales in which Zeus , disguising himself as a swan or a bull or a shower of rain or what-have-you , lay with some beautiful woman and begot a hero . For the Public has grown too sophisticated . Under all the charming metaphors and symbols , it detects the stern command " Be and act heroically " ; behind the myth of divine origin it senses the real human excellence that is a reproach to its own baseness . So , with a bellow of rage , it kicks Poetry downstairs and sends for Prophecy . " Your sister has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as like me as possible . What use to me is a God whose divinity consists in doing difficult things that I can not do or saying clever things that I can not understand ? The God I want and intend to get must be someone I can recognize immediately without having to wait and see what he says or does . There must be nothing in the least extraordinary about him . Produce him at once , please . I 'm sick of waiting . " To-day , apparently , judging by the trio who came to see me this morning with an ecstatic grin on their scholarly faces , the job has been done . " God has been born , " they cried , " we have seen him ourselves . The World is saved . Nothing else matters . " One need n't be much of a psychologist to realize that if this rumor is not stamped out now , in a few years it is capable of diseasing the whole Empire , and one does n't have to be a prophet to predict the consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead of Rational Law , objective truths perceptible to any who will undergo the necessary intellectual discipline , and the same for all , Knowledge will degenerate into a riot of subjective visions  --  feelings in the solar plexus induced by undernourishment , angelic images generated by fevers or drugs , dream warnings inspired by the sound of falling water . Whole cosmogonies will be created out of some forgotten personal resentment , complete epics written in private languages , the daubs of school children ranked above the greatest masterpieces . Idealism will be replaced by Materialism . Priapus will only have to move to a good address and call himself Eros to become the darling of middle-aged women . Life after death will be an eternal dinner party where all the guests are twenty years old . Diverted from its normal and wholesome outlet in patriotism and civic or family pride , the need of the materialistic Masses for some visible Idol to worship will be driven into totally unsocial channels where no education can reach it . Divine honors will be paid to silver teapots , shallow depressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ruined windmills , even in extreme cases , which will become increasingly common , to headaches , or malignant tumors , or four o'clock in the afternoon . Justice will be replaced by Pity as the cardinal human virtue , and all fear of retribution will vanish . Every corner-boy will congratulate himself : " I 'm such a sinner that God had to come down in person to save me . I must be a devil of a fellow . " Every crook will argue : " I like committing crimes . God likes forgiving them . Really the world is admirably arranged . " And the ambition of every young cop will be to secure a deathbed repentance . The New Aristocracy will consist exclusively of hermits , bums , and permanent invalids . The Rough Diamond , the Consumptive Whore , the bandit who is good to his mother , the epileptic girl who has a way with animals will be the heroes and heroines of the New Tragedy when the general , the statesman , and the philosopher have become the butt of every farce and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Civilization must be saved even if this means sending for the military , as I suppose it does . How dreary . Why is it that in the end civilization always has to call in these professional tidiers to whom it is all one whether it be Pythagoras or a homicidal lunatic that they are instructed to exterminate ? Oh dear ! Why could n't this wretched infant be born somewhere else ? Why ca n't people be sensible . I do n't want to be horrid . Why ca n't they see that the notion of a finite God is absurd ? Because it is . And suppose , just for the sake of argument , that it is n't , that this story is true , that this child is in some inexplicable manner both God and Man , that he grows up , lives , and dies , without committing a single sin . Would that make life any better ? On the contrary it would make it far , far worse . For it could only mean this : that once having shown them how , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lead a sinless life in the flesh and on earth . Then indeed would the human race be plunged into madness and despair . And for me personally at this moment it would mean that God had given me the power to destroy Himself . I refuse to be taken in . He could not play such a horrible practical joke . Why should He dislike me so ? I 've worked like a slave . Ask anyone you like . I read all official dispatches without skipping . I 've taken elocution lessons . I 've hardly ever taken bribes . How dare He allow me to decide ? I 've tried to be good . I brush my teeth every night . I have n't had sex for a month . I object . I 'm a liberal . I want everyone to be happy . I wish I had never been born .
