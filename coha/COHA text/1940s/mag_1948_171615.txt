To look at Eugene Berman , a bald , plump , cheerful little man , you would never guess that his paintings are meticulously composed glimpses of ruin , misery and decay . A Thomas Traddles among painters , he pictures philosophers asleep under Paris bridges and ragged princes mooning among the ruins of their family palaces ; his work fairly groans with heartache . But Berman himself , whose painted gloom has earned him a solid reputation throughout Europe , has claimed to be " divinely happy " ( " It 's just that I enjoy melancholy things ! " ) . <P> Last week a Manhattan gallery exhibited Berman 's latest paintings . They showed a striking new power . He had been to Mexico , and the visit had inspired the best work of his career . <P> That career has run against the current of modern art . The stepson of a rich St. Petersburg banker , Berman was left homeless at 18 by the Russian Revolution . Settling in Paris , he was enchanted by the " Blue Period " paintings of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By that time , restless " Papa " Picasso was gaining notoriety as a cubist ; but Berman , along with his brother Lonid , and his friends Tchelitchew and Brard , thought cubism something to keep clear of . Their idea was to go on from where Picasso 's Blue Period left off-to paint , in a traditional way , the cracked shells of European civilization . They were the " Neo-Romantics . " <P> In 1935 , Berman came to the U.S. For a while he painted murals for fashionable houses , covers for Vogue and Town &; Country He settled in Hollywood , " the way New York artists go to Connecticut . It 's a quiet life , very few people . " But he seemed to yearn for the tragic actors and the monumental stage sets of Renaissance Europe . He began to produce ever larger , ever emptier pictures of a girl with her back turned ( she might have been his own Muse ) . At last , as if his pictures were decaying with his talent , he gave his canvases a moldy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> In Mexico Berman made a rapid recovery . He went down on a Guggenheim Fellowship , carrying a Brownie , and returned with a suitcase full of snapshots to use for filling in the details of his imaginary compositions . He found the life of the Indians , in rags beneath their ancient monuments , as moving and vivid as his gloomiest dream . " There 's always some disaster , " he says happily . " They spend half their lives in the fields and on the roads-without an auto , without a Frigidaire . The bareness is what appeals to me. "
