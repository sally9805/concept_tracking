Where was Adolf Hitler ? He had not been seen or heard since July 21 . Last week for the first time ever , he failed to address the Reich on the anniversary of his Munich Beer Hall Putsch . <P> Rumor swirled across Europe : Hitler was in the latter phases of paranoia . He had been seriously injured in last summer 's bomb plot . He had been partially paralyzed by an apoplectic stroke . He had undergone a throat operation . He was under the care of four doctors , including a brain specialist . On his physician 's advice , he had retired to Berchtesgaden . He had been deposed by Gestapoboss Heinrich Himmler . He was simply keeping out of sight so as not to associate himself in the minds of Germans with the days of defeat . He was dead . <P> Then it was announced that four days after the beer-hall anniversary Hitler would speak . Everybody waited . The German radio broadcast a proclamation purporting to have been written by Hitler : " Requirements of total war have caused me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters does not permit me to leave it , not even for a few days . ... I consider my task today to consist not ... in delivering speeches . . . . " But Hitler 's proclamation was read by Himmler . <P> Where was . Adolf Hitler ?
