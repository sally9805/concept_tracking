How well can Russia take advantage of her size ? Can she survive if European Russia is lost ? These were questions that puzzled observers last week , as Russia fought desperately on her western borders . <P> Withdrawing into the vastness of Asia is no new idea to Russian officials . Since 1928 , chief trend of the three Five-Year Plans has been to open up Siberia and the East . Designated for years as Russia 's " Chungking " has been Sverdlovsk , 950 miles east of Moscow in the Urals . <P> &gt; Job of the first Plan was to build a base of heavy industry far from dangerous European borders . Around the biggest coal deposit in the world , in the Kuznetsk Basin in mid-Siberia , mines were opened , steel mills built . The huge magnetic iron-ore mountain at Magnitogorsk in the Urals got other mills . A tractor and rifle factory went up at Chelyabinsk near by . <P> &gt; The second Plan opened new mines and industries , with ports in the Arctic at the mouth of the Lena and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed as far east as Lake Baikal , new oil fields opened in the Urals . Most railroad construction under the Plans was in the East , and as population followed production , agriculture and food industries followed too . <P> &gt; One purpose of the Plans was defensive - to shift Russia 's center of gravity to the hinterland-and official statistics now put 33% of Russia 's coal , power , iron , 80% of her copper production east of the Urals . But how well the Five-Year Plans have succeeded otherwise no one outside of Russia and few inside know . Doubtless the center of gravity has not yet shifted as far as Russian leaders wish . <P> &gt; Should the Germans reach the Volga , Russia would lose 75% of her man power , two-thirds of her coal , iron and steel , most of her oil . Resistance then , even with a moderately intact Army , would be physically very difficult and perhaps politically impossible . <P> &gt; Biggest single difficulty of a Russian Government pushed east of Moscow would be transportation . There are virtually no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both are single-tracked . Only major transportation line through most of Siberia is the east-west Trans-Siberian Railway . Even if all existing industry ran full time at full capacity , few could see how Russia would run an industrial economy and fight a modern war , with such transportation .
