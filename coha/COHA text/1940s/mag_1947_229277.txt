The Letter Man Morris Kantor is one of the select group of artists whose pictures hang in all three big Manhattan museums : the conservative Metropolitan , the middle-minded Whitney , and the freewheeling , streamlined Museum of Modern Art . These diverse honors make Kantor a three-letter man in U.S. painting , but not necessarily an All-American ; they are as much a tribute to the diversity as to the quality of his art . <P> Excepting Picasso , who is the end-all of most switches and surprises in modern art , few can touch Kantor for variety . A mild , quiet little man whose long face is made even longer by his swooping nose and luxuriantly sad mustache , Kantor changes his style with his subjects . Last week at a Manhattan gallery he seemed to be trying two at once . Half the paintings on show were piney , briny souvenirs of Kantor 's summers at Monhegan , Me . They looked a little as though they had been pasted together with pine needles and pitch . The other half , not so successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gilded and decorously draped with penciled nets . <P> Gallerygoers noted Kantor 's never-failing subtlety of color and texture , his sculpturesque use of form , but most of them preferred the more simply enjoyable Cape Cod sand dunes , big trees and haunted houses of previous Kantor phases . <P> Kantor has had time for half a dozen such phases ; he was born half a century ago , in Minsk , Russia . Young Kantor imagined the U.S. as a land of opportunity for his art , but when the hopeful 13-year-old stepped off the boat , Manhattan 's teeming garment district swiftly swallowed him up . It took him seven years to get as far as art school . Since then he has gone all the way from pure abstractionism to meticulous realism ( and most of the way back again ) . His theory : " Each painting should stand by itself , not only as to subject matter but also technically . Variety is the basis of all living force . " <P> Today Kantor is one of the most popular teachers at Manhattan 's Cooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his students is that , unlike their own , Kantor 's perennial experiments are usually successful . " It is n't easy , you know , " explains Artist Kantor shyly . " Painting is rather like having a love affair . "
