The Dimensions of the War <P> THE MAKING OF TOMORROW-Raoul de Roussy de Sales - Reynal &; Hitchcock ( $3 ) . <P> This book about the issues of World War II offers no solutions , draws few conclusions , tells nobody who has thought about the subject at all any fact that he did not know before . Nevertheless , it is one of the important books about World War II . Reason : it brings into the open some of the fears that are secretly gnawing at democratic minds . Its method is that of the doctor who tries to make a mental patient cure himself by laying bare the hidden causes of his psychosis . Its therapeutic value is great , for the democracies are bedeviled by fear . <P> It is not primarily the military strength of the Axis that the democracies fear-it is the moral strength . It is not their own eventual war potential that the democracies question-it is the ability of democracy to survive as a political system . What the democracies really fear is that Naziism ( and Communism too ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is young and they are old , that it is the future and they are the past . Concealed , this fear secretly saps democratic morale . This doubt also reinforces other cognate doubts-bewilderment at the mixed character of World War II ( here a national war , here a social revolution , here a colonial revolt ) ; bewilderment at the failure of the religious and moral standards by which nations have lived ; bewilderment at the carelessness with which the masses seem ready to trade in hard-won political freedom for economic security ; a feeling that we have known all along that this would happen , but , like King Lear in the storm , understanding beggary for the first time , " have taken too little care of this . " <P> Century of Despair . The democratic sense of moral guilt ( which Author de Sales discusses at some length ) long antedates Hitler and his fifth column . Books are an index to a civilization 's moral health , and for the last hundred years most of the world 's great books have been despairing indictments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every quarter of Europe a series of secular seers warned civilized men that civilization was dying of social septicemia . In Norway , Ibsen indicted modern society , in a series of dramas whose strict respect for the dramatic unities ( the thing that impressed the critics ) was symbolic of the cold rigor of his rage . In Russia , Tolstoy , having incomparably described the society he repudiated , then repudiated his own writings as a symptom of that society . In England , Alfred Lord Tennyson was obsessed all his life by the disintegration of 19th-Century civilization , which he dressed up for poetic purposes in Arthurian armor . Though he tried to trust the larger hope , he could never quite blind himself to visions of a startling realism : <P> The fortress crashes from on high , <P> The brute earth lightens to the sky , <P> And the great Aeon sinks in blood .
