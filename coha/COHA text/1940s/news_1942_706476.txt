txt One Group Found Neglected On Dec. 7 last , when the Japanese attacked the United States forces at Hawaii , about the only governmental agency functioning 100 per cent in war effort was the Selective Service Administration . Composed mostly of volunteer , nonpaid workers ( some 3,500 in New York City alone ) who for the last eighteen months have been sacrificing family comforts and business time , the draft system has accomplished everything asked for . Nothing it was given to do was put " on order . " Every new requirement imposed on the system was carried out with expert promptness . No uniforms , no high-power press releases , no praise from any source is given this unselfish group of citizens . In the forthcoming " New York at War " parade it seems that everybody who has jumped on the band wagon since Pearl Harbor has been invited to participate  --  but not those who were making sacrifices when sacrifice was not yet popular , the local board groups .
