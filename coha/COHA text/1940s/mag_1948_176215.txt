A rumor spread that the Russians had ordered railway employees to stand by for reopening of the line from Helmstedt to Berlin . The German supervisor of the line denied it . Another rumor had it that the Russians were beefing up their defenses in front of Germany 's western zones . All semblance of four-power control of Berlin had ended on July i ; the Russians finished the obsequies last week by hauling down their flag from the Kommandatura building , removing Uncle Joe Stalin 's picture and withdrawing their sentry . <P> TIME 'S Berlin Bureau Chief Emmet Hughes cabled : " The notable mark of Russian conduct here is that in no respect has it been tempered by the talks in Moscow . While Western officials feel bound these days to move warily on such issues as the currency crisis , lest the Moscow talks be prejudiced in the slightest way , the Russians plainly feel no such restraint . <P> " Without respite , the Soviet offensive has been carried on . Berlin has two currencies , two food administrations , two trade unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anything from tax revenues to arrested criminals , Berlin is now two cities . " <P> Time for a Protest . For a fortnight the city 's two police forces had been seizing vehicles from each other . Last week the Communist police chief sued to recover an automobile which , he said , the West Berlin police chief had wrongfully impounded . Germans noted the disappearance of several men who worked on the West Berlin force but lived in the Soviet sector . The Red cops raided black marketeers near the sector line , and when some of the fleeing Germans scrambled across it , the police followed . West Berlin police and Allied MPs appeared and ordered the invaders back ; they complied , but the Red press screamed that the Western powers were " harboring " criminal fugitives . <P> Two squadrons of Yak fighters droned over the city in formation , scaring Berliners . The four powers had agreed that there would be no formation flying over Berlin or over the Western air corridors . At the four-power Air Safety Center , the lone Russian official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his watch , silently handed a paper to a U.S. captain sitting nearby , and resumed his reading . The paper was another protest against alleged U.S. flight violations . <P> Fifty Days . On Friday the 13th , Berlin had weathered 50 days of siege . The stormiest wind and rain of the year whipped through the ruined city . Nevertheless , on that day the West 's cargo planes flew in more than 2,000 tons. * At Tempelhof , a C-54 winged in &; out of the overcast with a load of coal , overshot the field , crashed a fence , burst into flame . The two U.S. flyers got out safely through an emergency hatch-leaving the airlift 's death toll still at five . <P> Throngs of women and children brought gifts-carved jade , Meissen chinaware , jeweled watches-to their heroes , the Anglo-U.S. airmen . Some 1,300 German laborers , of whom 75% were women , started work on a new airport in the city 's French sector ( see cut ) . Said Christian Democrat Leader Jakob Kaiser : " Fifty days of blockade have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a foreign will has been transformed into democracy 's greatest victory in Germany since the war . " <P> <P> * The previous day a record 4,700 tons was brought in.
