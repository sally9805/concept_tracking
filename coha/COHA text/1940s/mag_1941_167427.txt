Only rugged , cheerful , clean-cut , abstemious young men in pluperfect health need apply . Those are the boys the U.S. Army wants for its fliers . And then what happens ? After these super men fly a few years , some of them become irritable , neurotic , deaf , with stomach trouble , nightmares , high blood pressure , liable to die several years before their time from heart disease . Such a dismaying picture of fliers ' occupational diseases might be put together from the solid medical handbook for fliers published last week by famed Army Flight Surgeons Malcolm Cummings Grow and Harry George Armstrong ( Fit to Fly-Appleton-Century ; $2.50 ) . <P> But the book also contains much useful information on how to avoid just such a dismal outcome . <P> Although 27 is the upper age limit for new Army fliers , the doctors claim that " the older a pilot gets the safer he becomes , up to about the age of 38 , and that he then maintains that degree of safety as long as he maintains the required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> During swift turns and pullouts from dives , pilots can not avoid momentary blackout-loss of consciousness-because blood rushes from the head . Small , heavy-set pilots are more resistant to blackout than tall , slender men , and those leading a sedentary life have more resistance than men in athletic training . Men with high blood pressure are less affected by dives . <P> In most planes , control handles and numerals on instruments are covered with radium paint for visibility in darkness . " This radium paint gives off emanations which are absorbed by the body and , in large enough doses , can cause radium poisoning . " Such poisoning , say the doctors , is unlikely . " There is some danger , however , of flakes of the radium paint on the control handles sticking to the hands and later being transferred to the mouth . " Preventive : all control handles should have their radium paint covered with a coat of shellac or varnish . <P> A frequent cause of accidents is altitude sickness . Most fliers still believe that their altitude tolerance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not collapse . Actually , oxygen should be taken as low as 10,000 ft . A complete lack of oxygen , for only one minute , say the doctors , may destroy irreplaceable brain cells , produce tiny hemorrhages , degeneration of the adrenal glands . <P> Parachute jumping " has no effect on either the body or mind . . . and falling free ... is not a harrowing experience . " ( Captain Armstrong should know , for he has jumped as a medical experiment . ) " Until one gets very close to the earth there is no sensation of falling . One feels as though he were simply suspended in space . As one gets close to the earth , however , and the eyes are able to detect the shortening of the distance between the body and the earth , the sensation of falling appears . "
