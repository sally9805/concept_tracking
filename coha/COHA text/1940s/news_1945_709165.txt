txt No one need be much concerned when Senator William Langer of North Dakota says that UNO is " a production of pure bunk . " Mr. Langer was one of two Senators who voted against the ratification of the Charter . In and out of the Senate he is in this respect one of a small and lonesome minority . But he did manage to get into the Thursday debate over confirmation of the President 's nominees to the UNO Council a covering clause borrowed from some UNO critics who profess to be international idealists . He said he was in favor of a world organization . He just happened not to be in favor of the only world organization that now exists or has any immediate chance of existing . We may let Senator Langer go his way . He is no menace . But we can not feel quite as easy in our minds over those who set up to be warm friends of international cooperation  --  and indeed , in all sincerity , may be such  --  but have turned their guns on UNO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are dissatisfied because the great Powers have too much authority . Some of them will be content with nothing less than the abolition of national sovereignty and the establishment of a world State . Both these points have a superficial validity . A world completely dominated by three great Powers would be a world ruled by a minority . A limitation of sovereignty is essential to peace . Nations must once and for all surrender the right to make aggressive war . They must agree to specific ways of settling disputes . In the long evolution of history we must look forward to their becoming less and less significant as political entities , more and more significant as cultural units . The question is not whether or not these developments are desirable . It is whether or not we are willing to accept what we can get now and work patiently for the rest . Suppose we do not accept what we can get now . Suppose we dismiss UNO as " phony " or use some longer and more beautiful expression for rejecting it . The immediate alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a return to the old balance-of-power system , with alliances , secret understandings , the marshaling of forces and , finally , another war . World War III might produce a perfect , even a Utopian peace among the communities and peoples that chanced to survive it . In the ruins men might grow suddenly wise . But do we want to get our Utopia in this fashion ? The man in the street , the parents in the home , the children who will in a few years be of military age , would , be likely to say no ? if anyone asked them . UNO actually exists . It has a frame of government . It has already set up a number of cooperative agencies . Next month its Assembly will hold its first meeting . The avowed object of this meeting , as of UNO itself , is to " maintain international peace and security . " It is no secret that there are differences among the great Powers , and also between many of the smaller nations and the great Powers , as to precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months since peace came there has been the usual post-war quarreling , sometimes open , sometimes more or less concealed , among the partners in the victorious war . All has not been smooth sailing in the Preparatory Commission . Not all will be smooth sailing in the Assembly . There are grave issues to be settled . But UNO is a means for settling these issues peaceably and with an increment of good-will . There comes a time in history when dreams and inspirations will not serve , and when the only relief for humanity 's sorrows lies in inexhaustible patience , in coming again and again to the conference table and the parliamentary forum until agreement can be had , in the painful sweat of mental effort . The United States is sufficiently detached from selfish interest in land or resources , in pride or power , to bring these qualities to the London meat of UNO . And every one who for al reason , even the most exalted reasc interferes with this contribution is d ing this country  --  and humanity gridvous harm .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
