txt President Truman offered today the vision of a great network of river control projects but declared its realization would demand " the toughest kind of fight " against private interests and their friends in Congress . Hewing again to the issue of public versus private power projects , the Chief Executive used phrases reminiscent of the late Franklin D. Roosevelt . And for the second time in two days he invoked the name of his predecessor on his side of the issue . The " men of little faith , " the " private power lobby " all were denounced as opponents of projects which would enrich all the West . Continuing his sharp assaults on Congress , President Truman earlier told a throng of about 5,000 persons at Bremerton that it was " interested in the welfare of the better classes . " Reply to Southerners Seen . And again the chief executive reiterated that he had been misrepresented - and that he had come out to let the people see what he was like . Mr. Truman has been pressing this theme stronger and stronger as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is believed he is serving notice on all in his party that he is the titular leader and that he means to remain " the boss . " It is interpreted aboard his train as the answer to those Southern Demo , crats and some others who would like to draft Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower at the Democratic convention next month . The President follows up the argument by saying that he wants to come back later in the year to talk I politics on a full basis . The reason for Mr. Truman 's increasingly bitter attacks on Congress , it was learned from a source close to the President , is that it is making an impression on . the party workers he is meeting cin his speaking trip . They think the attack is good tactics . Also , the tour , once officially referred to as " non-political , " has roused the spirit of the Democratic organizations now that it has developed into a slugging match . According to the same source , the attacks on Congress are regarded as effective because the Republicans are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seattle , a major policy address , broadcast nationally , was made before a crowd of about 6,000 persons in a stadium with a capacity for 12,000 . It was his third full-dress speech , with prepared text , which he has made on his tour . He spoke in the Memorial High School Stadium under the auspices of the Washington State Press Club . While Mr. Truman 's audience only half-filled the stadium , President Truman got a New York-type welcome in downtown Seattle from scores of thousands of persons . Ticker tape and confetti rained down from windows in a thick storm . In some streets loud speakers were set up so that the speech was heard by a larger audience than Mr. Truman faced in the stadium . It was estimated that 50,000 alone packed the downtown " canyon " of four blocks . Division Police Chief P. D. Botson said that , altogether , about 100,000 persons were in the streets , the largest crowd he had seen in thirty years . Dudley Brown , president of the Washington State Press Club , said the meeting had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ordered a change of setting to the stadium . The President came here from Olympia this morning . With him Was his close friend , Gov . Mon C. Wallgren , who got on the Presidential train at Spokane and accompanied the President here . The train passed through Seattle last night and went on to Olympia , where Mr. and Mrs. Truman and their daughter , Margaret , were guests of the Governor in the Governor 's mansion . Then they came back to Seattle this morning , but on a fisheries yacht , to emphasize Seattle 's importance as a port . Governor Wallgren is regarded as a possible VicePresidential running mate for Mr. Truman . The President was also accompanied by Senator Warren C. Magnuson , one of his strong supporters on Capitol Hill . Power Company Attacked Mr. Truman called in his Seattle speech for a great upsurge of public opinion to sweep out the power group he was attacking . Getting down to cases , he declared all of northern California had been compelled to resort to a " brownout " because Congress had acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of a private company . " He also asserted this company had failed to provide adequate power to avert the brownout . It was reported on the President 's train that he was referring to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company , of San Francisco . The President also referred disparagingly to the Aluminum Company of America . He said that " Old Man Davis " Arthur V. Davis has been leader of the company for many years had come to him early in the war ana told him the country 's aluminum capacity would not exceed 300,000,000 pounds . Now the country was producing far more than that and still it was not enough , he added . As in all of Mr. Truman 's prepared speeches , his rhetoric was more restrained and formal than in the extemporaneous talks in which he has been berating Congress . But he made up in the broad scope of his attack for the softer style of a prepared speech . High Water Seen From Train Referring to the flood waters he had seen from his train along the Columbia River yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be controlled . Then he outlined his vision of a system comprising a mighty project to harness the drainage of the Columbia in seven states , He said that the Missouri , the Colorado and the Central Valley of California should be mastered . All of these systems should be inter-related with each other for power and irrigation , he continued . He also said that they should be related to the development Of fisheries and forests and of other rittural resources . " It will take the toughest kind of fight to put over these great projects for Western development , " Mr. Truman declared . " For there are people in this country who will not support the adequate development ' of Western resources . benefits of Dams Stressed In describing great benefits from the Grand Coulee and Bonneville projects , Mr. Truman declared that the cries c ? " the private power lobby " that they would prove " white elephants " had " proved to - be absurd . " Mr. Truman said that the House last year cut his appropriation request of 448,000,000 for reclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Congress seemed disinclined to go so far , " but I have a suspicion that this might have something to do with the fact that this is 1948 . " The Bremerton crowd , packing a main cross-thoroughfare , was with the President . They gave him a hearty reception and , when he took the upper-classes dig at Congress , a man shouted : " Pour it on , Harry . " " I 'm going to , I 'm going to , " the 17resident exclaimed , with obvious feeling . " You know , this Congress is interested in the welfare of the better classes , " the President asserted . " They are not interested in the welfare of the common , everyday man . They said if we lifted price controls , and things of that sort , business would take care of prices . " Well , business has taken care of prices for the welfare and the benefit of the fellow at the top . The poor man is having to pay out all his money for rent and for clothing and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I said in Butte the other night , " the President said , pressing his attack , " if this Congress adjourns before it has done something about prices , and something about the welfare of the laboring man , and something about housing , it would be a disgrace to this country . " I want to bring that home to you strongly in every place I can , for the simple reason that this Congress is going to adjourn pretty soon . They are going down to Philadelphia in a few days and are going to tell you what a great Congress they have been . " Well , if you believe that , you are bigger suckers than I think you are . " I have taken this tour over the country here to let you know what I am trying to Co as President of the ' United States . I have been so hopelessly misrepresented on various matters that I thought I had better come out and let you look at me to see whether I am the kind of fellow they say I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics really begin to boil , you can make up your minds as to Whether you had a President the last three years or not . The country is running , the country is prosperous , and everybody is happy except for one thing , and that is the way that the price spiral has been going up . If they had carried out all the recommendations which I made to the Congress , we would have had control of that , too . " Mr. Truman told the Bremerton audience that he was " very happy this morning to find that the truce had been signed between the Arabs and the Jews in Palestine . " " That is a victory for the United Nations , " he added . " And it is also a victory for the ' United Nations when they signed a truce in the East Indies  --  in Indonesia . We must just keep working at this thing until we get the peace implemented . "                    @
