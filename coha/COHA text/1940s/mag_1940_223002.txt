Fire last week destroyed a new addition to the building where the U. S. Army has its Washington headquarters . Officers looking for the cause guessed at everything from cigaret butts on awnings to saboteurs . Wags had another theory : sparks , set a-flying when somebody mentioned Captain Melvin Maynard Johnson Jr . <P> Captain ( Marine Corps Reserve ) Johnson is a tall , gun-happy young Bostonian who invented a semi-automatic rifle , then outraged the Ordnance Department by insisting out loud that his weapon was better than the Army 's Garand rifle ( TIME , April 8 ) . The Army arsenal at Springfield , Mass. , after many bumbles , last week had Garand production up to 2,300 per week . After a year of agonized effort to tool up for the complex Garand , Winchester Repeating Arms Co. at last was almost ready to begin quantity production . But Ordnance officers were still unhappy about Melvin Johnson and all his works , including his latest : a 14-lb. ( when loaded ; 12-lb. empty ) , super-simple , one-man machine gun . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine gun , up to last week had neither offered nor been asked to test the new Johnson . Having been told ( unofficially , but unmistakably ) that he could never do business with the U. S. Army , Inventor Johnson perforce took his deadly darlings to foreign buyers . <P> Last week he had two customers : the Netherlands East Indies and China . This information was divulged by the U. S. <P> State Department , which also indicated its own interest in a deal that would help arm these countries against Japanese invasion . <P> Happy Mr. Johnson lined up a contractor ( Universal Winding Co. in Rhode Island ) to manufacture both guns in quantity . <P> At that point a monkey wrench-apparently flung from the general direction of the Army Ordnance-clunked into the works . The astonished State Department was informed that the War Department disapproved of this deal on two grounds : 1 ) machine tools needed to make Johnson guns could better be used to make weapons on order for the Army , 2 ) the Johnson designs , although unwanted by the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to friendly powers . Military brasswigs had neither forgotten nor forgiven Inventor Johnson 's original sin .
