txt El Axis Purges As Allies Drive On Last week was a black week for the Axis . Hard-hit on their fighting fronts , both Germany and Japan suddenly faced crisis within Their strategy failing , the Allied threats mounting , the Axis partners executed drastic changes of leadership . In Germany another purge was on . The long-predicted split between the cold - minded professional generals of the Prussian school and the fanatics of the Nazi party appeared to have come . Hitler said his opponents had tried to kill him ; a bomb explosion in his headquarters was the signal for a " cleansing " of the High Command , the elevation of Gestapo chief Heinrich Himmler to complete control of the home armies . There were reports of mutiny . Alfred Rosenberg , Nazi leader , said the " fifth front " had been opened . His statement pointed up the dangers to Hitler on the four military fronts : the iron ring was closing . In the east the Russians were rolling toward the Reich at an almost headlong pace . From the Baltic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , the Red Army was driving the Wehrmacht before it . In the west the Allies in Normandy , on the front which Nazi spokesmen had saie was the " focal point " of danger , had broken out of the Norman peniiisul , onto the plains and were threatening to split Hitler 's defenses in western France . In the south the Allied armies were giving the Wehrmacht no rest as it sought to make a new stand across Italy ; fluid attack threatened to pierce or flank static defense . In the air  --  the fourth front  --  Allied airpower was hitting Nazi Europe almost at will , shattering factories and communications ; even the Germans said that Munich , cradle of the Nazi party , was now ' ' only a memory . " In the Far East At the eastern end of the Axis ? in Japan  --  the conquest of Saipan , defeats on other fronts , the growing menace to the Japanese homeland brought the ousting of the whole Imperial Cabinet , headed byPremier Hidekei Tajo . " Using all means available , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " able to achieve its objectives . " The Emperor was concerned ; a new Cabinet would try to strengthen Japan . Even as this Cabinet was being formed a new blow fell . The Americans landed on Guam , first American territory to be taken by Japan , a big stake in the war in the Pacific . In these developments at both ends of the Axis the forces of aggression seemed to have come full circle . Setting out to divide the spoils of the world , they had counted on quick sweeps , on crippling blows that would leave them safe from counter-attack . As long as victories could be counted there was no trouble at home . Now that defeats were the steady fare , there were doubts about the men who had promised so much . The shadows were falling the other way , darkening both Berlin and Tokyo . Hitler vs . Generals In the summer of 1918 Germany was beaten at the front and the German generals called on the civil government to make peace . Thereafter the generals  --  and later Adolf Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lost because of the failure of the home front . Last week there were indications that again important Junker generals had come to the conclusion that Germany had been beaten in the field and that out of defeat they ought now to salvage what they could , with an eye presumably to World War III . This time they faced . instead of a free and compliant Government , Adolf Hitler  --  and Hitler must fight to the end . The conflict was revealed with dramatic suddenness last Thursday , when the official German news agency flashed a bulletin by radio . It said : " Special announcement : Today an attempt was made on the life of the Fuehrer with explosives . " This was followed by silence for several hours , including severance of all wire communications with the outside world . Hitler 's Account Then Hitler took to the radio to assure the people that he was " unhnrt and well " and to give them " the details about a crime that has no equal in German history . " He said : An extremely small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time foolish , criminally stupid officers hatched a plot to remove me and , together with me , virtually to exterminate the staff of the German High Command . ? ? ? At an hour el which the German Army is waging a very hard struggle there has appeared in Germany a very small group , similar to that in Italy , that believed it could thrust a dagger into our back as it did in 1918. * * ? It is a very small clique of criminal elements , which will now be exterminated quite mercilessly . ? * * To create order at last , I have appointed Reich Minister Himmler head of the Gestapo to be commander of the army at home . Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz , navy chief , and Reichsmarshal Hermann Goering , as head of the Luftwaffe , followed Hitler on the radio to warn their respective commands : " Accept only orders from me " and  --  Goering emphasized ? " when in doubt , confirm by telephone . " In these urgent precautions , and in the fact that no such spokesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something more than " a very small clique of criminal elements " was involved in the alleged threat to Hitler . The German propaganda machine stuck to that line for a while , but gradually its statements painted a picture with wider and deeper implications . It said there had been an attempt to seize Government offices in Berlin , the powerful Deutschlandsender broadcasting station and other communications . It claimed there was in the plot a definite link to foreign interests  --  presumably in Russia , where dozens of high German officers have grouped around the Junker Gen. Walther von Seydlitz , captured at Stalingrad , a long-time Hitler opponent . Behind the Censorship From other sources , filtering through censorship and propaganda , came accounts of mutiny among troops at the front , clashes between the Wehrmacht and SS troops in the Reich . What was happening among civilians was a mystery . On the one hand there were reports of violent disturbances and on the other of deserted streets patrolled only by SS detachments and the Gestapo . Part of Berlin was reported blocked off while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go no one could say . The Nazis announced that Col. Gen. Ludwig Beck , former Chief of Staff and a noted dissident from Hitler 's policies , was " no longer among the living . " Col. Count Klaus von Stauffenberg , accused of being the man who threw or planted the bomb , was executed . There was no word of the long list of others who had held high place and great prestige but who had fallen from favor  --  Haider , von Falkenhausen , von Rundstedt , von Brauchitsch , von Bock , Keitel and many more . All indications were that it was the most drastic " blood cleansing " in the history of Hit-. ler vs. the Generals . Suspicious Partners The duel had been on from the . time Hitler took office in 1933 . There was suspicion of the Fuehrer on the part of the old-school Prussian leaders of the army , but on the other hand Hitler offered the support of the public , a propaganda machine to build prestige , access to the coffers of the Reich for great armaments programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Storm Troopers , the Nazi party army led by Ernst Roehm , but the blood purge of 1934 removed Roehm . In 1938 , with Hitler 's hand stronger than every the issue was army eompliasice with Hitler 's plans for expansion . This time the purge was bloodless , but the conservative marshals went out . The war brought other kinds of disagreement . Hitler 's insistence on trying to hold Stalingrad , the African adventure , most recently the decision to give priority to the western front  --  these had produced disputes , and dismissals . Now , apparently , affairs had come to a head ; either the old-schodl , coldminded professionals thought it was time to seek a peace outlet or they insisted that the Wehrmacht 's lines be shortened if the fight was to go on . Hitler 's spokesmen referred to " cowardice and incompetence " among generals who had been removed . Allied observers thought it more likely that some of his commanders had seen enough of Hitler 's own personal brand of strategy . In the nine weeks since the start of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , their armies had suffered in the neighborhood of 750,000 casualties , had lost approximately 85,000 square miles of territory and mountains of their best equipment . They were still fighting on extended lines in Normandy , Russia and Italy ; they were holding deep salients in the Balkans and Norway with perhaps fifty divisions that were needed nearer home . The Fuehrer 's First Task In any case , Hitler 's immediate problem last week seemed less a matter of future strategy than it was of holding his army together where it stood . If the split at the top was strictly on military vs. party influence there was no telling where it would end . The Prussian tradition  --  the stiff allegiance fostered in the Kriegsakademie at Berlin ? is believed by military analysts to extend at least as far down as the colonels . Below that , loyalty appears to run into conflict between personal feeling and party conviction . The test last week was whether the rank and file would continue to follow Hitler or would try to join their superiors in revolt . Heinrich Himmler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army in the Reich , has the nickname of " The Schoolteacher " ? from his cool , bland face and pince-nez glasses . All Germany knows the name belies his nature . In his hands is more power than any other Hitler henchman holds . He is Minister of the Interior , chief of the Gestapo , commander of the Schutzstaffel , or Elite Guards . From one end of Europe to the other his name is known for secret terror and open butchery . He is a strong man , where strength is needed : Within Germany is a populace that " THE WAR IS NOW IN ITS DECISIVE PRASE " ?
