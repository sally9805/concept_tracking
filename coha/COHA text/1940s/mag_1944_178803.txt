One of the last of the original New Dealers left Government service last week. * Lanky , begoggled James Lawrence Fly , chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , had finished his job , and done it well . Some of the men who had most maligned him ( top executives of the major U.S. networks , independent U.S. radio operators ) begged him not to quit . There were even suggestions that the industry provide funds to raise his $10,000 salary to $50,000 . Once they thought that Fly wanted to control the content of their programs . They knew now that he had been their bulwark against Government ownership . <P> " Larry " Fly came to Washington in 1929 by way of Texas , the U.S. Naval Academy , Harvard Law School , and private law practice in Manhattan . He joined the Department of Justice 's Antitrust Division under President Hoover . There he won national renown by defeating Wendell Willkie in the historic battle of the Tennessee Valley Authority v. Commonwealth &; Southern . Said Willkie : " He is the most dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Moonlit Mackerel . When Franklin Roosevelt appointed Fly to the FCC chairmanship in 1939 , FCC was a seven-man tangle of bickering members . Its job was to regulate radio , telegraph and telephone communications , but it was not having much success . Radio , as Fly saw it , was a newly rich business which had little idea of its public responsibility . It was , he decided , a " duopoly " dominated by two national networks ( NBC and CBS ) , and Fly set out to break it . <P> The struggle was bitter ( he once paraphrased John Randolph , saying that radio management reminded him " of a dead mackerel in the moonlight which both shines and stinks , " and management replied in kind ) . The fight ended with a blockbuster which the Supreme Court dropped on the industry in 1943 , ruling that FCC had the power to enforce its regulations on the radio industry . The sum of these regulations was the freeing of the 900-odd U.S. stations from total network domination ( TIME , May 24 , 1943 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear their hair and howl that they were not long for this world. * But it nailed down Fly 's main objectives : 1 ) reduction of NBC from two chains to one ( the Blue became a separate network ) ; 2 ) the end of dual ownership ( no one can now own two radio stations in a single city ) ; 3 ) the stations ' awareness of the fact that they also exist to serve their own communities and the public . <P> Beautiful Opportunity . The telegraph and telephone fields have also felt the weight of Fly 's hand . He improved the efficiency of U.S. telegraph service by fighting for the merger of Postal and Western Union . He insisted that long distance telephone rates be reduced ; the reduction has meant a yearly saving of upwards of a quarter of a billion dollars to telephone users . <P> No visionary , Larry Fly , 46 , is an intelligent , careful liberal who believes in finding and stubbornly serving the facts . Congressional investigations of his office have merely proved his competence . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " make some money for my old age . " Says he : <P> " . . . The stations are making money , and they now have a beautiful opportunity to get tough and raise their own standards . "
