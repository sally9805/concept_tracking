THE WORKMANSHIP HAS TO BE WASTED A STORY BY ALEXANDER LAING T ryINE starter watched Mrs. Madison . She turned slowly , staring in awful distrust at the Assyrian doors of the elevators , six on one side , six on the other , and three of them half open . " What floor , lady ? " " I 'm not sure . The address just says 5642 . " " Fitty-six ' floor , " he told her , in a tone of sad wonder at having so often to explain the obvious . " Express . " A sweep of his scarlet arm wafted her into one of the cars before she had even made up her mind that she dared . " Ayuh , " the Negro operator said to the starter . " OPM'Il back a Mack off the Avenue , clear in hyah in the lobby . Cart mah fancy doors away to one of them great big kettles . Melt ' em right down into p'opcliers or somepin ' . Any day now . " Two men with brief cases marched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elevator , ignoring each other importantly . Although their appearance was gentlemanly , they did not take off their homburg hats . Looking between them , Mrs. Madison watched the closing doors of the local shaft opposite : doors embellished with half-kneeling bronze figures in low relief , their heads twisted impossibly backward . " Man made them doors , he be prctty cut up , " the operator mused aloud . " Melt them pretty doors into engine bearin 's , or mebbe bomb noses . " As the car accelerated smoothly , Mrs. Madison had a Jules Verne image of herself being shot to the moon from a slender building that had become an enormous vertical gun . But the car slowed to a gentle stop . The doors slid softly back against their rubber bumpers . Standing upon firmness again , to wait for her stomach to catch up with the rest of her body , she made the half-panicky gesture that so quickly had become automatic , feeling for and pressing the hard lumps under her tight black coat . A journey all round the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last door , a few feet from where she had started . The glass was lettered " Van Zoom and Nephew . " No one answered her knock . A pretty double chime sounded as she pushed the door open , repeating as it closed of itself behind her . She was alone in a very small anteroom with three yellow chairs on a nubbly magenta carpet . No pictures hung against the aquamarine walls . There was not even a table piled with National Geographies . Mrs. Madison wondered when she last had seen a National Geographic . She had stopped all the subscriptions after her husband 's death . In the wall at the left there was a triangular opening , just too small for any human body to squeeze through . A middle-aged , long-nostrilled woman stared inquiringly from beyond the glass . Mrs. Madison pushed under the edge of it a crumpled clipping from the want ad page of the Sun . " This is this place ? " she asked , indicating the lowest of several pencil-marked addresses . " Van Zoom and Nephew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trill . " Whom do you wish to see , madam ? " Memory of older occasions came back full strength at last as Mrs. Madison said decisively , " Mr. Van Zoorn , if it is convenient . " Her heart was pounding more slowly , but pounding still . The woman behind the glass looked critically at clothes that might or might not express the quirks of a fabulous old female tightwad . Playing safe , she said , " Mr. Raymond Van Zoorn could see you shortly . Mr. Van Zoorn himself is out . " A rhythmic clicking , as of the lock on her daughter-in-law 's new apartment house , indicated that a button had been pressed to make it possible for Mrs. Madison to push open the knobless door at her right . The next room was much larger . A counter , topped with black velvet , ran from wall to wall a couple of yards out from the windows . A slim young woman , her shoulders beautiful in tailored russet sharkskin , was perched on a tall chromium stool on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and baldheaded young man was nodding vigorously as he said , " Yes  --  yes  --  Mrs. Koppers . Not easy , you so well understand . But it commands of us the beautiful workmanship . Yes . " They took no notice of Mrs. Madison as she walked to a lower chair at the other end of the severe counter . The young woman 's hair reminded Mrs. Madison of that of her son 's wife . Lucy 's had gone straight and lank for a month or two , as if she did n't care about anything . But now , in her new apartment , she was wearing it longer , puffed back prettily over the shoulders somewhat like this too excellent example of planned unruliness . " And then the cartouche , Mr. Van Zoorn . I 'm playing a long hunch , are n't I ? But I 'm just certain they 'll bethe thing again by spring . You ' 31 think I 'm silly , bet , but I asked Madame Zelda about that . It 's simply unbelievable the things she 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask her about the market . He says she ca n't be any crazier than those people on the Exchange Commission , or whatever it is , that make everything so hard these days . " " It is your wearing it that will make the cartouche fashionable again , Mrs. Koppers . Madame Zelda is quite safe about that , as she is so shrewd that she can know it . " " Well , I hope you 're both right . " The girl leaned forward , drawing with a childish awkwardness that came oddly from a body otherwise so graceful . " The initials of my husband and myself , this way , in absolutely the tiniest diamonds and rubies . I think big stones are so vulgar these days , with the terrible taxes and everything . How small can you cut them ? I want them specially cut . " " Yes . They can be closely microscopic . But comes a point where cost increases , the smaller and smaller they are . " " But obviously . What I have in mind is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no National Geographies anywhere . Mrs. Madison took from her bag the only reading matter in it : a half-finished letter to her son , her third attempt to break the news she had not yet been able to surrender to the mails . I should have mentioned before that Lucy and I have rented the house , but I wanted first to see how it would work out , and now I can tell you everything is just fine . She 's taken a very nice one-room apartment at the Jersey , and I 've got a lovely room at Mrs. Clark 's . Both together cost just what we get for the house . Please do n't think there was any unpleasantness , my dear boy . It 's just that you are the only interest we really have in common , and when you were called to active service . . . Mrs. Koppers was saying , " Now how much is a quarter of an inch ? " The jeweler showed her . " I know . What I have in mind would be at least ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that would be vulgar the opposite way ? " Mrs. Madison felt the building swaying again . She remembered a drawing in the newspaper of the slantwise path of a bomb falling against a skyscraper , intended to prove that all but its highest and lowest storeys would be safer than an ordinary building could be . But she did not feel safe . . . . Lucy has been very sweet always , and she comes to see me and Igo to see her . Now that the President says the shooting has started I do n't see how we can expect it to stop till you 've won your war , just as your father and your grandfathers won theirs . But as soon as it 's over I 'll be right back in the house with you , whether you like it or not . . . . Mrs. Koppers was standing , the transaction apparently over . " You call me right away , " she said , " the minute the patterns are ready . It 's so convenient being at the Elbridge Towers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for their first year . Just a step from practically everything . You ca n't imagine what we save on taxis . " Mr. Van Zoom stole his first glance toward the other visitor , but Mrs. Koppers went lightly on . " After you 've chosen most of your things I suppose it 's in the cards to settle down some place farther up the Avenue . But I for one am going to hang right on at the Elbridge till our things begin to drop out the windows . Our place is just a pied-a-terre , my husband says . But that 's true of all the apartments . So sensible in your first year . " After the latch at last had clicked , the stout young jeweler maintained his bow for a moment . Then he walked briskly to the other end of the counter . " I am so sorry for this keeping you waiting . " Mrs. Madison did not regret the delay . She felt composed , almost businesslike at last as she said , " I have some ? " Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter-in-law 's new friend , the lawyer . " I wonder if you would care to bid on some stones I may offer for sale . " " We are glad to be privileged to see them  --  madam . " " My name is Florence Madison  --  Mrs. Madison . " " Yes , Mrs. Madison . The light is better a little in my office . " As he went round to open a door from the far side she unfastened the safety-pins that held a manila envelope to her coat lining . " These are Golconda stones . My husband 's father brought them from India . He used to say they were a better anchor to windward than any insurance policy . " " He was a sailor . So my grandfather was , " Mr. Van Zoom commented , staring briefly at the two stones through a little bucket-shaped black instrument . One stone was set in a circular gold locket , the other in a brooch . " Both imperfect , like most old mine stones . " " I understood that they were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their kind . This is too yellow by modern standards . This of the brooch is better . " Mrs. Madison 's heart was trip-hammering again . While Mr. Van Zoorn was measuring the stones with calipers and jotting on a pad , she tried to divert her mind to other matters . But she succeeded only in remembering what she would not acknowledge to herself that she had even seen : her daughter-in-law 's expression as she shook her fluffy hair before admitting the jaunty young lawyer and the frown on her face when he said casually that he had few clients so conveniently located as right across the apartment-house hall . " The locket stone would weigh perhaps ninety-five points . The brooch is close to two karats . What do you ask , madam ? " " I was asking for your bid . I have others . " The jeweler took a worn little notebook from his vest pocket and studied it . " The smaller stone would be about eighty dollars a karat . The other is perhaps worth a hundred a karat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , her eyes widening . " My husband said the larger one alone was appraised at eight hundred dollars . " " It seems high , Mrs. Madison , but not impossible if long ago . Were you to authorize their removal from the settings then I put them on the scales . " " But what is your bid just as they are ? " " Without weighing them I can offer seventy dollars for the smaller stone , one hundred eighty for the larger . " " But I am sure there is a mistake . I had a loan on them for much more than that . And I borrowed from  --  from someone else , to redeem them and get the extra value by selling them . " " Unfortunate . Such stones were valued more highly a few years ago . You should have let the lender foreclose . " He made as if to push the jewels back toward her . Mrs. Madison 's look was desperately imploring , as she blurted , " My sort was a reserve officer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . The pay is hardly enough for his wife now . I do n't want to be a burden . Do n't you see ? I was told that diamonds had gone up . " " Small stones have , for war industries , and also stones in need of no re-cutting . It would be twenty-five dollars a karat to have these recut , and ? " " And you would lose a quarter of their weight in the process , " she broke in suddenly as she slumped thinly in the chair . " Yes , I know . " What was the good of trying to act over again , with a fool 's hope in each increasingly elegant office , her first incredulous despair ? Beginning at Third Avenue at street level , she had been told these same things . Why should these people believe her story about the loan ? That it was true was no help before the always courteous men who knew their business so well  --  these men who in their vest pockets carried infallible little books that always produced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less . " I 'll accept your offer , I think now , " she said wearily . " What are the settings worth ? " " Only the value weight of old gold , I 'm afraid . " He weighed the pieces on a scale in a glass box , and added , " Nineteen dollars , assuming fourteen-karat gold . " " My husband had them made for me when his father gave us the stones , forty-seven years ago . All the workmanship has to be wasted , does n't it ? " He turned the simple round locket in his palm . " Taste changes , " he admitted . " It is so . The workmanship has to be wasted every generation . But what can we do ? The clipper ship of your father . So beautiful . So were my grandfather 's ships . I have three , in pictures , marvelous , intricate , but of what use now ? " As he was writing a check the double-chime sounded twice . When Mrs. Madison went out , Mrs. Koppers was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she called , " I think this is maybe a simply marvelous idea I 've just got . Could n't you put a little extra band inside that could come out in case I put on weight ? You ca n't ever know ? " The door shut on the young anxieties of Mrs. Koppers . The elevator was full , going down . A man was saying , " Yeah , just come in over the radio . American destroyer sunk up round Iceland or somewheres . Seven million bucks of beautiful machinery at the bottom of the Atlantic . Now if that man in the White House ? " Amid the waves of numbness that swept over her Mrs. Madison wondered , after all she had dared in the last two days , whether she dared ask him the vessel 's name .
