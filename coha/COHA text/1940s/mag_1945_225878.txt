BHAGAVADGITA , The Song of God-translated by Swami Prabhavananda and Christopher Isherwood - Marcel Rodd Co. ( $1.50 ) . <P> Ten years ago Christopher Isherwood was one of the most promising of younger English novelists , and a member of the radical , pacifist literary set sometimes known as " the Auden circle . " Now , thinking seriously of becoming a swami ( religious teacher ) , he is studying in a Hindu temple in Hollywood , Calif . <P> Much-traveled Author Isherwood 's early novel , The Last of Mr. Norris ( TIME , May 20 , 1935 ) , was a grisly , eyewitness account of British pro-Nazis in Berlin . His Journey to a War ( with verse commentary by W. H. Auden ) was a stark , unromanticized look at embattled China . Now this rebellious son of a British lieutenant colonel lives monastically with three other men and eight women in a small house adjoining the alabaster temple of the Vedanta Society of Southern California . He shares his income and the housework with his fellow students , and daily ponders the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace , Peace , Peace ! " Three times each day Isherwood repairs to the temple , sits cross-legged between grey-green walls on which are hung pictures of Krishna , Jesus , Buddha , Confucius , other great religious teachers . The swami enters bareheaded , wearing a long , bright yellow robe that sweeps the floor . He too sits crosslegged , pulls a shawl around him , and for ten minutes meditates in silence . Then in a ringing bass he chants a Sanskrit invocation , repeats it in English , ending with the words , " Peace , Peace , Peace ! " <P> This dispassionate ceremony is the ritual of a mystical order of which slight , agreeable , cigaret-smoking Swami Prabhavananda is the Los Angeles leader . It is an outgrowth of a small monastic community founded in India late last century in the name of Sri Ramakrishna , one of the great teachers of Indian Vedanta , the underlying philosophy of Indian religion . <P> Mystical Movement . Of late , Prabhavananda 's teaching has attracted enough expatriate English literary men to create a minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1920s , studied privately with the swami . His latest novel , Time Must Have a Stop , bears the marks of his study . Erudite Philosopher Gerald Heard ( Pain , Sex and Time ; The Ascent of Humanity ) , son of an Anglican churchman and a professed agnostic since youth , was another private pupil . Like slick Manhattan Dramatist John van Druten , ( Voice of the Turtle , I Remember Mama ) , both contribute to the society 's magazine Vedanta and the West , now co-edited by Isherwood . Larry , the dissatisfied young hero of Somerset Maugham 's current best-selling novel , The Razor 's Edge , whose search for faith ended in Vedanta , is said to be modeled on Isherwood . <P> Vedanta ( less correctly but more frequently called Hinduism ) is the-philosophy derived from the oldest religious writings in the world : the collection of ancient Indian scriptures called the Vedas . The common basis of India 's many religious sects , it teaches the fundamental sameness of all religion . Its basic tenets are : 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his purpose on earth is to manifest this eternally hidden divinity ; 3 ) that truth is universal .
