txt // may not do so in subjects troubled with constipation . They attributed this to the greater loss of fiber in traversing the alimentary tract of constipated subjects as compared to normal persons . " Experiments on men are not entirely conclusive as far as constipation studies are concerned . It is well known that women are more prone to become constipated than are men . It is interesting , therefore , to note that Rose and her coworkers ( 31 ) have studied the influence of bran on the alimentary tract of healthy women . As a result of these studies it was shown that the addition of bran to a controlled diet produced marked increases in the total weight and dry weight of the stools . " In a recent paper by Parsons ( 41 ) it is pointed out that the problem of fecal elimination is largely an individual one which is affected by many factors in addition to the amount of fiber in the diet . It is difficult to evaluate the results of her experiments as compared with other reports in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance which subjective impressions may play in such experiments with persons . " It seems reasonable to conclude from the evidence available that the weight of the fecal material and the number of bowel movements daily are dependent largely on the bulk in the diet , and that in normal men and women and in some constipated subjects , both may be increased by the ingestion of suitable amounts of bran . It also appears to be demonstrated that the fiber of bran is more resistant to decomposition in the alimentary tract than the fiber of many ordinary foods .. The number of daily bowel movements that can be considered normal , however , is still open for further investigation . There is evidence also that some foods , such as prunes and fruit juices , may exert an effect which can not be attributed to fiber or balk . It may also be pointed out that other components of the usual diet , such as carbohydrates and fats , may exert an effect on what Cowgill // and Anderson have called laxation . ' Finally it may be noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dietary studies showing the relation of bulk to constipation in children . " THE INFLUENCE OF BULK ON PROTEIN UTILIZATION AND MINERAL RETENTION " Indigestible carbohydrates in bran must be considered in relation to their effect on the digestibility of other proteins and on the retention of minerals . Mendel and Fine , for example , showed with dogs that the addition to the diet of indigestible material such as agar or bone ash resulted in an increase in the fecal nitrogen . This effect has been shown by others to occur in persons also . In explanation it has been suggested that the presence of bulk may retard proteolytic digestion ; a greater amount of metabolic nitrogen from digestion juices , and so on , which escape reabsorption , is produced ; the intestinal contents are propelled more rapidly and hence not as completely absorbed . Whatever the reason , it appears that the effect produced by moderate amounts of fiber on protein digestion , while definite , is slight . ( 34 ) . With abnormally high amounts of roughage , such as might be found in certain Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite lowering of protein digestibility . " Whitacre , Willard and Blunt ( 43 ) found that the addition of fiber in the form of vegetables had no effect on the utilization of dietary fat . Morgan ( 44 ) studied the effect of the ingestion of moderate amounts of a cellulose preparation on young women . She found a slightly increased excretion of fecal nitrogen and a definite increase in the excretion of phosphorus , calcium and fecal ash . She questions the wisdom of giving a high roughage diet to children or to older persons under conditions of a marginal intake of calcium . " // DISADVANTAGES FROM THE USE OF BRAN " In addition to the effect of bran on calcium excretion , there are other possible disadvantages to its use which demand thoughtful consideration . To many individuals bran is irritating to the mucous lining of the intestinal tract . It is self evident that bran or other rough foods may do serious injury if included in the diet of patients who recently have undergone operation of the stomach or intestine or who suffer with ulcer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patients with such conditions occasionally develop constipation . Also at times patients with ulcerative colitis of amebic or bacterial origin develop constipation . If under any of these circumstances bran is resorted to as a means of relieving the constipation , the previously diseased tissue will be irritated with results that may be disastrous . " It generally is less well appreciated that the constipation of many otherwise healthy individuals results from spasticity of the colon and under these circumstances that bland diets are more effective in controlling the constipation than is any rough , mechanically irritating food like bran . In such cases bran may so intensify the spasticity that obstruction necessitating mechanical or even surgical removal may result from its use ( 45 ) . " It is the experience of many physicians that otherwise normal persons who suffer from constipation due solely to inadequate bulkiness of their diets will develop irritable colons if bran is taken in excessive doses for a short time or in ordinary doses continuously for longer times ( 46 ) . Vague abdominal pains occur , associated with bloating , belching and excessive flatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is discontinued . " Danger from the use of bran is greatest when constipated individuals eat bran , and , not obtaining relief with small portions , take larger quantities of this rough , mechanically irritating food . The indiscriminate use of bran without // the supervision of physicians therefore is undesirable . While many constipated persons without any digestive disorders may be benefited by the addition to their diets of bran in doses that are not excessive , alternating the use of bran with agar and other allied products or the provision of diets containing an adequate amount of residue less coarse than bran is considered to be a more desirable therapeutic procedure . " GENERAL DECISION ON ALLOWABLE CLAIMS FOR WHEAT BRAN " On the basis of the evidence reviewed in the foregoing report , the Council on Foods has considered the place of wheat bran in the human diet and has adopted the following general decision : " 1 . Bran may be useful as a source of bulk in the diet . The position of the Council in regard to Constipation Statements in Lay Advertising for Roughage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any reference in labels or advertising directed to the public regarding the content of bulk or crude fiber can not be permitted unless there is reproduced the complete statement in the Committee Decision referred to , regarding a permissible claim for a roughage food . This statement is reproduced as follows : " ' Constipation due to insufficient roughage in the diet should yield to . . . eaten regularly . A competent physician should be consulted for cases not corrected in this simple manner . ' " It is not permissible to advertise the use of bran in the treatment of constipation due to insufficient bulk . ' This statement by itself encourages self-treatment , which may cause harm in those persons for whom bran is contraindicated. " 2 . The iron content of untreated bran is high . Special claims for bran as a source of iron in the diet can not be recognized , however , until definite evidence is obtained and // accepted by the Council to show that the iron of untreated bran is available to the human body and , in the amounts which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily requirements . " If iron salts should be added in the preparation of bran for human consumption , the presence of added iron should be declared on the label , in accordance with present regulations of the Council requiring a complete list of ingredients and quantities thereof entering into the product in the case of food mixtures or compounds . " 3 . The amount of vitamin B 1 in bran is insufficient to permit any special claims therefor . " CHAPTER V THE NUTRITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF WHITE AND BROWN FLOUR ONE of the difficulties frequently met with in a study of the literature which deals with data obtained in flour feeding experiments , is to get a clear picture of the exact kind of flour used . It is for this reason that such data often loses much of its value and it is difficult to make comparison of one set of data with another , unless the types of flour used have been defined with exactness . Flour , being a manufac tured product , is subject to many alterations in composition , depending on how it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Likewise the same method of manufacture at any chosen degree of extraction , using different wheats , also produces flours of different composition . This factor should be borne in mind in any consideration of published results , unless the character of the flour is defined with exactness , as fortunately it is in some cases . There are three terms constantly used in the literature , namely , " Graham flour , " " whole-wheat flour , " and " entire-wheat flour . " The first of these terms is based on the name of Sylvester Graham , who , over a hundred years ago , was an ardent advocate of bread made from a 100% wheat flour . Perhaps the term " Graham flour " is used in scientific litera ture mainly in the sense just defined , but of this we can not be absolutely certain unless the term is more closely defined . That even this term has been somewhat loosely applied can be seen by reference to a definition found in Bulletin 13 , of the U. S. Department of Agriculture , published in 1898 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham flour should convey the idea of a flour made from well-cleaned and dusted wheat , ground , but not bolted . Flours , however , are often sold as Graham flour in which the bolting process has been carried out to a greater or less extent . The true Graham flour would contain practically the same substances as the wheat kernel itself , and in the same proportions . " The term " Graham flour " was also defined in 1901 by Snyder , in somewhat similar terms ( 49 ) : " Graham Flour . This is the entire wheat kernel ( bran and all ) ground into meal . The presence of the bran prevents the fine grinding of the material , and particles of the bran are apparent when the flour is examined . Graham flour is practically wheat meal . No sieves or bolting cloths are employed in its manufacture and many coarse particles of unpulverized material are present in the product . " In the older definitions , when we come to " whole-wheat " flour and " entire-wheat flour , " there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier days , but certainly they are far from being sufficiently exact to be used for a closer definition of their identity . Bulletin 13 ( 48 ) defines " entire-wheat flour " in the following terms : " Entire wheat flour . This name would materially carry the idea of a flour corresponding to the Graham flour above . It is , however , a trade mark for the flour produced in a special manner , by grinding the whole wheat after the removal of the outer coverings . It , therefore , contains all of the ingredients of the wheat grain , save those which are found in the outer coverings . " Snyder in defining " entire-wheat " ( 49 ) defines it much the same : " Entire-wheat flour . This is the product obtained by removing a portion of the bran and then grinding the remainder of the wheat kernel. . . . " // On page 5 of this same Bulletin , Snyder has this to say with respect to " whole-wheat " : " . . . the so-called whole-wheat ' or entire-wheat flour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bran . " That is , according to Snyder 's definition , " whole-wheat " and " entire-wheat " flours are the same , since no distinction is made between them . There is an uncertainty as to the degree of extraction and hence of their composition . Something a bit more definite is to be found in a statement of Langworthy and Duel ( 50 ) in 1919 : " The bulk of wheat used for flour in this country is made into patent flour which contains about 720/0 of the wheat kernel . Entire or whole-wheat flour which contains 85% of the wheat and true Graham flour which contains 10000 are also well-known commodities . " Turning to the so-called official standards which were evolved during the reign of the Federal Food and Drugs Act , June 30 , 1906 , we find somewhat definite standards of identity set up for these flours . In the standard promulgated in 1928 ( 51 ) the term " Graham flour " is described in the following terms : " Graham flour is unbolted wheat meal . " In 1930 this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " entire-wheat " flour ( 52 ) : " Whole wheat flour , entire wheat flour , Graham flour is the clean , sound product made by grinding wheat , and contains , in their natural proportions , all of the constituents of the cleaned grain . " In passing , it should be pointed out that this 1930 definition abandons the idea held in the 1928 definition , that // Graham flour should be unbolted wheat meal . No reference is made to the product being unbolted in the latest flour standard established under the Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act in 1941 ( 7 ) , but it is essentially the standard of 1930 . Numerous references will be made to the experimental findings of investigators of the feeding values of wheat products . Mention will be made of the nutritive or biological value of wheat proteins . This is a subject not alone of purely scientific interest , but it is one of great practical interest as well , for wheat products are the most nutritionally valuable of all plant foods widely used in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such foodstuffs and they form a notable percentage of the calorie intake of our people . Another practical phase which makes knowledge of the nutritive characteristics of wheat important , is the fact that wheat is our most valuable agricultural crop . For a clearer understanding of the place of proteins in our diet and for a general appraisal of our knowledge of the experimental data available concerning them , the following brief discussion of this subject by McCollum is much to the point ( 53 ) : " Nutritional Value of the Common Proteins. ? It has been emphasized that the nutritive value of protein is ultimately dependent upon the amino acid content . Moreover , consideration has been given to the relationship between nutritive value and such factors as protein digestibility and the level of protein in the dietary . These variables are considered in estimating the nutritive value of proteins . " In practical dietetics neither animals nor man are ever restricted to a single protein as a source of the necessary amino acids . Hence data upon the nutritive value of the individual proteins are actually of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such dietary essentials . But it is advantageous to consider lint , as a basis for subsequent attention , the data on individual proteins . However , one should be particularly critical in the // use of . . . tables of protein in nutrition . One must realize that there is no general agreement concerning methods of estimating the nutritional value of proteins . Consequently it has been necessary to employ an arbitrary policy in preparing such tables . At best the numerical data constitute only approximations of the actual nutritional value of the proteins which they represent . Certainly one is not able to make distinctions from them concerning the relative value of the proteins in such general functions as growth , maintenance , reproduction , and lactation . It must be assumed , until more refined analytical distinctions can be made , that the value of a protein in any one of these functions is approximately similar with respect to all of them . " Boas-Fixsen has this to say about biological values of proteins ( 54 ) : " The biological or nutritional value of proteins has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , are of doubtful value . Before these often conflicting results can be properly assessed , it is necessary to make a critical examination of the various methods employed . All , save one , fall into two classes , according as the criterion used is the maintenance of nitrogenous equilibrium or the maintenance or increase of the body weight . " A review of the methods applicable to the problem of such determination is not only found in the article of BoasFixsen just cited , but also in " The Biochemistry of the Amino Acids " by Mitchell and Hamilton ( 55 ) . The literature on the nutritional characteristics of white and brown flour is very large . An adequate evaluation of the experimental work is often most difficult , if not impossible , but throughout the work there is something of a general trend even if it can not all be given in terms of wholly reliable quantitative figures , for some reasons , which have been very briefly referred to above . // Mohs , Director of the Institute of Milling , Berlin , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some German findings . The following is taken from Mohs ' article , published in 1936 in the Northwestern Miller and American Baker ( 57 ) : " Because many persons obtain about half their daily requirement of 100 grams ( 3% oz. ) of protein through the consumption of bread , it is very important from the economic point of view to know what the science of nutrition has to say about the question : Which is more advantageous , to eat whole-grain bread or bread made from refined flour , or is the utilization of bread protein influenced by the bran content of the breadT It is equally important that a satisfactory answer be made to the claim : It is a serious physiological error to remove the bran from bread flour . Both proteins and carbohydrates are approximately equally resorbed from breads made from flours of different degrees of extraction . The modern system of milling is a constant menace to the health and nutrition of the people . ' " . .. Rubner ( 58 ) was the first to summarize the data on digestibility experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more bran bread contains , the less digestible it is . At 82% extraction ( Hungarian ) the digestibility of bread begins to decline to a marked extent . Difficulty of digestibility in bread is due to the branny constituents , i.e. , to the protein from the gluten cells . The digestive juices are not able to penetrate these cells , and the branny coatings are broken down only to a small extent . The principal obstacle to digestibility is the cell membranes of the kernel . ' " P. Lindner ( 59 ) confirmed these findings in the following experiment : He took kernels emptied of their contents by weevils , stuffed them with aleurone cells removed from other kernels with a razor , and ate the stuffed kernels . The cells were recovered intact in the feces without having yielded up their contents . // " R. O. Neumann ( 60 ) says : The cell-rich substances are : generally poorly utilized . The more numerous and the coarser they are , the more material remains undigested . The bran protein is enclosed in resistant cells ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escapes the action of the digestive juices and is partly lost . The more bran remains in the flour , the higher is the content of cell membranes and the poorer the utilization of the bread . This goes hand in hand with a decrease in the digestibility of the protein substances . ' " Recently W. Heupke ( 61 ) has carried out artificial ( in vitro ) digestion experiments with pepsin and trypsin ( enzymes present in the digestive juices ) acting on coarse bran in a test tube . After the bran had stood in contact with digestive juices for four hours , three-fourths of the nitrogenous compounds present were digested out of the unopened cells of the aleurone layer . This , in Heupke 's opinion , proves that the assumption that bran proteins are difficultly digestible and that for this reason they should be left out of bread , is unfounded and erroneous . * He states further that the more bran bread contains , the greater the amount of waste material excreted , since the large amount of indigestible or difficultly digestible cell wall constituents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time the nitrogen content of the excreted material increases . This increased nitrogen is derived from the nitrogenous fecal pigments , the intestinal mucus that holds the individual particles of excreta together , and the intestinal bacteria , or in other words from substances for which the body has no use , and which are of no more value than urine . The fecal nitrogenous compounds originating from the intestinal walls and their secretions are to be regarded as excreta and not as food residues . " Comparisons of the nitrogen intake and outgo showed that the nitrogen balance was considerably poorer with the coarse breads ; this , however , is not taken to indicate poorer utilization , since approximately 1 gram intestinal nitrogen // must be subtracted for each 20 ? 25 grams of dry feces . When this correction is made it appears , according to Heupke , that the proteins of breads from flours of different degrees of extraction are on the whole about equally resorbed and that there is no essential difference between the utilization of fine and coarse breads . " Heupke believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coworkers and by R. 0 . Neumann concerning the utilization of bread , since these relations were not considered in their work . Hence it is necessary to consider Heupke 's claims more closely in their relation to the question under consideration . " Rubner ( 58 ) makes the following statement : There are foods that form feces which contain hardly a trace of the food itself , and consist only of residues of the digestive juices . There are , however , no plant foods that produce only residues of digestive juices , for in plants parts of the cell walls enclosing some protein are always present , in bread as well as other foods derived from plant material . ' " In direct contrast to Heupke , Rubner states : The layman usually thinks that everything leaving the body is indigestible or food residue , but this is a wholly erroneous conception . Digestion takes place in such a way that the more cell membranes are present in the food ingested , the greater the amount of digestive juices required , and a certain definite proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This nitrogenous material appearing in the feces must be considered as a loss which must be taken into account in judging the protein content of a food , since it consists to a large , often predominant extent , of residues of the digestive juices from a product of metabolism . ' " Previously in judging food it was customary to consider only the chemical composition , and thus the idea arose that the bran constituents , which are quite rich in protein , are of value for human nutrition . This idea is commented on further by R. 0 . Neumann ( 60 ) , who says : Judging by the amount of protein , the low-grade would seem considerably // more nutritious than the patent flour , but it would be false to draw such a conclusion , since the human organism is not able to dissolve the protein out of the hard gluten cells to the extent desired . ' He also says : In order to show the utilization values of different foods , artificial digestion experiments are now and then made , in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the amount of material dissolved is determined . This process is , however , quite inadequate since the test tube can by no means replace the chemical factory of the body . In the body we have to deal with an entirely different series of digestive processes , which can not be duplicated in artificial experiments . The only correct ways of making such studies is on the living human subject . ' Neumann then shows that under any circumstances utilization tests on humans are very difficult . " Thus we see that Rubner and R. O. Neumann have long been aware of what Heupke considers new knowledge . Neumann 's numerous experiments may be summarized briefly in the following manner : The cell-rich substances are generally poorly utilized . The greater the amount of these substances and the coarser they are , the more remains undigested . With increasing content of cell membranes , the resorption of proteins and carbohydrates is greatly influenced . The bran protein is inclosed in resistant cells ; when these cells are not ruptured the protein escapes the action of the digestive juices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour , the higher the content of cell membranes , and the more this increases , the poorer is the utilization of the bread , and consequently the lower the digestibility . ' Again quoting from R. O. Neumann : According to Rubner the cellulose is digestible , although only to a very limited extent . Consequently the gluten cells , which contain a relatively large amount of pentosans , must be attackable and the protein contained therein made available for resorption . The many experiments on bread have shown beyond any doubt that in spite of this resorption of cell membranes , the more bran is // present , the poorer the utilization of the bread . Since bran is well digested by animals but not by humans , the admixture or retention of bran in flour is of questionable value from the nutritive point of view . ' " As a rule the final conclusions of Rubner are stated in distorted form ; his views are consequently given here in summary : The separation of bran from flour cuts down the proportion of the kernel available for bread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of animal feed produced ; bread is eaten in conjunction with a small amount of meat and more or less fat . The milling of flour in which finely ground bran is included seems for the most part unnecessary . Thus the idea of a considerable gain in human nutrition by finer grinding of the bran rests on false premises . ' " . . . In view of Neumann 's statement as to the unreliability of digestibility experiments made in the test tube , the value of Gruschwitz ' ( 62 ) experiments may be questioned . However , he arrives at conclusions which are interesting in so far as they show the exact opposite of what Heupke found in similar experiments on the digestibility of the protein of the aleurone cells . Gruschwitz says in conclusion : Whole grain bread contains by far the greatest amount of raw protein . Experiments made in vitro show with greater clearness than experiments with humans that whole grain breads are much less digestible than those from white flour . The fact that the proteins of whole wheat bread are only 55.3% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the protein of the aleurone layer , is on the whole absolutely indigestible . ' " The view is frequently advanced that in whole grain Nature has provided man with a complete and perfect food , and that it is an error to make use of only part of the kernel . This is overlooking the fact that the constitution of the kernel is Nature 's way of equipping it for favorable growing conditions , and that the function of the constituents of the kernel is the feeding of the young plant growing out of it , and not the nutrition of man . In a wonderful combination // the kernel contains the life germ of the future plant and the food for maintaining its life . ' " However , Nature is by no means always the loving , attentive mother of mankind ; does she not also produce seeds , fruits , plants and bacilli that are poisonous to man ? " It has long been known that many of our most important foods are so deficient in calcium compounds that they can not satisfy the calcium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exclusive use will bring about the harmful effects of calcium deficiency . The daily requirement for calcium for the adult human is about 1 gram , and this can be supplied by plentiful consumption of vegetables and milk . The harmful effects of a calcium deficient diet is increased if it contains an excessive proportion of magnesium compounds . " Blood serum which supplies all the organs of the body with calcium contains four times as much calcium as magnesium . Emmerich and Loew ( 63 ) determined that the cereal grains are foremost among the foods that are both low in calcium and too high in magnesium . " Loew has said : Since the magnesium of the kernel is for the most part stored in the same cell layers that go into the bran in milling , it is easy to see why white flour is relatively much poorer in magnesium than whole grain flour . It is not wrong in principle to make flour finer ; the bread from it is more digestible , and this is beneficial to the human organism . Although the calcium content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the calcium-magnesium ratio ( calcium factor ) is very unfavorable . According to Koenig , 1 kilogram of dry bran contains 1.63 grams of calcium and 9.32 grams of magnesium . Bran contains 23.9 times as much magnesium as white flour , while the calcium content is only 4 times higher in bran than in flour . The assertion that bran is especially rich in valuable minerals , and that these minerals must be put to use in the body , is without foundation in fact . Neither is it correct to speak of an abundance of bonebuildiug ' substance , i.e. , calcium phosphate , for the portion // of calcium to phosphoric acid is much too low , amounting to only 1.63 grams of calcium to 27.82 grams phosphoric acid . Even if only half this amount of phosphoric acid were used for bone-building , the amount of calcium required would be 16.5 grams , or 10 times as much as is actually present . Meltzer and Auer of the Rockefeller Institute have shown that the toxic action of magnesium salts on animals can be inhibited by calcium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bran of whole-grain bread will slowly but surely lead to weakening of the digestive organs and to the loss of calcium from the body unless calcium-rich foods are eaten at the same time . ' " These facts show clearly that not only does the digestibility of bread decrease with increasing bran content but also that it is an error from the nutritive and physiological point of view to feed bran to humans . " M. P. Neumann ( 64 ) in describing the composition of the products of milling says : Potassium and calcium decrease with increasing extraction of flour ; magnesium and phosphoric acid , on the other hand , increase with increasing protein and fat content . It appears then that there is a close relation between these last-named constituents and the mineral substances mentioned . Of special interest is the socalled calcium factor , i.e. , the ratio of calcium to magnesium , or the calcium oxide to magnesium oxide , in the different products of milling . The endosperm flours are relatively and in part absolutely ? richer in calcium than the dark flours and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is assumed by many physiologists to be of importance for the mineral value of the bread . " It is almost impossible to come to clarity in the mineral question from an objective point of view . Finally the expression sensible diet , ' which has a sufficient supply of minerals as a requisite , is an ill-defined conception . ' " R. 0 . Neumann ( 60 ) expresses himself as follows with regard to the mineral question : The extent to which the mineral salts concentrated in the bran are utilized Hi hunuin // metabolism is not definitely known , although much sense and nonsense has been written on the subject . Whether the mineral salts play such an important role as heretofore assumed is still uncertain . The matter is important , because the so-called mineral salt question is still vegetating in the uncertain soil of unproved hypotheses . In ordinary life a depletion of salts from the body is little to be feared . The claim that so often worries the public , namely that our diet is too low in mineral salts , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salts necessary for the building up of the body . ' " . . . Although the position of M. P. Neumann ( 64 ) with respect to minerals . . . has already been stated , it is interesting to note his views on the digestibility and nutritive value of bread , as given in his famous work Brotgetreide and Brot ' : " ' Numerous digestion experiments have shown that the utilization of bread by the human digestive system is in- versely proportional to the degree of extraction of the flour , i.e. , that the flour constituents are the - more . indigestible the more of the kernel is extracted . From all the evidence presented it is clear that bread from light flours is better utilized than that from dark flours . ' " Bread should be not merely a supplementary food to be treated as a luxury , but a principal article of diet . In the choice of their principal foods , people generally follow the trends of taste and custom . It is wrong to prescribe a given type of bread for any group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preferences of the majority . So long as a consumer is allowed a free choice , he will eat the bread that appeals to him most . Its appetite appeal will be much more important than its digestibility , two concepts which often are not held separate . When a bread passes through the stomach and intestines without producing symptoms , without causing stomach trouble and intestinal irritation , it ratty be said to agree with the consumer , regardless of how well it is digested . Many people can eat hard58 WHITE VERSUS BROWN FLOUR boiled eggs without difficulty ; when they cause a stomach ache they no longer can be said to agree with the person eating them . Bread may likewise cause stomach disturbances which are highly disagreeable . " R. O. Neumann ( 60 ) says in this connection : That in many persons the indigestible cellulose causes irritation leading to peristaltic motion can not be denied , and that a dietetic effect is often obtained is known to every physician , but this effect may be obtained with other vegetable foods as well . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system with substances like bran and whole-grain bread , which deliver an unusually large amount of feces , because the organism is thereby unnecessarily overtaxed into an expenditure of energy which could more profitably be used for other purposes . Furthermore , coarsely ground and cellulose-containing material may , by fermenting in the intestine , cause unpleasant gas development . During the World War , when people were compelled to eat bread from 9400 ( Hungarian ) flour , a strikingly large number of cases of intestinal disturbances was observed , leading to inflammatory conditions and colicky pains . ' " W. Heupke ( 61 ) rightly contends that in judging the problem of light versus coarse breads , the question of animal nutrition must also be taken into consideration . At present agriculture uses bran as an ingredient of animal feeds , and it is worth while to consider whether the requirements of agriculture are to be preferred to those of human , nutrition . In my opinion there can be no doubt that because of the poorer utilization of bran by humans , the feed requirements of agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not absolutely illogical to deprive animals of bran , a valua-ble feedstuff , in order to furnish humans with a food which is of questionable value , if not actually deleterious ? " The animal converts the bran into vitamin-rich meat and fat , and this is a very valuable service , for man can not live long on dry bread alone . " The renewed elucidation of an old controversial question // would be of little value , however , unless some use were made of the conclusions drawn therefrom . " Wheat and rye , our two important bread grains , consist of about 80% inner floury portion and 20% branny coatings . Milling technic succeeds in separating about 72% of rye flour containing not more than 5% of the finely ground outer coatings . It must be the task and endeavor of the miller to find ways and means of separating the bran and flour so completely that the flour is entirely free from bran , for the lower the bran content of the flour the better it is utilized . If the yield of bran-free flour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutritive advantage gained would be much greater than when the entire kernel is eaten . It is encouraging to learn that processes are now being developed which will make it possible to extract 5 ? /o more flour without any increase in ash content . The developing and perfecting of such processes is not only the task of the milling industry , but it is also in the interest of the people as a whole . " CHAPTER VI THE NUTRITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF WHITE AND BROWN FLOUR ( CONTINUED ) MANY of the nutritional studies which have been made of the various types of wheat flour have been with the view of determining , in some fashion , the quantitative value of the protein which they contain . It is desirable to get a glance at certain phases connected with this protein problem and something about their development . This has been briefly sketched by Cathcart , Regius Professor of Physiology at Glasgow University ( 65 ) . * Cathcart is a member of the War Cabinet Scientific Committee on Food Policy and also a member of the Technical Commission on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from the article in question : " The work of Emil Fischer and Abderhalden on the amino acid constitution of proteins opened up a new field of chemi cal physiology as it accounted for many of the differences which had been noted in the food value of proteins . When , by means of the acid hydrolysis method , it was shown that different proteins contained different percentage amounts of the different amino acids , the explanation seemed to be obvious , then later , in feeding experiments carried out with proteins known to be defective , it was shown that the defects of the diet could be made good by the addition of the missing amino acids , the fundamental concept of biological value was attained . " The other line of advance , which suggested that certain proteins were , so to speak , better than others , was first // adumbrated ( although Busquet a year earlier had carried out some experiments with frogs ) in the paper published in 1909 by Michaud , who stated that in the case of the dog he could maintain nitrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed on dog flesh . Zisterer in 1910 corroborated the experiments of Michaud , maintaining that an animal can subsist on the lowest intake of protein when the protein fed resembles most closely the tissue protein . Following this work there appeared a number of papers for and against the idea . " About the same time , Thomas , in Rubner 's laboratory , published a most interesting paper on what he called the biological values of a very large variety of proteins . This paper aroused a good deal of attention . Thomas accepted the generalization of Rubner that when the minimal nitrogen output is reached , by a course of feeding with nitrogenfree food , the nitrogen excreted arises solely from wear and tear , none of the protein having been used for dynamic purposes . He then set out to determine ? all the experiments were done on himself and were strictly controlled ? how much exogenous protein was required to cover the loss . As a result of his experiments with a variety of proteins derived both from animal and vegetable sources , he arranged his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been adopted by other workers for classifying the proteins ; some of the best of the modern work although along different lines has been carried out by H. H. Mitchell . Generally speaking the biological value is the highest with proteins of animal origin and lowest with vegetable proteins . " It seems now to be generally accepted that the whole explanation of the position of a particular protein in the biological value scale depends on its amino acid make up and by inference , that the closer the amino acid constitution approximates to the bulk of the tissue protein of the animal fed , the higher will be its biological value . Mitchell has rightly pointed out that although it is true that the amino acid constitution of a protein defines the upper limit of its bio62 WHITE VERSUS BROWN FLOUR logical value to the organism , it must not be forgotten that when it comes to practice with its very diverse conditions it is biological factors in general which in the end determine to what extent these limits may be realized . " Recently new light has been shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of Mitchell it would seem to be well established that the biological value is not , as so many people seem to believe , a fixed value irrespective of all other factors . Mitchell and his co-workers have shown that the level of the biological value is largely dependent on the amount of protein present in the diet . They have demonstrated that for each protein the biological values determined vary inversely with the amount of protein in the diet . Liver protein at a level of 8% in the diet has a biological value of 77 ; when the percentage present is doubled the biological value drops to 58 . In another investigation with egg protein the biological values for percentages of 4 , 8 , 12 and 16 were respectively 100 , 91 , 84 , and 62 . With higher percentages of protein in the diet the biological values fell further but as no further increase in the retention of nitrogen above a percentage of 16 takes place , the values obtained are fictitious . " Can we surmise what does happen in the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say we know that the ingested protein is broken down by the proteolytic ferments in the gastrointestinal tract , mainly into amino acids and simple polypeptides and that these in turn are absorbed into the blood stream . It may be added that it is true that small amounts of unchanged protein can be absorbed from the digestive tract . With this absorption the certainty of our knowledge reaches a dead end . We have scraps of information , it is true , but no clear picture of the fate of the ingested material . It is , however , generally accepted that apart perhaps from the special utilization of a wear and tear quota the bulk of the ingested amino acids undergo deamination in the liver , that the freed NH2 groupings are converted into urea for excretion , and the deaminized remainder is in // all probability utilized for the satisfaction of energy needs . This scheme in fact postulates a whole series of catabolic effects . " The work of Schoenheimer and Rittenberg to all intents and purposes disposes of the acceptances , implicitly and explicitly , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surplus to those required for growth and repair , is the predominant event in tissue metabolism . " You may ask what has all this to do with the question at issue , viz. , can the ever-widening gap between so-called first class protein from animal sources and what may generically be called other proteins be bridged ? It is manifest that it can be bridged as there are many hale and hearty true vegetarians , even babes have been brought up on proteins of vegetable origin . The supplementary action of mixed proteins is a very real thing . . . . " With respect to minerals and vitamins , Cathcart says : " There is , of course , no question as to the necessity of intakes of these various substances and of the intimate part they play in the various metabolic processes , but , so far as I can see , the present figures as to the quantitative requirements of the human being are distinctly questionable . The great majority of these figures are based on animal experiments which , interesting enough in themselves , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main reasons . One , that the life span of lower animals , their rate of growth , and the metabolic rate are far removed from those of man ; rapid growth and increased metabolism make greater daily demands than is the case in the human being even in the child . Second , so far as the vitamins at least are concerned , the needs and responses are demonstrably not alike . These differences taken in conjunction with the fact that many of the methods of assessment are very frequently subject to individual bias on the part of the investigator , // render many of the figures generally put forward as suspect if not unreliable ... . " As Durig has sanely remarked , when dealing with standards in alimentation : People who are free to choose their diet will not bother about such standards ; those whose diet is prescribed for them , or who can not afford a proper diet , can not bother about them ; and even specialists and professors of dietetics can not and in any case will not construct their own daily diet according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be grasped that the community is a mass of living individuals with varying tastes , varying desires and varying needs . " Cathcart , in the article from which the above quotations have been taken , speaks of monotony in the diet and of the psychological aspect of the food problem , i.e. , is the food suited to the individual , and he suggests that very little thought is given to what happens in the economy of the subject consuming the diet . " One man 's food may indeed be another man 's poison . There is a strong emotional ele ment associated with the consumption of food . Better a dinner of herbs where love is , than a stalled ox and hatred therewith ; a very true saying . " This psychological aspect of the food problem mentioned by Cathcart has also been discussed by Kellogg and Taylor in their book " The Food Problem , " which is a discussion of nutrition during World War I , as well as a discussion of certain basic nutritional principles ( 66 ) . Under the caption " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 130 . " It is not sufficient that the diet contain the denominated protein , fat , carbohydrate , vitamins , mineral matter , etc . It must contain them in certain ways ; it must be prepared according to certain standards ; it must be consumed under particular surroundings ; it must be served in accordance with selected procedures . A thousand and one external influences determine whether or not a diet , correct // in itself from the standpoint of animal physiology , will be regarded as correct and proper by the consumer . The appearance of food , and its palatability , and the previous experience of the individual have a determining influence so profound that they may actually prevent the digestion and utilization of a particular foodstuff . It is thus true that a diet that would be enti-rely proper and comfortable for a Russian peasant would fail as nourishment for the highly specialized organism of the Russian artist . There is , of course , a great deal under cover of the term ' psychology of nutrition ' that is purely arbitrary idiosyncrasy , that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal that is real and that bears directly not only upon the ingestion of food and upon the sense of satiation but operates also to alter the process of digestion . " In their book on " The Food Problem " Kellogg and Taylor also have something to say about the white vs. brown flour subject : Page 156. " . . . to the American subsisting upon a mixed diet it is possible to cover the needs of the body for mineral intake , water-soluble vitamin and roughage , either by employing the outer layers of the grain in the form of socalled whole wheat flour , or by the free consumption of fruits and vegetables One of these two must be included in the diet ; but it is immaterial which of the two is employed Now , if the total cereal fraction of a diet runs towards the lowest figures given , in other words , towards one-third of the total food value of the diet , the use of whole grains is of little importance . If , on the other hand , a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , for example , of pork products , it would be imperative to use whole wheat rather than patent flour . . . . The belief , however , that the health of a people as a whole depends upon the general use of whole-wheat bread as against white bread is based upon a misconception of the actual relations of the vitamins and salts in a mixed diet . " l // In speaking of the keeping qualities of the longer extraction flours , these authors say : Page 162 . " It has been entirely practicable for the British to produce an 81% flour in England ; but it did not prove practicable to buy an 81% flour in the United States and ship it to England under present conditions of tonnage , because there were heavy losses from decomposition . " Page 192 . " In a small country like Germany or France it is possible to place the entire population upon a fixed ration to be applied to all classes . This is not possible in the United States , nor is it desirable , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet of different sections is widely variant . A traveller transported from the plains of Texas to the hills of New England would regard himself dietetically in a foreign country . . . . " In the article of Cathcart referred to above , he mentions the work of Schoenheimer and Rittenberg and his comments are given . It is desirable to discuss briefly this work of Schoenheimer and his colleagues as it is a splendid illustration of how the views on nutritional problems are in a state of flux and previously held ideas about metabolic processes are bound to undergo profound alteration . Just what effect this may have on other phases of nutrition remains to be seen . This merely leads to the observation that in the present state of the science of nutrition , it may be most unwise to be overly dogmatic about some of its tenets . Schoenheimer of Columbia University in 1941 gave the Edward K. Dunham Lectures for the Promotion of the Medical Sciences , at Harvard University . These three lectures have been published in book form ( 67 ) . In these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by him and his associates , for a better understanding of what takes place within the body when certain types of foodstuffs are ingested . A brief outline of how this problem // has been studied with an entirely new scientific approach is given in the preface to this book . This work of Schoenheimer is based on . . . " the idea of employing a stable isotope as a label in organic compounds , destined for experiments in intermediary metabolism , which should be biochemically indistinguishable from their natural analogues . Justification for this scheme was found in the established fact that the hydrogen in organic matter displays the same isotope abundance as that in common water . " As soon as the stable isotope of nitrogen , N15 , became available , Schoenheimer and his colleagues applied it to an analogous study of protein metabolism . Amino acids synthesized from isotopic ammonia and added in small quantities to the diet of adult rats in nitrogen equilibrium , were found to be rapidly and extensively incorporated into the tissue proteins . Like the fatty acids , they also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isotopic amino acids or ammonia , heavy nitrogen was found in all amino acids isolated from the proteins , except lysine . Advantage was also taken of the possibility of labeling compounds with both isotopes , the ratio of which in the products isolated from the tissue proteins indicated the extent to which the carbon chain of an amino acid had followed a different metabolic pathway from that of the nitrogen atom . " As a result of Schoenheimer 's investigations . . . there has emerged a concept of metabolic regeneration , ' wherein the central idea is the continual release and uptake of chemical substances by tissues to and from a metabolic pool . ' Coincident with the cyclic processes there occur among the components of the pool , multitudinous chemical reactions of which only relatively few are concerned with elimination of waste products . " Schoenheimer in these lectures said ( page 64 ) that : " The finding of the rapid molecular regeneration , involving constant transfer of specific groups , suggests that the // biological system represents one great cycle of closely linked chemical reactions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the living being to a combustion engine nor with the theory of independent exogenous and endogenous types of metabolism . " Page 65 . " The simile of the combustion engine pictured the steady flow of fuel into a fixed system , and the conversion of this fuel into waste products . The new results imply that not only the fuel but the structural materials are in a steady state of flux . The classical picture must thus be replaced by one which takes account of the dynamic state of the body structure . . . . " A simple analogy , which may be taken as an incomplete illustration of this concept of living matter , can be drawn from a military regiment . A body of this type resembles a living adult organism in more than one respect . Its size fluctuates only within narrow limits , and it has a well-defined , highly organized structure . On the other hand , the individuals of which it is composed are continually changing . Men join up , are transferred from post to post , are promoted or broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The incoming and outgoing streams of men are numerically equal but they differ in composition . The recruits may be likened to the diet ; the retirement and death correspond to excretion . " This analogy is necessarily imperfect as it relates to only certain aspects of the dynamic state of biological structure . While it depicts the continual replacement of structural amounts , it takes no account of their chemical interactions . " The question as to the forces responsible for the arrangement of atoms in biochemical molecules in living organisms is as yet beyond the scope of laboratory experimentation . " In order to get a more or less comprehensive view of , or a satisfactory cross section of the many feeding tests which have been reported in the literature , it is necessary to refer // to a number of the published articles and to report the findings . One of the comprehensive articles often referred to by workers in this field of nutrition is one of Osborne and Mendel on " The Nutritive Value of the Wheat Kernel and its Milling Products " ( 26 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded that : " . . . the proteins of bran and embryo are superior in nutritive value to those of the endosperm , from which white flour is made , and that commercial preparations of the embryo contain a relatively large amount of the watersoluble vitamin . " The following is taken from a London letter published in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( 68 ) : r " Experiments were made with wheat flour extracted at 80% and 90% . Diet consisted of 800 grams of bread with butter plus cheese , minced or potted meat , fruit jelly , milk and sugar , tea or coffee and in one case , beer was taken as a beverage . This dietary yielded about 3,680 calories a day . The effects were remarkably uniform . Bread made from 80% flour yielded for nutrition 96.1% of the energy contained in the diet ; bread made from 90% flour , 94.5% . The loss of energy with the second bread was greater ( 5.5% ) than that from the first ( 3.9% ) . The intestinal secretions were considered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread were more bulky , and the coarser particles of this bread produced a greater stimulation of the secretion of the intestine . The increase in the bulk of the evacuation is not an evil and in the case of many is even an advantage . As to the nitrogenous constituents , the average digestibility was 89.4% in the bread from 80% flour , and 87.3% in that from the 90% extraction . Thus a greater proportion of the energy of the grains is available for human consumption when flour is milled at 90% than on the 80% // scale . The increase would extend the cereal supply of energy for the country for more than a month . Against this is to be set the loss of protein in the offal as food for pigs . " The committee referred to in the article mentioned in the preceding paragraph concluded : " That by increasing the extraction of wheat in milling from 80% to 90% , a gain in energy for man of 286,650 calories per metric ton of wheat milled would be obtained ; a gain of protein of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be secured . " A deduction has again to be made for loss of off als as food for pigs , similar to that made in the case of the gain in energy . . . . It is , however , of minor importance , because from the standpoint of national economy the gain in energy is the important matter . " The following has been reported by McCullom , Simmonds and Pitz on " The Effects of Feeding the Proteins of the Wheat Kernel at Different Planes of Intake " ( 69 ) : " In agreement with former experience with feeding diets high in their wheat content , we again have to emphasize the marked injury to the progeny which results from such restricted diets . " We have not been able to make up a ration containing wheat proteins only which was adequate for rearing of the young , although we varied the protein content from 6.5% to 47.98% . Over a wide range of protein content growth approximated the normal , but pronounced injurious effects of the ration were revealed in the reproduction records only . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markedly . " Sherman , Rouse , Allen and Woods have reported on " Growth and Reproduction upon Simplified Food Supply " ( 70 ) and state that : // " Rats at time of weaning fed on bread as a sole food stopped growing and died in six weeks . Fed bread and milk ( bread gave % and milk of the total calories ) sufficed for growth at practically normal rate but not for normal reproduction . The bread was made from patent flour with minimum of yeast , sugar , salt and lard . The same ration containing the same proportion of milk but with ground whole wheat instead of bread , the young were successfully suckled ( though at a cost of considerable weight on part of the mother ) , grew to maturity at somewhat less than average rate and in several cases have produced and successfully suckled young of the 3rd generation . When milk gave about of the total calories and the rest ground whole wheat , suckling mothers did not lose weight and young grew normally as did the young of the 3rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without affecting the results . Increased rate of growth regularly followed increases in the proportion of milk in the diet from 5% to at least 38% of the total calories in the food . " Hartwell concludes that , ( 71 ) " White bread contains sufficient vitamin B to supply the needs of a rat , both for growth and reproduction . On a diet of white bread , butter , salt mixture and water , the growth is slow , but continuous . a The slow growth is probably due to deficiency in the quality c ? r and quantity of the protein . White flour contains a little vitamin B , but the main source is the yeast . " Lapique and Chaussin ( 72 ) found little difference in the value of breads from white flour and at 85% extraction , as shown under the conditions of their experiments . Langworthy and Deuel have reported on " The Effect of Milling on the Digestibility of Graham Flour " ( 73 ) . They state that : " The amount , of protein digested varied from about 70% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bran were the // largest to 78% in the stone-burr mill and steel-burr mill flours in which the bran particles were much finer . This is what we should expect for it has been shown ( 74 ) that the bran protein is about 44% digested in the case of fine bran while it is only 28% digested in coarse bran . " The coefficient of digestibility for carbohydrate varied from 93.4% in the coarse roller mill flour to 96.8% in the stone-burr mill flour . . . . In conclusion it is fairly safe to say that the finer the bran-containing flour is ground , the more completely is it utilized by the human body . " At the beginning of their article Langworthy and Reuel give a resume of data on the digestibility of white flour , as follows : " The digestibility of patent flour is considerably higher than that of entire-wheat or Graham flours . An average ( 74 ) of 31 tests by other investigators with patent flour shows the coefficient of digestibility for the protein is 88.1% and for carbohydrate 95.7% , while an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on patent flour gave the coefficient 89.5% for the digestibility of protein and 99.9% for that of carbohydrate . An average ( 74 ) of 23 tests on the digestibility of entire-wheat flour ( 85% extrac tion ) gave the coefficient 81.9% for the protein and 94.0% for the carbohydrate , while an average of 16 tests on a similar flour by this office ( unpublished experiments ) gave the co-efficient 87.1% for the protein and 98.3% for the carbo hydrate . The average of 24 tests on true Graham flour was 76.9% for protein and 90.1% for carbohydrate and an aver-age of 33 experiments on the same flour by this office ( un published experiments ) gave the value 84.2% for protein and 94.4% for carbohydrate . " Lang , Garavelli and Nash in " A Study of the Availability of Bread Carbohydrates " ( 75 ) say that : " Dogs have been maintained in excellent condition upon exclusively bread diets for periods up to four months , with // no indication that they could not have been continued indefinitely in good nutritional state upon a diet of bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Apparent Digestibility of Carbohydrates , Fats and Indigestible Residue ' in Whole Wheat and White Breads " ( 76 ) . They summarize their experimental results as follows : " The effect of white and whole wheat breads and shredded wheat on the apparent digestibility of fat , carbohydrate and indigestible residue ' has been determined with 10 men as subjects . " The apparent digestibility of carbohydrates varied from 97.6 to 99.8% and the fat from 95.7 to 97.4% . No significant difference between the results obtained with white breads and whole wheat breads was found . " It may be concluded that under the condition of these experiments in which the diet furnished approximately adequate calories for maintenance of weight of each subject , the higher indigestible residue ' of the whole wheat products does not interfere with the digestion and absorption of carbohydrate and fat . " The indigestible residue ' exhibited an apparent digestibility of 29.2 to 76.3% . The white breads gave the higher values 68-76% , and the whole wheat products the somewhat lower values of 55 to 62% . " Holmes has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a diet without wheat flour ( 77 ) . Since Holmes gives a resume of other experimental data on digestibility of white bread and bread made from longer extraction flours , his resume is in part included herewith , since it all bears on this general topic of the nutritive characteristics of white and brown flours . " Woods and Merrill ( 78 ) conducted 13 digestion experiments with white-flour bread in which the protein was 86.4% and the carbohydrate 98.3% digested , 5 experiments with // entire wheat bread in which protein was 86.7% and the car-bohydrate 97.2% digested and 6 experiments with graham bread in which the protein was 77% and the carbohydrate 92.4% digested . In a later publication the same authors report ( 79 ) that the digestibility of white flour is 93.8% for the protein and 98.9% for the carbohydrates , that the digestibility of the entire wheat flour is 80.8% for the pro-tein and 96% for carbohydrate , and that the digestibility of graham flour is 81.3% for protein and 91.1% for carbohy-drate . " Snyder ( 80 ) gives " Snyder studied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 81 ) : " Snyder studied the digestibility of flours from wheats grown in different localities ( 82 ) . // " Since all these tests were made in the U. S. Department of Agriculture the diet was comparable and , as far as possi-ble , uniform experimental conditions were maintained , it is perhaps fair to consider all these digestion experiments as a group . The digestibility of . . . flour obtained by averag-ing the . . . above is " Considering the tests as a whole , it appears that the protein and carbohydrate are more completely assimilated from white flour than from entire wheat or graham flours , the last being the least assimilable ; or , in other words , the increasing of the amount of bran included in the flour is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in its digestibility . " Rubner ( 83 ) did somewhat similar work by studying digestibility of protein in flours containing 30% , 70% and 100% of the kernel . " Pugliese ( 84 ) conducted studies to determine the effect of milling on the digestibility of wheat flour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour containing 85% of the wheat kernel is 10% less than the digestibility of the protein of flour containing 75% of the wheat kernel . " It is sometimes contended that test periods of 3 or 4 days ' duration are too short to give reliable data regarding the dligestibility of foods . Newman and Robinson ( 85 ) who // question the accuracy of results of digestion experiments of only 3 days ' duration , studied the relative digestibility of white flour and whole meal ( flour prepared from the whole wheat kernel ) breads . . . for a period of two weeks . As a result of 4 experiments in which , with one exception , the protein of white flour was more completely digestible , they found that on an average the protein of white flour was 89.3% digested , while the protein of whole wheat was 85.9% digested . They also report that the protein of wheat meal ( 92% of the kernel ) was 76.7% as compared with a digestibility of 80.4% of the protein of another wheat meal ( 88% of the wheat kernel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine the relative digestibility of coarsely ground wheat as compared with ordinary white flour are not open to this criticism , since they were of 7 months ' duration . He found the protein of coarsely ground wheat ( bread ) eaten with margarine was 75% digestible while the protein of ordinary wheat flour eaten in a similar diet was 85% digested . In both instances the total carbohydrate was found to be practically completely digested . . . . " Holmes says that : " So far as can be learned , no studies have been made to determine the digestibility of wheat bran when eaten as a constituent of a diet which did not include the flour prepared from the remainder of the kernel . With the purpose of securing more data on the digestibility of wheat bran included in a diet from which all forms of wheat flour were excluded , 2 series of experiments were made , one with fine bran , the other with coarse bran , the subjects and experimental conditions being alike for both series . " . . . The results with fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44.7% digested and that of the bran carbohydrate 56.6% . The coarse bran gave 28% of the protein digested and 55.5% for the carbohydrate . The // result for the digestibility of fine bran protein is in agreement with the results of Pannwitz ( 87 ) who found that the protein of fine rye bran was 43.68% digested . . . . " The coefficients of digestibility of the diet as a whole ( 37% for protein , 88.5% for fat and 79.8% for carbohydrate , in the series in which fine bran was eaten , and 35.8% for protein , 93.1% for fat and 82.8% for carbohydrate , in the series in which coarse bran was eaten ) , are lower than the coefficients of digestibility , 92% for protein , 95% for fat , and 97% for carbohydrate , reported ( 88 ) for the ordinary mixed diet . This indicates the way in which the rough , relatively indigestible bran influenced the digestibility of the entire diet . It is also possible that the bran stimulated peristaltic action to such an extent that the food materials were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass through the alimentary tract without increased peristalsis . " . . . Some of the subjects found the bran diets decidedly laxative . Little , if any , difference was noted by the subjects as a whole between the laxative effects of the fine and coarse brans . " Briggs ( 89 ) has questioned a certain point in connection with Holmes ' experimental work ( 77 ) . Holmes used as his bran sample " an ordinary commercial wheat bran secured on the open market . " Briggs shows that such bran will contain not far from 15% floury material adhering to the bran . Taking this into consideration , Briggs figures that Holmes ' digestion figure for bran protein is too high and should be about 16.8% . This work of Holmes ( 77 ) has been discussed by Snyder ( 90 ) in which he brings out some of the salient points : " Some recent experiments of the U. S. Department of Agriculture , conducted . . . by Arthur D. Holmes , Specialist in charge of Digestion Experiments , Office of Home Economics , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 8 digestion trials with men fed on bran bread // in a simple mixed diet , an average of 44.7% of the bran protein was digested and 56.6% of the bran energy was available . In the case of the unground bran 28% of the protein was digested and 55.5% of the energy was available . It is to be noted that in 5 of the 16 digestion trials negative results as to the digestibility of the protein were secured ; that is , the body actually sustained a loss of protein because of the bran consumed . The reports made by the subjects regarding their physical condition vary from normal except for occasional slight pains in the stomach after eating to extreme laxative effects . ' " Mr. Holmes ' work shows that wheat bran has low digestibility as human food . . . . When used as animal food bran and wheat by-products have a much higher digestibility than when used as human food . Jordan reports on an average 77.8% of the protein of bran and 79.8% of the protein of middlings are digested by animals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time Chief Chemist of the Russell Miller Milling Company , published an article on " White Flour and Its Food Qualities " ( 91 ) . This article contains a review of the ten years of experimental work carried on in the U. S. Department of Agriculture on this subject . The following is quoted from Snyder 's report : " About 18 years ago the U. S. Department of Agriculture through its office of experiment stations inaugurated a series of tests , extending over a period of nearly 10 years , with the view of determining the relative digestibility and nutritive value of ordinary white bread , and entire-wheat and graham breads , when the flours were all made from the same wheats , which were of various types and kinds of soft and hard wheats . " The studies were made under the immediate supervision of Prof. W. O. Atwater , Chief of nutrition investigations , and Prof. Charles D. Woods . . . . A number of bulletins giving the results of the investigations were published , notaTHE // bly 67 , 101 , 126 and 156 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stations . " The published reports of the investigations cover over 300 printed pages . . . . Men of various types and following different vocations were fed on bread , and its actual digestibility was determined . " These digestion data are also discussed in an article in the Yearbook of the Department of Agriculture for 1903- " Wheat , Flour and Bread " by Harry Snyder and Charles D. Woods , from which the following is quoted : The larger number of these experiments were made with graham , entire wheat and standard patent flours from wheats from different sections of the country . The averages of the results with the three grades of flour give the following as the proportions of nutrients that were digested from the different flours , these factors being commonly termed coefficients of digestibility ; standard patent flour , protein 88.6% and carbohydrates 97.7 ; entire wheat flour , protein 82% and carbohydrates 93.5 ; graham flour , protein 74.9% and carbohydrates 89.2 . . . . " ' It will be seen that there is a considerable difference in the digestibility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protein being larger than the carbohydrates . For both nutrients the digestibility of the standard patent flour was the greatest , and that of the graham flour was least . This is true not only for the averages of the tests with the different flours , but also for the individual tests . ' " With some of the wheats the differences in the proportion digested from the different flours were not so wide as with the others ; and in some cases also there were very noticeable differences between the subjects with respect to the completeness of digestion ; but with all subjects , and with all kinds of wheats thus far tested , the uniform result was that the digestibility of the standard patent flour was the highest , that of entire wheat was next and that of graham the lowest . Concordant results were obtained in artificial digestion experiments . // " Differences in the digestibility of the flours containing the branny portion of the wheat are sometimes attributed to the fineness with which the coarse particles are ground . This is doubtless true to some extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more digestible than graham , because the whole-wheat flour is somewhat more finely ground . But even when bran is reduced to a very fine powder , it is not so well digested as flour , and its presence in the flour decreases rather than increases its nutritive value , because it decreases its digestibility . This was observed at the Minnesota Station in some experiments with Oklahoma wheats . " Bran removed in producing the patent flour was ground very fine , and was added to some of the flour , 14% as much bran as flour , or about the proportion in which it was removed during the milling . This increased the protein content of the flour to 15.3% as compared with 15.1% in the flour without the bran . The digestibility of the bread made from this mixture , as compared with that of bread made from the same flour without the bran , was as follows : Bread with bran , protein 85.9% and carbohydrates 93.3% ; bread without bran , protein 91.6% and carbohydrates 97.8% . " Thus , while the addition of bran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifle in amount , it decreased the digestibility very decidedly , so that the digestible nutrients in the flour with bran were only 13.2% of the protein and 67.5% of the carbohydrates , while in the same flour without the bran they were 13.8% of the protein and 71.1% of carbohydrates . What little was gained in increase in nutrients by the addition of bran was more than offset by the failure of the bran to be digested . " It is evident , therefore , that the defective digestibility of the bran is not due entirely to imperfect grinding , though it is worthy of note that the bread from the mixture of ordinary flour and finely ground bran was more digestible than that from either graham or entire-wheat flour front the same lot of wheat . // " . .. While the coarser grades are not more nutritious than the finer flours , there are many cases in which they are especially desirable , as , for instance , for persons of sedentary habits and occupations , because their stimulating of the alimentary tract may help to procure a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tendency to constipation . This , however , is a purely physiological action , and should be considered apart from the nutritive value . " Finally , it may be said that wheat flour of all the various grades is one of the cheapest , most digestible , and most nutritious of human foods , and well worthy of the high estimation in which it is generally held . The use of different sorts of wheat flour is a convenient way of giving variety to the diet , a matter which is of no little importance . " In summarizing the results of 56 digestion trials , extending over a period of eight years , Woods and Merrill , in U. S. Department of Agriculture , Office of Experiment Station , No. 143 , page 55 , state : In general , the digestibility of a ration , whether simply bread and milk with a little butter and sugar , or a more varied diet , was decreased when the change was made from white bread to entire-wheat bread , and still further decreased when either was replaced by graham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , the same in all three cases . The differences are sufficient to indicate that , even though graham flour contains the most and white flour the least total protein of the three , the body would obtain more protein and energy from a pound of entire-wheat than from a pound of graham flour , and still more from a pound of white flour than from a pound of either of the others . ' " . . . A long list of scientists could be given who have made investigations relative to the digestibility and nutritive value of breads , and , without exception , in favor of white bread . The objections to white bread as a food almost invariably emanate from men who have made no study of its digestibility and real value as a food , and their objections // largely rest upon assumed hypotheses as a basis , and not upon real facts . " At this point , for the better understanding of the ter minology used in some of the references which follow , it may be pointed out that , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour of 85% extraction , which is often re ferred to under the name of " National Wheatmeal. " * " National Bread " is the bread made from this product . The term " wholemeal flour " is often applied to one of 100% extraction although , unfortunately , this is not uniform . Sometimes the term " wholemeal " is followed by a statement of the degree of extraction , thus avoiding any possibility of misinterpretation . This last procedure , for example , is shown in the reference to the work which immediately fol lows . This subject of the " Comparative Digestibility of Whole-meal and White Breads and the Effect of the Degree of Fineness of Grinding on the Former " has been studied by Macrae , Hutchinson , Irwin , Bacon and McDougall ( 92 ) . Their findings are as follows : " Loaves were baked from three types of wheaten flour made from the same grist ; a straight run white flour of 73 percent extraction , a finely ground wholemeal ( 100 percent extraction ) , and a medium ground wholemeal ( 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six persons for periods of 11 ? 12 days . The daily consumption was 530 ? 630 gm. dry weight of bread and , in addition , 37 gm. mar garine , 284 cc. milk , 72 gm. marmalade jelly , and 284 cc. of mild ale . " The total energy , nitrogen , and fiber of the food con sumed and of the feces excreted over a period of 7 days were determined . Assuming that the foods other than bread // were wholly digestible , the average percentage absorption of energy , nitrogen , and fiber from the white bread was 96.1 , 91.1 , and 65.8 , respectively ; from the fine wholemeal bread it was 86.9 , 85.3 , and 14 , respectively , and from the coarser ground wholemeal 87.1 , 85.7 , and 9.7 , respectively . The nitrogen intake per 100 gm. of the wholemeal bread eaten was 2.91 ; of the white bread 2.70 gm . This advantage was , however , neutralized by the greater amount of nitrogen lost in the feces when wholemeal was taken , so that the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.49 , respectively , per 100 gm. dry weight of bread consumed . " The loss of 9 percent more of the energy of the bread in the feces from wholemeal than from white bread is largely accounted for by the undigested cell envelopes and woody fiber in the bran . The greater utilization of the fiber of the white bread is in accordance with the observations of Rubner who showed that the cell membranes of the endosperm were of different composition from those of the bran cells and were more readily attacked by bacteria in the gut . The range of individual variations in the utilization of the energy of the breads were for white bread 95.4 ? 96.8 percent and for wholemeal 85.4 ? 88.7 percent . In the utilization of nitrogen these were for white bread 88.2 ? 94.1 percent and for wholemeal 78.5 ? 89.6 percent . The same subjects showed the better utilization of both energy and nitrogen . The fineness of grinding of the wholemeal within the range used made no significant difference to the utilization of either energy or nitrogen . " Our experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the net amount of nitrogen available to the body from 1 lb. of white flour ( 73 percent extraction ) was the same as from 1 lb. of wholemeal , although the latter contained 8 percent more nitrogen than the former . The energy derived from the same weight of the white flour was about 10 percent greater , and we were unable to eat more of the wholemeal bread to compensate for this . This is a matter of some interest in considering the diets of heavy workers // under wartime restrictions . Whether , however , it is advisable to divert a quarter of the weight of the wheat berry to the feeding of animals depends on the supplies of wheat available . There is no evidence that pigs and poultry can make any better use of the offals than human beings can . " There are other facts with an important bearing upon the question of how much of the wheat berry should be reserved for human consumption apart from the digestibility of its various constituents with which our experiments have been solely concerned . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the germ and outer layers of the berry , most of which are removed in the production of white flour ( 93 ) . To what extent this is a serious detriment to consumers of white bread depends on the extent to which these vitamins are supplied by the other articles of the diet . The second is that the composition of the proteins in the portion discarded in the production of white flour is not the same as that of gliadin and glutenin ( gluten ) , the predominant proteins in the white flour , so that the proteins of the offals may exert a supplementary nutritive effect on the gluten and increase the biological value of the mixture out of all proportion to the amount added . The experiments of Osborne and Mendel ( 26 ) indicated that the improvement in biological value gained by this admixture was of the order of 20 percent , and in recent experiments Chick ( 94 ) has also shown that the biological value of the nitrogen of the specimen of whole grain used in our experiments was about 20 percent greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus 10 gm. nitrogen of this whole wheat is worth 12 gm. nitrogen of the 73 percent extraction flour made from it . The extent to which it is necessary to retain the whole or some part of the offals to supply proteins to satisfy human needs depends on the amount and nature of the proteins in the remainder of the diet . " A nutrition study has been made of the proteins of wheat bran by Murphy and Jones ( 95 ) . They state that : // " The proteins of wheat bran are characterized by their high content of the so-called nutritionally essential amino acids . The quantity of arginine and lysine in the globulin exceeds that found in most vegetable proteins which have been studied . The albumin also contains high percentages of tryptophane , tyrosine , and cystine . Taken collectively , the proteins of bran contain more than twice as much of these amino acids as are contained in the proteins of the same quantity of wheat endosperm . " Feeding experiments with albino rats have shown that the bran proteins are well utilized when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to other dietary factors than proteins , consisted of washed bran from hard , spring wheat containing no detectable quantity of embryo , and not more than 30% of the endosperm . Rats grew at an excellent rate for 15 ? 16 weeks when commercial bran ( unwashed ) constituted the only source of protein in their ration . During the first 6 weeks of the experimental period the animals gained in weight an average of 1.83 grams per gram of crude protein eaten . " When patent wheat flour supplied the sole source of protein in a similar ration , rats grew during the first 15 ? 16 weeks at a rate of only % to % of that shown by the rats receiving the bran . Their gain in weight per gram of protein eaten ( N X 5.7 ) was 0.88 gram . Although the bran ration was very efficient for the promotion of growth in young rats during the first 15 ? 16 weeks , for the subsequent 48 weeks , however , only little better than maintenance of body weight resulted . " Rats fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success in rearing them . Fecundity was low . " Macrae and his associates have reported on their experiments on " The Comparative Digestibility of White and Wholemeal Breads and the Influence to Which the Meal Is ( ; round " ( 96 ) . These results are essentially those to which reference has already been made ( 92 ) . // N. C. Wright , Director of the Hannah Dairy Research Institute , Kirkhill , Ayr , has discussed the subject of " Wholemeal Bread or Milk " ( 97 ) and says in the summary of his paper , that : " Briefly stated , the above review indicates that the adoption of the wholemeal loaf would not result in any appreciable saving in the energy content of the nation 's dietary , while it would cause a significant reduction in both the quantity and quality of protein available for human consumption . The B2 ( riboflavin ) content of the diet could be more amply supplied by converting the wheatfeed into milk via the dairy cow than by consuming the wheatfeed directly in the wholemeal loaf . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad question of the relative merits of the wholemeal flour in comparison with the equivalent quantity of white flour plus milk as sources of human nutrients and of accessory food factors . The evidence presented indicates that , when all relevant considerations are taken into account , the advantage lies with white flour plus milk . Other more technical considerations support this view . Such considerations are the improved keeping quality of the white flour , the more rapid staling ' of the wholemeal loaf ( leading to household wastage ) and finally the marked preference by the great mass of the population for white bread . At a time when palatability is a factor of great dietetic importance ( 65 ) this latter consideration can not be lightly dismissed . " The calculations on which these conclusions are based are , however , founded on two assumptions : first , that there is a serious risk that 85% extraction will be adopted for all flour used for bread-making ; and , second , that the whole of the wheatfeed thus diverted to the loaf would otherwise have been available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Digestibility of National Wheat Meal " ( 98 ) , Krebs and Mellanby say that : // " N. C. Wright ( 97 ) has recently expressed the opinion that the adoption of the wholemeal loaf would not result in any appreciable saving in the energy content of the nation 's dietary , while it would cause a significant reduction in both the quantity and the quality of protein available for human consumption . ' Wright argues that a large portion of the extra flour obtained by raising the level of the extraction in national wheatmeal from 75% to 85% can not be digested and is therefore lost ; were the extra flour fed to dairy cattle part of it would be converted into milk . His calculations are based on various assumptions , the validity of which has been discussed in detail by Bacharach ( 99 ) . " Some of these views as expressed by N. C. Wright ( 97 ) , as well as by Bacharach ( 99 ) , have been the subject of criti cism by Smith ( 100 ) and Fraenkel ( 101 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is defined as the value of " The figure for digestibility indicates the percentage of the food disappearing during the passage through the digestive tract . Digested ' food is not necessarily identical with food utilized by the body , for the former includes substances ab sorbed by the gut and excreted by the urine , and also material utilized by the bacteria of the gut . " Krebs and Mellanby summarize their findings as follows : " Six adult male volunteers were kept on a diet containing 480 ? 700 grams of national wheatmeal or white flour of 75% extraction per day . Dry weight and nitrogen content of the feces were determined . On the average 94% of the dry matter and 89% of the nitrogen of national wheatmeal was digested . In the case of white flour of 75% extraction a WHITE VERSUS BROWN FLOUR proximately 97% of the dry matter was digested . It follows from data published by McCrae and others ( 96 ) that the digestibility of white flour nitrogen is approximately 91% . " The views put forward by N. C. Wright against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of reliable data on the digestibility of the two flours were admittedly provisional ) are not substantiated by the new data . The difference in the digestibility of the two flours is much smaller than was assumed by Wright . " Moran and Pace have discussed " The Digestibility of High-Extraction Wheatmeals ( 102 ) . " The following data are found in this article : " . . . it is usually the practice to make the rate of extraction the basis for comparison of the results of different investigators . . . . In this article we wish to emphasize that in digestibility experiments or calculations on wheatmeals the practice of making the rate of extraction the basis of comparison is fundamentally unsound and may give rise to misleading results and deductions even though the experimental technique of the test meals , etc. , is completely satisfactory . At a given extraction , the digestibility must depend also on the composition of the wheat grist , the conditioning of the wheat and the method of milling . " . . . There seems little doubt , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on whole meal ( 96 ) , that decrease in digestibility in passing from white flour to high extraction meals is due to the presence of bran or bran layers rich in indigestible fibrous materials . The pericarp or beeswing contains the most fibre ? 2 determinations gave figures of 21 and 23% against 14% for pure bran ? it is the presence of this factor either alone or in bran , which is mainly responsible for the lower digestibility of high extraction meals . " Our experience with National Wheatmeal shows that the bulk of the contained bran particles are substantially full bran including the alcurone layer . // " On the basis that the fall in digestibility is proportional to the fibre content it is possible to calculate the theoretical digestibility figures for wholemeals of different fibre contents . The wholemeal used by Macrae et al had a fibre content ( reckoned on a 15% moisture basis ) of 1.80% and a digesti bility of 96% . On the assumption given above it follows that each increase of 0.2 in fibre content ( above 0.15 ) leads to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this basis are shown . . . . " The only figure available for checking this is that of Krebs and Mellanby ( 98 ) , who found a digestibility of 94% for an 85% extraction meal which had a fibre content of 0.45 . In the above table a meal of this fibre content has a calculated digestibility of 94.4 . ' Theoretical calculations are also given by Moran and Pace for the digestibility of pure bran . N. C. Wright has further discussed the " Digestibility of National Wheatmeal " ( 103 ) and states in his summary that : " The results recorded by Krebs and Mellanby ( 98 ) for the digestibility of national wheatmeal are open to criticism . " The collected results of earlier workers is reviewed , and the following mean values for protein digestibility adduced : white flour 86% ; national wheatmeal 81% . For energy di gestibility mean values are : white flour 92% ; national wheatmeal 88% . For protein content : white flour 12% ; national wheatmeal 12.35% . For energy content : white flour and national wheatmeal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these figures , the annual losses of nutrients resulting from the adoption of the national wheatmeal loaf // amount to over 60,000 tons of protein and over 1,600,000 calories ; adoption of the wholemeal loaf would more than double these losses . " M. D. Wright has discussed " The Nutritive Value of Bread . Fortified White Flour and National Wheatmeal Compared " ( 104 ) . She has the following to say : " Despite the importance of estimating the relative nutritive values of the two alternative wartime flours ? national wheatmeal of 85% extraction and white flours of 75% extraction fortified with vitamin B1 ? experimental work on the subject is not yet extensive . Wholemeal bread , with its higher content of vitamin B2 complex , of vitamin E , and of iron , would appear from a nutritive point of view to have definite advantages . " H. Chick ( 105 ) , describing an experiment in which the two flours were compared by the growth response of young rats , concluded that the advantage lies with wholemeal flour . She summarizes her findings as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraction ) tested on young growing rats has been found inferior to that of wholemeal flour ( 82% extraction ) , even when the defects of the former protein , minerals , and vitamin Bl have been corrected . The inferiority must be attributed to lack of B2 vitamins . ' " In criticism of Chick 's work , Wright says that " the differential intake of protein for the first and second weeks can have been due to nothing more than the inacceptability of the white bread diet to the rat palate . The effect of such a wide difference in protein intake , in a growth-rate experiment designed to be crucial as to the relative value of the diets in other respects , is fundamental . " Other debatable points in Chick 's work are also referred to . Wright then carried on her experiments to overcome points mentioned with respect to Chick 's work , using , however , a // 75% extraction ( not 73% as used by Chick ) , the 75% extraction fortified with 0.2 gram of aneurin ( B1 ) per 280 pound sack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " used in England . Wright 's first set of experiments showed that , " There is no significant difference in gains in weight made by the two groups of animals . The average growth rate is about seventenths of the normal for rats of this strain on an unrestricted intake of their adequate stock diet , which is what would be expected having regard to the restriction of food intake in the present test . " When the experiment just described was being planned it was thought that if its results should show a definite difference between the nutritive values of the two flours , it might still be held that this would lose its significance when considering the application to human diets , since man consumes a range of food not commonly used in laboratory experiments . Concurrently with the first experiment , a second was therefore planned to see how rats would thrive on the same two flours when these were baked into bread and used as a percentage of an ordinary human mixed diet . " In the present test . . . the animals grew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increments of the two experimental groups shows that between the ages of four and eight weeks , rat growth appears to be equally well supported by wheatmeal of 85% extraction or by white flour of 75% extraction fortified with vitamin Bl , when these are mixed with the staple foods into the diets previously described . " Although we have used considerably more animals than did Dr. Chick and aimed at a stricter control of the other dietary factors that may effect growth , our findings that wheatmeal bread from flour of 85% extraction and white bread from flour of 75% extraction ? fortified in the manner described ? do not differ markedly in nutritive value , contrast with Dr. Chick 's statement that wholemeal flour of // 82% extraction is superior to white flour of 73% extraction corrected for its deficiency of protein , minerals and vitamin Bl . " A more refined statistical analysis than is possible to give here somewhat weakens the apparent superiority of the white-flour diet in the first experiment and somewhat strengthens that of the wholemeal diet in the second , but in both cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hartwell has likewise carried on " An Experimental Study of Brown and White Bread in the Diet of the Rat " ( 106 ) and concluded that : " 1 ? The rate of growth of young rats on a diet of bread ( brown or white ) , butter and salt mixture is slow . " 2 ? Male rats grow more rapidly on brown bread than on white . Female rats grow equally slowly on either kind of bread . " 3 ? For gestation and lactation , brown and white bread appear to be equal . With both diets , the litters are poor weight at birth , and only a few young are weaned . " The author says . . . " from a common-sense basis there seems little reason to accept the superiority of brown over white bread . ... " The brown bread referred to in this author 's experiments was made from pure wheatmeal , from which a portion of the endosperm but not the germ had been removed . " It was therefore stronger in the supposedly good elements of protein and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chick and Work studied the " Nutritive Value of the Combined Proteins of Flours of Different Degrees of Extraction of the Wheat Grain " ( 107 ) . In this report it is stated that : // " For each experiment the different flours investigated were derived from the same sample of wheat and were provided by the Research Association of British Flour Millers . Groups of young rats shortly after weaning were maintained on diets of which all the nitrogen was supplied by the flour investigated ; small amounts of fat and salt mixture were added , also vitamin A and D as codliver oil and B vitamins as a protein-free yeast extract . The intake of food and of nitrogen was measured , also the dry weight and nitrogen of feces passed . The criterion taken for nutritive value of the protein fed was the grams ' gain in body weight per gram protein digested . " In one experiment with diets containing 13% protein the average value of the above expression for an 8-week period was 1.40 and 1.82 for rats consuming the white flour ( 73% extraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater by 30% for proteins of the latter . This superiority was confirmed in a converse experiment in which a slightly inferior rate of growth was shown by a group of rats consuming a diet containing 16% white flour proteins as compared with a group receiving 12% wholemeal proteins in their diet . " Flour of 85% extraction ( National Wheatmeal ) gave an intermediate value for its proteins . In an experiment with diets containing 12.5% protein extending over five weeks , the gain in weight per gram protein digested for groups of rats receiving diets composed of white ( 75% extraction ) , national wheatmeal and whole meal flours was 1.6 , 2.0 and 2.1% respectively . The digestibility ' ( proportion of the ingested nitrogen available to the animal ) of the three flours was 89 , 86 and 89% respectively . " R. O. Neumann has carried on experiments on both animals and man , to obtain data on the retention of nitrogen , carbohydrates , fat , etc. , using flours of different degrees of extraction ( 108 ) . Neumann was a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Govern94 WHITE VERSUS BROWN FLOUR ment Institute of Hygiene . His findings are here presented in tabular form : His findings indicate a lowering in the retention of nitro gen , carbohydrates and ash , with increase in the length of the extraction , while there is small difference with respect to the fat . The percentage of available calories likewise de-creases with the increase in extraction . Palmer of the Research Laboratory of Hovis , Ltd. , Lon-don , has worked on " The Nutritive Value of Wheaten Products " ( 109 ) and found that : " On a diet composed entirely of wheat cereals , namely flour and germ , a vigorous strain of rats will grow progres sively , reach sexual maturity , remain in good health for many months and will breed , provided that the unfavorably low Ca/P ratio of this diet has been corrected by the addi tion of calcium lactate in such amounts as to produce a Ca/P ratio of 1 : 0.5 . On such a diet some rats have been kept alive for a year or more . If the Ca/P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month only and then ceases and all the animals die within 3 ? 4 months . " The addition of calcium chloride or calcium carbonate does not give such good results , whilst calcium citrate is as effective as calcium lactate . " These results show that the nutritive value of the wheaten cereal mixture used in these experiments is very high . The proteins of wheaten cereals have , therefore , a much higher biological value than has been attributed to them hitherto . The cereal mixture contains a potential supply of vitamin A in the form of carotene , but the amount is not sufficient to afford complete protection when the diet is given over long periods . . . . Using rats as test objects , // the main defects of cereals is the low amount of calcium and probably also of iodine . When this is corrected the mineral content is adequate . " In a diet composed of natural foodstuffs , the main nutritional defects of cereals are corrected by the addition of milk and its products , butter and cheese . Milk and cheese are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Milk and its products represent , therefore , the rational dietetic complement to cereals , while the combination of meat with cereals is of doubtful nutritive value , since it aggravates the disproportion of calcium and phosphorus . For the human dietary , which requires an extraneous supply of vitamin C , the inclusion of foodstuffs rich in vitamin C ? vegetables and fruits ? are required . " In Palmer 's work just described , a mixture of 3 parts of flour , 1 part of germ , plus 3% of calcium lactate , was used . " The Comparative Nutritional Value of White and Whole Wheat Flour " has been studied by Moore and Brodie ( 110 ) . They state that : " It is impossible to obtain in the market a standard 100% whole wheat bread , as most bakers , even in making so-called whole wheat bread , ' do not incorporate a high or even a constant percentage of whole wheat flour . Many bakers use a commercial graham flour which is a combination of bran and shorts and other by-products from the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the ground whole wheat . In their summary they state that : " 1 ? White mice on a properly balanced diet containing whole wheat flour increased four times as rapidly as did their brothers on a chemically identical diet in which whole wheat was replaced by white flour . " 2 ? Whole wheat improves the appetite so that the mice receiving it consumed twice the food eaten by those on white flour . // " 3 ? The gain in weight per unit of food consumed was doubled by using the whole wheat . " 4 ? From the standpoint of health and life , whole wheat is incomparably superior . 1 The mice on it were healthy , happy and contented . Many of those on white flour developed paralysis and three died . " 5 ? Those on whole-wheat had much greater resistance to cold weather . " 6 ? The fur of the white flour group became clumped and abnormally oily . " 7 ? When white flour mice were given the whole wheat diet , they rapidly gained weight , their fur became normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as negative proof of the superiority of whole wheat . " 8 ? The dietary difference between white and whole wheat flours is largely a difference in Vitamin B. Modern milling removes this necessary food factor . " 9 ? This experiment demonstrated that the cost of food per gram of weight gained was 4.9 ? on a diet containing white flour and 3.7 ? on one containing whole wheat . For nu tritional purposes , whole wheat flour is worth nearly twice as much as white flour . " The presentation of facts such as these to parents and teachers wins their support to scientific feeding and will lead , we trust , to healthier and happier future generations . " Hale of the Harvard Medical School has discussed " The Role of Bread in Nutrition " ( 111 ) and quotes from Holt 's " Food , Health and Disease , " 1922 , to the effect that : " There are some children the largest item of whose diet is bread . There are numbers of children whose only breakfast is bread and coffee . " Hale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mendel ( 26 ) and to that of Sherman , Rouse , Allen and Woods ( 70 ) and states further that : // + " As affecting mankind , in Labrador and Newfoundland , beriberi , a nutritional disease , was unknown when bread was made of whole wheat flour , but with the introduction of white flour it became a frequent disease , similar symptoms of undernourishment appeared , on a much larger scale , among the British , who used white bread , but not among the Indian troops , whose bread was from coarse whole wheat flour . " Hale further says that feeding experiments made on rats and mice and children seemed to show the better results from longer extraction flours than from ordinary white flour , and the advantage of added milk products . Apropos of beriberi , mentioned by Hale , this subject has been discussed by Little under the caption of " Beriberi Caused by Fine White Flour " ( 112 ) . He gives some clinical observations made during five years in Newfoundland and Labrador , where beriberi is fairly common . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A great many people live from hand to mouth , being always on the verge of poverty . There are many who are well satisfied if they have enough flour , tea and molasses to see them through the winter . . . . " Voegtlin , Sullivan and Meyers have made a somewhat parallel suggestion as to the use of highly milled cereals and other foods , with respect to the incidence of pellagra in the south ( 113 ) . They suggest the possibility that the decrease in the south of the use of eggs , fresh milk and meats and in-crease in the use of highly milled cereals and the use of baking soda may play an important role in the incidence of pellagra in the south , due to the decrease in the vitamin content in the diet . " The Brown vs . White Bread Controversy " is the title to : in article written by Hartwell and Mottram . The latter is Professor of Physiology in the University of London ( 114 ) . These authors give a general discussion of white vs. brown // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the authors say with respect to white bread , brown bread , and white bread plus wheat germ : " It is very difficult arguing from these data to assay the value of these three types of bread on human nutrition ; in fact it may be said at once that nothing but experiments made upon human beings will be satisfactory or acceptable to either group of protagonists ? long and costly experiments on the lines of those made under the auspices of the Medical Research Council and Ministry of Health by Dr. Corry Mann ( Medical Research Council Special Report 105 ) upon the value in nutrition of milk . " These authors of this article conclude , after experiments on rats , that : " The substitution of brown bread for white in a diet made up to approximate that of the Essex agricultural labourer , when fed , in carefully controlled experiments , to the laboratory rat , resulted in but small increase in growth and was accompanied by physical and nervous symptoms and by habits pointing towards a lack of , or imbalance between , food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but little support to the propaganda for brown bread in the diet of the working classes . " Hoffman of the Ward Baking Company has discussed the " Reproduction of Animals on an Exclusive Diet of Bread " ( 115 ) . His experimental data refer to feeding tests of a loaf called " Vitovim , " containing what was supposed to be all the necessary elements for growth and reproduction and the rearing of young ? a so-called " superloaf . " Feeding tests showed its superior qualities . In an article by Wood entitled " Less Refined Bread Not Helpful " ( 116 ) , he makes the following observations on the relative calorie values of white and brown flours : // " From . . . investigations carried out in Cambridge before the War it appears that 96% of the calories contained in bread made from patents ' flour are digestible as compared with only 90% in the case of bread made from stone-ground flour from which only about 12% of bran had been sifted . . . . Applying these factors to the gross calorie values of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread made from patents ' flour yields to the human body 1222 calories per pound , whilst the less digestible bread made from lowgrade flour yields per pound only 995 calories . These figures , since they apply accurately only to the actual samples tested , may well be rounded off , and a good-class white bread , containing about 35% of water , may be credited with 1200 available calories per pound , as against 1000 calories per pound in the darker , moister bread , containing about 40% water , which is baked from flour from which only the coarser parts of the husk have been sifted in milling . " Copping , of the Division of Nutrition , Lister Institute , London , has reviewed the methods in use for determining the nutritive value of flour and bread , with reference to 79 articles which have appeared in the literature ( 117 ) . In conclusion , she says that : " If one sums up the evidence which has been collected in the course of this review , it is quite clear that the change over from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel roller mills were introduced nearly 70 years ago , has resulted in reduction of the nutritive value of the protein , in serious lowering of the content of calcium , phosphorus and iron , in reduction of the vitamin Bl and vitamin B2 complex content , and carotene content and probably in complete removal of the vitamin E , all representing dead loss nutritionally . In order to change back to wholemeal it is necessary to alter the tastes of the people and to overcome the vested interests in the existing milling industry , and to find a means of using wholemeal flour more quickly and of storir , g it more
