txt roll call for the powers to record their yea or nay before the world as to whether they are willing to disarm now and depend in full faith upon a newly sinewed United Nations was demanded today in the Senate . Senator Millard E. Tydings of Maryland , ranking Democratic member of the Committee on the Armed Services , in a major foreign policy speech asked the Senate to give President Truman a mandate to call such a world disarmament conference . The issue , he asserted , was greater than the Greek-Turkish ( crisis and greater than any before the world . What the United States now must insist upon , he declared in substance , was a clear choice between great alternatives . Money , Force Now Lacking One would be all-out disarmament among the nations , with the Security Council itself at the . game time to be strongly armed to keep and patrol the peace thus collectively entrusted . The other would be all-out preparation in this country for all eventualities . Senator Tydings declared that the United Nations as presently constituted was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing I more or less than a glorified debating society " that in its present lack of power might become " the most sad and colossal failure " of aistory . Reintroducing in an atmosphere ) f fresh crisis an unsuccessful res ) lution of last session for a conerence aimed at world disarmament by Jan. 1 , 1950 , Mr. Tydings argued that only through such a Ieparate mechanism was there a chance of achieving the objective . The United Nations , he contended , was not now equipped even to " initiate " with hope of success " a task of this magnitude . " In an address received with grave attentiveness , Senator Tydings anticipated and conceded skepticism as to the willingness of all the powers to agree to disarmament and observed that some might not be willing to accept international inspection of arms . Would Point Out Objectors But even such abstentions , he contended , would be negatively valuable , if in a melancholy way , to this country in suggesting what must be done in the future for its individual security . " It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if the President invites the great nations to a conference they may not come . Very well , that 's what we want to know . Then we will know we can not rely on the United Nations to keep peace . This would mean that hope of world coordination for peace had vanished . " If the conference fails , at least we shall have information vital to this nation , and in that event we can legislate with clarity our own future course . We ca n't have disarmament without international inspection , but if inspection is rejected we shall know who has blocked it . " Senator Tydings stressed his belief that atomic disarmament was receiving misplaced emphasis , arguing that the debate in that connection was largely academic without total disarmament . For , he declared , " treaty or no treaty , " the atomic bomb would certainly be used in any future war , and thus the thing to fear was not the atomic bomb but war itself . " What we must control , " he added , " is not the atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to make war . In short , we must control ourselves , and the people of all the other nations must do likewise . " He struck out at any individual disarmament , or " disarmament by example " of this country alone . " As an American , " he said , " I believe we ought to do one thing or the other . The United States must either keep fully prepared in all categories , including the atomic bomb , or we must have total disarmament , including the atomic bomb , for all nations of the globe , ourselves included. ? " What we and all other nations want and are entitled to have is a clear answer as to which of these policies we must all hereafter pursue for our own protection . If we are going to support the United Nations , then all nations should be willing to disarm . If we are not going to put our faith in the United Nations , then it is imperative for our own national security that we never again be caught unprepared . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 lines " In the present world situation , wall nations continue to straddle . They rely half on the United Nations to settle international disputes and half on their own mighty armaments  --  just in case . If the world continues to straddle , all is lost . " The time has come for world disarmament . Unless it comes we , too , must always be fully prepared . We must have the biggest army and navy and air force in the'world , more atomic bombs , and the men and weapons which will insure their quick use in our hour of need . We must pay the crushing taxes . We must have universal military training . We must reduce our scale of living in order to do this . We must submit to unbelievable regimentation . We must be prepared in a world that is armed to the teeth . " Without world disarmament we must be prepared , United Nations or no United Nations , to spring instantly to our country 's defense . " Senator Tydings , closing with a gloomy declaration that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was felicitated on the floor by half a dozen Senators , including Senator Tom Connally of Texas , ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee , who went up to shake his hand .
