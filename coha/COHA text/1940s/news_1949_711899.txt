txt Bishop James P. De Wolfe of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Long Island officially removed the Rev. Dr. John Howard Melish yesterday from the rectorship of Holy Trinity Church , ' Brooklyn , a post the 74-year-old clergyman has held for fortyfive years . The removal order is effective April 4 . By terminating . Dr. Melish'spas-torate , the Bishop automatically ends the tenure of the Rev. , William Howard Melish , the rector 's son and assistant . Tfie younger Melish , who is chairman of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship , an organization listed as subversive by Attorney General Tom Clark , has been at odds with the vestry of Holy Trinity for nearly a year . Text of Bishop De Wolfe 's statements on Page 11 . On Jan. 21 the church 's lay governing body , by a vote of 9 to 1 , formally petitioned . Bishop De Wolfe to terminate Dr. Melish 's pastorate because of his avowed approval of the " outside activities " of his son . At the same time the vestry held that because of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties . The Bishop 's decision , released by his public relations representative , Robert Lee , requires the vestry to pay Dr. Melish , hi quarterly installments , a sum equal to the pension he is regularly entitled to receive from the Church Pension Fund . This will , in effect , amount to a " double pension . " A supplementary statement issued by Bishop De Wolfe in conjunction with his decision stated his belief that the assistant rector was " most mistaken in what he supposes to be the pastoral application of his ministry . " Asserting that he had twice asked both of the Melishes to resign voluntarily , the Bishop emphasized that the issues in the case were " essentially pastoral . " Dissension within Holy Trinity parish , said the Bishop 's statement , was occasioned by the rector 's " failure to bring about the resignation ' or removal of the assistant minister whose ' outside- activities ' have been most detrimental to the welfare of the parish . " In pursuing those activities , the statement continued , Mr. Melish has been " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his standing as a private American citizen . " Questions Effect on Cpurch The Bishop 's statement further questioned the effect on the church as a whole or the younger minister 's association with " reputed atheists , Communists , agitators of world - revolution , totalitarians and almost every article which denies the Christian doctrine . " Each step in the removal proceedings , said the Bishop , has been " canonical , legal and orderly . " In describing his " approach " to the case , Bishop De Wolfe added : " My sustained prayer has been for Divine guidance and enlightenment so that the judgment eventually to be given might be that which would serve the best interests of the whole church . " Bishop De Wolfe was guided in his decision by a report prepared by the diocesan standing committee , composed of four laymen and four clergymen . This committee held two closed hearings at Garden City , L. I. , last month to determine " what advice and counsel " should be . given the bishop . At its first , session the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the - case until April 18 , when the annual parish elections are scheduled to be held . It was Dr. Melish 's contention that on that date a new vestry would be elected , which , he hoped , might reverse the original petition of the lay governing body . The report of the standing committee , which became available last night , quoted from an address made by the Archbishop of Canterbury on Jan. 13 , unequivocally pointing out the incompatibility of Christianity and communism . The report then enumerated past associations and writings of the younger Melish . The text of that portion of the report follows : ' " He does not deny the statement on behalf of the vestry that in July , 1943 , he wrote a pro-Communist and pro-Soviet article in The Churchman unofficial Episcopal periodical entitled ' Religion and Anti-Soviet Propaganda ; that in January , 1944 , he addressed a letter to The Daily Worker on the occasion of its twentieth anniversary .
