No. 1 killer of U.S. babies is whooping cough , which takes a heavier toll than scarlet fever , diphtheria , measles and infantile paralysis combined . Last week , doctors at the American Medical Association meeting in Atlantic City heard reports on 1 ) a new way to prevent the disease in newborn infants ; 2 ) the serious mental effects of whooping cough . <P> Prenatal Vaccination . Newborn infants have a natural immunity to many infectious diseases , but they can not be vaccinated against whooping cough before the age of seven months . Apparent reason : their bodies are incapable of producing the antibodies . <P> Drs . Philip Cohen and Samuel Jerome Scadron of Manhattan told how they solved this grave problem by vaccinating 200 mothers in the fifth or sixth month of pregnancy . About 150 billion whooping-cough germs were given to the mothers in injections at two-week intervals . The mothers developed antibodies in their blood streams , passed them on through the umbilical cord to their babies . The inoculations had no effect upon pregnancy or delivery . <P> Damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Louis Aryan Lurie and Sol Levy studied 58 children aged ten and eleven , who had come down with whooping cough in early infancy . Of these children , 34 , or more than 58% , showed definite changes in behavior , personality and intelligence later in life-apparently , said the doctors , " as a direct result of this infection . " <P> A " striking and characteristic finding " in these children was a delay in walking and talking ; some of them had already started , but stopped after they had whooping cough . Others had convulsions , deafness , speech defects , subnormal intelligence . The incidence of mental deficiency , said the doctors , was much larger in this group of children than in the entire home .
