txt Letters KENNETH W. PORTEJOSEPH LEAV.M KAYE . pg . 78 Letters ADDENDUM TO THE EDITOR : Meyer Berger 's article , " Mother Truman  --  Portrait of a Rebel , " speaks of the burning of " Mother Truman 's " father 's barns and the slaughter of 400 of his Hampshire hogs by " Jim Lane 's Kansas Red-legs " in 1861 . " She ( Mother Truman ) , " your author continues , " recalls with live satisfaction how Quantrill 's Raiders thundered into Kansas two years later and repaid the Jayhawkers in kind . " He does not specify , however , that this payment " in kind " for the slaughter of the . 400 Hampshire hogs was the murder of over 140 unarmed men and boys in Lawrence , Kan . This , I think , would be a significant and , indeed , an indispensable touch to his " portrait of a rebel . " KENNETH W. PORTER . Poughkeepsie , N. Y. rOOTBELI.I . TO THE EDITOR : The article , " New Patterns of Life for the Aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of increasing , dimensions , but generally ignored . Already " most homes for the The hands of the old . aged , both private and public , have staggering waiting lists . " Must we wait until we are overwhelmed and seek the answer in a political football or could we now have a complete investigation , study and solution which will meet the issue fully , now and for the future ? JOSEPH LEAV . New York . GOING HOME TO THE EDITOR : Edward Hall 's article on the obnoxious things about New York was not very complete . He neglected something which this city , alone of all others , can offer on its transportation lines . New Yorkers rush so much that the first thing they neglect is politeness . As I was - told by a man who has worked for the transportation system for many years , we live like a bunch of " gophers , " going in and out of the ground all day . I 'm not a native of this live fantasia , and I 've had enough . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance can pause to say hello . M. KAYE . New York .
