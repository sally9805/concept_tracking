In the great hall of Luna Park , Buenos Aires ' Madison Square Garden , 30,000 Argentines gathered this week to voice friendship for the U.S. on the first anniversary of Pearl Harbor . <P> This sentiment might well have been heeded long since by President Ramon S. Castillo . He had had concrete evidence of Nazi espionage within his country when a Gestapo agent and " diplomat , " Gottfried Sandstede escaped ( TIME , Sept. 8 , 1941 ) . As Argentines gathered on Pearl Harbor Day , he had more evidence , again pointing directly to Buenos Aires ' German Embassy . <P> Federal police , acting at last on information documented in a U.S. State Department memorandum , grabbed 38 suspected Nazi agents . The catch included a deep-sea diver who had volunteered to attach time bombs to the keels of Allied ships in Buenos Aires harbor . His activities and those of other agents , including a Swiss and Paraguayan , pointed to the German Embassy , and in particular to Naval Attach Captain Dietrich Niebuhr . <P> Evidence in preliminary court hearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the known sinking of at least two British cargo ships . Probably scores of others were doomed by code messages on high-powered radio sets and interchange of information through Spanish ships . Subsequent developments were expected to give chapter &; verse on a continental espionage system of Nazis , Fascists and Japanese operating in Buenos Aires with all the trigger men expelled from Brazil and Chile . <P> To press the charges against the German diplomats , the case was placed in the hands of the Supreme Court , which alone can take action against persons shielded by diplomatic immunity . If evidence is sufficient , the Foreign Ministry , in Argentine procedure , will ask the Embassy if the accused agree to trial . If they refuse , their guilt is taken for granted , and they will be stripped of their immunity and subject to arrest . To escape this , they could take refuge in the extraterritorial safety of the Embassy , or flee . <P> When Gottfried Sandstede fled , the Argentines were hopping mad . That was before Pearl Harbor , before their ships were sunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sumner Welles of harboring Axis spies . The public at that time demanded the ousting of Nazi Ambassador Baron Edmund von Thermann . What might happen this time , if events followed a similar course , was anybody 's guess . But it was clear that , as they already had in Chile ( TIME , Nov. 16 ) , the words of Sumner Welles were bearing overripe fruit in Argentina . <P> In Chile , which for some time has been reported to be , on the verge of a break with the Axis , President Juan Antonio Rios marked the Pearl Harbor anniversary with a message to President Roosevelt and the U.S. : " My country will be at the side of the democracies , defending the ideals of liberty and justice .
