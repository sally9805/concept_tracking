txt Another Important Absentee The reader who brought out the fact in last Saturday 's TIMES that I two important conferences , namely the Big Ten and the Eastern Ivy League , are unrepresented in the Madison Square Garden basketball program this season neglected to mention another important group that was similarly overlooked . That is the Southeastern Conference . This league may be a little off the main circuit as far as basketball is concerned but it certainly does qualify as a major conference and its leading teams compare favorably with the best in other sections . For instance , Tennessee , the 1940-41 Southeastern Conference champion , showed its quality by defeating Long Island University in the Sugar Bowl game the other night and Kentucky has stood up well over the years in intersectional competition . TRANSPLANTED SOUTHERNER . New York , Dec. 31 , 1941.
