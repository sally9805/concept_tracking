ri-lowARD the end of 1935 we received what I we considered a remarkable manuscript called " Aerobatics , Thirty Minutes , " telling what it looked like and felt like to go through aerial maneuvers as an Army pilot . The author was Beirne Lay , Jr. , who had gone right into the Army Air Corps after his graduation from Yale . During the next two or three years we ran two other articles of his ? one of them an account of parachuting out of a disabled bomber into Chesapeake Bay ? and these led to Lieutenant Lay 's writing a hook for Harper Brothers called I Wanted Wings . Now we are glad to welcome him back as Lieutenant Colonel Lay , with " What I t Takes to Bomb Germany , " written out of direct personal experience . Colonel Lay is thirty-four years old . He was born in West Virginia and educated at Yale . In 1933 he graduated from Randolph and Kelly Fields and was commissioned Second Lieutenant , Air Corps Reserve . Between 1933 and 1939 he served for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Corps in bombardment and pursuit , with experience between tours of duty as Managing Editor of Sportsman Pilot and as a free-lance writer .

On July 5 , 1941 , he was ordered to active duty . On February 4 , 1943 , he went to England as one of the six original officers who accompanied General Ira C. Eaker . There , he says , " I watched the 8th Air Force grow froma sheet of paper . " In August , 1943 , he reported for three weeks ' temporary duty with a Fortress Group , of which one week was spent on the ground in North Africa . lie started on six combat missions and completed four , checking out as a Fortress pilot .

DETROIT RIOT RE we going to have a recurrence of the race riots which came with the last war ? Numerous communities in the country are apprehensive . Collier 's for September 18th published an article by Walter Davenport called " Race Riots Coming . " There had already been blow-ups in Mobile , in Beau-mont , Texas , and in Alexandria , Louisiana , before the riot in Detroit . The strange thing about these bloody affairs is that they are expected and nothing is done to prevent them . In Mobile there occurred a most re-markable incident . A judge gave a man a suspended sentence on a charge of inciting to riot . For challenging such a procedure the editor of the Mobile Register was held in contempt of court until a higher judge voided the action .

" cam Enid Griffis 's " He Runs a Hotel " is the first of a series by various authors on everyday life in wartime in terms of the experience of actual individuals . The piece has a peculiar interest because it 's about a hotelkeeper , and there 's no juicier subject than hotelkeeping . When the American hotelkeeper is good at his job he is very good indeed and the whole establishment reflects his talents ; but hotels can be efficiently organized and yet be run mechanically and be hopelessly dull and dreary .

Shepherd 's Inn is one of the inns of fable that delight the novelist and seldom appear in real life . The biscuits and the ham at Shepherd 's used to be poetry .

His belief in his inn was fierce and belligerent . One night a salesman who was a stranger to the place arrived and was given a room . Not knowing that the inn had a dining room , he rose early the next morning and went elsewhere for his breakfast . Business over , he came back to the inn , packed his hag , and then went up to Shepherd , who was standing on the front porch , " What do I owe you ? " he asked . " Not a cent , " said Shepherd sourly . " Why not ? " asked the salesman in astonishment .

JAPANESEAMERRICANS EATERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our Japanese-American citizens , published in Harper 's during the past year . will be interested in this letter : As a member of the Washington bureau of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin , I have just spent a week with the 442nd ( Go for Broke ) Combat Team at Camp Shelby , Mississippi . The 442nd , as you know , is composed of American citizens of Japanese ancestry from Hawaii and the United States mainland . What I saw and heard at Camp Shelby provides , in my opinion , the sequel to the article written by Li . Comdr . C. II . Coggins and published in the June issue of your magazine . From Commander Coggins your readers learned how the Combat Team came into being . I am sure they would be no less interested in knowing how it is acquitting itself and how it seems to be stacking up as a unit headed for battle . Considerable evidence is already available . Before I left for Camp Shelby , the War Department told me that the 442nd apparently has the highest IQ of any unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are manifest . Caucasian officers of the 442nd , including regulars who have made the service a lifetime progression told me repeatedly that the Combat Team has advanced more rapidly in training than any other army unit they have ever seen . A great deal is involved in the future record of the 442nd . The men are fully conscious of that , as I know at first hand . They feel that their whole future , and the future of their children , is bound up in the way they acquit themselves . They feel that the American uniform and the battlefield afford them an opportunity to prove themselves as American citizens . The international implications are considerable , particularly in the value a brilliant combat record would have as material to throw back at Tokyo over the radio . The foreign service of the OWI is prepared to exploit any such developments . I can even see how the record of the 442nd might have a bearing on postwar adjustments in the Far East . The spirit of the men is high . They are eager to get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not sure that battle will be their most difficult task . They face the corroding influences of ignorance and misunderstanding . A mistake made by any one of their number reflects back instantly and inevitably on the Combat Team as a whole . That is true to the same extent of no other unit in the army . Fortunately , they give every indication of a healthy mental outlook . They do not go around with the appearance of persons carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders . They are a high spirited , cheerful lot , who delight in beer , sports , and a good time . Even though they bear responsibilities beyond their years and beyond the lot of many another soldier , they do n't take themselves too seriously . During my week 's visit at Camp Shelby I watched the Combat Team in field training and at leisure , talked with scores of men , with many of their junior officers , with all of their senior officers , and with their doctors and chaplain . I talked with a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to learn something about the acceptance of the men in that Mississippi community . The whole experiment is based on the premise that these men are different from their ancestors . ' They are products of American public schools and an American environment . To anyone who knows them , who has seen them training as soldiers , and who has obtained the opinion of their officers , there is every indication they will acquit themselves as Americans , with honor to the uniform , and with a potential effect in psychological warfare against the enemy that will extend far beyond their accomplishments on the battlefield . JOHN B. TERRY RADERS will remember that last April we ran a story by John Bartlow Martin called " The Making of a Nazi Saboteur . " The article was about Herbert Haupt , one of the eight saboteurs who were landed from submarines in Florida and Long Island . The spies were tried in secret before a military commission in Washington , Later there was a public trial in Chicago of six people who had sheltered and aided young Haupt . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penitentiary and each was to pay a fine of ten thousand dollars . The three men were sentenced to death in the electric chair . Pending an appeal , a stay of execution was granted . Mr. Martin now writes to us that the Haupt convictions have been upset by the Circuit Court of Appeals and that new trials are in
