The Big Four 's Foreign Ministers met in Paris last week . They met for what Paris ' Figaro somewhat extravagantly said would " once and for all ... settle or unsettle the peace of mind of men in every street in every capital of the world . " The French greeted their guests with culinary reminders of what the man in the street was up against . The British delegates faced a dinner of cauliflower , spinach and ice cream .
