txt William D. Mitchell , chief of counsel to the Congressional Pearl Harbor Committee , gave notice today that he and his staff were resigning soon , asserting that " extensive examination " of witnesses by " some members of the committee " had prevented the introduction of " much pertinent evidence . " Mr. Mitchell and his associates , however , agreed to remain on for a " short time in January . " He asserted that although he believed that the committee could complete its investigation by Jan. 3 , as required by Congress , " it has become increasingly apparent that some members of the committee have a different view than that entertained by counsel either as to the scope of the inquiry or as to what is pertinent evidence . " Because of this , he added , it seems certain that several more months of hearings would be required . Mr. Mitchell 's associates are Gerhard A. Gesell of Washington , Jule M. Hannaford of St. Paul , and John E. Masten of Canandaigua , N. Y.

He asserted ' that he was considering whether to retire from the committee and again take up his work a 's Senate majority leader . Five Democratic committeemen expressed regrets over Mr. Mitchell 's decision . The Republican members were silent . Mr. Mitchell , who was Solicitor General in the Coolidge Administration and Attorney General in the Hoover Cabinet , mentioned no names in the statement , which he read to the committee , but his criticisms mostly centered on what he called time-consuming questions over matters he considered irrelevant . He asserted that a month had been spent in hearing eight witnesses and that " at least sixty " remained to be examined . Mr. Mitchell said that he and his associates would be glad to help a new staff take over . He then asserted : " All of my staff accepted their places on my expectations and assurances that they would not be held up for any considerable time after Jan. 1 . My own obligations and responsibilities put me in the same position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time devoted to examination beyond that of the committee counsel . Their examination of Gen. George C. Marshall alone required nearly five days . New Counsel Is Called Problem Mr. Barkley told the committee that he had grave doubt that new counsel , who would be acceptable to it and willing to undertake work already so far in progress , could be found and said that he could not " now foresee " what the solution would be , adding : " I have no idea now , as to who might be willing to come in , and no idea as to how long this inquiry is going to take . " Saying that he had felt the Army and Navy Pearl Harbor reports , issued in August , raised " confusion " justifying a Congressional investigation , he recalled that it was his concurrent resolution which set up the committee . He added : " I felt it the duty of the majority party to accept the responsibility and whatever the consequences be . " Mr. Barkley said that he " honestly felt " that the inquiry could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now " obviously " impossible . " I must now decide whether I have any further duty to this committee and , if so , whether it outweighs my duty on the floor of the Senate , " Mr. Barkley asserted , adding : " During the next few days I will weigh these obligations , and if I should conclude that my duties in the Senate outweigh , for the next three , four or six months , my duties here , I shall resign from the committee . " The chairman said that no decision would be made before next week , - if then , as to the attorneys who would be approached to succeed Mr. Mitchell . Senator Brewster , Republican , of Maine , suggested Hugh Fulton , counsel for the Senate Defense Investigating Committee when President Truman was its chairman . Lucas Says Ferguson Repeats At the afternoon session Democratic members again accused the Republicans of repetitious crossexamination . While Senator Ferguson was questioning Lieut . Gen Leonard T. Gerow , who was Army War Plans Officer in 1941 , Senator Lucas , Democrat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that question at least half a dozen times . I can not for the life of me understand the necessity for repeating these questions over and over again . Mr. Chairman , would I and other members of this committee be permitted to ask the same question over and over again ? " Senator Ferguson protested that he was developing new matter , but Mr. Barkley said : " The chairman can not control the interrogation by members , even though they ask the same question over and over again . " " My only desire , " General Gerow asserted , " is to tell all I know about Pearl Harbor and I 'll be glad to answer any question I can . " General Gerow was the day 's only witness and was questioned all afternoon by Senator Ferguson , who indicated at adjournment that his examination was not completed . The general said that he was in his office on Dec. 7 , 1941 , from about 10 A. M. onward , but did not see until called to General Marshall 's office about 11:30 o'clock the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message directing Japan 's envoys to deliver it at 1 P. M. , Washington time . " Suppose you had known at 10 o'clock , that morning what you knew at 12 , would you have sent a warning message to General ( Walter C. ) Short in Hawaii ? " Senator Ferguson asked . " I would certainly have /drafted one , " General Gerow replied , add-ing : " If I could not have reached General Marshall at once I would have got the Secretary of War , told him what I was doing and got a message on the line as soon as possible . " When General Gerow was cut off by Senator Ferguson before he had completed a reply to another question , and Representative Murphy , Democrats of Pennsylvania , shouted : " He is a General who fought in France . He ought to be given some courtesy . He ought at least to be given an opportunity to answer the question . " Mr. Ferguson disclaimed any intention of interrupting the General . Turning to an investigation conducted by Lieut . Col. Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War , Senator Ferguson asked : 6 " Did Colonel Clausen ask you to make certain statements to contradict other witnesses ? " General Gerow , saying that Colonel Clausen visited him on the French Riviera where he was " taking my first leave in four years , " replied that he had been asked about matters which had come up in previous Pearl Harbor investigations . " Did he tell you he was trying to prove anything ? " asked the Senator . " No , sir , " replied the Geripral , " he stated he was trying to get my testimony as to certain actions in which I was involved . " It developed then that General Gerow made to Colonel Clausen an affidavit answering some . accusations contained in the Army Board 's report . The first of these was a statement that Col. Rufus Bratton , formerly assistant to Maj. Gen. Sherman Miles , Chief Army Intelligence Officer in 1941 , had called to General Gerow 's attention on Dec. 4 , 1911 , information that the Japanese were destroying their codes , asked General Gerow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted that " sufficient had been sent . " General Gerow 's reply to this in the affidavit was that he recalled no such conversation , and that if it had occurred and Colonel Bratton was dissatisfied , the Intelligence Division could have sent out the messages . Saying there was " no politics in the selection of counsel , " Mr. Barkley asserted : " I do not know now and never inquired whether any member of the legal ptaff is a Democrat or a Republican . " The Senator said that in thirtyodd years in public life , he had " not seen a more earnest or diligent or sincere effort " than Mr. Mitchell made for the committee . Mr. Barkley added that he was " immeasurably depressed , " and Senator George , Democrat , of Georgia , who has been silent at most of the hearing asserted : " I have remained on this committee because I felt we were fortunate in securing the aid of Mr. Mitchell .

" Ferguson Lays Delay to Counsel WASHINGTON , Dec. 14 ( a ) ? When Senator Ferguson was asked for comment on Mr. Mitchell 's action , he asserted that delays had been occasioned by the legal staff 's failure to supply committee members with pertinent documents well in advance of the appearance of witnesses who were to testify concerning them . " The committee still does not know all the information the counsel has , " he added . Asserting that Congress never had a " more serious job " than investigation of the Pearl Harbor attack , Mr. Ferguson said each member had a responsibility to see that all facts were developed . Representative Keefe , Republican , of Wisconsin , said that he saw no reason why the committee could not go ahead without a counsel if necessary . Getting information had been , " like pulling pin feathers from a turkey , " Mr. Keefe said . The committee 's present plans are to take a Christmas recess Dec. 21 or 22 .
