With labor and material costs rising and revenues dropping since V-J day , railroads have been struggling to keep their heads above water . Last week the Interstate Commerce Commission threw them a lifesaver : a 6% increase in freight rates , effective July 1-except for certain basic commodities such as products of agriculture , slag , gravel , etc. on which the boost was only 3% . To make up for their lower rate of earnings , Eastern railroads were allowed a further increase of 5% on all but anthracite and bituminous coal , lignite and iron ore . <P> The roads had asked for a 25% hike , told ICC that they stood to lose $345,000,000 this year if they did not get it ( TIME , April 29 ) . But ICC estimated that the roads needed only 6% more to net another $390,000,000 a year , more than enough to keep them in the black . And the new rates , said ICC , are only temporary . The roads will still be given a chance to present their case for higher permanent rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
