When a grinning , 19-year-old Norwegian named Torger Tokle landed in Manhattan two years ago , he was met by his older brother , Kyrre , who drove him to his farm in Noroton , Conn . Next day , Brother Kyrre was to compete in a ski-jumping meet at nearby Bear Mountain Park . " I yump too , " said Torger . Yump he did-and broke the hill record . <P> In his native Lokken Verk , where every other 12-year-old can jump 150 ft. , Torger <P> Tokle was just another ski rider . But in the U. S. he was a sensation . Here was a greenhorn who could jump 157 ft. on sea legs . He lacked the elegant style of Olympic Champion Birger Ruud and Norwegian Champion Reidar Andersen , two of his countrymen who had broken the trail ahead of him . But Torger Tokle had something . Experts say it is the oomph in his satz , that split-second transition from running to jumping at the takeoff . From knees like coiled springs he gets a tremendous lift-soaring out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nose . <P> To New England jumpers , Torger Tokle was a deep discouragement . Jumping is judged on form as well as distance , but Tokle 's tremendous , unpolished power won practically every meet he entered . In four successive Bear Mountain meets , he broke his own hill record , stretching it from 157 ft. to 163 ft . In his first year in the U. S. , towheaded Torger Tokle won 15 out of 16 tournaments , broke nine hill records . <P> By last week , Torger Tokle had become America 's favorite snow bird . Ten days ago , in a meet at Leavenworth , Wash. , he soared 273 ft. , longest jump ever recorded in North American competition . Then he flew back to New York to compete three days later in the Franklin D. Roosevelt Cup meet at Bear Mountain , his first and favorite hill . Most Norwegians frown on skyscraping ski jumps built for headlines rather than for sport-like that at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in the Bavarian Alps , where jumpers have leaped 300 ft . The Bear Mountain ski jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer than 160 ft . <P> Still , the 12,000 New Yorkers who turned out to greet Torger Tokle last week had a hunch that he would make quite a yump . Lined up around the course like a gigantic keyhole , they watched his familiar blue-clad figure flick down the " inrun " at 50 m.p.h. , float past the judges ' tower , and glide , arms whirling , into their midst in a perfect landing . His first jump measured 167 ft . In the gathering dusk he took off for his second . This lime he landed on one ski , nearly fell . When the span was measured , a mighty roar went up . Tokle had soared 180 ft. , broken a record for the 13th time .
