An increasing number of fugitives were bursting out from behind the Iron Curtain with their clothes on fire . They were of two general kinds-Germans fleeing from the crushing caresses of their new Soviet masters ; Soviet citizens fleeing from Russia . During August , 100,000 Soviet Zone Germans tried-about half of them successfully-to cross into the U.S. zone . Among them were some bigwigs : <P> Dr. Rudolf Paul , Minister President of Thuringia ; Theodor Plivier , longtime Communist writer , whose book called Stalingrad won him Soviet kudos ; Jena 's Mayor Heinrich Mertens ; Mhlhausen 's Mayor Heinrich Stuecker ; Mine Director Hans Grassman , who had bossed four Soviet workings in Saxony , where 10,000 conscripted Germans were mining for uranium . <P> Home in a Strait Jacket . Desertions from all ranks of the Red Army were so numerous that Russian border guards had been doubled . Berlin saw a typical tragedy . When young Red Army Senior Lieut . Alexis Kovalev was ordered back to Russia , he slashed his wrists . But he was rushed to one of Berlin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the U.S. zone . Because of a U.S.Russian agreement to return each other 's soldiery , his pleas were vain . When Red Army MPs came for him , Kovalev fought until they clapped a strait jacket on him . Hospital attendants last saw him in a Red Army ambulance beating his head against the side panels , trying to kill himself . <P> <P> Another Russian runaway was Georgian-born Lieut . General Gulishvili . Chief intelligence officer in the Soviet zone of Austria , Gulishvili skipped from Vienna in August and stopped off in Paris . Last week , when he was safely en route to South America , France-Soir published his answers to some pertinent questions . Most pertinent : <P> The Red Army is being reorganized . It will not be ready for war until 1952 . It will not have atomic weapons before then . It will not have long-range aircraft before 1950 . <P> One Pistol-One Ammunition . The strangest fugitives were the Ukrainians . For international purposes , such as gatherings of the U.N. , the Soviet Union treats the Ukrainian republic ts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw off the Soviet yoke since 1918 . A group of Ukrainian partisans under a 25-year-old leader named Lakhidnya had fought their way to the U.S. zone last summer . Since then , they have been filtering through in small detachments . They can not be classed as D.P.s . So the somewhat baffled U.S. military authorities have interned them in a barracks in Bavaria . <P> One day Lakhidnya asked a U.S. lieutenant : " When you will start fighting the Russians ? " The lieutenant had heard the question many times before . Jokingly he pointed to a row of carbines : " When we have two more guns . " To Lakhidnya it was a poor joke . But he smiled politely and said : " One pistol-that all you need . that - and one ammunition . "
