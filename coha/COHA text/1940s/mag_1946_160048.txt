At Lake Success last week a Russian scientist created a minor sensation in a very major matter when it appeared that he was moving his country approximately half an inch toward international control of the atom . The sensation promptly collapsed . <P> Since last June the U.N . ' s Atomic Energy Commission had floundered in a deadlock between the U.S. desire for international inspection and the Soviet objection that such inspection would violate national sovereignty . The UNAEC has sidetracked political debate for technical fact-finding ; the Scientific &; Technical Committee at length surfaced with a report , unanimously agreed to by twelve nations , that control is technologically feasible . Whether control is politically acceptable the committee did not discuss . <P> Thirsty for atomic news , good or bad , the Manhattan dailies last week pounced on some remarks made by Soviet scientific adviser Semen P. Alexandrov. who is a bigwig at Moscow 's Central Institute of Research in Non-Ferrous Metals , and was one of Russia 's two official witnesses at Bikini . It might be useful , Professor Alexandrov had suggested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of each nation 's raw material and the efficiency of mining methods . It might also be useful to compare notes on how uranium and thorium deposits were classified . Russia , he said , had set up three categories : visible , probable and possible resources . <P> <P> In the body of their stories , the papers reported Professor Alexandrov 's remarks more or less accurately , but in their headlines and leads they gave the impression that he was talking about international " control " and " supervision . " Since the Russian had no such things in mind , he denounced the stories as " sensation " reporting . Delegate Andrei Gromyko further squelched the matter by claiming that Alexandrov had merely drawn attention to the lack of information on raw materials - that and nothing more . As for controls , Gromyko added , " the Soviet delegation considers the national control to be sufficient . . . . " <P> Meanwhile , however , the U.S. delegates had perked up when they heard Alexandrov talking about " balance sheets . " Would the balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , checked by some outside agency ? Remembering that he is more of a scientist than a diplomat , Professor Alexandrov pulled in his neck . He was not prepared to answer right away , he said , but would bring the matter up again at some later time . <P> The deadlock continued-and so did the atomic arms race which the UNAEC was set up to prevent .
