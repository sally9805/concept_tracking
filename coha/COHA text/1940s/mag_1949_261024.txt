Ralph Budd , the " president of railroad presidents , " obeyed one of his own rules and announced last week that a new man would be running the Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy Railroad on Sept. i . A Budd-made regulation requires executives of the fourth longest U.S. railroad system to retire when they reach 70 . <P> A protg of Railroader James J. Hill , Budd ran the Burlington with the dash and vision of the old Great Northern empire builder . Taking over the depression-troubled " Q " in 1932 , he put it on its feet by such business catchers as the first dieselized streamliner . And he made the " Q " famous as a training school for railroaders-including the Rock Island 's John Farrington , Santa Fe 's Fred Gurley , the Great Northern 's Frank Gavin . <P> Budd also trained Harry C. Murphy , 57 , to take over the " Q " presidency . The road should feel no jolt when the hand on the throttle changes next month ; Murphy has served under Budd for 17 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1945 . <P> A mild-mannered plugger , Murphy has no hobbies except work , has built his entire reputation within the Burlington system . Before joining the Burlington in 1914 , he strung telephone lines , later worked as a laborer , station helper and agent for the old Iowa Central Railroad . After a noncombat stint as an airplane pilot in World War I , he came back to the " Q " as a division engineer and toiled faithfully at assorted jobs , touching every rung on the ladder as he climbed . If hard work could keep the " Q " highballing , Harry Murphy was the man for the job . <P> Retiring Ralph Budd was much too full of beans to settle down yet . When he leaves the " Q , " he will move into the chairmanship of the Chicago Transit Board at $35,000 a year .
