Few Britons ventured on " Happy New Year " greetings last week . Their New Year mood , conditioned by Rundstedt 's drive and the prolongation of the five-year-old war , was caught by the relentless national jester Nat Gubbins ( London Sunday Express ) : " By looking through the bottom of an upturned glass in a dimout one can foresee that the war , of course , will continue almost indefinitely , and as the people get more &; more fed up with it the Government will lose its temper and impose stricter measures for keeping noses to the grindstone . <P> " . . . Helped by German propaganda , the military experts will tell you that the German Army is composed almost entirely of ten-year-old boys , men over 70 , invalids and cripples . . . . Spring will arrive at the usual time , March 21st , but you wo n't notice it unless you watch the calendar carefully . There will be no change in the weather except for the worse . . . . <P> " Easter will come &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the summer dealing with new V-weapons and not going on holidays . <P> " About August the same fools who said it last August will be saying that the war will be over by Christmas . But they will be wrong as usual . The German Army , now composed entirely of eight-year-old boys , men over 80 and old women in Bath chairs , will break through at the place they always use for breaking through . This will cause wide-eyed astonishment at Allied headquarters . . . while that old Swedish haberdasher who is always flying between Berlin and Stockholm will be telling correspondents that the German civil population has almost reached the breaking point .
