The hour had come when the truth was more useful than propaganda . With his back to the Alps , Benito Mussolini last week ladled out the truth . He did it sparingly , and he mixed it with apologies and name-calling. * But one of the greatest strutters on the world 's stage at last came down to earth . <P> " This is not a speech , " Mussolini told the National Council of Corporations in a voice that wheezed but did not falter . " I am going to review the first 30 months of war with statistics . . . . We are the only country which gives exact figures of losses in communiques . " <P> If this were a matter of pride to Mussolini , then the statistics he gave of war losses for a nation of 44,000,000 were not : Army deaths , 40,588 ; Navy deaths , 33,500 ; Air Force deaths , 20,124 ; Italians taken prisoner , 232,778 ; Army wounded , 80,772 ; missing in action , 37,000 . <P> Other bits of truth : <P> &gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . ... " <P> &gt; " People say Italians are not now so enthusiastic for war . " <P> &gt; " We do not like to forecast the future ; today the question is : ' To be or not to be ' in this most formidable struggle in human history . " <P> Less candid was Mussolini when he quoted , and then answered , Winston Churchill 's threat ( TIME , Dec. 7 ) of " prolonged , scientific and systematic " bombing of southern Italy . Said Mussolini : " We have . . . shelters that can resist the biggest bombs . " Other omissions : <P> &gt;Blockbuster bombs on northern industrial cities have been followed by looting and civilian terror , a run on banks , wild Brambles for safety in the countryside . R.A.F. reconnaissance planes photographed the bomb damage . One-third of the war plants in Italy 's concentrated industrial area have been damaged . <P> &gt; " Germany , " said Mussolini , " will give powerful assistance in the form of antiaircraft artillery to insure Italian defenses . " He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resist invasion-or to shoot Italians who do not fight . The arrival of Reich Marshal Hermann Goring and of Gestapo Chief Heinrich Himmler last week was expected to mean complete German control of military and civilian defenses . Germans realize that successful completion of the Allied invasion of North Africa ( see p. 34 ) , if followed by an invasion of Italy , would allow bombers to blast German war plants now out of reach of Britain-based planes . The arc of the Alps could be bypassed by land troops without danger of an Italian flank attack along the historic Balkan route to Germany 's back door . Along part of that route Yugoslav partisans last week had a new fighting front . <P> &gt;Spindrift was Mussolini 's claim that " there has never been any act of sabotage or protest against the war . " He conveniently forgot his purge of 160,000 faltering Fascist Party members and the close watch the Gestapo and the Ovra are keeping on suspected revolutionaries and possible Darlanites . He made no mention of reports that near Foggia 40,000 peasants had joined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after four days by troops from Rome ; or that at Genoa on Oct. 23 air-raid wardens staged an anti-war demonstration .
