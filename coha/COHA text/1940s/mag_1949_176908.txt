Last summer , fed up with years of haggling over conductors , wages , and spokesmen , Seattle 's symphony musicians rebelled . After forming their own orchestra ( TIME , Aug. 23 ) , they picked their own conductor , a bright , energetic young localite named Eugene Linden . While the old Seattle Symphony 's socialite directors screamed " musical mobsters , " the new orchestra made music merrily-and successfully-though most of Seattle 's mink and 75-cigar set boycotted the concerts . One reason for the success ( and the boycott ) was a tall , bosomy woman named Cecilia Schultz , whom the musicians had picked to carry their flag and manage their money . <P> Bustling about in her monkey-fur jacket and top-heavy hats , her pince-nez perched precariously on her thin nose , Impresario " Cissy " Schultz has long been as much a part of Seattle 's musical scene as the musicians . For the past 25 years , she has run nearly everything musical in town except the symphony . Last summer when even that finally fell her way , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her clutches on the orchestra . " Cissy rasped , in a voice sometimes compared to the sound of tearing canvas : " These big-business tycoons are just little boys when it comes to music . " <P> Lock Up the Safe . Actually , the musicians , not Cissy , had done the clutching . To help them out in their first year , she gave them , for a small percentage ( " I still have to keep Cissy in ham &; eggs " ) , use of both her Moore Theater and her talents as an impresario , which even her enemies admit are considerable . <P> A woman who wears her 50s with an air of long-faced gravity , Cissy learned her business the hard way : by getting trimmed the first time out . She paid $500 for a would-be Hildegarde of the pre-jazz era , only to discover , after the act had flopped , that the entertainer 's usual price was $50 . Now when Cissy sallies into Manhattan each year to forage for her annual purchases ( up to $250,000 worth ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) , New York managers jovially call to their secretaries to lock up the safe . Recently , when a drunk fell through a window almost onto her desk , she surveyed him calmly , then told him : " You 're the only person to get into my theater free in 20 years . " Says Cissy : " I 'm no Lily Pons , but I bet I have just as good a time . " <P> " Pretty Good About This . " Last week , Cissy Schultz was having the time of her life . The old-guard Seattle Symphony Orchestra board had finally agreed to sponsor the orchestra for the rest of the season and happily ever after . Among their concessions : two musicians ( for the rest of this season at least , a clarinet and a French horn ) could sit on the board . <P> Said Board President Joseph E. Gandy : " A happy solution . " Said Cissy , who may continue as manager : " All those board members have been pretty good about this . I guess a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to give the musicians a good break , and that 's what 's important . "
