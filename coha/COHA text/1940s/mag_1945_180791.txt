There was chanting of the Carmagnole . There were shouts of " To the lamppost . " France 's first Bastille Day since liberation brought Parisians into the streets for snake-dancing on the boulevards , parades , surreptitious fireworks ( firecrackers are officially banned ) . But the Bastille Day gaiety was less spontaneous than official . Said one French spectator : " It 's all very well to show the people a military spectacle , but they are still worried about food . " <P> On hand for the occasion were Prague 's Mayor Vaclav Macek and a " Monsieur Mong " representing the mayor of Chungking . But France 's most important guest was Sidi Lamine , Bey of Tunis . He arrived wearing fez , black tunic and red gold-striped trousers . Across his chest shimmered the red sash of the Legion of Honor . <P> At the Bois de Boulogne station the Bey was met by General Charles de Gaulle and whisked through flag-decked streets toward the Hotel Talleyrand , to freshen up for the ceremonies , which included the presentation by the Bey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamine was not the only distinguished African visitor to Paris in recent weeks . He had been preceded by Sidi Mohamed Ben Youseff , Sultan of Morocco , who had received the Croix de la Liberation ( his son Prince Moulay Hassan was also decorated-see cut ) and was shown a hydroelectric dam in the Auvergne Mountains . Behind these comings &; goings was potential trouble in France 's North African empire and the specter of France 's Syrian debacle ( epitomized in the Damascus parliament building wrecked-see cut - by French mortars in an attack which Syrians refer to as " Syria 's Pearl Harbor " ) . North Africa was restive . Like Frenchmen , Moroccans , Algerians and Tunisians were still worried about the food shortage . Last year , arid Morocco had its worst drought since 1904 . This year 's crop will be sufficient only for seed . And Algeria , where bloody revolts were bloodily suppressed ( TIME , May 28 ) , was still hungry too .                   @ @
