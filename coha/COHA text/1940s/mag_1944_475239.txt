DANIEL J. CALLAGHAN was born and brought up in the San Francisco of pre-earthquake days , a gracious , cosmopolitan , and rather bawdy city , somewhat continental in character . Such cities in Europe usually contain a stratum of families almost pietistic in their devoutness and their strict adherence not only to the observances but also to the moral code of the Church . These families are usually socially somewhat separated from the rest of the community ; they gather round some particular church or similar institution and the home is of great importance to them . It was so in the San Francisco of the nineties ; and the Callaghan family were members of a group that pivoted around St. Ignatius ' School , where young Dan got his early education . The difference was that in America and particularly in San Francisco an element of energy was added , quite foreign to the European experience , so that instead of living the cloistered existence of such a family in , say , Vienna or Dijon , the younger Callaghans got as actively into everything as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bay and frequently aboard the ship on which his uncle , the to-be admiral James J. Raby , was then serving . There were three other brothers ; they must have brought home some rare tales from time to time . But the point is that they were early made to realize that the lush life around them belonged to another world . In their own lives , strict discipline was accompanied by a joyousness of outlook in which that exterior world had little part . The lesson was thoroughly learned ; when young Dan Callaghan arrived at Annapolis in the summer of 1907 , aetat seventeen , to salute for the first time the bronze statue of Tecumseh which is known as " the God of 2.5 , " he had already seen more of life and was more mature than most men in the upper classes . Physically also he attained maturity early . A portrait of him at the time ( it is quite definitely a bad picture and may not be wholly representative ) shows him as a young man with a lot of chin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost set expression around the small mouth . He was uncommonly large , both vertically and horizontally , for his age ; a eupeptic man , whose abounding energy earned him the nickname of " Fire Engine , " though he was occasionally called " Fat " and did n't like it because it was an injustice . He might have been a tower of strength to the football team but early in the game hurt a leg so that baseball became his sport . In his fourth year at the Academy jection would be held punishable disobedience by a court martial . But an officer of executive rank can , and not infrequently does , make things extremely unpleasant for a junior who thus establishes himself as a disobliging fellow . Nothing of the kind happened with Dan Callaghan ; all the refusal brought him was additional respect , and the Armored Cruiser Squadron sailed back to San Francisco , where home again was celebrated by the steerage with a masked visit to one of the hottest spots on the Barbary Coast . Callaghan stayed aboard as junior duty officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the law automatically commissioning graduates of the Academy as ensigns , which advanced those who held the passed midshipman rank to ensign without examination . It is characteristic not so much of the future admiral himself as of what others thought of him that this was considered a break for him , since the examination at this grade was the toughest on the list and it was doubted whether he would make it . He was by now a well-qualified junior watch officer and the record of his turret had been brilliant , but this was felt to be because he got along so well with the men that they worked their heads off for him , whereas the examiners would want to know how he stood on differential calculus . The Navy had not yet taken its scientific training as a matter of course and started looking for leadership . It had , however , been doing something about the physical condition of its officers ever since the days of the first Roosevelt . There was still on the books a fiat from that advocate of the strenuous life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least once a month . The ship acquired a new skipper about this time -- that McNulty who later adopted some Russian refugees and married one of them ? and as one of the means of tightening up on the tough boys in the steerage he enforced the exercise rule . Officers were observed trotting unhappily around the quarterdeck mile after mile , with pedometers strapped to their legs . MAGAZINE At this juncture the ship was sent down to lie off the depressing palm-fringed coasts of western Nicaragua as part of the Wilson occupation . Ensign Dan Callaghan formed part of the landing party that went ashore with the Marines under their major ( another not unknown to future fame ? Smedley D. Butler ) , and with them participated in the shoot-andrun affair dignified by the name of the Battle of Coyotepe Hill . It was unimportant to everyone but the Nicaraguan who got knocked off and to Dan Callaghan . To the latter it meant an opportunity to cover his thirty miles without that depressing round of the decks . He began doing his turn on the beach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was still a melancholy business plowing through the soft sand , so he organized a couple of baseball teams , sometimes playing with the pedometer on his leg to get his thirty miles into the official records . Today they would call him athletic officer and an important cog in the ship 's morale machinery , but in 1913 it was all new . The men loved it and Callaghan found out something fairly important about gaining their co-operation . MIIEN Mexico blew up . Madero upset the old tyranny of Porfirio Diaz ; Huerta turned traitor on Madero and shot him ; and the armored cruiser California went up to Guaymas on the Gulf of California to watch the West Coast . There was much anti-Americanism among the Mexicans there . One Saturday afternoon a liberty party from the ship got soused in Guaymas . The shore patrolmen tried to arrest them ; the chief of police in the town , a Huertista , cut himself in on the row and shot two of the patrolmen dead . The excitement caused by this news was intense ; everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the age , that the police chief 's forty-five had fired the first shots of a war . Nevertheless Callaghan walked up to the Captain and with the proper salute asked permission to go ashore for mass in the morning . No one else who was present at the interview now survives ; all we know is that the permission was given and that Ensign Callaghan went to church next morning in an intensely hostile city , alone and unarmed . He continued to go to the same church every Sunday till the ship was ordered back to San Francisco and he was detached . IT is the Navy custom to shift its young officers to a different ship and type of duty after two years , the idea being to produce a man who has no special technical prejudices by the time he reaches the upper ranks of command . Ensign Dan Callaghan , already beginning to specialize in ordnance , was thus assigned to the destroyer Truxtun as engineer officer . But it is also the custom to alternate tours of sea duty with jobs on one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain amount of mystery in why this was not done in Callaghan 's case . The probable explanation is that in those days nearly all the fleet was in the Atlantic and the available shore jobs were on the East Coast . Callaghan had a very particular reason for wishing to keep San Francisco as his home post ? to wit , that a considerable proportion of the letters he so indefatigably wrote were directed to a certain Mary Tormey , a singularly beautiful girl belonging to the same social group from which he had sprung . When the California put into her home port this long-range courtship had culminated in marriage . The Truxtun would give him more sea duty ; but the destroyers of that day were more often in harbor than abroad on the bounding main , for which their construction did not suit them . So Mrs. Mary Callaghan continued to live with her widowed mother while Ensign Dan 's married life consisted of a series of visits from the destroyer base at San Pedro . There is a description of him from this period as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare . With his ship secured at the Mare Island Navy Yard for overhaul , it seemed that he could have gone home a great deal more than he did , yet he maintained an inflexible commuter 's schedule which got him up very early in the morning and home very late at night . " IV Pinifs seriousness no doubt dates at least partly from his experience in the roaring steerage of the California ( he was to change later when he discovered that all officers in the Navy were not like that ) ; but partly also it was due to the Truxtun herself . She was one of a class since made famous in fiction as Delilah , 420-tanners optimistically described as seagoing by their builders , coal burners with a whaleback bow forward that was supposed to make them seaworthy but only succeeded in making them cramped . There were sixty-one men and three officers , who lived a rugged life in rooms the size of a Chic Sale special placed dead aft over the screws " so that it was like sleeping in a coffee grinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea he never got any sleep anyway . The organization meant that all three officers had to stand bridge watches , and when he came off one of these it was back to the engine room to toil with machinery that had been built in 1901 , had seen hard service , and was now thoroughly obsolete . As it turned out there was more sea duty than he had anticipated ; no sooner had the destroyer been fitted out than she was ordered down to the Mexican coast , where the pot was still boiling . There were no interior passageways through the ship . One had to get from one compartment to another by scrambling perilously across the deck and down a hatch , so that the food was always cold by the time it had been carried from the galley under the bridge to the wardroom aft . This did not matter much either , for the little destroyer rolled and pitched so furiously that it was impossible to keep a cooking vessel of any kind on the stove at sea and all the officers took their meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or onion sandwiches with coffee on the side . There was no radio and the only light was provided by a five-kilowatt generator ; and in cold weather the water that was perpetually coming down the hatches formed a film of ice across the deck of Callaghan 's cabin from which his shoes stood up like islands . " The bunkers in those ships , " says one who served in them , , were in the narrow space between the skin of the ship and the boiler-room bulkheads and were divided themselves into small compartments by several athwartship bulkheads . The coal we usually got was very fine , almost powdered , and frequently wet . . . . This meant that a man had to go into each individual bunker through a deck hatch , carrying a candle and armed with a slice-bar to strike the coal down . Between the smallness of the compartment , the powdered coal dust filling the air , the motion of the vessel , and the heat of the atmosphere it came near killing anyone who was not very tough . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , especially when the going was particularly rough ? not as a devotee of the ancient chestnut about ordering his men to do nothing he would himself avoid , but because he considered himself the man best able to handle a difficult job and he wanted it over with . The men adored him , though he was the very antithesis of the usual destroyer officer , who was a rather dashing and raffish fellow always in some scrape . Close relations between officers and crew were not unusual in those old destroyers , which had neither chaplain nor doctor . The men would bring up problems ? " Well , you see , sir , I 'm having a little trouble with my wife , " or " Sir , there 's a big ranch right next to that farm I own at Sausalito and . . . " With Callaghan this was intensified ; in spite of his youth he acquired the name of " Uncle Dan " and in return for their respect he gave the men a degree of confidence unusual even for that service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary . MHAT was what caught up with him . 1 The Truxtun , with three of her sisters , had returned to the States early in 1915 to prepare for a cruise to Alaska . As she was tuning up for the trip the starboard condenser began to behave badly . Callaghan opened it up , found some of the condenser ferrules were corroded , and replaced them . The occurrence was not unusual and a spare supply of these small brass devices was carried aboard , but as they seemed to be going a little faster than normal , Callaghan drew on the nearest destroyer tender for forty-eight more , all she could give him . When he got to the yard , which was in May , he requisitioned another seven hundred in anticipation of the long cruise . He was frantically overworked at the time and a good deal worried . His wife had a baby coming and was having none too easy a time of it ; his younger brother had just graduated from St. Ignatius , was getting ready for his entrance examinations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive of the ship as well as her engineer officer . In June the condenser balked again ; forty or fifty more ferrules were replaced . In the early weeks of July , with everything ready for the big cruise and the ship running up the Coast , it went irreparably wrong ; the Truxtun had to signal inability to make the trip and go into dockyard to have the whole condenser replaced . In the Navy some person is always responsible . The board of investigation ( which is a kind of maritime grand jury ) found that the Truxtun condenser ferrules had shown a high rate of corrosion ; that she was a freak ship , built by a Baltimore yard , slightly different from the rest of her class in the pitch and threading of her condenser ferrules ; that the seven hundred ferrules taken in at the dockyard would not fit . In the judgment of someone topside , the failure to requisition ferrules sooner and to inspect meticulously for accuracy those that he did get constituted dereliction of duty on the part of Lieutenant ( j.g @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duties and ordered before a general court martial , which had power to dismiss him from the service for such an offense . There was a nine days ' wonder in fleet wardrooms over the irony of the most conscientious man in the service being brought up on such a charge , but the wheels of the law ground inexorably toward the court martial in August . Then it came out that the condenser plate had developed a case of galloping consumption for some electrolytic reason that not even the scientist could explain ; no amount of ferrule replacement would have done any good . As for the seven hundred that did not fit , they had been received aboard by one of Uncle Dan 's fireroorn staff , a semi-illiterate ( not uncommon in the Navy in those days ) ignorant of the uses of a pitch gauge , who had pronounced them satisfactory in order to save his beloved chief the trouble . Callaghan received a verdict of full acquittal , the highest form of exoneration he could get from the court . He had discovered with Thiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compose de /aches , de menteurs , et de paresseux . " The character was now complete ; all the rest is in how it worked out . But when the twenty-five-year-old lieutenant went home after the court martial it was noted by those who had not seen him for several months that his hair had become prematurely gray . V Pl-RHE clock turns to November , 1916 , with Woodrow Wilson just elected for keeping us out of war and most people in the services doubting whether he would be able to keep it up . Lieutenant Dan Callaghan , having finished his tour of duty in destroyers by working up to the command of the Truxtun , was ordered up to Bremerton as engineer officer for the recommissioning of the old protected cruiser New Orleans . She was one of the famous Iine of Elswick cruisers , and there were none better in the world ? when they were built . This one had been built exactly twenty years before for the Brazilian government , had been bought by our Navy for use in the Spanish War , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchor chain because nobody loved her . The reason for this was that both British construction and Brazilian ownership had left their marks . To the former she owed her small size , about that of a modern heavy destroyer ; a wardroom which would not hold more than four officers at a time , where the spirit locker was the largest piece of furniture ; and officers ' quarters in the traditional British position , dead aft over the screws where vibration could not possibly be missed . To the Brazilian ownership she was indebted for small bunkers and for valves , gauges , and working parts marked in Portuguese . The service of U.S.S. New Orleans was one of hilarious low comedy . Her petty officers were old Navy ; her crew were mainly young reservists from Oregon and Washington , the very best of material . Their ship was a wandering curiosity shop and they were determined to have a good time . Those who saw Dan Callaghan during this service remember him as the life of the party , always joking , laughing , or eagerly discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played himself ; when he could not , he trotted around the engine room , caroling a merry stave as he lifted a 175-pound valve into place ; for as on the Truxtun , he often did things like that himself as the quickest way of getting them done . His life had smoothed out , with a fine son and mother both doing well . The younger brother was coming through at Annapolis ; he himself was in line for promotion and the exec 's billet on the ship . He had a number of friendships made in the wardroom , including one with a young Navy doctor which was to last the rest of his life and play an important part in his career ? Ross McIntire . Not that they had an easy time aboard the New Orleans . When she reached the Atlantic the United States was at war and she went at once into the most nerve-racking service in the world ? convoy , mostly from Staten Island ports toward the Mediterranean . Because of her age and lack of speed she always drew the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knicknacks , six- and eight-knot ships that sometimes showed a minus figure for the day 's run against the wind . Near the coast of Europe the convoys would be met by British destroyers and the New Orleans would turn back , which meant that she had to make double the Atlantic voyage every trip . This was more than her fuel capacity would permit . They built pens of light boards around her main hatch and piled them high with coal in bags , then shoveled 5 loose coal in among the bags . Of course this covered the whole ship with coal dust when the wind blew , and when it blew really hard the loose coal would start flying , then the bags and the pens that held them , so that approximately every third trip she had to put in at the Azores to coal ship for the return voyage . Nobody seemed to mind ; in fact the only thing they did mind was that they never got a shot at a German sub or surface raider , out of all that weary voyaging . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liner off the north of Scotland in a gale . It fell to Callaghan to make arrangements for taking her in tow ; she was five times the size of the little cruiser , and his captain reported afterward that he did not think any other engineer in the Navy could have made it , but Uncle Dan did . That gave him his step and executive rank ; and late in 1918 his tour of duty on the New Orleans ran out . VI 7 F he were to progress much farther in the Navy it was essential that he take a whirl at shore duty . He was probably not very delighted with the idea , but he conscientiously took up the assignment , which was at the Bureau of Navigation in Washington ; and Mary Callaghan came East to join him . Nobody who knew him will say very much about the two years he spent in that office , and their silence probably covers the fact that he was unhappy . He had now been at sea for seven years , the most formative of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out of the way , everything had been free and easy with Uncle Dan . Now he was suddenly in a world of boundless protocol and red tape and questions of personality ; and perhaps , too , it was a little difficult getting used to having women around all the time instead of for a week-end once in three months . He played the game without flinching . People who visited his house of an evening , both in the Washington days and later , are unanimous in saying what a fine time they had with this good companion who mixed cocktails for all the guests , taking none himself , passe d out cigars and cigarettes which he himsel did not smoke , and served excellent din ners when he would have gladly done w th a Bermuda onion sandwich . He played the game at the office too , listening to endless requests for this duty or that , balancing , persuading . For the Bureau of Navigation had nothing to do with navigation . it was the personnel office of the Navy ( which has since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignments to duty were made and refused . To it came officers presenting kicks about being assigned to the staff of the Governor of Guam , ten million miles from nowhere ; or requesting duty aboard the Birmingham , because old friend Joe Gish was her exec ? with all the surreptitious pressures that go with such a situation . In normal times this would be bad enough for a friendly man like Callaghan , who hated refusing to do things for other people . But 1919 and 1920 were the particularly bad years , with demobilization , ships laid up , staffs pared down , and the department inventing all sorts of rules to persuade officers to leave a service that had room for only half of them , no matter how good their war . records . Callaghan stuck to it for the full two years , giving no sign that he was doing anything but enjoying himself ; but there is every reason to believe he was glad when it was over and he could go to sea again as assistant fire control officer of the new battleship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is capital , marking a prime transition period , both in the history of Daniel Callaghan and of the Navy . The Washington treaties were just over the hill , the fleet was shifting to the Pacific to take on a character wholly new . Callaghan was now settled in his profession and in his specialization , his dislike of the East and his liking for service afloat . In the course of the next decade and a half he followed the line of duty normal to an officer of his background ? short tours ashore on the Board of inspection and Survey and with the Naval R.O.T.C. ; longer tours afloat on the battleships Colorado , Mississippi , Pennsylvania , and finally Cal2fornia , on the last of which he worked up to gunnery officer on the staff of the commander , U. S. Fleet , who was Admiral Leigh . Callaghan now moved constantly from ship to ship , arranging gunnery problems and supervising drills . He was convinced that skill with guns , especially the big guns of battleships , would be the ultimately determining factor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream of naval thought that threw into prominence now the torpedo , now the airplane . About the smaller pieces he was less sure , particularly those in the anti-aircraft category . It was only human for captains to put the best men in the big gun turrets , where they could run up scores that looked well on the ship 's record and on their own . Perhaps some different system of scoring competitions ? or perhaps a different type of anti-aircraft gun . . Dan Callaghan had , in fact , become one of those people who form the fundamental policies of the Navy . Under its own peculiar system this policy-making is not done directly and by orders , but through the exchange of ideas in wardroom conversations , leading up to a tactful suggestion offered to that lonely man , the admiral , who has learned that even a junior lieutenant may produce the key item that causes a whole program to succeed . There is too much executive detail for the admiral to consider , there are too many questions with an instant yes or no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is the function of his juniors , especially the staff officers . The system is peculiar to navies and , in its fullest development , to the American Navy . It is one of the reasons why that service operates more as a unit than most military organizations . " We do all our fighting behind closed doors and then get behind the line that wins out , " one of its officers has said . The wardroom conversations are also the reason why it is rarely possible to assign any development to an individual , or to say what an individual has done . He is an influence which can hardly be described by anything more than a signpost indicating directions . Dan Callaghan 's influence was in the direction of more guns . We have a picture of him exerting that influence in the wardroom of his second ship California , chewing continuously on hard candies and drinking coffee as he talked ( and he used to upset his stomach and to straighten out he chewed peppermint drops , which of course made matters worse , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a day spent in exercises at sea , the young officers had hurried ashore to cocktails and dinner , he would go down to the wardroom with his box of candy , send for a cup of coffee , and talk . If the conversation turned away from gunnery or sport ( he had added football to his range of interest since his son had turned out to be a crack player for St. Ignatius ) he was a little apt to lose interest after a while and go off to his cabin to work . In the morning he would be up early , serious about his business --  " stolid in his temperament , not a bit of Irish flash about him , " one friend puts it . At sea he would have a handball board rigged on the quarterdeck with a cage over it and play by the hour , usually with the young athletes fresh from the Academy , since no one anywhere near his own age could stand against him . VII -U NDER normal peacetime conditions less than one Naval Academy graduate in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiral 's flag . An indispensable preliminary of this is that the candidate shall have commanded a large ship with satisfaction , since ideas and the ability to lead a large organization do not always go together , as Mahan demonstrated in his personal career . An almost indispensable prelimi- ? nary of captaincy is that the man shall have been executive officer of some big ship . Commander Callaghan was already marked as a possible future admiral but his service in the higher ranks had been almost exclusively staff ; so in 1936 the Bureau of Navigation gave him a chance to fill out his experience by naming him exec of the heavy cruiser Portland . He did a rather remarkable job . Under the peace establishment the efficiency of a deleted material bombers showed what they could do to ships in the fighting off Norway . Especially he seems to have been interested in the introduction of the 40-millimeter Bofors , which was to prove the number-one weapon against close-in planes . At the time the 40-millimeter Bofors lacked a good fire-control mechanism ; the sights on the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature ; so were the percussion fuses on the ammunition . It took a good deal of penetration on the part of both Callaghan and the President to perceive that the weapon had possibilities for development . The details are not precisely important ; the important fact is that Captain Callaghan had become one of what the believers of victory through airpower somewhat derisively called " battleship admirals . " He thought that the arbitrament of battle at sea still lay with the gun and the ships that could carry it ; and that such a ship was less than she should be unless she could furnish her own air cover . VIII Trg the spring of 1941 the heavy cruiser A San Francisco needed a new skipper and Callaghan was in line for the appointment that would mean his admiral 's stars . The President released him from his aide 's appointment several weeks early to seize the opportunity . With this ship , the first he had commanded since the old Truxtun , Captain Callaghan plunged into the void that surrounds the wartime movements of a vessel not actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harbor at the time of the attack ; she is not mentioned in Admiral King 's report as among the vessels present during the Gilbert-Marshall raid , the bombing of Tokyo , or the Battle of the Coral Sea ; and by the latter date , indeed , orders were already under way detaching Uncle Dan from his ship for more staff duty with the rank of Rear Admiral . It came about this way : Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley had been recalled from his post as naval attach ? in London to head the recently-formed Southwest Pacific Command . He asked the Bureau of Personnel to recommend a chief of staff ; he had no preference . They knew Ghormley there at the bureau ? a man who did a lot of thinking on broad strategic lines , very accurate in his estimates of situations and means , somewhat remote from those around him . To form one of those duets of intellect and character which have always achieved the most spectacular results in war ( Hindenburg and Ludendorff , Grant and Sherman ) he would need a chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and offensive spirit . " How would Dan Callaghan do ? " " Delighted ; just the man I would have chosen if I had the pick of the entire Navy , " said Ghormley and went down to Noum6a , where Callaghan joined him in June , just after Midway had been fought and it had become clear that we possessed the means for an offensive ? provided we kept it small , both as to commitments and as to area . That was the genesis of the Guadalcanal campaign , which was to prove so unlimited in commitment and area . As Chief of Staff , Dan Callaghan had to fill in the details of the Vice Admiral 's plan . It was making bricks without straw . Ships had to be borrowed from the little Australian fleet to furnish escort and gunnery cover for the original landing . Marines had to be taken from garrison duty among the islands . There was a shortage of working space , of equipment items , and above all of officers to handle the thousand and one details of staff work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Savo Island , their surviving officers were eagerly kidnapped and plunked down at desks to handle some of the work over which Callaghan had been sitting up so Late that he grew red-eyed and unable to play his usual game of deck tennis . Savo , of course , changed everything in more than one way . " The loss of the four cruisers left us inferior in strength for several months " ? during which the officers of the South Pacific Command made even-money bets that they would shortly become another exiled government . The shifts and devices and desperate battles by which this was prevented have been told ; there is no need to repeat or to comment on them here . When help did come streaming down from the north , it came with a new admiral , Bull Halsey , with his own chief of staff . Callaghan was out of a job . ID ? UT immediately he was in another . 1 " For Halsey wanted precisely a battleship admiral , a gunnery specialist strong on offensive spirit , to lead his cruiser division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Dan 's flag went up on the San Francisco , his old ship . Early in November he took her into the troubled waters of ironbottom Bay off Guadalcanal , covering a big convoy with other ships in company ? a grouping whose strangely mixed units betray the shifts to which we were put to maintain our hold on the bloody island . There was another heavy cruiser , the Portland , with eight-inch guns ; a light cruiser , the Helena , with six-inch ; a pair of anti-aircraft cruisers , Atlanta and Juneau , with five-inch ; and eight destroyers belonging to three different classes . The story of that November 12th has been told many times ? how as the convoy lay unloading the Japs came over Florida Island with thirty-two torpedo bombers ? how the fleet formed circle and while the Grummans from Henderson Field jumped the bombers from above , the five-inch and forty-millimeter struck at them from below ? and how only a single Jap soared away up the Slot with smoke pouring from his engines and a Wildcat riding him down . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon word ran in that the enemy were coming down to Guadal with the big parade ? battleships in action for the first time in this war , with cruisers , destroyers , and numerous transports behind . We also had battleships in the South Pacific but they could not possibly get there in time . If the Japanese closed into the beach the heavy shells of their battleships would certainly knock out the Henderson Field planes as lighter ships had once so nearly done before . The transports would come in with their thirty thousand Jap troops ; there would be no way to prevent their landing ; the slender force of MAGAZINE Marines ashore , still barely sufficient to hold the line we had gained in August , would be submerged by numbers ; and the island for which so much blood and treasure had been spent would become another and worse Bataan . " Engage the enemy , " were the orders to Callaghan , whose strength was perhaps a quarter of the forces now rushing down on him . T ilt Japanese ( perhaps consciously echoing Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is difficult to fight Americans because we have no true sense of strategy . We fight , they say , at outrageous times and places under conditions no sane military man would accept . The kind of action they would have attempted off Guadalcanal under such conditions is fairly clear . There were a handful of PT boats with their torpedoes over at Tulagi ; Callaghan 's destroyers had approximately eighty torpedo tubes among them and his two anti-aircraft cruisers mounted six apiece . ' In that black night the low-slung vessels could hide under the loom of the land ; they could rush in as the enemy approached and with luck and good aim could slip enough torpedoes into the ribs of his big ships to discourage him , making their getaway with the help of speed and dark . The heavy cruisers could lie at a distance off Cape Esperance or the mouth of Lengo Channel and fire into the mess from long range . This was the convention . This was what an officer with a proper sense of ( Japanese ) strategy was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiral disposed his fleet with great skill to beat off exactly such an attack . We do not know , nor shall we ever know , whether Callaghan considered this form of action . If the idea occurred to him or was presented by one of his staff , he could hardly do anything but reject it without a second thought . It was one of those trick solutions he had so consistently avoided when executive of the Portland . Quite aside from the physical morality of ordering other men into a desperate adventure where he could not lead ? it was his province to be the leader and his flagship carried no torpedoes there was an element of intellectual dishonesty in such a failure to use the main weapon of the U.S. Navy , in whose employment he had specialized . It would have involved a denial at the intimate moment of crisis of the faith he had always held . Thus character ? morality ? by any name it is still the same ? at the crisis of Dan Callaghan 's life became the paramount issue . No more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would fight with the gun , yes , but one might as well do this thing intelligently . At any normal range the fourteen-inch shells of Japanese battleships would go through and through the sides of our lightly plated ships , while the eight-inch that were the heaviest we carried would merely produce some beautiful and rather appalling fireworks on their heavy plates . To achieve any result that would make a difference in the fate of Guadalcanal , it was necessary to get in so close that all shells would strike with the maximum velocity at which they left the muzzle , and no armor would be of any service . In an action under such conditions all chances would favor the lighter gun , which can be served more rapidly and is mounted on a platform a trifle harder to hit . Moreover such a combat would have the not inconsiderable advantage that Callaghan expected and would be prepared for it , while the Japs would not be . After the transports and supply ships had been seen clear of the area , the San Francisco turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the shores of Guadal . At one-thirty the Helena 's TBS spoke to say the enemy were coming . Dan Callaghan turned once to close the range beyond a chance of missing , shouted " Commence firing ; give ' em hell , boys ! " and the guns went off .
