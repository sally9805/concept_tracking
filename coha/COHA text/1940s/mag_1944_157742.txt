Never had the invasion of Europe from the West seemed so clearly imminent . <P> Berlin had a profound case of jitters , fished frantically for information with broadcasts and rumors planted in neutral countries : the attack would come " any minute , anywhere " ; the Atlantic Wall forces were in the " highest state of alert " ; Allied invasion craft were assembling ; Allied troops were pouring toward English ports . <P> In Britain , fairly groaning from the vast weight of men , machines and materials piled up for D-day , * there was tension . But there was also silence , behind a wall of new security regulations which had suspended even the traditional freedom of foreign diplomats ( except U.S. and Russian ) to leave the country or send code messages . Some movement might be in progress , or the enemy might be getting more of the maddening " false alarms . . . feints .. . dress rehearsals " which Winston Churchill had promised . <P> One thrust already in progress was no feint , no false alarm-the vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , which both sides recognized as a pre-invasion barrage . <P> * Commented one London barrage-balloon girl worker : " England would sink if you cut the balloons loose .
