President Truman did not like the new OPA bill but he knew that this one would have to do . He signed it " with reluctance . " He also attached a message . To the public he said that holding prices in line was as much its job as it was Government 's . To the Congress he said that if the bill and the people themselves fail to dam inflation he would call Congress back into a special session to frame a stronger act . <P> No one knew where prices might go under the new law . Much depended on the three-man OPA Decontrol Board . It would be all-powerful in determining what commodities and goods would be under price ceilings . In choosing the Board the President was expected to follow a well-grooved pattern : one member to represent labor , one to be an industry-management spokesman , one to sit for the public . But the Board named by Harry Truman fell into no such groove . The three men nominated for the $12,000 jobs were : <P> ROY LELAND THOMPSON , 55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans , tall ( 6 ft. 3 in . ) Roy Thompson has been working in Farm Credit Administration agencies since 1933 , but he is no crusader for Government controls . His aim as Chairman of the Decontrol Board : " Get things out from under price controls as quickly as possible ; if we can get production going at its proper rate , competitive force can remove the necessity of Government control . " <P> GEORGE HOUK MEAD , 68 , an Ohioan . Chairman of the $39,600.000 Mead Corp. , which he built into one of the nation 's leading papermakers , George Mead is an experienced Washington hand . From NRA days on , he has served on many Government boards , including the War Labor Board , is now an advisory member of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion . His philosophy : free enterprise . <P> His practical application of it : smooth out the extreme differences between Government and business . <P> DANIEL WAFENA BELL , 55 , Illinois-born . Until he resigned last January to join a Washington ( D.C. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 34 years , rising from a clerkship to be Under Secretary of the Treasury . Daniel Bell helped the New Deal by keeping its books . He neither embraced nor repudiated New Deal measures for controls over business . An impartial appraisal of his philosophy : the complete impartiality of a highly competent public servant . <P> After Senate confirmation , expected this week , the Board faces an unenviable task under the pressures of industry , consumers ' groups and labor . Its first job is to decide , by Aug. 20 , whether meat , milk , poultry , eggs , soybeans and cotton seed ( and all food products made from these commodities ) shall remain exempt from ceilings . As a court of last resort , it can overrule the OPA , the Department of Agriculture or any industry advisory committee on price regulation . <P> Last week Paul Porter tried to put a brave face on the law that extends rent controls and his job . But the act opened the way to rescaling of ceilings on thousands of items , and Porter warned ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on new automobile ceilings : $75 to $100 more on standard low-priced models .
