" Communist-line Lombardo had paid little heed . <P> During the past year he had consolidated his position as No. 1 Latin American labor chieftain , President of the Confederation of Latin American Workers , the only international labor union south of the border . Last December he returned from Paris as a vice president of the newly formed World Federation of Trade Unions . But immediately Lombardo got into new trouble . He charged that reactionary Sinarquistas were smuggling arms from the U.S. into Mexico , failed to furnish proofs .
