A FLASK FOR THE JOURNEY ( 307 pp. ) -F . L Green-Reynal &; Hitchcock ( $3 ) . <P> Can man find freedom as long as he is moored to society by responsibilities and to fellow men by emotions ? Or is it accessible only when he rips himself away from all human entanglements to burrow in the dark and secret catacombs of consciousness ? <P> These are the knotted questions posed by F. L. Green , a gifted English novelist , * in the second of his nine novels to appear in this country . ( Odd Man Out was the first . ) A Flask for the Journey displays Green 's novelistic technique to top advantage : his granite prose ; his talent for evoking atmospheres of disturbed feeling , bloodshot with suspense and anxiety . <P> Solitary Solution . The book reports the life stories of two young drifters , Jack Kaspan and Jane Gellson . Kaspan recalls his months as a P.W . in Germany , where at first he tried desperately to escape . But he soon discovered that the only meaningful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which the pleasures of self-absorption are unbounded . Subjected to six months ' solitary confinement because of an early attempt to escape , Kaspan learned to live so completely in his interior self-where he " could reach frontiers of consciousness beyond the outermost limits of contemporary ideas " - that he begged his Nazi captors to let him remain in his solitary hole . <P> For he was now convinced that freedom is " an ideal which can only be experienced in the recesses of the mind . . . in the silence of the heart . . . . The only way to discover absolute freedom is to become a prisoner . Yield the whole of yourself to something that will circumscribe your life . Then you 'll discover freedom . Moral , spiritual , physical . . . . " <P> Joint Bondage . Jane Gellson did not withdraw into herself ; she lived by the usual patterns of society . As a result , she was sucked into increasingly impossible situations . A sensitive young man , Bernard Meddow , fell in love with her , attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could offer him was a mild pity . For how could she tell this conventional young Englishman that she was already secretly married to a German whose whereabouts were unknown ? Meddow , Jane and her husband all suffered because of the inevitable hurts of human dependence ; each was an innocent victim of the other 's needs . And so , suggests Green , are all other human beings who bind themselves in the chains of human relationships . <P> The novel drives this despondent dogma home with such fierce insistence that readers may need a few minutes ' reflection to shake off its spell . But in the end , it will be seen that Green has trapped both Kaspan and Meddow in equally futile obsessions with absolutist quests-the one for absolute freedom and the other for absolute love . <P> <P> *Not to be confused with Graham Greene , a more gifted English novelist .
