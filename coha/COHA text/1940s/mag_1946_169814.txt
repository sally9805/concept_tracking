( See Cover ) <P> The sober , somber Council chamber was filled with the sounds of waiting : the hum-buzz of bored conversation in the gallery , the deep , snoozy breathing of weary spectators who had fallen asleep , nervous coughs , the rustling of papers . Only those with very sharp ears could hear , above these sounds in Westminster 's Central Hall , the pacing footsteps of the future . <P> At any moment , UNO-mankind 's fragile new device of peace-might fall apart beneath the weight of Russia 's postwar drive to translate victory into expansion . <P> It was almost two hours since the Security Council had adjourned for " five minutes . " The five major members , still bickering over Greece , were having it out in a back room , guarded by red-and-blue Royal Marines . Those who were waiting knew that UNO was in crisis ; few suspected how serious the crisis was . ( Behind the closed doors Britain 's bear-like 250 Ibs .

At the core of UNO 's first great test was , as many had predicted it would be , the Security Council 's veto power . Russia 's Vishinsky , in his best prosecutor 's manner , had formally accused the British of endangering the peace by maintaining an army in Greece . Bevin had bellowed Britain 's demand for clear acquittal of this charge . When it looked as though Bevin would win , Vishinsky threatened to use his veto . <P> The sweating councilors had tortured their brains and their vocabularies to contrive a verdict that was no verdict at all .

" <P> Next day , the nearly fatal deadlock was not so much broken as spiked . The U.S. 's placatory Edward R. Stettinius had produced a compromise which both London and Moscow would accept . Vishinsky was willing to drop his charges against Britain-provided that this Russian retreat was not mentioned in the Council 's official resolution . Bevin took a long , hard look at the record , decided it spoke for itself , and withdrew his demand for an explicit " not guilty . " The final statement , accepted over much relieved smiling and handshaking , merely informed the world that a debate had taken place . <P> The Russians went to bat again the morning after-this time for Indonesia . The Ukraine 's Dmitry Zakharovich Manuilsky started off mildly enough , charging on the basis of newspaper clippings that Britain was " endangering genuine national aspirations .
