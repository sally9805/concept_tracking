" Unfortunately the agreement does not provide a fleet of merchant vessels , " said one foreign-trade expert , of the first U.S.-Argentine trade treaty in 88 years , signed last week in Buenos Aires . He put his finger on one reason why the treaty , despite its political importance , was of little significance to U.S. business . There are others . <P> Greatest apparent concession gained by U.S. exporters were customs reductions in 127 items imported by Argentina , i.e. , fruits , tobacco , autos , refrigerators , industrial and farm machinery . But full reductions do not become effective until Argentina 's customs revenue is boosted 40,000,000 pesos ( $12,000,000 ) over 1940 , to a prewar , ten-year annual average of 270,000,000 pesos . Pessimists foresaw coming &; going of 1942 before that occurs . <P> Now , as for the year past , Argentina is clamoring for more U.S. products than the U.S. can ship ; her market belongs to the U.S. for the duration , pact or no pact . Chief articles wanted : autos , refrigerators , industrial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not supply even its own citizens . <P> Of 84 items imported by the U.S. on which concessions were granted , most important for Argentina were flaxseed , canned corned beef ( fresh beef is still excluded ) , cattle hides and a new set of products formerly imported from Europe ( wines , cheeses , anchovies , etc . ) . The 50% cut on canned-beef tariff ( from 6 to 3 per Ib. ) aroused the usual speaking-for-the-record opposition by beef-State Congressmen , but it meant little . Said J. Taylor , president of the Texas &; Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association : <P> " We 're not tickled to death . . . nor are we greatly worried . . . . We do n't believe it will result in any increased consumption of canned beef in the U.S. The biggest effect will be cheaper prices for the Army and Navy . . . . The Government has been mighty good to the cattle man . ... If a concession to Argentina on canned beef and hides will contribute to hemispheric unity , then the cattleman is ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be terminated at any time on 30 days ' written notice , it also meant little from the longterm , post-war economic viewpoint . Two days after the signing , Argentina agreed to sell her entire exportable beef surplus ( 500,000 tons ) to Great Britain . Added to other heavy British purchases , that meant another sizable chunk of sterling credits frozen in London . When these are thawed by peace , Argentina undoubtedly will do her shopping in Europe . Supporting reasons : lower costs , better terms , partial European control of normal Argentine trade . <P> But for the State Department , and for stubborn old Secretary Hull , the treaty was a triumph . At every Pan American Conference since Mr. Hull 's visit to Montevideo in 1933 , Argentina has found it to her best interests not to follow through on hemisphere solidarity . What the State Department had almost despaired of doing , World War II did . <P> Said pleased Franklin Roosevelt in a message to Ramn S. Castillo , Acting President of Argentina : " In the years to come we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monument to the ways of peace . . . . "
