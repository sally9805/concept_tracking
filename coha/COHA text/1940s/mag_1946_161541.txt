The man everyone was watching in next week 's Minnesota primary was sitting on the sidelines . Harold Stassen had risked a small loss against a major gain in Nebraska-and missed ( TIME , June 24 ) . Now , in his home state , he was staking his political future and his chances for the GOPresidential nomination in 1948 on the belief that his handpicked Governor , Ed Thye , could beat four-term isolationist Senator Henrik Shipstead for the G.O.P. senatorial nomination . <P> At the start it had looked like a shoo-in for the Stassen camp . There was so much rejoicing that " Harold is home again , " so much confidence in the prestige he had gained at the San Francisco Conference , so much faith in the appeal of the Stassen war record as Admiral Halsey 's flag secretary that it seemed nothing could go wrong . <P> Besides , Ed Thye was a formidable vote-getter in his own right . Friendly , honest , an able administrator and an indefatigable campaigner in smalltown , door-to-door electioneering , he had piled up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Governor 's chair in 1944 . Purring with power , the Stassen machine coasted easily . <P> In the early weeks of listless campaigning , the confidence seemed well-placed . There were no fireworks , no weighty speeches , no burning issues . Amiable Ed Thye and his running-mate , gubernatorial candidate Luther Youngdahl , toured the back country , slapping backs , shaking hands , remembering faces . In the Minneapolis Tribune polls , Thye 's popularity climbed : from 61% to 62% to 67% . <P> " Hearty Feed . " But by last week Stassenites suddenly realized that they might be heading for a sharp comeuppance . Despite published polls , reports from district leaders and the gossip of professional politicos showed that shrewd old Henrik Shipstead had been retrieving ground fast , might even be edging ahead . <P> In 24 careful years in Washington , silver-shocked Senator Shipstead has learned to avoid controversial domestic subjects , has never signed his name to any important piece of legislation . But he has remembered to look out for his constituents . He blatantly promised " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed . " Originally a Republican , he paid no attention to party lines . Minnesota had first sent him to the Senate as a Farmer-Laborite , returned him twice on that ticket , finally as a Republican again . <P> His intransigent isolationism was no handicap in the German and Scandinavian areas of Minnesota , where isolationism is still a potent political force . Instead of trying to whitewash his record on foreign affairs , he made no bones of the fact that he and North Dakota 's Bill Langer had cast the only votes in the Senate against U.N . Rural voters nodded approval . <P> But he saved his biggest rocks for Harold Stassen . Trumpeting " dictatorship , " Shipstead hinted at " small , select , secret meetings " with the " bosses in the East . " Cried he : " They have prostituted the primary . . . Stassen must have eaten pretty red meat at his luncheons and dinners on his trips to New York . "                 @ @ @ @
