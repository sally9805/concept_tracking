txt The shift from war to peace , failing to muster an army of unemployed on U S. streets , has left the nation with a roll of unemployment insurance cash sevenfold as fat as in pre-war 1940 ' The ripple of unemployment following V-J Day hardly made a nick in it . Totaling $6.9 billion on September 1 last year . the huge reserve fund stood at $6.7 billion at the end of July this year . Amounting to an anemic $980 million in 1940 , five years after the Social Security Act was passed , the fund fattened like a hog on corn as plump war-plant payrolls were tapped for deductions . In 1941. and 1992 money coming into the fund roughly quadtrupled that doled out in benefit payments . 1ln 1943-41 receipts were 20 times benefit pay-ments A Wall Street Journal survey of unemployment insurance officials in the nation 's capital and nine industrial states as the co , ..

But benefit claims have slumped sharply in recent month : , and : are still falling . Unemployment cempensaI Lion rolls ( this does not include G I. 52-20 Club members ) after hitting a post-war peak of 1,785,425 in March had skidded to 968,000 by late last month . So the big . close-to-$T-Billion fund rolls calmly on . practically undisturbed by reconversion . But another depression similar to that which pounded the country 's economy a little more than a decade ago might give the huge cache a severe jolt . It would certainly be an incomparably greater impact than that felt since the war ended . Vrieniployffient since Hirohito threw.in the towel has ranged from a March peak of 2.7 million to a current level around 2.2. million .

Employment Fattens Fund Should such a bleak era occur , the fund would be hit from two directions . As out . payments rose , receipts would tumble Jobs mean payrolls . And payrolls mean contramUons to the fund . Some 58 million people are employed now . But one of every three , or some 20 million in all , would be lopped off if employment plummeted to the 1932-33 level of 38 million . Barring a severe depression , however , the big , war-inflated fund seems destined to remain far out of proportion to demands upon it for unemployment benefit payments . At 1941 's pre-war annual benefit payment rate of $344 million , the fund apparently ' could pass out unemployment relief for 20 long years even though not another dime were brought into it by collections . With demand for manpower at its highest level in history , unemployment insurance officials say they do n't think many people are loafing on benefit payments instead of seeking Jobs . And the dollar amount of individual payments supports that position , when present living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly benefit payments , which vary slightly from state to state , averaged $19.03 for the country an a whole . Factory into , today pay an average of about $42 weekly . People Prefer - lobs " We 've found that people get off the ben ' efit rolls fast when jobs do open up . " says I a Social Security Administration spokesman in Washington , " There 's been a very meld turnover on the rolls A high proportion of those drawing benefits do n't last out t is full waiting period during which they can collect compensation . " Unemployment compensation administrators in the various states echo this sentiment . " With industry wages at current high levels , " declares a Pennsylvania administrator . " unemployed persons are not remaini.ig on compensation any longer than they have to . So long as wages remain high , unemployment compensation does not discourage people from seeking jobs " This statement suggests , quite logically , that the disposition to loaf on $19-a-week unemployment benefits might become sharply more pronounced should industrial wag. a fall . The average weekly factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pre-war 1940 it was only $25 . Employers Want Younger People Much of today 's apparent paradox Involved in " 90-cent-an-hour jobs going begging " while many draw unemployment conc. pensation is explained by the fact that many factories do not hire new men over 45 years old or women over 35 . " Over 53,4 : of the men and 55% of the women drawing unemployment compensation in Illinois , " says an administrator in Chicago , " are above 45 and 35 years of age respectively . " In Portland . Oregon . an official referred to a list of individuals who had drawn compensation for 10 consecutive weeks . " About 45% of them are women , " he said , " and only 10% of the men on the list are under 45 ? years of age . Many officials refer to abuse of unemployment insurance by women  --  women who. with their husbands home from the war , have actually withdrawn front the labor market but continue to collect benefits tinder the pretense of continuing to look for work . " We know there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco official . " But a tvg percentage of them have already received maximum payments and will not recur as claimants in the future. - Want More Claims Examiners Some unemployment insurance offices be , wail the want of more claims examiners on their staffs to help them winnow out house ' wives and others fraudulently extending their ! hands for benefit money . " Many claims we question have to go through for lack of men to go into the back ' ground thoroughly . ' sighs a San Francisco office spokesman . " We could use 50'l , more ' examiners right away . " There are many bona fide benefit claimants on the rolls who qualified for unemployment insurance by doing special war lobs but who now simply do not have skills which can fit them into work in their communities . This lack of skill is mentioned over and over by unemployment insurance officials . " Employers are getting more choosey , " emphasizes a Seattle administrator .

A lot of them are boys snatched young into the Army before they were old enough to acquire any specialized training . Naturally . these are offered the lowest paying jobs . Also naturally , many are hesitant about taking them . . But loafing by veterans on unemployment insurance or readjustment payments ( $20 weekly for 52 weeks available to ex-service men i has been overpublicized beyond its existence say the men who keep the records . A Chicago spokesman backs his point thus : " Of the 304.000 Illinois vets claiming readjustment pay between V-E Day and July 13 this year . 215.000 had stopped drawing this pay by the latter date . And of those who dropped off the rolls less than 0 .. 3 had exhausted their readjustment allowances . '
