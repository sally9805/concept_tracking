Roman Catholic , Greek Orthodox , Jewish , Protestant and Moslem faiths , and be responsible to the Security Council . The commission would have the right to employ guards to carry out its responsibilities , and the fact that " any breach of the agreelinents respecting the Holy Pieces could thus automatically invoke the action of the Security Council " would itself be a " potent deterrent , " the letter said .
