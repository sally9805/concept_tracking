There is little malnutrition among the children of Spain ; they just do n't get enough to eat . This cool distinction came last week from the slums of Madrid , where a Rockefeller Foundation project studies the nutrition of poor families . <P> Each family is examined for a week . On Monday morning , Dr. William D. Robinson and a group of Spanish nurses take inventory of the amount of food in the house , make a list of what is purchased ; on Tuesday , and daily thereafter , the garbage ( if any ) is measured and studied . At the beginning and end of the week , after all food consumption has been checked , each member of the family is weighed and given a blood test . Their reward for cooperation : two pounds of Red Cross flour or a can of condensed milk . <P> Said a Rockefeller researcher last week : " Giving vitamins to the children of Spain would help hardly at all . What they need I is not better quality , but more quantity - something to stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more vegetables . From our study so far , we have found little evidence of pellagra , little lack of vitamins A and C. " Though the Spaniards may not have time to appreciate the difference , " technically they die of undernourishment , not malnutrition . "
