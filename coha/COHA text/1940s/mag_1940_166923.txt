Few years ago a psychologist named Harold Manville Skeels , a professor at University of Iowa , was assigned by the State to advise the State orphanage . He found that the orphanage was sending babies ( mostly bastards ) born of feeble-minded parents to highly intelligent families for adoption . Horrified , Dr. Skeels hurried forth to see how much damage had been done . He gave the adopted children intelligence tests . To his surprise , their average I.Q. was 115 , well above normal ( 100 ) . Not one was dull . <P> Dr. Skeels 's discovery was one of a series made more or less by chance during the last 15 years by the University of Iowa 's Child Welfare Research Station . The Station found that when children attended a nursery school or were transferred from a bleak orphanage to a good home , their I.Q.s invariably improved . Concluded the Station 's director , Dr. George Dinsmore Stoddard : with good upbringing even a dull child may become bright . <P> Dr. Stoddard 's conclusions threw other psychologists into a dither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , an intelligent man and wife should adopt children instead of having their own . " Retorted Dr. Stoddard : " Their chances of getting bright kids would be just about as good . " <P> Last week , with blood in their eyes , the nation 's leading psychologists gathered in St. Louis . On their way to the meeting-the annual convention of the National Society for the Study of Education-they read both sides of the controversy in the Society 's yearbook , Intelligence : Its Nature and Nurture ( Public School Publishing Co. , Bloomington , Ill. ; two volumes ; $3.50 ) . <P> Said Stanford 's famed Psychologist Lewis Terman : " It appears characteristic of the Iowa group of workers that they . . . find difficulty in reporting accurately either the data of others or their own . " Miss Florence L. Goodenough , of University of Minnesota 's Institute of Child Welfare , claimed that Dr. Stoddard 's investigators had made technical errors . <P> But Dr. Stoddard had found supporters . The yearbook reported that identical twins reared in separate homes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus got better schooling ) raised their I.Q.s . Psychologist Robert Ladd Thorndike ( son of famed Edward Lee Thorndike ) had examined the records of some 1,100 children in three famed progressive schools ( Horace Mann , Lincoln , Ethical Culture ) , found that in two schools children 's I.Q.s were static , but in the third ( unidentified ) there was an average I.Q. gain of more than six points . <P> As the convention opened , bald , husky Dr. Stoddard rose to report . He twinkled : " Only a confirmed Pollyanna would say that , as a committee , we have performed our task in a spirit of loving kindness . ... " Listeners looked at each other , wondered when the fireworks would start . They never did start . Long before the end it had dawned on the delegates that there would be no debate , because no one cared to get up and contend that nurture had nothing to do with intelligence . Said the final speaker , University of Chicago 's Sociologist Ernest Watson Burgess : " The consensus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not a constant and that it is a resultant both of hereditary and environmental factors .
