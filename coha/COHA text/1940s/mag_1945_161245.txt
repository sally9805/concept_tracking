HOTELS The Biggest <P> A lank , hard-bargaining hotelman named Conrad Nicholson Hilton , 59 , longed to own something really big . Inevitably , his gaze fell upon the world 's biggest hotel : Chicago 's 2,700-room Stevens . Last week , for $7,500,000 , Innkeeper Hilton proudly added the Chicago colossus to his string of 13 hotels ( including Manhattan 's Plaza and Roosevelt , and Los Angeles ' swank Town House ) . <P> Many another hotelman grinned when he remembered the Stevens ' reputation as one of the world 's outstanding peacetime white elephants ( chief disadvantage : the Stevens is not convenient to the heart of Chicago 's Loop ) . But they had enough respect for Hilton 's reputation as a mon eymaker to predict that he would make even the Stevens pay . <P> Connie Hilton loves to color a white elephant . His technique , with hotels less lively than the Stevens , has been to humanize them according to Hilton standards , to free them of the dead , half-lit , intimate air . His chief bid is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade of the hometown folks . <P> Music &; Laughter . A Hilton hotel has never lost money . But some have lost a good deal of their old face and manner . In its aloof pre-Hilton days , Los Angeles ' Town House frightened merry transients away with its forbidding , exclusive atmosphere . Then , in 1942 , came Hilton . Out went the haughty air . In came bright flowers , elaborate bars , hot music and floor shows . Employes were instructed to stop freezing guests and make them feel at home . Soon Hilton 's old Texas friends and others long awed by the Town House began to make it their California headquarters . Up went the profits . <P> Five-Room Start . When Connie Hilton was 16 , he was managing a five-room inn for traveling salesmen over his father 's general store in San Antonio , Socorio County , N. Mex. ( pop . 760 ) . The rent money put him through college . At 21 , Hilton was elected to New Mexico 's House of Representatives . He enlisted with the break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fought in France . <P> In 1919 , he bought the Mobeley Hotel in Cisco , Tex. , on the eve of the Texas oil boom . This deal set the future Hilton pattern-step in when the boom is starting and the property value low , make it pay , unload at the peak . He applied this pattern to a long series of small Texas and New Mexico hotels , putting the profits of one into the purchase price of the next . <P> In 1923 , Hilton built his first " mini-max " ( maximum hospitality , minimum cost ) hotel , and started out to become a Western legend . In Texas horse-trader fashion , he bought and sold more than two dozen hotels , naming most of them after himself , finally built the chain that has brought him an estimated fortune of $28,000,000 and made him one of the ranking men in the U.S. hotel business. * As a hotelman , Hilton has relied heavily on four attributes : 1 ) tremendous energy ( he can get by with four hours ' sleep ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good employes ; 3 ) a knack with figures ; 4 ) a sincere love of playing host .
