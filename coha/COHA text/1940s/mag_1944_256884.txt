What makes a good college teacher ? How can colleges be sure that they are promoting a teacher on his merits ? <P> The University of Washington believes that it can now answer both these questions with a precision heretofore unknown on U.S. campuses . Now ready for use , the new plan lets the teacher be judged by his own colleagues . They in turn are guided by standards which the Washington faculty as a whole laid down in answer to a recent questionnaire . The novel application of these standards was worked out by Dean Edwin Ray Guthrie , recently chief consultant psychologist on the U.S. Army General Staff . <P> Twinkle-eyed , 58-year-old Dean Guthrie recognizes that his five-man jury of the candidate 's colleagues is not an innovation . What is new is the way his jury works . Guthrie 's advisory committees of five will never meet except on paper , thus avoiding faculty politics and personal salesmanship . Committee members will rate the candidate privately , on a nine-point scale which evaluates , in order of decreasing weight , his : 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) university activities , 4 ) value to the community , 5 ) cooperation , 6 ) grasp of his field , 7 ) general range of interest , 8 ) current rate of professional growth , 9 ) recognition by his profession . <P> A teacher 's students may also have a say in his promotion . If the candidate wishes , they will be asked to rate him on the following points : 1 ) grasp of his field , 2 ) clarity of classroom exposition , 3 ) interest in his classes ' progress , 4 ) friendliness of manner , 5 ) enthusiasm for his subject .
