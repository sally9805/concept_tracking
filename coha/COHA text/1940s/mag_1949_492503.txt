PART ONE RLY one evening recently the United States Coast Guard Cutter Sauk , surrounded by thick fog and anchored off the Quarantine Station in the Narrows of New York Harbor , was awaiting the delayed arrival of the Queen Elizabeth , the world 's largest ship , which was fogbound ten miles farther out in the roadstead beyond Ambrose Light . The Elizabeth 's master , who does n't like to , rely on radar entirely , would not risk bringing the big ship in through a fog that had cut visibility to fifty yards or less . The Elizabeth , which is four fifths as long as the Empire State Building is high , might graze and capsize a ferryboat packed with pas-sengers or she might slice in two some big freighter , as her sister ship , the Queen Mary , once did to a British cruiser that got in her way during the war . So the Lizzie had anchored outside the harbor at three A.M. , and was waiting for the fog to lift . She had been due to dock at Pier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now it was 7:30 e.m . Already the Elizabeth was twelve hours late . Aboard her , some 2200 passengers , including three ambassadors , a sprinkling of movie stars , some European church dignitaries , a French dancer or two , a soccer team from Liverpool , a juggler who said he had not seen Broadway in seventeen years , and sundry other notables fumed and swore or composed themselves to the delay as an act of providence , according to their natures . Aboard the Sauk things were even more dismal . About ninety passengers , ineluding United States immigration and customs officials , ship-news reporters , photographers and newsreel cameramen , crowded her narrow decks , and bitterly cursed the fog , fate , their jobs and Cunard White Star , Limited , owners of the Queen Elizabeth , the Queen Mary and other lesser ships . They had been aboard the cutter since 5:30 A.M. , and were weary , sunburned , hungry , thirsty and disgusted . A Coast Guard cutter meets every large passenger ship at Quarantine and puts aboard customs and immigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also newsmen and photogof hooting and snorting and ringing of bells to let the approaching monster know their whereabouts in the gloom . The reaction among the Sauk 's passengers was even more striking . The poker game in the cabin broke up and the players came out to listen to the Lizzie . Newsmen , who a few minutes before had been damning her , became excited and started guessing where she was in the fog , judging from the whistle blasts . Immigration and customs men , who had been meeting ships for twenty-five years , lined the rail and stared into the fog like men who had never seen a ship . It 's a Great Day for the Statisticians IN spite of their alleged callousness , the news and Government men had behaved as most people do when confronted , under slightly dramatic circumstances , with the biggest thing of its kind in the world . The people of New York , who like to consider themselves sophisticated , have never got over being thrilled by the Queens , although New Yorkers have been observing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Mary 's for twelve . When one of the Queens is docked there  --  one or the other is usually at Pier 90 two days each week  --  a series of traffic problems develops during the rush hour on the West Side Highway along the Hudson as motorists slow down to ogle the big ships , thus causing congestion . Sometimes a hardened New , Yorker becomes so engrossed in looking at a Queen that he will run his car into a guardrail or into another automobile . Whenever a Queen is in port , the offices of Cunard White Star , Ltd. , receive telephone calls from people who offer advice and criticism and make inquiries . Callers will inform Cunard , perhaps , that a gob of mud is clinging to the tip of an anchor , which is not regarded as becoming to a Queen , or that some paint has been scraped off the port bow . Calls like that have caused the company , as soon as convenient after docking , to send a crew with hoses and paintbrushes to freshen up the Queens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complain about what they take to be broomsticks and fishing poles protruding from the lower ports . The Cunard people do nothing about this ; since the protrusions actually are homemade radio aerials which crew members on watch below decks use to catch the New York dance hands . The two Queens are standard subjects for barroom bets , and Cunard receives a lot of calls from slightly inebriated gentlemen who wish to have some important matter under debate cleared up . Cunard 's Publicity Department has considered assigning some expert as official betting referee to settle such matters as : The Elizabeth  --  length 1031 feet , breadth 118 feet , gross tonnage 83,673 , passenger capacity 2314 ? is larger than the Mary ? length 1021 feet , breadth 118 feet , gross tonnage 81,235 , passenger capacity 1995 . Both Queens are more than three times the size of the S.S. America-26,314 tons , passenger capacity 1047 . The main engines on the Queens produce as much power as forty modern passenger locomotives , and the current each ship generates is enough to supply the lighting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Jacksonville , Florida . Each anchor weighs as much as twelve average-size automobiles , and the 160-ton rudder on each ship weighs almost as much as the Mayflower did . The household equipment on each Queen includes more than 500,000 pieces of china , glassware and silver , sufficient vacuum cleaners to sweep six miles of carpet each day , and linen supplies consisting of 210,000 towels , 30,000 sheets , 31,000 pillowcases , 21,000 tablecloths and 92,000 napkins . The funnels on each Queen are large enough in diameter so that three locomotives could run through them abreast , and the outdoor deck space on each devoted to sport is slightly larger than the ground space in the Yale Bowl . The distance from the keel to the top of the funnels on each Queen is eighteen feet higher than Niagara Falls . The Queen Mary holds the speed record for both east and west Atlantic crossings , both having been established in 1938 . She did it from Bishop 's Rock on the southern tip of England to Ambrose Light in three days , twenty-one hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bishop 's Rock in three days , twenty hours and forty-two minutes . This shattered the speed record that had been held briefly by the French Line 's Normandie . The principal differences in the two Queens are that the Elizabeth has two stacks , the Mary three ; the Elizabeth has fourteen decks , the Mary twelve . The Elizabeth has thirty-six elevators , the Mary twenty-one . The Elizabeth has three anchors , the Mary two . The Mary has a break in the hull forward , known as a well deck , while the Elizabeth has a flush deck . This extra enclosed space accounts for most of the tonnage by which the Elizabeth exceeds the Mary . It requires thirty tons of paint to cover each Queen , and the ship 's gardener on each spends eight hours a day watering potted plants . Outside of their sheer size , one reason why the Queens arouse so much public interest is that people associate them with glamour . Probably more important people have traveled on the Queens than on any other ships in history . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen or so newsworthy people aboard . A person traveling on one of the Queens in recent months would have been apt to bump into fellow passengers ranging from the Bishop of London to Wallace Beery , from Percy Grainger to the Goldwyn Girls , C. S. Forester and I. J. Fox , Babe Didrikson Zaharias and Hattie Carnegie , Margaret O'Brien and Sophie Tucker , Walter Lippmann and Joe Louis , Kirsten Flagstad and Martha Raye , Jascha Heifetz and Gracie Fields , Lord Beaverbrook and Mickey Rooney , Henry Cabot Lodge , Jr. , and Chico Marx , Mrs. Roosevelt and Sax Rohmer , the Duke of Marlborough and the Maharaja of Baroda , Greta Garbo and Dr. George Gallup , V. M. Molotov and John Jacob Astor , Eric Johnston and Mae West . Outside of a few notables who keep pretty well under cover while aboard ? the Duke and Duchess of Windsor never dine in the main restaurant , and the Duke has his hair trimmed in the ship 's barbershop at 7:30 P.M. , half an hour after the shop has closed ? most celebrities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like other people . Ex-King Michael of Rumania , for example , was all over the ship when he sailed recently on the Mary . Michael , who is interested in machinery , spent a lot of time examining the engines . Once , when the projector in the cinema broke down , Michael , who was present , ducked into the projection booth and repaired the machine . Times Have Changed on the High Seas Too SOMETIMES celebrities are a problem , particularly the Hollywood contingent , who often arrive at the last minute before sailing , which causes officials of the line to gnaw their fingernails . Something of that sort happened when Mrs. Nancy Hawks , estranged wife of Howard Hawks , motion-picture producer , came aboard the Queen Mary to say good-by to Clark Gable , who was sailing . Mrs. Hawks said such a lengthy good-by before leaving the ship that the deck superintendent screamed with rage , and some newspapermen got the impression that the Hawks-Gable farewells had delayed the Mary 's departure . The Cunard people denied this , but admitted that Mrs. Hawks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high percentage of celebrities sailing on the Queens these days , voyages are not so gay and carefree as those before the war . The majority of those sailing are middle-aged people traveling on business or to visit relatives , and they have n't the inclination to make whoopee ; Britons and Europeans coming to the United States have n't the money . There is not so much drinking as of yore , and ship 's officers rarely get appeals from slightly drunken women to investigate another woman 's room in search of a missing husband . The gamblers , who used to inhabit big liners , have n't made an appearance since the war . Members of the ships ' orchestras , anticipating that traveling Americans would be all set to raise hell when the Queens resumed service after the war , were primed to give them bebop and other forms of wild music . They found , instead , that Americans are more interested in waltzes , tunes from light opera and folk music . Britons and Europeans have achieved during and since the war a great reverence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper interest in the restaurants than in the bars . Night sailings from New York these days do not have the glamour of those of the 1920 's and the 1930 's , which were notable for crowds in evening clothes , ermine , sable and mink , with plenty of flowers and champagne . Most of the bon-voyage boxes that . come aboard nowadays do n't contain dainties , but solid foods that are hard to get in England . And hardly anybody shows up for a sailing in evening clothes . " It used to be candy and flowers at embarkations , " one old-time steward remarked not long ago . " Now it 's grub . You know , Lady Astor sailed with me a trip or so ago . Fussy old girl ; called me every morning at six o'clock to awsk if I could cool the temperature of the swim pool down to sixty degrees for her morning swim . Anyway , Lady Astor came aboard here at New York with forty-eight pieces of luggage , and I think most of it was grub she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost breaks my back . Must have weighed ' alf a ' undredweight . And do you know what was in it ? ' Ams . Imagine Lady Astor carrying around a bunch of blinkin " ams . " Most Britons , peer and commoner , who come to the United States these days , go home with as much food as possible . Stewards on the Queens believe that this is the first time during the era of modern ocean travel that a man taking a $2000 suite is apt to include in his baggage a case of eggs . Lord Inverchapel , retiring British ambassador to the United States , cut short a press conference an hour before sailing on one of the Queens some time ago , so that he could rush over to 11th Avenue and buy a sack of sugar and a side of bacon . Sir Hartley Shawcross , attorney general of Great Britain , was the last passenger to get aboard the Queen Elizabeth at one sailing from New York . He had been waiting on the pier for the delivery of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind three hams and his passport , which were hauled aboard at the last minute in a canvas sack as the Queen was backing away from the pier . In the view of the British crew members , the most attractive feature of a berth on the Queens these days is the opportunity each two weeks to buy food in New York for their families at home . All of them , from captains to bellboys , take advantage of this opportunity . They usually buy such items as sugar , chocolate , bacon , coffee and cooking fats . The chief master-at-arms  --  chief of police ? on the Queen Elizabeth always buys two dozen duck eggs . He says he likes boiled duck eggs . The Queens themselves take on 95 per cent of their stores in New York , from the most important item , 1,700 , - 000 gallons of fuel oil  --  enough for the trip to Southampton and back  --  on down to fifty pounds of mint leaves for making juleps and garnishes . About the only stores put aboard in England are several British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fish ; and the water tanks are replenished . The Queens ' fresh-water tanks hold about 1,600,000 gallons , which is a lot more water than is needed on a voyage . Passengers use some 12,000 gallons a day for drinking , brushing teeth and such , and about 120,000 gallons for bathing . The excess water serves as ballast . When one of the Queens leaves New York with its full stores of fuel , water and food and a full load of passengers she rides thirty-nine feet deep in the water . When she returns with the same number of passengers , but with fuel and food stores depleted and part of the water gone , she draws thirty-six feet of water . Occasionally , when one of the Queens is delayed at sea because of . bad weather , she has to make a twenty-four-hour turn-around in New York to maintain her schedule . This feat has proved a source of amazement to old seafaring men . In the twenty-four hours the Queen must disembark her passengers and their baggage . It takes about six hours after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ashore . On an average trip a Queen will bring around 1000 trunks , 6000 suitcases and 2000 miscellaneous parcels which must be unloaded , and a like number loaded for the return trip . The thirty-five public rooms and apProximately 1200 staterooms must be cleaned , the decks washed , the brass Polished , while 100,000 pieces of soiled linen must be removed from the ship and replaced by 100,000 pieces of clean linen . It requires sixteen hours of steady Pumping to fill the oil and water tanks , and about fourteen hours to put the food stores aboard . The eastbound passengers are given two hours to get aboard , and by that time the twenty-four hours are up and the Queen is ready to leave . All this activity is carried on over nine gangways for passengers and crews , and ten escalators built on gangways , and by six cargo winches that handle heavy trunks and freight from the hold . Each gangway has a certain place along the 1200-foot pier , Which means that to make each fit into Its proper door in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact spot alongside the pier each time they dock , with a tolerance of scarcely two feet . A lot of people ca n't do that Well with an automobile . Berthing is done with the help of tugs  --  ten in good weather and as many as fifteen when there is a high wind . The tugs push at the bow and pull at the stern until the big ships are in place broadside of the pier . This operation , , Which usually takes about half an hour , is ticklish because if one of the Queens were allowed to bang against the pier , she would likely knock the pier over or at least weaken its underpinnings . This brings up probably the greatest feat of navigation ever achieved by one of the Queens . Several years ago the Queen Mary arrived in New York in the midst of a tugboat strike . Her master berthed her , then took her out again two days later without the help of any tugs . He used only the ship 's power , and he did n't scratch any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people say this was possible only because weather conditions were ideal . The most complicated part of loading one of the Queens is putting aboard enough food to serve 100,000 meals-10,000 meals a day , including meals for the crew ? during the voyage to Southampton and back . Contractors supplying the food are told ahead of time the exact location on the pier where they are to send their trucks . The Queens ' refrigeration plants contain some 60,000 cubic feet  --  about the space in 15,000 family-sized iceboxes  --  and food must be stored according to plan . It would cause a terrible mixup in the kitchens if the Long Island duckling were loaded ahead of the flounders or if the parsnips went aboard ahead of the iceberg lettuce . Tinned foods are loaded first , then cereals , then nonperishable vegetables , staples , perishable vegetables , meats , poultry , fish , eggs , milk and ice cream . A few of the more than 400 food items that were put aboard the Queen Elizabeth for a recent voyage included 10,000 pounds of white flour , 50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000 pounds of sugar , 120 gallons of vinegar , 3600 pounds of cheese , 10,000 pounds of ham and bacon , 3500 pounds of butter , 64,800 eggs , 12,000 pounds of fresh fish  --  forty-four kinds-5000 clams , 1000 lobsters , fifty pounds of smoked eels , 102 TILE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 5 , 1919 2000 quarts of ice cream  --  thirty-two kinds  --  twenty tons of meat , 3000 pounds of onions , 150 pounds of horseradish and ten pounds of garlic . The Queens advertise an international cuisine featuring American , English and French dishes , and there is a special kosher kitchen for orthodox Jews . A few gourmets have complained that the cooking is inclined to be a bit too heavy and on the British side , adding that since the war there are not the exotic French dishes featured in prewar years . There may be some truth in this , but most American voyagers eat better on the Queens than they do anywhere else , and to Britons and Europeans the food is heavenly . In fact , some travelers from England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war and unaccustomed to cream , sugar , butter and rich meats , ca n't take it . Their stomachs have been so long without these foods that they get sick and ca n't eat after the first day . This is true in the swank first-class restaurant with its mahogany walls and chandeliers as well as down in the low-ceilinged tourist-class restaurant with its multitude of high chairs for small children . Around 400 immigrants come over tourist class on each westbound trip . To them , the menus are almost unbelievable . Some Central Europeans would be perfectly happy with nothing but white bread and butter , which they have not seen since before the war . Most of them collect as many rolls as possible at the table , wrap them in napkins and take them to their rooms to enjoy between meals . " Give them plenty of rolls and butter , " the tourist-class stewards say . " They eat them like cake . " The sight of ice cream is almost too much for some of the immigrants . When they have finished a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English will sit and look at the stewards with a doglike appeal in their eyes . The stewards know what they mean , and usually dish up another helping . " When you give them a second helping , " a steward said recently , " they act as though you 'd handed them a plate of gold . " Passengers in the first-class restaurant who do not fancy anything on the menu can order , without extra cost , anything available on the ship , from corned-beef hash to guinea hen under glass . Most special orders are given by Americans , who generally want English mutton chops , thick steaks , lobsters , grilled chicken or baked Alaska . The kitchens are manned by 126 cooks under five chefs . The cooks work a ten-hour day , but they do not consider preparing 10,000 meals a day a particularly big job compared with their work during the war , when the Queens served as troopships , staffed by Cunard employees , and sometimes carried an entire division of 15,000 officers and men . In those days each Queen had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with the same size kitchen staff that now feeds the passenger trade , although the cooks were assisted during the war by eighty soldiers , who cleaned vegetables , scrubbed pots and brought up stores . In those days each Queen would serve 30,000 eggs for breakfast and 3000 pounds of bacon . Five tons of bread and five tons of potatoes were consumed at every meal , and 17,000 servings of ice cream were dished out to the 15,000 soldiers . The chefs could never figure what happened to the extra 2000 servings . If the company cared to , it could probably do a large catering business by serving dinners and banquets while the Queens are in port in New York . Wealthy families sometimes try to arrange for weddings , parties or receptions to be held aboard one of the Queens , and social organizations have sought to hold balls there . Veterans ' organizations sometimes ask to hold reunions aboard ; swank shops would like to hold fashion shows on the Queens , and large firms have sought permission to entertain prominent business connections aboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an agreement with the Hotel Association of New York City to allow no entertaining aboard while the ships are in New York waters . Sometimes the company gets requests from firms and individuals who want permission to do various peculiar things aboard , apparently for reasons of publicity . The Cunard people turn down as " too sensational " requests such as one large department store made recently to land a helicopter on the deck of the Queen Elizabeth while at sea , and deliver something or other to some notable aboard . Cunard thought this not only sensational but dangerous . Probably the weirdest request received to date came from Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson , of Hellzapoppin ' fame . 0 . and J. , who were about to sail to England , wanted to bring a cow aboard . Cunard turned this down sharply , saying it was " undignified publicity " and there were " other obvious objections . " No one ever learned why Olsen and Johnson wanted the COW . The company 's high brass , who dwell in Liverpool , are as conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view any publicity as slightly vulgar and a bit silly . Company officials in New York have managed to convince them  --  at least partly  --  that publicity is of great value in the United States , but the English directors  --  no one but Britons may buy Cunard stock  --  point out that business is good out of England , and over there they pay no attention to the press whatever . However , the directors have allowed press rooms to be built in the Queens for use of reporters during arrivals at New York , and even provide refreshments for the press , including sandwiches , coffee , beer , rye and Scotch , in limited quantities . if the press is aboard at mealtime , the photographers and reporters are entertained in the main restaurant . Despite the attitude of the British directors , Cunard probably gets more mention in the press than all the other lines combined . The reason is that the Queens carry so many prominent people in and out of New York . Furthermore , the Queens have so taken the American public 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered news . Sir Oliver Franks , British ambassador to the United States , arrived last summer on the Queen Elizabeth with his wife and two daughters , but one member of the household was missing ? a ginger-colored Persian cat named Lulu , which had managed somehow to escape from her cage in the ship 's kennels two days out of Southampton . Ship 's officers regarded this as a terrible calamity , and alerted the entire crew , but Lulu has not been found nor the mystery of her escape explained . But because she chose to escape aboard the Elizabeth , she became one of the most publicized cats in the world . She was a national story for several days , and even rated three quarters of a column on the editorial page of The New York Times . When they read such goings on in the American press , Cunard officials in Liverpool become more and more mystified about all this publicizing of the Queens . They appear to think that it is nice , but hardly necessary . After all , they reason , Cunard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the people of the United States ought to know that without constantly having to read about the Queens . Cunard has maintained its position for the past 108 years through that sort of stolid thinking , plus hardheaded business sense which is not deflected by sentiment . Company officials feel misunderstood whenever anyone asks if Cunard did not build the Queens , with the help of a government loan , to keep the French from having in the Normandie a far larger ship than anything the British had . Cunard says the Mary and the Elizabeth were conceived with the idea of providing weekly transatlantic passenger express service with only two ships . " Instead of trying to build the largest and fastest ships in the world in the Mary and the Elizabeth , " a Cunard official once said , " we built the smallest and slowest ships that would do what we wanted , which was to maintain a weekly service with only two ships . " Cunard has five other passenger ships operating between the United States and England , but they are smaller than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated its hardheadedness during the war , when all large passenger ships of the Allied nations , including the Queens , were serving as troop transports . Naval service clubs and other wartime social organizations asked the various steamship lines to " lend " them some of the peacetime furniture of their ships , which was in storage ashore . Some lines did so . The furniture of the United States Lines ' America was widely lent , and never came back . Today it adorns living rooms from Omaha to Bangor and from Oshkosh to Dallas . As a consequence , the United States Lines had a tough job refurnishing the America and getting her back in the passenger business when the war was over . Cunard refused to lend a stick of its furniture to anybody , no matter how worthy the cause . The company stored it in warehouses about the world , after having the hundreds of expensive chairs , tables , rugs , beds , sofas and paintings wrapped in cotton wool . This did not endear the line to service clubs , but when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as good as new . That is why the Queen Elizabeth was the first passenger ship in the world to be reconverted to the peacetime luxury trade after the war . She made her maiden voyage as a luxury liner in October , 1996 , thus adding luster to the already famous names of the Queens and giving the Cunard Line a head start in business in the new era.
