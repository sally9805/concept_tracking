BEYOND THE GLASS MOUNTAIN A Story WALLACE STEGNER S OMEONE had left a funny paper in the booth , and while he waited with his ear intent on the regular buzzing rings , Mark let his eye follow the pictured squares . I know somebody that likes your new hat , Emmy , Kayo 's balloon said , and Emmy 's pleased balloon said , Well , for thirty-nine fifty they ought to , who is he ? and Kayo 's balloon said It 's Beefy McGuire , he 'd like it for his birdsnest collection , and on the fourth ring the line clicked and Mel 's inquiring voice said , " Hello ? " The voice was as familiar as yesterday , a voice whose wire-filtered flatness Mark had heard over telephones ten thousand times . The rising hairs prickled on the back of his neck ; he felt as he might have felt if a door had opened and the face of someone long dead had looked casually out . And he noted instantly , in refutation of his fears , that the voice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouthpiece . " Hello , you poop out , " he said . " This is Canby . " The old password came naturally , as if he were back seventeen years . In their college crowd everybody had called everybody else Canby , for no reason except that someone , probably Mel , had begun it and everyone else had followed suit . There had been a real Canby , a sort of goof . Now hewas a CPA in Denver , and the usurpers of his name were scattered from coast to coast . " Well , Canby ! " the filtered voice said heartily . " How 's the boy ? " There was a pause . Then Mel 's voice , more distorted now , beginning to be his clowning voice , said suspiciously , " What was that name again ? " " Canby , " Mark said . " Cornelius C. Canby . " He raised his head , grinning and waiting for the real recognition . " Cornelius C. Canby ? " Mel 's thickening , burbling voice said . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell of a note , " Mark said . " Your old friend Canby was here , and you did n't even get the name . " Mel 's voice was thick as glue now , like something mired down , except that on occasional syllables it fluttered upward like a mud-heavy bird . It was a maudlin , wandering , caressing voice , very convincing to strangers and drunks , and it always made any drunk his instant pal . " Canby ? " it said . " D' you say Canby ? Cornelius Canby ? Well my God . Wonnersnevercease . Canby , after all these years ! Come on over here and shake my hand . Where are you ? Hire a car . Wait a minute , I 'll come and get you myself . " " Do n't bother , " Mark said . " I can walk over in five minutes . " He grinned again e into the mouthpiece . " Are you at home or out at some bar ? " " Just down at the corner pub having little drink , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , home quick as you are . Not far away . " There was another pause . " What was z'name ? " Mark was beginning to feel a shade uncomfortable . The clowning was routine , but there was a point where it should have stopped . It left things uncertain . " You stinker , " he said , " this is Aker . Remember me ? " The drunken voice was an amazed buzz in the earpiece . Out of the buzz words formed . " You mean Belly Aker , the basketball player , erstwhile holder of the Big Ten scoring record ? " " The same . " " Not Mark Aker , the eminent peni-cillinologist ? " " It is he . " " Well my God , " Mel said . " I remember you . Seen your name in the Alumni Magazine . " The words degenerated into a buzz , then became articulate again . " You old spore-picker . How 's boy ? " Then in a moment the earphone bellowed , " What the hell you standing around there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm on my way . " H E HUNG up and stepped out of the booth self-consciously , looking around to see if anyone had been close enough to hear the nonsense he had been talking . As he walked through the drugstore and out into the street he found himself explaining as if to some critical stranger . Just to listen to Cottam , you 'd think he was a maudlin sot , but that 's just a manner he wears . He puts it on for the same reason some people put on dark glasses . . . He found himself at the corner of College and Dubuque Streets in Iowa City , at a little past ten on a Sunday morning in May , and as he stopped on the corner to let a car pass , the utter and passionate familiarity of everything smote him like a wind . Mel 's voice on the wire had prepared him for nostalgia . Now the past moved up on him in a wave ; it was as if he had never left here , or had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reassuring edge of reality again . The brick street ran warm and empty down across the powerhouse bridge and up the other side , curving under big elms and hickories . On the crown of the hill across the river the Quadrangle 's squat ivied towers barely topped the trees , and over on the other hill to the right the stone lace of the hospital tower rose above the massive rectangularity of the medical buildings . The lawns below Old Capitol were almost deserted , and the locusts were shrilling in the streetside trees . Odd compulsions moved him . He found himself reciting the names of all the main university buildings . Crossing the river , he ran his hand along the cool cement rail as if establishing a contact , and halfway across he looked back to see how the union and the reserve library strung out along the riverbank , and the footbridge arched across to the experimental theater . The banks of the river had been landscaped since his time , but otherwise he saw no change . The highway traffic west poured across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limestone bluffs . Mark looked curiously at the few students he met , wondering if they felt as he felt the charm and warmth that lay in the brick streets and the sleepy river and the sun-warmed brick and stone of the university . Probably no one appreciated things like that until they were gone and lost and irretrievable . On his left as he stepped off the bridge he saw the little eating shack where he and Mel had had long johns and coffee practically every morning for four years . The mere look of its outside , patched with coke signs and Baby Ruth signs and Chesterfield signs , filled his nostrils with the peculiar and unique odors of the place : coffee and smoke and slightly rancid fat , oily-sweet doughnuts and baked paint and the reek of the bug-spray they used on the cockroaches , and under all the watery , tarry , wet-mud smells of the river . The metal rasping of the seventeenyear-locusts rose loud as a crescendo in a symphonic poem as he climbed the hill , and it struck him as amusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly seventeen years . He could n't quite imagine where those years had gone ; it did not seem that either he or the town had changed a particle . The tennis courts he passed reflected hundreds of remembered mornings like this , and in the field house beyond them were whole lifetimes of recollection . He would have liked to go in under the big round roof just to soak himself in the sensations he remembered : smell of lockers opened on stale gymn clothes and stiff sweated socks ; steam and thumping radiators and liquid soap smell ; sweat and medicated foot baths and the chlorine smell and the jiggly reflecting chemical blue of the pool ; splat of naked feet on concrete , pink of bare flesh , lean bellies and tiptoe bunching calves , the bulging triceps of the gymnastics team working out on the horses . Most of all , the barnlike cold of the basketball floor , and the tiny brittle feeling of coming out before a game to warm up in front of that crowd-faced emptiness , and the clubbing roar of crowd-sound as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same roar whether you made it or missed it . All of it was still there  --  unimaginably varied smells and sounds and sights that together made up the way he had once lived , the thing he had once been , perhaps the thing he still was . He was in all of it , and Mel with him . It came to him like a pang that never since the days when he and Mel used to fool around after lunch in the Quad cafeteria , throwing rolled-up paper napkins at water tumblers , had he had a completely relaxed and comfortable ability to enjoy himself . They had made games out of everything ; whole Sunday mornings they had spent throwing curves with pot covers in Mel 's mother 's kitchen . In those Damon-and-Pythias days there had been a sharp and tingling sense of identity and one intense and constant comradeship , and those were the best days of his life . Passing the field house he passed himself and Mel as they had used to be , and the feeling that he had not merely lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the mild spring morning , as insistent as the skirring of the locusts . It was like sky-writing on the big warm sky . The light over the whole hill was pure , pale , of an exaggerated clarity , as if all the good days of his youth had been distilled down into this one day , and the whole coltish ascendant time when he was eighteen , nineteen , twenty , had been handed back to him briefly , intact and precious . That was the time when there had been more hours in the day , and every hour precious enough so that it could be fooled away . By the time a man got into the high thirties the hours became more frantic and less precious , more needed and more carefully hoarded and more fully used , but less loved and less enjoyed . T f IEN he was pushing the doorbell button , bracing himself obscurely for something  --  for joy ? for recognition ? for a renewed flood of this potent and unexpected nostalgia ? ? and the door opened . Mel stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual , still deceptively round-armed and round-faced , with his beaked nose and his tender child 's mouth . He was either drunk or playing drunk . He smirked , and his eyes blinked in owlish amazement . " Let me shake your hand ! " he said , and hauled Mark inside . Tamsen got up off the couch where she had been sitting with a highball in her hand . As she came forward . smiling , transferring the glass to her Left hand , Mark noted how she adjusted her face for greeting . She was probably prettier than she had ever been , her hair in a long bob with sun-bleached streaks in it , her face smoothly tanned , her eyes candid , her smile white and frank . Presumably the two of them had been drinking together , but where Mel was frowsy and blinking , with red-streaked eyeballs , she was smooth and sober and impeccable . " Of all the unexpected people ! " she said , and gave him a firm hand . She left him in no doubt who was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NIel 's hand pulled him around . " Canby , you old snake in the grass , where you been ? I 've tried to call you up every night for ten years . " " You did , " Mark said . " Twice . Once in New Haven and once in New York . Both times at two in the morning . " Tamsen laughed . " Old Melly , " she hipaompall Naomi said , almost as if affectionately . " Every time he gets tight he wants to call somebody up . The further away they are , the more he wants to call . " Mel was standing spraddling , a little flickering smile on his mouth . One hand was on Mark 's shoulder . With the other he captured Mark 's right hand again and shook it slowly . His breath was heavy with whiskey , and Mark felt dismayed and half sick , He had been so sure at first that the thickening voice had been put on as part of the old clowning act . Now he was bothered precisely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he laughed at the ponderous solemnity , the incoherent , bumbling , repetitive nonsense , the marvellously accurate imitation of a soggy drunk , Mark backed away , because he could n't be quite sure that the act was conscious any more . The act had become the man , and he went around living and acting out a grotesque parody of himself ; or if it had n't become the man , then it had been put on defensively so much that communication was no longer possible . Nothing had come of those telephone calls except a mumble of doubletalk and affectionate profanity , and yet Mark felt that there had been in each instance a need , a loneliness , a reaching out . He felt that there was the same thing now , if Mel would let it show . The old comradeship was there ; this drunken parody was embarrassment as much as anything , the defense of a thin-skinned organism . " Been peeking down those microscopes , " Mel said solemnly , pumping Mark 's hand . " You biological old pot licker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest man , " Mark said . " Two or three other people helped . " He got his hand free , and as his eyes crossed Mel 's there was almost communication between them , a flash of perfectly sober understanding and warmth . Mel 's delicate , bruised-looking lips pursed , but then the look slipped and was gone , and he was pawing for Mark 's hand again , saying , " Canby , you old Rhodes Scholar , slip me the grip . " Tamsen was amused . " You should charge him . Remember when he paid a barfly a dollar an hour to shake his hand down at Frank 's ? ! " Kept me poor , " Mel said , with a sweet imbecilic grin . " Lose all your friends , got to buy more . " He smiled into Mark 's face , hanging to hand and shoulder , and Mark looked deep behind that idiot alcoholic smile trying to compel expression of what he knew was there : the recognition and the pain . Mel beamed at him . Tamsen too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't get over how much you 've changed , " she said . " You used to be such a string bean . " " Cheer up , " Mark said . " I 'm still a string bean at heart . " " No fooling , " Mel said . He plucked the cloth of Mark 's sleeve , sniffed his Angers . " Where 'd you get that jacket ? " " Montreal , " Mark said , and immediately felt an obscure guilty shame , as if he had been betrayed into boasting , rubbing in the fact that he had gone up and out in the world and Mel had been marooned behind . " I was up there a couple weeks ago at a genetics conference , " he said lamely , in extenuation . For an instant he was furious at Mel , so furious he shook . In college it had been Mel who had everything -- money enough , and clothes , and a car , and a home where starveling students could come like grateful sidling dogs off the street . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his home was full of music and books and a certain sense of social grace and personal responsibility . Mel had taught the whole unlicked lot of them something , how to win and how to lose , how to live with people and like them and forgive them . He had never owned a dime 's worth of anything that he was n't glad to share . Now the shoe was on the other foot . Now Mark had gone higher and farther than any of them had ever aimed , and it embarrassed and enraged him to know that he could give lessons to Mel . And it was unjust that having shared everything for four years in college , they could n't share this trouble that Mel was in now . T AMSEN 'S level blue eyes were inspecting him , and it struck him that here at least was something they had never shared . He had always known more about Tamsen than Mel had . When he stood up as Mel 's best man he could have told the bridegroom the names of four people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had ; he had wished it a hundred times . And catching Tamsen 's eyes , twinkling with a little spark of malice , he knew she understood precisely what he was thinking . She had always been shrewd , and she had been all her life one of the world 's most accomplished and convincing liars . When she went after Mel she had fooled even the people who knew her best , made them believe she was infatuated . . . . " I tell you for sure , " she said , " if you 'd been as good looking then as you are now I 'd never have let old Melly take me in to church . " " Maybe there 's still time , " Mark said . Mel 's tugging hand hauled him around . " You 've changed , you know that , you damn Yale professor ? " " So have you , " Mark said , but his attempt to hold Mel 's eye was unsuccessful , and he added , " I stay in nights , now . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That 's fact , " Mel said . " Terrible influence . Half stiff ten thirty Sunday morning . Blame that boy of mine . Got his old man out playing baseball with a hangover before breakfast . You ever meet that boy ? " " Never did . " " Where is he , Tam ? " " He 's around , " Tamsen said . " How about me getting you two a drink ? " Mark let her go . It was a way of getting Mel alone . It seemed to him that some of the drunken pose fell away from Mel as soon as his wife left the room . He looked into the streaked eyes and shook his head and grinned . " How are things going , anyway ? " The eyes were round and innocent . " Things going wonderful . I run the business now , since my dad died . My dad was a good business man , you know that , Canby ? " " I know that , " Mark said . " It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate that he might have only two minutes more before Tamsen returned , he opened his mouth to say what he had come to say , and found that his tongue would n't go around it . In that instant it was clear that you did not come in on an old friend and say , " I hear your wife 's been playing around with a golf pro . I could have warned you about her that way . Probably I should have . But I hear you found out all right , and were all set to get a divorce . Bailey told me that much , a year ago . Then I heard that instead of getting a divorce you went down to St. Louis , you and Tamsen and the boy , and stayed six months , and came back home and no more said about any divorce . Get rid of her . She 'll cheat on you all her life , and break you in the process . If she 's pulled some lie out of the bag and convinced you that you were mistaken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of hell . For the love of God , get that divorce , for the sake of the boy and for your own sake . She 'll suck you dry like an old orange skin . You 're already so far gone I could cry  --  soggy with alcohol and with that comedy-routine front on all the time . Come and stay with me , I 'll line you up with Alcoholics Anonymous if you want . Give me a chance to pay some of what I owe you , " y ou simply did not say things like that . Even thinking about them made them sound self-righteous and prying . Instead , you looked uneasily at your oldest and closest friend , trying to surprise in his eyes the things you knew were there , pain and shame and bitterness and defeat . But there was too thick an insulating layer between . Seventeen years were too many . Mel was like the elk in Jim . Bridger 's Yellowstone story . He grazed on the other side of the glass mountain , clear and undistorted , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went off , and the elk did n't even raise his head , did n't even hear the report . He just went on grazing , with blankness like a membrane over his eyeballs and an unpierceable transparent wall between him and the world . Mel 's lips twitched . He lurched forward , looking puzzled and solicitous . " Whazza name ? " he said , besotted and polite , and turned his car sideward like a deaf man . Mark pushed him away angrily just as Tamsen came in with glasses . Mel took two and handed one to Mark with a crooked grin . " Here , rinse your mouth , " he said . Tamsen raised her glass . " Here 's to the local boy who made good . " They clicked glasses elaborately all around . Irritated . baffled , frustrated , gnawed by that odd obscure shame , Mark drank with them to himself . I wAs thinking about you the other day , " Tamsen was saying . " We were down watching the spring canoe race and two kids went over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mel did once . " " I hope they did n't swallow as much water as I did , " Mark said . " Yeah , but this the other day was an accident , " Mel said . " You , you pot-licker , you put us over there just to duck me . " " I was along , " Mark said . " I went over too . Remember ? " Tamsen shook her head . " You were a pair , " she said . " I guess I 'd forgotten what a pair you were . " They sat nursing their drinks , the door open upon the street and the locust noise , and groped carefully backward for the things to remember and laugh about , gleaning the safe nostalgic past . But it was not the canoes over waterfalls , the times Jay Straup tried to climb Old Capitol steps in his old Model T , the picnics on Signal Hill when all the farmer kids used to creep up and spy on the college kids necking , that Mark wanted to remember . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them bored him . He kept looking at Mel in search of that spark of understanding , and he kept wanting to say Remember the times we used to go out on dates and come in late in your old Ford , and stop down along one of the river joints for a pork tenderloin and a ginger beer , two or three o'clock in the morning , only a truck driver or two on the stools ? How good sandwiches tasted at that hour , and how late the moon would be over the bluffs when we came out yawning and started up to your house ? Remember the mornings we woke up in this house , this very house seventeen or eighteen or twenty years ago , and found the sun scrambled in the bedclothes , and had a shower and breakfast and went out onto the sidewalk , not for anything especially , but just to be outdoors , and walked under those treesout there up to the corner and back again , loafing , alive to the fingertips , talking about anything , nothing , girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did , but what we were , that I remember , and I know that what we were is still here , if we 'd peel off the defenses and the gag-lines and the double-talk routines and the Montreal jackets . The porch thudded with feet and a chubby boy of twelve came in with a bat in his hand . He stood forward gravely when Mel introduced him , shook hands with polite indifference , coasted into the kitchen and came back gnawing on a cookie . " Canby , my friend , " Me ! said to him , " you 'll be as fat as your old man . " The child was a curious blend of his parents , with Tamsen 's deceptively clear eyes and Mel 's twisting delicate mouth . He looked at his father over the cookie , grinning . " Stay away from pappy , " Tamsen said . " Pappy started out to cure a hangover and behold he 's swizzled again . " A grunt that sounded almost like an angry outburst escaped Mel . He lunged for the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy eluded him . " Come here and I 'll knock your two heads together . " Still grinning , the boy banged out onto the porch . " How about another drink for the two old grads ? " Tamsen said . " Why not ? " Mel said , but Mark rose . " I 've got to catch a train at twelve thirty . " " You do n't have to go , " Mel said . " You just came , Canby . " Mark put out his hand to Tamsen . " Goodbye , " he said . " If you ever come east do n't forget me . " He was trying to decide whether the look in her clear eyes had been triumphant , or whether there had actually been any look at all , as he and Mel went out the sidewalk and down to the corner . They did not speak on the way down , but on the corner , under the warm shade , their voices almost lost in the incessant shrilling of the locusts , they snook hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say any of what it had been in his mind to say . But even so he gripped Mel 's hand and held his eyes : " I wish you the best , you burn , " he said , and his throat tightened up as it sometimes tightened at an emotional crisis in a play . " If you 're not so stiff you ca n't listen straight , listen to this . I wish you the best , and if there 's ever a time I can . . . " He stopped . Mel was looking at him without any of the sodden fuzziness that had marked him for the past hour . His eyes were pained , intent , sad . On his delicate bruised lips there was a flicker of derision . The Russians and Ourselves I DO not believe that we can understand the Russians : I believe that we can strive not to misunderstand them . I do not now believe ( if I ever believed ) that we can induce them to appreciate ( still less to share ) our liberal point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are clear , and firm , and consistent , and united , we can lead them to realize that there are certain rights and principles on which we shall make a stand . I do not believe that war is either inevitable or even probable : but I do believe that the liberal powers , while being fair and generous to Russia and her associates , must maintain united vigilance and strength . I certainly do not believe that any arguments can shake the rigid Russian faith in their own dogma : but I do believe that , if we are very wise , we can in practice show the world that the Marxist dialectic is not scientific , that capitalism can in fact avoid the dread cycle of boom and slump and war , and that the liberal world can offer a way of life which is infinitely more humane and agreeable , while no less certain , than the way of life which Communism preaches . And above all I believe ( as I have always believed ) in the impossibility of finding any single or sudden solution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no special course of treatment , which can cure these ills ; all we can hope to do is to render our own bodies sufficiently healthy to resist these maladies . No sane man would predict what will have happened to the world in ten years from now . Things may be better , and they may be worse . All we can do at present is to preserve our common principles , to follow the immediate course with vigilance and caution , to avoid the twin pitfalls of provocation and weakness , and to make quite certain that if disaster comes we shall not have to reproach ourselves , or each other , with lack of patience or intelligence . I believe that by so walking , we shall walk in safety . .. . ? Harold Nicolson , writing about the Paris Conference of 1946 in Foreign Affairs , January 1947
