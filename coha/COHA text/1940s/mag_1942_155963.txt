At one concert , a friendly stagehand advised the great Anton Rubinstein not to go on without blacking his face for the " show . " <P> At another , a seven-piece orchestra attempted Beethoven 's Eroica . <P> At another , the orchestra played The Fireman 's Quadrille , during which a fire alarm clanged , men in helmets dragged in hoses , doused real water on fake blaze . Such was unmusical America of the 19th Century , as portrayed by David Ewen in Music Comes to America ( Thomas Y. Crowell ; $3 ) . Picturing a young nation 's groping progress toward musical maturity , the story is by turns comic , valiant , humiliating , prideful . No scholarly treatise , not even an error-free* record , the book is none the less an engrossing , vivid history ( as Mark Sullivan might tell it ) of music 's impact on the U.S. people . <P> Audiences of the early days nocked to hear the Polish pianist Volovsky " play 400 notes in one measure " ; to watch jullien , famed French-English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves from a gold platter and carefully draw them on his fingers before conducting Beethoven ; to hear &; see 100 red-shirted firemen at the Boston Peace Jubilee of 1869 clanking 100 anvils to Verdi 's Anvil Chorus . <P> In the early Victrola era , a prized record was the $7 single-sided Sextet from Lucia , sung by Caruso , Tetrazzini , Jacoby , Amato , Journet , Bada . In the hysterical years of World War I , secret service men shadowed non-Germans Leopold Stokowski , Ossip Gabrilowitsch , Leopold Godowsky . The conductor-worshiping ' 205 showed the most extreme faddism ( " Toscanini conducting Italian nonsense could pack the hall " ) . In the late-lamented Flagstad epoch , Tristan &; Isolde grossed $150,000 in nine performances , " thereby becoming the greatest ' hit ' ever to strike Broadway . " <P> Author Ewen hopefully pictures the present-day U.S. as a singing , playing , listening , understanding nation of 10,000,000 music students , 50,000 school bands and orchestras , though he tempers this estimate with such revealing anecdotes as Samuel Goldwyn 's Hollywood-scented remark to Jascha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can make you famous ! " More typical of today , Author Ewen thinks , is Jose Iturbi 's story of how he found the radio of a roadside lunch-wagon tuned to a Sunday evening symphony . The clatter melted into silence as customers , dishwashers , waitresses succumbed to the music 's spell . But the counterman was n't satisfied . " He scowled at four hamburgers sizzling on the griddle and carefully removed them one by one . ' ' <P> <P> *E.g. , the statement that Frank Black succeeded Walter Damrosch as XBC 's musical director in 1928 ; actually , he succeeded Erno Rapee , in 1932 . Damrosch appointed musical counsel in 1927 , still retains the title .
