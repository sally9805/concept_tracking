txt Jobless for Air Wardens In view of the fact that it looks now as though several million men will be temporarily out of positions in order to make way for the all-out defense program and that there is a plan to pay them $24 a week until they have fitted themselves for the new jobs , would n't it be a good idea to have these men trained to replace the present air raid wardens . Since there will be so much man power available , the working time could easily be divided . Voluntary labor is always a difficult problem to handle  --  this would give the country a group of men who would be of great value in an emergency , in addition to earning their government $24 and remove from it the demoralizing effect of dole . FRANCES ROCKEFELLER KING . New York , Jan. 31 , 1942.
