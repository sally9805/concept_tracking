In the Philippines the Japanese , with the initiative still in their chubby hands , appeared to be starting their big push this week . Off Lingayen Gulf , 120 miles northwest of Manila , the U.S. forces reported sighting a flotilla of 80 enemy transports , announced that the major drive had begun . General Douglas MacArthur had long anticipated a heavy attack at Lingayen . An earlier thrust , in which the Japanese tried to put down troops from 154 motorboats , had been beaten off by a Philippine division which did not let a single Jap soldier reach shore alive . But more attempts were bound to come . <P> Therefore canny Douglas MacArthur had committed only a small part of his force to battle on the big island of Luzon . The battles at Legaspi , Aparri and Vigan , where the Japanese had set up beachheads , had been predominantly Air Force shows . The Japanese had grabbed these beachheads apparently to set up airdromes , and they had succeeded , though with heavy losses to men , transports and naval support . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Manila . <P> Meanwhile the Japanese opened up a new sector last week , swinging far to the south in an enveloping action . Off Davao , 600 miles south of Manila on the Moro-inhabited island of Mindanao , the enemy appeared one day with four transports , naval and air support . <P> Davao had no defenses to compare with those on Luzon . Strategists have long recognized that in a pinch Mindanao might have to be abandoned to the Jap-who would still be far from his objective , with no solid land bridge to the north . Davao 's defenders were a comparatively small force headed by a 51-year-old Texan , Lieut . Colonel Roger Hilsman . <P> For his defense Colonel Hilsman had more problems than a small force , a long supply line and the size of his opponent ( who probably came from the Japanese base at Palau in the Mandated Islands 600 miles east of Davao ) . Colonel Hilsman 's worst problem was likely to be the Japanese population of Davao , estimated as high as 25,000 , composed predominantly of men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmistakable marks of military training . <P> Colonel Hilsman 's first act when the war began was to throw 1,500 Japanese into the clink . When the Japs struck at Davao , first by an aerial assault and then by landing party , the news from Mindanao thinned out . All Manila could say was that " fighting continues . " The Japanese were not fighting a silly , diffused battle for the Philippines . They were playing heavily on the assumption that they could wear down Philippine supply-especially of planes and ammunition-and strike hard before more could come from the mainland . In snatching Davao they were also going after a base , 1,600 miles from Singapore , that could be another link in a chain around the Philippines , through the Mandated Islands , from Tokyo to Singapore . If the Japanese could grab it , while they also set themselves up in North Borneo , they would have a fairly well-protected detour around the submarine-guarded narrows in the South China Sea .                 @ @ @ @
