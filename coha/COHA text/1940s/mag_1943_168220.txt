In the Tennessee maneuvers last week a full U.S. airborne division was used in a tactical operation with larger units . Paratroops and glider-borne infantry carried out the attack . Riding with the glidermen was TIME Correspondent John H. Walker , who wrote this account . <P> The airborne attack was launched from Campbell Field , Ky. , 100 miles northwest of the battlefield . In the grey mist big transports thundered down the runways closely spaced , each plane crammed with paratroops and each towing a bulky Army glider . <P> Now it was time for us to get moving . Major General William Carey Lee , division commander , who had invited me to ride with him , led the way to Glider 37 , whispering mildly : " Well , here we go again . " We piled in . <P> The tow plane started up before we were sitting down . A young lieutenant , settled on the benches running fore &; aft on both sides of the glider , checking parachutes , barely got out in time . He lit running as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature , lifted off the runway . To a glider novice the take-off was startling ; we were airborne and climbing on the rope while the heavier tow plane was still soaring down the runway , picking up speed for its own takeoff . We climbed rapidly to 700 feet , circled to get into formation . <P> Candid Craft . The troop-carrying glider is a candid sort of aircraft , no secrets , nothing concealed . Canvas fabric covers the fuselage ; in flight it vibrates like a drumhead . The whole craft is springy and alive as a new buggy . Pilot and copilot sit up in the blunt , transparent nose , a single row of instrument dials in front of them . The noise of rushing air is astonishing . <P> Controlling the flying boxcar on the end of the tow cable is not easy . Our pilot worked hard at it , carefully keeping us above the tow plane and out of its jolting prop-wash . He gripped the control wheel tightly , several times took one hand off to stretch his cramped fingers . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undercarriage release gear jammed . Combat gliders use wheels only for the takeoff , then drop them and land on heavy skids . Failure of our release gear meant that we would have to land on wheels-and no brakes . At the time it seemed unimportant . <P> At 6:55 a.m. we were less than five minutes from our target- " Z-field , " a meadow near Lafayette , Tenn. , where the divisional command post was to be established . Ground mists had kept us fairly high . Ahead and below we could see other tow planes flitting along . Now gliders were cutting loose , swinging off to land in the little tree-bordered fields ahead . <P> Glider Crackup . Suddenly our pilot reached up , hesitated a fraction of a second , then smacked the tow release lever . With a twang like a snapped harp string , the long white towing cable vanished . The pounding thunder of air dropped to a murmur . <P> At once the glider slowed down , then picked up speed again as the pilot banked sharply , stood it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were three possible fields in sight , but we were too high and going too fast for the nearest one . The farthest was too tiny , surrounded by big , mean-looking trees , and we would have to poop over a highway and power lines to get in.
