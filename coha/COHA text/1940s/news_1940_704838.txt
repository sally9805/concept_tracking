txt Our Stand in East Reviewed Facing All the Facts of Our Situation In Regard to Japan Suggested To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your correspondent , Nathan April , urges us to face the facts in deciding an Oriental policy . That seems to be excellent advice , but is n't it barely possible that he has n't faced all of them ? One is that we have a Navy that is much bigger and much better than Japan 's . Another is that there is still such a thing as the Pacific Ocean and that it makes a question of our comparative strength in Asia primarily a naval question and not a question of the size of our standing Army . Of possibly even more importance is the fact that Japan is dependent upon us for the war materials to build and supply the military might that has so alarmed Mr. April . Let 's face that fact , too . Your correspondent says , " We can sincerely deplore the ravishment of China . " That is true , and we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have done so . He states that " we may not like " the fact that Japan " is carrying on a war of bloody conquest . " Do we like the fact that American scrap iron , American oil , and American copper have made that conquest possible ? Even the Japanese admit that their dependence upon the United States for war materials at the present time is so great that any stoppage of those materials would be a paralyzing blow . So long as we have that strength it might be well to face the fact that we are not so helpless in the Pacific as your correspondent would have us believe . By all means , let 's face the facts , but let 's face all of them . Let 's face , among others , the fact that we have created , and are still sustaining , the very military might of which Mr. April is so afraid . Let 's also face the fact that we have the means to check that might by cutting off three-fourths of its supplies whenever our consciences get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject let 's face the facts about the gratuitous advice offered in the dispatch of K. K. Kawakami , offered to the statesmen of Britain and France , who , in his words , have " shown a singular lack of vision . " This Japanese correspondent in THE TIMES this morning suggests that all that is necessary to preserve peace in Asia is for the Western powers to return their concessions to China . That , he states , is the real objective in the latest Japanese grabs . The fact that is missing is Mr. Kawakami 's definition of China . Does he , by any chance , mean that Japan would be satisfied if the Western Powers returned their concessions to the legitimately recognized government at Chungking , headed by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ? It is safe to say that he does not . In other words , the way to keep Japan from taking the rest of Eastern Asia is to give it to the Japanese definition of " China , " the puppet government at Nanking , installed by Japan . This sounds suspiciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance . Let 's face these facts about the Orient by all means . But let 's get all of them before we decide to run away , and let 's state all of them before we counsel short-sighted statesmen to surrender to Japan . PAULINE SMITH . New York , July 4. 1940 . A Chinese Viewpoint To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Tams : It is strange that in this country , where Chamberlain 's appeasement policy has been severely criticized , there should be talk of bribing Japan , an aggressor as dangerous as Germany . Japan has not yet joined the Axis , not because she is unwilling , but because she is unable . With more than a million of her soldiers on Chinese soil , with a large part of her merchant marine engaged in transporting supplies to her army in China and her fleet in blockading the Chinese coast , she can not stand another major military conflict . Hitler would long ago have had an active and powerful ally in the Far East if we Chinese had been weak-kneed , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German mediation . History has shown us the impossibility of reconciling these insatiable marauders . Japan is no child ; she can not be bought over with a little piece of candy . What if , after having brought her adventures in China to a successful close , she should turn to India , Australia and the South Sea Islands , and , cooperating with Germany and Italy , attack the Western Hemisphere from the Pacific ? She would then be much stronger . What at that time could Britain and the United States do ? In the past three years we have lost millions of valiant soldiers . We have suffered more losses and indignities than any other people . We shall still fight on , despite overwhelming odds , because we know that we have been fighting for democracy and freedom . We hope earnestly that this country will maintain a far-sighted and intelligent policy in the Far East . We appeal not only to your sense of responsibility or your humanitarian motives ; we plead our case chiefly as your fellow-warriors under the same banner  --  the banner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , V. Y.

Stimson , who advises this country to help Great Britain win its contest with Hitler , lest we find ourselves fighting his forces on our own shores . It possibly is too much to hope that our people will wake up to the immediacy of our own situation , and demand of their representatives in Congress the twenty-four-hour-a-day production of the necessary ships , planes and munitions for Britain who now holds the bag for us . Will the fortunate citizens of this country ever realize that they can not hope for continued liberty unless they take upon themselves the responsibility of maintaining it ? Mr. Stimson , who speaks with authority and knowledge , has shown us the road to safety without war . Will we take it ? I wonder , ELDER CITIZEN . New York , July 3. 1940 . Planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naval Vessels To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORE TIMIES : Your editorial " Ships and Planes ' opens up a subject which ought to be studied by every officer of our Navy and Army and by all those who have authority with respect to our national defense , including at least those members of the Congress who share responsibility for our foreign relations . The contrast drawn in your editorial between our latest battleship , of which the keel has just been laid , and our " flying fortress " planes now in production deserves repeating and amplifying : Forty-five thousand - ton battleships cost $100,000,000 ; time required to complete four years . " Flying fortresses " cost $250,000 ; now in production . We can speed up the production of " flying fortresses " and thus add quickly to our strength for either attack or defense ; but a battleship until its completion in 1944 or later is a liability which may be destroyed at any time by some enemy bomber . Naval authorities , not only here but elsewhere , do not appear to have realized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art of war . The battleship is a huge floating fortress , which is menaced today not only by battleships of the enemy but by torpedoes which may be launched from hidden submarines as well as from surface craft , which are far more mobile than a heavily armored battleship . Then there are mines of various sorts , and a fleet of special vessels is required to sow these devilish instruments of destruction , and later to sweep them from the seas . Then there are all the varieties of bombing planes whose object is the detruction of naval vessels of all sorts from battleships down . It has recently been declared that a heavy cruiser or battleship must be safeguarded by an " umbrella " of pursuit or other planes if it is to keep afloat . Some years ago , when the British fleet was at Alexandria and tension was high between Britain and Italy , the threat was made that one or more Italian aviators had been assigned to each British ship , and on signal each plane would plunge with its load of high explosives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no defense for any naval vessel against such attacks . There are other reasons why the country needs a review of the plans for our national defense by high authorities . The question of battleship versus cruiser or , to put it another way , of heavy armor versus speed , was fought out when the pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee was defeated in a battle with three British cruisers of considerably lighter armor and armament . Our naval authorities must not fail to profit from this and other lessons of the present war . The question of planes versus battleships involves the question of bases . The cost of a naval base such as we have at Pearl Harbor , with its drydocks , shops , stores , etc. , is terrific even in peace conditions , and under present conditions the cost goes soaring . The cost of a base for naval planes is trifling in comparison , and the planes can cover a far larger area and enable us to strike heavy blows at an enemy while he is still far removed from our shores . The engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dollar earn the most interest . Those engineers who are forging the weapons to protect our nation must seek to make the billions of dollars which are poured out for their use produce the greatest results in national defense and in the shortest time . The United States has great advantages over its enemies in its control of raw materials necessary for warfare , and in the ability to harness power and machines with science and skill . But we must be sure we are building the right weapons . CHARLES WHITING BAKER . Montclair , N. J. , July 3 , 1940 . Discrimination Seen To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TH , TES : The TIMES printed an item concerning Philip Stegerer , an American citizen who fought in the Canadian Air Force and who has consequently been refused readmission to this country . The fact that such a thing can happen to a native American indicates that our immigration laws are vitally in need of revision . How can we reconcile such treatment of a native-born citizen with the fact that thousands of German-Americans were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return after voting in the Saar plebiscite ? MORRIS S.
