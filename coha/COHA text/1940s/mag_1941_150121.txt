Most pompously egotistical work in all symphonic music is Richard Strauss 's Ein Heldenleben ( A Hero 's Life ) . It not only brassily depicts its hero besting his detractors , but , by quoting snatches from Don Juan , Don Quixote , Death and Transfiguration , etc. , announces that the hero is Herr Strauss himself . On sale last fortnight in Manhattan shops was a new recording of Ein Heldenleben , by Artur Rodzinski and the Cleveland Orchestra ( Columbia : 10 sides ; $5.50 ) . It was well recorded but not the best ever ( most sweeping performance is Victor 's 1928 version , by Willem Mengelberg ) . What made news about Rodzinski 's Heldenleben was the program leaflet which did not accompany the records-because it was suppressed . Said the leaflet , written by Musico Nicolas Slonimsky : <P> " Ein Heldenleben is Hitler 's favorite work . It depicts the life of a Hero grievously misunderstood by his fellow men and his fellow enemies . The Hero is essentially a peace maker but , thanks to the intrigues of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He confounds his enemies on the battle field , and is then free to build a new order in which peace is the only supreme law , after every conscious and unconscious foe has been crushed into the dust . . . . " <P> When customers complained about this " propaganda , " Columbia gathered in every last copy of it . Musico Slonimsky said-believably , since he is a Russian Jew who has been in the U. S. for 18 years-that he was just joking . <P> Other records of the month :
