Right at the start of their trip to Russia last October , the eleven-man C.I.O. delegation , headed by Secretary-Treasurer Jim Carey , failed to see things eye to eye . En route , in an unheated Paris hotel , one of the delegation 's passionate Russophiles griped about the cold water for shaving . In Moscow 's National Hotel , the same man thought any complaint about the cold water was Trotskyite sabotage . <P> Amid factory visits , ballet performances and vodka toasts , Chairman Carey 's delegates twittered and taunted each other as stormily as Mother Carey 's Chickens . Their visit to Russia lasted eight days . But it took 150 days for them to agree on the report that was finally published last week . <P> The delegation had a few , hard reservations-they were not impressed by Soviet mass production technology , they found the Soviet standard of living low , by U.S. standards . They said : " The shortage of most consumers . . . makes a worker less concerned with . . . his wages than with . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly they were " impressed " and sympathetic over Soviet workers ' wartime heroism , postwar plans for reconstruction , monolithic trade union organization , and cradle-to-grave social security . <P> <P> At a mass meeting of trade unionists in Leningrad , the CIOers made enthusiastic speeches , topped by the passionate cry of Russia-loving Reid Robinson ( Mine , Mill &; Smelter Workers ) : " We must break down the propaganda that you have no democracy as we have ! " <P> Nowhere in the final report was there any echo of the feeling voiced by British trade unionists , who also paid a visit to Russia last year . Said the Britons ( in a report by their Iron &; Steel Trades Confederation ) : " The functions and activities of the trade union may differ . . . in a Socialist and a Capitalist state , but never , in our view , to the point . . . accepted in the Soviet trade unions-that the workers ' principal interests can safely be left to a workers ' government . . . at all times . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and particularly governments , has not yet reached that dizzy height .
