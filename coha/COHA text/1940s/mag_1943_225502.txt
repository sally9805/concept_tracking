The moral of the old nursery rhyme about Mother Hubbard has been jingle-jangle-jingling the cash registers of the nation 's department stores . Three weeks ago they did a whopping 21% more business than in the corresponding week of 1942 . Last fortnight ( week ending May 29 ) they did a super-whopping 42% more business than in the similar 1942 week . In New York City 's specialty shops ( mostly clothing ) the increase was 62% . <P> Buying of such volume means the U.S. public must soon reckon with one of the facts of war-empty store shelves .
