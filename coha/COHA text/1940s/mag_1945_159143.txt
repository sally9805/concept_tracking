Dutch Treat . The U.S. wartime policy of allocating surplus air transports to foreign airlines paid a fat dividend . The Royal Dutch Airlines ( K.L.M. ) bought 16 surplus transports and The Netherlands Government granted U.S. airlines cabotage ( the right to land and embark cargo and passengers en route to any destination in the world served by American flag lines in Holland ) . Thus the Dutch subscribed to the " Five Freedoms " drafted ( but not adopted by all the countries ) last year at the Chicago International Civil Aviation Conference ( TIME , Dec. 11 ) . Result : American Airlines Overseas , Inc. , formerly American Export Airlines , certified to fly to Amsterdam , may begin a survey flight next week . <P> How 's Fishing ? In one night fishermen from Monterey 's Cannery Row excitedly seined more sardines ( 9,000 tons ) than ever before . Captain Nick Mezin 's stubby Delores M. brought in the largest catch-260 tons . For the night 's work the 800-odd fishermen collected close to $200,000 . <P> The Public Be Damned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Department of Agriculture last week lifted the parity price for raw cotton to a new high of 21.58 a Ib. - the dizziest peak since 1920 . The Department was forced to boost the price under the Bankhead Amendment , which requires adjustment of the parity price . Uultimately ( and at pyramided price increases ) this sop to cotton growers ' inefficiency will be passed on to the consumer . <P> Growing Pains . Victor Emanuel , shrewd , farsighted chairman of the $36 million Aviation Corp . that owns 29.6% of Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corp. , continued his flight towards diversification . Having purchased Crosley Corp . ( TIME , July 2 ) in June ( radios , household appliances ) , Emanuel last week announced that Aviation Corp . will plunk out over $4,100,000 to buy control of New Idea , Inc. , manufacturers of farm machinery and implements .
