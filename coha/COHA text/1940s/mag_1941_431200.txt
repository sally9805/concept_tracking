 | America 's Where-to-Eat Expert Condensed from Scribner 's Commentator Frank J. Taylor FAMOUS CHEF told me that Duncan Hines has done d more in four years to lift the standard of the American cuisine than all the cooks had done in the previous 40 . Legions of vacationers , when they take to the highways this summer , will travel by the book ? a red paper-bound book called Adventures in Good Eating or a blue one , Lodging for the Night . The volumes are the hobby and business of a stocky , graying , slightly grumpy citizen of Bowling Green , Kentucky , who till recently was merely a successful Chicago traveling salesman . His word is gospel on where and what to eat in the U.S.A. Hines is amazed that a hobby has waxed so large . A dozen years ago in the course of his business travels , which covered every state , he and his wife began jotting down impressions of eating places in which they enjoyed exceptional food . Some of the best dishes , they noted , were served in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the best food in town served on oilcloth-covered tables upstairs above the wholesale produce market . So Hines jotted down : Boston , Mass . Durgin-Park , 30 North Market . Open all year except Sundays and holidays . The founder , John G. Chandler , on the job for over 65 years , is still going strong at 92 . Situated across from old Fancuil Hall , countless famous personages have crossed its historic threshold . You , too , can enjoy New England fare of excellent quality in an atmosphere teeming with old and interesting associations . L. , 5o ? to 65 ? . D. , 65 ? to $i.o5 . Hines and his wife swapped experiences in good eating with other motorists . They became habitual explorers , thought nothing of a S00-mile week-end trip to try out a new eating place , hotel or motor court . Business acquaintances formed the habit of calling Hines up , when leaving on a trip , to ask for a list of eating and sleeping places . He always obliged , adding , " Give me a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . " Before I realized it , I was spending more time on travel tips than on my business , " Hines laughs . Six years ago he published his roll of 700 tested eating places  | in a folder which he sent as a Christmas remembrance to every person who had asked him for advice . Swamped by requests for additional copies , Hines republished his lists in a pocket-size book , Adventures in Good Eating . A year later , he listed 3000 hotels , auto courts and tourist homes tested by himself or his friends in a companion volume , Lodging for the Night . Written from the traveler 's point of view , his comments jotted down on the spot without effort at literary style , they exuded the author 's sincerity . Still thinking of his books as a sideline , Hines sold them for $1.50 per copy , hoping to defray expenses . The first year he lost $1500 , the second year $600 . Then , as motorists told other motorists , sales doubled and redoubled , until he was putting out new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 450,000 books , which ranks them among best sellers . More astonishing yet was his mail , as many as 400 letters a day . People he had never seen poured out their adventures , suggesting new eating and lodging places , sometimes quarreling with his judgment on those already mentioned . Some of this quarreling is not really Hines ' fault . Some places dropped from later editions of Hines ' books still use his " approved " signs . And some he has never mentioned fraudulently advertise themselves as recommended by him . Many letters came from busy and important people , offering to help him check eating and lodging places . Hines accepted all offers at first , but now has sifted the list down to 6o discriminating gourmets . These volunteers include Lawrence Tibbett , Gluyas Williams , Mary Margaret McBride , Carveth Wells , bank presidents , professors , corporation executives . Without these assiduous volunteers , says Hines , the books would be out of the question . Last year Hines , now retired from his traveling-salesman job , built a low , white colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several girls handle the business . An additional source of revenue is selling Kentucky hickory-smoked hams , which he personally selects at the packing plants , cures and hangs in the pungent storeroom back of his house . Fully half of each year he and Mrs. Hines are on the road . When he registers at a hotel or tourist court , he signs an assumed name so that he will not be identified . His books contain a photograph of himself ? taken 30 years ago when he was a natty young blade . " I use it because it does n't look like me , " he laughs . Harsh in his verdicts , Hines drops from his books places that fail to live up to his standards of cleanliness . Early in his gastronomic adventuring , he started going into a restaurant kitchen before  | he ordered his meal . If he found the kitchen dirty , or if the owner re fused to let him see it , he walked out . Many establishments which he once refused to list have cleaned up their kitchens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partitions through which the patrons can watch the food being prepared . Hines ' second test is the food itself . He gives little attention to quaintness , atmosphere . " Candlesticks and decorations do n't make a restaurant , " he says . He plugs for chain restaurants , such as Stouffer 's and the Fred Harvey system , when they live up to his expectations . Many of the places he lists are unpretentious , like the roadhouse outside Chicago frequented mainly by truck drivers , where Hines found better Frenchfried potatoes than in most of the country 's hotel dining rooms . Hines salts his books with pithy gospel to innkeepers . " Many inns and cafes in smaller places might do much better if they would specialize in products near at hand , " he writes . " Why not utilize green corn , cream , eggs , and cheese dishes , good chickens rather than tough meats that must come from a distance ? Too many cooks are still trying to discover something that will take the place of good butter , fresh eggs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his readers , Hines advises : " We Americans have got to get away from the bolt it and beat it ' idea of eating . We 've got to give the cooks more time to prepare food properly . " He hates warmedover dishes . The awakening to good food is most marked , Hines says , in New England . But with the exception of a few " barren areas , " such as the stretch from Chicago to Indianapolis and the western prairies , he has found outstanding places within an hour 's drive of almost anywhere . Hines can spot a good restaurant , he says , by the coffee and soups they serve . He has found the best soups in New England and New York , and the best pies in the Middle West . Hines urges his followers to choose the food of the region ? clams , lobsters and chowder in New England , soft-shelled crabs in Maryland , okra and shrimps in South Carolina , fresh-water fish around the Great Lakes , Spanish dishes in California and Texas . Through his years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some pet gripes . Misnaming foods is one of them . He chalks up a black mark for the restaurateur who lists filet mignon and serves tenderloin , or who serves fresh-water fish as filet of sole . Veal listed as " baby beef " makes him see red . " There 's too much baby on the menu , " he snorts . " Baby beef , baby lamb , baby lobster , baby chicken . Who wants to eat babies ? "  | Fresh vegetables " fresh out of cans " are another of his pet peeves . Hines froths when he is seated at a table not yet cleared of the last patron 's dishes , cheers for the New England custom of taking orders in the lobby and having the appetizers on the table when guests sit down . A special dislike is the restaurant that crowds patrons in like sardines . The real way to get a good meal , says Hines , is to talk with the headwaiter or the owner and tell him the sort of thing you might like , then give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs . " It takes an awful poor cook to spoil a slice of ham , and no cook can disguise bad eggs , " he has discovered . Duncan Hines has turned down fabulous offers for advertising space in his books . " I 'm publishing them for people who want unbiased tips on where to eat and sleep , " he explains . And he has yet to accept his first free meal or complimentary lodging , although mere mention by Hines has saved a number of innkeepers from bankruptcy . An elderly architect who had invested his life savings in a lodge on Cape Cod wrote : " I was about to close my doors , after waiting in vain for patrons , when guests appeared like the robins , all carrying Duncan Hines books under their arms . You saved our lives . " Hines delights in inducing motorists to detour from main highways to find exceptional inns tucked away in mills or barns or distinctive old homes . His books have made it possible for scores of such places to prosper .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
