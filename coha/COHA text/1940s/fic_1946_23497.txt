LOVE MY DOG A Story EMILY HAHN M RS . FLYNN was at the phone . " I thought it would be so nice for her , a dog to play with all day and sleep with at night , " she said , " but it does n't seem to be fair to the dog , now I 've got him . Children manhandle animals so , do n't they ? And it 's so hard to explain to them . " Her friend 's reply was lost in an outcry from the inner bedroom , a thump and a bump and a wail . " Oh God , " said Mrs. Flynn , " there it goes again , probably fatal this time . I 'll ring you later . " She rose quickly from the telephone bench , but before there was time to cross the room her bedroom door flew open and her threeyear-old daughter Barbara appeared on the threshold , clutching in her arms the upper end of a wildly kicking dachshund puppy . His back feet alternately jerked and trailed , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was dappled with dirt and tears , and she howled dismally . " Did he bite you ? " asked her anxious mother , reaching out for the choking dog and swallowing in sympathy . Barbara retreated with her recalcitrant armful , sobbing , " No , he did n't . " " Let me hold him , dear , do n't do that to him . . . . " Mrs. Flynn moved closer , her gaze on the puppy 's popping eyes . " Then what 's the matter with you if he did n't bite you ? What is there to cry about ? " Again Barbara retreated , with an agile twist escaping capture . The struggling dog clawed at her dress . Her grasp tightened around his windpipe and he coughed . " No ! " she said . " He did n't bite me , but he wo n't play . Tell him to play with me , Mommy . " Mrs. Flynn could bear no longer the strangling feeling in her throat . With a sudden leap she succeeded in grabbing the slippery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't hold him like that , " she snapped . " I keep telling you , you must hold him in the middle ; if you wo n't do that then do n't pick him up at all . There , there , puppy , was a baby . " She cuddled the trembling little beast tenderly , but also with difficulty because his long body kept slipping , one section or another , out of her arms . " No wonder he wo n't play , " she told her daughter severely , " when you choke him every time you get hold of him . He 's afraid of you , the poor little thing. - Noisily , Barbara produced fresh tears and ground them into her face with her fists . " He 's not . He 's my dog . He likes me . " " He 'll like you if you 're good to him and do n't handle him so roughly all the time . Dogs like to run around like you , darling . Would you like it if Mommy carried you everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would love it . " She stretched out her arms . " Give him to me , Mommy . He 's my dog . " " Will you be good ? " Absently the child nodded , but Mrs. Flynn was not satisfied . On the baby 's face was that expression which had been troubling her mother more and more , the last few days . It was a brooding , wary , alien look . It was the look of a foreigner on guard , or of a creature from some other element , some lost animal which had strayed quite by mischance into the Flynns ' neat little apartment in the east fifties . It was the look of an animal which keenly resented the entire setup , but could n't get out of it . .. . " If she would only just cry or be plain naughty , " reflected Mrs. Flynn uneasily . Aloud she said , " Let him run , for pity 's sake . Let him run for a few minutes . " She set the dog down on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cockroach , into the bedroom . Mrs. Flynn sighed , looked at her housekeeping list , and phoned the grocer . .. . From the bedroom came a thump and a bump and a wail . This time it was Mrs. Flynn who got there first . She stormed into the bedroom , a tornado of fury . In phony tones Barbara was crying upside down , almost standing on her head in the effort to stretch all the way to the wall , under the bed . She looked up piteously , without changing position : " Make him play with me , Mommy , " she demanded . " Make him come out and play . " Mrs. Flynn steeled her heart against those tears ; she concentrated all her imagination on the trembling puppy whose shadow she could just make out , cowering against the wall . " Stand up , Barbara , " she said . There was no reply , no change of attitude . Barbara remained where she was , small lace-edged drawers much in evidence . Mrs. Flynn reached out , seized her child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her square on her feet . But Barbara seemed to have lost the use of her legs . She slumped to the floor and began to cry in earnest , with practiced ease . It was obviously one of those crises , a subtle struggle for prestige , and Mrs. Flynn fell into the trap . " I 'll have to spank you , " she said , " if you do n't stop being so naughty . Stand up and stop that crying at once . " There was an almost imperceptible pause in the weeping while Barbara totted up the chances of holding on to her advantage . They must have looked good , for she cried afresh with renewed vigor . Mrs. Flynn in a last burst of righteous anger proceeded to spank her quickly , before being forced to administer justice in cold blood . Familiar howls and shrieks rang through the apartment , but then something happened which was not routine . The dachshund puppy wriggled out from under the bed and butted his nose against Mrs. Flynn 's leg , whining furiously . He tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round and round the two of them , adding sympathetic doggish howls to Barbara 's clamor . One would have said that the suffering child had never in her life been cruel to him , her devoted slave , her best pal . Hand in mid-air , Mrs. Flynn stopped spanking and peered at the pup , suddenly reminded of the cause of all this racket . " Well , did you ever ! " she said indignantly . Barbara squirmed to her feet and shook out her dress , while the dog gave her rapturous greeting . " I told you , " she said triumphantly . " I told you he likes me . He 's my dog . " They frisked together , puppy and child , merry and innocently charming as a picture on a Christmas calendar . The dachshund wagged his ratty tail , sat down on his chest while standing up on his back legs , leaped to lick the baby 's face , and gave other evidence of wholehearted trust and affection . " See ? " said Barbara , rubbing it in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which in a way was true , but in another way was n't . D O N'T you think she 's too young for the circus ? " Mrs. Flynn 's phoning friend had asked . " Are n't you afraid she 'll be all stirred up afterward , and have bad dreams about bears and lions and all that ? I heard of a little boy ? " And Mrs. Flynn said confidently , " Not Barbara , my dear . She has no nerves . She 's a city-bred child who can sit through any ballet performance like a mouse or an angel . Why , you should have seen her at the Ice Show . " They had good seats at the circus , front row in a box , and it all started out under the best possible auspices . Happy in a new pink party-dress , Barbara was full of plans . " I want to see Little Red Riding Hood and the big bad wolf , " she said . " Will there be Little Red Riding Hood ? And the woodman to chop up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't think they have that , dear ; this year they 're doing Alice in Wonderland , I think . " " I want Little Red Riding Hood , " said Barbara . " I want that , Mommy . " " Shhhh , you ca n't have everything you want . " " Why ? Why ca n't I ? " " Here come the clowns , " said Mrs. Flynn . The ancient , traditional show proceeded . For a long time Barbara was held in blissful silence . In the center ring the performing sea lions did their balancing acts , and rolled on the sawdust , and clapped their fins . Mrs. Flynn clapped too , in spite of the misgivings that always assailed her at the circus , memories of some book she had read a long time back , about the training of performing animals . Jack London had written it , she was almost sure , and it had been horrid . .. . But maybe conditions were better now for the animals , and the circus program book was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights . Sea lions , said the program , are born hams . They love the smell of greasepaint and the applause of the audience . Besides , they are n't such gentle souls as they seem , or as one would suppose from their innocent faces . They can bite hard and they often do . This item somehow rendered the whole question of sea lion training more agreeable to Mrs. Flynn . If that trainer out there in the ring had really suffered as he prepared the performance , getting all scratched and lacerated , well . . . The familiar high point of the act had arrived . The star sea lion was blowing into a set of horns , " My Country ' T is of Thee . " Time after time when he reached that point he bogged down  --  it was all old stuff to Mrs. Flynn  --  and the crowd clapped wildly and laughed as much as ever . The trainer , with wide pantomimic gestures of exasperation , tried to coax him back to his music , following him across the ring ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the instrument , gave a quick hoot , and slithered away at top speed . The trainer registered wrath and made threatening gestures at the clown seal . It went down very well with the audience ; there were affectionate bursts of laughter and sporadic clapping . Suddenly Barbara screamed . " No , " she yelled , " I do n't want that , / do n't want him to do it , I do n't want it . " " Shhh , Barbara , " said Mrs. Flynn , " do n't be naughty . Be quiet , darling . Wait a minute ; they 'll be finished in just a minute . " The star sea lion was finally persuaded to continue with his act , and after a little more interference from the clown he blew the whole first line , breathlessly fast and without punctuation , through the horns : " My country ' t is of thee sweet land of liberty of thee I sing . " One really half-expected him to go on and perform the entire song , but at that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other sea lions clapped , all of them bowed , the trainer bowed three times over , and the big lights went off . In the intermission the clowns rollicked out for another appearance . " Look , Barbara . " Mrs. Flynn pointed . " Look over there , the funny man with his duck on a leash . " " Ha , ha , " cried Barbara happily , one in spirit with all the other children in the Garden . " And look , just look at that sweet little dog . There with the other clown , " said Mrs. Flynn , warming up . " Look , the dog is doing somersaults . " This suggestion , as it turned out , was a mistake in strategy . Barbara transferred her attention to the little dog just as he walked past their box with his clown , doing a back flip at regular intervals . The trick was admirable in style and performance , but the fox-terrier all too obviously cared more about the clown 's approval than he did about his public . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . He duly turned his somersault just about two yards away from the Flynn box . Mrs. Flynn was just beginning to feel those qualms again when her daughter set up a good clear howl that rang through Madison Square Garden and rivaled the exotic racket of the side show . " No ! " she was screaming . " No ! Stop that clown , I do n't want that clown to do that , I do n't want him to . I do n't want him , Mommy . Stop him ! " " Keep quiet , Barbara ! " Only a louder scream than Barbara 's would have had any effect on the child , and Mrs. Flynn was incapable of producing it . She could feel in her backbone the startled gaze of the hundreds of people behind her , and she turned a bright red . Would the ushers , she wondered wildly , swoop down in a body to throw the Flynns out ? She dared not turn around to see what was happening , so she kept on trying , without success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mommy ca n't make them stop , do n't be ridiculous . . . . Well then , do n't look at the dog if you do n't like him , do you hear me ? Stop that noise immediately ! Stop watching that dog ! " The howls abated at last . " Here , " said Mrs. Flynn , whose brow was wet , " sit on my lap the other way round and look at Mommy 's program . You do n't have to watch . Nobody is going to make you watch the circus if you do n't want to . " " Well , I do n't want to , " sobbed Barbara . But after she had settled down and turned her back to the sawdust she still craned her neck and stared after the clown in fascinated horror . Fortunately he vanished , dog and all , and the other clowns vanished with him , while Mrs. Flynn attempted a little belated reasoning . " Mommy ca n't make the circus stop , darling . What on earth do you think Mommy is ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better go home ? Mommy will take you home now if you want . You do n't have to stay , darling . " " Go home ? " Barbara spoke with incredulous amazement . " Me ? But I like the circus , Mammy . " She climbed down from her mother 's lap and settled into her chair . Calmly , as though there had never been any excitement at all , she proceeded to concentrate her attention on the acrobats . Mrs. Flynn watched her daughter uneasily , uncertainly , but everything seemed perfectly all right . Barbara ecstatically contemplated the lady in pink spangles who hung from a dizzy height by her teeth . To be sure there was a little trouble soon after that , about the man who balances on tables . Barbara suffered in the knowledge that she and she alone in the entire audience was aware of his danger . " He 'll fall , " she explained to her obtuse mother , over and over again ; " look , he 's going to fall . " " I know , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall , do you see ? It does n't hurt him at all ; he wants us to laugh . " The worst , thought Mrs. Flynn , was evidently over now . The child was getting used to things and with a little luck she might even fall asleep . Out in the center ring , a cage was being erected . One of those big closed vans drove up to the grilled gate . " Using only one cage this year , it looks like , " said a man sitting behind Mrs. Flynn . " They lost most of the big cats in the fire . Pity . " " But it 's the best circus I ever saw , " said the woman next to him . " I like it much better streamlined ; it 's not so nerve-racking . " " They used to have three cages at once . " " Who wants three cages at once ? Makes you cross-eyed . " Leopards , black pumas , and ocelots trotted out into the cage and the trainer began his routine , cracking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a rather phony manner , and climbed each his own pedestal without much argument . It took Barbara a little while to get started . Mrs. Flynn almost thought she would remain quiet , but she did n't . Her scream when she let go outdid any circus lion 's roar . She jumped out of her seat and leaped into the air . She leaned over the rail and shouted at the trainer in her high small voice , " No ! No ! No ! " " Barbara , for heaven 's sake ? " " He 's hitting them , Mommy ! " She was severely hampered by the limitations of nursery vocabulary ; she could only say again and again , " He 's naughty . " One small , almost invisible , atom in the vast audience , she struck out at the trainer at long distance with her clenched fist . She panted . " Darling , he 's not hitting them , honestly he 's not . You must stop a minute ; listen to Mommy . Stop that screaming at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending to hit them . He 's cracking the whip . That means he 's making a noise with it but he is n't hitting anything . He really is n't . The cats do n't mind it , Barbara . " " They do , they do . I do n't like it , Mommy , I do n't like it . " Mrs. Flynn suddenly capitulated . " I do n't like it myself , " she admitted . " Let 's read a book and stop watching . " Barbara grew calmer with her back to the ring , but as the whip cracked with special resonance she whirled about and looked again . Impressively , her eyes fixed on her mother 's face , she said , " It  --  makes ? me  --  sick . " " Let 's go home , shall we ? " asked Mrs. Flynn . " Yes , let 's . " But by the time her bonnet ribbons were tied in a bow , the act was over and the cats had been carried away in their van . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wearily , Mrs. Flynn untied the bonnet . .. N o , we 've had no nightmares , " said Mrs. Flynn at the phone , " and since we 've gone so long without them I think we wo n't have any trouble like that . I was worried for a while . We might as well face it in the future ; Barbara does n't like circuses . " Unexpectedly came a voice from behind her . " I do too . " " Oh , I did n't know you were indoors , " said Mrs. Flynn . " You ought to be outside . Helena , call you back in a minute . " She hung up the receiver and turned to face the accusing child . " I do like the circus , " Barbara repeated ; " you said I did n't , but I like it . Can I go to the circus ? " " Next year , darling . . . " Mrs. Flynn 's voice trailed off as she looked beyond her daughter 's head at the floor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on the rug . Where 's the dog , Barbara ? Is that another mess he 's made ? " " Oh yes , he made a mess on the floor . " Wrathfully Mrs. Flynn walked over and investigated . " Come here , puppy , " she said , " look at that . Just look at that . Did n't I just take you out five minutes ago ? " The dachshund crept up with his tail dragging on the floor and his ears flat to his head . Mrs. Flynn seized him and pushed him close to the spot , scolding steadily . " See that ? See that ? Do n't you know better than that ? You 're supposed to do that outside . Look at it look at it . " Pushing his nose at the moist spot , she spanked him with two or three smart taps on the flank . " Bad dog , " she said , " bad dog . " Barbara 's head caught Mrs. Flynn square in the diaphragm . Barbara 's fists and feet beat a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to land . Barbara 's hands grabbed the puppy . Scooping him to her small breast , she fled to the furthest corner of the room . She stood there in the half-dark , silent and sinister , at bay . In the shocked pause , Mrs. Flynn commanded herself to be lucid , reasonable , and firm . With her shin smarting from a chance kick it was difficult to be any of those things except firm , but she managed . She spoke slowly . " We 've got to train the dog , you know , " she said . " Mommy told you all about that , darling . Every little dog has got to learn ? " She stopped , unable to push further against her own panic . She was lonely in the room , and helpless : she was alone . Only two animals crouched in the corner . Two pairs of eyes glittered out of the shadow . Something was there that did n't belong in the east fifties . " Come along , Barbara , " said Mrs. Flynn a little too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some ice cream . " Gloved hand in gloved hand , they set out for a walk .
