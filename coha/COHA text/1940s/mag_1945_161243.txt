The stated policy of the U.S. on cartels is " down with ' em . " In the opinion of many a U.S. businessman , this uncompromising attitude is only half a solution . It leaves unsolved the problem of developing a booming postwar trade with cartel-minded nations . Last week , the potent National Foreign Trade Council , Inc. , whose 700 members expect to do the bulk of this trading , put out its own solution . <P> The National Foreign Trade Council , recognizing what many cartels have done to fix prices and control production to the detriment of consumers , would have the U.S. stand firm against cartels in home in industry . But it would permit U.S. firms to make agreements with foreign cartels , require them to be filed with the Department of State . Unless the State Department found within three months that the agreement unreasonably restrained trade within the U.S. , then the deal would be blessed by the Department . <P> In substance , the N.F.T.C. plan is simi ar to those advanced by such poles-apart individuals as Standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ralph W. Gallagher , and New Dealing Milo Perkins . What was new in the Council 's plan was the implication that the time has come for Congress to clarify U.S. policy on cartels , rather than leave it to definition by liti ious Attorney General Francis Biddle . <P> The Council 's recommendations were based on an exhaustive 130-page survey of foreign trade , sparked by the Council 's white-haired , bespectacled president , Eugene Peeples Thomas , onetime vice president of U.S. Steel Corp . <P> Where 's the Meeting Ground ? Adept at winding his way through the jungle of international trade laws , Thomas wanted to arrive at a common meeting ground for U.S. free enterprise and cartels . He discovered little to comfort free traders . His survey found no hope that the U.S. , despite its mighty economic power , could force an agreement from other nations to end cartel-dealing in the postwar trade world . Instead it concluded that the cartelization of European industry , compulsory in some countries in prewar days , would not be changed by the peace . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries . <P> Under these circumstances , the Council concluded : attempts to use the antitrust laws to reform foreign industries ( as Attorney General Biddle has been trying to do ) would penalize only those firms subject to U.S. laws and jeopardize the U.S. position in postwar international trade . <P> In recommending registration of agreements , the Council would not clip any anti-trust laws . U.S. companies could still be prosecuted if they failed to drop agreements which the State Department frowned on . And the State Department could revoke its approval of an agreement , any time it wanted . But U.S. corporations and businessmen would no longer be harried by antitrust laws , as they sometimes are now : they could not be indicted , under any " new " interpretation of the antitrust laws , for something they thought was perfectly legal at the time they did it .
