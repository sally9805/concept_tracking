The New York Daily Mirror is a rowdy tabloid which flavors its journalism with-gossip , horse-race news , a backfence approach to divorce-case testimony . But last week , to the editorial column of the Daily Mirror , war brought the season 's best homily : <P> " This is for that legion of downy-faced kids , embryo ' whitecollar ' workers , who were sitting around every office in New York about a year ago . . . . <P> " They were the zoot-suit wearers , the jive bombers and the jitter-bugs . . . . <P> " And here 's what we thought of them ; do n't try to deny it now : <P> " . . . Here the world is burning up , and this country may fall into the fire at any time , and there-there ! - sits the younger generation ! . . . <P> " Well , as it turns out , we need not have wondered . . . . We were reminded of this yesterday when the Marine Corps in Washington released the story of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guadalcanal . <P> " The case history of shy and mild-mannered Cook is that he was a Mirror copyboy , who lived at 26 Oliver St. with his mother , liked to dance and have fun , got excited about the motion picture Sergeant York , and came into the office on Dec. 8 , 1941 , and said : <P> ' ' I 'm going to enlist . ' <P> " ' The marines 'll make a man of you , ' we kidded him . And somebody else added , ' But you 'll never be a Sergeant York , Cookie . ' <P> ' ' The Marines it is , ' this kid answered . <P> ' And do n't put any bets on that Sergeant York stuff . ' <P> " We 're glad we did n't , because yesterday 's story tells how Private Cook , wounded , and another marine , wounded , and a third , unwounded , stood off a band of Japs for seven and one-half hours . <P> " Just before help came , Cook and the wounded buddy with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die for his emperor rushed them with a blazing gun . This made our former copy boy mad . He charged and split the Jap 's skull with his rifle butt . <P> " Tommy Cook and his pals never were taught that if you run out and give your life in battle , you win a free ticket to a special warrior 's heaven . They fought on the theory that the best soldier is the soldier who wants to live . And they fought with all the American ingenuity that is their heritage . "
