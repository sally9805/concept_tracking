txt Deep behind the scenes of China 's civil war , the Mohammedan war lords in China 's northwest provinces are pushing plans to set up a new Moslem state which it is hoped will act as a buffer against both Russia and Chinese Communist advances in this region . A new federation , preparations for which now are nearing corn ' pleiton , would include two pre : dominately Moslem provincesChinghai and Ninghsia  --  together with a portion of Kansu , an area roughly the size of France and Germany . It also is hoped that a portion of Sinkiang Province also would be included . Negotiations have been going on for some time between Gen. Ma Pu-feng. war lord governor of Chinghai. and his namesake . Ma Hung-kwei , war lord governor of Ninghsia . Check to Communists Ma Hung-kwei is at present in this city where he is conferring with the Nationalist government and diplomatic quarters . He also is seeking to enlist the cooperation of Yen Hsi-san , war lord governor of Shansi Province , whose capital at Taiyuan has been under Chinese Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lem federation ? formation of which once was attempted by Japanese schemers ,  - -  -  is to stem the onrush of Chinese Communists into the predominately anti-Communist northwest region . Equally significant , however , is the relation which such a new state would have to the recently intensified Russian push into strategic Sinkiang Province . Little attention meanwhile has been focussed on this sparsely populated region of China , which geopoliticians regard as one of the world 's most strategic regions and which is popularly referred to as the heartland of Asia . While the world spotlight has been played on Communist advances in China proper , the Russians during the past couple of months have been quietly making a new attempt to reestablish a foothold in Sinkiang Province , which they gave up suddenly in 1943 . Soviets Seek New Pact Although initial overtures for new Russian mineral exploitation and extension of the 1939 10-year air pact came from the Chinese , the Russians themselves now are pushing for a new treaty after . a period of stalemate in the negotiations . The Russians . according to observers here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it appear later they were seeking to wring concessions from Chinese Communists . If this newly projected Moslem federation becomes firmly established and friendly relations with the United States are instituted . as so far is indicated . it is believed possible that some sort of balance might be maintained to halt any potential Russian penetrations . Prospects for survival of a Moslem federation in this region are partially contingent now upon the building up of adequate military strength . The two Mas now have armies totaling about 150,000 men . They have been receiving limited arms from the Nationalist government . But they are having difficulty meeting the high charges for air freight carried by former Maj. Gen. Claire Chennault 's Central Air Transport Company . They now are trying to make purchases through European arms agencies now operating in Canton . Gen , Ma Pu-feng recently stated he would resist any Chinese Communist efforts to take over his areas . And in this he would not only have the advantage of a well-. trained army but certain terrain advantage which might delay indefinitely Communist military pressure , Vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest developments in this region , Until now , American aid has been extended in the form of relatively small economic development projects being carried out under the Economic Cooperation Administration program . But American interest in this northwest region is patently strong . If nothing else , the region might provide sites for much needed weather stations . Loss of North China stations originally established by Allied engineers has hampered severely air operations in Japan and Okinawa . And establishment of stations in Inner Mongolia would furnish vitally needed data on Siberia , whence most western Pacific weather forms . Another important aspect of the newly projected federation is the encouragement it might give southwest China provinces  --  which at ' present are somewhat . on the fence as to their relations with Chinese Communists . Establishment of an anti-Communist buffer in the northwest might provide precedent upon which such provinces as Szechuan , Yunnan and Sikang might resist Communist penetration  --  at least to the point where it would seriously hamper Chinese Communists ' efforts to consolidate all            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
