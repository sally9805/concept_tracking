U.S. naval air power had stretched its reach the full width of the Pacific . U.S. carrier-borne planes dominated the skies 6,000 miles west of the American mainland . For the first time , they roared up &; down the China coast . If a landing in China was , as Fleet Admiral Nimitz said , " still an objective , " then last week 's forays by Vice Admiral John S. McCain 's fast carrier task force showed that the aerial umbrella to cover it was already available . <P> But that was not the immediate purpose of " Jock " McCain 's strikes . He was beating down enemy air power on a line from Japan through the Ryukyu Islands to the Formosa Strait - bottleneck in enemy communications to points south , notably the Philippines . His planes harried air fields on either side of the 95-mile passage , on Formosa and in China , to prevent reinforcement of the battered Jap air fleets on Luzon , and to keep Formosa-based aircraft from attacking U.S. ships off Luzon . <P> For this purpose , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big , fait carriers of Admiral Halsey 's Third Fleet . He peered through red-rimmed eyes as the air groups were flown off and formed up at dawn , hundreds of miles east of their targets . His chief of staff , Rear Admiral Wilder Du Puy Baker , is a grandfather , but McCain addressed him as " Son . " He addressed everybody on the flag bridge as " Son . " One of them was Commander John S. ( " Jimmy " ) Thach , inventor of the Navy fighter plane technique for Jap-killing , known as the " Thach weave . " <P> Flying Leathernecks . From one of the Essex-class carriers flew two squadrons of new-type Chance-Vought Corsair fighters , piloted by Marine Corps aviators . The marines long ago had won their fight to fly from escort carriers ( TIME , Oct. 23 ) , but this was different ; this was the big time . They went as escort for Avenger torpedo bombers . Grumman Hellcats with Navy pilots made up the rest of this carrier 's complement . It had no dive-bombers-McCain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather closed in , soupy thick , as the southern attack group neared Formosa . ( Western Pacific weather is far different from that of the sunny Gilberts and Marshalls . ) But the 245-mile island was packed with targets ; in the waters to the west were two enemy convoys ; still farther west was Foochow , captured by the Japs only three months ago . At only one point was the enemy able to offer notable opposition : over Shinchiku airdrome , on Formosa , where 15 interceptors rose to give battle , and 12 were shot down . <P> At week 's end , the U.S. fliers ' score for two days was fat : in Jap planes destroyed , 220 damaged ; 25 ships sunk , 58 damaged . By this time McCain had hauled off to the south . He was off Luzon , in the Philippines , looking for trouble . But Jap air power on Luzon was already thinned out ; on the first day , only 41 enemy planes could be found and wrecked .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
