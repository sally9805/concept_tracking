The stock market , sagging since the first of the year , bumped to a seven-year bottom last week . The venerable Dow-Jones industrial stock average hit 98.3 , 14% under 1942 's best , lowest since 1935 . <P> For this sorry show , brokers had two pat reasons : 1 ) lower profits and dividends because of still higher taxes ; 2 ) the long string of United Nations defeats . Brokers ' explanations are usually in the nature of rationalizations , but the effect of war economy on business was unmistakable . Many famous companies have already cut their dividends . Biggest market declines came in companies like Du Pont , Eastman Kodak , Dow Chemical , International Business Machines , whose conservative fiscal methods , progressiveness and aggressiveness had made them blue chips . Under the Treasury-proposed tax program , these sound peacetime policies will hardly pay ; " excess profits " will be taxed 89% . Net will depend very little on good management now , very largely on how much money was earned five years ago or how much money was sunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general lowering atmosphere , * Congressional moves to suspend SEC 's death sentence for the duration did not even help hard-pressed utility shares-they sank to the lowest levels ever . North American , Public Service of New Jersey , Southern California Edison and similar stocks fell so far that they yield 10 to 15% at current dividend rates , sell at one-fifth to one-half their highs in depressed 1933 . <P> Final note of trading gloom : on the New York Stock Exchange , business so far this year has averaged only 428,000 shares daily , poorest since 1918 . <P> * Not everything went down . Encouraged by walloping good railroad income accounts , many speculators and investors switched from stocks to second-grade rail bonds , pushed prices near the 1939 highs . Junior liens of Baltimore &; Ohio , Missouri-Kansas-Texas , Missouri Pacific now sell at two to four times last year 's low prices .
