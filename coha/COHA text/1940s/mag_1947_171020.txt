Ex-A.A.F . Gunner Charles Gorman , who was shot down in Rumania during the war , was in a civilian plane crash last week . Returning from the Cleveland Air Races with a former Army flyer and two young women , the light plane cracked up in the woods near Kenton , Ohio . Charles Gorman 's three companions were killed ; for about 40 hours he lay in the wreckage . Later , in a Kenton hospital , still woozy from the narcotics which eased the pain of his shattered left arm , he tried to tell what it had been like : <P> " I remember the bottom dropped out , and then dropped out again , twice . It was the weather . It was n't the pilot 's fault and it was n't the airplane 's fault . I came to twelve or 15 times , I just do n't remember . I knew where I was and what had happened , but I was kept so busy trying to keep the flies off and trying to move the body from me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last time I woke up , I tried to move the woman off my chest , and the flies were so bad I could hardly stand them . There were millions of flies . <P> " I thought I had better look for a farmhouse . I stumbled from the plane and walked toward the edge of the woods . All I wanted to do was get away . It took me about 400 years to walk and crawl to a farmhouse about a quarter of a mile away . <P> " It was not at all like being shot down . This was just nothing . "
