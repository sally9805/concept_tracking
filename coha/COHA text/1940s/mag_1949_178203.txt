When the National Museum 's greying Eulalia Guzmn announced in the backwoods village of Ixcateopan that " the remains of the last emperor of the Aztecs have been found " ( TIME , Oct. 10 ) , all Mexico went wild . Nearly every town in the country held a special fiesta ; on Columbus Day , Dia de la Raza , the discoverer was nearly forgotten in the flowery eulogies of Cuauhtemoc , last chief of the discovered . <P> Though the government set up a commission to investigate the find , hardly anyone doubted its authenticity . The Bank of Mexico 's research laboratories announced that the documents which led to the unearthing of Cuauhtemoc 's bones were indeed 400 years old , and that the ink , writing and signature on them appeared genuine . Leading archaeologists agreed . Crowds of tourists began to make the five-hour trip over rock-strewn roads from Taxco to the Ixcateopan church , where they goggled at a few shoe boxes full of bone fragments and the copper disc found under the altar bearing the inscription : " Seor y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission , headed by Manuel Gual Vidal , Minister of Education , made a bone-chilling announcement . " The documents and copper disc inscription , " it stated flatly , " are both false . . . Taking into consideration the examination of the human bones which turned out to be those of five persons , one of them a woman and at least two children , this commission concludes that there are no scientific proofs to permit confirmation that the remains are those of the Emperor Cuauhtemoc . " <P> Proclaiming her unshaken belief that the bones actually were those of the last Aztec ruler , Eulalia Guzman packed up for another trip to Ixcateopan . The red-faced Bank of Mexico kept its own counsel . One question remained unsolved : Was the hoax the work of a 20th Century man , or had it been perpetrated by some long-forgotten 16th Century prankster ?
