By 10 a.m. , crowds had jammed every available inch in the old House caucus room . Motion-picture and television cameras stood tripod to tripod , electrical cables matted the floor like jungle vines . Both crowds and cameramen had come with a single purpose : to watch James Caesar Petrillo , the union boss of all U.S. musicians , dropped into the legislative meat grinder and publicly reduced to scrapple . <P> The House Education and Labor Committee was in a bitter and bilious mood . Its members had spent six days investigating Petrillo 's practices . They had heard the big men of the record business deplore his record ban . They had listened while the big men of the radio networks denounced his ban on television and his refusal to let FM stations share standard musical broadcasts . But they had been unable to draw forth suggestions for punitive legislation . The big men wanted to negotiate with Petrillo , not demolish him . Somewhat frustrated , the G.O.P. committee members swore that they themselves would reduce Caesar to size . <P> Touch of Sadness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petrillo sat down in the bright glare of the lights . He was dressed as quietly as a banker and he smiled a happy smile , like a man back at last among his dearest friends . <P> He immediately drew fire from New Jersey 's redheaded Congressman Fred Hartley , committee chairman and coauthor of the Taft-Hartley Act . Hartley 's voice trembled with outrage as he cried : " Do you know that the London Gramophone Corp . is flying records to the United States , and that it brought in twelve tons this week and that 250,000 more records are on the way ? These British companies will make lots of " money . . . . " <P> Petrillo spoke quietly and with just a touch of sadness . " If they do , I hope they will treat their musicians a lot better than American companies treated our musicians . " <P> After that Petrillo took over the hearing . At times he was a frankly bewildered man , asking the committee 's advice and guidance . " Are we right , or are we wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry what is the future of television . They tell me , ' Jim , we do n't know . ' " <P> Bit of Laughter . He was reassuring . He hinted strongly that he could reach a peaceful settlement in his present negotiations with the radio networks . FM ? Television ? He was " keeping an open mind on those questions . " He made it plain that James Caesar Petrillo had a heart which beat for the public . He and his musicians were perfectly willing to make records for home phonographs ; they refused only because 20% of the product was used by radio stations and jukeboxes without payment of royalties to the musician or the union . <P> At times , his answers set off uproarious waves of laughter . At one point he complained that musicians were too poor even to patronize the nightclubs in which they played . Illinois Republican Thomas L. Owens quoted back a statement of President Harry Truman 's that everybody had a lot of spending money . Petrillo beamed . " I do n't contradict the President , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player , he 's a potential member of the union . "
