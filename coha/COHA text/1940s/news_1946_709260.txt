txt 1,666 Brides , 688 Children Here on the Queen Mary Liner , Converted Into a Floating Nursery , Brings Largest Number Yet to Arrive ? Women Worried Over Reception By LUCY GREENBAUM The liner Queen Mary , converted , into a floating nursery , docked , yesterday in New York after al historic trip across the Atlantic . She carried 1,666 war brides and , 688 children , the largest number ever transported to these shores . The brides , who had been worrying about adjusting to American customs , had their ears blasted by one before they even /stepped off the ship . As the Queen Mary at 12:45 P. M. crunched her way through chunks of ice that surrounded Pier 90 , escorted by twelve Army tugs , the music of Brahms ' " Lullaby " wafted across the short span of water separating the ship ' from the pier in the jive rhythms lof a " solid " band . The 378th Army Service Forces band from Fort Hamilton played as encore an equally " hot " version of " Rock-abye-Baby . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck where they jammed against the rails , they applauded wildly and waved colored kerchiefs . Some swung their shoulders to the rhythms ; others clapped together the tiny hands of their babies whom they held tightly . Faces shone jubilant and gay , for the brides were happy to arrive in the United States , and yet behind the gaiety lurked fear  --  fear of their reception here . For the most part they did not consider their venture into a new land a lark , but a serious responsibility , and they were wondering how deep went the resentment of American girls toward them because they had married American boys . On the voyage over they attended daily orientation courses in the ship 's elegant lounge , eagerly drinking in information about the different sections of this nation and correcting exaggerated or im , mature impressions , but underneath all this ran an " undercurrent of anxiety , " according to Wac Capt . Reida Longanecker of Gettysburg , Pa . She was assistant transport commander and liaison officer aboard ship . Reporters started to ask Captain // Longanecker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say-ing : " You tell me something . These girls have asked one thing over and over again ? Are the girls in the Unfted States going to resent our coming over ? ' It was always when we were in  --  a little quiet group together aboard the ship . They would repeat ' Are they going to accept us ? Are they going to accept us ? ' " Praises British Accents She said she told the brides they had a legal right to be here , that they belonged here and that it was up to each of them individually to adjust . She also told them , she said , " to retain their beautiful British accent because Americans found it wholly attractive . " She praised the behavior of the children , saying she had never seen " so many smiling , blue-eyed , curly-haired , blonde little babies . " Then she added , " good-natured , except for colds . " The press was not permitted , to interview the brides , who were kept on the ship until 6 P. M. when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armory , there to be met by hus bands . But several of the out numbered 100 civilians who were not Army or Navy personnel de pendents , and who debarked , de scribed the brides . One of these was Representative Sol Bloom , an alternate to the United Nations assembly meetings in London , who said he told the children they would see Indians , when they got out West . He also watched the brides hold a quiz program as part of the entertainment abroad . " You 'd be surprised at what some of those brides knew , " he commented . Representative Bloom expressed no surprise at the resentment of residents of the **30;1560;TOOLONG area over the selection of their region as a possible site for the capital of the United Nations . " Would n't it ? iappen any place ? " he asked . " Wherever UNO goes , they 'll have to inconvenience someone . We inconvenienced people in San Francisco , turning them out of homes and hotels . We inconvenienced them in London . " UNO is for the peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few persons who live in one area . " Careful Plans Go Awry At 6:50 P. M. , when the first busload of brides reached the Seventh Regiment Armory , at Park Avenue and Sixty-sixth Street , they precipitated a seesaw battle between the carefully mapped plans of the Army , Navy and Red Cross and the emotions of husbands and relatives . The plan was to have husbands and relatives wait in the balcony until summoned by , a loudspeaker to receive bride and children on the huge dtill floor . But within five minutes a large number of the 2,500 persons in the gallery had poured onto the floor and crowded around the Lexington Avenue entrance to the armory , where the women were brought . While Red Cross workers held infants , husbands and wives embraced . Military Police cleared the floor , but it soon refilled . After nearly an hour , the original plan was in working order . For several hours before the brides reached the armory , husbands and visitors began filling the east side of Park Avenue between Sixty-sixth and Sixty-seventh Streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened , shortly after 6 P. M. , the block was jammed . Husbands admitted they were more nervous than the day they were married and asserted the Army was " snafuing " the job . While waiting in the cold . they exchanged stories of their romances , recalled war experiences . Many of the husbands had not eaten all day nor slept the previous night . One had driven in from Texas . There was one lone " war groom " on the Queen Mary . Lieut , Comdr . Robert H. Burrows of Bermuda , on terminal leave after his discharge from the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve after almost seven years ' service , came here to join his wife , the former Nancy Naylor Dennis of Bennington , Vt. , whom he met in Washington when she was a Wac sergeant . They have a twomonth-old daughter , Margaret . " It certainly was an unusual trip , traveling with all those brides , " he said . He said he did not see much of the women for they ate in a separate dining room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day and a half was rough . But the women stuffed so on food and candy from the canteen that many were sick from overating . " They had n't seen a chocolate bar in years or had enough white bread or meat , " explained Col. William R. Barnett , Army transport commander . " There was a tendency to overeat , and many of them got sick . " He said breakfast proportions were cut down . Colonel Barnett , for whom this was the ninety-fourth crossing , his first with war brides , said the trip over was " just ordinary , " and added , " I guess shore officials were more worried about it than we were . " The ship slowed up speed after a day at sea so that traveling was more comfortable , he said . There was no serious illness aboard . Maj. Seelig Freund of New York City , ship surgeon , reported that four children came down with measles . Two small boys had broken out in a rash just as the ship entered New York Harbor and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two little girls , who had caught the disease earlier , were lucky . They had been discharged from sick bay . Six to a Stateroom The brides traveled six to a stateroom , where during troopship days eighteen fighting men were jammed . If there were children , each child would take the place of a bride . The babies traveled in small cribs tied to the edge of bunks . The-brides came from all parts of the British Isles and they were bound for every State in this country . New York will be home for 270 ; 500 will live within a radius of 200 miles of New York City . In addition to the young brides aboard , whose average age was 22 , there was one grandmother , Mrs. Dora A. , aged 65 , of Aberdeen , Scotland , the mother of a lieutenant commander of Piedmont , Calif . There were also two widows . They were Mrs. Edna M. Quincy , bound for Clinton , Me. , and Mrs. Kathleen Ramsey , for Wilmette , Ill . Mrs. Ramsey had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was a transatlantic telephone call for her . It was her husband 's father in Wilmette who told her that her husband , Corp . John Ramsey , had died suddenly . He begged her to come to America , anyway , so he could see the children , Janette , 2 , and John , 1 . The ship 's arrival rated as one of the city 's main attractions yesterday . A thousand persons gathered in the cold across the street from the pier to watch the liner dock . Of yesterday 's arrivals 466 were dependents of Navy personnel . Of the total number of war brides , 404 were expectant mothers . The women who will go to different sections of the United States will debark from the ship all day today , taken by Army buses from the pier to the railroad stations . 1,132 More on the Way By Wireless to THE NEW YORK TIMES .

FULL York this morning with 1,132 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings the total number of GI brides and children who have left Southampton for America to 4,500 . Meanwhile , the case of the 200 British wives who are being divorced under United States law by their husbands now back in America is being taken up by the Married Women 's Association here . The association is urging that United States authorities should either make arrangements for these wives to go to America to defend themselves or set up machinery to enable them to be properly represented there . " In most cases the husbands are divorcing them for the flimsiest reasons , " Miss Juanita Frances , chairman of the association , said today . " Some of the women have children and if they 're divorced they can claim no maintenance allowance for them . " The association has attempted to enlist the sympathy of Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt who , it was reported , will try to find time to receive a deputation before leaving the country .
