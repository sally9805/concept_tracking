Snow lay deep on the hills around Oslo . On Christmas Day , as always , Norwegians thronged the ski slopes . Men over 45 and boys under 18 , outside the Nazi slave-labor brackets , began practicing for this winter 's illegal championship , the fourth since Norway 's athletes went on strike . <P> The sports strike started in November 1940 , when Nazis suppressed the Norwegian Sports Association with its 300,000 members , a tenth of the population . Patriots rebelled at the New Order 's all-powerful little Fhrers in every sport and district . They substituted secret cross-country meets and ski championships . <P> The boycott was immediately effective . The world-famed ski meet on Holmenkollen , attracting 450 crack jumpers , was abandoned . When quislings tried to organize their own Holmenkollen meet , only 20 nonentities signed up . When a quisling was made president of the Oslo Gymnastic Society , all 7,000 members resigned . Sixty-four wrestlers signed up for matches with Denmark . Day of the elimination contests , not one appeared . <P> Hitler &; Himmler . <P> Skiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Garmisch-Partenkirchen . Himmler went to Norway and repeated the invitation , with threats . No results . Olympic Champion Birger Ruud announced that he would burn his skis before he would compete in compulsory Germanic sports . <P> Next the Nazis tried terror . Two famed skiers , Krisitian Aubert and Tor Salvesen , were questioned by the Gestapo ; burly torturers trampled on their chests until shattered ribs pierced their lungs . Skater Ivar Ballanrud and scores of other athletes were arrested . But of Norway 's 300,000 organized sportsmen , no more than 1% went over to the quislings . <P> A few matches were finally held . Only 90 people turned out to watch the first day of a national skating championship . Last fall 's football ( soccer ) championship drew only a handful . Oslo 's Bislet Stadium was deserted when track &; field championships were held last summer . <P> Sports Underground . <P> As in Czecho Slovakia , this sports sabotage soon became the prototype and nucleus of the underground movement . Though many of Norway 's top athletes have escaped to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Most dangerous part of the strike are the surreptitious championships , particularly in skiing . Last winter 's ended in tragedy . One Sunday afternoon , 90 crack jumpers mysteriously appeared on a hillside near Oslo . Asbjoern Ruud had barely made the winning leap of 72 meters ( 234 ft. ) when the police arrived . The new champion was dragged off to concentration camp along with 24 other competitors . <P> Eventually released because of tuberculosis , he will be too weak to jump this winter . His famed brothers , Birger and Sigmund , who both cleared 70 meters at last winter 's meet , will also be missing . They are in Kongsvinger prison .
