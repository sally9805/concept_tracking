TRELAWNY-Margaret Armstrong-Macmillan ( $3 ) . <P> Edward Trelawny knew Shelley some six months , Byron two years , but he wrote ( 30 years later ) the most colorful firsthand report of their strange doings-Recollections of the Last Days of Shelley and Byron . Last fortnight Margaret Armstrong ( Fanny Kemble ) reported the even stranger doings of Edward Trelawny , showed him to have been more Byronic than Byron . <P> Born in 1792 , Edward Trelawny , like all the Romantics , was a spiritual child of the Great French Revolution . When ( age 9 ) he beat up a schoolmaster , his father signed him up for a trick in Nelson 's Royal Navy . At navigation school Edward went birding one day with another boy , shot him , was shipped off to sea . <P> In Bombay the young sailor met a mysterious American named De Ruyter , one of several men for whom he was to develop romantic attachments . He shipped with him in a privateer . Armed with six 9-pounders , manned by a miscellaneous crew of Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely little craft " was also stocked with a library . By night De Ruyter and Trelawny ( dressed as an Arab ) lay on deck , gazing at the Southern Cross during " endless discussion of freedom and revolution . " By day they sank other ships , rescued no survivors . Trelawny rescued a sheik 's daughter from African pirates , married her , took her privateering around the Indian Ocean until she died ( of poison ) . Brokenhearted Trelawny burned her body on a pyre . <P> His return to England was perfectly timed . Byron had written the early cantos of Childe Harold . Young ladies were dreaming of giaours , Manfreds , Mazeppas , with wild eyes , black mustaches , long cloaks , wicked pasts . In Lausanne one day Trelawny read Shelley 's Queen Mab . He rushed to Pisa to meet the satanic author , was astonished at Shelley 's " flushed , feminine and artless face , " soon felt as romantic about Shelley as he had about De Ruyter . <P> Trelawny also met Byron . Yachting , Trelawny found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry and revolution . He got a boatbuilder friend to construct the Bolivar for Byron , the Ariel for Shelley . One day Shelley , a very bad sailor , sailed off with two friends and copies of Sophocles and Keats . A few days later their bodies were washed ashore . Trelawny built more funeral pyres . While Byron and Leigh Hunt tossed incense , salt , sugar and wine , Trelawny lit the flames under Shelley 's fish-eaten , livid corpse . Said Trelawny : " I restore to nature , through fire , the elements of which this man was composed . . . . " Said Byron : " Why , Trelawny . . . you do it very well . " But when Trelawny handed Mary Shelley her husband 's " little black shrivelled " heart , the authoress of Frankenstein was horrified . <P> Trelawny and Byron decided to liberate Greece . But when Byron died at Missolonghi , Trelawny was not with him . He had met another " glorious being , " a patriotic Greek outlaw named Odysseus , " a Bolivar who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turks together . Soon Trelawny ( in a Greek kilt ) was living with the Odysseus family in their mountain cave , had married Odysseus ' half sister . But she was too fond of European fashions , and they parted . " Marriage , " wrote Trelawny , " is a most unnatural state of things . "
