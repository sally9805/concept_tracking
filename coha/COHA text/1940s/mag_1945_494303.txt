Homes for the Vets by Ralph G. Martin THE ROOM was packed with people who swelled out into the hall , down the stairs , and formed a line that stretched almost the length of the block to the corner of Harrison Avenue . Inside this Bronx office of the American Veterans ' Committee , interviewers were calling out numbers . Number 103 sat down heavily and the first question came quick and cutting : " Are you disabled ? " Stanley Billauer , once a private with the Third Battalion of the 357th Regiment of the 9oth Division , started to smile , as if he had thought of something funny , and then he said , " Yes , I 'm disabled . " He and his wife were living with his folks but they wanted a place of their own , he said . They wanted three rooms , and if they could n't get that , then they 'd take two , and if they could n't get two , they 'd take anything . Only it would have to be on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new leg I 've got and I 'm not really used to it yet . " In the next few minutes the interviewer explained the whole set-up . As soon as the Waves moved out of these 11 buildings , the landlords would make 600 of the 75o apartments available to veterans selected by the AVC . The selection was based on a priority system , with the Purple Hearts coming first , and then those who were overseas longest . Doctors also received special consideration . But the apartments could n't be ready until some time in January or February . The interviewer 's final advice was , " Do n't stop looking . " After Billauer had left , the interviewer seemed puzzled . " I do n't get it , " he said . " I 've had six amputees so far this morning and you 'd think that at least some of them would start bitching , but none of them have . I tried to get a reaction out of the last guy , and do you know what he said ? He said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roof over my head and a cot to sleep on . ' And I thought they 'd all be so bitter . " Next to sit down was a young plump girl with frightened eyes . " Everything 's happening next month all at once , " she said nervously . " I 'm gon na have a baby and my husband 's getting discharged and so is my brother , and where we all gon na live ? " She was living with her mother and her brother 's Wife and children in a tiny three-room apartment , she Ralph G. Martin , a farmer combat correspondent for S:ars and Stripes and Yank , covered the campaigns in Tuti4a , Sicily , France and Germany . He has also contributed extensively to the New York Times Sunday Magazine Section . Before the war he was a newspaperman in Utah.said . For months now she had read all the newspapers and gone to all the agencies and walked up and down the streets and she still had n't found anything . While she was talking , she kept staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke down . " Please do n't discourage me , " she said . " I 've been discouraged so much already . I came here all the way from Brooklyn . " When she left , the interviewer wiped his face . " Jeezus , what the hell can I do ? " he said . " My wife and I ca n't find anything either . We 've been living with her folks for two months and that 's two months too much . And I do n't even rate on this set-up here because I was n't overseas long enough and I never got wounded . " The numbers kept running quickly into each other , and every story was something special : " I am looking for an apartment for my son . He was an infantryman with the 45th Division in Germany . Right now I 'm sleeping on the couch so he can sleep with his wife in my bed . But I 've got a wife , too ... . " " My wife and I got two wonderful kids and we 're living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over everything , because we could n't find any place else . How can you raise kids in a place like that ? . " No , I do n't have any husband . He was killed in the Philippines . I 've been living with my girl friend , but now her husband 's getting out of the Navy . I do n't know where to go . . . . " " You mean to say you do n't have any furnished apartments available ? Well , you 're certainly not very efficient around here , are you ? .. . " " My son Sammy does n't want to come home . He lost both legs at Anzio and he says he wo n't come home until we move to some other neighborhood . You see , he was born and raised in this neighborhood and everybody knows him and he just does n't want any pity . . . . " " Look , we just got married a couple months ago and my wife has to sleep at the YWCA and me at the YMCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " Listen , mister , I do n't want any sympathy . I just want a place to live .... " The room was full of noise but the noise stopped completely the minute a tall AVC member got on a chair with a white piece of paper in his hand . " I want your attention , please , " he said . " We just got a letter from a landlord who wants to rent a three-room flat . There 's no hot water but there is a private toilet . The rent is $17 a month . Is anybody interested ? " Several people came quickly to the desk to get the address , including a thin little man who said apologetically to nobody in particular , " This is just in case we ca n't get anything else . " 1 HE MAN who made the announcement went back to his crowded table to sort out the rest of a big batch of mail . His name was Irving Katz and he was just discharged . He was a lawyer , he said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for six people to live in two rooms . Then he shoved over some of the letters . One was from a man who said he could n't understand why the city did n't buy up some of those huge , deserted estates on Long Island and build a lot of homes for veterans . Another was from Halloran Hospital and certified that Pfc . Martin Slitsky , ASN 3252744 , was paralyzed from the waist down and could n't be released unless he had an apartment on the ground floor or in a building with an elevator . Still another letter , on expensive blue stationery , was from a man who said that his heart was touched by the veterans ' plight and he would be glad to sell one of his houses to some needy veteran for $4,500 . Then there was an eight-page letter that said : " All of a sudden out of the Deep Blue Sky , everybody is looking for apartments . I think that everybody that is not born in these five boroughs should be sent back where they belong . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bronx , Staten Island , Long Island should stay here and the ones that are from out of town should go back to Washington , Chicago and South California . " Bunched in the back of the room , waiting for their numbers to be called , several new civilians were saying something similar . They were saying that the farmers who went to work in the shipyards during the war ought to go back to their farms . " But it is n't as if there are n't any empty apartments in this town , " said an air-corps lieutenant who still wore his uniform . " I was talking to a real-estate friend of mine and he told me there 's supposed to be a 25-percent turnover of apartments in this town every year , war or no war , " he said , beginning to get angry . " It 's just that a lot of sonofabitch superintendents wo n't rent you an apartment unless you slip them a couple hundred bucks first . I know a guy who shelled out $500 for his place . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's going on . " " Hell they do n't , " said a big , heavy guy who might have been a master sergeant or a major . " A lot of those landlords got private rackets all their own . They throw a few pieces of broken-down furniture into an apartment and then say they 'll only rent it to you if you buy the furniture . My buddy paid $700 like that , then threw the junk out as soon as he moved in . Somebody ought to crack down on those bastards . " There was a minute 's silence because some more numbers were being called out , then an ex-corporal with a lot of ribbons and six battle stars broke out bitterly , " I 'll bet this place is a racket , too . If I slipped those interviewers some dough , I 'll bet I 'd get an apartment in a hurry . " Somebody on the fringe of the crowd , who had been listening , interrupted , " You 're all wet there , bud . These guys are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black mustache and glasses . " That one 's a doctor . He takes time off from his practice to help out . " Then he pointed to a short , thin man . " And that guy was in the same outfit with me in France . He should be looking for a job instead of helping here . " The corporal shrugged his shoulders . " Well , maybe I 'm wrong then , " he said grudgingly . " Maybe this one is on the level . I 've bumped into so many phonies , though , that I 'm suspicious of everything . " From there the talk shifted to solutions . Nobody seemed to be very happy about the idea of living in prefabricated houses in Flushing , even if it was temporary . It was too much like the old army barracks all over again , they said . Oh , they 'd live there all right , they 'd live anywhere , but it just was n't the kind of thing they used to dream about in those water-filled foxholes . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livable by installing toilets and hot water . One quiet little man said that the way he understood it , the reason for the big delay in building was that construction materials were expensive now and all the builders were waiting until costs went down . T 'S THE SAME old story , " said the corporal with the I battle stars again . " You fight a goddam war and you finally come home and everybody slaps your back and tells you what a wonderful job you did and all that crap , but when it comes to really doing something , then nobody 's home . Nobody seems to know from nothing . All you get is words . " There was a pause after that , everybody silently agreeing . Then a young ex-sailor told the story of a cousin of his whose husband was overseas and she was so desperate to find a place to stay that she answered an ad for a governess . It was a nice room and a nice kid . But then the kid 's father decided that he wanted just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out of the house , he almost raped her , " said the sailor . The big , heavy guy smothered a laugh . " If I have to get raped to get an apartment , it 's okay by me . " The laughter that followed was broken up by the interviewers bawling out some more numbers and this time several of the group got up in a hurry . Soon the only ones left were the quiet little man and the young sailor . The little man nodded his head toward an end table where a Negro was being interviewed . " That 's another reason why it 's difficult to get apartments , " he said in a low voice . " A lot of landlords do n't advertise their apartments because they 're afraid that these colored people will try to rent them , and I think there 's some kind of law now that you ca n't refuse an apartment to a man just because he 's colored . " At the table , the Negro being interviewed was a big , husky young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Pacific with the aviation engineers . His name was Robert Cottrel and this was his first stop on an apartment hunt , he said . His wife was going to New York University and he was looking for a job here . He had a theory , he said , that many Negroes created their own walls of segregation . " Of course , " he added slowly , " I do n't want to live where I 'm not wanted . " Hours later , when only a few people were left , the interviewers relaxed over some cigarettes . The only woman there told of her last customer , a young girl who had recently had triplets and her husband never got to see them because he was killed in Germany . Well , this girl now lived with some relatives in a crowded apartment on the fourth floor and she had to make two trips up and down to carry all the babies . She was thin and weak to begin with , and just could n't take it any more . She wanted a ground-floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , cry on your shoulder ? " said the lawyer impatiently . " They 're all tough cases . She and 2,000 others , and all we got is 600 apartments . I ca n't understand why the state and the city did n't plan for this a long time ago . They knew it was coming . " " There was one sailor who had a funny idea , " said the man who had a pants business in Passaic . " He said that instead of scrapping all the LST 's , the government ought to line them up along the docks and convert them into houses . " " What 's so funny about it ? " said the lawyer . " It 's better than pup tents in Central Park . Somebody better do something soon , that 's all . " Everybody said goodnight and the only ones left in the office were the policeman from the 44th precinct , a man fixing the telephone , and Katz . Somebody knocked on the door and the cop looked inquiringly at Katz , who finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a poorly dressed little woman with a firm face who promptly opened up with , " Please , me no speak English so good . Me got four sons in Army and my man was hurt in last war and we always try so hard to keep whole family together and now my sons come back home and we have no room for them . Please , mister , do you know place with more rooms for all of us ? " Later , when the policeman said goodnight , all he could think of to say was , " It all seems like such a damn shame , do n't it ? "
