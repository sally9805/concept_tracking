txt The incredible dual career of Gus Fusaro as an . assistant elevator starter and big-time stock market operator came to an end yesterday . District Attorney Frank Hogan , in announcing Fusaro 's indictment and arrest on a grand larceny charge , said he had squandered almost a quarter of a million dollars of other people 's money in stockmarket operations since Jan. 1 , 1945 . These huge sums were entrusted to Gus for stock purchases by " clients , " the prosecutor declared , on the sole representation that he was a confidante of brokers and a recipient of their market tips and would thus make their fortune . After nearly thirty years of service as an elevator operator in the Equitable Building at 120 Broadway , Gus recently was promoted to assistant starter . His Isalary was something less than $2,500 a year . Yet in 1946 , trading through a brokerage house in the building , Gus purchased stocks valued at more than $750,000 , Mr. Hogan asserted . Fusaro 's market operations are believed to go back , in a smaller way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total he lost for his gullible victims , Mr. Hogan said . A two-month investigation by the Frauds Bureau , the prosecutor declared , disclosed that Fusaro had lost $247,000 in stock deals since 1945 . The money for the purchases was given him by a score of fellow-employes , acquaintances whom he met through his job and his neighbors on the lower East Side . The portly , 53-year-old Fusaro , father of five children , lived through the entire period of his stock deals in a modest $40-amonth flat at 87 Madison Street . All this time , the District Attor // ney said , Gus was buying and selling stocks in the tens of thousands of ' dollars and a total of $569,000 was passing through his Check-0-Matic ten-cents-a-check account in I the Empire Trust Company at 120 Broadway . Yesterday his balance ' was $30.21 . Mr. Hogan described Fusaro 's operations as " fantastic . " He said he would utilize his rest and luncheon periods almost daily to go to the offices of Laird , Bissell &; Meeds , a New York Stock Exchange firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stock transactions . As often as not he would be in uniform . There he had his own desk and telephone and would meet his clients . When one of his " custom ; ers " came in , according to the prosecutor , Gus would point to an ornate chair and say " that 's my chair on the Stock Exchange . " A stock quotation board in the firm 's offices became the Exchange 's I " Big Board . " Charles D. Halsey , managing partner of the brokerage concern , said yesterday he could not estimate the extent of Fusaro 's stock transactions but that they were considerable . " He was a good customer and had a ' pretty active account at times , " Mr. Halsey said . " But he was never " employed by us and we never paid him a cent either in commissions or salary . We had no knowledge , of course , that he was handling other people 's money . The account was in his own name and that 's all we knew about it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was thought to be pretty wealthy . " Airy Response to Query Asked whether it did n't appear strange that a $50-a-week employe engaged in such extensive trading , Mr. Halsey said the question had come up and that Gus had said airily : " ' Oh , I get a lot of information , I 've been here for years and I like my job . ' " Mr. Halsey said Gus always paid his obligations , that he closed out his account several weeks ago and that " he does n't owe us a dime . " The firm still carries some options purchased by Fusaro , Mr. Halsey said , but he declared that if he claimed them " he wo n't make any money ; they are a little bit away from the market now . " As to his occupying a ' desk in the office , the stock broker said that the practice was generally followed by other houses as an accommodation to good custorhers . " When he came up , " Mr. Halsey added , " fairly frequently he asked to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing all day , and I guess he wanted to sit down . We told him he could use this desk , the same as we do with other customers who like a desk of their own . " One of Worst Traders Although he posed as a sage of Wall Street with access to inside knowledge of the market to the average individuals who let him have disproportionately large sums , a scrutiny of his stock deals indicated he was one of the world 's worst traders , according to the district attorney . He promised to buy " blue chip " stocks but bought instead for the most part " cats and dogs , " Mr. Hogan disclosed . In consequence of this , Mr. Hogan declared , his special checking account showed insufficient funds on seventy-four occasions . This did not disturb Gus in the slightest . Officiating on the bank of elevators that take passengers from the twenty-sixth to the thirty-second floors , Fusaro would ride up to the twenty-eighth floor to the brokerage offices . There he would obtain needed funds , deposit them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give the brokerage house a check for the money it had advanced him . " It 's what you might call kiting and double kiting , " the District Attorney remarked . " Only an elevator man could move fast enough to do this . " Fusaro , Mr. Hogan said , " kept his records in his head and had no books . " A few persistent persons managed to get their money back but all the others got only promises , he said . One Family Lost $140,000 Among the largest losers , Mr. Hogan disclosed , was the Esposito family , engaged in the wholesale and retail meat business at 73 Mulberry Street . Its " investments , " without a return , amounted to $140,000 over the years . The father , Joseph Esposito , was the initial victim . He died last October but his children , Louis and Beatrice , continued putting their money down the Fusaro stock drain . " We never saw a share of stock , " they said yesterday . " All we got were Gus 's personal receipts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vault in the building where he worked . " Gus occasionally paid dividends but invariably insisting the Esposito account was short , got the family to endorse the dividend check back to him . The indictment recited that neighbors gave Fusaro sums of $16,000 and $1,089 for stock purchases , that a Brooklyn mc , n lost $500 and Mrs. Gladys Owens Polacek , a secretary employed in the Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe Railroad offices on the twentyninth floor of the Equitable Building . $800 . Fellow elevator operators and starters said yesterday that " Gus was a real nice guy that never hurt anybody here . " Even one who gave him $150 with which to buy stocks ten years ago and never got the money back was without bitterness . " I always thought he was one of the best , " he said . Fusaro , short and stocky with eparse brown hair flecked with gray and wearing gold - rimmed glasses , was held in $15,000 bail upon his arraignment in General sessions . He was dressed neatly in a single-breasted gray tropical suit with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . Judge John J. Sullivan when told the story said : " I ca n't believe my ears . This sounds like something out of ' Alice in Wonderland . ' Did n't the stock brokers and the bank know about this ? Did n't they know that he was an elevator operator ? " " I assert that they did , " replied Assistant District Attorney Francis C. Leffler . Judge Sullivan turned down the plea of Fusaro 's lawyer for lesser bail .
