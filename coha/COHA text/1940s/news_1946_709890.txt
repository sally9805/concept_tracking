txt Meat-hungry housewives and their families turned eagerly to their radios last night to listen to the President 's speech on price stabilization . " What about meat ? " was-the question uppermost in their minds . President Truman 's announcement that controls over meat and iivestocit prices would be lifted answered the immediate question of what the future policy would be . Many listeners greeted the announcement with joy ; others were dubious , some frankly skeptical . After the first reaction there came other questions . How soon the corner meat market would have a stock of meat was the prime concern of the housewife . Her next question was : What will it cost ? First reactions from leaders of distributors ' associations were approving , while spokesmen of labor and consumers ' organizations were critical . A. F. Guckenberger , executive secretary of the New York State Food Merchants Association , said decontrol seemed " the only possible solution to the whole meat situation . " Agreement with this opinion was expressed by Patsy D'Agostino , chairman of the Greater New York Retail Grocers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had " waited for meat lines and meat famine " before deciding to remove controls . In opposing this viewpoint , Mildred A. Gutwillig , chairman of both the New York City Consumer Council and the Consumer Committee of the United Neighborhood // Houses of New York , and Meyer Stern , director of the Eastern seaboard district of the United Packinghouse Workers of America , CIO , said the President 's decision was contrary to what consumers and workers had been hoping for and would result in prices so high " working people will not be able to buy meat anyway . " Called " Only Solution " Mr. Guckenberger said : " To us it seems the only possible solution to the whole meat situation . For about four years now the Government has tried to have price controls on meat and it has never been enforceable . Over the long run I do n't think the consumer will pay any more for meat , because what they were paying in the black market was certainly out of this world . " Prices will be above the fictitious ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they will level off shortly as they had begun to do last August before controls were reimposed . " Mr. D'Agostino estimated it would require three weeks for meat to reappear in shops and added : " It 's too darn bad the President waited . for meat lines and meat famine to take place before he decided to take controls off . " He predicted that prices would rise only temporarily , declaring : " The process will be the same as when price controls went off last summer . At first they will go up , but after four . or five weeks they will begin to find their own level . They were beginning to go down in August when controls were reapplied . The black market will definitely go out of the picture . " Sees Public " Let Down " Mrs. Gutwillig issued the following statement : " All the low and middle-income groups who looked to the Administration for protection in this time of rising prices have been completely let down by the President 's decision to decontrol meat . " We were told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plentiful and the prices reasonable . At that point butter jumped from 64 cents to a dollar a pound and milk went from 15 to 20 cents a quart . The same thing will happen with meat , only in a more aggravated form , because during the strange interlude between the first and second OPA bills the overslaughtering used up a great deal more meat than was customary for the months of July and August . " " It is unbelievable that the President should take such action as this , " Mr. Stern said . " There is no reason for decontrolling livestock when there is so much in the country and all we need ' to do is see that the Government takes a hand in moving it to the slaughter houses . Decontrol will not make any difference , except to let prices go sky high , and working people will not be able to buy any meat anyway . " Removal of controls will bring supplies.to the city within the next ten days , Jack Kranis , president of National Meat Industries Council , representing dealers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said last night . Praising President Truman 's program , Mr. Kranis pledged the meat industry of no city to a policy of seeking to keep . prices down and to restore conditions such as existed before the war . Plans have been made to form a labor-management committee in the industry to work for stabilization and to receive complaints of exorbitant prices , he said . Joseph Cohn , counsel for the Meat Trade Institute and the New York Council of Wholesale Meat Dealers , said : " We heartily endorse the step taken by the President as announced in his speech tonight . For a short while the prices may be somewhat higher , but within a few weeks they will level off to a very reasonable level , even lower than ceiling prices would be by 1947 , under present law . " Mrs. Francis Schulman , controller of the Fort Greene Retail Meat Market , Inc. , 174 Fort Greene Place , Brooklyn , said on learning of the removal of price controls : " We will continue ? to sell the present stock at under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us which was under the ceilings . We will not take advantage of the removal of ceilings , but hereafter any price increases will merely reflect any increased cost to us . " Regretting that President Truman " has been forced to accede to the economic and politicaliblackmail of a reactionary coalition , " Jack Kroll , director for Congress of Industrial Organizations-Political Action Committee , declared last night that the President " has correctly assessed the responsibility for present shortages  --  on those special interests who care nothing about the welfare of millions of Americans and who are determined to wreck Franklin D. Roosevelt 's program . " " The President , " said Mr. Kroll , " has issued a challenge to the Republican party dominated by the meat trust and other profiteers . It is clear that whatever meat does come to the American dinner table will be at higher prices , above the range of the average wageearning American , and will additionally impair the nation 's economic structure . " What Housewives Thought . Comment by housewives was varied . " Well , I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in Jackson Heights whose reaction was typical . " I think it will probably bring more meat to the markets in a week or . so . But I 'm awfully afraid that prices are going to go sky-high . " A mother of five in Brooklyn commented : " I think there should be some kind of controls on meat . But my husband , who does n't do any shopping , does n't agree with me . " Other opinions were : " I do n't think he could do anything else . I think we 'll be able to get meat now . I do n't believe prices will go sky high  --  or if they do , they 'll eventually readjust themselves . I 'm pleased . - I do n't believe I 'll have to stand hours on a line any longer . " " I do n't really know what to say . I do n't think I could predict what 's going to happen . It 's very problematical . It may be goad . Things may get better . But I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never did agree with the OPA , anyway . Yes , I 'm very glad . Oh , I believe that prices may go higher for a time , but I 'm sure they 'll come down eventually . " " What can I say ? I suppose prices may go very high for a while . But who really knows ? The President has asked those in control not to let that happen . " " I really could n't understand it . I only tuned in in the middle of the broadcast , and that may be the reason . But I confess I did n't quite know what he was talking about . I 'm going to listen to the re-broadcast and try to figure it all out . " " I am relieved about it . Now we will have something to choose from instead of having to take what was there . The people themselves will take care of reducing prices . " " I was in favor of doing away with price control . Prices will be higher for a time , but will level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without standing in line . " " I am sorry for Mr. Truman . He should have put on stricter controls . Now we have inflation for sure . " Calls It Wise Decision " The President made a wise decision . Things will start back to normal after a short time . " ? " From the little I heard of it , it was very good . " " Under present conditions people with connections were able to get meat . Now I can get meat for myself and my family . " A Flatbush housewife said : " We felt a little more satisfied , but did n't know too much more whin it the speech was over . It still looks as though we 'll have a long time to wait for meat . " " You should live so long , " a neighbor chimed in . " I suppose the prices will be awful , but at least we will be able to get meat . We 're still wondering where we are going to get it for the next month or two , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least there is a chance of getting meat some time . We may have to wait , but we 'll get it eventually . It sounded as though at least something is being done . " " The President 's speech on the present meat situation was a political speech intended to prolong the life of the OPA and retain price control , " was one viewpoint . In contrast another housewife said : " I thought it was a pretty good political speech . " Frank Migliaccio , a taxicab driver , who lives at 77-18 Eighteenth Avenue , Brooklyn , and who has a wife and two children , commented on the President 's action : " I have n't had any meat in three months . I live next door to a butcher shop and the owner is a friend of mine . When he gets meat he rings my bell and asks me if I want any , but when I go down I ca n't afford to pay the prices . " John Lins , 36 West Fifty-ninth Street , telephoned THE NEW YORK TIMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It 's a splash in the face of the common people . " A cowgirl at the Rodeo in Madison Square Garden , who is from Texas , said she Owned a ranch " and at home there was no difficulty getting meat , but I 've had little meat since coming to New York ! ' so this sounds like a smart move by President Truman , though I 'm not up on politics . "
