They will dip into the goldfish bowl for the third time in Washington this week . They will fish out , one by one , 8,000 to 9,000 capsules , containing the numbers that will determine the order of induction into the U.S. Army of the 9,000,000 men who signed up in the Third Registration . Early numbers will mean a call to arms some time in June . Meanwhile the Army will pick &; choose from among the 17,500,000 registrants of 1940-41 . Last week many a registrant , teetering uneasily between mufti and khaki , was confused about the future . <P> Was the Army going to draft men with dependents ? Did a notice to report for an Army medical examination mean induction forthwith ? Was the Army planning to call men by age groups rather than by number ? Had the Army reduced its training period to a matter of eight brisk weeks ? <P> From Selective Service bigwigs came reams of explanations that could be threshed down into a few hard facts : <P> &gt;The Army did not want men with dependents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who acquired a wife before Pearl Harbor was reasonably certain of being deferred , provided that he did n't marry her to duck the draft . But if his wife was a working girl , or being supported by rich relatives , he was due to be inducted . <P> &gt; For those in Class 3-A ( dependent-deferred ) who want to serve but ca n't support their families on $21 a month , the Army offered a way out : Any 3-A-men , sound of wind &; limb , with a high-school education , may volunteer for officer training . If accepted , they will get four months ' training in the ranks , either wind up successfully in officer 's training school with subsequent commissions as second lieutenants ( $125 a month ) or return home unsuccessfully as Enlisted Reserves , possibly to be called up later as privates if the 3-As are tapped . Of the million men of 1-A caliber now on the lists as dependent-deferred , about 150,000 are eligible for officer training . The Army needs 75,000 new officers this year for ground forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ranks . <P> &gt; An Army medical test , successfully passed , now means immediate induction , with immediate furloughs available for draftees who just have to straighten out their civilian affairs . The Army 's speed in grabbing manpower does not please the Navy . Determined to man ships with volunteers , the Navy formerly got quite a few youngsters who had passed the Army test , changed over to the Navy before induction . Although the Navy has had more than 140,000 volunteers since Pearl Harbor , it needs a minimum of 45,000 enlistments monthly . Last week the Navy sent out a press release , thoughtfully reminding draftees that a call for Army medical examination did n't mean that they simply had to join the Army ; the Navy was open . <P> &gt;The widespread notion that the Army had adopted the European system of calling men up by age groups rather than by number was spiked last week by War Secretary Stimson . The lottery system still prevails . If the Army wants a new batch of soldiers , they will be gathered from the rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them in each pool , and low-number men will be the first selected .
