txt GERMANS PREPARE MILITARY ATTACK Next Offensive Will Be One of War , Not Peace , Foreign Office Announces By OTTO D. TOLISCHUS Wireless to THE NEW YORK TIMES . BERLIN , Jan. ** next German offensive will be a military not a peace offensive , according to pronouncements from the Foreign Office today . Irritated by reports in the British , French and American press that Germany is seeking an early peace by compromise , the Wilhelmstrasse , through the semi-official Dienst aus Deutschland , issued a categoric denial of these reports . It further denounced them as " British propaganda manoeuvres . " Dienst aus Deutschland denies in particular reports that Germany has called a conference of all her Ambassadors and Ministers in Berlin to prepare a new peace step , that she is talking peace with neutral powers , especially Premier Mussolini but also the Vatican , and that Signor Mussolini addressed a peace message to Chancellor Hitler . It then concludes : " After the unequivocal declarations by German statesmen , there can not be any doubt regarding the German determination to seek a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view is taken by the entire German press , by local National Socialist leaders in their New Year 's messages and is reaffirmed today by Minister of Economics Walther Funk in a speech in Salzburg . He outlined Germany 's economic preparations for war and then declared : " Germany was forced into war and this war will be waged by her with all hardness and determination . " War of Principles Dr. Funk , who has been relieved of his functions as Commissioner General for Economy , which were transferred to the economic general staff of ten under Field Mari shal Hermann Goering , but who remains Economics Minister and Reichsbank President , repeated the German thesis that he had previously outlined . This is that the war is a war between " two principles of life  --  between the international capitalistic principle , which // GERMANS PREPARE MILITARY ATTACK // is based on the international money community whose main defender is the English plutocracy with its claim to world rule , and National Socialist Weltanschauung world outlook , which is based on the national peoples community as developed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he insisted that the ruling caste of Great Britain was waging war against " German socialism , which dared to make itself independent of the international money powers and raw material monopolies , and against the new social order created by National Socialism , which gives the German worker a greater share in the goods of life and its cultural works than anywhere else in the world . " In view of the growing shortage of all the " goods of life , " to which now is added a serious coal shortage that coincides with the arrival of a cold wave , this pronouncement is likely to meet with some scepticism . Moreover , since in his New Year proclamation Herr Hitler announced as one German war aim the creation of a " new Europe , " Herr Funk 's purely defensive thesis is no longer complete . In that respect Dr. Hans Frank , Governor General of the Polish " gouvernement general , " who is applying the rule of the German master race in Poland , is considerably franker . In his New Year 's proclamation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins for the German people and the German Reich the great mission of gigantic increase in racial accomplishment and creation of a world empire of the German nation . We Germans have become conscious as decisive molders of European and therewith of world kultur . " Even a moderate newspaper like the Frankfurter Zeitung , which is now the mouthpiece of the military rather than the Foreign Office and which , in line with military views , suggests to the Western Powers that a strong Germany is necessary as a bulwark against Bolshevist Russia , nevertheless also declares the supremacy of the Western Powers must be broken and that Germany knows only one alternative , " victory or chaos . " According to Dr. Funk , Britain 's attempt to force Germany to her knees by economic warfare " will fail this time , " no matter how brutally Britain seeks to make neutrals her slaves or however much she attempts to buy up all raw materials at the expense of neutrals . He asserts German export trade with the North , East and Southeast , especially the rich Soviet-Russian domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , will defeat all these efforts . " I can assure you , " he said , " that our economic armament is not inferior to our military strength . " At the same time he stressed the exigencies of war that necessitate curtailments in private production and private consumption . In this connection he castigated hoarders who , he said , are buying up not only food but also bathtubs and such things , which they can neither eat nor use to pay taxes or the doctor . But by and large he emphasized that the German people retained confidence in German currency and in German State leadership . " The National Socialist Government declines to cover war costs by means of the printing press , " he declared . At the same time , without going into details , he forecast new financial measures in the general direction of more taxes and increased popular savings as a basis for war credits , either to be furthered by rewards or compelled by taxation . A sort of compulsory saving already is in force in Germany through the rationing system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in as much as some people still are trying to invest any ready cash in whatever " substance values " are available , even if merely bathtubs , Dr. Funk suggests a special kind of war saving , for which financial writers discuss many methods . The one most favored seems to be a lottery that would give the lucky holders of savings accounts , in addition to regular interest , additional premiums in either money or perhaps consumption goods in somewhat the same way as additional food rations are doled out for hard manual labor or overtime . As regards taxes , Dr. Funk insisted : " We have no desire , even in wartime , to establish a state economy . We want to maintain an entrepreneur economy directed by the State . For that reason we must prevent the stimulus for increased production from being killed by taxes or taxes being screwed so high that they touch fixed costs , entailing general economic damage . " According to rumors , the new taxes , besides bringing a new boost in the income tax , will concentrate on further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving . One rumor predicts a 40 per cent sales tax on all still unrationed goods .
