txt Independence Day Greeting Cabled by a Russian Actor To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORE : TIMES : Permit me , a Russian actor who has linked his fate with the Moscow Art Theatre , to send through your paper greetings to the American intelligentsia on the occasion of the American people 's national holiday . Our common struggle against Nazi barbarians is a pledge of the early triumph of light over darkness . The Russian people have made many sacrifices in this struggle and know that there is only one road  --  the road of struggle until we achieve victory . We are accustomed to appreciate the energy of the American people and are firmly convinced that their efforts coupled with the struggle waged by the Russian people will wipe out the infamy whose name is Hitlerism . VASSILI KACHALOV , People 's Artist , U.S.S.R. Moscow , July 3 , 1943.
