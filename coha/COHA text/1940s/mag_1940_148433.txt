Nearly all the popular music heard over the air is controlled by American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers ( ASCAP ) , a composer 's union which collects royalties on every musical broadcast . Last spring Montana broadcasters got so fed up they had a law passed outlawing ASCAP 's royalties . When ASCAP insisted on royalty payments , one broadcaster filed charges of extortion . Montana authorities then tried to arrest ASCAP 's genial President Gene Buck . <P> Last week he got too close . In Phoenix , Ariz. , the warrant servers nabbed him . Said vexed Mr. Buck : " You 'd think I was John Dillinger. "
