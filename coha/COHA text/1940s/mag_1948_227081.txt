Two facts which had been almost completely overlooked before the election now stood out like very sore thumbs : 1 ) labor voted in droves against the Taft-Hartley law and worked quietly but feverishly to sell the Democratic ticket to everyone in sight ; 2 ) many farmers , who had been expected to vote Republican as usual , voted for Harry Truman instead . Between them they caught the Republicans in an implacable crossfire . <P> Side by Side . There was no doubt about labor 's part . Its politicos worked quietly , kept their names out of the papers , deliberately played down their activity for fear of antagonizing non-labor votes . But labor was united for common action as seldom before . Said one Illinois organizer : " In 1944 we made a lotta noise . In ' 48 we worked . " <P> In every big industrial state , labor organized down to the ward and precinct level . The A.F.L. and President A. F. Whitney 's Railroad Trainmen worked side by side with the lieutenants of C.I.O. 's Jack Kroll ( who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They combed registration lists , personally called on unregistered voters . <P> As the campaign got under way , labor punched doorbells , manned sound-trucks , flooded the country with campaign literature . In Chicago alone , labor mustered nearly 10,000 volunteer workers . Many a worker in Democratic headquarters had his salary paid by labor . On Election Day labor provided free babysitters , free taxi service and piled up Democratic pluralities . <P> Angry Mutterings . Farmers had no such specific target as the Taft-Hartley law . But they had been muttering angrily ever since Congress refused to grant appropriations to the Commodity Credit Corp . last summer for more crop storage bins . Because no Government loans can be made on crops stored on the farm , they had been forced to dump their surplus on a falling market . <P> In case any farmers missed the point , Harry Truman blamed the G.O.P. directly when the price of Illinois corn dropped from $2.29 to 96 a bushel in September . Ahead of and behind the President , Agriculture Secretary Charles Brannan also roamed the Midwest , hammering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , failed to give any specific assurances on the future of price supports . Besides , many farmers just liked the prosperity they had gained in Democratic years. * <P> Thus , on Election Day , thousands of farmers decided either to vote Democratic or to stay home . In the normally Republican counties of rural Illinois , the vote fell 150,000 below 1944 , 400,000 below 1940 . In Indiana , rural returns almost upset Dewey 's earlier lead . In Iowa , the farmers assured Harry Truman 's victory . <P> Distrust &; Revolt . Obviously labor and the farmers were not enough to turn the trick alone . There were other important factors : <P> The bandwagon pressure of the public-opinion polls , which encouraged many waverers to vote for Underdog Truman just to slow up the expected Dewey landslide , and caused many overconfident Republicans to stay away from the polls entirely . <P> The impact of the candidates themselves , which stirred many to vote for Harry Truman 's fighting campaign , and sent others to the polls in revolt against the lofty Dewey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which gave Harry Truman a boost in almost every key state .
