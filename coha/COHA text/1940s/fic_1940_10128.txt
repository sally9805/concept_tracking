And he 'd seen them bring in good sized fish too , river bass occasionally , weakfish , cod and eels . Gurlie had been deeply interested once when a woman living near her had spoken of skinning an eel and binding it about her knee for rheumatism . As in the case of the East Side Settlement , the Stechers had gone to the fishing club once , on Decoration Day , to a jamboree , a big kettle , set into the broad brick fireplace , steamingwith clam chowder  --  the children spreading tomatocatsup on Pilot biscuits till it ran down the front of their dresses . An apron and necktie party  --  No , they were too nervous , too shy  --  too prone to find fault . Gurlie would roar afterward . " Huh ! When I think of the kitchen at Sonderheim and those beautiful things hundreds of years old , the silver and the copper kettles , the chairs and the tables cut from the finest wood ! What do they think they know in this country ? " But the scandals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a head , often making the headlines in the morning papers . Joe had been deeply perturbed . " The whole Money Order Bureau is rottenthrough and through , " said he when he had come in several evenings later showing signs of more than usual fatigue and discouragement . " Thank God at least for Payne . We 'd be lost without him . If he dies . . . " " Why , is he sick ? " " Yes . I wish I were through with the whole Goddamnmess and had a job printing labels for patent medicine bottles . " " Nonsense ! " said Gurlie laughing  --  her favoritep101word . " You 'll win . I know it . I have a lucky hand . You wait and see . " " Wait ? " said Joe . " I 've been waiting all summer and now I 've got to wait till they clean up the whole Department before I can make a living . " Certainly a doubt had arisen . Even the President of the United States might finally become involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the only one who can cut the red tape and decide it . " Joe expected a call any day from Washington now since pressure , great pressure , was being exerted to take the job away from him as an irresponsible agent  --  without even a shop of his own  --  and return it to the Mohawk Press as the best ones to handle it even though they were the highest bidders . " They ca n't do that , " said Gurlie . " How can they do such a thing ? " " Suppose they shoot me some night . I suppose the bullet would n't go through my guts because I 'm such a thoroughly reliable person , " said Joe . " But you are the one who built up that whole business for them . They 're crooks . " " That 's what they 're trying to prove that I am , " said her husband . " You ? You a crook ? " She roared . " You 're pretty smart but you 're not smart enough for that , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goods on them I could n't have got a smell of the job , no matter who I was . And I would have come out of it dirtier than the dirtiest thief you 'd meet on the street any day of your life . Ruined . May be yet . I do n't know . " " You 're just scared , that 's all . You have no courage . Fight them . Be a politician . "  |p102In  and out , in and out . Another day and here was Joe home again in mid-afternoon , his face flushed , his eye blazing . " They kicked him out ! " said he jubilantly as he entered the door . " Who ? " " Caldwell . " " Hooray ! Who told you ? " " It 's in the afternoon papers . Here . I 'm going to take a bath . Where are the children ? " " I sent them across the street to play . Give it to me . " " This looks like what I 've been waiting for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper to the window and started to read . But he came back in a moment and took it out of her hand . " Look here , " he said . " They took action against him . Now we 'll go ahead . " He sat down in another chair with the paper whileGurlie laid her hands in her lap waiting . " I thought you were going to take a bath . " " That 's right , " said her husband . " Wait a minute . " " I 'll see if there 's any hot water . " Joe continued reading his paper until his wife came back from the kitchen . " Well , " she said standing there , " are you going to take a bath or not ? I want the paper . " " That 's right , " he said without looking up . " Get out of there ! " She jerked the paper from his hand . " I 'm sick and tired of this . " Joe leaned back and laughed at her . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then we 'll see . It looks good . " " That 's fine . You make me tired , " she answeredp103him . " I ca n't do anything . Hurry up now before the children come back . " So he went in and turned on the water as Gurlie sat herself near the window once more to read . Sure enough , there it was . Caldwell had been removed from office as Director of the Money Order Department because of irregularities , or attempted irregularities , in his handling of the recent bids for printing the Money Order blanks . Gurlie read it over and over . Joe 's name was mentioned several times . It appeared that he , Caldwell , had tried to induce Stecher to relinquish his successful bid for the four year contract and to make peace with the Mohawk Press  --  at an estimated cost to the Government of so many thousand dollars a year additional . But Stecher had refused point blank , etc. , etc . " What do you think of that ? " was all she could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got out of the tub , he heard the children prattlingaround the house again and Gurlie 's voice tellingthem to go on and play and leave her alone . " I want to take a bath too , " Lottie was saying when he came into the front room , barefooted and in his pants and undershirt , his hair standing out at all angles . " Good Lord , " said Gurlie , " I thought I was going to get a few moments peace . This place will drive me crazy . What good are you all ? " " Forget it , " said Joe . " I 'll amuse them . Read your paper . " " I wan na take a bath , " said Lottie . The baby was standing by a chair and said the same thing  --  more or less . " No , " said Joe . " Not today . Your mother is tired . " " It 's a hot day , " said Gurlie . " Why do n't you give them a bath yourself if you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They need a bath . Give it to them , they 're your children as much as they are mine . " " I never gave a child a bath in my life , " said Joe . " Well , do n't bother me , " said his wife , " that 's all I care . Lottie can bathe herself . Put some water in the tub . Heat some more water in the kitchen and fix it up for her . Go on . " She turned again to her paper . " Can I bathe them both at the same time ? " said Joe . " Yes , " said Gurlie . Joe was the methodical craftsman if there ever was one so he went at his job with forethought , planning each step carefully . But he got into a great argument at once with Lottie who had already begun to drop her clothes all over the room , before he could get back from the kitchen with the warm water . Besides he had n't cleaned up after himself yet and everything was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lottie did most of her own work and was soon running around naked so Joe undressed the baby , who was wet , and finally with a deep frown carried her into the bathroom and plunked both the kids down in the tub . He fished out two cloths and some soap and  --  " Where do you begin ? " he called back to his wife . " Shall I wash their heads ? " Gurlie did n't even answer him . He gave both the children a good , thorough soaping , sitting on a chair beside them and finally began to laugh to himself in high amusement as the baby sucked on a corner of the cloth he was trying to rinse her off with and looked up at him in unmixed astonishmentat the nasty taste she got . Lottie wanted to soap the baby too . He put a stop to that . He had n't felt so amused and happy in ages . Halfp105laughing at himself , loving his little babies  --  half as if his own mother had gone out and left him , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough job of it and the little girls splashed and had the time of their lives . Sad , somehow . He did n't know why . Little Flossie with her half grown blond hair all out of true and curled up in the center at the back like a drake 's tail , her babyish hands , fingers spread wide , like a frog 's . He helped Lottie out of the tub first , so she would n't slip and fall , keeping his eye on the baby the while  --  and told his older daughter to dry herself . Then he picked up the baby and sitting on the cover of the toilet , he put a towel across his lap and proceeded to dry her . She wanted to stand up and hug him . He had his hands full trying to hold her and dry her and keep her from grabbing his nose at the same time , and when he looked , after a moment , Lottie was gone and was running around naked in the front room . He finished drying the baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held her for a while on his lap . She was interested in his moustache , but he turned his head away . Then she took his face between her two hands and looking up into his eyes said , " Daddy . " He put her over one shoulder but then she discovered his ear into which she poked her sharp little finger time and again . It ended with his putting a coverlet on the floor in the front room and letting the children play on it just as they were . " Do you think they 're going to stay on that ? " said his wife . " Look at Lottie 's feet now . " They were black . " Leave them alone , " said Joe . " This is my job . "  |p106It  was really very stuffy in the room and Joe realized how the children felt . They looked at their mother when she had dropped the paper and spoken , waiting for the inevitable repression , then when nothinghappened and their father just sat there and laughed , they laughed back , knowingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling and turning as if they had been little monkeys . Joe grinned from ear to ear . As inevitably must have happened , Lottie got tired of the blanket and ran off to the kitchen her feet patteringsoftly on the carpet and the boards . Joe let her go . Let them do anything they please , he said to himself , and let 's see what happens . " I see , " said Gurlie reading , " that Mrs. Douglas and daughter have been at Bar Harbor all summer and are leaving for Europe tomorrow . They may return in December . " " When are we sailing ? " said Joe . " I 'm thinking of buying a yacht . " His wife looked over the top of her paper quickly as if she Thought he had gone off his head  --  then realized he was amusing himself and ignored him again . Lottie came back from the kitchen now . " I wish you would bathe us all the time , Daddy . " " Sure I will , " said Joe . " Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and coming toward him . Back went Lottie to the kitchen  --  she was getting to be a big girl now  --  almost ready to go to school  --  a beautiful little thing . Now she was coming back again with  --  some sort of forbidden fruit no doubt.  |p107He  watched her naked coming up the corridor between the rooms . Joe had never really looked at his children like this before , never realized that he , Joe Stecher , possessed  --  if you call it that  --  two such amusing sprouts of feminine exuberance . That 's what it is to have time to yourself . He was tasting a world with which he was not familiar even among his own family . He felt embarrassed and turned to look at Gurlie who was still reading and did n't give a damn . She wanted a boy ! Lottie was very dignified when she walked , very straight , putting her little feet out in front of her one at a time with great assurance . She had a banana in her hand . " Is it all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his wife . " Yes , " said Gurlie without looking up . " Can I sit in your lap , Daddy ? " " No , it 's too hot , " said Joe . So Lottie stood beside him with one hand on the arm of his chair and looked at the baby whose antics were amusing him greatly . There was a heavy upholstered foot-rest which Joe sometimes used evenings when he was reading . This became the baby 's special objective . First she stood up by it , then she pushed it a few inches then she crawled up on top of it and lay on it on her belly as if swimming . Then over it she went slowly head first upon the floor turning over completely without intending to  --  " I can stand on my head , " said Lottie . " Go ahead , " said her father . Of course , she could n't do it but she tried hard and the baby was n't far behind her , putting her headp108down and kicking one foot in the air , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gurlie had been able to nurse Lottie , a prize baby , but the other little cricket was much too skinny . The one striking thing about her was her excitement . She more than Lottie sensed the freedom she was enjoying and the intense expression in her little eyes made up for her limitations . Now she found a paper covered hook that was lying on the floor and started to crawl into a large chair with it . As she just managed to gain the chair seat  --  Lottie wanted to help her but Joe would n't have it  --  the book slid from her grasp and she lost it . Down she came again and holding the book she tried once more to negotiate the climb . Once more the book fell to the floor . So she climbed up anyway without it and sat back in the big chair , one hand on either arm of it , her feet out in front of her , and leaning back smiled at her father . Down she came again almost at once . Perpetual motion . " Pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air at something Joe could n't make out . Then she tried to lift the heavy foot-stool in her arms . " I see Alice Roosevelt wore a grey crepe dress at the Newport Horse Show yesterday . " " Wait till I 'm rich , " said Joe . " I 'll buy dresses so you can change them every hour if you want to . " " Huh ! " said his wife . " You 'd better . " " Come here , Lottie , " he said and this time he did take her into his lap . " Read me a story , Daddy . " " Sure , " said Joe , " a story about a big house and trees and all kinds of flowers and grapes and apples and horses and sheep and pigs  --  millions of pigs . " " What are you talking about ? " said his wife.  | " Well , is n't that what you want ? " he said to her . " A big , big house on a mountain , way up on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish  --  " Gurlie turned away , so Joe went on  --  " big , big fish . And a dog and a cat  --  Way up on a mountainunder the moon  --  And at night the man in the moon will come down a ladder to fish in the lake and we 'll sneak out the back door and grab him ! Grrr ! Quick . Like that and the moon will stop in the sky to wait for him . It 'll stay still in the sky without moving and it will never be morning again until he gives us fifty bags of silver dollars . He 'll have to give it to us or we 'll tie him up in the cellar  --  " " Who , Daddy ! " " The man in the moon . " " What 's that ? " said Gurlie . " What are you telling that child ? " " Go on read your paper . And then , " said Joe , " we 'll go upstairs and we 'll wake Mother and tell her what we have in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon . They 'll look in at the windows  --  and they 'll make a noise like mosquitoes and big flies . But we wo n't let them come in . " " Shall we feed him , Daddy ? " " Oh yes , " said Joe . " We 'll feed him blue milk . Gallonsand gallons of blue milk . And wagons and wagons of it . We 'll buy all the blue milk in the world and feed it to him . Thousands and thousands of quarts and gallons of it . " Crash ! Gurlie dropped her paper . But Joe was laughing his head off . The baby had dragged the cloth off a small table with an ashtray and a flower vase on it  --  but nothing had broken . " You 're crazy , " said his wife.  | " Leave her alone , " said Joe . " I 'll clean it up . I want to see what she 'll do . " " She 'll smash everything in the house . " " What do we care , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang . " What 's that ? Watch the children , " said Joe . " I 'll go and see . " Gurlie leaned out of the window . " It looks like a telegram . I can see the top of the boy 's cap . Did n't I tell you ? " " Ah ha ! " said Joe . That 's what it was . A wire instructinghim to be in Washington in the morning , as early as possible . " I 'll have to leave tonight , " said Joe . Gurlie swept up the children , put their nightgownson , dumped them into their beds for convenience and went into the kitchen to fix supper . The baby stood up at once and started to jabber . Joe got his satchel out of the closet , put it on his bed . He began to throw his things into it . " Are you going away , Daddy ? " said Lottie . " Yes , I 'm going away to Washington , to fight ! " said her father . " What 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 're going to try to prove everything they can against me . Try to beat me out of it  --  by fair means or foul . Their first move did n't work out so now  --  we 'll see what the next is . " " What do you think ? " " They 've got some pretty high-priced lawyers . They may do it . " " Have you got a lawyer ? " " No , not for this . I can beat them myself without help . " " Good for you . I know you can do it , " said his wifep111coming over and kissing him violently on the mouth . " I know you can beat them . Nobody can beat you  --  " " Oh yes . A liar can beat me , " said Joe . " If he has luck and enough friends in the government . " " There 's no hurry , is there ? " said Gurlie . " No , no . " " You can leave on the Owl , at midnight . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to know . " When supper was over , the children were in their beds and Gurlie was straightening up the kitchen , Joe walked to the front windows of the flat as was his custom very often and looked out into the street . A man like himself was leaning on a sill opposite , puffing a pipe and blowing the smoke out before him contentedly . " How do I know he 's contented ? " Joe asked himself . " Maybe he 's worse off than I am , much worse . " In one of the windows of the floor above the man as he leaned there , the figure of a woman combingher hair was outlined on the lighted window shade . Gurlie called to her husband from inside . " Do you want a glass of beer , yah ? " He did n't hear her at first . " What are you doing there ? Do you want beer ? " " Yah , all right . " It was one of those steamy nights so familiar about New York in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the streets under the arc lights here and there seem a vast shut in theatre . There was no sound of traffic except the occasional rumble of the L at the intersection of 9th Ave. , and the children 's voices below were unusually distinct . A small family group across from him caught Joe 's eye . This must be what that other fellow is looking at too , thought Joe . There were ten or twelve of them on the brown stone steps opposite , hatless , the men in their shirt sleeves  --  smaller children riding the stone railings watching a little sidewalk show before them . A boy of fifteen or so was doing a buck and wing dance to some tune Joe did not recognize played on the harmonica . The boy quit , wiped his brow grotesquely with his hand and collapsed , or pretended to , beside his accompanist while the little crowd applauded . And now , in the complete silence of the street , a small girl walked before the audience and began to sing . Every word was distinct as Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Come on , " said Gurlie behind him . " What are you looking at out there ? " She dragged him by the shoulder into the hot room . It looked good as they sat down at the bare dining room table . Joe took up a cold bottle , snapped the patent stopper back and filled a small stein  --  Gurlie had produced two of them , plain grey with a blue circle one half inch down from the top . He poured another for himself and immediately buried his moustache down in it . " Agh , that 's better , " he said . Gurlie spread some cheese on two crackers for him as he leaned back in his chair . " When I look at these big business men , " he said to her after a moment , " and listen how they talk I often say to myself , Huh , have you got any brains ? ' Sometimes it 's hard to believe . " " They do n't know anything , " said his wife , " compared to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , they do , " said he . " They know lots . They know their business . But I wonder often if that is n't all they do know . Dumm ! "  |p113he  said it in German and tapped his forehead . " They ai n't got no culture , " he added smiling , " and they do n't want none . " It sounded funny as with his slight , very slight , German accent he attempted to imitate the speech of the day . " Well , go ahead , " said his wife . " Go ahead with what ? " " You said you were going to tell me what 's happeningnow . " " Well , the only reason I ever bid on the God damn contract was because I had an idea there were a couple of honest men in there who would know what it was all about . But maybe now they 'll call it quits , consider they 've punished Caldwell enough , and give the contract back to the old company after all . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe . " Why not ? It 's a free country . " " Do n't talk to me , " said his wife . " And if you do n't get the contract after all ? Then what ? " " We 'll go back to Buffalo , "  --  where they had lived formerly . " No , " said Gurlie . " Never . I 'm going to stay right here . Put ' em in jail if you have to . " " Yah , if they 're crooked put ' em in jail ' ! Put ' em all in jail ! Me Hercules , with a wife and two children to support . Put ' em in jail ! " " You can do it . I wo n't let you make fun of yourself . I do n't like you when you talk that way . You 're not funny . You 've got too much brains for that . " Sadly enough Joe knew it well . He could n't be funny no matter how he tried . " Yah , yah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Gurlie fetching the paper . " I want to go to the theatre . I 'm not going to stay here without any fun just because the government can't make up its mind . Look . We 've got to vaccinate the children . I 've got to have some clothes . I ca n't just sit here like this waiting the rest of my life . You get that contract . " " No , " said Joe shaking his head . " We 'll have to wait till after we see what 's going to happen to us first . Then we 'll know . " " Agh , you make me sick , " said Gurlie . Joe got up and walked slowly into the bedroom looking at his watch . " Ten o'clock , well I guess I better be going . " From his top bureau drawer he took a 36 caliber Smith &; Wesson revolver , unlimbered it , sighted through the barrel and without loading it , dropped it into his satchel among the other things . " What 's that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She reached into the bag , took the revolver out , holding it in her hand and looked at him . " They 've been following me around all summer , " he told her . " Why did n't you tell me ? " " If anything happens , you 'll find out about it from the papers . Nothing 's going to happen . " Gurlie put the revolver down on the bed and went back to her work . " Yah , " she said as she left the room . " Nothing 's going to happen . "  |p115JOE  WAS STILL in Washington , late in September , a day such as one in perfect truth dreams of . As Gurlie stood at the front window hearing the postman 's whistle she could both see it and breathe it . It had been hot and muggy nearly the whole week previous but today , Monday , the sky was crystal clear . The air was moving , one felt it even in the house , clearheaded and ready to go places . She watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps of the apartment , his bag slung from one shoulder , and went down at once to see if he had left anything for her . Yes , there was a letter . It was from Joe . She stood a moment on the stone porch to breathe the air . As she mounted the stairs again she looked at the emblem on the envelope . She saw , The Raleigh , curved like a rainbow above , prominently , with flourishes of the engraver 's tool making tapered eyebrows and curlicues about it . Underthat was a boar 's head  --  or was it the head of a wolf ?  --  upright as if severed and placed on a dish , no neck , merely the ears and a ruff . Under that , horizontal , a bar , some heraldic symbol of two shades , white and grey like a stick of candy or a barber 's pole . Under that again the shield , quite plain , with gouttes or gules falling diagonally down across to the right  - -  That must be the Raleigh coat of arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Absolutely fireproof . That must1p116mean it is n't really . T. J. Talty , Manager . What kind of name is that ? Sounds French . Washington , D. C. , it read at the top of the letter , August 25 , 1903 , Joe had filled in the 3 . Dear Gurlie , I had conferences today with the First Assistant Postmaster General and the Ass't Attorney General . The lawyer of W  --  has sent in his papers , and some were gone over today by the Ass't Attorney General . I was permitted to read these papers and had an opportunity to deny several assertions . I was assured today by the above officials that the Government wants me to have the contract , and that the award would be made officially in a few days . This is all very encouraging , but the following is bad . I received a telegram from my backers that their names have become known . I have no idea how it could have become known and have telegraphed for further information . I hope this will not be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it would of course make greater difficulties for me to overcome . Be careful not to say a word to anyone . Yours lovingly , Joe . Greater difficulties to overcome . She read that over again . " Fine ! " she said . " Mammie ! " said the older daughter . " Can we go out ? " The baby was in her new creeping chair bangingdown the hall to the kitchen in her usual wild ,  |p117staggering  canter . " Yes , " said Gurlie , " I 'll take you out pretty soon . " She picked up the morning paper that Joe was havingsent up these days so Gurlie could follow the official progress as his case developed . Sure enough the Herald had a quarter column of it on the third page . She cut it out with the big shears , drew the paste pot from far back in the desk , took the big pale blue scrap book  --  with the words Scrap Book broadly displayedon the front  --  and pasted in her clipping . There . Several formless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the page . When she got to the park with the children , Lottie walking and Flossie in her carriage , Gurlie continued idling along in the brilliant sunlight thinking to herselfof the present and the future . Squirrels frisked about here and there and fat pigeons walked ahead of the carriage , zigzagging right and left , glancing back or pecking quickly at invisible crumbs about them . Gurlie did n't even see them , almost running them down now with the baby carriage wheels so tame they were . Lottie would stop , holding her breath , as a pigeon just moved enough sometimes for the carriage to pass . Then breathing again the child would resume her walk , catching up the step or two she had lost to her mother 's side as they went along . You could n't push them out of the way they were so fat , cozy and secure there . It was very lovely in that part of the park with rollingrocky land and a small stream that always made Gurlie think of the days before there was ever a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indianslived undisturbed . She came out of that soon ,  |p118|preferring  the sun in her face as she started southwardtoward the reservoir . Now there were many sunny bays and well kept patches of fresh grass along the winding path as she kept sauntering further . At one of these where there were two benches she stopped to rest . She was very warm from walking . Flossie was clamoring to get down so Gurlie spread a small blanket on the grass and let her sit on it . The ground was warm and dry when she put her hand down to feel it . " Can I walk on the grass ? " asked Lottie . " Yes , " said Gurlie , " as much as you like . " Finding it even drier than she had expected and quite comfortable , Gurlie herself sat on the grass along with the children where there was a patch of clover and began to go over it carefully looking for four leafed ones . " What are you looking for , Mammie ? " " Oh go on and play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to wander off . " Look ! " said a little girl who was passing with an older woman . " You can go on the grass . " " No , " said the woman , " I told you no . It 's damp there and you 'll catch cold . " Gurlie did n't hear them . The little girl began to cry . " Mama , " she called back over her shoulder . " I wan na play on the grass like them , " pointing , " and Nana wo n't let me . " Gurlie looked up and saw the child with what appeared to be her grandmother while a few paces back a younger woman , probably the mother , was coming along up the little hill pushing a very heavy English baby coach with exaggerated effort . " Ugh ! " she said , wobbling her shoulders heavily . " Let 's sit down here . " " No , " said the older woman , " not here . " With that the younger woman turned her carriage crosswisep119with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go no further . The older woman stood a moment then sat down also . Gurlie twenty feet away with her back to them continued minding her own business . Three pigeons settled to the walk near the newcomers and the little girl was at once attracted . " I wan na peanut to feed the birdies . " She began to burrow with her hand at the foot of the carriage . " All right , all right , " said her mother . " Keep your hands out of there . You might be sorry . " The lady who was rather fat and slow in her movementstook a few peanuts from a paper bag into her lap and cracked the shells . The little girl took one of the nuts before it was cracked and threw it violently at the birds who hopped a few feet away from her , went to the nut , eyed it and came back to the bench . " You see , " said the woman to the little girl , " that 's what you get for being in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hold out your hand to them "  --  but the little girl was afraid . Gurlie could hear them but she did not turn round . " Oh look ! " said the woman to the old lady beside her . " Is n't that a cute baby ? Look at it trying to walk . Ooops ! there it goes . " And indeed little Flossie did go down hard on her bottom trying to come toward the bench whence the new excitement was emanating . She crawled along now a few feet then sat hack and grinned at the newcomers . " I wan na play with the baby , " said the little girl . " No , " said the older woman . " I do n't want you to go on the grass . " The child looked at her mother then put one little foot on the grass and turned sideways go look at her grandmother who got up and grabbing her roughly by the arm jerked her back and shook her finger in her face . " No ! I said , No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Leave the child alone . " " Leave her alone , yes . If she has croup again tonightthen who will be to blame ? Then I 'll leave her alone . Come on . I want to go . " " Not yet , " said her daughter . " I 'm tired . " Now the little girl saw Lottie and walked along the asphalt walk until she was opposite her . There she stood and smiled putting her head sidewise and twisting her body a little sharply so that her little skirts rocked around her with a swish . Then her face got serious . Then she smiled a big smile but she did n't dare go on the grass to her new found friend . The lady took her baby out of the heavy carriage and held it on her lap . It was quite a small baby and very sleepy , not more than seven or eight months old . She was arguing with the older woman who finally shrugged her shoulders and turned away . The young woman as Gurlie had done before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid her baby on it while she herself sat on a corner of it . She seemed greatly amused at Flossie 's gyrations . " Oh , " she said after a moment , " Pthuh ! No , no , no ! Look , lady , " she said to Gurlie . " Look what your child 's doing . " Gurlie looked . Flossie was sitting on the grass with her back to her mother perfectly quiet . " Look ! " said the woman . " She 's eating something . It 's a peanut I think . " Gurlie called to her infant . " Spit it out . She 's all right , " she said to the woman . " It wo n't hurt her . " The woman was scandalized . " Oh I 'd be frightened , " she said . " It might be ap121worm . " Gurlie laughed but she got up and went to Flossie leaning down over her . " Nasty , " she said and she put her finger in the baby 's mouth . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she chewed . " Come here , " said Gurlie and she put her back on the blanket . " Now stay there . " A great screaming and whacking went up at this from the other end of the little grass plot . The grandmother had the little girl and was shaking her as a terrier shakes a pillow . " Did n't I tell you not to go on the grass . You 're the most disobedient child I have ever seen . Sit down there , " and she plunked her on the bench where the child sobbed , looking toward Lottie in great shame and misery . After a moment the old woman took the child by the wrist and walked off down the path . " I 'm not staying here , " she said to her daughter . " I 'm going home . " " Leave Sarah , " the younger woman said . " I want her with me . " So the older woman went off down the path alone . The young woman shook her head as Gurlie looked up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it awful ? Come here , " she said to her child . " Come here . Blow ! " She wiped her daughter 's little face . " So . Now run and play with the little girl . But do n't run away . And do n't sit on the grass . Remember . " The child was shy now and did n't want to go . But she went slowly just the same . " It 's awful , " said the woman in the general direction in which Gurlie was sitting . " Old people get to he such fools . They forget that the world is changing . Look at that ! " she added suddenly . " Quick ! " Flossie was struggling and shaking her head , pinchingup her eyes and opening her mouth as wide as she could . What a face ! " What in the world has she got ? " said the woman who had run to her . " It 's a cigarette ! " Sure enough Flossie had found a cigarette butt in the grass and had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn , " said Gurlie . " But she 's too little , she do n't know . " " Let her learn then , " said Gurlie . " If she does n't like it she can spit it out . " " But look , " said the woman . " A cigarette butt . Somebody else has been sucking it . It 's dirty . It 'll poison her . " " She should n't eat it then , " said Gurlie . The woman looked at her . " I 'd be afraid . " " Where are those children ? " " Leave them alone , " said Gurlie . As a matter of fact the two older girls had merely stepped in among some low spruce branches where there was a carpet of red needles covering the dry ground . The little girls were busy gathering handfuls of the stuff and bringing it out through the low branches gingerly to make a little heap of it on the grass beyond . " Do you have your mother living with you ? " said the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where is she going ? " " Oh she 'll come back , " said the woman . " She alwaysdoes that . That 's an awfully cute little girl you have . Have you any other children ? " " No , " said Gurlie . " Is that a boy ? " " Yes , " said the woman as if apologetically . " Boys are so different . Look how he 's sleeping . Ai n't that cute . I love to look at them when they 're sleeping . But he can be a devil . She always picks him up . When my husband 's home he lets her do it . At home I 'm the only one that lets him cry . " Two small boys broke through the trees wherep125moment , looked down at her smiling . " Dada , " she said . " Bring her here , " said Gurlie to the woman . " Shoe , " said the baby looking at the man 's feet . " She 's got something in her mouth again , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't want to take it out . You better do it . " " Give her to me , " said Gurlie . " Spit it out . " The baby only closed her mouth the harder and bowing her head a little looked up at her mother with reluctanteyes . Gurlie put her finger into the baby 's mouth and fished around in her cheeks until she found something which turned out to be a piece of peanut shell . " Does she always do that ? " said the woman . " I do n't think it 's good for them to eat things like that . Wo n't she get convulsions ? I know banana peels will give them convulsions . " The man who stopped a moment to look at the baby walked quietly away . " My poor baby 's got a birthmark , " the woman beganagain apropos of nothing at all . " Where ? " said Gurlie . " On his face ? " " Yes , " said the woman . " I wish I knew what to do about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I ca n't see anything , " said Gurlie . She got up slowly and rubbed her knees . " Oof ! " she said straighteningherself . She went with the woman to see the sleeping child . There he lay fast asleep on the blanket , leis head turned to one side , his arms spread symmetricallyout , bent at the elbows , his hands palms up , completely relaxed . You could see him breathe . The woman turned the sleeping child 's face up so Gurlie could see it . There was a mottled red streak going up across the forehead from the base of the nose into the hair which was very blond and thin , and thep126left eyelid was also a deep winey red . " That 's nothing , " said Gurlie . " That 'll go away . Lots of children have that . I 'll bet he has another spot like it at the back of his neck . " " That 's right , " said the woman . " You do know , do n't you ? What makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be covered by hair but this one  --  " " You ought to know , they call them storch biss in German . " " You mean the stork is supposed to bite them when he brings them , is that it ? Look , he 's waking up . " The baby yawned and stretched , stiff legged . " Is n't he wonderful ? " said the mother . Gurlie nodded . The infant opened two deep blue eyes . " He 's getting so fresh now . They get so fresh at this age . Watch him ! " Gurlie was watching . He was really a very nice little boy . " He 's perfect , except for that birth mark . And they did n't circumcise him good either . We 're not Jews but my husband wanted it done so they did it . They did n't do a good job , they left too much skin . I would n't know except I 've seen other little boys . It 's just like a little acorn on the end but you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't right . " The baby opened his eyes wide now and smiled selfconsciously . Then he grew excited and , stiff legged , began to kick his feet up and down on the blanket . " He loves to do that , " said the woman . " Mother puts a pillow for him . She 's afraid he 'll hurt his heels . " Now the baby twisted his body round until he had turned over then raised his head and looked at them , smiling . " He crawls backward , " said the mother . " Why do babies always do that  --  maybe it 's because their arms are stronger than their legs . But he 's so differ/ent from his sister . With her I had troubles but he cats everything . " She picked him up . " Agh , agh , agh ! " said he standing on his toes . " He always wants to stand on his toes , " said the mother . " Sometimes when he 's lying there he 'll raise himself up on his heels and bang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt his kidneys ? " The woman wet her right index finger with her tongue and plastered a small blond curl down on the baby 's forehead . Gurlie returned to where she had been sitting . Left to themselves the two older girls had fetched spruce needles again until they had gathered enough of them to make two little patches which they called 1 ) ( As and there they were now stretched out flat on their backs , perfectly happy , talking together in low voices when back came the old lady in a fury . " Get up from that ground , " she said to the little girl while Lottie sat up , leaning back on her hands in terror . The little playmate was jerked to her feet . " Do n't spank me ! Do n't spank me ! " she cried to the old lady . " Please ! do n't spank me ! " But whang ! she got it on one side , and now on the other . Whang ! Then the woman turned on her daughter and let her have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . Gurlie paid no attention except to glance at the old woman scornfully . Flossie crawled to her and sat down right in the center of the clover . Gurlie liftedher up and as she did so suddenly glanced back at a Spot where the leaves had been turned over by thepressure of the baby 's foot . No , only two threes that had been pressed together so that it looked like a four hilt when you pulled them apart the extra leaf slipped away and became part of the other one.  |p128Lottie  's little friend was being towed weeping loudly away . She had been told to hold onto the edge of the carriage , which she did crying lustily the while  --  not looking where she was going but stumbling over her own feet and the edge of the path they dragged her off to her fate . " Come Lottie , we 'd better be going now , " said Gurlie to her older daughter . She lay back for a moment on the soft grass with her hands under her head and looked up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head sidewise on her mother 's breast . Lottie too came beside her mother and stood looking down at her.  |p129THE  LITTLE GIRL across thestreet had measles . " Just measles ? " said Gurlie . " They do n't need a doctor running in there all the time for that . Who is that doctor , I never saw him before ? " " Oh , " said one of the school teachers who lived across the hall , " he lives  --  I mean he has his office on Fifth Avenue . I think his name is Mabbot . " " There 's a lot of measles in the block , " said Gurlie to Joe that evening . " I think I 'll have the children Vaccinated . " " All right , do it . " Here he was home from Washgtonagain and the battle still on . " Do n't talk about so much . Is supper ready ? " " Yes , " said his wife , " as soon as I take care of the children . And what am I going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to do about the children ? What do you want to do with them ? Do n't ask e . Put them in a closet and close the door . " " I 'd like to sometimes . I 'm tired of doing everylingmyself around this place . Today I left them on the street while I went to the butcher 's . That little eanor was there but she 'll be going to school again Monday . I ca n't keep them in the house all day . go to the park . But there 's the whole afternoon . " " Do you want another lazy nigger around here ? " " No . I want a good white girl . I want a well trained ant this time . "   " You 've got money . Go ahead and pay for her then . " " I refuse to go on this way . " " Ask your mother to come here for the winter . I ca n't afford anything else now . She needs a place to go anyhow . Gunnar 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Gurlie 's brother  --  " unless he goes to Vermont . Get her to come over here and teach us how to keep house . " Gurlie did n't say anything . " Well , what about it ? " said Joe . " I 'd like to see it . She 's a nice old lady . " " I know you would , " said his wife . " Ask her anyhow , maybe she 'll refuse . " " She 's getting deaf , " said Gurlie . " Let her go up to Vermont . She 's too old to be with children . " " I do n't care , do what you please . I 'm hungry . Any mail ? " " Nothing but the gas bill , " said his wife . " Tear it up , " said Joe . " Where is it ? " Gurlie walked to the window , stood there a moment looking out , then came back again to where Joe was sitting . " All right , tell her to come then , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to take the children to a doctortomorrow on Fifth Avenue . " " On Fifth Avenue ! Be sure you pay a lot of money for it so you 'll know you 're in the hands of a crook . He 'll make ' em sick even if they were n't sick when l ' you took them to him , " said her husband . " You talk like a fool , " said Gurlie . " I am a fool , " said Joe . " Where are the kids , any-way ? " " In the kitchen eating their supper . Anything new ? " " Nothing , just waiting to hear from WashingtonP131again as usual . " She could see he was extremely nervous . The next day Gurlie took the children to Dr. Mabhot'soffice . There were four or five ahead of her so she was told she 'd have to wait . As they stood at the waiting room entrance they saw a half bald , middle aged man , reading a paper , who looked over the tops of his glasses at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two stout women , one short and one tall , evidently sisters . They looked at Gurlie and one said something to the other under her breath . Then there was a very pretty woman , stylishly dressed , sittingvery straight in the corner with a little girl beside her leaning on her knee . There was also near the door a very pleasant , plainly dressed woman , with a small boy on her lap , another one of about three sitting on the floor at her feet and a girl of seven or eight or so on a chair nearby . There were jalousies half drawn and heavy curtains either side the two windows facing Fifth Avenue and a large table in the center of the room on which were severalagazines . The heavy carpet on the floor made you want to1k in a low voice and it smelled of dust and camor . Lottie went first , pushed by her mother , andked down at the carpet as she went through thephor , then stepped back suddenly from the waitingroom as she found herself facing all the people sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the pleasant woman up , it wo n't hurt you . " Gurlie sat . " Thank you , " she said . Out of the corner of her eye she noted that whereas the woman was dark all her children were red-headed . Silence , absolute silence , while everybody was conscious of everyone else , sitting there stiffly , waiting . The front door-bell rang , someone else was admitted , there was a subdued conversation in the hall and the front door opened and closed again . " Strange , " said the woman at Gurlie 's right , her voice seeming to crash on everyone 's ears , " how even in a city sometimes everything is suddenly silent even on a busy street . " " Yes , " said Gurlie . It was n't but a moment later when a boy shouted and then whistled just under the window , carriages passed again and you could hear sparrows chirping loudly on the window sill . Flossie was on her mother 's right knee while the little boy was on his mother 's left knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children sick ? " said the woman . " No , I 'm just bringing them to be vaccinated , " said Gurlie . Someone passed down the hall from the office at the back of the house and went out the front door . " Miss Brown , " said the maid at the entrance to the office . " You wait here , " said one of the elderly women getting up . " No , Matilda , I 'm going with you . I want to see the doctor myself . " " I wish you would n't , " said the other . " But you know what happened last time . " " Please . " " No , I 'm going with you . " " Miss Brown , " said the maid at the door , " the doctorwill see you now . " The two women stood facing each other , then , unexpectedly , a round bald head appeared at the door . " Oh , doctor , " said the one called Matilda , " I 'm so sorry . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My sister wo n't let me ... " " Come along both of you . I low do you do , " he said to the stylish woman across the room . He gave a quick glance around at the others , smiled , bowed and stepping aside , let the two old maids go ahead of him down the corridor to the back of the house . " Whew ! " said the little plump lady with the children , " now I feel better . I could n't breathe . Sit there , Alice . " The man across the room lowered his paper a moment , looked at her over the tops of his glasses , glanced at Lottie and went on reading again . Alice did n't want to go from her mother 's side . Now look at that little girl over there , how nicely ' he behaves , " said the mother . " Do as I tell you . Shall we sit over there by the window ? " said she to Gurlie , pointing to a couch with rolled ends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in the country , it takes me all day for a visit like this . But he 's an awfully good doctor . I 've known him for years . Are you in the city ? " " Yes , " said Gurlie . " Do you believe in vaccination ? " " Nell , no , " said the woman . " I think it 's dangerous and does n't do any good anyhow . I wo n't let him ( In it . " " Everybody has it done in Europe , " said Gurlie . But here they do n't do it so much do they ? " " No , " said e woman . " Oh I suppose if a person lived in Mexico r India where thousands die of it annually  --  " Her child wanted to get off her lap . " I wonder if .. Well , " she said . " What a wild one he is . You him quiet now but it 's only for a minute . You it . I do n't know what to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the room whispered something to her mother and sat back again king haughtily at the others .    --  look at him , " said the good natured little mother jumping up and grabbing her child . " Nothing is safe ! Absolutely ! I dress him all around the room . If you just let him know you want him to go on the potty , or anything , he 's miles away . He just turns and runs . " " Waywie ! " said the child . " Baby ! he means baby , ' " said the woman to Gurlie . " He 's just beginning . But he understands everything you say , of course . " " Hat . " " Yes , hat , that 's right . Now leave the man 's hat alone , " said she jumping up once more . " Is n't he awful ? " So far Flossie had sat as if petrified while Lottie kept looking at the little boy on the floor who , while all this was going on , had n't once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talk to Alice , " said the woman to Lottie . " Go on . She likes little girls her own age . " " Oh do n't bother with her , " said Gurlie . " She can look out of the window . " Lottie looked toward the window where Alice at once preceded her . The little well dressed girl in the corner looked after them but did not move . " You know , there 's such a difference between the ages in children . We do n't realize it . There 's a little girl lives next door to us , she 's eight and Alice is just past five . There 's quite a difference between five and eight you know . You 'd be surprised at the fights and arguments they have . They both have baby brothers and you should hear them . Do you give your baby potatoes now ? " " Yes , " said Gurlie . " I do too , " said the woman . " But if I give my baby anything , then the other one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't get . Alice , do be careful dear , with those curtains . And you know what else she says ? She sees meP135dressing the baby and she says , Did you do that to me when I was a baby ? ' I have to tell her everything . You 'd be surprised what they talk about . Are you Catholic ? " " No , " said Gurlie . " Well , neither am I. But you know . . . " She looked at the well dressed woman across the room and said tut more of that . " He 's so very constipated . He 's always been that way . No matter what I give him it never works . He eats well too , takes everything . Do you give your baby cod liver oil ? " Gurlie said she did . The woman stopped suddenly and looked about the room , biting her lips . Gurlie had n't noticed till then how tired her eyes appeared . " I talk too much , " said the woman , and blinked her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had possibly wet into them . Still Flossie had made hardly a move , watching the woman fascinated . Gurlie looked at her and smiled . " She 'll tell me all about this later , " said she to the woman . " You mean she talks ! " " No , not exactly , " said Gurlie , " but she tells me all kinds of things in her own lingo and you should see her face how serious she gets , all nonsense . Very funny sometimes . " The woman gave a quick look into Gur1ie 's eyes but they were averted . " Mrs. Ambergris , " said the colored maid . " Here we go , " said the woman . " Come children . Get along here . Goodbye . Goodbye . Two sweet little girls , " she id over her shoulder to Gurlie as she left the room . And again the room was silent . Gurlie eyed theWoman in the corner and sat up straight staring at the wall opposite where there was an enormous lithograph of the Grand Canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a full three quarters of an hour later before she had her turn . " It 's about time , " she said to the imperturbable maid . " I 'll never come here again if I have to wait like this . " " What 's that ? " said the doctor who had come up on the carpet behind her . " I do n't blame you in the least . It must be very trying . " " I only want them vaccinated , " said Gurlie . " Well , come in , " in a slow gentle voice . " Do n't think I 'm not tired . Is this your whole family ? Two nice little girls . Very different , too , are n't they . Very different types . Now this one , " he said , patting Lottie on the head , " is the artist , is n't she ? You can see it  --  Well , no . I may be wrong . I do n't think she 's as sentimentalas you might believe her . Look at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Um . She 's got a will of her own , too , has n't she , but very different . You must n't cross that one  --  but this one . " He laughed . " She 's pretty fresh , is n't she ? " He laughed again . " Would you like a glass of water , Mrs.  --  eh ? " " Stecher , " said Gurlie . " Look , " he said , and he went over to the wall where there was a sort of carved bird 's nest tacked to the woodwork of the panelling about six feet from the floor . Into it were crowded , side by side , three disproportionateheads with long yellow beaks that projected over the side . From under the nest hung a string . " Look , " he said and turned his head away . " Cuckoo ! Cuckoo ! " and at the sound he pulled the string and the three big yellow beaks opened hungrily . Thep137children were thrilled . " Cuckoo ! Cuckoo ! " the birds seemed to say . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for ? " said the doctor to Gurlie . " Oh yes , for vaccination . " " But I want you to give them a thorough examination , too , " said Gurlie . " There 's a lot of sickness around this fall . " " I 'm afraid not this afternoon , Mrs. Stecher , " said he taking out his watch . " Half past three . " " She has such dry skin , " said Gurlie . " That must come from something . " " Dry skin ? " said the doctor . " Water makes it worse . " " Yes , I know . " " But I have to bathe her , doctor . " " Yes , I know you have to bathe her . So I 'll tell you what you do . You buy yourself some coarse bran . You know , feed bran , that they give to horses and cows , you can get it anywhere , five cents a pound . Put it in her bath . " " Plain , you mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a cloth bag , of course . A double fistful . se one of those salt or sugar bags you get . Tie a ring around the top and slosh that around in the bathwater . If you use it raw she 'll come out looking e a little bran muffin . " " Thank you , " said Gurlie . " Common remedies like at are always the best . " " Is there anything else ? " " No , " said Gurlie . " They 're healthy , but there 's n so much measles on the block , I thought I 'd bethavethem vaccinated anyway . " The doctor looked at her . " Uh , " he said . " You aline , of course , that vaccination is only against all pox . " " Yes , " said Gurlie quickly . " Will you bare their left arms , Miss Wallace , " he said to the nurse . " And get me a little alcohol and some cotton . " " Queer little things , are n't they ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted a daughter . " " Have you no children ? " said Gurlie . " Two boys , twelve and fourteen . But I always wanted a girl . I always wanted to play with her , dress her , undress her , put her to bed , watch her run around the place and grow up  --  there 's a lot of woman in most men , Mrs. . . " Stecher , " said Gurlie . " Yes , in doctors anyhow  --  a lot of woman . Just as well I never had a daughter though , I suppose . My wife says if I had ever had a daughter she 'd have been on the street before she was sixteen if I had anything to do with her . " He laughed . Gurlie was watching the nurse . " You know , " he went on , looking at Gurlie and apparentlyin no hurry at all , though his nurse had placed the materials for the vaccination on the table and stood waiting , cuddling the children . " Funny littlethings , are n't they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing there with their arms bared waiting . She wondered if all doctors were like that . Well , old ones anyhow . I wonder what his wife thinks . " Let 's see , " said the doctor looking at his card . " Why you live on lo4th St. Why of course . Right across the street from a little girl I 've been taking care of there . Oh yes . She 's a very sick child . In fact she has pneumonia , a very sick child . They refuse to let me take her to a hospital . I 'm worried about that child . " " You mean you think ... " " Let 's hope not , " said the doctor . " Strange how we spend our lives for our children . It is n't worth it . It is n't worth it , neitherP139to them nor to us . It 's all over with them before we 've even had a chance to make up our minds . It 's finished . Whatever they 're going to be . It 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be speaking of soinething specific which he did not reveal . " What do you mean ? " said Gurlie . " Take your little girl there . She 'll be two next April . All right . I suppose you have plans for her , all that sort of thing . But you do n't realize that what 's going on today , now , is what is determining her life . What you say to her , what you do to her , your tone of voice , your own misfortunes . . . " Doctor , do n't you think you 'd better ... " " Yes , let 's do the older one first . She wo n't cry . I can tell that . Cuckoo ! remember now . Be a good girl . " So he wiped the arm off with alcohol , just below the shoulder and taking a needle between his fingersraped and scraped and scraped drawing parallel ' lines downward on the skin for a full quarter inchen cross hatching them at right angles until thehole small area was oozing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm away because itas slow and painful but the nurse held her tightly. e would n't cry but the tears rolled down her cheeksstreams for all that . " Why you 're hurting her , " said Gurlie . " Not as much as you hurt her when you gave birth . her , " said the doctor . That stopped Gurlie for a moment . " Now what are you going to do ? " said she . ' Vaccinate her , " said he . He cracked a small glass be and with a tiny rubber bulb forced the yellowish material it contained onto the child 's scratched arm . " I think it 's terrible , " said Gurlie , " to make a child sick that way . That 's not natural . "   " Nothing is natural in medicine , " said the doctor . " But we do what we find is effective because we do n't know anything else better to do . During our RevolutionaryWar smallpox decimated the population of Philadelphia . Now the baby . Miss Wallace , put a littlegauze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twisting and turning herself with all her might to get away . " No good , little girl , " said the doctor , " you 're in the hands of your elders now . God help you . " " I do n't care , " said Gurlie . " I 'm sorry I came . I do n't like it . " " If that was the worst you were doing to her , I 'd agree with you . But it 's not , by far . Do n't worry . A pessimist , huh ? Am I not ? Doctors as a class are inclined to be . And to love children . She wo n't rememberthis , any more than  --  anything you can imagine . Look , " he said . " Cuckoo ! Cuckoo ! " and he pulled the string under the birds again and both the children were spellbound , smiling through their tears . " We 're the losers , not they . You know I like to write .

It 's called  --  where is it , Wallace ? I 've forgotten what I called it . " " What is it ? " said Gurlie . " Just one of a series , describing the child during the second year of its life . " " Where do you get them ? " said Gurlie . " I write them and have them printed to give away to my patients . Just a hobby . I should have been a writer . Just for my own amusement . I want to writep141one for every year of a child 's life , up to ten or twelve or so . This is as far as I 've got , " said he with a laugh . " Take it home . Oh , are you going back to 104th St. ?

As Joe , tired and uncertain in mind , was approaching the apartment that evening he passed two girls of about eleven years or so who were saying goodnight to each other at the curb . They had already separated and one was looking back from the center of the street when her friend called to her in a quiet voice , " Well , goodnight  --  " then there was a short pause  --  " and sweet dreams , Katherine !

Very important to us here . Indispensable in fact . " Then turning to his lawyer , " You and McColum know each other , do n't you Blake ? " " Yes , Dan and I know each other . " " Hm . As well as that , huh ? " " Well , do n't let 's waste time in preliminaries , gentlemen . Let 's get right down to business . Do you mind if Dan sits in on this , Blake ? We 've nothing to hide . Everything is on the level here . I asked him up to see if we can cooperate with him in any way here in this ward  --  and he can give us a hand maybe . " " Yes , Dan 's all right . " " You know what it 's all about , do n't you Dan ? " " I 've heard some talk . " " There are two things we 've got to do . First we want to work out something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . He 's in a tight fix down there and we 've got to help him . The other thing is our own business , and this is where you come into theP143picture , Percy . We want you to tell us what happened in Atlantic City yesterday , to see what help we can get there . " " Wait a minute , wait a minute , " said McColum . " You 're too fast for me . You got to take it a little easier . " " Do n't you read the papers , Dan ? " asked Blake . " No , never bother with ' em when I want to find out what 's going on . I hear you 're having some kind ( ) f battle with the government . Is that right ? " " Being careful , eh Dan ? " " Yes , just being careful , that 's all . " " Tell him , Percy . " The old man was sitting on a small table in the center of the hotel room , his hat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ill assorted assembly of chairs , some of them frail and gilded , completely out of place . Young Wynnewood and Caldwell 's nephew were together on a couch along the wall . " I 'll tell him , " said lawyer Blake . " You see , there was a convention in Atlantic City yesterday . There is a sort of ex-printers ' society called the Associates . They 're supposed to take care of the ideals of the trade or something like that . We needed their help . So we sent our best front , Grossman , down there to see what he could do with them . " " Now , " said Dan McColum , " that 's not what I mean . I do n't want to mix up in you gentlemen 's work here . I see you got stuff to do . All I want is a general idea of the whole situation , what you want me to do for you , in a general sort of way . " " That 's just what we 're coming to , Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have a few drinks in a little while , as soon as Caldwell gets here . I want you to give us some advice . But you got to hear the story first . " " All right , go ahead , only do n't blame me if I fall asleep on you . I did n't get much rest last night . " " What happened , Dan ? A meeting ? " " One of my kids got married yesterday . We had a big time . " " I did n't know you had children that old , Dan . " " Yes , my oldest daughter . You better tell me what you want me to do in as few words as you can make it . " The old man looked at Blake and Blake looked at the old man . " Give him the general layout , will you , Blake ? I thought you understood it , Dan . " " I remember you told me but I have too much on my mind these days . You got this former employe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take our business away by underhand methods . Stealing it right under our eyes . " " You mean he 's crooked ? How 'd he get the edge on you down there in Washington ? They 're a pretty tough crew to handle down there . Politics ? " " No . But he has good friends . " " Oh ! What 's he got on you ? " " Not a thing . " Dan looked the old man squarely in the eye and the old man took it without a flicker . " Crooked business methods . We 're no match for him . What 's business coming to anyhow when any little squirt of an employe thinks he can run out on you every time he . . . " " Take it easy , J. W. , " said his lawyer . " You see , Dan , J. W. here has brought this Stecher up in the firm for the past ten years . He 's taught him the business , given him the breaks whenever the opportunity arose . P145Why even now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he 'll say the word . He 's offered to increasehis salary , give him a percentage on the businesshe brings in  --  forgive and forget . You could n't ask anything more generous than that . But no , he wo n't do it . He 's obstinate . And he 'll go to any extremesto stab his old friend in the back . Why he 's even brought criminal charges against Mr. Wynnewoodhere . That cuts a man to the quick . That 's what 's got us all heated up this way . What are you going to do in business if any unscrupulous person gets away with a thing like that ? Why there wo n't be an organization safe in the city . If labor gets away with that sort of thing we 're all sunk . See what I mean ? " " Yeah , " said Dan . " You got ta stop him . " " Yes , we have to stop him , " said Grossman . " We ca n't allow such disloyalty to succeed . It 's immoral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever we have done that the governmentdisapproves of can be explained on a basis of different standards , nothing dishonest  --  just a different way of looking at the same thing . " " Thanks , Grossman . That 's the idea , " said Blake . " We 've got to stop him . " " Well , how you gon na do it ? " said Dan . " I mean how far do you wan na go ? " " God damn it , " said Mr. Wynnewood . " Now wait a minute , wait a minute , J. W. We got troubles . Do n't think we have n't . " Then turning to McColum , " They 've got an indictment out for the Boss and Mr. Caldwell 's young nephew , Hubert , here . We 've got to stick strictly to facts . " The young man indicated flushed crimson then turned white when Dan looked at him . " We can take pare of that , " added Blake . " That is n't it but we do n't Want any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop him but we ca n't come out too strong while this is pending . " " Ai n't there no way - you can beat him legal ? " " What 's illegal about this ! " stormed the old man at once . " That 's all right , " Said Dan . " Do n't get excited . I Ret it . " He pursed up his lips and began whistling gently to himself . " Listen , Blake , " broke in Wynnewood , Sr. , " we have n't got a hell of a lot of time . Caldwell will be here at four he said , we want to get this part of our talk through with . Dan you 've got to help us . " " Yeah , I know . But you could n't work it from Washington , could you ? We got to be a little careful here in New York right now . Teddy 's all heated up for reforms and all that . What have you done down there ? " " We 're trying to get them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and play ball so we have hopes that Way . Perce , will you tell him what you did yesterday ? You see he 's got to begin delivering those blanks to the Post Office Department in six weeks . He has no plant and under the law he ca n't sublet the contract so there 's a definite time limit . Mr. Grossman . " Percy Grossman stood up and cleared his throat . " Well , I went to Atlantic City yesterday , as I told you a moment ago , to address the Associates , to see if they Would n't intervene with the President for us . " " The Associates , " slid Mr. Blake , " is an organization of printers interested in upholding the standards ofp147their trade . Mostly men who formerly held high positions in various large printing establishments of the country  --  " " Let me tell him , Blake , will you please ? " said Percy Grossman . " Just a washed out bunch of  --  , " began the old man . " It was my suggestion , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregularity of Mr. Stecher 's proceedingsin this case , that it constituted a grave breach of business ethics . And I thought why not ? That 's what the Associates are interested in , why not appeal to them . " The old man sunk his teeth into his cigar . Crossmanturned to young Caldwell . " Our Mr. Caldwell accompanied me . How do you think it went , Hubert ? Do n't you think we made an impression ? " " Yes , sir ! " said the young man . " It 's purely a matter of ethics , " went on Grossman . " Now listen , Perce , " began J. W. " Let him tell us what he did . " " Christ , what the hell 's the use of all this talk ? " " Because it 's a point of major importance , J. W. I gave them such a speech as they 'll never forget , I can tell you . They applauded for a good five minutes after I sat down . Then they appointed the committee . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to do ? " said McColum . " They intend to appeal direct to the President of the United States . He can order the whole business wiped out and the bids resubmitted . " " That 's the stuff , " said McColum . " Yes , I know , " took up Blake , " but we ca n't count too heavily on that . This thing has already got into the papers . Prominently too . Things have been pretty hot for everybody in the Post Office Department recently . The newspapers are not going to let them whitewash it this time . If it were n't for that , there 'd be nothing to it . We could suppress it overnight . " " I think it was a tactical mistake though for Mr. Caldwell to use his official powers to  --  " That 's as far as young Willie Wynnewood got . They all turned to look at him . " What the hell do you know about it ? " interrupted his father . " You see , Dan , we got to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's good night . There 's no limit to what he wo n't do . He 's got letters in his possession that belong to this firm  --  " " All right , J. W. Let 's stick to practical procedures , " said Blake . " You see , Dan , he 's got to open up here in the city damned quick if he 's going to get away with this contract . If he ca n't deliver the goods that 's the end of him . He 's got to have a loft to operate in . You see ? And lie 's got one . We knew that but we could n't find it till yesterday when one of our men saw him sneaking in there eight o'clock yesterday morning . He 's got to install his presses there at once for one thing and you know that 's slow work . " " Who owns the building ? " " Ca n't afford to find out , Dan . We got to do it some other way . " " God damn it , Dan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building Inspector ... " " All right , all right . I 'll take a look at the place tonightand let you know what I can do . " Dan raised his heavy body from the narrow arm . P149chair where he was sitting and brushed the cigar ashes from his vest with one beefy , gold ringed hand . " Well , boys , I think I 'll be getting on . " " We 're expecting Mr. Caldwell here in a few minutes , Dan . Do n't you want to stay and meet him ? " " No . Not today , Wynnewood . Some other time . " " Hubert will go with you , Dan , and show you the building . " " All right , gentlemen . Always glad to help a friend . " " I wish I could say that about a few other people I know , " broke in the old man . " It 's that kind of thing that you 're doing now for us , Dan , that makes for good business and good citizenship . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the full dinner pail and a square deal to labor and all that crap  --  Where does it get you when you have your own men stabbing you in the back every chance they get ? Where do they think their money 's coming from anyway ? Where the hell do they think it 's coming from ? Well , I do n't want to get all steamed up again . Maybe we can do something for you some day , Dan . You can count on us whenever you think it 's necessary . " " I 'll be round . Do n't you worry . Do you print weddinginvitations in your plant , things like that ? " " Dan , we 'll have one engraved on vellum for you if you want it . " Dan laughed . " Well , so long boys , " he said and started for the door . " Hubert , go on with Mr. McColum . Take a cab and show him where that place is on Center St. " " Do n't bother , " said McColum , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take him along with you , Dan  --  " the old man gave his friend a broad wink , " take him along . Go on Hubert . I 'll tell your uncle you 'll be in later . " So the two went off together . They went down in the elevator , the young good looking ex-collegiate business man and the heavy , broad shouldered politician , his Derby hat on his head , his grey eyes glancing out placidly from under shaggy brows . " Shall I call a cab , Mr. McColum ? " " No . It ai n't more than three or four blocks from here cross town . Come on , young fella , let 's foot it . I hate those damn cabs . I been quite a walker in my day , " he added . " Used to come across the Brooklyn Bridge on my feet every morning when I was a youngster , and back every night . I never did get used to the insides of a cab . " They stopped at Sixth Ave . while a string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his team , leaning far over to hit the near horse under the tail with the ends of the reins . The horse jumped a little , raising his head as he dragged at the load then settled into his slow pace once more . " You say you used to cross the Brooklyn Bridge every day , " said young Caldwell . " What for ? " " What for ? Because I damn well had to . Twenty years ago that was . I was a weak , thin lad then , not much older than that kid over there , " he said pointing to a youngster gaunt cheeked and dirty leaning against a fire hydrant . " I worked , I tell you , and worked hard in those days and I 'm not lying to you . " " What do you think they 'll do to us in Washington , Mr. McColum ? " " It 'll go before the Grand Jury , I suppose , " saidP151the older man , " and you 'll have to put up bail and that 'll be the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a couple of friends . Yes sir , I could walk that bridge in about sixteen minutes when I was in my stride twenty years ago . But it was cold in winter I can tell you . " Down one gutter , across the uneven cobbles , separatedby the traffic to come beside each other again on the other side , up again and along the block . " I used to work for a fella down on Water St. He was about the meanest man I ever knew . Grantland was his name . He kept a leather shop where they sold harness and the rest of it . I 'll never forget him . He 's dead sixteen years ago , lucky for him . But he 'll never know it . " Young Caldwell did n't want to hear that but he had to put a good face on it and ask Dan McColum to go on . " It 's a long time now since those days , " said the big man , " and there have been many changes in myself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to look interested . " I never expected to live this long , never . My mother died at twenty when I was three years old . She had some kind of heart trouble , I do n't know what it was . And my father died at thirty-three of tuberculosis . That was a pretty bad beginning for me . If anybodyhad told me I was going to live to be older than my father had been , I 'd have told him he was crazy . " " I 've been working ever since I was ten . I had bad teeth and was knocked about , two weeks here , two weeks there . I tell you it was n't easy . Not that I 'm complainingonly I did n't expect to live long , that 's all I mean . And here I am forty and as good as ever . Better , by God . No doubt of that . " " My first job was with a man on Fulton St. in Brooklyn . When I think what I did for three dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , I found out later , that man made me walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and back every day just to save the three cents carfare . They had the cablecars , you would n't remember , in those days . I could n't afford it . I was poor , I tell you , then . I gave every cent I got , the whole three dollars , to the people I was living with . " " Oh I had an uncle who had money . I remember once I asked him for three dollars for a pair of shoes I needed . Do you know I got the lecture of my life on how to economise and get the most out of my money . On three dollars a week ! But here I am as good as I ever was . I have n't been to a doctor in fifteen years . " " Nor to a dentist either , " said young Caldwell to himself , but he nodded his head as if fascinated by the story and seemed to wait for the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan ? " ventured the young man after a few moments of silence . " Yes , I read , stories and books sometimes . I like my dirt . Sex and all that . Knee boots , and I want to hear it suck when I pull ' em out . " " That 's a nice critical attitude . " " ' s got to face a lot of competition , when I read . Try it sometimes when you want to get your mind off something . Say , why n't you write one  --  with your education ? There ought to be money in it , that sort of stuff . Police Gazette and all that . " They went along together , passing the Tombs . " There it is , " said Dan McColum without emotion asP153if it might have been a cottage he 'd just built in the country . Walk , walk , walk , each man wrapped in his own thoughts . Down a gutter , over the street and up anothergutter . Along the block , encountering looks of one sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they arrivedacross Center Street from the number they were seeking . There Dan stopped before a drugstore windowfull of patent medicines . He took a quill toothpickfrom his pocket , turned around and stared across the street . " Hum ! " he said . " That must be the place . " " Yes , " said young Caldwell . They stood and looked for a full minute without exchanging a word . It was a six story building with a freight elevator inside the right front windows . Dan was having a good deal of trouble dislodging somethingfrom between two of his back teeth . " Does n't look strong enough to me to carry a line of heavy presses . " He finally succeeded with his teeth , cleaned the end of the quill between thumb and finger and deposited it in his vest pocket again . " Guess we 'll have to see what the Building Inspectors have to say about that in the morning . " He stood there awhile as if turning the matter over in his mind . " Well , good night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With that he turned about and walked away . Young Caldwell felt snubbed . He wanted to know more about the mind and ways of these influential New York politicians  --  much more , as he stood and watched the broad back of Dan McColum recede along Center St. before him .   I IIAD A LETTER fromGunnar today . He said he 'd bring your mother next Sunday . " " Next Sunday ! Why did n't he write to me instead of you ? " " Because I wrote to him . How much did that doctorcharge you ? " " Five dollars . " " What ! " said Joe . " That 's robbery . Did you give it to him ? " " Yes , " said Gurlie . " He brought us home in his carriage , right to the door . " " Yah , " said Joe . " What 's this ? " picking up the pamphletDr . Mabbot had given Gurlie . " A pamphlet he gave me . He writes them and has them printed privately , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheap get up generally , no money in that . " " Read it , " said Gurlie . " Did you ? " " No . " " Then what do you expect me to do with it ? " But Joe took it up nevertheless and sat down under the light . Gurlie had n't put the children to bed yet but let them play around in their night clothes for a few minutes first as usual . Joe read the title : The Child 's Development Duringthe Second Year . " How much did he charge you for this ? " " I told you he gave it to me , " said Gurlie . " It ca n't be worth much then , " said her husband as he turned the thing over . " The second year of a baby 's life , ' " he read ,   " seems to us often a featureless waste . But it is the time for all that when we see him learn to walk and to talk , long before memory begins . Nor is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Does he talk like that ? " " No , " said Gurlie . " That 's good .  --  the external evidences of the most intensely packed and important months of our entire life . '  --  I do n't see much in this , " said Joe . " He gave it to me , " said Gurlie , " I 'd just like to know what it says . " " Why do n't you read it yourself ? " " I ca n't bother . " " What do you want me to do ? " " Just tell me what it says . " " Infanthood is past , ' " Joe began reading again , " along with the immediate and pressing attentions given to the child during the first , which is the physical , year , but the waif , after all , has to go on . ' " " Disagree , " said Joe . " This is to be not a plant nor a mere animal but a human being . It begins to experience now its first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , largely hidden from our view  --  A larval year , more than any other in a lifetime , largely hidden from our view ' "  --  he read again  --  " it gives the mind its enduring form . It gives the mind its form . ' "  --  Joe read that over and chewed his moustache a moment . "  --  Must and must not become now violently compelling . The universe expands so rapidly now for the small traveler , marooned as he is here , that a man may seek and will usually find all his excuses in misfortunefor the rest of his days in what has taken place ( luring this year .  --  ' " " I suppose he means , " Joe mused , " that what takes place during this year is what settles his hash for life .   Maybe so . What of it ? Yet it will be obscurely buried , never to be exhumed in its true character either in song or story . Buried and gone forever . ' " " Not bad , " said Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all right . " " The small prisoner has to be forced into the accidentalmould of the life his or her parents find forced upon them in turn by their own more or less accidentaleconomic and hereditary circumstances . He must be " house broke , " disciplined to a thousand postures and procedures , whereas all he knows is that his arms , with fingers at the tips  --  for he has sucked them often  --  fly about and touch that which falls with a crash  --  not equal to the jarring effects administered across his backside as a consequence , which astonishes his reason as much as it pains his body .  --  ' " " How do you like it ? " said Gurlie . " Hum ? " said Joe without looking up . " It 's all right . " He went on reading . " What the devil ? the unformed mind seems to say . Two and two make four .

' " " No . This is too silly , " said Joe . " I think all doctors are crazy . " But he went on reading . Things are rather quiet around this place , the baby seemed to say , let 's see if sometimes two and two do not make five  --  Crash ! and sure enough it was a real crash this time . Everybody jumped . Joe gave a big laugh . " That 's pretty good . " He got up and went to the baby 's aid . Gurlie let him go . Joe picked the baby up after seeing that it was n't P157hurt and said , " Good ! I 've been wondering how long before we were going to get rid of that damned thing , " and he began gathering the pieces of a particularly ugly flower vase that had been standing on the small wall table a moment before and threw them into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . " Na , na , na ! Get out of that basket , " and he placed the basket on the desk and sat down to read again . " ' It is at this time , ' " the pamphlet went on , " that the morals of a lifetime are implanted , what we will do and what we will not do of good and bad in our lives thereafter . For the moment everything is colored the same . Which way will it go ? What will this small mind conclude from its experiences ?  --  ' " A fine fellow ! this Joe , the baby seemed to be saying and moved slowly toward him . Joe understood also and took it all in good part . As he read he felt the baby pull itself up by his pants leg and stand at his knee . He paid little attention to her . She put her little mouth down on the taut cloth of his flexed knees and rubbed her gums against it . Then out of an excess of emotion or the pure spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her little teeth into the flesh of her father 's thigh . The effect was instantaneous and brilliant . Joe , caught off his guard , wrenched his knee suddenly away from the pain , knocking the baby sprawling . And this time she did let out a howl , more of surprise and consternation than from any hurt she had received . Gurlie came running . " What have you done now ? " she cried at her husbandpicking the baby up and kissing her .   " She bit me ! " said Joe . " She bit you ? " said Gurlie looking at him disgustedly . " Good . " " Go on , bite her , " said Joe to his daughter . " Maybe she 'll taste better to you than I did . Ow ! " he said rubbing his thigh . " What power they have in those jaws ! Those teeth are like needles . " " Come Lottie , " said her mother . " Get in bed both of you . I 'll bring you some water . Do what I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , you ca n't have anything . " " Look , " said Joe at the window when Gurlie came back from putting the children down . " I think something has happened across the street . That child must have died . " " You mean that little girl that we heard singing last week ? " " Who else then ? Go down and find out , " said Gurlie . " Why should I go ? " said Joe . " I do n't know the people . Go yourself  --  there 's nothing I can do . " Gurliewent into the bedroom , looked at herself in the glass a moment , gave her hair a few pokes and then went downstairs to find out if what she suspected were true . Joe went to his desk , unlocked and opened it and , sitting down , began to look through his papers . " Yes , she died , " said Gurlie coming back after a few moments . " That 's too bad , " said her husband . " Is there anything we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see tomorrow . What are you doing ? " " Just looking over some papers . " " Did you see what I cut out for you from the New York Times ? " She handed him a clipping .   " Yes , I saw that . " But he went on reading : RULING IN STECHER 'S FAVORNew York Man held to be Qualified Bidder forMoney Order Blank Contract Special to New York Times . Washington , September 6 : Some complications surroundthe contest for the contract to print money order blanks in connection with which Frank E. Caldwell , Chief of the Money Order Service , was dismissed . Assistant Attorney General Black has decided that Joseph Stecher of this city , who offered the lowest bid , is a qualified bidder . The labor organizations of Philadelphia , Baltimore and New York have joined in a most earnest protest against giving the contract to a non-union concern . Today a committee from the Allied Printing Trades submitted a protest against giving the contract to Stecher on the ground that he is not a member of the Printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also come here to put in a remonstrance on the ground that to give the contract to Stecher would be to encourage treachery in employees . Mr. Stecher and Mr. Blake , the attorney for the Mohawk Press , were at the department today , each urging his side of the matter . It seems likely that the contract will be given to Stecher if he gives assurances that he will run a union shop and get in line with the organized printing trades , as he no doubt will . He says he can get his machinery in order to supplyp160blanks by December 4 , and that he will conform to all requirements imposed by the department . There is , however , a possibility that Stecher may not get the contract because he knew of his rival 's bid before he made his own . In a case decided by the PostmasterGeneral not long ago the bids were thrown out for a similar reason , the competition being declared unfair . Joe continued looking at the clipping , shaking his head slowly from side to side . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He put the clipping down and started closing his desk . " Do n't close that desk , " said his wife . " Why ? is there something here you want ? " " I want to know more of what 's going on . I refuse to go on living this crazy life any longer , " said Gurlie . " Have you got a contract or what ? I do n't know . Now I want to know where we stand . " " All right , " said Joe , " sit down here and I 'll tell you . " Gurlie got a dining room chair and pulled it up beside her husband . " Here , look at this . " " What is it ? " said Gurlie . Joe took a roll of paper in his hand and smoothed it out on the desk before them . It was a double sheet of foolscap unruled save for double red lines marking the margin at the left . Gurlie took it into her own hands . " Where have you been hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show it to you two or three weeks ago  --  but you were too busy talking . " " Do n't talk like that . You tried to show me nothing . " You remember when I showed you the silverP161loving cup the employes gave me when I quit ? Well , this went with it . " " Oh , " said Gurlie . " You mean that . What good is it ? " " Go ahead , see what it says , " said Joe . It was written out in long hand , a fine shaded script with several of the principal words underlined in red ink .

Respectfully yours , And then followed the signatures , a single long line of them down the page , in order , on the line , a space for each and each space numbered , in red ink , from 1 to 47 .

" They look like German , and English and Irish . But what 's Lopides ? What kind of a name is that ? " Gurlie began to read aloud : " Jos . Berwanger , E. J. Brittain , Carl Bull , Rose Carey . . . They 're all right . " " Why sure , " said Joe . " What did you expect ? There 's a group that I hand picked . They can be depended on to do a good job . " Gurlie went on : " Carpenter , Cronin , Eulner , Fagan , Traub , Frank , Gillespie , Gallager , Stasia Hanrahan . I wonder how she got the name of Stasia . Maybe her mother was a Russian : Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joe leaned to look . " Hartiger . Nellie Hartiger . Huh , you seem to know them pretty well , " said his wife . " Is she pretty ? " " Oh forget it , " said Joe . " No , I want to know who they are . " " You wo n't find out that way , " said herP163husband . " Yes , I will . " Gurlie began to skip : " John J. Hayes , C. Fred Heilshorn . A Jew ? " " No . " " Hohmann , Hube , Ingraham , Jeffreys , Jeffs , Kelly , Lopides , McDaragh , McGuire , Mehan , Mays , Neidinger , Sosovsky , M. Yeszinsky , S. Yeszinski . Well , " said Gurlie , " what do they want ? " " They want to come with me when I open my new shop , " said Joe . " All of them ? Can they do that ? " " They can do what they please , " said Joe . " I did n't ask them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you. , , Joe took a sheet of paper from the desk and began to demonstrate it to Gurlie . " Now pay attention , " he said , " and I 'll go over the whole thing in a few words  --  and let that be an end ( ) f it . Look here . " She took one look . " I ca n't understand all that . " " If you ca n't understand this then you ca n't understand anything and I might just as well not waste my time . It 's a four year contract . You understand that . It 's to print the United States Money Order forms . My successful bid was to the amount of $135,000 a year for the four years . " " You ? A hundred and thirty five thousand dollars ! Is that all right ? " " Sure it 's all right . Do you think I could do it for less ? " " Maybe you made a mistake in your figuring . " Gurlie was a little frightened . " Suppose you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Joe .   " Can they do anything to you ? " " Put me in jail , maybe , " said Joe . " My bid was $40,000 lower than that of the Mohawk Press . There were only three bidders . The other bid was way up out of the picture . " " Could n't you have bid a little higher and still gotten it ? " " Sure , " said Joe , " if they had told me what the others were going to bid first . Now listen to what I 'm going to say and I 'll give you some figures  --  to show you what it 's like . To show you the work that 's got to be done before I can begin operating . " He rubbed his thigh a moment where the baby had bitten him . " If you do n't understand , stop me and tell me what it is you want to know . " " Go ahead , " said Gurlie . " I understand . " " First I had to submit my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith . I did that the middle of July . I knew the specifications were for cheaper paper than four years ago so I took advantage of that . I knew the old company had to operate on several floors  --  that adds expense . That was another thing . I figured on my own experience . " " Who do you talk to when you go to Washington about all this ? " " Most of my dealings have been with Frank E. Caldwell . " " Who 's he ? " " For goodness sake ! " said Joe . " I 've been talking about him to you for the past ten years . The one that 's been fired . " " Yes , but what was he ? " " He 's the Chief of the Money Order Bureau . He had charge of the whole business . But the importantp165man is Davids , the First Assistant Postmaster General . He 's the important figure . " " Is he for you ? " " Yes . If he were n't honest I would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black . Those are the two . Whatever those two decide , Payne is likely to adopt . Next to the President he has full sway . " Gurlie looked up at him but did n't make any comment . " Now , " said Joe , " do you know what I 'm talking about ? " " Go on , " said Gurlie , " do n't act like a child . " " All right . I was the lowest bidder for $ 13J,000 , the lowest price in the history of the department . What I was bidding on was to print books of blank money orders , on an average of 1400 books a week with from 50 to 500 blanks in each one . They must be printed on special paper , bound and  --  under the new rule  --  shipped direct to the various post offices in the United States . That means we have to keep them tinder strict guard while they are in our possession . " " How much is that a year ? " " That 's for a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . " " You bid that ? On what ? " " On my ability to turn out the blanks . " " Good for you , " said Gurlie in genuine admiration . " Can you do it ? " Joe laughed in spite of himself . " A man can do anything if he has the right kind of a wife to back him , " said he . Gurlie laughed too . " Yes , I can do it , " he added  --  " with help . You see , one thing they 're objecting to is that I have no plant . The others sayp166my bid is illegal because of that . You see , they 're bringing up all kinds of technical points . " " What happens in that case ? " said Gurlie . " They had to have a ruling on it . That 's where the Assistant Attorney General first came into the case . We had to appear and give our testimony and he ruled in my favor . He said mine was a bona fide bid . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " what do they mean ? " " Well , that does n't make any difference in the face of the law . Anyhow I won that point . The spirit of the law was that the contract should go to the lowest bidder and the lowest bidder got it . But I had to post an additional forfeit of $50,000 to insure against my failure to fulfill the contract  --  in case I could n't do it . You see I have no plant . " " But you will have one . " " I hope so . " " Yes , you must gamble . I have always said that . You 'll never get anywhere if you do n't gamble . " " People that make money do n't gamble , " said Joe . " They just cut the other fella 's throat , that 's all . " " Where do you get all this money ? " said Gurlie . " I have n't got any money , " said her husband . " Ido n't need it . I 'm not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then my backers will have to pay . " " Oh , " said Gurlie . " I wo n't have to pay . " " Urn ! We 're going to live high , I can see that . " " Yah , " said Joe , " if the presses and the rent and the payroll do n't eat up all the profits . Do n't fool yourself that I 'm going to make much money on that contract . It 's only the prestige that it will give me thatP167means anything . I may have to print at a loss if prices shift next year . " " What do you mean , at a loss ? " " We 'll lose money on it . " " What is happening now ? " said Gurlie . " You 've seen it in the paper , " said her husband . " Everything 's just hanging fire . But they ca n't wait too long . Whoeverprints them , the orders have to begin to be delivered by December first . " " But you still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option on three places . One on Center Street and two others . I 've ordered six Hoe presses and have options on two others if I need them . I 'll have no difficulty with the paper . Ink should n't be any trouble . Now if what these people say , these names here  --  if what they say is true , that they 'll come over to me  --  I 'll have the skilled help I want . " " Marvelous ! " said Gurlie . " You 're a regular little Napoleon , are n't you ? I love you , " and she grabbed him unceremoniously around the neck  --  or meant to but he ducked and she only got him round the nose and the eyes . She hugged hard while he tried to ! pry her off snorting and trying to speak . " You 're wonderful , " she said biffing him on the ear playfully . " Na , na , na ! " he yelled . " What 's the matter with you . " " We 're going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Gurlie . " I do n't care what you say . Tomorrow I 'm going to get a nice Scandinavian girl at the agency . I tell you I will . " " All right , all right . Get her but leave me alone . " " I will get her , " said Gurlie .   " Where 'll we put her , with your mother here ? " " That 's right , " said Gurlie , " where will we put her ? " " Do you want to hear the rest of this ? " asked Joe . " Is there any more ? " said Gurlie . " Well , I have n't got the contract yet , " said her husband . " Oh but you 'll get it . Wo n't you ? " " Do n't forget ! one man has already lost his job and he has a kinsman in the Wynnewood Grossman Co . He 's been there for the past six years . " " You never told me about that . " " It goes this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed blanks themselves . But it was a bad business . We sent them the blanks in bulk and they distributed them a few here and a few there to small post offices throughout the country  --  they had all kinds of trouble with it . For instance , if an office in Brooklyn wanted a small lot of fifty blanks . Well , we printed them , shipped them to Washington who in turn unpacked them , put them in the small lot required and mailed them back to New York . " " I can see that 's wasteful , " said Gurlie . " So they decided to let us send the orders direct to the various offices . I had charge of that . We have n't had a misshipment in eight years . I tell you that , just so you 'll know . " " Well ? " said Gurlie . " Well , we did n't do that for nothing . We got paid for it . We got paid outside the contract . The old man asked for 61/2 cents a book for delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed on finally . Even that was far beyond the cost . The boys got the differ-P169ence , about 1 1/6 cents a book . I just found that out last week . " " You do n't mean it ! " " Yop . The boss 's son Willie  --  I never did like that little squirt  --  and young Hubert Caldwell . Each got a divvy . Not only that but it explains something else I could n't understand . We used to print books of 500 blanks but recently they never go out in any denominationhigher than 200 . That makes two and a half times as many books . Not a bad idea . " " Think of that , " said Gurlie . " That 's what they mean by graft , I suppose . " " It mounts up to about $9,000 a year each for the two young gentlemen . Pretty good for a young man just starting out in business . " " But are you sure of that ? " said Gurlie . " Oh no , " said Joe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nobody marked the money . " " But are n't they going to be tried ? " " Yes , " said Joe . " They 'll be arrested and they 'll put up a nice fat bail bond and later on the Grand Jury will smoke a lot of cigars over it and that 'll be the end of it . Mark my word . " " Then we do n't have to care about anything , " said Gurlie , " if that 's the kind of government we have . " " But I have to care , " said Joe , " because that 's goingto make bad blood . Then there were those God damned Associates . They went to the President last week , that 's the latest thing , to object to my methods ' of doing business . And the papers say the President was impressed by their objections to my business methods . I think I 'll have to go to Washington for the tenth time on Monday . Davids says that Payne is to see the President that day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called . " " Called for what ? " " If I have to appear . " " Appear where ? " " Before the President . " " You ? " " Yes , he 's not afraid of me . " " You mean you have to talk to him ? " " I do n't know , but I think so . " " Ohl Then you tell him what crooks those people are . This is your chance . Tell him the truth so he 'll know it for once . You tell him what it 's all about . Oh , " said Gurlie , " I wish I could be there . Wonderful . I 'd like to see his face . He 'd better be good to you  --  " " What does he care about me , " said Joe . " My only chance is that Payne is in difficulties hanging over from the McKinley administration and I think they 'd both like to see the mess cleaned up . I do n't think that under the circumstances they 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose it is a scandal , is n't it ? " " Washington is the toughtest place in the country to bring a public rascal to justice , but I think this time , with the pressure there is from the press and the general electorate  --  if we do n't make any mistakes  --  we 'll get the final decision next week . " " Let 's pray for next week then , " said Gurlie . " I 'm going to pray tonight . You 'll get it . Something tells me so . " " Probably your vanity , " said her husband . " Well , somebody 's got to have pride in this family . I 'm as good as anybody else in the country , or in the world for that matter , bejabbers , and I can prove it . My family goes back five hundred years without a break . The Vikings traded with Ireland and even dis-P171covered America before any of the rest of Europe was civilized . We settled in Sicily , in Normandy  --  we had the whole world afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it from anybody . You wait and see . " " I 'm waiting , " said Joe . " Meanwhile , let 's go to bed , I 'm tired . " " You always want to go to bed just when everybody else wants to stay up . That 's what 's the matter with you . I know you have been too serious all your life . But you 're still young . Wake up ! You 're not goingto live this way much longer . I wo n't let you . " " No ? " said Joe . " Wait and see . I 've got to work harder than ever now . " " Come on , " said his wife . " Forget it . Let 's have a drink . " " All right . But do n't forget your mother 's coming and we 'll have to fix up a room for her . " " Yes , I can see her . I tell you I do n't want her here . I 'm only doing this for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to put her  --  except the little cubbyhole off the kitchen  --  but we 've got trunks and all kinds of junk there . That 's really a maid 's room . We need a maid . " " Yah , but not now . We 'll put one of the children in with us . " " There you go . Mind your own business . Forget it . Come on . I 'm going to drink to success for you . You can go to bed later . " P172A HOTEL ROOM iS a purgatorybetween desires , a window to leap from , a prison cell , the neatness of a well trimmed coffin , reminiscent of life  --  that was here last night , in this bed , a remainderseeking to keep some slight warmth to itself after that has passed by , disappeared . A few clean sheets , a new pillow case , the pillow knocked up to a resemblance of freshness by the old sour faced bedmaker  --  her eyes too indifferent to look for anything but pennies and dimes  --  especially dimes since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the pocket of the pants taken off carelessly , a good hairpin , used at once as she sweats and dusts and changes . Even the rain is n't more than dust here  --  except for its patter . Futile to rouse anything . No use more than to streak the already grimy windows  --  Why bother with anything ? thought Joe . For what ? Let them have it ? Especially when it is easily your own . That is the time to open the palms of the hands and let it slide away  --  so that the hands may be clean again . Empty . Clean . Empty . Joe looked out through the rain over the city of Washington and saw the dome of the Capitol . Barefooted in his underwear . This was the big day . Hard to imagine . Compared with the world of his imagination or even with the two , four , six , eight world of affairs , his own little business seemed as un/impressive to him , infantile even , as dirty socks on the back of a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lying there on that table , so that by reaching out my hand for it I should possess myself of the wealth of the world  --  I would n't stir a finger . I 'd shave and go down for breakfast . So he turned on the hot water in the basin and prepared to shave  --  or find some other pretext . It 's all right for some people though , without brains or consciences . If they did n't have money they would n't have any excuse for building churches . Somebody would have to crack their heads open with a hammer , make a crack in the bone . Then you could with a small piece of metal , a strong screw-driver would n't be a bad thing , pry it open a little and put some sense in . Take out the lever and it would close itself . Then they 'd know the value of money , and so forth . No use . You have to be an actor . You have to get all excited and make them think you want something desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your face , that you want money . Because it is important . That 's why . Because with money you can buy everything . Joe laughed out loud . You can buy everything ! Even a load of horse shit . He laughed . But if you do n't make a good show you disappoint people . They do n't think you know . They hate you . Yes they do , they hate you . You 're their enemy . You have to respect money . You owe it to them . You owe it to them because you 're sorry for them , you have to show them that they 're right . Money is , by God , valuable . It means everything . Then you have honored humanity and you do n't have to feel sorry for them . You do n't have to give a damn whether they . . . P174He cut himself trying to shave down into the sharp cleft of his chin . Joe did n't feel impressed . " Be at the White House offices at 9:45 . Your appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was signed by the Postmaster General himself . The President of the United States wanted to see him . Just to see me , said Joe . That 's all . He does n't believe me . He wants to see me . Then what will he know ? He is n't a woman to know by instinct what I am . Joe had read the papers . He knew what had taken place and the President 's attitude toward him . Roosevelthad been quoted as saying : " I do n't like this man Stecher . I do n't like his way of doing business . " Payne had been splendid , no question  --  but why ? It was n't particularly out of any good feeling or understandingof the situation . Not at all . Merely that the setup had put him , Payne , and his department , in a bad position . If he , Joe Stecher , had n't played his game so as to put the pressure on when its effect would be most telling  --  what chance would he have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyhow , that 's how it was and I know it . And those Associates ! Babes in the wood . Joe felt kindly toward them . What a lot of narren . They go about with their mouths open like children at a circus . You walk up to them and put a nickel in their mouths . They do n't even see you . And they begin to play a tune . And so earnest ! They know they are right . They are upholding the honor of the printer 's trade . Joe smiled to himself . But the bastards can make trouble . They made enough of it for me  --  without knowing what they were doing . P175He knew how the President had listened to them . It was all in the papers . The President of the United States had listened to them and told them that he was heartily in favor of what they had to say . Then the Postmaster General had wept , so the papers said . My business made the Postmaster General stand before the President of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyhow , sounds good . Why not a good healthy lie ? " Yes , Mr. President , you are completely right , " that 's what Joe wanted to say to the President when he met him . He wanted to look him in the eye and say , " Mr. President , you are right . You are always right . This Joe Stecher is a thief and a blackguard . I would cancel that contract for the money order blanks at once by executive order , no matter what it costs . Do n't trust him . Do n't let that man get away with his crooked business . And if you do n't believe me , " Joe would say , " you call the chief of the Money Order Division that you have so unjustly dismissed after his long service , call the officials of the Mohawk Press , they 'll tell you . This man Stecher is a crook . " While he said this , Joe would watch the President and he would see the look of self-satisfaction come to his face . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States of America rise up in power before him and he , Joe Stecher , would  --  laugh ! He 'd laugh till his back crumbled . But he must n't show it . I le 'd have to be a good poker player . He 'd stand there without a trace of feeling under his moustache , he 'd t hank the President for his insight and initiative and  --  go home and  --  well , all right . Better not mention it . Anyhow , whichever way you go , a man has to eat his breakfast once he 's shaved , dressed  --  his shoes !   My God he 'd better get a shine . Probably in the basementsomewhere . At 9:45 Joe presented his card at the Executive Offices , was told to go in and sit down . Took off his raincoat , his rubbers , stood his umbrella in the stand and took the newspaper from his pocket to read . A quick glance about was all he needed : an office like any other  --  with unimportant differences . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the President was saying . The Postmaster General was beside them . " Yes , Mr. President , " said Joe . " I saw that in the papers . " " You did . I did n't like your way of going about it . " " Mr. President , " broke in the Postmaster General . The President held up his hand . " But my friend Payne seems to believe in you . You 're said to be the ablest printer in the United States at this time , so I 've been given to believe . " Joe made no move . " Thank you , " he said . " I want to ask you a question . My policy has been  --  " Ah ha ! thought Joe . So that 's it . " It 's my policy to handle government work in governmentoffices , under direct government control whenever it is possible to do so . " Sounds nice ! thought Joe . " What 's that ? " " Nothing , " said Joe . " I did n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Printer , why is n't the Money Order business in his hands ? " There was a pause . " Well ? " said the President .   " Do you want my opinion , sir ? " asked Joe . " Yes , that 's what I asked you . " " He could n't print them , " said Joe . " Why not ? " " He has n't the equipment or the knowledge . " " We can get them , ca n't we ? We can get anything we need . " Joe had made up his mind not to speak unless he was asked a direct question . " Speak up , " said the President . " I want to know what you think . " " Yes , " said Joe , " you can get anything you want if you pay for it . But not in a day . " " Why not ? " " Because they do n't know how . " " How long do you suppose it would take to set up an efficient Printing Office in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort under our own power ? " " I could n't say , " said Joe . " But you must have an opinion . " " You mean on a business basis ? " " Yes . " " You could get a shop to turn out the blanks in three or four months , but maybe not before six months , I think , if you spent enough money on it , " said Joe . " I think you 're wrong , " said the President . " We could do it if we had to . Are you going to be able to get the blanks out on time ? " " Yes , sir , " said Joe . " You seem very certain of yourself , " said the President. be did not answer . " I say you seem very sure of yourself , " said the President .   " Yes , sir , " said Joe . " You think you 'll be able to have the orders out on time ? " " Yes , sir , " said Joe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will , " said the Postmaster General smiling in his kindly manner . " Well , Payne , " said the President , " I suppose that settles it . Perhaps you 've made the wise decision underthe circumstances . Good day , Gentlemen . " He held out his hand . Joe took it , famous flesh ! and withoutsmiling turned away . " Oh Payne , I want to see you for a moment , " said the President . The Postmaster General did n't look well . " Better take care of yourself , " said Joe to him before leaving . " That 's all right , Stecher . Glad you came , and best of luck . You 're all right . Goodbye , " and he held the door open for Joe to go out . Joe went , as cold and collected as if he were going out to buy a paper . So cold he could see the very hairs on the doorman 's eyebrows as he walked past him into the outer office . And that 's that , said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as simple as that . I wonder what he wanted to see me for . I suppose he just wanted to see me . Just to see what sort of a skunk I 'd turn out to be . Pot bellied , weasel snouted , peanut browed . A regular crook . I suppose he had me all figured out in his mind . A GREAT man . Poor fellow . Joe did n't like him . Too much noise , big ideas . Well , if you think that way then pretty soon you 're going to begin to haveP179to be successful whether you like it or not . Then you 'll have to begin to make a few pretty excuses to yourself , just to make it work . Then you 're going to have to invent a few convenient lies to cover up the failures . I would n't want him in my shop . Not in my shop . He 'd find all kinds of excuses for not doing what I told him to do . Good excuses too . He sat down to put on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his hat in hand and went out . It was raining as hard as ever . Opening his umbrella he walked from the Executive offices to the street down the splashed sidewalk . No use sending a wire this time . Pack and go home . That 's over with . And what of it ? So that was the business of the United States . Pretty small business , but very differentwhen you see it than when you read about it in the papers . What but some men , with women on their necks half the time , trying to find out what the other fellow 's thinking . And what do they get when they get through ? Anything accurate ? Anything really thoughtful ? Anything even just ? Never . Just a vague : approximation . My policy . The policy of the government . Yah ! said Joe . Go lay an egg . What does a policy do ? What work does it do ? It does plenty . It uproots everything in its path . You make up your mind you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do n't care anything more about it . You do n't even look . You plow straight ahead , flowers , birds ' nests , men , lives , opportunities  --  oh well . No point to that . You have to plow . But he came back to it . No , there 's more to it than that . That 's not all . You stop paying attentionP180to the truth of the detail . You do n't look to see whether that man is an honest man , whether he 's doing the job well or ill . All you care about is , My policy . Let the government do the public printing , a " long range " policy . Hum ! grunted Joe . Up in the hotel room he looked at his right hand , opened it and closed it a few times . Now you 've got to pick up your shaving things and your dirty underwear , he said to it . Come on , get busy . You ca n't shake Presidents ' hands all day . Get to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He walked to the station through the rain to save the hack fare . He had plenty of time though  --  with his small black satchel in his hand . He sat in the smoking car by the window and watched the landscape all afternoon , drenched with rain , the trees in and about Washington still in full leaf , thinner and thinner as he rode northward and across New Jersey  --  still raining  --  toward evening . A few desolate cows , the winter wheat up here and there a green grain  --  but miles and miles of useless land . He never could make that out . Why is n't it cleared of brush and cultivated  --  as it would be in Germany ? My policy ! what else ? My policy . Nothing works efficiently any more because of that idea . Church , government  --  the only thing that works is one man that pays attention to what he is doing and knows what to do about it . My brother plays the violin in Prague . My sister shows her legs on the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our jobs all right . Because if we do n't  --  It 's because it 's to the advantage of someoneor other , my policy !  --  or we 'd plant as much asP181we want and need and we 'd have a world worth living in . Waste , waste , waste . There 's the solution to everything . Just cultivate that land , just that little bit of acreage of New Jersey , just as far as you can see on both sides of this train window , that is going to waste . That 's all you have to do . But really use it . And there 'd be no more poverty or misery in the entire world  --  Just put it to use . They have n't the intelligence . And they 're too lazy and smug and  --  stupid . That 's all that 's the matter . Anybody could solve the troubles of the world in fifteen minutes  --  if people had good will  --  and somebody was n't preventing it , for a profit . And for the satisfaction of establishing " my policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in big letters for tobacco money to some stupid farmer . Joe shook his head . He detested farmers . Horrible . And nobody can stop it . What 's public opinion ? 1 ) o you know what public opinion is ? It 's  --  why ai n't I gettin ' more of it ? That 's what public opinion is . I wonder how many million people a year look out of a window every year between New York and Philadelphiaand not one , not a single one , sees for one split second what is right before them as plain as your nose on your face . Never . They never see anythingsimple . It 's all right there  --  but they do n't know it . They 're too important . They know too much . ' They 're legislators , statesmen , big business executives , w omen !  --  they do n't know anything  --  except what they 're told . Am I any better ? What do I do ? I get all excited about printing a few blanks for postal money orders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do one little thing straight  --  like playing the violin . At least I know that .

But do they know what it means , that he plays well ? Do they ? Not one of them . They do n't know what excellence means . No , not one of them . They simply do n't know that it means to do one thing well . The rest  --  ? To do it well . Honestly . Every day . And never to lie . Never . What good would it do for an artist to lie to a piano or to a violin ? No good at all . But they want to play the violin by telling it that " my policy " is to play the violin standing on my head or sitting in a bathtub , or  --  while I 'm eating .

Congratulations were in order ! " Many thanks , " said Joe . " Glad you dropped in . " This was n't a formal party , just Melquist and his wife Martha , whom everybody loved , old friends of the Stechers , Auntie Olga , old Captain Ostland and his lady , Joe , Gurlie and Grandma , who had come to live with them awhile now , though she could hear very little of what was said . " Now tell us , Joe , what really happened , " said Melquist . " We 're all friends together here . I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better talker than I am , " said Joe , smiling across the table . " That 's all past history . lie 's got a better memory than I have for things likea t . " " What really happened , Gurlie ? Who got the idea f bidding for the money order contract first ? Was itII ? It sounds like you . " He looked straight into Gurlie 's eyes . Gurlie laughed and looked down . " Sure , I did it . "   " Is that right , Joe ? " He turned his head toward Joe again . " Yes , that 's right , " said Joe , tipping the ashes off his cigar . " That 's the inside story . As right as most things you hear . " " But that does n't answer me , " went on Melquist . " They 've been saying some pretty damaging things about you in the papers , Stecher . " " That 's right , " said Joe . " If you read it in the papers , it 's true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't mean that , but you know , people believe things like that . Some people . " " Well , " said Joe , " some people will always believe anything they hear  --  or read . It takes all kinds of people to make a world . " Gurlie laughed without reason . " But I hear it around and I do n't like it . I want to hear the truth for once and then I can answer questionsand believe me I will answer questions , " he shook his head determinedly , " once I know what I 'm talking about . " " That 's right , " said Gurlie to her husband , " tell him the whole thing . " " From the beginning , " said Melquist . " How did it start ? " Gurlie sat back while the others leaned forward in their chairs the better to hear . " Why do n't you start an honest newspaper , " said Joe looking at his cigar again , " then I can sell you the story and make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melquist . " Come on . " " Come on , Joe , tell us . "   " Aw come on , Joe , " they all said , " we want to know the truth . " " You been reading the papers , what more is there to say ? They know everything , even things that never happened and five or six versions of the same thing . What 's the difference what I say ? I do n't know my own business . I refuse to talk ! " He stuck his chin out with a coarse bluffing gesture . They all laughed . " Come on Joe . " " All right , if you promise you wo n't tell the papers , 1 ' 11 tell you . " He looked around the circle . " Pour us a drink , Gurlie . Come on . Es lebe die Wahrheit ! The truth conquers all things . What is Truth ? In vino veritas . Austrinken . Cross my heart and hope to die , believe it or not . Skol ! " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah ! " " Aw come on Joe , quit stalling . " " What 's interesting in all this ? It 's happened and is over with . A lie is so much more saleable . To the honor of the Fourth Estate the great profession of journalism ! Give us this day our daily lie and let us have space ! Amen . " " Du dumme ! " said his wife . " What 's the matter with you ? " She looked at him hard . That sobered him a little . " So you want to know the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help me God . " He twirled his moustache with his heft thumb and forefinger and seemed to be thinkinghow to begin . " That 's it , Joe , what happened ? " Well  --  " then he stopped . " Gurlie has been tellingme for years to strike the Boss for a raise  --  " " Do n't try to be funny , " said his wife shifting inp186her chair , picking up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . " So finally I asked him for more money . ' I got to have more money , ' I told him . " Joe burlesqued it , scowling heavily . He paused and lit a cigar . " All right . Then what happened ? " " They fired me , " said he and stopped short . " Now , Joe . After all , if you do n't want to tell us I do n't want to bother you . " Melquist looked at Gurlie a little miffed , as much as to say , " What does he mean ? " " He 's got to tell you now , " said Gurlie , " or I will . This is your last chance , " she said to her husband . " Are you going to talk seriously or not ? " " Or not , " said Joe . " I 'll tell them the truth . " " That 's fine , " said Melquist . " Yes , that 's sweet of you , Joe , " said Martha . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as Gurlie knew , and she had been engaged once to Joe 's brother Oswald . " Well , last April we got word from Washington that the bids for the new money order contract would be advertised in June . We 've been doing them for the past sixteen years  --  I beg pardon , " he stopped short as though scandalised , " the newspapers said twenty years  --  for the past twenty years . So the Boss asked me to be ready to figure them again this time . It was no secret . " " That comes under his department , the lithographingdepartment , " said Gurlie explaining . " That 's his job for the past fifteen or sixteen years . Nobody else could do it . " " Yes , I know , " said the old captain who had n't found anything to say until that time .   " Twenty years , do n't forget , " said Joe . " So I told him that I had to have more money . I have to have more money ! ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My family is growing up and I want to get a house in the country . ' " " What happened ? " " He told me that if I 'd figure their bid on the money order contract , the biggest single item in the shop at the time , he said he 'd consider giving me a raise afterward . Smart fellow . " " Just a trick , " broke in Gurlie . " But believe me , if I had n't warned him , he 'd have believed it . He did n't believe me at first , he 's too honest and he thinks everybody else is honest . " She spoke loud and confidently , punctuating her remarks with sharp laughter . " I 've been telling him for years it is n't so . Hagh ! How could people get rich the way they do if they did it honestly ? They do n't work for it and they have no brains , bejabbers , you can see that plain . They know the tricks , hagh ! that 's all . But he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know people . " " Who 's telling this story , " said her husband , " you or me ? " " You 're trying to tell it , " said his wife vigorously in his face . " I quit , " said Joe . " No , no , " said Melquist . " Do n't quit . " He appealedwith his eyes to Gurlie . " Leave him alone Gurlietill he finishes . " " I mean I quit the job . " Everybody laughed . " I had a feeling that things were n't the way I like to see them in the shop , too many young fellows living off the contracts . I saw through a couple of things  --  after about twenty years , " he added smiling , lookingP188at his wife . " Year in and year out even a dummkopf notices things finally you know . And I could see in the old man 's eye that he knew I knew what was going on . I guess he figured I 'd been there too long . So I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give me a raise before I figured the contract or I 'd have to quit right there . " " How did he like that ? " said Olga pinching up her lips in anticipation . " He asked me if I was trying to hold him up . I told him no but that I 'd rather quit before the contract was figured for my own protection . I was tired any-way . " " But the newspapers said you knew  --  " " No ! " said Joe , throwing out his chest in mock earnest , " after ten , no , sixteen , no , twenty years  --  I 'm so dumb , I do n't know what I 'm talking about . Especiallysince I wrote the specifications myself . " " You mean the government specifications ? You say you wrote them ? " " Sure , " said Joe , puffing his cigar . " Is that right , Gurlie ? " Melquist was incredulous . " Yes , that 's right . " " Sure , " said Joe . " She says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department did n't know how to figure it himself so he asked me . He wanted to be sure he had somebody that knew the business . " " Well , I 'll be damned , " and Melquist sat back in his chair and looked about the table from one to the other as much as to say , " Can you believe it ? " They all shook their heads seriously from side to side . " I 'll be damned , " he repeated . " Go ahead , " said Joe . " But I did not figure the bid of the Mohawk Press in spite of what has been said . I knew what their bid would be without figuring it . I knew what both their bids would be . I quit . " " Yes , " broke in Gurlie again . " If he had done what they asked him to , once they got out of him what they wanted  --  they 'd kick him out anyway . Then it would be too late . They knew what he was worth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , I quit . And what do you think happened ? " Joe began warming up a little and his face showed it . " I do n't know . " " I tried to get a job with another concern but I could n't get a job anywhere . And after all , if you do n't get the kind of job I was used to in New York , Philadelphia or Boston  --  where are you ? I went everywhereand could n't find anything . " " They blacklisted him , " said Gurlie . " Is that right , Stecher ? " " Yes , that 's right , " said Joe . " I 'll be damned . " " So , " Gurlie went on , " I told him , ' All right , start your own business . You know the money order blank business . You put in a bid for it . I 'll help you . I 'll live poor , I 'll eat dirt . I 'll do anything , ' " Gurlie pounded her fist on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , we did n't have to eat dirt , " said Joe calming her . " But you ca n't start a business on a shoestring . I tell you I was pretty lucky . If I had n't had the right kind of backers I never would have got anywhere . " Gurlie laughed out loud . " He 's crazy , " she said . " I le never wants to have anybody believe he has anydins or any ability or anything . Do you think he had to ask or beg for anybody to back him ? I should say not . They came to him and begged HIM to accept their backing . Those men knew what they were deal-P190ing with . He never told anybody , not even me . Do you suppose there is anybody else like him in New York ? Those men were smart , " and she screwed up her eyes as if to put a look of extreme shrewdness in her features . " Who were they , Joe ? " said Melquist all attention . There was a hush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They told me they 'd give me the printing for the Chase National Bank and the New York Central tickets and  --  " " Whew ! Now you 're talking . Platt and Depew , huh ? That 's different . I knew there must be ... " " Yes , but that was only after I 'd bid on the money orders . " " When did all this take place ? " " Last summer . " " But the papers said you did figure the contract for the Mohawk Press and then you quit and figured under them . They said that you figured both contracts and that you had inside information . " " Sure , " said Joe , " I had inside information , plenty of it . I know how to do it . They did n't , that 's why they lost . " " But the newspapers  --  " " Yah ! If I had figured their bid and if they thought I was going to bid , as they did , do you suppose they were such damn fools as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  after I had resigned two months earlier ? " " But the newspapers said  --  " " The newspapers be damned , " said Joe . " I have the letters of the chief of the Money Order Division of the Post Office Department in safe keeping . TheyP191tried to get them away from me but I have them as evidence . " " Yes , I saw you threatened suit if they did n't stop their slander . " " And what happened ? Did they press the case ? No . They quit like the dirty yellow dogs they are . They quit ! " said Joe with furious but controlled emphasis , " Those were my letters and would n't they have liked to get their hands on them . " " Take it easy , Joe , " said Mrs. Melquist , the sweet and charming . " You must n't get him excited , Melquist . Do n't get so serious , Joe . Come on  --  smile . " Joe smiled and took a drink . " Well , I guess that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should say not , " said Melquist . " After they found tat you were the successful bidder , then what ? Oh es , what was all this about the Associates ? Who were they and what did they want ? " " A lot of fools , " said Joe . " They 're ex-managersr extinct printing houses with nothing else to do ut run to the President of the United States and Ilyache to him about me . The Boss sent his man tossman to them to BEG them to protest  --  to the resident of the United States ! mind you  --  not to let crook like me have the job . And they did go and they convinced him . Such a petty affair . " " Yes , I saw something of that . What was it they did ? " " ' They attacked my business methods , and that 's here the newspaper campaign against me started . Iwas a traitor . I learned my trade at a certain office andthen turned against it . Pugh ! It would encourage employeesin other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss ! It 's illegal ! It 's bad morals ! That 's what they sent Grossman to say to those charming gentlemen in convention assembled at Atlantic City  --  to keep the trade pure ! Get that young printer Stecher ! Get him ! The bosses went groveling on their knees to their own labor to get me kicked out when they could n't do it any other way ... " " Were you a member of the union ? " " No , " said Joe . " I gave up my union membership years ago at their insistence to hold my job . They know that . And so they 're using it against me now . What do they mean , I want to run an open shop ? I do n't run a shop of any kind , yet . That 's the kind of thing that gets the public ear  --  and is even believed at the top sometimes . And somebody is usually paid to have it so . They would n't permit me to be a member of the union . But that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't and the only reason they wanted to get those people to testify in Washington against my character was to protect their own crookedness  --  and those weak-minded gentlemen fell for it like the simpletons they were . I felt sorry for them . Fine representatives of labor they were ! They have nothing to do so they represent labor ! " " Then what ? " " Then , when they found they could n't beat me that way , the fun really started . That 's where I proved myself to be a crook . I had them down . And they howled like stuck pigs . Haw , haw , haw , haw ! " laughed Joe sardonically . " But first they fell in love with me , " he added . " Anybody would fall in love with you , Joe , " said Mrs. Melquist . He blushed crimson .   " What are you trying to do to my husband ? " said ( ; urlie militantly . " Oh you know I do n't mean anything , Gurlie , " said her friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gurlie , " now that we 're going to be rich . " " Why Gurlie , you 're terrible . Such a fool  --  I mean . Why Gurlie . " " Will you women shut up , " said Melquist seriously . " I want to hear the rest of it . So they wanted to take you back into the firm ? Yes , I remember reading that . by did n't you go ? Would n't it have saved trouble ? ou did n't even feel sure you had the contract  --  " " How long do you suppose I would have lasted ? ' hey were scared . They 'd promise anything , but how nig do you think that would have been . Caldwell as the first to ask me to make up with them . That 's hat really decided me . Then I knew where I stood . el ore that I was n't certain . " Joe quit talking so Gurlie took it up . " They did everything to catch him in something , " said she . hey even sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let out a little scream and looked beIndher . " Did you see him ? " " I caught him , " said Gurlie . " Is that right ? " said Melquist . " ' That 's right , " said Joe . " She caught him and called for the neighbors . " You were brave , " said Melquist . " Who was he ? as he young ? " " A nice young man , " said Gurlie . " They had sent and he was looking through that desk . " " You do n't mean it ? "   " They did everything to make him give up his contract and to come in with the old firm . " " That 's how stupid they were , " said Joe . " Can you imagine it ? The Chief of the Money Order Departmentwas attempting to defraud the government by discarding the lowest bid and giving the contract to a higher bidder . He was the go between  --  he arrangeda meeting between the Boss and myself in Washington  --  to defraud the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " said Melquist . " And they tried to trick him , " said Gurlie . " They tried to say he wanted to sublet the contract , which was against the law . But the truth is they sent other firms to ask him and to urge him to let them do the work for him  --  on purpose to catch him and have his bid thrown out . " " Oh , oh ! " said Mrs. Melquist . " But the newspapers , " said Joe "  --  I do n't know what they got for it  --  printed the story that I , knowingthe law , was such an ass as to have myself thrown out . " " He had no shop you see , " said Gurlie . " Oh I see , " said Melquist . " He had no shop set up ... " " They asked me to save myself all the trouble of setting up a new shop . " " What did they offer you as an inducement ? " " Sixty dollars a week and 5% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How much would that have amounted to ? Quite a bit , I imagine . " " About $20,000 a year . " " And you turned it down , Joe ? " " Sure . "   " Was that right ? " said Mr. Melquist . " Ha ! that 's nothing , " said Gurlie . " Wait and see . " hat 's right , " said Joe . " Wait and see . Make a million ! " " But you had them in your hands by that time , " id Melquist . " Yes , " said Joe . " I knew they were guilty . " " And you wanted to punish them . " " No . I wanted to be let alone to go ahead . " " Well I do n't know , Joe  --  " " Pugh ! " said Gurlie . " What do you know anyway . " hat 's my little Dutchie , he 's going to make me a rich ' than . " " Sure , " said Joe turning away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Money is everything in this country , " said Gurlie . " What do you want to be rich for , are n't you satisfied - with what you 've got ? " " What do I want to be rich for ! What do you want live for ? Of course I 'm not satisfied with what I 've . I want to go places , " Gurlie was loud and serious , " I want to see everything there is to see that I'mrested in . He does n't want anything , " she jerkedhead at her husband , " that 's why he needs me. ' d be satisfied to walk around in the woods by himself , he never sees anything . I 'm different . What do u mean , why do I want to be rich ? You know better an that . I want to go to the theatre and sit in the %t seats  --  where I have never sat more than once or t. c . I want to go to a good restaurant afterward  --  I want to  --  everything ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed aloud . " You 'd get sick of it . "   " Sure I 'd get sick of it . Then I 'd do something else  --  if I was rich . But now I ca n't do anything . I want to get rid of these kids  --  " Oh Gurlie . " " Sure I want to get rid of these kids . Who would n't want to if he was n't a liar . I want to go when I feel like it and have a fine place  --  with fine flowers I can pick and smell . " " You can have that now . Flowers do n't cost so much . But what good are such things without children . I long so for a child . " " Why do n't you adopt one then if you ca n't have one , " said Gurlie laughing her loud derisive laugh that you could hear a block away if the windows were open . " Sure I 'd like a son and I 'll have one when I get ready  --  not now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't care about the money  --  but I want what it can buy . Everybody wants money . Why lie about it ? " " Everybody is n't like that , Gurlie . That is n't true . What is money ? There 's no happiness in money , only misery and you lose all the lovely things of life . " " Yes , if you 're foolish . I 'm not such a fool . When I have money I 'm going to spend it , I 'm not a miser . " " Poor Joe , " said Martha . " No , you 're no miser , that 's right , " said her husband . " If you spend it , you wo n't have it long , " said Joe smiling . " Agh , " said Gurlie , " you do n't know what you 're talking about . All you 're good for is work . You need me to put some life into you . Where would you be without me ? " " In the soup , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be without you , Joe ? " said Martha . Joe smiled but said nothing . " Where would I be ? " laid Gurlie . " I tell you where I 'd be . I 'd be where I 'd %%ant to be no matter where it was . And I 'd have more money maybe than I have now . " " You have n't got any now , " said Joe . " But I will have . You wait and see . " P198WHEN GURLIE LEFT thehouse to join Joe down town , she had insisted that he should not go alone . She left her mother with the two children in the front room . " Where are you going ? " said the old woman . " We are going to see the men he used to work for . They want to talk to him . " " And what will you do there ? That 's for the men . " " Huh ! " said Gurlie . " I 'd like to see anybody keep me away . Joe needs me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Pff ! " said her mother . " You always had more imagination than was good for you . Why do n't you take care of your house and let the men mind their own business ? " " This is my business . I may not be back for lunch , " said Gurlie . " Goodbye , " said her mother . " Good luck anyhow . I do n't understand it but if Joe wants you I suppose you 'd better go . " " He has nothing to say about it , " concluded her daughter and went out . The baby was stumbling about the floor in her usual way but when the door slammed she stopped and pointing to it said , " Mammie aw gone ! " and shook her head vigorously from side to side . The old woman looked at her without smiling , picked her up and buckled her into her walking chair . There theP199baby stood stock-still seeming to realize for the first time that here was a newcomer in the household . The old lady was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head from side to side . The baby did the same . Down town Gurlie met Joe in front of the premises n Center St. as arranged , where he told her at once ' hat had happened . " I 've got to find another place . %e been notified by the building inspector that the doors here are n't strong enough to hold the presses . " " Is it true ? " said Gurlie . " No , " said Joe . " But I ca n't prove it . And I have n't Ot time if I could . You got here in time , for a hange , " he said to his wife . " You said quarter to ten , so here I am . " They walked down the street together , she wanting take his arm and he pulling away . " Na , na , na ! one of that . " So they went on side by side , she want-g to talk and he putting her off as much as he could . " What do they want with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't want you to come . now for heaven 's sake do n't make a fool of youra11 . Listen and that 's all . Do n't talk . " " Huh , you did n't want me to come ! Oh no ! I noticed you did n't try to stop me when I said I refused let you go alone  --  to a hotel . " " Nonsense . " " You remember what they did to you last year . I appose you think you can beat anybody . Let them y it today . " " Well , a witness never hurts . " " How far is it ? " " Not very far . And remember , do n't talk . Let me the talking . "  |p200At  ten sharp they arrived at the entrance to the hotel , not an impressive place  --  as Gurlie seemed to think it would be  --  but just a facade in the block east of Broadway , the name Hotel Fortway , in gold on the glass of the main entrance . The lobby was empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nobody said Aye or Nay to them as they stood there for a moment adjusting their eyes to the lack of light . " Where are we going ? " said Gurlie . " There 's the elevator . " Joe pushed the button and only then did the clerk at the desk accost them . " Can I help you ? " he said . " I want to see Mr. Wynnewood . " " Oh , this Mr. Stecher ? I think he 's expecting you . The boy will direct you to his room , " and he came out from behind the desk and rang the bell himself . They went up , the elevator boy looking sharply at Joe as he let them off at the sixth floor and pointed to the left , " Number i6 . " Joe led the way . The door opened as they approached it . Mr. W. was getting up hurriedly to greet them . " How are you , Stecher ? " he said in an apparently cheerful mood , but when he saw Gurlie he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Eh , eh , eh , " he said . " My wife , " said Joe . " How do you do , " said Gurlie . " I 'm Mr. Wynnewood , " said the Boss . " How do you do , Mrs. Stecher . I had no idea  --  Wo n't you come in ?  --  I did n't know you were  --  " he said to Joe . " No , " said Joe . Inside there were several men seated about the room , they all got to their feet at once and were introduced to Gurlie who smiled her best smiles and bowed to each one in turn as Mr. Wynnewood namedP201them . Then there ensued an embarrassed moment . Nobody quite expected this move on Joe 's part . The Boss cleared his throat and looked hard at Joe . " Eh , " he said , " suppose you and I , Stecher , go downstairs --  said Joe sharply . " We 'll stay here . " " Oh , " said the Boss . Mr. Blake , the lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wanted to have a little personal talk with Mr. Stecher . But I can see no harm in his wife 's being present . I understand how he must feel in the matter . I think he 's quite right . " " Oh you do , eh , " said the old man . " Well . All right . I suppose you know your husband 's business as well as he does , Mrs. Stecher , " he laughed . " You look it . No doubt he tells you what goes on . So let 's sit down and get to work . " " Why do n't you come back into the firm with us , Stecher ? " said the old man directly and at once . " You 'll do us a great favor . I 'm putting it up to you man to man . We need you . You know there is n't anybody here or anywhere else who can take your place . This thing has gone too far . " There was a pause . " Well , what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Joe . He looked the old man quietly in the eye and said he did n't think he wanted to come back . " Why not ? " said the old man . " I know you need pore money . I acknowledge I 've been a little bit hard ended about that , but you 've shown me up . I know when I 'm licked , " and he tried to laugh but did n't o very well . " You 've taught me something , Stecher , . and I 'm glad to acknowledge it . Come back with us.  |p202and  I 'll be a different man to you . Name your own price . You wo n't find many opportunities such as this one . Forgive and forget . What do you say ? " Again a pause . Joe waited a full minute before answering . " No , " he said . " But then why did you come here at all ? " broke in Mr. Blake . " You must have had something in your mind to say to us or you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " said Joe . " I wanted to come here fair and square . I wanted to see if we could n't come to some kind of an understanding so I can go on and do business in New York without being molested . " " What 's that ! " " What do you mean by that , Stecher . Mr. Stecher ? What do you mean by that ? " " I did n't ask to come here , " said Joe . " You asked me to come . So I came . If that 's all you want of me , I 'll go now . " " No you do n't , " said the old man getting up . Joe was standing but Gurlie had n't moved yet . She was too fascinated . " What wo n't I do ?

" You know me , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at heart I 'm not the sort of man people believe me . You realize that you 've got me into a tight fix . Here we are , young Caldwell and me , indicted for grand larceny .

You ca n't be entirely without a heart . What are you going to do to help us ? Man to man , now , get over these stiff-necked ideas of yours . We 're not a bunch of crooks . We 're businessmentrying to earn a living the same as you . What are we going to do , cut each other 's throats ? " Gurlie was looking at Joe . He could see her out of the corner of his eye . " Will you let me talk ? " said Joe . " Certainly , certainly , " said the old man . " That 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to come here . Tell us . " " In the first place , " said Joe , " I want to thank you personally for all you 've done for me during the years I was employed by the Mohawk Press . " " Do n't mention it , " said the old man . " You have always given Inc a free hand in my department , " Joe went on , " and trusted me the way I expected to be trusted . I wassatisfied there  --  Well , I have no hard feelings and if you will let me go about my own business , I 'll do everything I can to help Mr. Caldwell . " " That 's beside the point , " said the old man . " Wait a minute , J. W. , " said his lawyer . " Let Mr. echer finish . " " Yes , let him finish what he has to say , " said Gurlie . Everybody looked at her , Joe annoyed , the othersn mild amusement or astonishment , but she stared right back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , what have you to say , Stecher ? " " I do n't want to be molested in my plans to set up business here in this city . " " Who 's molesting you ? " ' " That 's my own business , " said Joe . " I have no personal feeling against you , Mr. Wynnewood or against any of you other gentlemen . " " Then why did you bring this mess about ? " " Now , J. W. , " broke in his lawyer . " Let me speak to Mr. Stecher . " " I 'll thank you to keep out of this , " said Joe to the lawyer . " Mr. Wynnewood and I can say anything we have to say to each other without your assistance . " Everybody looked at Joe in amazement , especially Gurlie , whose eyes grew round in her head . " You know perfectly well , " continued Joe to his old boss , " that I had as much right to bid on that contract as you had . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did it , " said the old man warming up , " you could say that . But I deny  --  " he stopped short . " I was not employed by you when I submitted my bid , " said Joe . " No , but that 's only a technicality and you know it . You knew what we would bid . You yourself laid down the specifications . " " I had nothing to do with your bid , " said Joe . " Again , that 's technically true , " said the old man . " But you know damn well  --  excuse me , Mrs. Stecher  --  that you did know what our bid would be . " " Certainly I knew what it had to be , " said Joe . " That 's why I bid against you . " " At last you 're coming out with the truth , " said the old man . " When did I ever say anything else ? " said Joe . " That 's dirty business , " said the old man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why did n't you come out into the open and tell me you were going to put in a bid on the contract ? P205Then it would have been a fair fight . You did n't have the guts to do it , that 's why , " said the old man . " What would you have done if I had ? " said Joe . " We 'd have cut our figure  --  " Joe smiled . " That 's why I did n't tell you , " said he . " You 've got your nerve with you , " said the old titan . " You come in and take all our training , all our methods , all our private knowledge  --  " " I take nothing out of your business that I did n't bring into it myself a hundred times over , " said Joe . " And what you paid I gave you back in services with interest , for a greater part of the best years of my life . Now I 'm through with you , do you understand that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man . " Damned if you are and do n't you think it . You did n't have to smear our personal reputations to win your dirty little contract away from us . You could n't have done it in any other way . You did n't have to do that and you wo n't get away with it without paying  --  " " I beg your pardon , J. W. , " broke in his lawyer gain . " Mind your own business , " said the old man . " Mind you , " he went on to Joe , " we do n't have to lay dirty . We do n't need court proceedings to get justice in this city . You 've gone about as far as a man can go and keep out of jail to put us in wrong . You 've blackened our names , stolen our business  --  Now I 'm going to tell you some things that you 'd better do , and o them quick , " said the old man , " if you want to establish your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to return us those letters you stole  --  " " Take that back , " said Joe .   " Whose letters were they then ? " " They were my letters , addressed to me personally by the Chief of the Money Order division asking me , as a favor , to assist him in drawing up the specificationsfor the contract . " " You were employed by this firm at the time . " " That had nothing to do with it , " said Joe . " I demand those letters . And I tell you to go to the First Assistant Postmaster General  --  your friend !  --  in Washington and tell him to lay his hands off me . I do n't care what friends you have  --  the Devil himself for all I care  --  but I tell you to cut out this campaign of denigration  --  mud slinging . I tell you to do this before it 's too late . " " Well , I tell you , " said Joe , " just this . I 'm starting to print money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next Monday . " " Where 's your shop , " said the old man . " And where are your presses ? " Joe looked at him for a moment as if he were going to say something but then changed his mind . " And , " he went on , " I shall expect you to deliver the steel forms for the lithographic plates to me as soon as I send you the address . " " Oh you do , eh . Well , let me tell you one more thing  --  " " No , " said Joe . " You wo n't . I did n't come here to be told anything by you or what I 'm to do . " " You sit down there , " said the old man to him menacingly . At this Gurlie got up . " Come on , " said Joe to her . " You 're not leaving this place , " said the old man , " until I  --  " " Go on , " said Joe to Gurlie . " Stop him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " God damnP207you to hell , " raved the old man as Joe went out the door . " You 'll pay for this . " Joe rang for the elevator where he stood silently with Gurlie while they waited for it to come creeping and rattling up the shaft to them . The elevator boy was expressionless , looking at Joe 's white face as they went down together . He opened the door and Joe and Gurlie walked away . Out into the street they went and headed toward Broadway . Neither said a word . " Go on home , " said Joe when they got to the corner of 18th St. " I got some more work to do down here . " " No , I 'm going to stay with you  --  and have lunch , " said she . " I do n't want any lunch , " said Joe . " I 've got to go down town . " " What for ? " " I want to go out and see about the presses . " " What about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go on home . I 'll see you later . " He signaled for a trolley and pushed Gurlie into it , turning away almost at once and heading down town .   THE OLD LADY went aboutthe rooms of the house taking it all in , the first time she had had to do so since she came there the week before . She found Gurlie not to be a good housekeeper , as she suspected . " Nana ! " called Lottie from the front of the house . " I want a pair of scissors . " Now the old lady really spoke nothing but Norwegian . She knew the names of many things in Englishbut that was about all . " Scissors ? No , no , " she said . " Not for little girls , " but that part of it was in a strange language and Lottie looked at her as she had been doing for the past few days , very much puzzled . " I want to cut out some pictures , " she yelled to make herself better understood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't yell so loud . Pictures ? Oh , you want scissors to cut out picturesfrom the magazine . You 'll have to wait for your mother to come home for that . I have nothing to say around here . " The little girl understood not a word of it . By that time Lottie went and brought the scissors which the old lady took away from her . Louie could n't understand . She looked at the old lady as if she were crazy . At that there was a noise from the kitchen . Grandma in her partial deafness did n't hearP209it but Lottie did . " The baby is in the kitchen , " Lottie said to distract attention from herself . " What ? " said the old lady . Lottie did n't know what to make of it all . So she went toward the hall and pointed . The old lady followed her . The noises from the kitchen continued . Lottie stopped and Grandma went past her . When she did that Lottie returned to the front room , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the old lady reached the kitchen door , Flossie , beside the kitchen table in her little wheelabout , was putting her hand up as high as she could , her fingers just touching the edge of a teacup there which she could n't quite grasp . The old lady stood and watched her . Flossie reached up with all her length , standing on tiptoe , but she was just too short for it , all she could do was to touch the cup and with each touch push it a little farther away from her . At that moment she turned and saw the old lady watching her . She was frozen at once to attention , the two remaining poised there studying each other . Then the baby smiled , a forced , affected smile . No response . Then she grew serious , watching her grandmotherfor several seconds . Then she frowned . And then her face became a study . She put on an appearance of tremendous surprise , opening her eyes wide and puckering her lips as though she were going to whistle . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes and the whole face . Finally she stopped her monkeyshinesand looked up at the cup , clasping her hands together dramatically . She smiled then , a naturalsmile , as much as to say , Oh , well ! and went off out of the old lady 's range of vision for a moment , coming back at once with a ball she had gathered top210herself somewhere , offering it by way of propitiation . " Bawl " she said . " Bawl " " Bawl Yes , bawl " said the old lady . " But you 're a naughty little girl just the same . You 'll break that cup . " Flossie pushed herself over to the table and reached up with one hand looking at her grandmotherthe while . She did n't say anything , just remainedthat way with her hand up while looking at the old lady questioningly . " You want something to eat ? " Flossie took her hand down and grinned , for no reason at all other than that she had been spoken to . " All right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread and butter . But do n't ask for anything else because that 's all you can have . " And she cut a piece of bread and buttered it for the little girl . " There ! " The old lady put the sandwich , for she had folded the bread over so that the butter side was doubled inward away from little fingers , into the baby 's hands . " Stay here and eat it , " she said , " do n't follow me , " and went into the front room . There was Lottie with the scissors . And after a moment or two the baby came clattering along from the back of the house , knocking her little walker wildly about in her career . " Uk , uk ! " she said waving the uneaten bread about in front of her . She had carefully opened the folded slice and licked every trace of butter from the inner surface . " Uk , uk ! " she said . Her grandmother was disgusted . So the day wore on . When Gurlie came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat , threw it aside anywhere and floppedP211into a chair . " Whew , " she said and began to look around . " The children have been terrible , " said her mother to her in Norwegian . " Such disobedient children . They drive a person crazy . " It was a bad time to begin that way . Furthermore , at that moment , Flossie , who had been severely spoken to by the old lady a moment before , began to cry . " What have you been doing to them while I 've been away ? " said Gurlie getting up to remove her coat which she threw across a chair . " Stop it , " she said to Flossie , " you have nothing to cry for . " Joe and the old lady always got along well together , but not Gurlie , though it was her own mother . Joe liked the old gal and made every allowance for her age ; perhaps in his mind he felt that a home required something of the sort to give it authority . Anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And she , while not understanding him , treated him always with respect , a simple straightforward acceptance of him as master of the house  --  a feeling inbred no doubt from her childhood days in the old country . " I 'm hungry , " said Gurlie going into the bedroom to tidy herself up a little . " Did you fix lunch ? " " No , " said the old lady . " I told you to fix something , " said her daughter . " You said nothing of the sort , " replied her mother . " But what about the children ? " " I was going to take care of the children now . " " Oh , " said Gurlie in English , " you 're impossible . " " What is that ? " " Leave me alone , " said the daughter . " What good are you ? " The old lady went over to where Lottie had been playing earlier and began to pick up the little pieces of paper littered about over the carpet .   " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We can sweep that up later . " " Well , what shall I do then ? " " Sit down , " said Gurlie , " and keep out of the way . " " Yes , I 'm for your convenience , " said her mother , " when you want to go out . But otherwise , Keep out of my way . ' What do you think I am ? I ca n't live that way . " She was angry by now . Gurlie had left her and gone to the kitchen . " There 's no love in this house , " the old lady flung after her daughter . Old Mrs. Torlund , even barring present incitements , was an extremely grave person . Of a rather dark , almost swarthy skin typical of some Norwegians , there were two dark red spots now in her cheeks as she sat low in her chair looking after her daughter . She wore a net about her head from which the hair in grey fringes projected at the back and sides . Hers had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to two solid anchors , the kitchen , symbolizing the physical needs of a growing family , and the Bible , that supplies the soul . Her voice was somewhat heavy and low pitched . How she ever got to be Gurlie 's mother always seemed a mystery . Between Gurlie and her mother there was absolutely nothing in common , aside from the fact that they were women . From the time Gurlie had first put the family misfortunes behind her and faced a job in the new world , her family was finished for her , as far as her own life was concerned . " This is a new world , " she would say . Or at least her every look bespoke it . " All right , I 'll work ! " and she had worked . " But I wo n't forget that you , all of you brought me to this . I 'll get out of it . See if IP213do n't . I will . But I do n't want you . You go ahead and see what you can do , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been that when the old man , herfather , had died and the mother was left practically penniless she had never lived with Gurlie , never lotlong . " Now they think that because I 'm going to he rich they can do that to me . Wait and see . " " We 're going to eat in the kitchen , " said Gurlie coming to the door of the front room . " I have n't time to set the table . Just a cup of tea . " " I 'm not hungry , " said her mother . " Do n't be silly . Come and eat , " said Gurlie . " You act like a child . " " And what a child you are , " said the old lady . " I 'm ashamed of you , to speak to your mother that way . " " Suit yourself , " said Gurlie . Neither one trusted or liked the other and did n't pretend differently , blaming her for all those misfortunesof which in each case she found the other to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family , the one to feel most the disappointments and bad luck which had driven them from home to this country . Whereas she , in the old lady 's eyes , was a visible reminder , product of an evil age and bound to come to a bad end . " You will see , " she always said and sometimes with a cold glee in her tones . " God will punish you too for your sins . " In spite of it Gurlie had used the proper tactics and it was n't long before Grandma , remembering the magic word tea ! got up with some difficulty and shuffled toward the kitchen . The baby was banging the table with a spoon which Gurlie promptly removed , from behind , so that the baby did n't know where it went and looked at her own hand in astonishment to see if it were not still there . The two ladies did n't speak though Gurlie with undisguised disgust watched her mother pour her tea into the saucer , raise the latter gracefully on the tips of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without spilling a drop . Lottie wanted to do the same with her milk but was stopped just in time . The baby seemed to know that there was lightning in the air and became very excited , wiggling and jiggling in her high chair in grand fettle . " How did it come out this morning ? " said Mrs. Torlund at last in her rather hoarse voice . She had n't quite swallowed her tea and began to cough violently before Gurlie could answer . The battle was on again as of old . Anyone could have seen it who had remained with them ten minutes , anyone but Joe . Or maybe he saw more than he acknowledged , the familiar struggle between the generations . He , the only man in the situation , was the immediate object , that is to say they both played up to Joe  --  waiting for a chance to put the other in a bad light in his eyes . It was an obvious maneuvering for power , no difference that they were mother and daughter , they were women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been a stickler for form  --  which explained , of course , Gurlie 's slapdash methods , as the rebellion they represented , her mother 's orthodoxy having failed to keep the family secure and together , Gurlie looked with indifference on the details of housekeeping . The old lady understood perfectly and resented her daugh/ter 's every gesture , the more so in that she recognized therein her own failings . And having a language between them which Joe did not grasp only intensified the heat of their addresses , though the Norwegian became natural enough to the children as time went on . Joe made fun of them all , ridiculing their " ogs " and their " ugs , " when he felt in the mood for it , with his usual half feigned heavy banter . Anyhow Gurlie and her mother fought from the first day the old lady arrived at the house , bitterly , continuously  --  though both of them , waiting for a strategic moment  --  had kept it all strictly out of Joe 's ears . The old lady wanted to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife he had  --  and Gurlie in like manner wanted to convince him that her mother could not possibly stay with them that winter . " Why do n't you smile ? " said Gurlie to her mother . " You go around with a face on you to make everybodyunhappy . What have we done to you ? What 's the matter ? " " What 's the matter ? Huh ! yes , " said the old mother . " You ask that . As if you thought I did n't know . There 's no welcome for me in this house . " " Well , I do n't want to talk about it now , " said Gurlie . " Come , " she said to the children . " I want you to go in and take a nap . Go on , " she said to Lottie and lifted the baby from her chair . She did it abruptly , scraping the child 's shins against the back edge of the tray . " Just like you , " said her mother . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of scraping the poor child 's shins off . "   " What shall I do then ? Let her learn to hold up her feet . " Flossie was crying again . " Shut up ! " to the child . " Lift up the tray before you take the child out . " While Gurlie was out of the room with the two children , the old lady cleared the table , got out the dishpan and pouring hot water into it began washing the children 's glasses . Gurlie came back and told her she did n't want her to do it . " I 'll do it , " she said . " Am I to do nothing in this house then ? " said the old lady . " You ca n't see , " said Gurlie . " You never get anythingclean . " That was a little too much . " So that 's what it 's come to , " said the old lady . " I 'm going back to Brooklyn . " " Do n't act like a child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe for this a little more gradually . " All right , if you want to wash the dishes , wash them . " " No , " said the old lady . " Wash them yourself . I 'm not staying in this house another night . I 'm going . " " Mother ! Mother ! " called the children . " Keep quiet , " yelled Gurlie back at them . " You 're a fine mother for two such children , " said the old lady . And then Flossie began to cry . Gurlie threw the soap holder into the pan , rinsed her hands , wiped them and left the room . Her mother took the soap out of the hot water , placed it on the drain board and followed her daughter . She was mad and bitterly determined . " It is because I am old and you are afraid I am going to be a burden to you in your life that you want to get rid of me , " said the old woman to her daughter . P217Gurlie had gone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old lady held back for a momentuntil Gurlie returned from the bedroom and closed the door . " Very well , I am going , " said the old lady . " But before I go I am going to tell you something about yourself that you have to know . I am your mother and no one else will tell you . So I will tell you . " " Leave me alone , Mother , " said Gurlie . " Ca n't you hear the children crying ? Do n't talk so loud . You ca n't hear yourself . " " They are crying for your sins , that 's what they 're crying for . Yes , I can hear myself . And you are going to hear me too . " Gurlie also was mad . " Nobody wants you , " she said to her mother . " I am not the only one . You will never thank anybody for anything . You think only of yourself . You are like all old people . " " Shame on you ! Shame ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk that way to your mother . You are the selfish one . You . Not me . You have always been selfish . Everybodywas sorry for you . We had nothing at the end so they gave you everything . But you never said thanks for anything . You took , took , took . As if it was yours . But it was not yours . They gave it to you out of the kindness of their hearts because you were the youngest , you were the baby . But they should have given you nothing , because that was what you deserved . " " You blame me , " said Gurlie , " because I always held my head high . I have nothing to be ashamed of . " " No ? You are ashamed because I am poor and need to be helped . No , you have nothing to be ashamed of but your own mother , that is all . Money , that is what you want . Money , without love . Just to get and to get . P218And you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much good may they do you . Take them . I will not ask you for a farthing . Never . You could n't give me a dirty comb . " Flossie was crying again , inexplicably , harder and harder . " Listen to her , " said the old lady . " It is your own conscience that is crying in your child . I pity your children . I pity them . " Gurlie went in to Flossie . Lottie too did n't want to stay in the room . " Get up then , " said Gurlie to her abruptly , " and go into the kitchen . And stop it , " said she to Flossie . " Stop it , do you hear me ? " Flossie sobbed louder than ever , becoming hysterical . " What is the matter with you ? You never act like this . " " Once they start like that it 's hard to stop them , " said the old lady in a quieter voice behind her daughter . " She has n't cried like that , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sick ? Stop it . Stop it . " She shook her daughter . " And lie down . The very devil is in this house this afternoon . " She went out and closed the bedroom door but Flossie was shrieking louder than ever now , standing in her crib , holding on to the sides and giving her whole soul to it . " Poor child . Poor child , " said the old lady . " Let me take her . " " No , " said Gurlie . " Keep out of that room . She never cried like that till you came here . " " All right , " and the old lady started toward the back of the house . " Where are you going ? " " I 'm going to pack my valise . I 'm going to leave this house . I tell you I wo n't stay here . You are inhuman . You are a brute . I wish I had never borne you . " That stopped Gurlie for a moment . But she tossed her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @   She did n't want her mother to leave so abruptly , for many reasons . And yet The old lady was coming back into the room . " Idid n't finish what I wanted to tell you , " she said , " when the baby started to cry . I want to finish it because I shall never come to this house again . I want to warn you . Because I am sorry for your husband and your children . You are my daughter but I want to tell you that I have never , in all my life , had to do with such an inhuman wretch . " " Yes , " said Gurlie coldly . " It was I who ruined my own father , I suppose . He was a gentleman , a man of culture and refinement . " " Let your father be out of this , " said the old lady . She knew what Gurlie was driving at now . She was from the farmer branch of the family , unlike her husband . She had had little schooling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , you shall hear me , once and for all . " Gurlie 's lather had been unfortunate in business , the tall slender-handed , bookish type , fair and with far-away blue eyes , whose antecedents , as Gurlie was fond of declaring , stretched back without a break for over five hundred years to the same Baron Rosenkranz whom Shakespeare had spoken of in his Hamlet . " You speak to me of your father , you . What do you know of his troubles ? But you . All you want of a man or of anything is what you can get , get , get out of him . " Having inherited a prosperous tannery , old man Torlund had allowed everything to slip through the interstices of his literary taste and so had brought the family to ruin and America . " America ! " Gurlie would say , " upstarts , nouveauriches , descendants of the riff-raff from English debtorP220prisons , indentured servants and the good for nothing younger sons of the noble and the wealthy . Bastards ! " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gurlie would level most of her hatred , a descendant of mere farmers . And among Norwegians hatreds can be extremely deep-seated . The old lady might have been a Swede for all Gurlie thought of her . " If you say I ruined your father , it was not what you will do to your husband . He does n't know you . Not yet . But he will find out . You think only of one thing . I am in your way , I bring you nothing . Once there was honor in being old . No more . There is no place for an old woman in your household . Nowhere today . " So it gradually petered out . Flossie would sob and hush , sob and hush , until finally she too subsided . Joe came in after six . " The bastards have bought my presses away from me , " he said at once . " Hoe says they ca n't let me have them . I ordered them two months ago . " " What are you going to do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you sure ? " " I 'll get them . And I ca n't get ink . They 've intimidatedeverybody . They 're afraid to sell to me because if they do , they 'll lose the old company . Their orders will always be larger than mine . " " Is n't that sort of thing illegal ? " " No time to do anything about that . I ca n't wait . How 's supper ? " " I have a good supper for you . " " I 've got to go back downtown tonight . I have to meet some friends . " P221WHAT 'S THE MATTER withthe baby ? " said Joe after supper . " I never heard her cry like that . " " She 's been crying all afternoon , " said his wife . " What 've you done to her ? " " I do n't know , " said Gurlie glancing at him sharply . " I put her in our room tonight . Maybe it 's strange to her . " " Why did you do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . " " Why not ? " " She bothers my mother . " Joe looked but was silent . The baby behind the closed doors subsided for a moment and the family went on with the meal . Grandma hardly raised her head from the plate and as nobody seemed to have anything more to say , nobodysaid anything . They ate in silence . But the child in the closed room had not gone to sleep . Lottie following the usual routine was far away snug in her own little bed , but not the baby . She lay with wide open eyes staring into the dark  --  expectantly . She felt completely off her base , not knowing what was going to happen . Something was going to happen . Someone was coming to take her . She knew that . And she 'd be back , she knew that too  --  maybe . They were here now waiting for her  --  but she did n't want to go . Not yet . P222She lay listening , a long time . Sometimes she heard talking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a bar of light from the street below that lay diagonally across the ceiling above her . Then she fell asleep and slept  --  a long , long time . It was late . Joe had gone out after supper and had not yet returned . Gurlie stretching herself in the big bed near the baby fell asleep too finally . Nothing of the day 's events at home had as yet come to Joe 's ears . The old lady had agreed to wait until Sunday when she would speak to her son Gunnar and ask him to take her away . She and her daughter were from now on through with each other . Definitely . A few nights more and that would be the end of it . A new world filled the entire room when the baby wakened . Stumbling upon memory , the short but intense memory of an infant , she lay there again with wide open eyes staring into a blankness peopled vividly by what she had seen that day  --  the storm of the dark , the stress and rocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere , jangled upon her ears all afternoon . Such a little-tin-cup what could it possibly mean to her ? Something as natural , as simple and overwhelmingas the dark itself had suddenly disrupted her life . By a slight movement of the air in the room , barely stirring the window shade , there appeared on the ceiling once more the strip of narrow , flickering light from some street lamp outside . Flossie watched it untilher eyes closed with the heaviness on them . Then she opened them again ! but they were open ! and there it was still , unmoving , where it had been before . She wanted to cry only it would n't come , the lightP223would n't let it . She had heard herself cry in the afternoon , she had felt it all over her driving her to greater and greater furies until she had sweat and fought to surround herself with its deafening protection  --  stopping occasionally now and then only to see what else might be going on . She had heard herself with astonishment and satisfaction . Out of desperationshe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels , yelling . Her mother had picked her up and she had stopped . She had been put down and she began again to yell . The light flickered , flickered , flickered on the ceilingabove her and she watched it intently . But she wanted to hear herself again  --  to know that she was there . It felt less lonely to yell  --  it was the night with its angry faces and loneliness that was terrifying , her own voice killed it but it came again when she stopped  --  so she took up courage and cried out aloud . She could have stopped if she wanted to , she knew that . But in the night when one is alone in a strange place distorted , familiar faces appear . Alone but for the light and her own voice , she cried out for relief . " What in heaven 's name are you yelling for now ? " said Gurlie leaning over the crib . " Go to sleep . Are you sick ? What is it ? " This startled the baby afresh , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her that way out of the dark so suddenly . Gurlie felt her bottom . It was dry . She felt her head . She felt her belly . " There 's nothing the matter with you . You 're a had girl . Go to sleep . " That 's just exactly what she wanted to do , go to sleep . Go to sleep . She must go to sleep . No .   She could see her mother go out of the room and close the door behind her , muttering . She could see her mother 's head and her back and her left hand on the doorknob . She saw the door closing and the arm get shorter and disappear . She did n't want her mother to leave her there alone . Then it was dark again . The light on the ceiling shone steadily . Then , while she was looking at it , the light went out quickly and completely . It was gone . She waited  --  she waited , then slowly the ceiling of the room began to disappear , going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was a pit ! Down , down  --  as far as she could see and there she stood teetering all alone at the top  --  down , down , down . As she began to fall , little Flossie cried out with all her might . She heard it and struggled out from her bed clothes and stood holding on the side of her crib . Then waited , alone in the dark . No reply . " Mammie ! Mammie ! " she cried . She was not used to crying this way so she stopped and looked around right and left but there was nobody near her , not even Lottie in the next crib . Just behind her were streaks and billows of uninterpretablemeaning to which she turned in terror . Was it a face with angry brows , that puffed and strained and bellowed ? It approached and hovered in the room , contorted into namelessness , and exploded before her . It wanted to smile , the baby could see that . But more powerful than itself , it took on a twisted shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now it will come again . She saw it . It was herP225grandmother , a big face that filled the whole room . Instead of getting larger as it approached , it grew smaller  --  until she reached for the familiar arms and hands to lift her . She pushed herself up on her toes to be taken and there was nothing there . Now the face reappeared in furious agitation and it was her mother 's face that came closer and closer and then , angry and distorted , burst suddenly and angrily over her . She reached in the dark , tried to take a step and fell face down upon the crib . Gurlie came into the room , took up the child , placed her under the covers . " Now close your eyes and go to sleep , " she said . But she went out at once again and closed the door behind her . Flossie tried to lie quiet but after a while she opened her eyes and looked up again into the dark . She knew perfectly well what she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She struggled against the covers but they were tucked in tight . At this she caught her breath once or twice but remained silent . Finally the infant got control of herself and listened . " Mammie ! " she cried . " Mammie ! " Then she could hear voices in the other room . She waited for several long minutes . She called again and waited and still nothing happened . At this she began to yell , dully , methodically , withoutrest just to hear herself yell . Unending misery of an unalterable world . No beginning and no end . This is life and this is my reply to it . Sleep can bring no answer , sleep the interrupter that denies and defies the great law . I will not sleep . I refuse , I refuse , I refuse . Assure nee that this is not true . That this is not the end.  |p226Assure  me that the world will go on as it did before this dreadful fall . Something is lying on top of me . Something is carrying me away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that held me and did not drive me away , but I am falling . I am being driven away into a place I never saw . The darkness is falling and I am going up , rapidly , through it . She was sobbing and screaming now , harder than ever . In blank terror . Why does n't someone come to me ? She reached up as if expecting to be taken . The end is approached in darkness , obliterating all that has been heretofore . Blackness , the mother of sleep , the worst misfortune of all . " The little brat ! " said Gurlie to Joe when he came in later and heard her . She had been shrieking and screaming all evening . " I told you it was her teeth . " " Nothing of the sort . No . I refuse to let you go in to her . It 's all she wants . She 's going to do what I say or cry until morning . I will not give in . " " And you want me to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minute we light the light . " " Got any beer on the ice ? " " Yes . " " Let 's go in the kitchen . She 'll quiet down . Where 's your mother ? " " She 's asleep , " said Gurlie . " She says she 's leavingus on Sunday . " It was a relief to get that off her chestbefore the old lady herself could say anything . " What 's happened ? " " We ca n't live in the same house . It 's no use . I 'm going to get a good maid this time . I 'll get some good-P227looking green girl and train her . We 'll have to have someone . I 'll make a good maid of her . " " Listen to that child yell , " said Joe . " She must be sick . What frightened her today ? " " Nothing that I know , " said Gurlie . " You ca n't tell me that , " said her husband . " She would n't be like that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was downtown . She was crying when I came in . " " Did your mother say anything ? " " No . Just that she had been bad . " " Did she spank her or punish her ? " " Maybe . I ca n't think of everything . " " Did you ask her ? " " No . I ca n't talk to her any more . " " Listen to that , " said Joe . " Is n't that bad for her ? " " Let her yell . Of course , pick her up , spoil her . he 'll hate me  --  that 's probably what you want . " " Well , do n't start on me , " said Joe . " I have n't done anything . " The insane night prodding the infant with its numb hands , revealed her father 's voice to her but not her father . She had been at it for hours , anger , acceptance and loneliness . So that when Joe and Gurliefinally went in to her she did n't quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror . Slit did n't know them . Joe went to pick her up but she squirmed almost out of his arms . " Give her to me , " said Gurlie . But c baby pushed her away , shaking and twisting her cad . " I think she 's gone crazy , " said Joe beginning to be frightened . " Shall I get a doctor ? "   " I think she 's got a fit , " said his wife . " Put some water in the tub  --  " Night chortled in the corners of the room , " You did it . You did it . You 'll never be able to undo this , never , never , never , never . " " Quick , " said Gurlie . " Do what I tell you . " " No , do n't be a fool , " said Joe . " She has n't got a fit . She 's only frightened . She 'll catch a cold . " " Here , " he said . " Stop it . Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby to the light . " I 'm going to take her out into the kitchen where we can quiet her . Wash her face with cold water . " The infant , unexpectedly , dropped her head forward as Joe held her and was really asleep at last . But when he had taken her back to the room and put her into the bed again , she awoke as suddenly with wide , unseeing eyes and began screaming once more . " God , as if we did n't have enough , " said Joe . " Now this . I think it 's the vaccination . She 's out of her mind . Give her an enema , it must be her stomach . " " No , " said the night . " What ? " said Joe . " I did n't say anything , " said Gurlie . " I think we 're going crazy ourselves . It 's been too much . I wish you would get your business settled so this family can be normal again . " " I wish I 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll tear it up tomorrow and tell them all to go to hell . I 'll move out to Cincinnati or St. Louis or anywhere away from New York . What did you give her to eat for supper ? " " What do you think I gave her ? Caviar ? " " No , I thought you gave her pork tenderloin andP229horse radish and sauerkraut . What did your mother give her for lunch ? " The baby was quieting , quieting , quieting as they talked . Sobbing less and less  --  starting all over with a sudden jerk , opening her eyes a slit  --  as if it were there again , the terror , the loneliness and the endlessnessof suffering . Then , right there under their eyes as they watched her , she was asleep . " Thank the Lord for that , " said Gurlie . " That was terrible . I ca n't understand what did it . " " You must have frightened her , " said Joe . " She 'd better get over it then . Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anything new to tell me today ? " " No , " said Joe looking at his watch . " Two A.M. Nothing except that everything is settled . I 'll get the presses on the floor tomorrow ready to set up . I 've got a night watchman there tonight . " " What for ? " " Well , nothing is insured yet , " said Joe , " for one tiling . But everything else is settled or nearly so and the whole lithographic department is coming over to me as soon as I want them . Come on let 's go to bed . I 've got a big day tomorrow . " " Do n't you want your leer ? " " No . I suppose we 've got to go in there , " he added . The night stood outside the window this time and did n't come in  --  but smiled . " See you later . But do n't forget me . She wo n't , " he said pointing to the ' baby . " You 'll see . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be night a little written upon her brain . ' I u some extent , my fine lady and gentleman , who think you know so much , to some extent she is mine .   See that you take good care of her henceforth , for me . " And the thing was gone . Joe dreamed that he had some sort of a frog-like beast in his hand , only it was n't a frog , it had a tail and he was holding its head under water , in a pail . " Do n't do that , " someone said , " that 's cruel . You 're drowning it . " " That 's what I 'm trying to do , " said Joe . He did n't know why , he did n't want to drown it but he had to . What else could he do with it ? It was n't good for anything . Then the thing , which had a big lizard 's mouth , pulled its head to one side out of the water and looked up at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly . " My God , " he heard Gurlie saying . She was leaningover the baby 's crib looking down at it , its smeared little face , its hair , the lace collar of its little nightdress  --  where it had relieved itself  --  lying there in puddles and chunks . " That explains it , " said Joe . " No , " said his wife . " She had nothing different to eat today than any other time . She just worked herselfup into it . It was the devil in her . The whole house has been upset today . " " I suppose a troll spit in the milk this morning , " said her husband . And he rolled over on his side and was soon snoring quietly . To which Gurlie added to herself , apropos of nothing , as she was getting back into bed , " I 'll be glad to get rid of her . She 's had her life , let me have mine . "   GETTING OFF the Brooklyn Derry one afternoon that same week Joe Stecher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slip as usual , throwing everyone a little off balancebut Joe was used to that . The boat-hand had leaped ashore , picked up the cable with the heavy hook at the end of it , slipped that into place at the boat 's prow and gone to the hand-winch , spinning the wheel so that the chock rang against the ratchet like hammers on an anvil until the rope pulled taut . 1 here they were . The boat-hand jumped from his position at the winch , grabbed a short rope-end and pulled the panel of planking into place bridging boat and dock to make a safe footway . A second man who had been %landing waiting on the boat in the center of the team way pushed up the iron extension gates , first on one side then the other with a dull clank , automaticallyfreeing them at the passenger exits beyond the stanchions where they were fastened . The people surged forward . As Joe was about to step on the plankway he felt himself suddenly thrust to one side by a burly man who forced his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the boat rail ended and there was a gap with open water below it between boat and dock  --  oily green water . Joe would have gone into this , strikinghis head more than likely on the way down , if  | someone had n't grabbed him by the sleeve and pulled him back , just in time . " The son of a bitch ! " said this unknown rescuer looking after the roughneck who had gone running on ahead . " He ought to get a good kick in the ass for a thing like that . " " Much obliged , " said Joe . " You 're welcome , " said the stranger . " Glad I saw you in time . " It had all happened so quickly that no one else noticed that anything had occurred . Joe felt irritated and uneasy . He hesitated a moment almost deciding to return to New York by the same boat . But it was mid-afternoon , now or never , he might as well continue . After getting a drink of ice-water in the ferry house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trolley for Long Island City . There were n't four other people in it . He studied them all . Harry Nesbit of Nesbit &; Hubsmith , Inks , Inc. was a little startled when he recognized the figure of Joe Stecher , familiar enough to him , coming across the street before the sprawling , one story plant of the ink company where it lay backed up on a siding of the Long Island R.R. Mr. Nesbit was sitting at his desk thinking of the coming winter when he first noticed Stecher and quickly adjusted himself to the new situation . " Damn it , that 's Joe Stecher ! " he said to his secretary . " Let him in when he comes to the door and make yourself scarce  --  for about a half hour , then come back again . See ? Get along . He 's coming in now . " Yes sir . " Mr. Nesbit grew busy comparing two sets of figuresP233lying before him on the desk and pretended to be surprised when Joe was ushered into the room . " Well I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you , Stecher . Come in , " and he offered Joe his hand . " Take a chair . What can I do for you ? " Joe knew perfectly well that Nesbit knew what he was there for . " I have n't received that order I gave you last month . I need it right away , " said Joe . " What do you mean ? " said Nesbit incredulously . " Why I 'm sure we sent that out weeks ago . Did n't you get it ? Where was it to be shipped to ? " Joe did n't say anything but looked down at the floor , sick at heart . " Do you remember offhand what that order comprised , Stecher ? Let 's check it back . If anything has gone wrong . . . You know how such things will occur . " " Here are the items , " said Joe taking a folded paper from his inside coat pocket . Mr. Nesbit spread it on the desk . " Why I do n't remember this , unless I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are you sure you gave us this order ? " He pressed a button . His secretary appeared promptly . " Have Mr. Butler come here at once , " said Nesbit . " It seems to me I do remember this though , " said he going over the items again . " Oh Mr. Butler , here 's this order we got from Mr. Stecher several weeks ago , to be shipped to  --  What was that address , Stecher ? " " too Center St. was the address given but that was changed later . " " Oh , yes , " said Mr. Butler . " I remember that order . That was delivered day before yesterday to Wynnewood &; Grossman , we did n't know what to do with it . That was the regular money order shipment , was n't it ? They called up about it and I sent it right over by truck . " " I 'd like to duplicate that order today , " said Joe , " for shipment this afternoon . I 'll take care of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Thank you , Butler , " said Mr. Nesbit . " I 'll speak to you later . " The plant foreman left the room . " Listen , Stecher , I ca n't let you have that ink . " " Much obliged , " said Joe , " for your honesty . I thought you would n't lie to me . So you ca n't let me have it . " " No , Stecher , I ca n't . And I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry as I can be . I do n't know any other place , either , where you can get anything of that quality right off . Not in this town . You might find somebody has a stock they 'll let you draw on but . . . " " They 've boycotted me every place I can turn , " said Joe . " I 've got to have it too , quick . " " You 've got to have it this week , do n't you ? And this is Wednesday . You see Stecher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know all about it and I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry as hell . But what can I do ? I 've got to protect myself as well as you have to protect yourself . " " Not by doing a thing like that , " said Joe . " You 're wrong , Stecher , absolutely wrong . If I give you what you want it 's going to cost me  --  it 's hard to measure it in money . I just ca n't let you have it and I know this whole region is sewed up against you . How are you doing about the shop ? " " I 've got the shop , " said Joe . " And I 've got my presses set up in it . " Nesbit let out a gliding whistle to express his surprise and admiration . " Is that so ? " said he .   " All but the last one . " said Joe , " and that 'll be there tomorrow . " " Well , by God Stecher , congratulations ! I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held out his hand . Joe took it automatically . " How did you manageit ? I know , of course , what they did . Just the same as they did with me . They bought your presses right out from under your nose , did n't they ? I 'm surprised that Hoe let them do it . Do you know that . " " I did n't get them from Hoe , " Joe answered him . " Second hand ? " asked Nesbit . " No , I have new presses , the only other place I could get them . " " You mean Scott ? " " Yes , " said Joe . " That was a quick order . Cash ? " " Yes , " said Joe . Mr. Nesbit sat back in his chair and looked at Joe without an expression of any sort crossing his face . " Say , Stecher , where in God 's name do you get your money ? " " Money talks , " said Joe . " Do you think you 're going to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hardly believe it . Did you have any money of your own ? " " Will you let me have half my order ? " said Joe looking Nesbit in the eye . " Now listen , Stecher . I ca n't let you have any ink out of this plant . Not any . I 'm sorry . I feel like a skunk if you want to put it that way but I have n't got it in here . It 's on order , every last drop of the quality you want for the next six months to the MohawkPress . Now call me what you please . After all I 'm in business to sell ink , they 're my best customers and that 's all I can say about it . " " Very well , " said Joe getting up , " then I better not waste any more time here . " " Have you tried Boston ? Or Philadelphia ? " " Yes . All the big companies have been tied up against me . " " I suppose you 're right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his finger a moment . " I do n't know why you got into this , Stecher . I think you 're an awfully foolish man . One of the finest workers I 've ever encountered , honest , able , straightforward . You could have gone to the top , Stecher , right where you were if you 'd only been willing to listen to reason . I think you 're going to make a mess of this . I do . I really do . I do n't see how you can win . " " Do you want my business if I do ? " said Joe . " Well , you 've got nerve . I like that . " " I wish I knew of a shipment of ink coming in from Germany somewhere today , " said Joe . " Yes , I know , Stecher . You wish . So do I. That is n't going to get us anywhere . " He thought a mo ment . " You know , Stecher , " he began again , " when I come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same pickle you 're in today . " " Who was that ? The poor devil , " said Joe . " He wanted a special order and I could n't give i to him . He could n't seem to get it anywhere . Do yot know what he did ? " " Made it out of shoe-leather , " said Joe . " You know , maybe you said something there , ' commented Mr. Nesbit of Nesbit &; Hubsmith , Ink ; Inc. with a twinkle in his eye . " You know , Stechel the thing is you 've really got some qualities I admireP237I ca n't really help you much . I 'd like to , I really would , but if I were in your position do you know what I would do ? " " No , " said Joe . " What would you do ? " " I 'd do the same as this man I was telling you about did . I would n't wish for the impossible . And I would n't go to the big fellows either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to some little place nobody ever heard of . You know there are lots of small places if you can find them . Around the suburbs of New York . " " Too late for that I 'm afraid , " said Joe . " I 'll get it  --  somewhere . " " I hope so , Stecher . But if I were you I 'd go out around Jersey way . Out toward Paterson maybe . " " I 've already been there , " said Joe . " They do n't have what I need . " Joe stood up and took his hat . " Now listen to me , Stecher , " said Mr. Nesbit standingalso and putting his hand on Joe 's shoulder . " I like you . I do n't want you to think too ill of me for this . I ca n't help it . Do you understand that ? " " Yes , " said Joe . " There 's no hard feelings ? " " None in the world , " said Joe . " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faulheber &; Schwartz , make a note of the name . It 's a new firm beholden to nobody . I think they 've got what you want . " Joe looked at the man standing there smiling and looked and looked again at him somewhat at a loss to grasp the meaning of his words . " I think you can just make it if you hurry , " said Nesbit looking at his watch . At that moment the secretary came back to the office and sat at her desk .   " Well , Stecher , I 'm sorry I ca n't help you old man . The best of luck . And when you need anything later on , do n't forget us . We 're tied up now . Everything of the best . So long . " Joe suspected a trick but he could n't afford not to take a chance on it . Faulheber &; Schwartz , eh ? He had n't thought of them . A new firm of ink makers . Hardly known . Well , a desperate man takes desperate chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails I 'll take the night train to . . . Chicago , if I have to . He got his inks from Faulheber Sc Schwartz . " I want them to go in tonight , " he said . " I want them on the truck now , while I 'm here . " " How are you going to pay for them , Mr. Stecher ? " said young Faulheber . " I 'll give you a check on the Chase National Bank . " " Too late to have it certified today , sir . Sorry . Ca n't do it . Wo n't tomorrow do as well ? " " Not in this case . I want them now , today . " " What you 've got listed here , Mr. Stecher , comes to about four hundred and twenty dollars . I 'll ship it to you tomorrow , C.O.D . but I ca n't let it go off tonight unless I have the cash . And you 'll have to get your own truck to handle it . " Joe looked at the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you know Mr. Nesbit of Nesbit &; Hubsmith ? " asked he . " I should say I do . Everybody in the ink business knows him . " " Get him on the phone , " said Joe . " I 'll pay the charges . " " Mr. Faulheber wants a reference for me before he 'll take my check . Will you speak to him ? Here you P239are Mr. Faulheber . " Joe had n't waited for a reply from the other end . " All right , " said young Faulheber after a moment . " If you say so it 's all right with me Mr. Nesbit . Thank you very much . Yes , I appreciate it . " He hung up . " He seems to think a lot of you , " said the young ink maker turning to Joe . " You can take your order away with you tonight if you want to . I 'll get a truck . Where is it going ? " " I 'll fix that up with the trucking company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tired but exultant , did Joe finish his affairs that night ! It was after one in the morning when he finally arrived before the apartment . There was a light in the window by which he suspected how anxiously Gurlie had been waiting up for him . " Are you all right ? " she asked as he came in at the door . " Sure , " he said . " Never felt better in my life . " " Well , " she said sitting down , " that 's a relief ! Do n't you ever do that again . I had n't the least idea what had happened to you or where you were . You did n't tell me you were going anywhere . I kept supper on the table . I did n't know what to do . " " I had to do it , " said Joe . " I got my ink at last . " " Well , I 'm glad of that but you had me sick . I thought they had killed you at least and thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said her husband , " but they did n't succeed . " " What do you mean ? " " Nothing . I had to go out to Jersey . Now I 've gotP240my shop , my presses and the ink finally . If the place does n't burn down before morning I 'll start hiring tomorrow . " " You sure ? " said Gurlie . " They wo n't condemn the shop this time ? " " I had the bank take it out for me . Let ' em stop that if they can ! I got ' em at last ! The only thing that really frightened me was the presses . " " You frightened ? I do n't believe it . " " I was scared stiff . " " Why were you scared ? " " Even Scott does n't carry an order of presses like that on the floor every day . If they had n't had ' em I was licked . Why my order was in with Hoe for those presses two months ago . And there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock . That was the toughest spot of all . " " Have you had your supper ? " " Yes , I ate at a restaurant . " " But what happened ? " " I got the ink from a small firm I heard about out in Jersey . So I had them load it on a truck and took it in this evening . I got a nightwatchman guarding the place . I think we 're all set now to go to work . I 'm going to start hiring tomorrow morning . " " Are you going to get the help you want ? " " I think so . " He sat down and let his wrists hang loose , stretching his feet out before him . " There was a young girl here tonight to see you . She waited and waited . I did n't know what to tell her . " " What was her name ? " " Edith Griggs or Gregg , I think . Beautiful yellow hair . She said she used to work for you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " She wants to work for you again , I suppose . " " What did she come here for ? " " She did n't tell me . But I found out a lot of things I 've always wanted to know about the people you had in the old place . We talked for two hours . I gave her a cup of tea . She said she was English . " " All right , " said Joe . " It 's pretty late , I think we 'd better turn in . " " Say what kind of a place did you use to keep down there anyway ? I think all the girls are in love with you . " " Do n't be foolish , " said Joe . " What do you do to them ? She said one of the girls , Mabel something or other , I forget the name , cried and cried , all the morning , when she heard that ou were n't coming back . You certainly must have been good to them . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , " said Joe . " So you remember her . " " I helped her out once with a little advice when she was in trouble . " " Oh well , " said Gurlie yawning , " anyhow you 're fe . Do n't you ever do such a thing to me again . " " What did Miss Gregg say ? " " She 's coming back tomorrow night . " " That 's funny , " said Joe , " I wonder what she wants . " " You 'll know soon enough . Very pretty . A beautiulyoung girl . I can see you like them blond . " " She 's not a young girl , " said Joe . " She 's a woman . Why do you speak that way ? If she comes here it 's for ' nine serious purpose . " Gurlie laughed . " Agh , you 're just a baby , " she said . " ( : o along with you to bed . You do n't know any-thing . "   The next evening after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , there was Edith Gregg . She beamed when she saw Joe but remained standing , obviously embarrassed , when Gurlie offered her a chair . " It 's been a long time since I 've seen you , Mr. Stecher , " said she . " Sit down , " said Joe . " How are you ? " " I 'm fine , sir . And you ? " " I 'm all right . Please sit down . How is everyone at the old shop ? " The young woman sat down at Gurlie 's right , facing Joe . " Pretty well , I guess , " she said . " Many have left of recent weeks , you know that . " " Yes , " said Joe , " I suppose you 're closing out the Money Order Department . " She laughed a little self-consciously , looking at him . " You still in charge of the girls there ? " asked he . " Yes , sir , " said Miss Gregg . " She told me all about that last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize they gave such young girls such important positions nowadays . " " She 's the best forewoman I 've ever had to work for me , " said Joe . " Thank you , sir . " There was a pause . " And pretty too , " said Gurlie . " You two go ahead and talk . " She got up and walked out of the room for a moment but came back at once and sat down again . " I suppose you 're wondering why I came here , " said Miss Gregg to Joe , unable to hold back any longer , just as Gurlie was returning . " Well , I presume ... " " You want to work for him in his new shop , " said Gurlie . " Of course you do , do n't be so backward . Ask him . He 'll take you . "   " Please , " said Joe to his wife . " Let Miss Gregg tell me what she wants . Is there something you 'd rather say to me in private , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , no , no ! " said the young woman hurriedly , looking at Gurlie . " I do n't care , " said Gurlie . " I 'll go to the kitchen . You can have him all alone if you want to . " Miss Gregg blushed crimson . " No , please do n't do that . I 'm just a little embarrassed . " Then turning to Joe . " I do n't know how to tell you , sir , " she said . " It seems so silly . Well , I 'll tell you . " She seemed to make up her mind . " Oh it 's so petty . I really feel ashamed to come here at all . " Gurlie got up and went to stand by the window again . " You see , sir , " began Miss Gregg , " you know I want to come with you and work in the new shop . You know that . " " That 's fine , " said Joe , " glad to have you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell you just the way it happened . You remember Mrs. Hatch . She had charge of the binding machine . Well , after you left .. . You 'll pardon me but I 'll always remember that day , that Saturday noon . " Gurlie at the window turned half around to listen . " I do n't know what made me look up . You were just at the door , you had a derby on I remember . You had opened the door then stopped , with the knob in your hand , and turned around and looked at us . I just caught that look . Then you were gone . " " Yes , " said Joe . " I remember . " " I do n't know what it was , " continued Miss Gregg , " hut I knew at once that something had happened . On Monday when you did n't appear we asked Miss Kraus why you were late . She always knew . Because you were never late . And she said , He 's not coming back ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried and cried , all morning in fact . " Gurlie , at the window , laughed . " So that 's what you do to your girls ! " said she . " We could n't understand why you had n't said goodbye to us . Then of course , later , we heard what had happened . But at first we were puzzled . " " What is it you want ? " asked Joe in a cold voice . " You were telling me about Mrs. Hatch . " " I hope you 'll pardon me , sir . I did n't mean to talk so much . All I want to say is that after you left , Mrs. Hatch was a little difficult sometimes . She was a good deal older than the rest of us , you know . Well , one day Mr. Burbank came up to me from the main office with a complaint that some specials they were waiting for had n't come through . He told me they were being held up in my department and he wanted me to get them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it until I discovered that Mrs. Hatch was holding them and that they had n't been bound up yet . So I told him where to look for them . But he would n't have it that way . He told me that I was in charge and that I had to tell her . Well , I did n't like that , I knew her too well . " Gurlie came and sat down in the chair again to listen . " The specials were at the bottom of the pile , " said Miss Gregg , " so I told her just as nicely as I know how that she would have to get them out because they were wanted downstairs . " " ' I ' 11 do them when I come to them , ' she told me . " " Oh no , ' I said speaking very politely , You 'll haveP245to put everything else aside and do them at once . They must be finished today . ' She got as white as a sheet . ' I refuse to take any orders from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry , ' I said , ' but you 'll have to do as I say because I 'm in charge here . ' " " With that she got to her feet and told me , ' I 'm going to report this to the office , ' and out she walked . In a few minutes she came back , even whiter than before and took her hat and coat and went out the door . We have n't seen her since . That was the end of it . " " I see , " said Joe . " We knew , of course , " went on Miss Gregg , " that it did n't make any difference to her because she was going to take a three weeks ' vacation and then go into your office . But it was very unpleasant . " " I think she was pretty fresh , " said Gurlie . " I supposesomeone else finished the work . " " Yes , " said Miss Gregg , " but you see , Mr. Stecher , I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shop . We all know that . And I 'd like to go too , only I do n't want to have that woman boss me . I do n't want to have anything to do with her . " " At last it comes out ! " said Joe smiling . " Well , Edith , you do n't need to worry about that . " " When you say it I believe it , " said Miss Gregg . " Do you still want to come with me if I promise you you wo n't have any more trouble with Mrs.I latch ? " " Oh very much , sir ! " She said it with feeling . " Look at that ! " said Gurlie . " So that 's the way a business is run ? " Poor Edith blushed crimson again . " You do n't need to call him ' Sir ! ' all the time that way , " said Gurlie . " He 'll begin to think he 's a little tin god . Maybe I should begin to say Sir ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Gurlie getting up and cuffing her husband across the top of the head . Joe kept his composure with difficulty . " Would you like something to drink , Miss . . . what is it , Griggs ? A glass of beer ? " " Edith ' if you do n't mind , " said the young woman . " No thanks , I do n't care for beer . " " Humph ! " said Gurlie . " Look at that . I 'm sorry I have n't any cake . " " Thank you just the same , " said Miss Gregg . " Shall I come to your shop on Monday ? " she asked Joe . " No , " said Joe . " Do what I have asked the others to do . If you want to work for me make a request in writing . Write me a letter applying for the job . I 'll give you the address . " " Smarty ! " said his wife . " Just write a few words saying that you have heard that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for me . I 'll let you know . " " I 'm very grateful to you , sir . You 've always been so kind to us all , I 'm sure we all appreciate it . I wish you every success , as if you need it from me . " " It never does any harm , " said Gurlie , " I believe in such things . " Miss Gregg got up to leave , " Shall I see you on your way home ? " said Joe . " Oh no , no ! Please . That 's not necessary . Goodbye Mrs. Stecher . I 'm sure you must be proud of your husband . It 's really an experience to work for him . He 's so painstaking and thoughtful . I 'm sure he 'll be successful . "   " Well , " said Gurlie after she had gone . " So that 's what you do to the women you employ ? You might think you had come directly down from Heaven into their laps by special dispensation . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Joe . " I want a glass of beer . " But Gurlie did n't stop riding him , " Yes sir , " she id , " Anything else , sir ? You might think you were n English lord . " " And you an English lady , I suppose , " said Joe . " What did you say ? " came back his wife . " I did n't say anything . " " Yes , you did . You 've got gross-wahn in the head from hearing all this praise and humbleness heaped you . But you wo n't get that from me , no sir . You t your own beer . " " Why do n't you at least sit still when somebody is telling us something , " said he . " Instead of jumping p and fiddling with your chair , coughing and going the window every minute . How can anyone feel at home in your house when you act that way ? Learn to ten . " Do you ? I know you too well . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "   " OSWALD ! WHAT IN ' HIworld are you doing ? " said Gurlie sitting with he elbows on the edge of the bare table watching him Elsa the new maid was standing in the doorway t the back hall . " Tell her to come in , " said Oswald to his sister-in law . And so , at last , Joe Stecher was successful and h had his shop set up on time and working in go order , promptly by December first as required in tit contract . He got even a better floor than the first h had leased , more conveniently located , better lighted he got his presses from Scott instead of from Hoe ; got the right ink , just what he wanted , and he a ready bad the paper from his good friend Lemo The workers from the old shop came over to him they had agreed to do and there he was , just as Gurlie had always known it would be , finally settled in bu ness for himself and likely to be successful with h knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eve . Oswa had come from Chicago for a visit , having been to nothing by his brother of what had been going and the children were in the seventh heaven , asle now . Elsa , the little Finnish maid , had turned out be an angel . Oswald was entranced by her blo prettiness . He sat in the dining room working , Chri mas only a few days off .   " She 's nice . Tell her to bring me a bottle of beer , and to open it , and pour it out for me into a glass . I 'll drink it myself . " " What are you doing ? " " Shh ! " he said . " This is a mystery ! Not so loud . You shall see ! " and he began to sing softly in his true , heavy voice : " ( There 'll be a hot time in the old town tonight . " What ? " said Gurlie . " What is that ? A hot time ? " " Bier her ! bier her ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Now you behave , " said his sister-in-law . " That 's one thing I do n't allow in this house . You behave yourself or get out . " " You should see yourself in the glass when you say things like that , " said Oswald laughing . " You look like Brunnhilde in Die Walkiire ready to tear Wotan hum his throne . " " What are you planning to do there ? " said Gurlie . " Wait and see , Snubnose , " he said . " Oswald , you 're impossible ! " " Sure I 'm impossible . How do you suppose I got this far , by being possible ? Come on Angel Face , give mr that beer . " Elsa looked at her mistress doubtfully . " All right , " said Gurlie , " give it to him . " " Now sit down here , " said Oswald to them both . It was no use , Gurlie sat at one side of him and Elsa at the other . He had a big package on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! A pot of library paste , two or three bottles of gilt and silver and gold paper in long rolls andsquares . " Spread out some newspaper . Come on , come on ,   come on Mach ' Schnell ! Get me two or three pairs of scissors , shears would be better , big ones , a couple of saucers , some old teacups  --  without any handles  --  and cracked ! Roll up your sleeves , "  --  he was sitting in his vest with his sleeves up to the elbow . What forearms ! " What are in those other packages ? " questioned Gurlie . " Ah , must n't ask too many questions . That 's for later . " Joe was in the front room reading his paper , trying to pay no attention to them . Whenever Oswald came , the spirit of Christmas came with him and Joe stepped aside for it . " Now get to work , " he said to his ladies , " and watch me . " As Gurlie and Elsa watched , he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were upon him , cut and folded and twisted and turned  --  " What are you trying to do ? "  --  until finally there emerged a gold six-pointe star . But not that alone for on its face were four little cones of gold , astonishingly perfect and pointed . " Now I 'll show you . " And he showed them each step , carefully , and made them imitate him . " We want at least two dozen of these , " he said . They could n't do it . So he set them to cutting the paper , both gold and silver , in strips , while he alone made stars . They chatteredand worked . The table and the floor were soon littered with tinsel . " Why do you live out there in Chicago ? " aske Gurlie . " Why do n't you come to live in New York ? " " I hate this damned city , " said her brother-in-law . " Chicago is n't so bad , yet . When it gets worse , I 'll disappear . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the herd . I hear it 's pretty good out there for a man now . " " Why do n't you get some nice girl for yourself and settle down ? " laughed Gurlie derisively . " Because you do n't have to settle down to get some nice little girl , " said Oswald . " What good is just one . I want a dozen . " " You 're never serious , are you ? " " Always serious . That 's the funny part about it . Do n't you think that 's funny that I 'm always serious ? ' Good for nothing , ' that 's what my wealthy brother Joseph calls me . Scatter brains . Unreliable . No womanwould marry a good for nothing like you . ' " " What do you do with your money ? " asked Gurlie . " What money ? I have n't got any money . " " Your salary , what you get every week . You must get paid well . " " I do . I 'm a good meat packer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful business . To pack meat . How can you stand it ? " " The slaughter house ? Why not ? It 's good meat . The best people buy it and eat it . All I do is pack it . What 's the matter with that ? Maybe some day though I 'll go to Argentina where it grows and that will be different . What 's the matter with good meat ? " " How much do you earn a week ? " " Come on out with me some night and I 'll show ou , " said her brother-in-law . " We 'll have a good ime . Listen , we wo n't tell Joe . Come on . I 'll show on  --  I got a pocket full of money . " " Do n't be a fool , " said Gurlie , " how much do you earn ? " " I bet I earn , " he said pretending to think , " more than I could eat off two or three sides of beef a month .   Look ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . Look , you can hold it in both hands what I earn in a month . Do you believe it , Elsa ? I could hold it in both hands . Like that ! " " Ow ! " cried the little maid as he grasped her in his big paws and held her paralysed for a moment before letting her go . " Look , " he said , " I could take a bull in one hand and peel off his hide with the other . Like that . Huh ? " " You ought to be ashamed of yourself , " said his sister-in-law . " Because you 're so strong you think you can do anything you want with a woman . " " And do , every time I want to spend the money on them , " said Oswald . " Is that what you do with what you earn ? " " You mean aside from Christmas ornaments ? I spend it , " said Oswald . " I throw it away . But first I save it and buy gold paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigars for my rich brother and something for Elsa here and a case of beer . " " You 're a fool . " " Sure I 'm a fool . " " If you had been sensible , " said Gurlie , " you could have married Martha . She was crazy about you . But what woman could trust a man like that ? " " That 's right , " said Oswald . " Where is there a woman could trust a man like that ? The answer is , everywhere ! " " Everywhere ? You mean nowhere . " " I mean everywhere . Anywhere . In the air . Over there . Take a chair . I never have any trouble finding swell girls . But I 'm too big . Nobody wants me . I do n't want to live in a house . What could I do with one house ? " P253Elsa 's eyes were opening wider and wider . She looked at Oswald as if she thought he was truly crazy  --  not understanding him  --  completely confused . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Sure . I work till I have some money . Then I spend it . Then I kill some more cows and cut them up into pieces , and some pigs and some sheep and pack ' em up carefully so they wo n't spoil . " " Oh , " said Gurlie , " you 're a bigger fool even than I thought you were and I 'm tired of this . Make your own silly ornaments . I ca n't get anything out of you . Go on Elsa . Go to bed . This man is crazy . " " Yes ma'am , " said the little maid and went demurelyaway . " Sleep well , " said Oswald to her . " And happy dreams ! " he laughed loudly . " And happy maidenlydreams , " he said and laughed again . " Shame on you , " said his sister-in-law to him after Elsa had gone . " For what ? " said Oswald looking at her with amusementon his face . " I could slap you , " said Gurlie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I will ! " said Gurlie and she swung her hand with full force at the side of his face , but still smiling he caught it , wheeled her off her feet , down onto his lap and kissed her  --  to her amazement under her ear behind her neck . Then he pushed her up on her feet again where she coked at him speechless rubbing her wrist . " Good old Joe ! " said Oswald . " What I would n't do if I had her . Get out of here now and leave me alone . I got work to do . " " You brute , " said Gurlie . " You hurt me . Joe , come ere . "   " What is it ? " said her husband from the odic ' room . " What do you think of this brother of yours ? " she said . " Not much , " said Joe . " Joe , " called out Oswald , " come in have a glass of beer . It 'll do you good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oswald . " All right , " said Gurlie and she went out for some beer still rubbing her wrist as Joe came into the diningroom . " Well , " said he , " you 're really working , are n't you ? What 's all this ? Very good . Very good . I 'm glad you 're good for something . " " Look , Gurlie , " said Oswald when she returned , " my successful brother is going to lecture me . " " I 'm long past that , " said Joe . " Whew ! " said Oswald , " I got a lot of work to do in the next five days . " " You 've got work to do ! " laughed Joe . " Well , who 's going to do it , if I do n't ? " asked the brother . " Do n't the children have to have a good Christmas ? Who 's going to do it if I do n't . " And he really worked . They would n't see him much mornings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing he was adamant about . " No . No thanks . I got places I can stay . " But he 'd come promptly around the middle of the afternoon and the children would be waiting for him . " What do you have her walking around in that awkward chair for ? " said he loosening the buckle and swinging the delighted Flossie high in the air into his arms . " She can walk . She could walk last year . Uppy , uppy , uppy ! And she can talk too , I 'll bet . " " It 's because she does n't want to walk , " said Gurlie .   " She would rather crawl . And she holds her left leg under her . You ought to see her go ! But she 'll grow up with one leg shorter than the other if we do n't keep her off the floor . " " Let me see , " said Oswald and he put her down on the table and measured her legs . " Nonsense . Maybe you 're right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bird , walk like a bear . You sit here now . " " Sit here now , " repeated the baby . Now came the real business of the day . " You 're not going to let those children ... " " Sure . Why not ? We need all the help we can get . ig doings . Christmas ! " he whispered to Lottie . " Atee . Chains of gold . Stars . Gold and silver stars . Snow on the branches ! Cornucopia ! You do n't know what a cornucopia is , do you ? A horn of plenty . Full ofcandy . And candles , like the stars ! That 's what we 're ing to have . But you got to work . You got to work ard ! " So he set the children to work . Elsa would  --  me in and shake her head and smile . He made such marvelous time of it , day after day . He got a cup , an old cup , and filled it with gold int . Then he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Oswald , you ca n't do that , " said Gurlie . " Ca n't do what ? " said Oswald . " You sit there and atch me . I can do anything . I 'm the boss here , " he id . And he turned to the baby . He took a walnut tid he dropped it into the cup of gilt , then he fishedout . " No , we 've got to have something bigger , " he said , " she 'll spill this . " Finally he had a good solid t pan . Into it went the nuts . Flossie dropped them . It was n't deep enough to cover them but she would 11 them around with her hands until he 'd lean over and take them out for her with a spoon and put them on a piece of paper to dry . On his other side sat Lottie making gold chains . What a mess ! " You 're a big girl now , " he said . " You 've got to learn . Suppose I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chains in this family ? " Lottie was deeply impressed with oh so sad , so sad a face . Oswald shook his head . Meanwhile he told the children stories , Flossie dab. bling in the dish of gilt till her hands and her face and  --  everything about her was gilded , Lottie having to be rescued at every moment as she attempted , painfully , to paste the links of the steadily lengthening chain together , as it grew and grew and lay in a coil on the floor at their feet . " Look ! " said the baby pointing down at it . " Pretty pretty ! " Day after day , stars and chains and little baske and gilded nuts as he worked and talked to the children about Christmas , when Kris Kingle would corn with dolls and wagons and all sorts of dainties for little girls . " Kris Kringle ! Kris Kringle ! will come , will come ! " " But you must n't forget , " said he suddenly than ing his voice , " about the other fellow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad one . " " Wheel " said Flossie splashing into the gold pal with both hands . " Hey there ! " said Oswald . " Take it easy ! " And had finally to take that away from her , it got a litt too much even for him . " Yes , " he went on . " Bla Rupert ! that 's the boy I 'm after . And when I get hol of him , I 'm going to pull him apart . I 'm going t slaughter him in his tracks and no mistake about iP257Look ! " he said , and that 's the way he talked . " He 's a real bad one . He wants to spoil all the fun . After Kris Kringle goes , Black Rupert sneaks up the stairs . You can hear him if you listen tight . He comes in and when nobody is looking he grabs the children and out he goes ! Whoo ! like that . Out the door . " " What in the world is the matter with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling those children ? " ' Leave me alone , " said he . " Because I 'm strong . I can.at anybody ! " he shouted . " I can take care of my ' tile girls no matter what happens . You wait and see . ' II be there ! " And it went on , day by day , getting more and more tense , until the great evening was at hand . And now swald was ready . " Do you remember , " said he to Joe that night , how Father used to make us go to church ? " " Yes , " said Joe . " I remember . " " Did you ever tell Gurlie about it ? " And all the me Oswald was working at his great creation . " I do n't know . Maybe , " said Joe . " What do you ran ? " said Gurlie . " I do n't remember anything pecially . " " Well , you know our father was a Protestant and r mother was a Catholic , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " said Gurlie . " Yes , our father was a Protestant , " said Oswald to Gurlie , " partly French on his mother 's side , a Hugue . You remember , Joe ? But our father always finedthat we go to church with Mother . One at a e we had to go , Adolph , Oswald , Ida , Joe , Clara . e all had to go . It meant nothing to me but I retuberhow pretty it was . Eh Joe ? " " Yes , I remember . "   " I always liked to go . Flowers on the altars and candles everywhere , very fine . " " That 's right , " said Joe . " I liked it . " And all the while Oswald was working . " I do n't see how you do that , " said Gurlie watching him . This was the masterpiece . " Where in the worlds a man who has lived a life such as you have lived , " said Gurlie . " Where did you learn that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has nothing to do when he is n't doing something else . So I learned cut paper . " He worked with the most delicate ca and it was strange to see his apparently clumsy han handle the small bits of paper with such extreme del cacy . Even Joe was fascinated and everyone lean close wanting to assist . " Hold this , " he would say . " There . Exactly there . And he would carefully place a drop of glue on t paper and fix one of his little cut-outs to it . It was the famous story of Jesus born in the ma ger . He made everything of paper , the holy famil the wise men , the bull , the donkey and a few shee At the back was the scene which he conventionaliz himself with watercolors from Lottie 's set . It was the form of an alcove . And as he worked , for hours , they would go aw about their business and come back again , they 'd h him singing to himself Maria and Joseph in Bel lehem Stadt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sai " Go ahead ! I do n't know how you have the patien for it . A man like you . " The whole scene of the nati ity out of paper . He gradually cut it all out and stthem up , camels and all the animals in the mang " I do n't know how you do it , " said Gurlie again and again . " Why not ? " said her brother-in-law . He was as alert as the finest technician . " Joe has all the brains and took care of us all as long as we 'd let him . Adolph played the violin . Ida married a Jew . Clara had a goodgure . What was left for me ? I had to learn to cut out paper . " A soldier ! Such a big fellow ! So strong ! " He 's nothing but a big kid himself , " said Gurlie . " And there it is ! " he announced . " Finished ! " He sat back and they all gathered around to admire his work , Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come down for the party next day . Even Grandma . The Creche ! Oswald had built it on heavy cardboard base so that it could be lifted and  --  laced under the tree . " What do you think of that ? " i ' lien he placed it , arranged it with evergreen boughs bout it and stood up and sang . " Come on ! " he said . hey all sang . Maria and Joseph in Bethlehem Stadtc sang it all , from beginning to end , all alone . Nobody else knew the words but they hummed it along with him . " And there we are ! Now for the big night . " Joe s uncertain about him but had to acknowledge he ad his genius . " How he builds it up ! " said Olga . The children are wild . I do n't see how they can sleep with all the things he 's been telling them about Black u pert and the rest of it "  |p260Christmas  Eve ! Tomorrow open house ! It would be the old gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Stechers ' and perhaps a few others , But tonight , Christmas Eve , was for the family . Clara , Joe 's youngest sister , the actress , now appearing on Broadway in a minor role , could n't be there , h u tmight come later after the performance though it was doubtful . But Ida , who might have come with her husband , once she found Oswald was there , said thank you . The rest appeared , all of them . " Where is Ida ? " " Sure , " said Oswald , " where is she ? Ai n't I gon see my big rich sister ? " " That 's enough , Oswald , " said Gurlie . " No mo of that . " " Why , what 's the matter ? " asked Gunnar . Joe w chuckling to himself . " Look at my husband , " said Gurlie . " You ought be ashamed of yourself , " she said to him . " What a you laughing at ? " " What is it , Oswald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometime . " The children were put to bed extra early with promises by Oswald to Lottie that if Kris Kringle d make up his mind to reward a good little girl wi pretty things  --  he 'd wake her . With that she went willingly . Gurlie and her mother and Aunt Olga and Hilda with blue eyed Elsa to run about , had prepared t goose . Oswald was busy putting the finishing touch on the tree which he dragged in from the room the kitchen , locked until that time . " I do n't think we should wake the children , " saidP261the fat auntie . " What do they know ? Let them see it in the morning . That will be time enough . " " You must be getting old , Olga , " said Oswald . " Joe , " said his sister-in-law , " stop that man . He 's Crazy . He wants to have all this excitement he is planningand the children in the middle of it . Children are not to play with like a doll . Gurlie ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ? Let us sing Stille Nacht and enjoy Christmas Eve like it should be , with respect . " " Gurlie ! " said Oswald . " Joe ! What do you say ? " " Oh , go on ! " said his sister-in-law . " Do n't listen to her , " pointing to Olga . " She has been afraid all her life . " " Fine ! " So they all sat down to supper . " But where 's the Linking lutfisk ? " said Oswald . " It does n't stink , " said Hilda . They all laughed . But we have n't got any . " He wo n't let me have it in the house , " said Gurlie pointing at Joe . " He said he 'll leave the house first . " " Maybe you do n't know how to cook it , " said Oswald looking at her with big eyes . " I hate the stuff . " " I 'd like to see anybody who knows how to cook it tter than I do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians , " id Oswald . Gurlie Gurlie carved , not Joe . " What 's the matter with u , Joe ? " asked his brother . " That 's one thing I wo n't do , " said Joe . " Come on . " " No , he wo n't , " said Gurlie . " He just wo n't . " " I work all day , " said her husband , " I do n't carve . " " Suppose she says the same thing ? " said Oswald . lien what ? " 262 IN THE MONEY " Then we do n't eat , " said Joe . So Gurlie carved . And how ! Whoops ! Everything went flying . " Hey ! " said Oswald . " Do n't you know a goose has joints ? " " Where ? " said Gurlie . " What do I care ! You want the meat , do n't you ? Then hold your plate . " Everybody laughed and the men turned their collars up . It amused Joe no end . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother . Oswald was a little shocked . " Gurlie ! " he said . " Let me show you something . " " No , " she said , " you get out of here . We 've heard enough from you . " " But I can show you how to save yourself a lot o work . You 'll break your arm that way one of the days . " " Pass your plates , " said Gurlie . It was marvelous " Come on ! are n't you hungry ? We believe in plent in this house . " " But Gurlie ! " They ate and they drank till Joe getting up befor the rest went to the front windows . " It 's snowing , " h said offering cigars to the men . " Wonderful ! " said Hilda . " Beautiful snow . I mu go and see it . Look at it there in the light , silently and steadily falling . " But suddenly they heard an outcry . It was Oswa with the two sleepy children , one on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oswald , you should n't ! Oh Oswald ! " said the auntie . " You ought to be spanked . Poor Lottie an poor little Spider . Wrap them up . Oh , I think it ' awful . " The baby was rubbing her eyes and her nose , yawning . Funny ! they rub their noses when they 're reallyp263sleepy . Lottie was blinking and looking about her with a blank face , first at one then at the other . " The tree ! Come now ! " said Oswald , " sing ! " and he started to sing and carried the two children into the front room where the tree was banked with the boxes and  --  Oswald had put the children down and you could hear bells jingling in the next room where he had gone ! They were wide awake now , even little Flossie . " It 's a shame , " said the fat auntie . " It should n't be allowed . " Joe just sat and smiled . " I want Daddy , " said the baby so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Then Oswald appeared in the doorway between the dining room and the parlor . He addressed himself to Lottie while everyone grew silent at his seriousness . " Listen ! " said he . All listened . Not a sound . " Yes , " id he , " I hear him . Listen ! " Still nothing . " He 's ust outside ! Just behind the door ! " This was the great moment he had been preparing or for the last ten days . " Lottie , " he said , " stay where ou are . Do n't move till I tell you . " Joe knew what it ould be but not the others . " It 's Black Rupert ! " whispered Oswald . " I know his smell . Everybody be till . I 'll fix him , " and he took a heavy cane which he ad placed there for the occasion , in his hand . " You must n't do that , " said Olga . " You 'll frighten them . " " I 'll get him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ w children , whispering  --  although little Flossie only aced in silent wonder and amazement at this tensely led scene . " Nobody move ! " said Oswald and tipedto the door . Suddenly he threw it back and cried out in a terrible voice . " So there you are ! " and out he went , the stick in his hand and the door slammed be . hind him . " But there are people living in this house ! " said Olga . Up and down the stairs a wild battle arose , shouts and half curses and groans . The stick rattled and clattered on the woodwork . There were bangs against the door . " Let go ! Now I 've got you . Ho ! Ha ! Let go ! " It was unbelievable . " What will people in the house think of this . Joel this is disgraceful . " Then the noise mounted higher and in the midst of it the door to the hall slowl opened . " Lottie ! Lottie " called Oswald in a hoar choking voice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack of the door . Lottie went to him as if magically drawn . Nobody prevented her . " Lottie ! run to th kitchen . Get the little white handled knife . The on I told you . Quick ! I 've got him . Quick . Quick ! " Lottie was off like a flash . She fumbled in the draw of the kitchen table and rushed back , the knife in h hand . Oswald took it . A moment after there was heavy thud . Then silence . Nobody spoke . You cool hear people out in the hall . " What a nerve ! " said Hilda . " To do a thing like that in a crowded apartment . " " Huh ! " said Gurlie . " I should say so . " Then the door opened and in walked Oswal Disheveled and out of breath , wiping the knife on hi pants . " He 's dead ! Black Rupert is dead . Now we a safe . Now we can open the presents . I killed him an threw him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair . But he was up in a moment . " Come o come on everybody . Oh ! " and he sank into a char again with Lottie in his arms . " What a fight that was .   " Well , " said Olga going into the kitchen , " I never expected to see anything like that in New York . Oswald ! are you crazy for true ? " But Joe was laughing his head off in excitement and amusement at the rest . " Come on ! " he said , " let 's unpack the diamonds and the fur pieces . " The poor l i t t l e baby did n't know what to make of it all . " Such quantities ! " Heaps and heaps of presents . " Such extravagance ! " " For Flossie ! " said Oswald taking up an enormous long box and putting it on the floor in front of the baby . " But Oswald ! " " Let her do it . " He cut the ribbons and cords in a flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child loose at the paper wrappings . " Leave her alone . " Everybody watched . Gradually , with her uncle 's assistance , the little girl undid the papers which he lifted away from her as soon as she had loosened them and there , there ! suddenly appeared  --  a lovely sleeping la ( e , the long eyelashes lying lightly on the alabaster cheek , the coral lips closed in a perfect Cupid 's bow  --  blond curls about the brows  --  ! " It 's too much , Oswald ! " Flossie looked up and grinned , her eyes sparkling . " That 's all I was waiting for , " said the big man and with one movement he swept the gorgeous doll fromits remaining coverings and  --  it was a beauty . ' Ehere was never anything like it . P123Lottie and her friend were playing , stopped a minute , kicked over the pile of spruce needles they had gathered and ran off laughing and turning backward to see the effect of their raid . They disappeared down the path . The girls came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . " " Oh go on , " said Gurlie . " Pick them up again . That 'll give you something to do . " The other little girl looked at Gurlie with her mouth open and went off with Lottie to pick up some more of the spruce needles . " You do n't worry about things , do you ? " said the woman to Gurlie . Gurlie laughed at her . " You 're German , are n't you , " said Gurlie . " You 're all alike you Germans . I wish I could find a four leafed clover . " " You do n't worry about nothing , do you ? " said the woman . Gurlie looked at her . " I do n't let things worry me , " she said . " If you read the Bible you 'll know everything that 's going to happen . " " Is that right ? " said the woman . " But I do n't know what to do about my mother . " " Oh , " said Gurlie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose it will . But she 's driving us crazy . She 's good , but I think she 's sick . She walks around at night and if the baby cries she picks him up before I can even get there . I do n't own my own baby . I supposeshe thinks of her own children , there was seven of us and we were always sick . I 'm sorry for her , but you ca n't talk to her . " " Why do n't you send her away ? " said Gurlie . " I would if I knew where to send her , " said the woman . " We 're all wrecks . I had enough . She picks on my little girl something terrible . But I 'm not going to let her spoil my baby . " " Have n't you got anyone else in the family you can send her to ? " " No , they 're all on the other side . " " Well , send her over there then , " said Gurlie . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . They lost all they had over there and she wo n't go back . " " Does n't she sew or knit ? " said Gurlie . " Oh she ca n't sit still long enough for that . She just wants to clean all the time . She says I 'm dirty . She says nobody knows how to keep house in this country . I tell her this is n't Germany but that do n't make no difference to her . She says the same things all the time . " " Does n't she read ? " " No . I wish I could be like you . Are you German ? " " No , " said Gurlie and began to look into the grass again . The woman looked down at the little patch of clover which Gurlie was examining and then leaned over a little to look up into Gurlie 's eyes , then looked down at the clover again . There were a few small white blossoms in the patch and a bee came and began to walk nervously over one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the woman , " he 'll sting you . " Gurlie laughed . " They wo n't hurt you . " " They sting , do n't they ? " " No , " said Gurlie and pushed the bee away with her hand . " Oh ! " said the woman drawingback . As she did so she turned her head and jumped up . There was little Flossie again with her hands in her mouth . " Crackie , cookie , cackie ! " she said as the woman came at her . A pleasant old man who was strolling by at
