A whole galaxy of cosmic ray experts gathered last week at the California Institute of Technology , Pasadena , to honor Nobel Prizeman Dr. Robert A. Millikan , 80 , principal discoverer and namer of cosmic rays . Dr. Millikan , who was spry enough last summer to travel by station wagon from Texas to Canada observing cosmic rays , described the gathering as " a testimonial to my longevity and a kind of celebration of my passage through the portal leading into second childhood . " <P> Dr. Millikan still sticks to his original long-held theory that cosmic rays come from the " annihilation of matter " ( atoms turning into energy ) somewhere out in space . He has elaborate evidence to prove his theory . The gathered cosmic raymen did not try to argue with their dean ; neither did they agree with him . Cosmic rays are a baffling and complex phenomenon . In spite of years of concentrated work , the experts do not even agree about what they are , much less about what causes them . <P> Big Smash . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are particles of some sort ( coming from somewhere ) that smack into the earth 's atmosphere with enormous speed and energy . They hit and apparently crack up atmospheric atoms , scattering the fragments violently , like bullets smashing into a bag of marbles . The atomic debris cascades toward the earth , some of the pieces with enough energy to crack atoms on their own . Occasionally one of these " extensive showers " covers an area 1,000 meters wide . The total energy in a shower runs up to 10 18 ( one billion billion ) electron-volts . <P> The experts are not sure what particle ( or particles ) causes this great commotion . Some think the primary rays are electrons which must be moving ( to have so much energy ) at almost the speed of light . But Dr. Bruno Rossi of M.I.T. presented a paper at last week 's meeting claiming that there are practically no electrons or photons ( high energy electromagnetic waves ) among the primary radiations . They are observed in the showers along with other particles , but Rossi believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is ) hits the atmosphere . <P> An average of over 100 cosmic particles of some sort pass through every human head every minute , according to Millikan , but they can not be felt . Elaborate special apparatus is needed to observe them . Some scientists work with stacks of Geiger tubes , which register each particle that passes through them . Others use special photographic plates , where certain particles leave microscopic tracks of silver in the sensitive emulsion . The best instrument , and the hardest to use , is the Wilson cloud chamber , where the particles make visible tracks of white condensed moisture . <P> Tunnel from the Sun . There may be many different primary rays . Some , thinks Dr. S. E. Forbush of the Carnegie Institution , may come from the sun . There are plenty of high-speed particles in the sun , but ordinarily they can not escape into space because of the sun 's powerful magnetic field . But sunspots , which are whirling solar hurricanes , have magnetic fields of their own . Sometimes these cancel the sun 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the particles escape . Dr. Forbush claimed to have observed sudden increases of cosmic radiation when such a tunnel happened to point toward the earth .
