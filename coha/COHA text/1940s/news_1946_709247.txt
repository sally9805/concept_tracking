txt Captain L. F. Safford , a Naval communications officer , asserted today that he had " more than a suspicion " that a " conspiracy " between the War and Navy Departments resulted in the destruction of all trace of what he insisted was an intercepted Japanese " winds code " message of Dec. 4 , 1941 , indicating the imminence of war with the United States . Testifying before the Congressional Pearl Harbor Investigating Committee , the captain , a slight , gray man , declared that he had " never indicated the White House " as a part of the alleged cabal , but said that a special representative of James Forrestal , Secretary of the Navy , in May of 1945 " attempted to make me reverse my ( earlier ) testimony regarding the ' winds . execute ' message and to make me believe I was suffering from hallucinations . " This officer , Captain Safford asserted , was Lieut . Comdr . John Sonnett . " It was apparent to me , " Captain Safford told the committee , " on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was acting as a ' counsel for the defense ' for Secretary of the Navy ( Frank ) Knox and Admiral ( Harold R. ) Stark ( former chief of naval operations ) rather than as the legal assistant to the investigating officer . " Commander Sonnett , the witness went on , was introduced as a legal adviser to Admiral H. K. Hewitt , who made a supplemental Pearl Harbor inquiry at the direction of Secretary Forrestal . " His ( the commander 's ) purpose seemed to be to refute testimony before earlier investigations that was unfavorable to anyone in Washington , to beguile hostile witnesses into changing their stories and to introduce an element of doubt where he could not effect a reversal of testimony , " said Captain Safford had begun in 1943 to prepare himself as a witness and that he had conceded at that time that his memory was " very hazy " on some details . Stating that Captain Safford appeared to stand abbe in his insistence that a " winds execute " message meaning war with the United States had actually been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final question of the day , thus expressed his skepticism : " I suggest that the reason there was no war warning message sent out on Dec. 4 , 1941 , was that there was no ' winds execute ' message . " " I disagree , " said Captain ? Safford . " Is n't it a fact , " Mr. Richardson had asked just earlier , " that every single witness on the winds code who has testified said that he never saw it ? " Questioned on " Conspiracy " " I do n't think the statement can be made as complete as ' everyone , ' " the witness replied . He added that Admiral Royal Ingersoll , former Assistant Chief of Naval Operations , had testified to having seen a " winds " message , but Mr. Richardson suggested that this was a communication admittedly received after Pearl Harbor , but referring to the Japanese attack on England . Referring to " the elusive winds message , " Mr. Richardson pressed : " You think there was a conspiracy running from the White House through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have never indicated the White House at any time , " said Captain Safford . " A conspiracy in the War and Navy Departments then ? " asked Mr. Richardson . " There is the appearance of it , " replied the witness . " Why , " asked Mr. Richardson , " would anyone want to fail to make use of a winds execute message that meant war ? What motive could he have ? " " Because that was the unheeded warning of war , " said the captain . " Who do you think took part in this ? " asked Mr. Richardson . " I have no first-hand knowledge . " " You have only a suspicion ? " asked the chief of counsel . " I have more than that , " said the witness . Mr. Richardson demanded supporting data " in words of one syllable , " and Captain Safford asserted that papers dealing with the winds code had " simply evaporated from the face of the earth . " f " Not only the winds message itself , but everything connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Safford conceded that he had told an earlier and secret Navy Pearl Harbor inquiry onl " third-hand evidence , " offered as such , that he had been informed that General of the Army George C. Marshall had ordered the " deH struction " of papers dealing with ' the winds code . " Do you now believe this ? " asked Mr. Richardson , in referring to the fact that the two services had apparently wholly cleared General Marshall of any suspicion of such an action . " That is the question I prefer not to answer , " Captain Safford replied . Barkley Raises Code Issue Chairman Barkley , Democrat , of Kentucky , asked the witness why it was , if War and Navy Department leaders had " destroyed " the so-called " winds execute " message , they had not also destroyed all reference to the model code , on which it was to be based , and which remained a part of the Army and Navy records . Captain Safford suggested that this was because it would have been " impossible " to make away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were received in the headquarters of Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel , then the Pacific Fleet Commander in Chief , and Senator ( then Admiral ) Thomas C. Hart , former Commander of the Asiatic Fleet . Mr. Richardson stressed in his questions the point , as he put it , that even granting the receipt of an " east winds " message , that is , one applicable to the United States , it would not , on the basis of the model code , necessarily spell out war . Turning to Captain Safford 's contention that all records of a " winds execute " message had been deliberately destroyed , Mr. Richardson asked : " In order to completely erase this message from the records of the entire military establishment it would first of all have to be erased from the files of the President 's naval aide ( then Rear Admiral J. R. Beardall ) ? " " Intercepts " were not left with the aide , Captain Safford replied , but were merely shown to him . " Someone would have had to go into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richardson asked . " That is correct , " said Captain Safford . " Some one would have had to go into the War Department and destroy the copy there ? " " That is correct , " the captain repeated . " Nothing on earth was more important than to find out when the Japanese would attack ? " asked Mr. Richardson . " That is correct , " said the captain . " Everyone in Washington , from the high command down through the subordinates , was watching for this message and asking to find out what the Japs would do ? " " That is correct , " the captain replied . Again demanding a " motive " for " hiding " or not employing any such message , Mr. Richardson was told by the witness : " That has puzzled me for four years . " " Has it puzzled you , " Mr. Richardson pressed , " because it is diametrically opposite to the theory you have , got in your head that there actually was an ' execute ' ? " By no means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " anyone " would choose to suppress evidence of Japanese intentions that would injure the Pacific commanders and the command at home alike , Captain Safford responded : " No . " But , he said , it was " human to try to cover up a mistake , " which , , he asserted , was a failure to accept the Japanese warning . " Then , " said Mr. Richardson , " the President ' of the United States , and all others , simply forgot that they were interested in the war and forgot to use this information ? " " I do not know why warnings , did not go out , " said Captain , Safford . WASHINGTON , Feb. 2 ( LID ? I John Sonnett , foiTnerly of the Navy and now an Assistant Attorney General , denied tonight that there had been any effort on his part , or on the part of anyone else , to get Capt . L. F. Safford to change his testimony in reference to Pearl Harbor . " My instructions from the Secretary ( of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts concerning the so-called winds message about which there had been so much rumor , " he stated . " I discovered that Captain Safford was the source of the erroneous rumors . ' " There was no constraint or pressure put upon him at any time to do other than furnish an accurate statement of his best recollection of the facts . " Mr. Sonnett added that it was significant that Captain Safford , in previous testimony , had named numerous persons as having knowledge of the " winds execute " message , but that all of these witnesses had no recollection of having seen or known about the message . " It is impossible , " Mr. Sonnett said , " to believe that all of these witnesses could be wrong . "
