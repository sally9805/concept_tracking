Nobody in the little ( pop . 6,000 ) Netherlands town of Borculo knows anyone in Warren , Ark. personally . Nevertheless , last month the farmers , laborers , and shopkeepers of Borculo felt a sudden close kinship with the citizens of Warren . Fat , jolly Burgomaster Paul Drost had just told them what he had heard from his friend Cnoop Koopmans , the Dutch consul general in New York . Warren , Koopmans wrote , had just been struck low by a tornado ( TIME , Jan. 17 ) . In Borculo there was scarcely an adult who did not remember vividly the time his town had met the same fate . <P> Lingerie on the Hedge . That twister ( one of the worst in Holland 's history ) tore the roof off every house in Borculo on Aug. 10 , 1925 . The people of Borculo never forgot how their town 's church bells turned up in somebody 's bedroom , and how a housewife 's lingerie , just unpacked , was found draped on hedges and window frames all over town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind died down , they had needed help badly , and help had come from many quarters . Now , they thought , it was their turn to help . Around a big potbellied stove in Harry Tijdink 's tavern , an " Aid Warren Committee " promptly met to talk it over . " At least , " said Drost , " we can show our sympathy in something more than words . " " Right , " agreed Farmer Jan Dave , as the campaign got under way . " Our help wo n't amount to much . But the nice thing is that it brings us all together and we forget our differences . " <P> Doughnuts in the Kitchen . Soon all Borculo was working side by side at the project . At the committee table , the white-haired Protestant dominee rubbed shoulders with the boyish Catholic priest , the leader of the socialist youth movement , and the bald-headed director of the bank . In Borculo kitchens , sweating huisvrouwen labored tirelessly , preparing thousands of doughnutlike oliebollen to sell for a quarter apiece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the night while amateur Borculo acrobats sought in vain to match Butcher Bertus van Puffelen 's marvelous tumbling feats . A crowd of giggling farm girls rehearsed a tableau vivant , and the village band started practicing The Stars and Stripes Forever . Under the leadership of hefty Grocer Albert Siebers , the rusty Achterhoekse Volksdansers ( square dancing ) society reconvened , to try out their old steps to the accompaniment of an accordion . <P> Last fortnight Borculo 's efforts in aid of Warren reached a grand climax in four separate variety shows . With admission fees and the oliebollen sale at intermissions , they grossed 2,200 gulden ( $830 ) , more than twice what the committee hoped for . Even that , Borculo admitted , would not help much financially , but already the villagers had a scheme in mind to spend it so that all the citizens of resurrected Warren might benefit . They would turn it to furniture for a public building . Cabinetmaker Groot Landeweer thought a sturdy oak chair carved with Borculo 's coat of arms would make a good item . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That , he was certain , could be turned into several lampshades that would be just right for Warren .
