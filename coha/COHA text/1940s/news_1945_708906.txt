txt If there was any doubt about the real state of mind of the Japanese ruling caste , the extraordinary Diet session , called to hear the Government 's explanation of the loss of the war , must have dispelled even the last illusions . At first sight , and in contrast to the fulminations of the Tojos and the Koisos , the speech of Premier Prince Higashi-Kuni appears to distinguish itself by blunt frankness coupled with liberal overtones . Japan surrendered , he explains , because the atomic bomb and Russia 's entry into the war had brought the nation face to face with annihilation . But he is candid enough to admit that Japan had been defeated long before these two developments . It was defeated because Allied , which means in the main American , power had blasted Japan 's cities and war industries , had crippled Japan 's maritime and railroad transportation , and had deprived Japan of most of the essential materials for warfare , in particular oil and coal , and even food . He even denounces the " policy of obscuration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of speech , publication and association to stimulate the ardor of the nation . But one needs no special knowledge of Japanese semantics to sense the fundamental attitude and ideology from which these words proceed . It is the attitude and ideology of the unregenerate militarist and imperialist who admits the loss of a battle but only in order to prepare for a comeback . ' According to the new Premier , it was the Allies who defeated Japan , but it was the boundless benevolence of the Emperor which saved the Japanese people from obliteration . In gratitude for this , the Japanese should frankly admit the " defeat of today , " and " with the broadmindedness befitting a great nation " carry out the Potsdam Declaration . But in contrast to the Allied terms , which put the Emperor under the authority of General as Allied Supreme Commander , the Premier still insists that the Emperor 's prerogatives as sovereign ruler remain untouched . He continues to speak of " Greater East Asia " ; he pays tribute to Japan 's allies who fought with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflicted heavy losses on the Allies , he exhorts the Japanese to build a new Japan " of peace and culture " in honor of her " heroes " whose barbarous atrocities are now being revealed ; and he concludes with a salute to " the future of the Empire . " But perhaps the most interesting admission , meriting the attention of Congressional investigators of Pearl Harbor , is his statement that the momentous question of war or peace was decided at the Imperial Conference of July 2 , 1941 , over which the Emperor presided in naval uniform . The likenhodd of such a decision was obvious at the time , and was stressed constantly , in so far as censorship would permit , in the Tokyo dispatches to this newspaper , especially after the conference was quickly followed by a general mobilization , by the establishment of the military Tojo Government , and by steadily rising crescendo of war propaganda and attacks on the United Rates and Great Britain , The Em ? eror 's fear of war , suggested by his relative , explains the last-minute mis3ion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public record could zeate any illusions about Japan 's real purposes .
