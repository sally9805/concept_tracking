Best Foot Forward ( M.G.M. ) is an effervescent edition of the Broadway musical hit by the young , of the young and , especially , for the young . It has almost the same cast , but Winsocki prep school has become a military academy ( uniforms look nice in Technicolor ) and who should be playing for the prom but Harry James , the Svengali of the Solid Senders . <P> Pretty , comical Lucille Ball , with her high pile of fiery hair , plays the movie queen who accepts an invitation to the Winsocki prom as a sound publicity stunt . This is immensely embarrassing to the kid ( Tommy Dix ) , who never expected his invitation to be taken seriously , and to his girl friend ( Virginia Weidler ) , who finds herself a wallflower while the cadet corps make Lucille the belle of a brawl . Before the end of it , she has been stripped to her slip by souvenir hunters and has ricocheted among as many closets as the heroines of French bedroom farce . But the fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the milk-fed energy of its participants . <P> Harry James and his band rock Winsocki to its foundations-the ballroom scene demands that the spectator love the Jamesian trumpet as St. Francis loved the birds . ( Harry 's rendition of Rimsky-Korsakov 's Flight of the Bumble Bee makes the old-fashioned trumpet solo sound like a first lesson in occupational therapy . ) But once the maestro parks his horn and takes the floor with bouncing , pint-sized Nancy Walker for a comedy dance which is the high point of the whole proceedings . <P> Background to Danger ( Warner ) stars George Raft and Sydney Greenstreet as opposing merchants of menace in neutral Turkey . Raft , as a patent-leathery G-man , comes into possession of a " Russian plan to invade Turkey " forged by the Nazis and intended to drive Turkey into Germany 's embrace . With these hot documents the fat Gestapo agent Greenstreet would like to warm his hands . But when he gives Raft the third degree on the subject of the papers ' hiding place , the G-man is rescued by a Russian agent played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a potentially terrifying trio . Unfortunately , they are not given a very ominous score to play . Lorre eventually gets killed off . Raft makes too many narrow escapes from Greenstreet for credibility . And , for the purposes of action , Greenstreet talks too much in his best English accent . <P> Heaven Can Wait ( 20th Century-Fox ) is a lengthy but frequently funny life history of an old New York skirt chaser ( Don Ameche ) from his brownstone puberty to his overripe old age . For years Director Ernst Lubitsch has been able to see more light touches in his cigar smoke than ever appeared in his scripts , and this Technicolored fantasy is no exception . The Lubitsch approach brings comic relief to such weary devices as the French governess , the son who is altogether too much like his wayward father , and the final personal interview with the Devil . When Lubitsch 's delicate invention lags , many spectators will be only too glad to concentrate on the Eastern beauty of Gene Tierney as the one true love of Ameche 's life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less , grow less weary .
