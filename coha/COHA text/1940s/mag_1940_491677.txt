Y OU can usually tell when a woman is angry . The minute Mrs. Martin Hamilton came into my office on the morning of September 14 , 1939 , I was sure that she was thoroughly mad . Her son , Martin , Jr. , followed her . " I 'm Mrs. Martin Hamilton , of Chicago . How do you withdraw from this university ? " The lady knew what she wanted . I urged Mrs. Hamilton to sit down , which she did with some reluctance . Martin , Jr. , had been on the campus for five days , participating in fraternity rushing . He had visited several of the best fraternity houses ; his father was a Beta Nu ; two of his uncles were Beta Nu 's . " Why , we have always taken it for granted that Martin , Jr. , would he a Beta Nu too . " And here was Martin , Jr. , and his mother , with first pledging dates over , no invitation to become a pledge of Beta Nu and , what was more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . " Why , it 's an insult to the boy . It 's an insult to his father . It 's an insult to our family . " There was no use to try to confer with Mrs. Hamilton while she was angry , She repeated the question about withdrawing from the university . I asked why ? She was sure that the place would be unbearable for Martin , Jr. , if he could not be a pledge at Beta Nu . Mrs. Hamilton 's feelings were injured , but she had forgotten one thing . Martin , Jr. , was coming to the university to become a freshman in the College of Commerce ; he was eligible to become a pledge to a fraternity , provided he found the right fraternity and was invited to pledge . But Mrs. Hamilton was looking at the situation from the standpoint that Martin , Jr. , had come to join Beta No and , as a sort of necessary addition , be a student in the College of Commerce . She had simply made the mistake that a good many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraternity or a sorority as more important than becoming a freshman in the university . It 's a matter of mixed fundamentals . Making Martin , Jr. , Happy AFPER all , her Martin , Jr. , was a good kid . Ile was a candidate for anyone 's fraternity , but just had n't clicked with the Beta Nu 's . So with her objectives slightly confused , Mrs. Hamilton had concluded that having missed Beta Nu , her primary objective , the secondary one , the university , was of no value to Martin , and the best thing for him to do was to leave . Up to that time , Martin , Jr. , had not had a chance to say a word , but it became apparent that he was n't especially heartbroken about missing Beta Ntt . In fact , he showed a suspicious interest in Psi Chi . Yes , lie would like to have a chance to see the Psi Chi 's . A telephone call to the Psi Chi rushing chairman took care of a luncheon date with that house ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night there , and attended his first Freshman Week meeting on the morning of September 15 , 1939 , with a Psi Chi pledge button in his lapel . Mrs. Martin Hamilton went back to Chicago and informed her friends that Martin , Jr. , had chosen Psi Cat rather than Beta Nu , was beautifully situated in the Psi Chi house ; somehow Martin , Jr. , did n't seem to care for the Beta Nu 's and he was just crazy about the Psi Chi 's . Everybody was happy ; Martin , Jr .. who wanted to be a Psi Chi , anyhow ; Mrs. I lamilton , who had convinced herself that the Psi Chi was superior to Beta Nu ; even the boys at Beta Nu were happy , for here was a legacy problem settled ; and Mr. Hamilton and the two uncles did n't give very much of a damn , fur they had all told Marlin , Jr. , to join whatever he wanted to join , if he got a chance . The National Interfraternity Conference adopted a. code of criteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code provided " that the primary loyalty and responsibility of a student in his relations with his institution is to the iieslifrtliwt . . . In other words , the National lnterfraternity Conference placed loyalty to the fraternity as secondary to loyalty to the institution . Ask any dean of men about the boy who ponies to college for the express purpose of joining a fraternity , and the dean will get red in the face . Ask the dean of women about the girl who is coming for the sole purpose of acquiring a sorority pin , and the dean will lift her eyehrows and suggest that perhaps the girl should get her objectives clarified . Actually , if the girl is coming to get a sorority pin , she probably hopes to acquire the fraternity pin of sonic likely young chap along with it . Ask the fraternity or sorority officers what they think about pledging the boy or girl who is coming to college for the express purpose of membership in a Greekletter organization , and they will tell you that unless that organization is Phi Beta Kappa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we do n't need these two-semester " graduates . " The situation of Martin Hamilton , Jr .. was easily solved , but it . should be said that things do not always work out as satisfactorily . When they do n't , there may be disappointment for the boy or girl , and heartaches for the parents . I watched a situation a year ago last fall . Sally Kerr , the daughter of one of the most prominent alumni of the university , was entering as a freshman . She had dates with half a dozen sororities . When the smoke had cleared and rushing and pledging were over , Sally had not been bid by Alpha Theta , her first choice , and did not care to accept a bid from another organization , which wanted her . The Alpha Thetas gave as their reason that , with their limited quota of members , they simply could n't take her after they had fulfilled their .. gaey obligations and had taken other els whose qualifications they consul , ? . ? ed superior to hers . Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Sally had other ideas . She came to the university to prepare herself to teach English . She had no intention of going home , took a room in a good private residence , and set herself to the task of her primary objectives . After one year , she had made a number of real friends in another sorority . Just before the end of her freshman year she was pledged and initiated . Sally 's sorority problems were worked out in time , through her making contacts with another organi- i ion . But there are always eases of individuals which do not reach settlement so easily . There arc boys who conic fully expecting to be pledged to fraternities , and girls expecting bids from sororities ; and when these pledge offers and bids do not materialize , they sometimes retire into a shell of disappointment. , hurt feelings , and wondering , " What is the matter with me ? " Miracle Workers Wanted Deans of men and women are often able to assist in such situations . I have no idea how many boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s at nut being pledged , and through a small amount of telephoning or letter writing I have been able to make other connections for them . The number is not large , but there are some eases every fall , and in general there has not been much difficulty in making arrangements for them to have other opportunities . I know that the dean of women has had similar success in taking care of girls who were disappointed at the outset . This does not mean to prove , though , that every case of the boy or girl who wanted to be pledged and was n't , can be settled by a call on the dean of men or women . Someone is always expecting some kind of miracle , and miracles went out of style about two thousand years ago . Too often , the parents are more disappointed than the youngsters themselves . Actually , Martin Hamilton , Jr. , was somewhat embarrassed , and told me afterward that he was sorry his mother " horned in " ; but explained that she meant . well and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same thing was true of the parents of Sally Kerr . They were all set for her to walk right into Alpha Theta , arid were more disappointed than Sally . These parental build-ups often explode with much greater noise than the student 's own anticipation which does n't materialize . The Overzealous Alumni Home-town alumni are often guilty of causing some of the most embarrassing situations . Dick Hansen is a good alumnus of the university and of Theta Omega . He informed me by letter last summer that he was bringing a boy down to take a look at the university and the Theta Omega house . They came , Dick and the boy , John Stevens . He was a handsome youngster , pleasant , and a good student . He had his date card filled with Theta Omega dates for the rushing season ; in fact , Dick had him so full of Theta Omega that he was n't really aware that there were any other fraternities on the campus . But when rushing time came , things began to happen . John was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was thoroughly fed up with Theta Omega . What should he do ? Dick Hansen would be very much put out if he didn't. pledge . His father and mother were expecting him to pledge to Dick 's fraternity ; he doubted if the buys would offer him an opportunity to pledge , and if they did , he did n't think he would take it . I did n't tell him that the president of Theta Omega had been in the office an hour before , to tell me of a boy who was being rushed , the prot6ge of one of their best alumni , who was going to be most powerfully peeved if they did n't pledge his boy . The boy 's name was John Stevens , a good kid , but they just did n't seem to hit it off . That one was n't so easy to work out , for Dick Hansen was much perturbed , and raised all sorts of thunder when he learned that John had not pledged anything until a week after the regular rushing season , when he pledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these terrific build-ups back home , the boy or girl comes to be rushed , and does n't pledge anything ; for it usually means a disgusted alumnus , a disturbed and disappointed youngster , and a chapter which needs the support of alumni , losing a good alumnus . The only way to cure it is to stop the buildups at home . Early in the summer of 1939 , Helen Pierson , the rushing chairman of Kappa Tau , began to get letters from prominent alumni about Alice Barnett , who was expecting to transfer to the university in the fall . Letters came from Kappa Tau 's , from fraternity members , then , as rushing came nearer , long-distance telephone cans and telegrams . It told of the beauty , the charm , the popularity of Alice , of the line standing of her family in her home town , of their comfortable cireurnstances . But no one ever mentioned the scholastic ability of Mice . Helen Pierson , the rushing chairman , had a keen ability to get at the bottom of things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many ? Why was all this pressure to pledge her coming from so many sources ? Helen did the smart thing ; she investigated the scholastic ability of sweet Alice , and found that she had graduated in the bottom fourth of her class in high school , that she had attended Midwestern College for a year and was dropped there for poor scholarship . She thanked each person who recommended Alice , then went to the north-shore suburb where the Barnetts lived , and had a talk with Alice and her mother . The outcome of this visit was that Alice and her mother came to the campus in August , reserved a room in the best dormitory and informed the public that they had decided that Alice should remain independent for a semester , until they could decide which sorority was the best . In contrast with Alice 's affairs , where too many recommendations kept her from pledging a sorority , is one of the finest examples of what a Greek-letter organization may do . In September , 1935 , an alumnus of Alpha Sigma at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , who was entering as a freshman . He would like to have his son pledged at his own fraternity , but knew this could never be . All he asked was that the boys at his house show any courtesies which they could to his son . The boy was intelligent , made fine grades , made a good appearance , but from birth had been unable either to speak or to hear . The father asked no quarter from the university , nor from Alpha Sigma for the boy . The Alpha Sigma 's brought him to the campus : they took him around to the various offices which he must visit , and after a few days of careful and courteous attention pledged him . Today he is one of the most popular boys in the house . We had a member of Phi Beta Kappa in the University of Illinois a few years ago , Jack Smith , who was also a member of Chi Rho , a good social fraternity . He was active in the house , attended all of its functions , dances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting conversationalist in the house . He was as respected as any member in his house ; he was totally blind . The Lead , PIpe System . Otto Kauffman came to the University of Illinois as a junior in the fall of 1927 , from Dresden , Germany . Otto will never read this article , for The Saturday Evening Post will not reach him in Germany . His father was a manufacturer of fine china in Dresden , and he came to the university to study ceramics . An alumnus at the Sigma Epsilon house wrote his brothers and urged them to show him any courtesies they could . Otto arrived and the boys helped him find a room , register for classes , invited him to take his meals at the house until he was situated , and to come in whenever he pleased . One Sunday he politely informed the house president that he liked the boys very much , and would like to become a member of the house . That had never occurred to the president , but he could see no reason why Otto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting , informed the chapter what had happened , and within an hour Otto was pledged . lie was initiated ; one of the boys said , after he left at graduation , " Otto taught the boys more about the qualities of a real gentleman than anyone ever had before . " You hear dramatic stories of the ruthless methods which fraternities and sororities use to get their man or their woman . The old lead-pipe system of rushing was just about what the name implied ; the freshman was overwhelmed with courtesy and flattery ; when he came to , he was pledged . The hot box of the older days was the method by which the boy was taken to the house president 's room , and the merits of No Mu were extolled by silver-tongued orators , who took turns talking until the will power of Willie Freshman was broken , and he could not longer resist .. The houses are not always so cold-blooded about pledging individuals as the stories would have you believe . What Bids Mean Ed Stanford , a freshman with everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned down five d the six , he had a talk with Bill Swenson , president of the Chi Nu 's . Bill intimated that his house would like to I have Ed as a member ; Ed said he liked the Chi Nu 's , but as long as he had known about fraternities , he had wanted to be a Delta Epsilon . When it came out . that Eel knew no one at Delta Epsilon , and was genuinely interested in that house , Bill took Ed to the Delta Epsilon house , introduced him , and two daes later saw Ed with the pledge button of Delta Epsilon . The terms " open " and " closed bid " are common at rushing time ; an open bid is an invitation to become a pledge , and the freshman is given an opportunity to think it over , talk to his parents , the dean , or anyone else he pleases , and decide at his own pleasure . The closed hid is a take-it-or-leave-it proposition ; the house invites the man to pledge , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone forever . - When Tim Erwin came to the university he brought with him a most unusual highschool academic and activity record . I le was rushed , was given closed bids by five houses , and turned them all down . Then he had three open bids from three more . Ile waited a week and then went to the Sigma Bela house , walked in , and told the president that he had considered the matter carefully , and would like to pledge Sigma Beta . He was pledged , is now a Phi Beta Kappa . Perhaps the Alvin sisters had as big a rush at . the Phi Gamma house as any two girls have ever had there . The reason was simple ; in addition to being attractive rushees , their grandmother was one of the founders of Phi Cia11111111 , when it was organized at an Eastern university sixty years ago . They were given the " works " by the Phi Gamma 's , hut when they pledged they went to the Gamma Kappa house . Such connections do riot always work out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and family tradition . The family tradition is a fine lb rig ; I attended a fraternity initiation last summer , where two fathers had come to be present at Chicago when their sons were initiated into the fraternity which the fathers had joined when they were undergraduates . It was an impressive ceremony when the two fathers stepped forward to pin the badges of membership on their own sons . But it does n't always work out that way . When Frank ' Pinson was initiated into Delta Kappa Epsilon at the University of Illinois , his father was a member of Chi Psi at Cornell , a brother was a Psi Upsilon at Kenyon , and another brother was an Alpha Delt from Illinois . Mrs. Clara McNamara is the national secretary of Tau Sigma and makes an annual visitation to her chapter at Illinois . She told me last spring that she would have a daughter in the university this year . I supposed she would be pledged to Tau Sigma and mentioned this to Mrs. Mc. * Namara . " No , she is not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set . She has never been a strong student , and I have told her that she must make her grades first , then , if she does well enough , may pledge if the girls want her . I 'd rather have her trying to make her grades so that she could be pledged than to have her pledged because I am a national officer . " Mistaken-for.Granted Most people around the campus would have taken for granted that the daughter of Clara McNamara would have been the No. 1 pledge at the Tau Sigma house this year . These taken-s for-granted cases sometimes cause no little embarrassment . Phil Sherman was taken for granted by the Beta Tau 's , because his father and brother were both Beta Tau 's . But they took him for granted , gave him only minor attention during rushing and considered him sewed up ; the Beta Tau 's came to after rushing , to discover that Phil had a mind of his own and was pledged Gamma Nu . Another type of taken-for-granted case is that of the boy or girl who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to the university for a big rush and fully expects to take his or her choice of fraternities and sororities . Mary Hanson won her home-state championship in tennis in the summer of 1936 . She came to the university in September , cocky and self-satisfied , had dates , and finished the rushing season all set to select the sorority she wanted . She was n't pledged to her choice , nor to any other one until late in the second semester , when , after a satisfactory personal deflation , she joined the Gamma Epsilon house , which had not rushed her in the fall . She is president of her house this year . Ben King was rushed by numerous houses in 1935 , because of his splendid high-school football record , good grades , and recommendations from many sources . But he was dropped cold by four good houses , when he announced that he was going to pledge the house which made him the best offer because of his promised football ability . What about the boy or girl who is an unknown , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no fraternity or sorority members to send is the name for rushing ? What chance has the boy or girl to get into a Greekletter organization ? Do they over get in ? How do they do it ? Swede Anderson is an orphan boy . He carried papers , worked for his board and room , and did odd tasks as a freshman . He found a better job in the newspaper office in his sophomore year and began to participate in some activities , particularly campus politics and student government . In his junior year he was pledged arid initiated by Chi Upsilon , one of the best houses on the campus . The house recognized in the man the traits of character which they wished to have in their members . I have never known a boy coming from less , having less , and operating on a closer margin , yet he was recognized for his own ability and personality . The Alpha Omega 's pledged a girl last fall who had no connections of any kind . One of the seniors in the house met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holmes , was not young , for she had stayed out of high school four years , taking care of an invalid mother . If you had seen her in September , you would n't have believed it ; in a day of skirt lengths at the knee or above , her skirts were ankle length . But she had other qualities , a most unusual deep , soft voice , a manner quiet , modest and courteous . This senior who met her decided at once that here was a girl . She was the No. 1 pledge of Alpha Omega , a girl who will get much from Alpha Omega , but will give them even more . Don Farrand was twenty-four years of age when he came to the university , having been in the United States Army before entering . He did n't know a soul , but he wanted architectural engineering . The Psi Chi 's discovered him through one of their own freshmen , who brought him to the Psi Chi house for dinner one night . Don was the best president the Psi Chi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two outstanding girls at the Beta Pi house in recent years who were not pledged as freshmen . In the same year , one was president of Beta Pi , the other was a member of Mortar Board . Jane Mattson , who became the house president , came from a little town in Southern Illinois , and was the first girl to come to the university from her high school in several years . She took a room in an independent house , worked in Women 's League activities for independent girls , made many friends , and was pledged near the end of her sophomore year . The Beta Pi 's elected her president of the house when she was a senior . The other girl , Joan Scott , who made Mortar Board , came as a junior transfer from one of the Eastern colleges for women and registered late . Rushing was over , and she slipped into a girls ' rooming house , practically unnoticed . Almost immediately she became active in the affairs of Women 's League , and in campus affairs generally . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her junior year , and nitiated in her senior year . An Unceasing Search There is a common belief that unless a studont is pledged as a freshman during rushing season , at the first of the year , he will never have much chance of getting into a fraternity or sorority . It is true that the major number of students are pledged during the rushing season , but the thought that the books are then closed is far from the truth . Rushing never ends . It goes on throughout the year . Some institutions limit pledging dates and permit pledging at certain times , but good fraternities and sororities are constantly watching for promising candidates for membership . Two primary reasons are behind this : The houses are always looking for strong students or activity leaders to add to their chapter rolls , and the houses are always trying to maintain a class balance  --  that is , a good distribution of members in all four classes . Phi Eta Sigma and Alpha Lambda Delta are the two freshman scholarship honorary societies , which recognize great academic promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is automatic , based on scholarship , and the day after the lists of members are announced there is a. rush on the part of fraternities and sororities to meet the members who have been elected and , if possible , pledge them . Premium for Leadership And rushing is never a dead issue for prominent leaders in extracurricular activities . Fraternities and sororities have been criticized for attempting to corral all activity leaders and trying to secure the major portion of places in student affairs . It should be a commendation rather than a criticism . The Gamma Delta 's have for the last five years pledged at least one senior who has made a place for himself in activities , particularly in the publications . In each case the boy had been intermi ested in Gamma Delta , and as an in dependent student had spent much time in the Gamma Delta house , had many friends there . The Alpha Theta 's wanted to pledge Betty Hammon as a freshman , but her parents objected , and would not permit her to have rushing dates with any sorority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. sophomore , 1 after she had made a good start in grades and activities . It is almost axiomatic that . when a student begins to show promise in activities , there will be an opportunity , or several , to become a member of a fraternity or sorority . Sometimes , however , it works out iu a different way . When Ken DeVon was pledged to Sigma Epsilon , he was a junior in the university and was almost certain of election to the presidency of the Student Union . The Sigma Epsilon house invited him to become a pledge , with the understanding that he would riot be a candidate for the Union presidency . They did not want anyone to be able to say that they pledged him because of his promise in activities . He pledged and did n't run for the Union . The second reason for the pledging of upperclassmen is to provide class balance within the houses . Not all students who enter a university graduate . Consequently , a freshman class will shrink from 20 to even 50 per cent by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert and on its toes will add sophomore pledges , juniors , and even seniors , in order to maintain this balance of upperclassmen . It has also been said that a working student , or one who is hard up , has no chance to get into a fraternity or sorority if he must work . Nothing could be farther from the truth . I suppose the Alpha Theta sorority considers itself about as good as any sorority on the campus at the present time and , based on grades , character of members , participation in activities , and excellent financial condition , it has a right to be proud . But just the same , six of the girls in Alpha Theta are working ; two as secretaries , two as sales girls in department stores , one in a book store , and one in the university library . Many campus clothing stores insist on campus leaders for clerks , feeling that each student who is working should bring a following of friends into the store . Independent leaders work side by side with fraternity leaders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves ? They do everything that independent men do , and the working boy need not fear that his work will prevent membership in an organization . It is unfortunate but true that in some cases where the student comes as a freshman , expects to be pledged , and is not pledged at the outset , the truth never comes to light . The girl who was all set to join Beta Pi , then did n't get the opportunity , knocks Beta Pi , and her parents condemn the sorority system . They forget to mention that Mary did n't get in because her highschool scholastic record was so poor that it is to the credit of the organization that it waits until Mary has made her grades before giving further consideration to her . What about the girl who did n't get the organization of her choice because a quota system of pledging limited the number of pledges at that house ? There is not much difference between the girl who did n't get into the house of her choice and the student who did n't get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except ? that the latter is a greater misfortune . Flow about the girl who wanted to get into the co-operative house , where she could attend at a minimum of expense , but which was full before her application was received ? We ca n't all be in Rotary or in the D. A. R. , and we ca n't all he President . What . R bout the Independents ? Quota systems sometimes disappoint students , but they prevent serious overcrowding of houses , and they tend to give a greater number of students the fraternity and sorority experience . The greatest difficulty when a student is kept out of one organization because of a quota , is to convince the student that an opportunity in another house can he just as satisfactory . There are plenty of cases on record where the student who was set on one organization and did n't get it at the outset , was willing to wait a little and get it later . This has been one of the chief arguments for the deferred rushing system . It is a fair question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join fraternities or sororities ? Is a permanent blight placed on their lives ? Are their college careers ruined ? Are they out of luck as far as campus recognition is concerned ? Can they participate in activities ? Certainly no permanent blight is placed on the student who does n't join at the outset , if ever . Sam Benson , an old-time Phi Beta , wanted Sam , Jr. , to be a Phi Beta eventually , but preferred to wait two or three months before he pledged , so that he could get his feet on the ground and have a look at some of the other houses . Was it true that Sam , Jr. , would have to pledge during rush week , or lose any chance of futuro pledging ? Sam , Jr. , was pledged Phi Beta just before the Christmas vacation . Doug Elliott came as a freshman several years ago , with a great reputation as a high-school athlete . He could have taken his choice of any fraternity he wished , but Doug 's father did not believe in secret organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a senior , Doug had many friends , had made good as a student and was captain of a major athletic team . His best friends were in the Psi Chi house and , though he never was pledged , he lived his senior year in the Psi Chi house . You hear stories about fraternity men ordering their freshmen to date only sorority girls , and even limiting the sororities to two or three very special ones . It 's a good story , but the facts just do n't prove the point , for independent men date sorority girls , fraternity men date independent girls , and they do as they please about it . The stories that independent men can seldom make the senior honorary society , or independent girls make Mortar Board , are also largely bunk . If there is a predominance of fraternity and sorority members on the lists when they are announced , it is for the reason explained before , that whenever a student begins to show promise in extracurricular activities , some organization is sure to be hot on his or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria , it stated that " these criteria should be applied in close co-operation with the administrative authorities of the institutions . Detailed methods of application will necessarily vary in accordance with the local conditions . " The recognition of these variations in methods of operation certainly applies to fraternity and sorority rushing . Ordinarily there are three types of rushing , open , restricted and deferred . Open rushing is unusual , for most local interfraternity and Pan-Hellenic Councils have agreed that some form of regulation is necessary . Open rushing means open season on rushees . Fraternities may pledge men if and when they can ; sororities may do tho same for the girls . Restricted rushing takes all sorts of special forms , depending on the individual college or university . In its best form , students are rushed during a restricted period just before registration , under specific rules , and with a dead line before which no pledging may take place . The theory back of such a plan is that it gives the freshman or rushee an opportunity to see several organizations before making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure the best candidates . The most conservative plan is the deferred rushing system , which is utilized in a few institutions at the present time . Rushing may take place under restrictions for a semester or even a year , but there is no pledging until the second semester or the second year . The arguments for the plan are that the candidates have a much better opportunity to make their decisions , and the disappointments of rush-week pledging are eliminated . The preferential plan may be added to either the restricted type of rushing or the deferred . Under a preferential plan , the rushees turn in sealed statements to a central office , stating their first , second and third choices of organizations . The fraternities and sororities also turn in their lists of invitations to the central office , giving in order the names of individuals whom they wish to pledge . The central office then matches up the students ' preferences with the invitation lists , and the bids are announced . The quota system may be added to either the restricted or deferred , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledging a cer- I lain quota of members , depending on the number it should have to operate successfully . It may be a complicated system , and oftentimes there are local restrictions which add to the complexities . It should always be remembered that pledging is only the first step to membership , and that every reputable college or university requires fraternity and sorority pledges to make their grades before they may be initiated into full membership . Martin Hamilton , Jr. , was pledged in September ; he must complete his academic work to the satisfaction of the university , for the period of the first semester , before he may be initiated . It is good that the fraternities and sororities have taken steps to accept their place in college and university life as au adjunct to the institution . The Fraternities ' Duties It is good that the organizations themselves have recognized the personal problems which arise out of every individual case of the student who is pledged . It should not be forgotten that large numbers of students are rushed and pledged and initiated , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never hear about their difficulties . Likewise large numbers enter and lead normal college lives without the benefit of either fraternity or sorority . The institutional opportunities are the same for either group , for the college and university must do for the fraternity man what it does for the independent man , and for the independent girl what is done for the sorority girl . It is the problem case , with the personal grievance , or the injured feelings , or the great disappointment , or the exceptional success , that makes the basis for the story . If the fraternities and sororities sat back complacently and took no interest in these problem situations , they should be subject to criticism as not fulfilling their duties in being a part of the educational system . Fortunately , the organizations have not taken this attitude and , instead , have taken the lead to try to change systems which have produced the problem cases , to eliminate the practices which have not been to their credit , and have asked the colleges and universities to advise and assist them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational systems . Fraternity or sorority life is not essential to the student , but if there is no fraternity or sorority life there will be a substitute for it in some form , either dormitories , organized houses or group systems . Fraternities and sororities are well established and are trying to do their share , not to make the institutions accept them but to make themselves more acceptable to the institutions . There are few of the problems of rushing and pledging which can not be solved by co-operation between the Greek-letter organizations and the administrative officials of the colleges and universities . Wherever there are people , there will be individual personal difficulties ; the human element is always present in college and university life , just as it is elsewhere . And with fraternities and sororities , some are called and quite a considerable number are chosen .
