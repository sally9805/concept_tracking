The largest and third largest Lutheran churches in North America both met for their biennial conventions last week and took a long step towards unity . On Monday the American Lutheran Church ( 571,545 members ) unanimously voted at Mendota , Ill. to establish " pulpit and altar fellowship " with the United Lutheran Church ( 1,714,945 members ) . If this works out satisfactorily , organic union will doubtless follow . <P> Because many U.S. Lutherans are farmers the Louisville convention passed an unusual resolution suggesting that each Lutheran farm family raise one extra cow to ship to stricken areas when peace comes .
