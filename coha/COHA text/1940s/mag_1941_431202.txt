It 's normal to be jilted . Ninety women out of every hundred have , at some time or other , loved a man who stopped loving them . It 's an experience that comes to the best of us . Even to a girl like Cleopatra . If some man has dropped you from his life with a dull thud , you are only one of a great sisterhood . We know just how you feel . It seems like the end of things . You 're lost and wretched , and his name keeps ticking away in your heart like a clock that wo n't run down . You think you 'll never get over it . Sheer nonsense , of course . You will get over it ? much sooner than you think . That 's what all the rest of us have discovered . Recovering from a man is n't easy . It takes grit and self-control . There 's a technique to it . A lot of women waste a pitiful lot of time and energy on recovery because they just bog down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if you follow a sensible program , you can get over any man in three months . After that , you may have an occasional pang , but you will be pretty much your normal self . This program depends on what your body does and on what your mind does . Both have to work together or you wo n't get anywhere . And you must be faithful to the program , day after day , even though it seems easier just to give up and do nothing . The first two weeks are the hardest . After that , you 'll find it easier . First of all , you must want to recover . Of course , you think you do ; but maybe you really do n't . Maybe you are hugging your grief and enjoying feeling sorry for yourself . Be honest now . Do you think of yourself as a tragedy queen ? If you do , snap out of it , or your heart will go on aching for years and you 'll be a deadly bore to everybody you know . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it are , and do n't let it fool you . Actually it is not so romantic as you think . As soon as you realize that at least two reasons for your suffering are not at all romantic , you 'll feel better . One reason is wounded vanity . You do n't need to suffer from it at all . You must get over the idea there is anything shameful about " losing " a man . For centuries women have been gullible enough to believe there is something wrong with them if they ca n't " hold " a man . Do n't be a sucker for that kind of talk . All you did was to meet a man who failed you . You are attractive and desirable . If you had n't been , he never would have loved you in the first place . You are still attractive and desirable , probably even more so , because you have learned a lot of things . Once you recover , you should have more allure than ever and a much better technique in handling men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of habit . That man was part of your routine , a habit in your daily life . Like cigarettes or candy or cream in your tea . You are suffering because it is hard to break any habit , even a small one . You 've got to give him up as if you were giving up sweets and starches . You miss him ; but you are better off without him , and every day you will miss him less . Another thing ? you must stop hoping . Do n't dream he will come back and stage a big reconciliation scene .  | That 's one of the worst things you could do . A lot of women set their recovery back for weeks , simply because they leap like startled fawns every time the phone rings . Once you admit your man has gone for good , you 've won half your battle . However , when you stop hoping , do n't think of yourself as defeated . Not for a moment . You 're a person who has been lucky enough to get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been unhappy for a lifetime . You are n't at the end of things but at the beginning . Heaven has been kind enough to give you another chance . This is your time to get ready for the next man . Do n't worry for fear the next man wo n't come along . He always does . But you must be ready for him . If your heart is still aching , if you have n't got free of the old love , you 'll be blind to anyone that comes along . No matter how fine he is , you just wo n't see him . So you must get into the state of mind and heart to appreciate the next man and have something to give him . Of course , in getting over a man , you have to carry out a program of action as well as straight thinking . You 've got to keep busy in a common-sense sort of way . You feel like not being interested in anything , like hiding away and grieving ; but you must n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make an effort . You must be practical , because women who are n't practical are the ones who wreck their lives at a time like this . A word of caution . Do n't unbosom yourself . Do n't go around to your friends  | and burst into tears and get petted . The more you talk about your troubles , the more important they get to you and the deeper scars they leave on your mind . If your engagement was known to your friends , and you have to tell them it was broken off , tell them in one sentence and then stop . Let them wonder just what happened . It is much more clever to arouse their curiosity than their pity . If you feel you must tell somebody , take paper and pencil and write the whole thing down , from beginning to end . Then burn what you have written . It 's a wonderful relief to your feelings , and it 's absolutely safe . Another thing you must n't do is telephone your ex-beloved or write him or meet him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of thing you set your recovery back . As they say in boxing , break clean . Spend as much time as you can away from a room with a telephone in it , because the sight of a telephone seems to aggravate all your symptoms . You will cry sometimes . Of course . But here is where your self-control comes in . Do n't let yourself cry too long . Do n't cry in too comfortable a place , such as lying on your bed . Cry in a hard , straight chair and you 'll be able to control yourself better . However , if the tears just keep on flowing , make yourself go out someplace where you ca n't cry . Or take a warm bath , manicure your nails , wash your hair . Any little routine task will steady your nerves . IF YOU have a definite job to take your mind , you are fortunate . If you have n't a job , get one , even if it 's an unpaid job . There are always places women can work if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some job that will take you among people less fortunate than yourself , people who think they are blessed if they have food and shelter . Get out among the poor , and you wo n't have time to mourn and you 'll be ashamed to , anyhow . When you were in love , you were absorbed in your man and yourself . That was only natural . Your mind turned inward . Now you must turn your mind outward . Get interested in as many other things and people as you can . Change your routine . Experiment . Take a course in some new field you 've never tried before ? costume design , drama , typewriting , tap dancing , arts and crafts . Psychologists say it is important for a woman with a heartache to do some work that involves the use of her hands . At any rate , you should get physically as well as mentally tired . If you find that only your mind gets tired , go in for exercise . Not long , lonely walks , because you can do too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Try sports . If you have a car , drive a couple of hours a day through heavy traffic . You 'll find it a great relief , because you wo n't be able to think of a thing but the steering wheel . Schedule your day . Never let yourself wake up in the morning and wonder what you are going to do with your time . Make out your program the night before . However , in spite of all your activities , you will still find time to think of him ? even though the spaces between such thoughts will grow mercifully longer . If you must think , do n't just go to pieces and moan . Take stock of yourself . Figure out just why he failed you . Was it all His fault or were you peevish or selfish r too demanding ? If you honestly think  | it was partly your fault , use your energy , not in regrets , but in conquering the sort of thing in yourself that estranged him . Did you run after him too much ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to do it again . Get wise to yourself . Be cleverer next time . Take stock of your body , too . This is the time to give special care to your appearance . Do n't let yourself look rundown . Do your hair a new way . Ask some make-up expert if you are doing the right thing by your face . As soon as you can , get rid of the clothes he admired . Some people think a jilted woman should go whirling out to big parties . This is a mistake . When you have a heartache , there is something very desolate about a crowd . You see it in a kind of blur , and it makes you lonelier than ever . It is more comforting , at least for the first month , to go out only with a few close friends . Evenings spent playing bridge with opponents who wo n't let you relax are very good medicine . Do n't try the big parties till the second month . All forms of art are a great consolation . Especially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see . Do n't go in for dismal stuff . Avoid screen romances . Listen to music , unless you find it goes in one ear and out the other while you go on thinking the same old thoughts . If that 's how music affects you , do n't keep it on your program . Books are excellent . Of course , at first you may find yourself reading the same page over and over . But that stage will pass after the first two weeks . Read the kind of stuff you really like and that grips you . Even if it 's trash . Read anything except poetry , which will make you feel soggy . After a while , you 'll want to graduate from trash . Then you 'll find the great books are your best standby . Read history , because it gives you a sense of how little and foolish your troubles are in the great sweep of time . Read biography and discover how all the famous people have suffered and turned their sufferings into blessings for the rest of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , times when none of us can afford to be self-centered . REMEMBER ? in these months of recovery ? you are not just trying to keep from thinking of that man . Your purpose is deeper , more constructive than that . You are giving your mind some air , living outside yourself , being released from your wretched little self-absorption , becoming a bigger person for your next adventure . It is not enough just to fill your hours . You must have a sincere desire to make yourself into a woman more worth having and keeping . Do n't worry if you have relapses . In the third and four weeks , you will get on very well for a couple of days and think you are cured and feel very proud of yourself . But along will come a rainy afternoon , and you 'll slip back into that old feeling . Do n't let it discourage you . Relapses , if you are faithful to the technique , will be fewer , easier to take . Some morning , inside of three months , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't matter to you any more what he does or where he goes or whom he meets . You 'll be free of him , and you 'll be so glad of your freedom that it will be worth the pain it has cost you . Good luck , sister !  |
