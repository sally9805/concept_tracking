The newborn baby seemed normal . But after two days it began to vomit , cried &; tossed in its crib , was seized by convulsions and fits of holding its breath . These all suggested symptoms of a drug addict suddenly deprived of his drug . <P> The baby was indeed a drug addict , born to a drug-addicted mother . After birth it was suffering the usual symptoms of an addict deprived of morphine . <P> This horrifying case , proving that drug-addicted mothers produce drug-addicted babies , was reported last week by Dr. Meyer A. Perlstein of Chicago in the American Medical Association Journal . Said the doctor : " Separation from the maternal circulation shuts off the supply of drug to the newborn . . . . " If not treated , the baby may die of convulsions within a.week . Dr. Perlstein used a standard treatment for drug addiction-sedatives . Tapered off the phenobarbital after eight weeks , his baby patient emerged safely from its morphine jag .                @ @ @ @ @
