As the Allied invaders rooted deeper into the private life of Hitler 's Reich , they bared some nauseous Nazi secrets : <P> Slaves &; Skulls . In an insane asylum near Limburg they discovered a " murder factory " for " mercy killings . " One of six in Germany , it had been set up for the disposal of unruly and overage slave laborers . Some 15,000 were gassed and cremated before nearby villagers complained of the polluted air . The next 5,000 were poisoned . SS men performed the daily executions . They celebrated their 10,000th killing , staffmen said , with a bacchanalian orgy , using the scoured skulls of victims as brandy flasks . <P> Only the sane were slain . The others were let loose in underground dungeons that dripped water , echoed to the flapping of bats ' wings . Reported an Allied officer who visited the dungeons : " Crazy men , dwarfs and giants jumped at us . They laughed and screamed and followed us around in packs . " <P> Some Still Breathed . In a concentration camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stacked in an acre of ground . Most were dead , but among them lay men who still breathed . G.I.s who had fought across Europe stared incredulously . A brigadier general turned away . <P> Burghers &; Beasts . At a concentration camp in Ohrdruf , which few of Ohrdruf 's burghers had ever been allowed to see , the Americans shared their horror . They took the Brgermeister and 40 citizens to the camp , to see the hundreds of bodies sprawled in pits , piled against the walls . The Germans found it hard to believe . Conceded one : " It 's the work of beasts . " That night the Brgermeister and his wife hanged themselves .
