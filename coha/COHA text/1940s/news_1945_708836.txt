txt The bomb that dropped on Hiroshima was doubtless heard by human ears for hundreds of miles around , but morally it was heard around the world . Its implications for good or evil are so tremendous in so many directions that it will take months before our minds can really begin to envisage them . Today men can only think haphazardly of a few of its possible consequences : the effect on the war against Japan , the effect on the future of all warfare , the peacetime applications to power and economic creation , the scientific and political revolution that it must bring . For a revolution in science and a revolution in warfare have occurred on the same day . Atomic energy released , a bomb that has more than two thousand times the blast power of any bomb previously used in the history of warfare  --  all this , and the enormous secret preparations that Went into it , read like some incredible fiction . But in the bewilderment that such a stupendous announcement must bring , one consequence stands clear . Civilization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mankind 's political thinking . Since the Industrial Revolution that began about two centuries ago and has developed at an accelerative pace , each great war has been more disastrous than its predecessors . But this fact has still not prevented mankind from resorting to war for the settlement of differences . It did not affect the childish and irresponsible minds of the Mussolinis and Hitlers . With the horrible prospect of utter annihilation opened by the atomic bomb , it is hard to imagine how the people of any nation on earth can possibly want another war . But can mankind grow up quickly enough to win the race between civilization and disaster ? Or will new would-be conquerors arise who will see in the atomic bomb merely the certain means for the instant realization of their dreams ? Will they whisper to their own people , or the few whom they choose to take into their confidence , that they will be perfectly safe , and the new war will be over immediately , if only they get in the first blow ? Will they , by suppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be able to drag their people into war regardless of how their people feel about it ? These are the possibilities that mankind must now forever prevent . If we are to do so we must change our accustomed ways of thinking far more rapidly than we have ever had to change them before . It is fortunate , indeed , that this country has already ratified the United Nations Charter . But it is more obvious than it ever was that this is only a first step . Tremendous tasks remain to be done without loss of time . We must begin systematically to reduce , and eliminate if possible , all the chief causes of war . We must carry on the battle against international trade barriers , and still more against the twisted economic reasoning that leads to the creation of such trade barriers . We must extend the geographic range of democracy . We must bring every pressure that we can to confine or eliminate dictatorships and despotisms wherever they may exist in the world . We must do this not primarily for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that consideration is , but primarily for the protection of the rest of the world . We must assume that no people will want war if they realize what its consequences with the atomic bomb will be . All that we have to fear , in that case , is that a totalitarian government , by suppressing information and free discussion , by feeding its own people on a propaganda of lies , will prevent its people from knowing the facts until it is too late , while it plots secretly against the rest of the world . Wherever the press and information and discussion are free , whereversthe facts are known and the government is really the choice of a liberated people , that people will want peace and can fort its government to keep the peace . But the atomic bomb is already hen The mentality and the national an world political institutions necessar to make certain that mankind get only the immense benefits , and not th unthinkable destruction , that this grey discovery can bring , must be create without delay .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
