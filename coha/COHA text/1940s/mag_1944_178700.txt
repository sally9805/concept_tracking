FUEL <P> The 1,640,150 oil-burning homes on the eastern seaboard will get enough oil this winter . There will be enough oil , in fact , so that the nearly 200,000 citizens who patriotically converted from oil to coal-and then found there was not enough coal , either-will soon be allowed to convert back to oil again . <P> The expense of reconversion ( average cost per unit : $35 ) will pay off in comfort . For coal users will not be able to keep warm this winter unless 1 ) the weather is mild ; 2 ) they spread the thin supply skillfully . The prospects : <P> Fuel Oil is up because of better transportation distribution ( chiefly pipelines ) . Production has caught up with military needs . If all the former oil users reconvert this winter , oilmen can supply the extra oil which will be needed , but only 30% are expected to reconvert . <P> Coal , the No. 1 U.S. heating fuel , is getting scarcer every day , although production is up nearly 6% over last year .

This means that eastern and southern homes will get 10% less coal this year than last . But better distribution may help coal burners to get by . <P> Wood , used for heat on farms and in scattered rural areas where anyone can get it , is not a general problem , except in thickly populated western Washington , half of which uses wood for fuel . With many lumbermen now working in war plants at higher pay , the area was 200,000 cords short this year . To persuade farmers and amateur woodsmen to make up the difference , the Government offered a subsidy of $2.50 a cord to anyone who would work in the forests . In eastern cities and suburbs , where householders use fireplaces for supplementary heat , wood was scarce and expensive .
