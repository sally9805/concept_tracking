In the paneled quiet of the Papal Cancelleria last fortnight , eager-eyed young priests leaned forward on elbows shiny from desk-reading ; ascetic monks stretched thin necks from their lowered cowls . All sat raptly silent along the wainscoted wall , while speaker followed speaker at the highly-polished wooden reading stand .
