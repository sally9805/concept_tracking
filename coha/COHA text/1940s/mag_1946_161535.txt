As in almost every other major crisis , President Truman permitted his deadlock with Congress over OPA to come down to the last minute before making a decision . Then he took a long gamble . <P> Last week he had an extraordinary session with his Administration leaders in Congress . The price bill they brought him - after the fizzle of Senator " Pappy " O'Daniel 's eight-hour filibuster-was , by their own admission , a dud but they agreed : it was the best that could be had . At least , it saved rent controls . <P> But Harry Truman , throwing caution to the winds , decided to veto the bill , even though it meant an almost complete break with his party leaders in Congress . <P> The veto message was blistering . With one eye on politics , Harry Truman singled out and named his villain of the piece : Ohio 's Republican Senator Robert Alphonso Taft . It was Taft 's amendment providing price increases for manufacturers based on profits in prosperous 1941 ( plus subsequent costs ) , said the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounting to many billions of dollars . " This , wrote the President , was the " mainspring " of " an impossible bill " that " provides a sure formula for inflation . " <P> Strong Terms . Deliberately , in an effort to frighten Congress , the President stated his case in strong terms . He predicted that under the Taft amendment the prices of automobiles would immediately rise $250 ; those of washing machines , 30% ; etc . <P> Bob Taft was quick to reply : " Utterly unfair . . . a partisan political attack . . . . In the Act . . . the President received complete power to prevent speculation and speculative increase in prices and all increases in rents . . . . He chose to take all the chances of chaos , followed by speculative rises in prices . " <P> Harry Truman 's justifications for his veto were not new . Chester Bowles , who resigned as Economic Stabilization Director last week in an evident move to strengthen the President 's veto hand , had made the same arguments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <P> If Politician Harry Truman had counted on Congress picking up the cue and becoming his supporting cast in a last-minute rescue , he soon learned his mistake . Within a few minutes after hearing his message , the House-by a margin of 38 votes-sustained the veto . The Senate turned down a resolution that would have extended the present law temporarily . It required unanimous consent-and Texan O'Daniel immediately objected . At midnight , 34 hours later , OPA died . <P> To the People . Could it be revived ? Harry Truman made his follow-up play : he took his case to the people in another last-minute radio appeal , asked that they apply their pressure on Congressmen " to prevent inflation . " An avalanche of telegrams descended on Washington ( the White House reported that its wire score was 50 to 1 in favor of the President 's action ) .
