txt By Cable to Ms NEW YORK TIMES . LONDON , Aug. ** four years France has seemed to people in this country as remote as Mars . But today this correspondent went there as comfortably and as casually as any business man flying from New York to Boston . Logically there is n't anything so terribly re-/ markable about that , considering that about 1,000,000 American soldiers had preceded me there the hard way . And yet there is something so fantastically unreal about today 's journey , which ended with dinner in London this evening , that it is worth reporting about to fill in the picture of the battle zone behind the forward-sweeping armies . It was a little bit like my first visit backstage . I got a glimpse of the scene shifters , stage hands and electricians who contribute their unseen parts to the drama unfolding before the eyes of those in front of the footlights . Here were the men and machinery behind the // lines , whose toil and sweat had made possible the victorious lightning thrusts Of our armies toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil  --  the cratered grazing land , the smashed little gray farmhouses with their red roofs , the rolling table land like Ohio , the red soil like Georgia 's  --  brings a lump of sentiment into one 's throat . Here is France , liberated from the Germans by American blood . In Cherbourg a faintly synthetic sentiment vanishes before real homesickness . For this is not the France of old . As one GI put it , it is not France at all but a " European Theatre of Operations of the United States of America , temporarily a forty-ninth State of the Union . " French people , mostly old men , women and children , are so outnumbered they seem like aliens in their own land . Street signs and traffic directions have been all supplanted by painted signs in English . Public buildings have been converted into staff headquarters , press headquarters and soldiers ' theatres . The idiom of the street is not that of France but of Harlem , of the prairie , the South and the mesas of the Western plains . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ' of Cherbourg . Here and there is a gendarme in a faded blue uniform , but far more numerous are M. P. 's in their white helmets , directing an unending two-way procession of trucks , going to the front loaded and returning to beaches empty , for the most part with Negroes at the wheel , Captives Clean Up Debris Hundreds of German prisoners , who have volunteered to work for their captors for pay , are busy clearing up the rubble and mess they left when they tried to demolish the port of Cherbourg before they surrendered . Many of these Herrenvolk are guarded by Negroes with carbines and machine guns , but they seem quite happy with their lot . For them , as for the people of Normandy , the war at last is over . It was a brief but comprehensive visit that took us not only to Cherbourg but over miles of dusty roads , through Volognes , Ste. Mere Eglise and other little villages where only a few weeks ago battle raged so bitterly , and by air to several landing strips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German lines we could see Le Havre clearly through a light overcast . Never once did we see an enemy plane or hear a shot fired in anger . All along the road leading to Cherbourg traffic rolled two ways r  --  heavy trucks , jeeps and ambulances , a fast-moving conveyor belt between American industry and the fighting front . We saw oil from Texas and Oklahoma being pumped from tankers into pipelines that grow in length each day as engineers extend them to keep pace with the ever-advancing front so that our mechanized equipment can be suckled as readily far inland as at the beachhead . We saw amphibious " ducks " I rolling down cement ramps into the water empty , swimming rapidly out to Liberty ships two miles offshore and roaring back with one-and-a-half-ton loads , leaving a feathery white wake behind them . We saw locomotives made in America rolling off tracks of ferries onto tracks of French railroads , hauling all kinds of American rolling stock especially built for the job . In Cherbourg itself we saw little snub locomotives from Schenectady and Berwick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all manner of equipment , from iron pipes anll insulated cable to canned food and reading matter for our troops in the forward areas . 1,000,000 Items Needed Lieut . Gen. John C. H. Lee , the genius of logistics behind the little GI Joe at the front , said there were between 700,000 and 1,000,000 separate categories of supplies our liberating Army had to take with them into France . One regiment of troops in this present-day warfare has to have some fifty-odd varieties of ammunition , for instance , and the trick is to build up a balanced stockpile , which means foreseeing the kind of fighting that will develop as operations progress . We flew over both the British and American beaches with the artificial ports of which Prime Minister Churchill spoke so fleetingly in a recent speech and of which nothing more can be said for security reasons . Offshore lay Liberty ships and other oceangoing vessels , anchored almost at closely together as the invasion armada on D-day . All of them were disgorging from their holds vital materials of war that were being ferried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuff is going in now through Cherbourg but the beaches are still of vital importance , and with winter coming on the problem of supplying the huge armies now battling in France makes the capture of Brest a first priority . As that port is garrisoned by fanatical 1German paratroopers it probably will be necessary to kill most of them before it is ours . Men Try to Beat Schedule Here on the beaches and in Cherbourg men are working according to plan and straining themselves to exceed it . Few of them will die and even fewer will get any medals or other official recognition . But these are men whose shoulders are behind the wheels of motorized equipment rolling German forces back toward the Rhine . They are the merchant ? seamen , the men of the escort ships , the Negroes who drive the " ducks " into the water and unload them ashore , the engineers who make roads safe , lay railroad track and build roads into the fighting zone , the doctors and nurses who care for the wounded and the countless others who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible for swift , steady advances to be made .
