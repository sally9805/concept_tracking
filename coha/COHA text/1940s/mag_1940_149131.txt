One day last week suave , hard-driving Lewis Allen Weiss , vice president and general manager of the 31-station Don Lee Broadcasting System network on the Pacific Coast , sat in his Los Angeles office listening to Adolf Hitler address the Reichstag ( accompanied by a running translation into English ) . An ex-cavalryman , Vice President Weiss soon began to get sore at Hitler . Presently , after chewing a fat cigar to tatters , he remarked to his assistants : " This is the damndest program I 've ever heard . This guy Hitler is a slicker . " Thereupon , he popped into his secretary 's office , dictated a two-sentence statement , stomped down a corridor to the master control room of his key station KHJ . Thrusting his statement upon a startled announcer , he barked : " Read this and flip the button . " Promptly over the Don Lee network went the following : <P> " The management of this network is of the opinion that it is not in the public interest nor in harmony with the attitude of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler from Germany . We feel sure that our American listeners will concur in our opinion that Mr. Hitler should not be permitted to use our American facilities to justify his crimes against civilization itself . " Soon deluged with telephone calls was KHJ , most of them from citizens full of praise for Squelcher Weiss . Then Berlin was heard from . D. N. B. , official German newsagency , had denounced Weiss 's shut down as " unprecedented and brazen . " Hit ler 's Press Chief Dr. Otto Dietrich coldly notified MBS that until the episode was satisfactorily explained the Reich would permit no broadcasts from Germany and German-controlled areas over the whole Mutual network with which the Don Lee chain is affiliated . Although MBS frantically pointed out to Berlin that all of its network ( 140 stations ) had been offered the speech and that it had no jurisdiction over individual affiliates , at week 's end the Nazis were still frothing.
