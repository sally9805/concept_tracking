Covering his 25th Kentucky Derby last spring , Hearstling Sportwriter Martene Windsor ( " Bill " ) Corum gratified his readers by picking the race one-two-three-four . Hereafter they will have to depend on someone else for their forecasts . Easygoing , fireplug-shaped Columnist Corum was named last week to succeed the late Colonel Matt Winn ( TIME , Oct. 17 ) as president of the American Turf Association and Churchill Downs , i.e. ) impresario of the Derby . <P> Missouri-born Bill Corum , 54 , who makes close to $100,000 a year from his writing and his drawling broadcasts , will get an estimated $25,000 more just for promoting and running the Derby . He will continue his syndicated column for the New York Journal-American , but readers will get no more of his spring racing columns . During April and May his typewriter will be covered ; Bill Corum will be in Louisville filling the job that old Matt Winn had held for 47 years .                    @
