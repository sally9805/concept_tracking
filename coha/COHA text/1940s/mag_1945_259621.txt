Confidential Agent ( Warner ) is in the best tradition of Warner Brothers ' socially significant melodramas . Inspired by Graham Greene 's excellent anti-fascist thriller , the film has all the thrills and some of the political indignation of the book . <P> Incorrigible cinemaddicts may insist on regarding Charles Boyer as a romantic figure-even in his shabby overcoat and battered hat . But the hero of Confidential Agent is far from a stock heroic figure . He is middleaged , greying , easily winded and persistent rather than brave . A Spanish Loyalist soldier whose wife and child have been killed , he is sent on a confidential mission to England in 1937 to keep a shipment of coal out of the Nationalists ' hands . He is beaten up , shot at and framed for murder . He is chased up dusty stairways and down drab , foggy alleys . He wins out mostly-through stubbornness and luck . <P> His luck takes the angular form of Lauren Bacall , who is cast as a British coal tycoon 's bored daughter . It is unhappy casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too far too fast . Neither a great beauty nor a great actress , her voice and facial expressions , both limited , soon grow monotonous . She is not even the interesting personality which careful direction made of her in To Have and Have Not . <P> Miss Bacall occasionally remarks in a loud monotone : " I hate melodrama . " Her protest does not , in any sense , stop the show . All the supporting players do their jobs efficiently . Wanda Hendrix stands out sharply as a downtrodden little <P> London slavey . Peter Lorre , Katina Paxi-nou and Victor Francen are a very nasty gang of despicable villains . And Director Herman Shumlin has polished up a gallery of minor characters that are as balmy and memorable as any Hitchcock ever thought of . Notable examples : an intense old professor who has invented a new language as a means toward international peace , and a Hindu " mass observer " whose love of irrelevant facts helps solve a crime . <P> This Love of Ours ( Universal ) is a <P> tearful series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-suffering father and a beautiful , misunderstood mother . At almost any point in the plot , most of the complications could have been ironed out easily . But none of the characters will stop looking noble long enough to make a few simple explanations . It 's as if everyone were afraid of letting the story down . <P> And a reminiscent old story it is . A musical comedy star ( Merle Oberon ) sprains her ankle and is treated in her dressing room by a handsome French interne ( Charles Korvin ) . Ah , Paris-with the horse chestnuts in bloom ! Miss Oberon 's touring troupe moves on , but she has decided to be a poor Parisian housewife . The years slip by and Dr. Korvin obviously is n't getting rich at his research ; but Merle seems happy with her wifely chores and her roly-poly daughter . Very suddenly , one day , Dr. Korvin suspects his wife of infidelity , and without asking for explanations , he runs off with the baby .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
