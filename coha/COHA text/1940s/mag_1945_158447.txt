The 19-year-old marine , veteran of Iwo Jima , lay aboard a U.S. hospital ship , dying of a malignant growth in his throat . <P> Last week New York Timesman Meyer Berger told the story : " The amputation cases lay silent . . . in the red glow of the battle light in the ward . Shipboard sounds seemed remote and subdued as the chaplain bent over the fever-flushed youngster . The chaplain said : ' Do you want to pray with me , son ? ' <P> " The sick youth gave no sign that he had heard . His eyes were closed and he breathed with difficulty . The chaplain began the Lord 's Prayer : ' Our Father , who art in heaven . . . . ' Behind him the amputees took up the prayer . . . but the dying boy seemed not to have heard . He still fought for breath . <P> " The Chaplain paused a moment . Then he pronounced the words of the Twenty-third Psalm : ' The Lord is my Shepherd ; I shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastures ; He leadeth me beside the still waters . . . . ' <P> " The sick boy stirred . His eyes opened briefly , then , heavy-lidded , fell shut again . It seemed he tried to speak . ' He restoreth my soul , ' the chaplain continued slowly . ' He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name 's sake . . . . ' <P> " The fevered lips parted and sounds came from them . They did not sound like words , but the young marine had caught the thread of prayer . Thickly he followed the passage : ' Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil ; for Thou art with me . . . . ' <P> " His breath held to the prayer 's end . Then his blond head rolled sideways on the pillow in utter exhaustion . . . . "
