Almost every U.S. manufacturer even remotely concerned with war production is this week cudgeling his brains to button up his material needs into one quarterly package : WPB 's statistical white hope , " Purp " ( the Production Requirements Plan ; TIME , April 20 ) . <P> WPB still does not know what has become of the scarce materials on which it has issued priorities . If &; when it gets all the priority records set up the Purp way ( whereby material uses for the past quarter and needs for the coming one appear on one huge form ) , it will at long last begin to know the answer to that one . How much more it will have advanced towards rationalizing the use of rationed materials still depends on the Army &; Navy , and on how tough WPB is ready to be . <P> Last week there were two strong indications that neither of these central problems had yet been solved : 1 ) Don Nelson was reported to have asked the President to choose between him and the armed forces as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WPB pushed two new high-preference ratings ( AAA and AA-1 ) into the bottlenecked top of its priorities alphabet . Including AA-2 , there are now three emergency-preference categories ahead of the highest priority rating , A1a.
