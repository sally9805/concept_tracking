In Chicago , Denver , Kansas City , New York , eight other U. S. cities last week , hundreds of children and younglings seated themselves at pianos , pounded for dear life . Some had memorized as many as 20 pieces . Ear-weary judges , sitting behind screens so as not to fuss the youngsters . heard everything from The Happy Farmer to full-length concertos . The National Guild of Piano Teachers had been holding such local " Auditions " since last April . By next week , 10,000 piano students in 92 cities will have tinkled their stuff . Almost all will get certificates , suitable for framing . on which various colored seals and stars indicate ratings from " commendable " to " superior . " Best players get their names on district , State and national honor rolls . Mighty proud are their parents ; proud are their teachers . <P> The National Guild and its tournament were the bright ideas of a slow-spoken , quick-thinking Texas music teacher named Irl Allison , who started the whole thing on a shoestring in 1929 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guild , Mr. Allison was once down to his last 7 . Today 2,000 members pay $3-a-year dues to the Guild , and Mr. Allison is permanent president . Guild members get their names in an annual directory , their pupils in the Auditions , which this year brought in some $15,000 in entrance fees , cost $4,000 in judges ' pay ( $10 a day ) and railroad fare . <P> U. S. piano teachers , soft-pedaled by Depression , are inching back toward their 1929 level , 1,500,000 pupils . Their ranks ( an estimated 100,000 ) still include many a teacher of the sort that flourished a generation ago : dowdy females who had studied with a pupil of a pupil of Liszt , made their rounds with brief case under arm , eked out a living playing the organ in church . Women teachers still outnumber men , io-to-1 , although men get thrice as many pupils . A good teacher today tends to be younger , better-trained than those of the previous generation . She gives about 20 lessons a week , makes about $40 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert career .
