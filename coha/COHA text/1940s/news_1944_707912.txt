txt A suggestion that the British government appeal to the United States to send more troops abroad so that British forces with years of overseas service can be given leave today was turned down by Maj. Arthur Henderson , war ministry spokesman , in the house of commons . The suggestion was made by John Dugdale , a Laborite , who raised the subject of soldiers ' leave at the end of the day 's house session . " We are sharing the burden of war ' with our American allies and intend to share it to the full , " he said . " But should we bear more than our share ? " Are n't Toil Willing ? " " American troops come back on leave after far shorter periods of service overseas than ours do . I ask whether it is n't possible to say to the American people , ' We are determined to pull our weight but at the same time are n't you willing for us to shorten the period of service abroad for our troops to something more like your level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more Americans have to serve abroad ? ' " Dugdale said he thought that Americans served abroad two years , but Henderson answered that as far as his ' advisers knew there was no specific period of service for United States army men . Qualifying Period Cut . The qualifying period for leave in the British army , Henderson said , has been reduced from seven to five years ' overseas service . A number of men with four and half to five years ' service have been brought home and since October 26,009 have returned to the United Kingdom from India , the Mediterranean , and other theaters , he added . Henderson emphasized that there was little prospect of the period of overseas duty being reduced at pros . ent , inasmuch as the man power position is likely to become more rather  --  than less difficult when the large number of men sent overseas soon after the outbreak of the war are qualified for leave .
