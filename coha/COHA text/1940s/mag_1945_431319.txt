 | Nothing is worth doing unless it is worth doing well . .. Always finish what you start . How many of us reared in the puritan tradition , which still permeates the American home , have been bombarded with these two little maxims ever since . we can remember ? And how many of us are still , unsuccessfully , trying to overcome their regrettable effects on our conscience ? I , for one , hereby and forever reject these mottoes inflicted on my youth . I rise to a point of disorder and exclaim fervently , " They lied ! " Having struggled under the shadow of this early teaching and finally escaped into the clear light of middle-aged compromise , I feel thoroughly prepared to prove that low aim is not always failure . My new campaign for imperfection , like charity , shall begin at home . Nothing is more satisfying , more of a joy in living , than a beautifully kept . comfortable home . But the whole is more important than many of its parts . Granting that basic cleanliness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice and necessity , relinquish any attempt to attain perfection by spending hours I can not afford on such details as polishing every piece of silver or straightening each closet and dresser drawer until it could be part of a model house at the next World 's Fair . I shall keep brightly gleaming the silver I use , put the rest of it away and forget it . I shall keep ' my dresser drawers in sufficient state of order to find what I 'm looking for -- but that is all . After all , I want my home to be a place where everyone , including me , can relax and enjoy living , and impeccable , superhuman housekeeping does not necessarily achieve that comfort . I do not wish to emulate a friend who so loves perfection of detail that she snatches the ashtray , empties and scrubs it , almost before the smoker has put out his cigarette . Far better an overflowing ashtray and a happy guest . I know too many wives and mothers who heckle their husbands and children in their aim for perfection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitality than for its exquisiteness , and I 'm perfectly sure , knowing my own limitations , that I ca n't have both . And having accepted my own imperfections , I no longer can expect other people to do everything well . Some wives expect such perfection from husbands that it drives them quite literally to drink , or at least to outside approval . And some mothers estrange their children permanently by  | expecting perfect school marks , perfect manners , perfect care of clothes . Perfection in all these things is wonderful if it can be achieved without unbalance or a nervous breakdown , but usually it can not be . As to finishing everything one starts ? that is a completely pernicious doctrine , and I hereby toss it over my shoulder . This may or may not be treason ; it is certainly revolution . Why , only recently I discovered that you do n't have to finish a dull book-that , in fact , you 'll be much better off if you stop wasting time on it . You do n't have to finish building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many and the materials could be better used some other way . You do n't have to finish a job of sewing if you see that the dress will come out badly and that you will have to spend more money than it is worth . Many , many things are not worth finishing , and clinging to the doctrine all too often conflicts with another old , but more practical , saw : Do n't throw good money after bad . And all too often we start things that were a bad idea in the beginning . When the mistake is obviously irremediable , why not stop right there ? Why go through with the farce of finishing it , just to prove you have a sterling character ? Ah , you say , perhaps in a home there is room for these minor relaxations , but surely not in an efficient office ? On the contrary . In every office , perhaps even more than at home , little chores demanded of each person do have to be done , but not so well that there is no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine colleagues used to spend so much time typing reports on cards and filing them that he had no time to work on articles . No one ever looked at his astonishingly , needlessly complete card file , because the rest of us were too busy getting stuff ready for the printer . In every office there is a mass of paper work that may have to be done , but most of it can be done with far less effort than is put into it . Very often efficiency is the result of cutting corners , skipping nonessentials , and even by-passing a good bit of hitherto traditional labor . Rejecting the dreadful dogmas that haunted my childhood will make my social life easier , also . You do n't have to entertain only when you can do it with perfect food and drink and service . If most of us wait until that time , we 'll have the pleasure of our friends ' compony sometime after the millennium . I shall not worry further because I do n't play bridge like Culbertson or dance Iike Fred Astaire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my partners fairly content , and I shall have even more fun than I have had before with these recreations . I seem to be sponsoring a campaign of slackness , of doing things carelessly , of ? worst sin of all ? incompleteness . For all this I have a reason , however , a reason that may seem just as perverse as my impertinence in recommending that we cease our unthinking clinging to the old slogans . There is only so much time in a life , and by deliberately neglecting the little things , I can save my abilities and my energy and my enthusiasm for the really important things . There are big things to do and wonderful things to enjoy , and I intend to put them first in my life . Because when I consider those things of real value to me , I revert right back to the code of my ancestors , and I say earnestly and eagerly : " These are important concerns to me . I must do them well , and I must leave myself energy and time to finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
