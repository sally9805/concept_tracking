txt HARD NORSE TASK IS SEEN BY BRITISH They Admit the Germans ' Have Taken First Trick , ' but Are Ready for Finish Fight By HAROLD DENNY Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES . LONDON , April ** of reverses recently suffered by troops trying to prevent German forces from linking up their positions in Southern Norway have given the British people a rude shock , but have not shaken the British determination to fight it out on the Scandinavian front no matter what the cost . Even though earlier reports from Scandivanian sources of smashing Allied victories on land now are seen to have been exaggerations , there appears to be no lack of confidence in high quarters of an eventual victory that will cripple Germany  --  but responsible military officers know , as they have from the first , that it will be a long , hard and dangerous campaign , In which they must expect to suffer defeats and disappointments . What has happened in Scandinavia thus far now is quite clear . The Germans stole a march and , as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Allies Paying Penalty Whether the Germans ' established themselves in Norway because of failure of the British Intelligence Service , or failure on the part of the military authorities to act in time to forestall this , or whether they were impeded by an exaggerated Norwegian desire to preserve neutrality , is not yet clear . But anyhow the Germans got there first and the British now are paying the penalty of having to act swiftly and with inadequate preparation . " The Germans , having invaded neutral country unexpectedly and by treachery , had an advantage over the British , who naturally were not prepared to adopt such tactics , " according to one explanation voiced today . " The British had to send out mediately what troops they had at // HARD NORSE TASK IS SEEN BY BRITISH // hand . Tie main idea was to get out troops as quickly as possible to assist the Norwegians , who had been taken completely unaware . The Germans had taken the principal ports . The British had to use undeveloped ports with inprovised facilities , and naturally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take with them only what they could carry . " It is one thing to land by treachery in well-known ports with the best possible facilities and another to land wherever one can with the object of turning out fully established troops . " In the matter of supplies , the Germans must be supposed to have the advantage at present . In the matter of air bases , Germany also has the advantage because on the first day the Germans seized five of Norway 's six air bases , the sixth being too far north to be of use . They also have at their disposal those taken over from Denmark . These are being bombed and shelled , however , and their use is being made difficult . " A sense of proportion must be kept . With the situation as it is , risks are inherent and must be accepted . The longer the delay in the British appearance on Norwegian soil , the greater difficulties would become . If the Allies had waited , the whole of Norway now might be in German hands . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized there would be difficult times at first , and indeed in certain parts of Norway troops are having a bad time . But that will not affect the determination of the Allies to go on with the job and see it through . " It seems to be quite well established now that the first British troops went ashore without antiaircraft guns and little in the way of artillery . But it is said today that these lacks are being remedied and that reinforcements , both in men and equipment , elements of an expeditionary force in Norway six days after the Germans ' surprise occupation . The speed of that operation with all its inescapable cost was important not only from a military standpoint . It was vitally important from a political standpoint also . Some neutrals are wavering , apparently waiting to see which side is most likely to win . There is Italy , for instance . These neutrals had seen Poland gobbled because Britain and France could not get to her to help . Finland collapsed though the Allies were whole-souled for her . Allied prestige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a blow struck for her . And so , though it meant soldiers wading ashore in primitive harbors with only the guns they could carry to face the superior forces of a well ; established enemy , the Allies calculated it was worth it . -  - -  - Two Objectives Set Up LONDON , April 26 lin  --  The Allied strategy was crystallizing today as military men began to fit together the pieces of information . Two jobs lay before the British , French and Norwegians , who , despite reinforcement in the last two days , still were believed inferior in weight of metal and number of planes to the Germans . First  --  and largest  --  was to block German reinforcements approaching the Trondheim region from Oslo along railway and mountain roads . Major Gen. Adrian Carton de Wiart , commander of the British Expeditionary Force , was expected to rush reinforcements to the troops south of Dombaas to this end and to counter German air attacks with Britain 's Spitfires and Hurricanes , which have found precarious bases on ice in hidden fjords . Trondheim , the main base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of Allied attack . Before its strong German garrison can be fought successfully , however , it was believed here , the British Navy will have to account for German destroyers in the fjord , whose fire helped roll back the British advance guard Wednesday at Steinkjer . Campaign in Preliminary Phase Wireless to Tim NEW YORK Tiaras . PARIS , April ** Norway the Germans have possibly five or six divisions , say 60,00 ( men , distributed over a wide area , observers here estimated today . These divisions have all their material , both light and heavy . But they can not be reinforced except by risking serious loss en route . The Allies , on the other hand , began by landing advanced guards and light material to bring immediate help to the Norwegians and to make contact with the enemy . They are still landing their heavy material , and with mastery of the seas they can continue landing all they need . This summary of the situation after two weeks of the campaign was given from an authorized military source . In these conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought and it is absurd to speak of " great battles " or " strategic movements . " For the time being the operations are limited to tactical engagements on various fronts , none of which is continuous , thus permitting infiltrations by both sides . Consequently names of localities and distances covered have no particular significance . A village occupied in the morning may be evacuated by nightfall , while light mechanized columns may advance many miles only to fall back when they meet opposition . I- brief , military operations in the full sense of the phrase are merely beginning and neither side has yet engaged its main bodies .
