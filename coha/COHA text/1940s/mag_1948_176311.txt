During the wartime food shortage , researchers noticed a curious thing about the health of chickens . Well-housed chickens , deprived of animal-protein foods , began to droop and look sickly . Chickens living in dirty , littered henhouses did all right , even on a poor diet ; but when the henhouse litter was cleaned up , they began to droop too . This was especially interesting to six Lederle Laboratories researchers who guessed that something in the chicken litter was supplying some mysterious factor the chickens needed . <P> What was it ? The researchers isolated one microorganism after another ; they cultured each and tried it out . Last week they reported in the Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine that they had found a chicken dung culture which produced the same effect as liver extract in patients with pernicious anemia . <P> Samples of what they called " animal protein factor " have been tried out on patients at Western Reserve University 's hospital in Cleveland . Two aged women , extremely ill with pernicious anemia , ' responded as well as patients respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time , a laboratory has produced from commonly occurring bacteria a substance with anemia-treating properties , and pernicious anemia patients are freed from the ups &; downs of the meat market . Liver extract , obtained from cow livers , varies in quality . The new product will eventually be mass-produced and comparatively cheap . The animal protein factor has proved that it clears up the blood damage in pernicious anemia . Still to be answered : does it repair the nerve damage that is frequently part of the disease ?
