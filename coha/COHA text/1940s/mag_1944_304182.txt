Major-league baseball 's electric-light bill this year will be close to $60,000 . The 197 night games scheduled ( 106 in the American , 91 in the National ) will be the most in major-league history . Reason for the increase from 156 last season is the lack of daytime customers . Fans not in the armed forces are working in war industries during the day . <P> The Washington Senators have the top total of 43 night dates , playing every weekday night from May 10 to the close of their home season Sept. 17 . Washington was granted this special privilege because Government workers can not get away from their jobs in the daytime . The St. Louis Cardinals and Browns will be permitted 21 night games each . All other teams equipped with lights are limited to 14 night games at home . Only major-league teams without lighting equipment are the Chicago Cubs , Boston Braves and Red Sox , New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers . <P> Despite statistics which prove night baseball to be a financial lifesaver , many baseball men , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major leagues in Cincinnati , fear that so much of it is dangerous to postwar business . They are afraid that baseball patrons will grow to expect such backbreaking schedules as doubleheaders on Sundays and holidays and games every night in the week . Another worry is that children , less likely to attend night than day baseball , may not get so interested in the game . <P> Most players do not like night baseball . It disrupts their eating and sleeping . Many fans are against it because they think the action is distorted by the lights . The game , they say , looks faster than it really is . Batted balls appear , from the stands , to be traveling farther than they really do . <P> The lights , actually , do not bother the players . The illumination with modern equipment is so good that a man reading a newspaper on the field would find himself supplied with ten times as much light as he would get from an ordinary reading lamp . If otherwise distributed , the lamps in the clusters atop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamps in the Brooklyn ball park , for example , furnish the equivalent of 92 million candlepower . The cost of operation is approximately the same as it would be for lighting 1,500 homes for the same length of time .
