The world was in a frightful condition on the night of Dec. 26 , 1942 , but the place where 22-year-old Army Lieut . John Meredith Langstaff sat seemed remote from strife . He was sitting on a San Francisco park bench on Nob Hill . With him was a pert , leggy girl named Diane Guggenheim , 18 , of the copper Guggenheims . <P> He proposed . She said yes . Next day , in hard sunlight , the bench still seemed a thing of excellence and charm . Before leaving the city the young couple took off their shoes , gravely lined them up beneath its slats and took a picture of it . <P> Fortnight ago San Francisco 's swank Pacific Union Club received a letter from the debarkation hospital at California 's Hamilton Field . It read : <P> " Dear Sir : This letter may seem to hold ... a strange request . . . but I am in earnest . I am an infantry line officer . . . wounded at Okinawa . I am anxious to buy one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the . . . club . A couple of years ago I became engaged to a New York girl one evening while sitting on it . We were later married and before I went overseas I . . . got to know a small daughter . I have always promised myself that I would try to get the bench for our garden in our home in New York . I hope you understand . . . . John Langstaff , ist Lieut. , Infantry . " <P> Enclosed was a sketch of the park , an " X " designating the bench . <P> Transactions of this nature are seldom handled in the Pacific Union Club . And anyhow , the park belongs to the city . Nevertheless the club 's manager asked Club member Lewis Lapham , the mayor 's son , to do something about it . Lapham took the letter to the city Park Commission . <P> The commissioners engaged in a decent interval of protest and speech . Finally , beaming , they agreed to send the bench , and even ( despite Langstaff 's insistence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of shipping themselves . Then they discovered that the bench had been removed from the park . They organized a search , discovered it , among some discarded machinery , in Golden Gate Park . <P> Last week , disassembled and crated , it was on its way east to be installed in Lieut . Langstaff 's tiny yard on Manhattan 's East 62nd Street . And in both the Pacific Union Club and the City Hall a casual visitor might have been puzzled to observe a fleeting and apparently inexplicable smile on the faces of some solid , civic and all-too-greying men .
