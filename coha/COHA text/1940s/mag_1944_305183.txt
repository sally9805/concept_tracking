In his home near Hollywood last week , the gentlest , most poetic of U.S. popular artists laid down his pen at last . George Herriman , 63 , creator of the sovereign comic strip , Krazy Kat , died after a long illness . Hundreds of thousands of readers , who knew the love-daft Kat and his curious companions as well as they knew their own dreams , knew little or nothing of their inventor . But as friends and colleagues talked of this modest little man , as he never on earth would have talked of himself , a figure of almost Franciscan sweetness emerged . " If ever there was a saint on earth , " said warmhearted Harry Hershfield ( Abie the Agent ) , " it was George Herriman . " <P> Willie Was Right . Herriman wandered into newspaper cartooning because a fall from a scaffold made house painting too strenuous . He wandered into his greatest comic creations because an office boy named Willie , amused by a casually drawn cat &; mouse playing marbles , suggested that Herriman flatly reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Herriman 's fortune ( around 1922 ) , he left Manhattan , settled down in the West . For the past 22 years he lived near Hollywood . After his wife 's death a decade ago in an automobile accident , he stayed much at home with his daughter Mabel , his dogs , his work . <P> Herriman believed that animals are superior to human beings . He would never ride a horse . He tried to be a vegetarian , had to give it up when he became too weak . To the end of his life nearly all his ration points for meat went to satisfy the sleek gang of stray dogs and cats he took care of . <P> Poker and Solitude . He was rather a dandy , in a loud way . His favorite sport was poker . He could be a wonderfully entertaining host . William Randolph Hearst loved him . His own close friends were chiefly comic-strip artists - Hershfield , Ru dolph Dirks ( The Captain and the Kids , Jim Swinnerton ( Little Jimmy ) , the late TAD Dorgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late H. M. ( Beanny ) Walker , Our Gang comedies director . <P> Toward " serious " artists he felt very humble . He used to try painting and , according to Dirks , invariably underestimated his own work . He never got over feeling that his $750-a-week salary was more than he was worth , never got over trying to make each strip a little better than the last . <P> He loved solitude , would often sit among people for hours without saying a word . The one thing Herriman could always talk about fluently and without shyness was Krazy Kat . <P> Minor Master . Herriman was crazy about Krazy Kat . In all his years of inti macy with him , he never got tired of the Kat . In Herriman 's 30-odd years of work - always wearing his hat and usually improvising fresh from the pen - he must have drawn something like 1,500 full-page Kats and 10,000 strips . An amazing number of them are the keenest , dizziest kind of inspiration .

" Delight was Herriman 's strongest point in a world where most artists had lost it .
