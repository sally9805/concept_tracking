txt Men 's suit manufacturers are going to fall short of their production goal this year by about three to four million garments . It 's not a raw wool shortage . It 's not a worsted cloth shortage . It 's just that jobhunting workers are avoiding suit factories like fleas avoid a cast iron dog . They do n't like the pay . They do n't like the work . Manufacturers are panicky . With suitstarved U. S. manhood hammering at their doors , they find the " no help " blight tieing their hands . A Wall Street Journal survey of the five leading cities where suit manufacturing is largely concentrated  --  New York , Rochester , Philadelphia , Chicago , and Baltimore  --  shows how real the blight is . Manufacturing Cities Surveyed , it is estimated that about 9,000 to 5,000 more workers are needed , including 1,000 highly skilled tailors . Philadelphia manufacturers say they need 4.000 just to bring them up to their pre-war level of around 17,500 . The clothing industry in Rochester , N. Y. which employed 20,000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 14,000 . Baltimore suit makers declare that they could easily use 1,000 more workers , and particularly bewail the dearth of skilled men . In Chicago , the Hart , Schaffner &; Marx firm alone needs 1,000 more workers . The company employed 4,000 before the war , now has only 3,300 . All this boils down to a labor supply for the industry as a whole about 15% to 20% below the pre-war level . It means that instead of making 28 million men 's spits this year , as they had hoped , manufacturers will turn out about 24 or 25 million  --  or perhaps even less . 40-Million-Suit Demand Seen A production of . 24 million , suits is as good as the best ever done-in any pre-war year . The only trouble is that clothing men see a demand for 90 million . In addition to normal demand . they are thinking of 12 to 15 million men trying to rebuild civilian wardrobes after two to five years iri uniform . Manufacturers are n't in complete agreement on how much they 'll miss their 28-million production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York firm of Max Udell Sons &; Co. , thinks the lack of labor may knock four million from the hoped-for total . Meyer Kestnhaum , president of Hart , Schaffner &; Marx speaks of the industry attaining a 25-million-yearly production rate . But others think the loss from the worker shortage will be more painful . Some Baltimore manufacturers fear this year 's production will run 20% below pre-war levels . In Philadelphia it is pointed out that production in that city has been running about 75% of pre-war volume . Most Rochester manufacturers say their output is still below the 1939 level . Skilled Personnel Needed The want of key , skilled workers unbalances production . Manufacturers get cloth " cut " for suits  --  then bog down for lack of people to do the sewing-together job . " It used to take four to six weeks to make the garments after cloth was cut , " says a New York manufacturer . " Now it takes 12 to 18 weeks to complete the suit after cutting . " And others tell the same story . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into the right places , " says a Baltimore executive , " we could increase production 50% . " The " no-help " plight of clothing makers is laid to several factors . Wages are unattractive compared to many industries . Sewing ion coats and pants is crowded out in " glamour appeal " by newer industries such as radar , aircraft , and radio . Immigrant tailors , who have always been the core of the skilled labor force , are getting old and dying out  --  without replacements . Significantly , the average age of male workers in the textile field is now 57 , the highest in history . " IL 's hard to get young people ' to work at $30 a week when they can get $20 unemployv ment compensation for doing nothing , " emphasizes one clothing maker . Eight Prejudice Against Mirk Manufacturers do their best to break down the idea that a garment factory is not an attractive place to work . But the results are depressing . " We have taken prospective workers on tours of our factory , " sighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We have shown them how light , airy and clean It is and how pleasant the working surroundings . But it does n't click in getting them to accept jobs . " As a case in point , Mr. Lebow cited : " A class of 22 school girls , majoring in power sewing operation , was recently taken through the plant . I got an opportunity to address the girls ; made an offer to employ those who wanted jobs . Three gave me their names and addresses , saying they wanted to work . But I have n't heard from one yet and their visit took place several weeks ago . " But getting people to work in the milt factories is just half the job . Keeping them " once they 're got " is just as tough . The turnover is giving employers dizzy spells . 50% Leave Their Jobs Rochester manufacturers report only about 50% of the newly hired help stay on the job . The rest leave after a few weeks . " Turnover is killing us , " says Stanley Sagner , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could but maintain our would on payrolls , day in and day out . we would have no trouble keeping production at MO levels . Rut we are turning out 2,000 units weekly when we should get one fourth more . Absenteeism and turnover reduce possible output by 255 at least . " The labor supply is so tight in Rochester that many firms there have gone outside the city to set up small plants . principally for needlework , in surrounding villages . These little plants employ from 50 to 300 persons . The system has helped some , but still ! caves manufacturers with far fewer workers than they need . Also in an effort to relieve the squeeze . suit makers have instituted various programs for training new workers ; but these efforts have brought little relief so far . Where workers will be found to fill still more suit factories now being built is anybody 's guess . In Rochester , Bond Clothes has a $ million plant under construction . Michaels-Stern and Hickey Freeman have expansion programs under way in the same city . Demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,000 within 12 to 18 months .
