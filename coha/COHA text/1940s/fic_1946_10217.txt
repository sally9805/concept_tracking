THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS " music " suddenly issued from the open door of its shadowy interior , and there was a burst of rough laughter and an oath particularly vile . " They 've got the biggest juke box in Coaltown ! Its sides light up with blue and red when it plays . You can see it from here ! I would sometimes watch those lights from the sidewalk . I thought they were magical ! I should have practiced dancing like the other girls ! Then I would n't have been such a trouble to you ! " More laughter and another oath from the saloon . " Kid , " he said . " Poor little kid ! " Several women were now trudging past , carrying bundles of supper marketing  --  women with expressionless , flat faces and flat bodies . " These are the women of my town  --  they 're not really old  --  it 's the hard life  --  washing eternally mine-begrimed clothes  --  cooking over hot coal ranges for big families of hungry men  --  bearing children  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like them !

Still , even when I was away , and before I went , I always wanted to come back sometime . I dreamed that maybe I could cheer them up a little with a song  --  some poetry about the hills " " Olga , kid , " he said , " I did n't realize . I did n't really know . Why did n't I find you then , my darling ! " " It 's all right , Bill , " she seemed to say . " You came along at . just the right time . And do n't mind all this . This is the town .

Bill Dunnigan felt his hand relax . She was gone . She was in that coffin behind him in Orloff 's " parlor . " She lay there with the noise of the Breaker and the blatant tones of the juke box with the red and blue sides pounding against her unhearingears . He knew that . He had known that all along . But this was where she had wanted to come . This  --  and the cemetery that went with it  --  was where she was to spend eternity ! THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 41The cemetery might be all right , but before he could achieve the cemetery he must go through the ordeal of interviewing another citizen of this miserable place  --  the priest of Olga 1 reskovna 's church . The church with the ridiculously long name ! He could see that church up the street and across the way . " The wooden one that needs painting , " Orloff had said , and there it was . This priest was doubtless another hopeless case  --  mean , lazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor sap , " Orloff had describedhim . " Does n't know how to hustle for the dough . " But he would have plenty of financial acumen , Dunnigan surmised , when a stranger appeared  --  a stranger in city clothes . He 'd get all the dough in sight ! Well , he , Bill Dunnigan , would gladly pay . So long as the cash lasted , he 'd pay ! He wanted no favors from such people . He just wanted to finish with it all and get away . Olga Treskovna would understand that . She 'd be nearer to him even back in the Venus Burlesque Theater than here ! Would it have been different if he had taken her in his arms that night when they left Ming Gow 's ? Taken her East with him ( if she would have come ) , let him care for her , protect her ? Would it have been different even if he had answered her letters after that meeting in the midwestern city ? " Stop it ! " he said to himself . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain things . At least she had had her try . And what a try ! Even if it ended now in Orloff 's Funeral Parlor . She would not have found happiness trouping with a press agent from city to city . Or alone in a hotel room back in New Yorkwaiting  --  waiting . No . The other way was how it had been fated to be . He had passed up the street and paused opposite the dozen wooden steps that led up a steep embankment  --  from the sidewalk on the other side  --  to the front yard of the Church of St. Michael the Archangel . It seemed a pathetically small church , perhaps a story and a half high , topped by a triangular roof that met at a point well up above its center . This roof seemed too tall , too heavy  --  as if a too large hat were pushed down on the head of a fragile man . Being on a plot of raised ground , the building rose quite a hit above the houses that flanked it . It did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MIRACLE OF THE BELLS brown in color . And it seemed to set a little crookedly  --  to lean  --  as if it were very weary of it all and wanted rest . It had wide front double doors . A square bell tower , that rose about as high as the roof ridge , was at the extreme right . Dunnigan noticed that the cross at the apex of the church roof was clean and painted , as was a small cross above the front doors . The crosses were white . The whole edifice had once been white . What was obviously the parish house  --  a two-story frame dwell- ing , with a narrow , railed veranda along its front  --  stood farther back on the lawn and at the opposite side of the bell tower . This parish house also needed painting and had a pathetic look of re- spectable poverty . Dunnigan noted with some surprise that the grass was well kept , green . and trimmed , and there were bright geraniums in the cir- cular flower bed between the church and the parish house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only touches of healthfulness . Crossing the roadway , and mounting the rotted and cracked wooden steps ( life seemed to him just such a stretch of rickety steps ) , the " last episode " of Olga 7'reskcivna 's career  --  the last " sequence " in their unique palship -- -passed ( like the motion picture that was a part of it ) before his mind . T lHE EPISODE had commenced more than a year after the dinner at Ming Cow 's , for the winter became spring , and another summer and winter intervened . What happened in between is quickly chronicled . The first week after that Christmas Eve was a battle for Dunnigan . He found himself thinking too often of Olga Treskovna . Every tele- graph office that he passed , every telegraph counter in the hotels cried out , " Send her a wire ! Tell her what she really means to you ! " Every shining telephone instrument in his hotel rooms beckoned an invitation to ask for " Long Distance " so that he could presently THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 43hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  --  like himself , she was changing cities every few days  --  but he knew in a general way the route of a burlesque company traveling west . He could have quickly located her , if he had tried . He had no urge to write . He never wrote letters . Had an almostphysical abhorrence of correspondence . He conducted his business entirely by telephone and wire . He had quit two good jobs because his bosses wanted letters , complained of his large telephoneaccounts and two-hundred-word telegrams . He simply could not be bothered writing to people  --  hunting for a place not out of postage stamps  --  when there was an easier and quicker means at hand . Nevertheless , he fought this desire to communicate with Olga Treskovna . He had made up his mind they were just good friends . Pals . Pals in his world did n't phone each other every week , every day . He might not hear from a pal for a whole year . Two years . That did n't mean they were any the less friendly . If only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his room at night . when he ate solitary dinners in the ornate hotel dining rooms ! He was glad when , several weeks later , he was " home " again near Times Square . Broadway was not quite so lonely . There was a letter from her one morning , sent care of the ZiegfeldTheater . He had told her he would be back in New York in about a month . He held the envelope in his hand and he knew that his heart was beating faster . He knew the letter was from Olga Treskovna because her name was written across the name of a San Francisco hotel printed in the corner of the envelope . He let his cigar completely burn out as he gazed at it . He did not open the letter there . He went back to his hotel . Alone , in his room , high above Broadway , he read it . It was just a letter of thanks for the Christmas Eve dinner  --  " You 're back in New York now , and I want to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember it always "  --  and the further news that she had given in her notice to leave the burlesque show in Los Angeles and make that " try for a quick road to fame " in the pictures . He read the letter over and over . He had never seen her handwritingbefore . It was a bold , legible , vertical script  --  strong and44 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSsincere . " Like her , " he thought . She knew what she wanted to do . And she had the guts to tackle it ! The temptation to put in a call across the continent was almost stronger than he could resist . He picked up his telephone receiver . But he crushed the temptation down . Instead of saying , " Long Distance , please , " he ordered a highball . When he went out again , he did stop at the telegraph stand in the lobby and sent her a wire . " Thanks , kid , " he wrote on the yellow paper . " Keep your chin up ! I 'll be watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote him again two weeks later , giving him the address of a hotel in Hollywood . She was at last at her geographical goal , " my Mecca , " as she said , and was going to start out the next day making the rounds of the picture studios . She sent him a poem she had written " about a girl and a star . " " I do n't mean that it 's me ! " she wrote , " for my eyes are blue , I believe . It 's just that I get homesickfor my hills . The hills that you do n't like , because they make your knees tired ! I like to imagine things that could happen to imaginary people back there . " Dunnigan read and reread the poem . He read it so many times that he learned it by heart , the only poem he ever committed to memory in his life . This was the poem : AUSTIABy Olga TreskovnaAustra  --  tall and strong and fine , Somehow like our mountain pine . Earthborn  --  but her dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Austra " meant " a morning star " - Star the Pine Tree loved afar . Each dawn Austra climbed the tor Where the Pine Tree loved the Star . Blue shone in her dark , green eyes  --  Blue and gold of morning skies . There she stood with Tree of Pine  --  Tall and strong and mountain-fine . THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 45Mountain skies are thrill-shot blue . Mountain storms are thrill-shot too . Thunder bellows at the torAs the Pine Tree seeks the Star .

Strangers say she 's sleeping there By her Pine Tree  --  broken  --  bare . Mountain folk have keener sight  --  Folk who rise with dawn star-light . Near the Morning Star they 've seen Anew satellite  --  dark green ! Dunnigan did not answer this second letter at all . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to day . He was afraid to answer it . He was afraid to involve himself further with Olga Treskovna . She stirred him too deeply . And he now felt he would only be in her way  --  if she also came to care . He knew nothing of " pictures . " Olga Treskovna would doubtlessmake friends in Hollywood who could really help her . He , hill Dunnigan , would just be a New York stumbling block to her progress  --  a Broadway millstone about her neck . He must kill off This love thing that somehow would not completely die in his heart . And Olga Treskovna did not write again . She was a little hurt that he did not acknowledge her verse . Was it as bad as that ! And as he afterwards knew  --  there was nothing of cheer to write him about . THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS10IN HIS BATTLE to forget Olga Treskovna . Dunnigan received some help at this time of an unexpected and tragic sort . The genius-producer of his yearly revue suddenly died . That ended the series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man , admired him greatly . They had been closely associatedfor ten years . He felt pretty bad . After awhile , when the old office was closed and its affairs wound up , when the famous New York theater was leased to pictures , he went to work for a rival management . And swiftly , in one season , five consecutive musical plays Dunnigan press-agented failed miserably . Three of them did not even get to New York , after expensive , money-losing tryouts . For years the white-spatted , derby-wearing press man had been considered good luck to any attraction . Bill ( White Spats ) Dunnigan " out ahead " meant a sure-fire hit . He began to worry . Could it be that fortune had turned thumbs down ? Was he  --  of all people  --  now becoming that shunned , abhorred pariah of the show world , a " jinx " ? He tried to laugh off the thought , but once he started thinking about it , it stuck in his mind . And he knew that his Broadway associates sensed his worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was he , at forty-one , on the toboggan ? Through ? It might he so . He knew only too well what a fickle jade the theater could be ! He knew too many guys who had been on top and were now borrowing quarters for lunch money . This was the year ( and we are now reaching the beginning of that final " episode " that concerned Olga Treskovna ) that one of the wonder personages of the motion-picture industry was skyrocketing to fame  --  in that amazing industry that sometimes made talented impresarios of humble pants pressers . Marcus J. Harris had left the company he ( and his deceased brother ) had founded , and of which his name was still a part , and THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 4formed his own Super Pictures , Inc. , Marcus J. Harris President . His first new independent production , " Gone with the Sunrise , " was a tremendous financial and artistic success . Harris , whose humble origin and lack of formal education had been the butt of numerous jokes at first , soon won approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and financial genius , with a sure instinct and taste for the best . Now he was about to launch a second epic venture on his own , a picturization of another best-selling novel , The Garden of the Soul . For it , he had engaged and was bringing to America for the first time , the noted Polish actress , Anna Gronka . She spoke English . Harris had seen her in two London-made films . The star role of the new story required a Slavic type . And Marcus Harris wanted a special publicity campaign for this great foreign star and for what he felt was the finest story he had ever produced . He was dissatisfied with what was being done by his regular staff . He was told there was one man who could do justice to Anna Gronka and " The Garden of the Soul . " The late revue producer 's ace press agent , Bill Dunnigan . This press man had made and handled sensationally a dozen great stars . He knew all the tricks and invented new ones . He might bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of Harris what he had done for the name of this musical show producer  --  and for half a dozen other Broadway figures . Marcus Harris in Hollywood sent a telegram to William Dunniganin New York . Marcus Harris received no answer . He sent a second wire , saying he would be in New York the next week , and requesting Dunnigan to appear at the Super Pictures , Inc. , offices in Radio City at elevenfifteenthe following Tuesday morning . Dunnigan , of course , received both telegrams . The Harris organizationdid not send wires to wrong addresses . What happened was that the Broadway press agent ignored them ! He simply was not interested , in spite of his worry about whether he was becoming a jinx . As Dunnigan had told Olga Treskovna and most of his friends , he disliked motion pictures . Jinx or no jinx , he would fight it out in his own " legitimate " field . But Marcus Harris got what he was after , whether it had been1$ THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSthe pants of all the male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his present business  --  a story , a star , a press agent . When Dunnigan did not appear at the august New York offices at the appointedtime , Harris telephoned the Dunnigan room at the hotel where the press agent lived . Dunnigan happened to be in . . " I want you , " said Marcus Harris , " to handle Anna Gronka and my next picture , The Garden of the Soul . ' You know I want you , and I know you are disengaged at the moment . So , that being the case , the only question is , do you start for me today or tomorrow ? " " Thanks , " said Dunnigan , and he could not but smile , " but I do not start at all . I do n't like Hollywood . I hate pictures . " " I do n't like Hollywood myself , " said the imperturbable Harris . " What is your salary ? " " More than you 'll pay , " Dunnigan retorted . But he could n't help admiring this calm voice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his late employer . " I ask you , what is your salary ? " Marcus Harris repeated quietly . " Three hundred a week , " Dunnigan fired back , raising it onehundred more than his real fee . That would end the conversation . " I 'll make it four hundred and you started work yesterday , " Marcus Harris said . Dunnigan laughed . " Do n't be a damn fool ! " he said to himself . To Marcus Harris he said , " You win , boss . I 'll be at your office in an hour . I start work then . " " I do n't think I 'll still be here in an hour . I have a Wall Street meeting with my bankers . But go to my publicity department . They 'll expect you . I 'll see you later in the day . And Dun-nigan " Yes , boss . " " I am sending a messenger with your first week 's salary and a hundred dollars expense money . Wait for it , please . " He hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also . Then he had a good laugh  --  at himself . He 'd always heard the picture business was screwy . It sure was ! Well , he was in it now . He 'd crossed the Rubicon or the Tiber or whatever the name of that river was ! His word was as good as his bond . Maybe it would change his luck . You just could n't turn down aTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS -l ' persistent guy like this Marcus Harris . He 'd give it a couple of summer months till the regular theater season started . Incidentally , he was on a spot . He was always on a spot because he had saved no money . That is , he had not saved any sum he consideredworthy to be called " money . " He lived well and gave freely . The expensive suits and shirts and neckties and shoes would have dented a larger salary . Ten to fifteen Regina Perfectos a day at forty cents each could be quite an item . He was known as an " easy touch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had a lucky afternoon at the race track , and deposited five hundred dollars in a branch of a Dime Savings Bank in a remote section of Brooklyn . " Deposited the money in a foreign country so it will be hard to go and get  --  it will pay for my funeral , " he explained to an intimate . " Do n't want them passing the hat when I croak . " Now he was clown to that five hundred , and quite healthy ! Only yesterday he had dug out the bankbook and put it in his wallet . He did not like the thought of journeying to darkest Brooklyn . The " hated " pictures were saving him that hardship ! IIMARCUS HARRIS had an immediate sample of the dynamic bill of goods he had bought in Bill ( White Spats ) Dunnigan . When the ace press agent reached Radio City , conscious of five hundred throbbing simoleons lining his impoverished wallet , he did not even ask for Mr. Harris . " I 'm Dunnigan , " he announced . " Where 's your publicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the facts about this Polish dame , " he told the gentleman in charge , " and what you 've done already . If you 've got a brief synopsis of your yarn  --  what is it ?  --  ' The Garden of the SomethingOr-Other '  --  thatwill help . " 50 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSThe office publicity head was a Harvard graduate . He had been engaged to give a supposedly desirable " literary flavor " to Harris releases . He stared in some amusement at William Dunnigan . " Madam Gronka , who is to be the star of ' The Garden of the Soul , ' arrives tomorrow at eleven from Europe . The French Line . We have covered it thoroughly . Sent out formal notices to every paper . " " O. K. , kiddo ! Give me half an hour to look at your stuff . I might still have a suggestion or two for covering it , " smiled back the cigar-puffing man in the plaid suit and the white spats , with his black derby now pushed to the rear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( who had also taken a postgraduate course cunt laude in " public relations " ) a hearty , comradely slap on the back . In exactly half an hour  --  from the cloud of the second Regina Perfecto going double blast  --  the hurricane started . Dunnigan got the Polish Embassy iii Washington by long distance . He persuaded the Ambassador himself to fly to New York next morning . It would ' put his country in the news  --  help cement friendly relations . ' ( Dunnigan sensed that the Ambassador had always had a secret yen to meet the great Gronka . ) Dunnigan next phoned City Hall and talked with his good pal , the Mayor . Certainly ! His Honor would be glad to welcome Gronka " officially " at noon , if Bill would bring her to City Hall from the boat . " You know , there 's a lot of Polacks in this town ! " said Bill . The Mayor knew it , and that they had votes . That gave Dunnigan another idea . He remembered seeing some of these " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their picturesque peasant costumes . He located the headquarters of their largest society . ' Could a hundred of them be at City Hall at twelve to welcome a famous countrywoman , meet their Ambassador , as guests of the Mayor ? And oh yes  --  could they wear the grand uniforms in which he 'd seen them marching on Memorial Day ? And could they bring their band ? Would n't it be nice to march up Broadway and to the Waldorf for a reception and luncheon in Madam Gronka 's honor ? ' The voice at the other end was gasping and eager with excitement . ' They certainly could ! ' Maybe the voice ' could get together two hundred ? Could the wives and children come ? ' THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 51 " Why not ! " said Bill Dunnigan . " But have all of ' em in those swell costumes . It will make Madam Gronka feel that she is among friends ! " Back to City Hall again , via the ever busy telephone wire , rushed the new Harris press agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detail of mounted police to lead it . " A few motorcycles and their sirens to clear traffic would also be appreciated . " And to his friend Oscar at the ' Waldorf : " Hold the grand ballroom and be ready to serve a luncheon to about five hundred . By the way  --  decorate your joint in whatever the colors of Poland are  --  you know  --  where the Polacks come from  --  and hang out a Polish flag or two over the Park Avenue entrance . Marcus Harris ' Super Pictures , Inc. , will foot the bill . " Oscar  --  smiling  --  knew what to do ! He had helped out Bill Dun- nigan on short notice before . Now to the newspapers  --  the city desks , the dramatic critics , the film critics ! The syndicates and the newsreels ! Telling each per- sonally what was cooking , and inviting all and sundry , in the name of Marcus Harris , to the Waldorf reception . To the ship news boys at the Battery  --  he 'd have a special tug to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The newsreel lads were also invited on this trip , and the staff photographers . A call now to his friend Fred Dalzell , who controlled the tugboat business in the har- bor . ' Sure ! Dunnigan could have his newest tug ! It was a Diesel- engined jim-dandy ! ' Meantime , the somewhat groggy Harris publicity staff was rush- ing page-long telegrams to the innocent editors of every large news- paper in the entire country . Telegrams announcing Gronka 's ar- rival for the new Marcus Harris film , describing the " momentous excitement " in New York over her arrival , the plans for her " official reception "  --  a glorified summary of the lady 's career abroad . Action ! That was exactly what Dunnigan needed to pull him out of his damn slump . He 'd show ' em if he was " through " ! Marcus Harris was n't able to meet his new publicity aid . He had to fly to the Coast the next morning without seeing him . By the time his new boss returned from Wall Street that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper offices , carrying under his arm photographs of Gronka and separately typed and slightly52 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSdiffering copies of her life history . Turning loose that infectious Irish smile on the hard-boiled among the editors . But Mr. Harris read the morning papers before he left . Lengthy news stories in every one of them . Front page in several . The Ambassador 's coming and the City Hall reception had turned the trick . The newspaper boys liked Dunnigan . He had " color . " They had all heard rumbles about the " jinx . " There was n't one of them but would stretch a point to put him in the running again . Before he left , Harris did talk with Dunnigan . Called him on the telephone from his home . " I 've got to leave at nine , " he said . " Just learned there is a chance of borrowing Victor George for our male lead , if I am on the ground . Can you see me off at the airport in three-quarters of an hour ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Due at the Battery in half an hour . " Harris was disappointed but pleased . He , too , liked action in a business world too often cluttered with big talk and no performance . " Well , good luck . I leave it in your hands . You seem to be doing all right with the morning papers . Congratulations ! Make my apologies to Madam Gronka for not meeting her . Bring her on to the Coast tomorrow if possible . The office will charter a plane . We 've got to start shooting at once . Everything 's ready there , if I can land this leading man . " " O. K. , boss , " said Bill . " See you in movieland tomorrow night ! " Astute Marcus Harris was still smiling when he boarded his plane . For his first-week 's investment of five hundred dollars he knew he had already received five thousand dollars ' worth of free space in the morning New York papers . Why had n't he discovered Dunnigan before ! And the day had only started ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Illustrated by two and three column group photographs of the star , the Ambassador , and the Mayor . Pictures , also , of the " welcoming parade , " which included some four hundred stalwart Polish-Americansin gala attire . For Gronka was driven up Broadway and Fifth Avenue behinduTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 53screaming , red-lighted police motorcycles , a band , a regiment of her fellow " Polacks . " She spoke " to America " on the city-owned radio from the Waldorf . That night she and the Polish Ambassadorwere the guest stars of a famous coast-to-coast weekly program . Citizens , who neither read newspapers nor listened to the radio , saw sky-writing airplanes scrawling a huge " WELCOME GRONKA " across the noonday heavens  --  a last thought of Bill 's early that morning . Dunnigan passed up no opportunities . The Harvard graduate of the Harris office moved about in a flustered daze . " Do n't mind me helping you a bit , kiddo , " said Bill .

" The next morning Madam Gronka , her two maids , and Bill ( White Spats ) Dunnigan were speeding at a hundred and fifty miles an hour in a special plane toward the West Coast film capital . And in Radio City the auditor of Super Pictures , Inc. , contemplated a charge of fifteen hundred and eighty dollars from the Waldorf , and nearly eight hundred dollars in Western Union due-bills . The bill for the sky-writing was not yet in . " I suppose Mr. Harris knows what he 's doing ! " he said in dubious alarm to Miss Feinberg , the secretary . " You poor stiff ! " replied that lady . " You could n't buy what Mr. Dunnigan 's landed in the papers alone the past two days for a hundredthousand dollars ! " Miss Feinberg was all-out for the new press agent , who was alreadycalling her his " petite passion flower . " One thing disturbed Dunnigan as he sank back in his comfortable plane seat and tried to rest . Gronka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older and not so fine of feature . But the resemblance brought back a loneliness that the theater press man had almost succeeded in killing . " Poor little kid ! " He wondered if she were still in Hollywood . What had happened to her ? He 'd look her up right away . She 'd laugh when she heard he was in pictures ! THE TRUE ARTIST  --  and in spite of his denials , Bill Dunnigan was that  --  finds joy in any creative work . Motion pictures won him over . They had almost won him over in New York , the two hectic days before he boarded the Coast plane . Established in a suite at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills , with a fancy office at the Super Pictures Studios , he was , to his surwithprise , entirely happy about his job . For the first time , Dunnigan had unlimited money to carry out his ideas . His press releases were sent , not only to newspapers in a single city or state , but to the press of the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world was the market for a good film . He found many old friends in Hollywood : writers , actors , business managers , who , like himself , had been in the " legitimate . " The Brown Derby was not quite as homelike as the Astor Bar , the steaks at Chasen 's did n't seem quite as thick as those at his favorite Gal- lagher 's , but like Mercutio 's wound , they would suffice . And there was no further need to worry about being a jinx . These million dollar pictures did not fail ! Some were better than others ; some played longer and to bigger receipts than others , but the thousands of motion-picture theaters ( although they sometimes gagged a bit ) gulped and digested them all . He had meant to look up Olga Treskovna at once , but he did not . Each day he found himself thinking of her and wondering where she was . She might not have remained in California . But he fought against taking the simple steps to find her . Instead , he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con- ference desks with authors , actors , directors , and Mr. Harris himself . Setting up with expert thoroughness his publicity campaign for " The Garden of the Soul . " The little picture tycoon , Marcus Harris , was " good copy " and interested Dunnigan even more than the actors . He was a new type to the press agent . Clever businessman and great artist all in one. 54OLGA TRESKOVNA wore a colorful peasant 's skirt and blouse , and yet seemed more regally beautiful than any woman Bill Dunnigan had ever seen . His heart literally stood still . The moment he looked at her he knew it was no use pretending any longer . She was n't his pal . She was the girl he loved . He would fight against that love no longer . He would tell her he loved her . His first impulse was to call out her name . " Olga kid ! Olga Treskovna ! " But he thought better of it . He stood aside and waited while the cameramen finished their test . And he repeated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they met . " Poor little kid ! " For although the " stand-in " for a great star like Anna Gronka was not a bad job , and doubtless paid adequately for board and room , it meant that Olga Treskovna merely posed in position for Anna Gronka while the lenses were being focused , or made costume tests , as she now was doing , to save the Great One 's strength underTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 55Dunnigan syndicated a story across the country , building up Harris as the " Napoleon of the Industry . " This clinched the faith of the film executive in his new press agent . Even the greatest of us have our weaknesses , and Harris had a weakness which he was later to regret  --  a weakness for Napoleon . Dunnigan came upon Olga Treskovna suddenly  --  through the lens of a camera ! The great , new picture was to be filmed in technicolor , and the Marcus Harris technicians were experimenting on one of the stages with Anna Gronka 's costumes . A girl engaged as her " stand-in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her . Dunnigan , that day devoting himself to what he called " getting the low-down on the camera angle " of his exploitationtask , asked if he could take a look . He found himself looking at Olga Treskovna. 56 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS the hot lights . It did not exactly give the holder of the job a chance to carry out the acting principles of Constantin Stanislaysky of the Moscow Art Theater ! It gave her no chance at all . This was certainly not " making good quickly . " It was , in fact , becoming a mere shadow of someone else , or , to change the meta phor , it was being shunted onto a siding while all the opportunity trains dashed by . Even if you played a " bit " role , you had a chance to act , and there was always the hope that your " bit " would escape the cutting-room floor and stand out in the finished picture , attracting the attention of a director or a producer . But a " stand-in " ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that . When the test was ended he moved down to her . He felt exu- berant , boyish , as he pushed his way through the crowd of tech- nicians and property men . Life was good once you were sure of something ! He must tell her he loved her here and now , this very moment , come what may ! It seemed incredible that he had spent a lifetime without her . He would make up for lost time . She turned and saw him coming . The moment she recognized him he saw her face light with that radiant smile he remembered so well from their Christmas Eve meeting a year and a half before . The smile that was like sudden sunshine . " Mr. Dunnigan ! " she cried . The cry was joyful , but he felt it was the cry of a drowning person at the sight of the lifeguard . Well , he was there . " Hello , kid ! I 'm mighty glad to see you again ! " He grasped her hand . " And I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pals . " " Hello  --  Bill . " She held tight to his hand . Bill 's was a large , strong hand . He stared at her , his mouth slightly agape . He had so many things to tell her , yet all the words were stuck in his throat . " I 'm glad you 're set in a good job here , " he said finally . For a moment weariness came into her blue eyes . Sunshine  --  then shadow ! " It is n't a very good job  --  Bill . " She spoke his name awkwardly , as though she were being presumptuous to address him with such familiarity . " It is n't what I dreamed of you finding me doing . I THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 57read the other day you were in Hollywood  --  I did n't want you to see me as a stand-in " Stop it , kid , " he said . " I'in down a few pegs myself . I work here .

But they were already being pushed around by scene clearers . The light men were shouting orders . He could n't tell her here ! And he suddenly realized he was still holding her hand . Holding to it for dear life . He let go , embarrassed . A young assistant director moved in and told Olga Treskovna to report to another set . " You extras keep off the stages till you 're wanted , " he said to Dunnigan . " You see , " laughed Bill , " I do n't mean a damn thing here either . He thinks I 'm an extra ' ! What about dinner tonight ? I 'll come for you if you 'll tell me where . " She smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner . I 've got a flat and a kitchenette . It 's time I did something for you .

Even if no one here seems to think I can act ! " She told him her address as she moved away . " It 's in the telephonebook also , " she said . " I thought all the studios would be wanting to reach me ! " She was gone . Dunnigan watched her walk toward the stage exit and it struck him that she was one of the few women he 'd ever seen who walked gracefully . Eleonora Duse walked that way . And the famous Folliesbeauty , Dolores . When she was entirely gone he stood alone , smiling dreamily to himself . The die was cast . Tonight , after their dinner , he would take her driving to Malibu . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day .

They settled down and still had careers . He had been welcomed to several such homes of former globe-trotting guys like himself . They had children . He would ask Olga Treskovna to be his wife . He would never be lonely again ! " Did n't I tell you to move on ! " It was the efficient assistant director . " Sorry , pal , " said Bill . He was on a mountain top ! On the top of the Empire State Building ! He sang a snatch of a Follies song he 'd always liked , " A pretty girl  --  is like a melody  --  that haunts you night and day  --  " " Here , buddy !

I saw him when I worked the New Amsterdam in New York . He 's nuts sometimes but he 's a great guy , and he 's out here for the Governor on this new film ! " Even this youthful assistant director had heard of " White Spats " Dunnigan . And like all assistant directors , he was ambitious to get ahead . What a terrible mistake ! " Mr. Dunnigan ! Mr. Dunnigan ! " he cried after Bill , and rushed off the set . But Dunnigan was out of sight . Halfway to his office  --  walking rapidly  --  almost running . His office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE BELLS 59BUT DUNNIGAN did not , on that night , tell Olga Treskovna that he loved her . Startling things happened this time to prevent it . The evening commenced propitiously . The girl 's one room , kitchenette-and-bath , furnished flat in a small Hollywood apartmentbuilding , seemed to Dunnigan a pretty good substitute for Paradise . Olga Treskovna had added much that was personal to its original cold furnishings . Her books lined the walls in low cases she had bought for a song at an auction room . And the pictures were hers  --  good reproductions of good paintings . Bill noticed they were mostly outdoor scenes and the streets of little towns . Hilltops and church spires . There was a picture of another genre showing the dark interior of a great cathedral , the altar a blaze of light at the far end of the centeraisle , and in the foreground a figure of Christ standing in a soft glow against the tall , Gothic columns . It was called " The Presence , " and there was a verse in small , fine script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and lo , I am with you always , even unto the end of the world . St. Matthew , xxviii , 2o . " " That picture always reminds me of our Christmas Eve dinner , " she told Bill Dunnigan . " Why ? " he had asked . " Sometime I will tell you , " she smiled , " when I know you better . " Bill thought , " I must never lose her again ! " She wore a simple , light blue house dress and her white apron had small blue figures . " A home ! " thought Bill , " a home with her ! " That would make life worth the living ! She made him sit in a chair by the window while she prepared and served him an Old-Fashioned. 6o THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSHer telephone rang . " It 's for you !

I 'm afraid it would n't help if I said , Give the kid a break . ' " " Well ? " said Dunnigan into the telephone . Could n't he be let alone on this of all evenings ! It was Marcus Harris himself who was put on the wire . " That you , Dunnigan ? Come to my office as quick as you can get here ! " " Why ? " countered Dunnigan . He had grown fond of Harris , but he was n't quite used to being given peremptory orders . He gasped , however , when he heard the news . Anna Gronka had quit ! Left the Studio flat ! The full details of the historic blow-up between Anna Gronka and Marcus Harris need not be a part of this history . Dunnigan did n't learn them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone . Marcus Harris , it seemed , had dared to open his mouth to make a slight suggestion concerning certain mannerisms Madam Gronka affected in playing the first scene to be filmed . This " common American businessman " whose energy and genius had merely found the story , the money , the writers , the actors and directors to produce " The Garden of the Soul " had had the effrontery to tell Anna Gronka  --  the first theater personage in all Europe  --  how to act ! Her righteous rage , starting with a dissertation on the crudeness of Americans in general , rose swiftly and culminatingly to a **28;1765;TOOLONG of Marcus Harris ' ancestry , features , mentality , and , finally , his religion . The break had been pretty final . The lady had stormed from the set and was flying back to New York in an hour , where an unsuspectingproducer had made her a lucrative stage offer . She wanted no more " Hollywood insults . " " I 'll come , " said Dunnigan . He hung up . He sighed bitterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was all about . " I 'm not surprised , " the girl said . " One of her Polish maids has " I hope you like it , " she said . " I ca n't make any other cocktail . And I do n't like shaking things in a tin container here . It would sound just like a hotel then . I 'm so tired of hotels . " He knew that he also was tired of hotels . Well , please God , he would n't have to live in one much longer ! She held up her own Old-Fashioned . " To you and me , and to Ming Cow , " she said . " I wonder if he ever thinks of us ? " T here was hope for him then ! The girl must care a little , if she treasured so vividly the memory of their first dinner together . What a clever woman can conjure from those tiny compartments in a wall , optimistically named " kitchenette , " is one of the marvels even of this age of efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This time it was an American home dinner . Bean soup with the fragrance of the open garden , fried chicken with plenty of milk gravy and steaming hot biscuits , corn on the cob , and baked sweet potatoes . Thick apple pie with cream and a big cup of coffee that Dunnigan called " just right " for dessert . Olga Treskovna knew how to cook . She had cooked for her father when she was eight years old , and now she confessed to Dunniganthat before she got the job in the Wilkes-Barre restaurant that finally landed her on Forty-Second Street , she had worked as a cook for a well-to-do family in the Pennsylvania city . Dunnigan insisted on helping her with the dishes after they finisheddinner . He had done this for his mother always . Only now it was not a patched-at-the-elbow sweater jacket that he took off when he rolled up his shirt sleeves , but a Fifth Avenue tailored coat . And the shirt sleeve , wire of the finest Sulka linen . And like his mother , Olga Treskovna insisted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vest and trousers . Had he not been in love with her before , that simple , maternal art would have won Bill Dunnigan 's lasting worship . " Gee , kid , " he said , when the dishes were finished , and he sank back in her Morris chair puffing at his Regina Perfecto , " Gee , kid , I never knew before what it was to be absolutely content ! " He almost decided to tell her then that he loved her . But no  --  he would presently propose that they drive to Malibu . It was a beautiful , clear , early-summer night . Her star would be shining down on the beach . Under her star he would speak his mind. 62 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSbeen talking to me . Anna Gronka is temperamental . She 's had rows with managers before and walked out . Left one that way in London in the middle of a picture . And she 's nursed a special grievance against Marcus Harris . " " What grievance ? " asked Dunnigan . " That he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ar- rived . She said the whole city turned out and the Polish Ambas- sador came on from Washington and the Mayor himself greeted her , and yet Harris did n't think her important enough for a personal welcome  --  sent an underling to her boat " The underling was me , " said Dunnigan , " and as for that ' whole city turning out ' and the Polish Ambassador and the Mayor He stopped . Dunnigan never boasted of his exploits . " She 's just a damn fool , " he said , and let it go at that . " But I 'll have to go and see Harris . Maybe I can patch things up between them . " " If you do n't , I suppose it means the end of my stand-in job , " said Olga Treskovna . " I should n't think selfishly of myself when you and Mr. Harris have all this trouble on your hands , but it did pay better than ' extra ' work . " " Look here , kid , " said Dunnigan , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about something else . I 'll have to run now , but let me come back Iater . Tonight , I mean . Wait here for me , will you , kid ? " His earnestness surprised her , but she agreed . " I 'll read , as I usually do , " she said . Did he detect loneliness in her voice ? Well , that should be remedied . Aloud he said , " You 're still buying books , I see . " " I 'm reading history now , " she said . " I 've got the idea that if I study people , real people who have lived , it will help me to act someday . " " You must write , also , " said Dunnigan . " I forgot to tell you . 1 liked your poem about the girl and the star . " " Now I will wait for you ! " she laughed . " I 'll be back as soon as I can . I have my car , " he said and was gone . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as he was to start , he looked up to see if he could locate her windows . She was standing in one of them , and she waved to him . Gronka and " The Garden of the Soul " did not seem important . He mustTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 63get through with Harris quickly and hurry back . Tomorrow would be time enough to face business problems . Tonight belonged to him and Olga Treskovna ! But the problem facing Marcus Harris was an urgent and a seriousone . Dunnigan found him with his staff  --  his casting director , his studio manager , the name-director he had especially engaged . They had been in conference an hour . What to do ? Half a million dollars in sets already had been constructed . Another half a million in actors , authors , composers , technicians , were under play-or-pay contract . Victor George , the leading man who was to play opposite Gronka , was on loan-out to Harris from United Stars only for the next six weeks . Harris had flown on from New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome bonus . Time was tragically of the essence . " The Gardenof the Soul " had to be shot speedily , or else the fortune and prestige of Marcus Harris , Dunnigan-dubbed " Napoleon of the Industry , " would wither and fade . " Want me to try to patch it up ? " said Dunnigan . He felt keenly sorry for this short , round-faced , thick-lipped , homely man , whom he had found generous and straight-dealing . " I probably know Gronka better than anyone . I do n't like her , but I know her . I 've patched up star and producer quarrels before . " " That is over , " said Marcus Harris quietly . " I would not let her inside my Studio . I do not mind what people think of me , if they make fun of how I look and dress and talk . Maybe I am ludicrous . If it amuses them , they can laugh because my brother and I had a small tailoring shop on East Seventieth Street and pressed pants . It was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of it when he brought us here as small boys from Russia . They can speak of me personally as they wish . I know all the jokes . But when anyone attacks me because I am a Jew , I am through . I am not ashamed that I am a Jew . I am proud of it . My father and no , mother were Jews . And their fathers and mothers before them . I can understand now what my father and mother went through before they came to this great country . That woman from over there has shown me . " Dunnigan had once managed a play about Sancho Panza . He thought of the courageous Sancho as he looked at Marcus Harris  --  Sancho the goatherd who became the Governor of a Province , ruled64 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSit wisely , and , because he had been a goatherd , had to endure the taunts of those who had not half his wisdom or were not half his equal . Marcus Harris , with his squat , ungainly body , his short fat legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he paced the floor of his domainand would risk disaster rather than crawl to an ignorant defamerof his ancient faith . " I 'll telephone the newspapers and the press associations at once , " said Dunnigan . " I 'll give them your side of the quarrel , Mr. Harris , before Gronka gets to them . " " When I phoned for you I thought of doing that , " said Marcus Harris , " but I 've changed my mind . After all , she 's a woman . We are gentlemen , I hope . Let her say what she pleases . We 'll find a way to carry on . If only we had more time ! " It was then that the idea came suddenly to Bill Dunnigan . It struck him so forcefully that he half rose from his chair and opened his mouth to speak , then caught himself . This was not the place to spring it . At least , not before the whole Harris staff . He must have Marcus Harris alone . " I  --  11 see the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the role did not suit her talents , " said Dunnigan , trying to speak matter-of-factly , to hide his excitement . " I think we should at least say that , and say it at once . Can I phone you later , Mr. Harris ? " " Call me at the Biltmore if you wish , " said Marcus Harris . " I 'm going to my hotel to think . Maybe I can think of some other star to play the part . I 've already tried Garbo and Dietrich , and half a dozen others . They 're all on assignments and not free for months ! It needs a foreigner . We 'll meet at nine here tomorrow . " Dunnigan seized his hat and went out quickly . He leaped into his car and started driving at top speed . But not to the newspaper offices . He raced back to Olga Treskovna 's flat , his mind pounding as fast as the engine of his car . He did not enter the self-service elevator . He tore up the stairway , two steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she opened the door he just stood there for a few moments panting , and held both her hands . They were inside now and he had caught his breath . THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 65 " Listen , kid ! " he said . " Do you think you could play Anna Gronka 's role in The Garden of the Soul ' ! " She stared at him . " Me  --  a great part like that ! " " Sure  --  you ! " said Dunnigan . " But I 'm not a star " Have you read the book ? " " I know it almost by heart . " " Could you play the girl  --  her name is Olga , is n't it ? " " I 'd give my soul to play it  --  but  --  " " But what ? " " This is crazy ! I know how they think . They would never risk all that money on an unknown like me .

And Harris has to shoot this picture fast . Right away . Or he 'll lose a fortune . " Olga Treskovna sank into a chair . Her eyes were wide with excitement . Her heart was pounding . But her brain was clear  --  that woman 's brain behind the face of a child , the brain that had gone through suffering and disappointment . " You mean to tell me you 're afraid to pivot now  --  after all this studying ! " And Dunnigan swept his arm in the direction of the book shelves . Olga Treskovna laughed . " Gee , Bill , " she said , " do you think I could do it ! " " You 're foreign looking . You 're Gronka 's height and size . The costumes all fit you . You 've had most of them on already . And if you 're not better looking and cleverer than that conceited , rattlebraineddame , I 'll eat the printed novel of The Garden of the Soul , ' cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's five hundred pages long ! I had to read the damn thing ! " " You did n't answer my question , Bill . Do you think I can act it ? " " Would I offer you the part if I did n't think so ? " " You 're offering me the role ? " " Do you want it ? " " Do I want it ! What do you think ? " " O. K. You 're in , kid . Sit tight . Go to bed . Go to sleep . Get66 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSa good rest because you 're going to have a busy morning tomorrow ! " He seized his derby and made for the door . " But wait a minute ! " she cried . He turned . " Does Marcus Harris know about this ? " " Not yet , " Dunnigan laughed . " But he 's going to hear plenty as quick as I can get back to him ! So long , kid ! Chin up ! " She heard him tearing down the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremendous plunge . He had not looked back and up , as he did before . She looked up at the night sky and there was her star , glowing like a rose near its group of little stars . Was it imagination that the star seemed twice as bright that evening ? Was it madness to dream that Bill Dunnigan could persuade Marcus Ilarris to give her a chance at such a tremendous part ? And that she could make good ! ARCUS HARRIS kept his real home in New York . As he had told Dunnigan in their first telephone conversation , he did not fancy Hollywood . But he had to work there , so he also maintained a suite the year round at the Biltmore in Los Angeles . A half hour later Dunnigan was in that suite . Harris was in pajamas and an elaborately-embroidered dressing gown . " My wife gave it to me Christmas , " he said apologetically . How Dunnigan really accomplished it he never could clearly remember . This was certain , few men could match him as a salesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to work on Marcus Harris with the deadly precision of a hawk attacking its prey . Why not give the stand-in , Olga Treskovna , Anna Gronka 's part ? This was the refrain , like the beat of a tom-tom , that Bill Dunnigan pounded against the ears of Marcus Harris . Harris listened . A secret of his success was that , at an early age , he had learned to listen . At last he said , " No . No . " THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 67Why not ? Dunnigan persisted . Olga Treskovna was Polish . In many ways resembled Anna Gronka . But she was younger  --  much more beautiful . She looked Slavic . She had the low , Slavic voice . She walked with Slavic erectness . " Have you ever seen her act ? " said Harris . " I have , " said Dunnigan . The press agent did not as a rule speak of his " past performances , " but he felt he must now tell Marcus Harris a couple of incidents that happened to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl in a cheap stock company in Syracuse one matinee when I had an hour to kill . I wired my boss , George C. Tyler , about her . Remember a little item  --  " and Dunnigan named a play and its new star that had created a veritable sensation some years before . " I dragged Florenz Ziegfeld to a vaudeville theater in Jersey City to see a guy that swung a rope and told gags . " The name the press agent then mentioned was not exactly an obscureone . " I do n't know . I do n't know , " said Marcus Harris . " I only know I have an awful headache . " " I tell you , this stand-in girl is a natural for the role , " reiterated Dunnigan . " What if she is unknown ? Did n't every soldier in the armies of Napoleon feel that there was a Marshal 's baton in his knapsack ? Was n't that one of the things that made the little emperorgreat ? He did n't have to let others find him leaders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Napoleonic reference did it . That , as we know , was the weakness of Marcus J. Harris . " All right , Dunnigan , " he said . " I 'll see what she can do . Bring her in at ten in the morning . I 'll have the director try her in the scene Gronka made hash of . And now , for God 's sake , let me get some sleep ! " " 0 . K. , boss ! She 'll be there ! " said Dunnigan . " And boss  --  she 'll make good ! " D UNNIGAN drove back to his studio office . He had there a shooting-script of " The Garden of the Soul . " He 'd been culling it for press material . He found the scene Marcus Harris wanted Olga Treskovna to play . He read it over carefully . Of course she could do it . It was tailor-made for her . He took a blue pencil and marked words in the margin opposite certain speeches . " Passion . " " Fear . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help he had seen Otis Skinner employ in studying a role . It indicated the mood of the spoken line . Then he removed the fasteners from the thick manuscript and extracted the latter part . It would not be needed . He bound up again the scene to be shot in the morning , and what preceded it . He placed this in a big manila envelope . Once more Dunnigan drove back to Olga Treskovna 's apartment building , this time through silent , empty streets . It was long past midnight . He took the trouble to stop his car gradually  --  no grind- ing of brakes . He got out and looked up . All windows were dark . The whole house was asleep , Olga Treskovna included . Bill Dunnigan had made his plan as he drove along . He must not disturb her again if she had retired . A few hours ' rest might mean success or failure . He entered the small vestibule . With his ever-present blue pen- cil , which he always carried in a vest pocket , he wrote her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was the usual line of brass-doored letter boxes . The name " Olga Treskovna " was on one of them . His manila envelope was too large to go into the small slot of the letter box , but there was a sort of shelf above , and he placed the envelope there , in an upright position . Dunnigan drove back to the Beverly Wilshire . It was three-thirty in the morning by the time he was in his room . He was dead tired but he left a call for five-thirty , and anotherTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 69for five-forty , to be sure he 'd be awakened . He took off his clothes and sat on the side of his bed . The motion-picture business was assuming new proportions in his mind . It consisted now of a great electric sign covering the top of a block-long building back on his beloved Times Square . That sign flashed in huge letters " OLGA TRESKOVNA in THE GARDENOF THE SOUL . " Bill Dunnigan went happily to sleep . At five thirty-five he was phoning Olga Treskovna . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sleepy answering voice . " Glad you 've had some rest , but now comes the dawn and get yourself wide awake . This is important . " " I 'm wide awake , Bill , " she said . " There 's a manuscript of the first part of ' The Garden of the Soul ' on the shelf above your letter box downstairs . Get it , and start studying the scene on page ten . I 've marked it . You 'll understand . You know the character  --  they have followed the novel closely . Get that scene into your head , for I 'm coming for you at nine . At ten o'clock Marcus Harris will shoot a test of you doing that scene . " " Bill , you 're not joking ? " Her voice broke a little . " I do n't joke at five thirty-five A.M. , " said Dunnigan grimly . " Il Harris and the director like the way you do that scene , you 're in , The director , Cecil Burleigh , is regular . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance , kid ! " " Oh , Bill ! " she gasped , and then there came a firmness in het tone . " Bill , I wo n't let you down ! " " I know you wo n't . Get that script , kid , and go to it . And do n't forget to make yourself some breakfast . You know what happened before , when you tried to pivot without eating ! " " I 'll eat , Bill , " she said . " So long , kid . Calling for you at nine . " Bill Dunnigan remembered he 'd forgotten to telephone the news papers about Gronka . He decided to wait . Maybe by noon the next day he would have a real story for the boys  --  a " stand-in girl ' promoted to a star ! He went back to bed , leaving another call fos eight. 70 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS HSE ffID CUP of coffee for him , bubbling in her electric percolator , when Dunnigan arrived at nine .

" I was too surprised last night to realize it , but it must have taken a lot of doing to persuade Marcus Harris to give me this chance . " " He 's in luck to have you on the lot , " Bill said , " and I 've had my breakfast at the hotel . You 've eaten ? Cross your heart ? Good . But I 'm grateful for this cup of coffee . " He drank it quickly . How different the gratitude of this girl from the absurd egoism of Anna Gronka ! Again he was on the point of speaking of his love . No . He must do nothing now to upset her . He looked at his watch . " Gosh -- we must hurry ! The make-up people are to have you ready by ten . " They did not talk as he drove rapidly to the Studio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could she , a burlesque singer , step into one of the greatest parts ever written into a novel ! But she looked at the man beside her , and knew she must not fail . His faith in her ability was so ardent ! He seemed to give her of his strength . If Olga Treskovna had analyzed her feelings for Bill Dunnigan she would not have called it love . It may be doubted if she dreamed that he loved her . And she would have considered it most presumptuousof herself to be in love with him . No , it was another emotion . She worshiped him . He was still her Wise Man from the West ; he was still the heaven-sent figure that had suddenly spoken up in a Forty-Second Street burlesque house , " Give the kid a break ! " She thanked God humbly that this great personage of the theater took an interest in her , believed in her ! THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 71Dunnigan had taken particular pains that morning . This day of days ! The black derby was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest . The white spats had never been worn before . The maroon and silver-striped tie came from under a shirt collar of purple-blue . Were you crossing a traffic light and looked at him at the wheel of his car , you might have surmised he was a successful racetrack tout , so little do clothes really proclaim the man . The crookedest gambler on Broadway dressed like a banker . To the girl beside Dunnigan , he wore the armor of a Crusader straight from Holy Communion . Or he might be a knight in shining silver and black , straight from King Arthur 's Court . Dunnigan purposely did not talk to her about the part . She was intelligent . Let her do it her own way  --  with such help , of course , as the Harris director would give her . He knew the bad results of " lecturing " a player just before that player " went on .

" Harris had thought all along that some of the Gronka costumes were too elaborate  --  that they would destroy sympathy for the character of the role . " Let 's go , " said the director . Dunnigan stood by Marcus Harris . Olga Treskovna stepped beforethe cameras . She looked at Dunnigan . " Go to it , kid ! " she could almost hear him say with his steady eyes . " Camera ! Action ! " The girl plunged into the scene  --  a solo in which she was talking alone . Dunnigan knew instantly she would make good . For Olga Treskovna turned on the pent-up emotions of a lifetime . The studying of parts in many plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lonely hotel rooms , the holding of hundreds of impatient burlesque audiences with sheer charm and sincerity  --  all these things and many more helped Olga Treskovna on that day . She had been asked to pivot and this time she was ready ! And72 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSthere was a burning determination not to let down the man who had won her this opportunity . Dunnigan , watching Marcus Harris and his director , could see that they were pleased  --  surprised . She was not perfect , of course . Harris made a suggestion . The girl grasped it instantly . The director suggested a change of gesture . Olga Treskovna was doing it before he had finished his sentence . They kept her before the cameras for two hours . They tried several close-ups . The great leading man came at eleven and went through a scene with her . Finally , Marcus Harris spoke to his director , and the director said , " Thank you , Miss Treskovna . That is all . We will let you know . " Dunnigan went to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'll take you home . Get some more sleep . They want to see how you look on film . The takes ' are already on the way to the laboratories . I 'll stick around . I 'll phone you . " " How do you think I was ? " she asked . " Apparently they 're never sure how people will photograph , " he said . " If we make that hurdle , there 's nothing to it . You can act , kid , you can act ! " Olga Treskovna went home in Dunnigan 's car . Bill went back to the Studio offices with Marcus Harris and the director . Harris had tried for still other known actresses with no success . It was a particularly busy time at all studios . Contract players were all occupied . The three men had lunch in the Studio canteen and at two o'clock Dunnigan followed Marcus Harris into the producer 's private projectionroom to see the " rushes "  --  the developed films just as they came from the sound stage . Dunnigan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was photogenic to a remarkable degree . She was more than just beautiful . She was heartrendingly appealing . She reached out and drew you into her scenes  --  into her heart . Her voice also recorded well . Rich , deep , thrilling , sincere . Dunnigan looked at the other two men . Was it his love for her that made him think Olga Treskovna was ten times better than Anna Gronka ? Had putting an apron over his head ( as his mother had done ) touched him so that it warped his cold judgment ? Or fried chicken and hot biscuits ? THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 73 " Dunnigan , I think we 've got something ! " said the director . His voice was a little unsteady . " Mr. Dunnigan found several new stars for Broadway , " said MarcusHarris . He was smiling for the first time in twenty-four hours . " When do we start on the picture again ? " asked the director . He was like a race horse at the barrier . " We start tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious day already . " To Dunnigan , " Who represents this girl ? What kind of deal does she want ? " " She 's on your pay roll already , " said the press agent . " I do n't know what you pay stand-ins , but that 's her salary now . I think she 'll leave the increase to you . " " All right , " said Marcus Harris . " We 'll see that she does n't go hungry . Tell her there 'll be a car and a chauffeur at her disposal . And a studio maid . We 'll have to work fast , and long hours . If she do n't fail me , I 'll do the right thing in the way of a bonus when we get it all on film . " Dunnigan knew that Marcus Harris would keep his word . The main thing was for Olga Treskovna to make good . Success in the star role of a film like " The Garden of the Soul , " and her future was secure ! " May I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , boss ? " said Dunnigan . " Shoot the works , " said Marcus Harris . " What was it you said about every soldier of Napoleon carrying a General in his knap-sack ? " " Carrying a , Marshal 's baton in his knapsack , " laughed Dunnigan , " Well , whatever it was they carried , get that prop into the story t , , the papers , " said lbfarcus 1-larris . " And Dunnigan " . ; Yes , boss . " " Do n't get the Polish Ambassador here this time . 1 think that fellow is hard luck for us ! " " Olga Treskovna is American , " said Bill . " Born in the great state of Pennsylvania . It was only her father and mother that came from Gronka 's Poland . " " I 'll riot hold that against Treskovna , " smiled Marcus Harris , " so long as it do n't make her object to my watching a scene occasionally ! Explain to her that I 've got quite a bit of money tied up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 74 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSAnd the little man pressed half a dozen cigars on Bill Dunnigan  --  a sure sign that he was happy . Dunnigan telephoned the newspapers . The story of an unknown " stand-in girl " getting the assignment opposite the great Victor George in " The Garden of the Soul " outweighed in interest anything they had heard about the Anna Gronka row . Cinderella stuff always went , as Dunnigan well knew . It gave every girl in America a new hope . He suddenly realized that he had not telephoned the good news to the person most interested  --  Olga Treskovna . She answered on the first ring . She could not sleep ! She 'd been sitting by her telephone . How could she do anything else ! " Kid , they liked your pivot ! " said Bill . He could hear her short gasp . Then , " Did it really turn out all right ? " " It turned out so well that you 're in ! " he cried . " You start on the real picture tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can hardly believe it ! I do n't know how to thank " Skip it , kid ! Did n't you save me from suicide one lonely night in Iowa ? We 're even now ! Get some rest and show up here at seven . The Studio will send a car for you . " " When will I see you , Bill ? " " You 'll see me plenty , but tonight I 've got to get busy myself ! Change all my press stuff . Put a new name into the releases . Bet you ca n't guess whose it is ! Chin up , kid ! Hit ' em hard ! " " I 'll do my best , " she said . When he had hung up , he realized that he had not yet told her of his love . What had happened to the drive to Malibu , to the decla ration to be given under her guiding star ! He 'd gone into the star-business for her himself now ! He musr give her every help in making good . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious time . THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 75THEY COMMENCED FILMING " The Garden of the Soul " at breakneck speed . Victor George , the star leading man , had to be returned to United Stars in six weeks . Olga Treskovnawas at the studio by six-thirty each morning . Her hair was dressed , her make-up applied , her costumes fitted . She worked beforethe cameras till five in the afternoon . Dunnigan haunted the stages the first week . He neglected his publicity work . Marcus Harris watched closely also . Dunnigan knew that even now it was not too late for the picture producer to change his mind . But the " rushes " that were daily run off in the private projection room carried only one message . Olga Treskovna was a ten-strike " find . " Twice Dunnigan took her to a quiet restaurant for dinner . But he knew she must have rest after long hours under the lights , and he drove her home immediately after and left her at her door . She had to study and commit the lines of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day 's shooting . He suggested she might prefer to live at a hotel while the picture was being made , to free herself entirely of house work . That did not appeal to her . " I 'm really just a home girl , " she said . " I 'll work better if I come back to a place of my own at night . I get rest and peace and strength . My studio maid is sending me a woman who will come at four in the afternoons , clean the apartment , have a simple dinner waiting for me . That is all I need . That -- and yout confidence in me . " She smiled her radiant , sad smile as she said the last sentence . Dunnigan 's heart was overflowing , but he said nothing of his love . The girl was giving her heart and soul to the work . Not entirely selfishly either . " I 'll die before I 'll let you down ! " she said to him . He remembered those words later . The theater-wise press agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE BELLShave no outside emotional disturbance . She was fond of him he knew  --  intensely grateful also  --  but suppose she did not " Iove " him as he loved her ? Suppose she would feel that she must now accept his love because of the great chance he had secured for her . No . Dunnigan wanted nothing like that . He would wait till the cameras stopped turning on " The Garden of the Soul . " Olga Treskovna would then , he felt certain , be an assured star . Her future secure . She would never have to worry again . She would not need him to help her . Then  --  then if she wanted his love ; that would be happiness for him and for her ! Meantime , work  --  hard work for both of them . Work can be a substitute for love , if that work is for the one we love . At the end of the first week of " shooting , " Marcus Harris flew back to New York for ten days . That meant he was fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being let out . And Dunnigan , conscious that his anxiety had caused him to neglecthis own duties , dug into his publicity campaign with a consumingvigor . He was careful not to say too much in praise of Olga Treskovna . He put emphasis on the story , " The Garden of the Soul . " He knew the danger of an extravagant advance ballyhoo for a new star . Let the critics find it out for themselves . Let the public acclaim her . That would make her a real star . Meantime , by making the name of her vehicle  --  the story  --  a household word , he would have the public in a receptive mood to grasp a new film personality . He began toiling at his Studio office from early morning till late at night . He did try each day to go at least once to whatever stage Olga Treskovna was working on . And he would have a few wordsith her . He felt that she understood . It was imperative that both she and the picture get off to a right start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruddier. healthier . And it was not until the end of the fourth week of shooting ( Marcus Harris had returned , stayed a week , and gone back to New York ) that it occurred to Dunnigan that the relentless grind was not affecting Olga Treskovna in the same fine way it did him . Watching her on the set late one afternoon , he suddenly realized that she was thinner , much thinner . Perhaps it was the heat  --  it was now July , and a wave of intense , humid weather had set in . He waited for her and asked that she go to dinner with him . THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 77 " No , " - she said , " you come home with me . I 'm too tired to go anywhere . I 'll telephone my ' cook ' to make enough for two . " " But that will be a lot of trouble . " " No trouble . Martha can go to the corner and get you some chops . We always have plenty of vegetables in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it was good to be alone with her . When the middle-aged Martha had stacked away the dishes and gone , Dunnigan put his worry into words . " Olga kid  --  do you feel well ? Are you working too hard ? Are n't you losing weight ? " " It 's the hot , damp weather , " she said . " Next week we 're going on location  --  up to Yuma , they say , for the desert scenes . I 'll be all right then ! We 're nearly through with the studio shots . " " I know they 're driving you , " he said , " but it ca n't be helped . They want Victor George back on the United Stars lot . A sequel story to one of his roles , and they ca n't start till he is through here . " " I 'll be all right , " said Olga Treskovna . " My star is very bright every night ! I look at it just before I go to bed . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl in your poem ! " exclaimed Bill , and he thought that he saw again a strange shadow move across her eyes . " I 'll tell you something to cheer you , " he added quickly . " Marcus Harris wired me yesterday that he 's buying another great story just for you ! " " I do n't know how I can ever show my gratitude to you , " said the girl . " But I 'm going to insist that Harris let you take a rest , before they start you on another one , " continued Dunnigan . " Maybe you 'll let me take you to Palm Springs . Maybe I can get a week off too . I 've been driving pretty hard myself , only I gain weight ! I eat like a horse out here ! My vests are all getting tight . I 'll be as fat as Marcus Harris if I do n't take care ! " He had lit his cigar , and was standing in front of the print called " The Presence . " Olga Treskovna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 'll tell you why that picture reminds me of our Christmas Eve dinner . In that restaurant I thought that you and Ming Gow were like two of the Wise Men  --  you know , in the Bible story  --  who met on Christmas Eve  --  and it seemed to me there was Someone Else there too  --  a Presence  --  like in my ' picture  --  and that78 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSHe would go to your revue with Ming Gow on the night you gave the passes for . " Dunnigan was moved . This was another time it was with difficultyhe kept from taking her in his arms  --  telling her of his love . When he had mastered his impulse he said : " If He was there , it was because of you ! I think you 're something very fine , kid , just about the finest thing this side of Heaven ! " And that was as near as he came to telling her that he loved her . " I wish Flo Ziegfeld could have heard you say a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover his urge to speak of more personal matters . " Ziggie produced ' girl shows ' but they were always inspiring , as well as sensuous . Like a clean flame ! Beauty was a sort of religion with him . That 's why he went on , year after year , and never failed with them . That 's why he will be remembered . That 's what all his imitators did not understand . And they lasted a season or two and dropped out of sight . " " I 'm glad ' The Garden of the Soul ' is a clean story and an inspiringone , " said the girl . " I suppose I would be playing in it no matterwhat kind of story it was , and grateful for the chance , but I 'm glad it 's what it is ! " " Things that are good always find each other , " said Dunnigan . " ' The Garden of the Soul ' just could not have been without you . " " Or you , " said Olga Treskovna . Driving back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could he ever measure up to her ? He could only try , if she consented to link her life with his. 19BUT THE NEXT DAY Bill Dunnigan was faced with as heartbreaking a decision as any man could have . Olga Treskovna had a coughing spell on the set , ruining a lengthy scene . The director called time out , and she retired to her portable dressing room . Dunnigan rushed over from his office when he heard the news . THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 79She opened the door of the dressing room herself , and came out smiling . " Hello , Bill , " she said . " I 've just ruined a scene . But I 'm all right now . " " Are you sure ? " said Dunnigan . She laughed . " Some of the big words I have to say must have stuck in my throat . These novelists surely like to use big words ! It 's silly of me to do a thing like that . Now I 'm going back to work . " The director , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press agent frowned . He felt a presentiment . She was n't foolinghim with her laughter and light dismissal of the coughing spell . He recalled there was something she once told him that tied in somehow with all this . He wracked his brain , but could n't solve the puzzle . The scene was re-shot , and Olga Treskovna played it with consummateskill . Bill watched awhile , but had to return to his office . He had an important appointment with a famous newspaper " specialwriter " who was visiting Hollywood . He had invited the man to dinner . But dinner over and rid of his guest , he had a keen sense of uneasiness . All at once he remembered . It was something she had said to him on that Christmas Eve , when she spoke of wanting to goto Hollywood . " There 's a reason why I want to make good quickly  --  as quickly as I can . There is n't time for the long years the stage usually takes . " He had not asked her to explain the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was in his hotel room . He lifted the receiver and called her number . The woman Martha answered . " Miss Treskovna has not been home . Telephoned me she would be late . " " Did she say where she was ? " " No , sir . But I expect her soon . " Dunnigan was disturbed . He knew that Olga Treskovna usually went directly home . He went out hurriedly and drove to her flat . The woman Martha was just leaving as he knocked at her door . Again he had ignored the elevator and rushed up the stairs two steps at a time . This time it was in alarm and fear . So TIE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS " I must go , " said Martha . " . It is nearly nine o'clock . I have my children to put to bed . " " I 'll wait awhile , if I may , " said Dunnigan . " I guess it 's all right , Mr. Dunnigan , " said the woman . " When Miss Treskovna comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She can heat it just a little , in case she has not eaten . " " I will tell her , " said the press agent . " And Martha , " he added , " give me your telephone number . In case  --  well , in case I need you . " " I have no telephone , " said the woman , " but I can give you a number in a candy store next door . They will come for me . My last name is Monahan . " Bill Dunnigan wrote it in his address book . He had never before been in Olga ' I'reskovna 's room alone . He looked about at her pictures and her books . He stood in front of the picture called " The Presence . " He repeated the first line of the poem she had sent him . " Austra  --  tall and strong and fine , Somehow like our mountain Pine --  " If only Olga Treskovna were as strong as she was fine ! What an imagination the child had ! And- then , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about her for some time . His eyes were drawn to several large films lying on her small writ- ing desk . He had asked for some new " stills " of her . Perhaps these were the stills . But why films , not prints ? He picked the films up . ' They were not " stills . " They were chest x-rays . There were the white lines of the ribs , the dark lung expanse . His heart sank . There was a letter in an envelope beside them . He could not help but see that a doctor 's name was on the top corner of the envelope . Dunnigan did not usually open and read other people 's letters , but he took this one from its envelope and spread it open . It was from a Dr. Hiram Jennings in Los Angeles . Dear Miss Treskovna , I have n't had any Iuck in reaching you . And you have n't phoned me as you promised . I have just received the accompanying x-rays from the laboratory ; and theyTHE MIRACLE OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your case requires immediate hospitalization . Please come to my office today without fail . I will be in this evening if you ca n't come during the day . Sincerely , Hiram Jennings , M. D.Dunnigan 's impulse was to telephone Dr. Jennings at once . But no . He had no right to telephone to Olga Treskovna 's physician . Not even to ask for her there . He had no right to take this letter from its envelope and read it . He read it again . Then he folded it carefully and replaced it in the envelope , and placed the envelope exactly where it had been when he picked it up . He put the x-ray films where they had been . He understood now why she wanted to make good quickly , and why she knew she did not have a lot of time . She had worked in the Breaker in Coaltown too long as a child . The monster had planted his black breath in her lungs . She knew her life would be cut short . She had seen it happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her any different . She was still the child of the Breaker . " The Breaker Girl . " Dunnigan was glad she had not come in . He hoped he would not meet her as he went out . He flicked off the lights and walked out of the flat . The catch-lock snapped in the door . He descended to the street , got into his car and drove back to his hotel. fie wanted time to think  --  to decide . He paced his room with clenched fists . EIe understood now why Olga Treskovna held herself aloof . Aloof and lovely . He understood why there was such a sadness in her eyes at times  --  those shadows that passed across her eyes . He understood why there had always seemed to him something sacred about her . She was a little nearer heaven than the rest of us , he thought . He could confront her with his knowledge , see this Dr. Hiram Jennings , rush her off to a hospital . What then of her career ? What of " The Garden of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would kill her just as surely if she had to give it up . It would ruin her . Chances such as she had barged into were few . She would never get another one. 82 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSThey were going to Yuma in two days . It was hot and dry there . Perhaps she could pull through . The picture finished , she could take a prolonged rest . They cured that sort of thing now . Come what may , Olga Treskovna 's life was her own . If she wanted to quit work on " The Garden of the Soul " and go to a hospital , she must make the decision herself . Even if she wanted to use her last strength to finish the picture , she had the right to do so . He hoped against hope  --  he must gamble  --  that she could finish it and still get well . He went down to the bar and drank two highballs . Then he telephonedher from a booth . This time she answered in her firm , low voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " After what happened this afternoon , I was worried . I had a business dinner engagement . But I tried to get you . I came out to the flat and waited awhile . Martha was there . " " I 'm quite all right , " she said . " I was a little worried myself and I went to see my doctor . He says I 'm fine . Just need a rest , that 's all  --  and I 'll get one now in another week . " " Palm Springs in another week ? " asked Dunnigan . " Palm Springs , " she said . He knew then she had made up her mind to stick it out . " Martha asked me to tell you your dinner is in the oven , " he added . " I found it and I ate , as you say , like a horse ! I 'm going to bed now for I am a little tired . " " Well , see you tomorrow , kid , " said Dunnigan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not go to bed . He went back into the bar again and stood alone in a corner and drank eight highballs in a row . But they left him cold sober . THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 8320OLGA TRESKOVNA put on a performance the next day that made even the stagehands applaud . It was an especiallydifficult scene and long , requiring almost ten minutes of uninterruptedacting before the camera . One wrong movement or inflection during those ten minutes meant that the whole would have to be retaken . She amazed the director by acting it perfectly the first time . He ordered the scene re-shot , merely for protection , and again a perfect performance by his new star . " She 's a marvel ! " he said to Dunnigan who stood back watching her . " Yes , " said Dunnigan . He alone knew just what a " marvel " she was . During the rest period the press agent went to her dressing room . " Kid , you were wonderful , " he said . " Are you sure you feel all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , " she said . He thought she was looking at him curiously . " I 'm for you , kid . We 're all for you , " he said . " But please take care of yourself . " He turned and went back to his office . It hurt him too much to watch her . He did not trust himself not to blurt out what he knew . That evening , Olga Treskovna and the company of " The Garden of the Soul " left Los Angeles by special train . They were headed for " location " in the desert country near Yuma , Arizona , to shoot sequences which were supposed to happen in the great Sahara . Dune nigan could not go along . Marcus Harris was returning to the West Coast the next day , and there were to be important conferences . The director telephoned the Studio daily , reporting on the prog Tess of the film . Dunnigan talked with him several times . The director 's enthusiasm for Olga Treskovna 's work grew with each day 's filming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found an artist so responsive to sugges-84 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS tions . The girl has brains as well as looks . It 's like playing on a Stradivarius after struggling with chain-store violins ! She will go far , Dunnigan , I prophesy ! " " How is she standing up under the work ? " Dunnigan asked . That was the important matter to him . " She 's grand ! Seems to be losing weight even , and that 's good ! We 're doing the part of the story where the girl is lost in the desert for a week  --  not supposed to get more buxom in the process ! Last year I did a picture and my heroine gained twenty pounds while 1 was shooting scenes where she was in a prison on bread and water ! It was hell ! But this Treskovna is an artist ! " The director also was an " artist , " his mind on his film story , not the health of such impersonal things as actors . " Do n't worry about Treskovna . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've lost some weight myself ! " he added as a reassuring note . Dunnigan was not reassured . He was worried  --  tragically worried . On Friday he again had premonitions of disaster . These were well founded , had he known . That day Olga Treskovna fainted during a scene , but she had quickly recovered and carried on . She would not give in . When she felt close to the breaking point , she set be- fore her eyes a tall figure , as she remembered it in an empty bur- lesque auditorium  --  a figure topped by a black derby at an angle . And she heard again a voice that said , " Give the kid a break ! " She had said to the director as she recovered from her fainting spell  --  a spell he attributed to the intense heat  --  " I must not let Mr. Dunnigan down ! " And she also , when she realized what she had said , found the same excuse , " He was a friend of my family . " By Friday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could stand the anxiety no longer . lint word carne that the whole cavalcade would return Sunday and Marcus Harris had called a conference Saturday afternoon . Dunnigan decided it was best not to run away . He sent Olga Treskovna a telegram . " Will meet your train Sun- day , kid . Chin up . It 's almost finished and in the can , as they say here . I 'm making reservations at Palm Springs . " Dunnigan had some photographers at the arrival of the train . He intended sending out a story about the " Garden of the Soul " desert scenes being the real thing , not studio stuff . He lined up the large company and working staff on the station platform , along the THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 8-side of the ten-car train . Olga Treskovna stood between Marcus Harris and the director . The girl was indeed noticeably thinner and seemed pale . Dunniganthanked heaven that in a few more days she could rest . For several studio re-takes was all that remained to be done . He drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both silent during the ride . He looked at her and her eyes were closed . She was very tired . He went up the elevator with her to carry her small handbag , but he would not stay . The woman Martha had only prepared food for one . He used that as an excuse to leave Olga Treskovna to herself and to her rest . " I still eat like a horse ! " he said . " I 'll go back to my hotel . Call me if you want anything . You need a good night 's sleep on your own bed . That always fixes one up . I know . See you tomorrow , kid . " " My star was over Yuma  --  it followed me there too , Bill , " she said , with a smile , as they parted . It seemed a forced smile to Bill Dunnigan . The sunshine was missing . There would perhaps be another day of it . Then she must rest for a month or two . So thought Dunnigan as he drove away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had friends there . She would have the care of specialists  --  get well and strong again . She seemed all right the next morning at the Studio . The retakeswere soon finished . By one o'clock they had a party on the set , and everyone concerned with the picture ate little sandwiches and drank coffee or liquor out of paper cups . Even Victor George , who was not the most gracious of male stars , had fallen under Olga Treskovna 's sway . " I propose a toast to the greatest little actress I have ever played opposite , and I have played with the best ! " That was quite an unbending for Victor George . The hundred-odd prop men , electricians , grip men , cameramen , wardrobe people , extras , actors , and actresses cheered . " Speech ! Speech ! " they cried . Olga Treskovna stood up . To all of them but one , she was the great new star of " The Garden of the Soul . " To Bill Dunnigan she was a shy , frightened girl standing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MIRACLE OF THE BELLS THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 87 " I do n't know how to make a speech , " she said . " I have to have my lines written for me . I can just say , thank you all from the bottom of my heart ! ' You have all been so very kind to me . And if you wish , I 'll recite you a little poem a friend of mine wrote about a girl in a small town where I came from . It 's a sad poem . But maybe you wo n't mind . This is a sad time for me  --  to leave you all . " This was the poem Olga Treskovna recited . Bill Dunnigan later found a copy of it among her papers . But he knew as she was sayingit that she had written it herself . It was like the other she had sent to him . " Things that could happen to imaginary people in her town . " Or was it imaginary ? She seemed to be saying the poem to him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day her father died . Sydra whom he loved the best Stood apart from all the rest . Smiled  --  and felt her yellow hair . He had loved his fingers there . Sydra wore no somber gownWhen they bore him through the town . She alone in dress of red . " Heartless ! " all the neighbors said . Sydra felt its crimson breastWhere his head had loved to rest . As the box sank under sodSydra spied some goldenrod . Laughed  --  and plucked its shimmering blade As the others shrieked and prayed . " What a minx ! " " She does not care ! " He called goldenrod God 's prayer . On the day they read the will ( Leaving her the farm  --  the mill ) Sydra was not even thereOn a straight-backed , parlor chair . Trout swam in the pool that day  --  He had loved to watch trout play . Sydra never climbed the hillWhere the grave lay , brown and still . Brought no wreaths , no flower-filled pots To outdo the neighbors ' plots . Then one dawn they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Dew had gathered on her hair . Many of the studio people came from little towns . With simple artistry Olga Treskovna had sketched a vivid scene that took them " home " again . There was silence  --  then applause . Bill Iunnigan thought again , " How fine she is ! " When the crowd thinned , he approached her . " Could we have dinner tonight ? " he said earnestly , for it was very important to him . She seemed to understand . " Yes , " she said . " I would like that . But at my flat . I 'm going there now to rest all afternoon . Martha will fix dinner . Please come about seven o'clock . I want to talk to you . " " I want to talk to you too , " said Bill . He thought , " 1 will tell her tonight . I must not wait any longer . " OLCA TRESKOVNA WENT HOME to her flat and collapsed on the floor . For two weeks she had been workingentirely on her nerve  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let Bill Dunnigan clown . " The woman Martha found her an hour later when she came to clean and prepare dinner . She was a calm , level-headed woman , and she got the girl onto her daybed couch and forced some whiskey between her pale lips . Then she called Dr. Hiram Jennings . Dr. Jennings rushed an ambulance to the apartment building and they took Olga Treskovna to the large hospital with which he was connected . After a quick examination , he told the nurse his patient had only a short time to live . He ordered a bloodTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLStransfusion . Dr. Jennings was provoked that the girl had ignored his advice about entering a hospital two weeks before . Olga Treskovna asked for just one thing  --  to see William Dunnigan , publicity executive at Super Pictures Studios . It took a while to find Dunnigan . He was not at his Studio office . He was nowhere on the " lot . " He was not at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel . Dunnigan had driven out to Malibu . The sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot on the beach where he would take Olga Treskovna that night , after their dinner together . The sky was clear . Her star would be shining . Then she should know  --  and he would know . He drove back to the Studio for a " still " photograph that he wished to show her . In it , the girl was standing at a convent doorway in her peasant dress , looking straight ahead ; and in her lovely , uplifted face was reflected the faith and hope of all mankind . So thought Dunnigan , and he planned to make posters in color of this " still "  --  three sheets  --  eight sheets  --  to look out from every billboard in every city where " The Garden of the Soul " was shown ! He would have it painted on the twenty-story sidewall space of that building on Times Square which was used for advertising . The girl who tried to imagine that her name was on a single Carnegie Flail billboard , standing there unknown and alone at midnight , would have not only her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theaters in America ! At the Studio they told him that Olga Treskovna was at a hospital and asking for him . He rushed out of the building , leaped into his car and drove recklessly past all traffic lights . Somehow he arrived without accident or being stopped by traffic police . It was about seven when he reached the hospital corridor down which at the far end was her private room . He forced himself to be calm . " Miss Olga Treskovna 's room , " he said to the nurse behind the floor desk . " What is your name ? " asked the nurse . " I 'm William Dunnigan . She sent for me . " " Yes . We were told to let you see her . Are you a relative ? " " A friend and business associate . " THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 89 " Has the patient any relatives ? " " I think not . Why ? " " Dr. Jennings left word you should notify any relatives . It is a very serious case . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunnigan . He somehow felt that this was very terribly the truth . Terribly and yet blessedly the truth . " You may go in . Room 618 . You must not remain too long . " Dunnigan knocked lightly on the door of 618 , his throat tight with anxiety . A nurse opened it . He took the few steps to the bedside of Olga Treskovna . She had the type of beauty that seemed still more lovely with paleness , and now , lying motionless in the hospital bed , she was as pale as any living woman could be . He looked down at her and drank in her unearthly , haunting loveliness which he would never be able to forget . She opened her eyes . A sad smile came to her lips . The shadow and the sunshine were there at the same time . Sunshine through a darkened cloud . " Hello , Bill , " she said almost inaudibly , " I 'm sorry I ca n't make good about the dinner . " He found his voice . " Gee , kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers . She took his hand and held it tightly , and he sat on the chair by the bed . " I sort of thought you were n't looking so strong since you got back from Yuma . But do n't worry . Chin up ! A good rest and you 'll be as fit as rain again . It 's going to be a great picture . You 're grand  --  better thanGronka ever could have been ! That studying sure was the right dope . " She shook her head . How fine her hair was ! The silken brown he had first noted when she bowed her head on the Forty-Second Street burlesque stage . And how wide apart her eyes  --  and how blue ! " No , Bill , " she said . " I 'm done for . I know it and I know that you knew . You saw the letter from Dr. Jennings and the x-rays the night you came to my apartment . " Dunnigan 's face turned red . " I saw the letter , kid . But thatdoes n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get well " Bill , thank you for not saying anything . For not telling thedirector or Mr. Harris . I just had to finish the picture . I was afraid that you would tell them . " 90 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS " That was your business , " said Dunnigan . " I had no right even  --  oh , just skip it , kid . We 've got to concentrate on pulling you out of this . " " Remember , Bill , " she said dreamily , " I told you I had to make good quickly . Well , it 's come faster than I thought . I wo n't live very long . I wo n't even live until tomorrow . " " No , no ! " Dunnigan said . " If these damn doctors told you that , they 're crazy . They do n't know half the time what they 're talking about ! I had a friend once " Nobody told me , " she said , " but 1 know that 's what they think . This time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought the nurse running to her side . Then she lay quite still for a while . Bill Dunnigan looked at the grave face of the nurse and understood . He was stunned . He wanted to fight on but he felt utterly helpless . She opened her eyes presently and spoke again . " I 'm not afraid to die . It 's my lungs , Bill . The Breaker dust . And I caught a bad cold just before we went to Yurna . I knew I should have stopped , but I did n't dare stop . I had to go on , had to get this picture clone . My first and my last . " " You 're going to make a lot more pictures , " Dunnigan said , but his heart had sunk . " And you 'll do plays too  --  in New York . You 're going to be O. K. Do n't worry about anything . Let me worry from now on . After a few weeks here I 'll take you to Arizona . I know a sanatorium there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll have a lot of fun . While you 're getting well you can write more poetry . I liked the one about the girl and her father . I knew you wrote it yourself . " " Thanks , Bill . But I 'll not he going to Arizona or New York -- or write any more poetry . I want to go back to Coaltown " " Sure , kid . I 'll take you to Coaltown too , if you wish . " " You 're the only one to take me where I must go . It 's not the town  --  it 's the cemetery  --  the lovely cemetery above the townamongmy hills . " " No , kid , no ! " " Please listen , Bill , there is n't much time . There 's five hundred dollars in my flat . It 's in a glass jar in the bookcase . Behind the Stanislaysky book . Please take it . I think it will pay for what I want you to do . You 'll do what I want , wo n't you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do what you want  --  anything , kid  --  only " I want the funeral from the church . St. Michael the Archangel is my church . The undertaker 's name is Orloff  --  James Orloff  --  write it down , Bill  --  he 's the only one there . I know , for I still owe him eighty dollars on pop 's funeral . Pay that first . I own the cemetery lot where pop is . It cost twenty-five dollars . I managed to pay for that when he died . But there 's no stone on pop 's grave . The priest can locate it though  --  they have a map . Stanislaus Trocki was pop 's name . That 's my real name  --  Trocki . Write that down too . I 'll spell it out . T-R-O-C-K-I . Sometime later maybe you 'll get a stone and put my name on it  --  and pop 's ? Make mine Olga Treskovna , though . " " Kid , " said Dunnigan , " you must n't talk like this ! " " I must , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to buy something for the church . I do n't know what . Something they need badly . They must need something that I can buy . I burned a candle once for pop and did n't put in the nickel for it . I had no money that day . It was All Souls ' Day , and I just had to burn one ! And I want the organ played  --  by the blind woman if she 's still there . And Bill  --  I want the bells rung  --  rung for me and pop . " " What do you mean  --  the bells ? " asked Dunnigan . " They always ring the bells of the church for a funeral , for ten or fifteen minutes , like they do every evening at six o'clock . But it costs five dollars . By the time I paid for pop 's grave plot and some other things , I had no money left to pay for the bells . Pop always loved the sound of bells . I felt terrible when I couldn " t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me you 'll have the bells rung for pop  --  and me . " " It 's a promise , " Dunnigan said . " I think that 's all , except I want some little girls with white paper wings  --  they wear them at Confirmation  --  to stand by my coffin during the Mass in church . I always wanted to do that for other people , but I never could . I could n't afford a white dress , or the wings . You 'll laugh at me for all these childish wishes . " " I 'm not laughing , " Dunnigan said , and blew his nose . " I did n't tell you before , " she continued , " but now I 'd better tell you , for you 'll find it out anyway . My father drank . He really was a grand man , but he got drunk  --  terribly drunk . He 'd stay drunk sometimes for a whole week . He 'd get fired from his job . And I'd92 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLShave to see the foreman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd let him kiss me and then he 'd take pop back . But that 's why we were always so poor . That 's why I had to earn what I could in the Breaker . Pop tried hard not to drink , but he could n't help himself . Pop should have been a singer , not a coal miner . I guess he did n't have the luck to know someone like you when he was young . Someone who 'd say , ' Give the kid a break . ' " She looked hard at Dunnigan . He was holding her hand so tightly it almost hurt . Again she smiled . Sadly  --  dreamily . " Do n't feel sad , Bill . It wo n't be bad at all sleeping there among my hills . Down in the town  --  no . I would n't like that . Where the other kids used to laugh at me because my legs were so skinny , and there were big holes in my shoes . One day a gang of them followed me all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your old man drunk today ! We saw your old man drunk today ! ' No , I would n't want to sleep in the town . But the cemetery  --  it 's way above the town . The hills are all around it . Guarding it . You 'll see . " I used to go there at night , even before pop died . I was safe there from everyone . Even the older people were afraid to go there at night . But there 's nothing to be afraid of . It 's beautiful , Bill , especially in the moonlight  --  just like a scene in fairyland , all misty and silvery . And the fireflies dance over the graves and the whippoorwillssing . I think I 'll like to hear the whippoorwills every night . " " Olga  --  Olga kid , " Dunnigan said , " I hope  --  I know you are allwrong ! " He stopped short . The look in her eyes stopped him . " You 'll attend to everything like I wish ? " she asked again . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave him that look of " You 're staying too long . " Olga Treskovna understood the nurse 's glance . " I wo n't talk any more , " she said . Dunnigan stood up . He bent down and kissed her white , thin hand . " So long , kid . I 'll be here to see you early tomorrow . " " I 'm depending on you , Bill , " she said . " I guess I 've always depended on you . " Her brave smile again . Then the shadow . THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 93Dunnigan walked out of the hospital . He left his address at the desk at the end of the corridor . " Call me , " he said , " if there is any change for the worse . " He drove back to his hotel . He went to the bar . He drank two double whiskies . Then it dawned on him that he still had not told Olga Treskovna that he loved her . He felt a desperate urgency to tell her before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital again that night ? He telephonedand asked for the desk on her floor . The hospital was just trying to reach him . The girl had had a relapse . She had asked for him again . For him and for a priest . He raced back to the hospital , cursing himself that he had ever left . " She must not die ! She must not die ! " he found himself repeating . But the moment he saw the face of the nurse who stood outside Olga Treskovna 's room , he knew he was too late . She had died five minutes before . A priest was in the hospital visiting another patient and had administered the last rites . No pain in her final minutes , the nurse thought . She had just closed her eyes and died . " She left this letter for you , " continued the nurse , and handed Dunnigan an envelope . He opened the unsealed letter . It was on hospital stationery , and the body of the letter was not Olga Treskovna 's writing , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took it down while the priest was here , " said the nurse . " She dictated it to me . It is witnessed by the priest , an intern , and myself . " Dunnigan read : This is my last will and testament . I have no relatives . I leave my possessions entirely to my dear friend , William Dunnigan . I want him to keep my books and a picture called " The Presence . " The other pictures , my clothes , he can give to Martha Monahan who takes care of my flat . Pay her the week 's wages that will be due tomorrow . Mr. Dunnigan is to take charge of ' my body which I want buried in my native Coaltown , Pennsylvania . He understandsfully all my wishes. 94 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS " What do I do now ? " asked Dunnigan . It was a sweltering night , but he was cold all over . He felt numb . " Come back in an hour , " said the nurse . " We have sent for Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will call an undertaker . Here are her keys . She had them under her pillow . I was to give them to you . " Dunnigan walked dazedly down the hospital corridor . He stepped into the big elevator and went to the ground floor . He got into his car and drove slowly to Olga Treskovna 's apartment house . He pulled up at the familiar curb . He did not immediatelyget out . He took out Olga Treskovna 's " will " and read it again . He stared straight ahead . It was a quiet street and deserted . Suddenly he dropped his head on his folded arms across the steering wheel . Bill ( White Spats ) Dunnigan of the dance halls , the prize ring , and the " girl shows , " sobbed as if his heart were breaking . It was the first time he had cried since he was a small child. 22 -  - -  HEN HE RECOVERED from this burst of grief , Bill Dunnigan became strangely calm . There was much to be done , and he was the one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that he had eaten nothing but one of the small picnic sandwiches since breakfast . He drove around into a near-by main thoroughfare and entered a small bakery restaurant . There was a public telephone sign on its window . That was another thing he wanted . He ordered a beef stew and then , consulting his notebook , dialed a number . He was calling up the woman Martha . He was glad he had that candy-store number through which he might find her  --  the number he had asked for the night he discovered that Olga Treskovnawas ill . He wanted Martha with him when he went to her apartment now . There were things he wanted a woman to do . THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 95He held the wire until her voice came at the other end . " Martha , " he said , " this is Mr. Dunnigan . Miss Treskovna has just died . At the hospital . I 'm eating dinner at a restaurant near her flat . I have to go there and I would like you with me . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour ? " The woman said she could and would . She was not surprised . She was the one other person who knew about Olga Treskovna 's health . Dunnigan forced himself to eat his beef stew . Then he drank three cups of coffee . He had no desire now for liquor . He wanted a clear brain . Olga Treskovna was dead . He was thinking about her with a detachment that surprised him . He would never see her again , except in her coffin , perhaps . He would never hear her low , vibrant voice . He would never watch that radiant smile break through the Slavic shadows of her face . She would never know that he loved her . He would never know if she loved him . He would never have that home , with her or anyone else . That last he was sure of . No one else would ever take her place in his life . It would be pretty lonely . But he would hear her voice , see her again ! The film " The Garden of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was , on some ten thousand feet of film , back in the Super Pictures laboratories . That must be his great work now  --  to make that picture a success  --  the greatest success any motion picture had ever achieved  --  a monument strong as granite to her talent , her beauty , her goodness . It struck him that on her deathbed she must have experienced a satisfaction denied to most of us . Most of us die knowing we have accomplished little or nothing . Nothing at least that will go on living . But this girl of humble beginnings was presently going to give to the world a great new joy and warmth ! And she knew it before she died . As little a thing as the " party " toast of Victor George must have given her an assurance that she had completed a good job . So , perhaps to her , death had not been so heartbreaking . She had done the thing she had wanted to do in life , and done it well . And he , Dunnigan , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , given her the " break " that had made it96 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSpossible . Thank God he had not ruined that work of hers by speaking the knowledge that might have prevented the finishing of the picture . Even if he were doomed to loneliness . Even if she was now dead . He paid his check and drove back to Olga Treskovna 's flat . Martha was waiting for him downstairs . The woman had good sense . She did not slobber grief . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Dunnigan , " she said , and let it go at that . Dunnigan was grateful . They went up to Olga Treskovna 's apartment . " I have her keys , " said Dunnigan , and unlocked the door . He threw on the light switch in the small vestibule . " Sit down , Martha , " he said , " I want to read you her will . ' It concerns you and me alone . " He took from his pocket the hospital envelope and read its brief contents aloud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a good girl , " she said , " and always considerate . I never worked for anyone so thoughtful and considerate . " " I had a talk with her this evening before she died , " said Dunnigan . " She told me there was five hundred dollars in a glass jar behind a certain book . It is to pay for her funeral . We will now try to find this money . " He located the Stanislaysky book , a thick , dark-covered volume . The jar was behind it and the money , in a neat roll , was inside . Dunnigan counted the money and placed it in his wallet . " I am taking her body back to Pennsylvania . I 'll leave tomorrow if I can . I have a good deal to do and must ask you to attend to things here . I do n't want any strangers in the flat . " " Just tell me what you wish done , Mr. Dunnigan . " " I believe the books and the pictures and her clothes are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment . Get some carton boxes tomorrow . You can probably find some at the grocery stores near by . Pack all the books in them , and have an expressman bring them to me at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills . And that picture called " Ile Presence . ' I will tell the hotel to expect them . Her papers and letters I will collect and take with me tonight . The other pictures are yours . I hope you will treasure them . They are good pictures . " " It 's mighty proud of them I 'll be ! And my children will enjoyTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 97looking at them . I 'll hang them in my parlor . I have three rooms . " " Now her clothes . Can any of your children wear them ? I would n't want them sold , or given away to strangers . " " My oldest girl is in high school . They will fit her , I know . " " Good . Let 's look at her clothes now , if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain dress . A blue house dress . She wore it the first time I saw her here , before she found you . She cooked a dinner for me herself . " " I know the dress you mean . " And the woman opened the door of the clothes closet in the vestibule . There hung Olga Treskovna 's wardrobe . There were not many clothes . A dozen dresses . Several simple coats . Dunnigan recognized the grey cloth coat with a fur-trimmed collar , the one she had worn that Christmas Eve in Iowa . It made him feel very sad . A few hats were on the shelf above , and in shoe holders fastened to the inside of the door were half a dozen pairs of shoes with their trees . " I 'll want you to go back to the hospital with me . We will take the blue dress . And maybe you will pick out the under-things that go with it . I suppose they 're in the bureau drawers over there . " " I will know what to take , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also fresh stockings and a pair of black shoes . " " We 'll stop and see the house manager as we leave . I 'll tell him you are in charge , and pay him if there 's any rent due . But I do n't think there is . The month has another week to run , and she probably took the place by the month and paid in advance . " .. She paid in advance . I took the money down for her this month . " " Good . Make a bundle of what we want and we 'll go . Come back in the morning and attend to the rest . She owes you for this week . How much does she owe you ? " " It 's twelve dollars , but I 'd rather not take it . With all these beautiful things she is giving me " I want you to take it , " said Dunnigan and pulled a roll of bills from his pocket . " Here it is . And here is twenty dollars to pay for boxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out money for . Whatever is left , please keep . " 98 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS " Thank you , Mr. Dunnigan . You can depend on me . While the woman was collecting the things for the hospital , Dunnigan took the papers from the small desk . They were mostly receipted bills for rent , groceries , milk , a hairdresser . The large x-ray films were still there , and a large envelope in which they came . Dunnigan put the films and all the papers in this envelope . There were several sheets of paper in her handwriting that seemed to be poetry . Lines were altered or crossed out here and there . " Poor little kid ! " said Dunnigan . He put the poetry with the other papers . Just before they left he stood in front of the picture called " The Presence . " It was not a large picture  --  only about two feet square in its frame . He had not really read the small script in the lower corner of the white margin . He read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always , even unto the end of the world . " Bill Dunnigan was not religious . He had never given any thought to such things as immortality or what happened to us in the Great Beyond . And it was then for the first time that Olga Treskovna seemed to be beside him . She was holding his hand . She was saying the words that were written there on the picture she wanted him to have . " I am with you always , even unto the end of the world . " A wave of content swept over Bill Dunnigan . He was not alone any more . " Kid , I 'm still working for you ! " he said aloud . " We'l ! put it over with a bang ! " " What did you say , Mr. Dunnigan ? " called the woman Martha from the bedroom alcove . " Nothing , " said Dunnigan . " But I think I 'll take this picture with me tonight . " He lifted it from the nail holder that supported it by a short wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and put it around the picture . Then he and the woman Martha left the lonely apartment . THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 99Dunnigan spent the rest of the evening arranging about tke body of Olga Treskovna . Although the tasks were tragic , his heart was not heavy . They were together now and would be together always . The hospital had sent for an undertaker . The body was already gone when Dunnigan and Martha returned there . He paid the hospital bill . He went with Martha to the undertaking establishment . Martha disappeared with the woman attendant to dress Olga Treskovna . She carried the blue dress Dunnigan wished the girl buried in . Dunnigan selected a simple coffin from the showroom . He filled in and signed the papers necessary to take the body out of the state . He paid the bill from Olga Treskovna 's cash in the glass jar . He had used up his own cash money , although he still had an uncashed salary check in his wallet . He realized he was very tired . He went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a week off to take Olga Treskovna back to Coaltown . Then he suddenly remembered that he had not telephoned the one man besides himself to whom Olga Treskovna 's death might be important . Marcus Harris . Well , he needed sleep . He would telephone early in the morning to the Biltmore . No use upsetting Marcus Harris tonight . And by morning he would have a plan for handling the publicity . Much would have to be changed . He must work out in his mind the best way of breaking the story in the newspapers of Olga Treskovna 's death . DUNNIGAN WAS AWAKE at seven o'clock the next morning . As he opened his eyes he felt unreal , as though he were some person other than the Bill Dunnigan who was press agent for " The Garden of the Soul . " What was wrong ? Then it swept over him like a flood . Olga Treskovna was dead . It was like a knife to his heart . Why was he still alive , now she was gone ? Than , t ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE BELLSshe was really not dead . She was not dead because every expression of her lovely face , every grace of her slender body , every tone of her voice was recorded in a picture story that would live  --  a story that he , Bill Dunnigan , was left behind to help make live . And she was not dead because he had felt her standing by him in her flat , when he had read the lines printed on the margin of that framed gravure . He got up , went through the customary setting-up exercises a very great fighter had taught him , took a shower , shaved and dressed . All the time his brain was working . He would tell the truth to the newspapers . That would be th illing enough ! Olga Treskovna had given her life to make that motion picture . She had been like a soldier going out to battle  --  a soldier who did not falter , although he knew that quick death awaited him . But in that death  --  victory . " I 'll put it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my smoke ! 1 ' 11 put it over ! " That was how he would explain it to Marcus Harris and he must telephone Mr. Harris at once . Perhaps Harris had already heard the news . Dunnigan first ordered his breakfast sent to his room . Orange juice , toast , bacon and eggs . And a pot of coffee . He must stoke up for a busy day . Then he asked for the Biltmore and to Lr connected with Marcus I-Iarris . " Mr. Harris , this is Bill Dunnigan . " " Yes , Dunnigan . What gets you up so early ? " Harris then did not know . Dunnigan knew Harris was an early riser and might have seen something in the newspapers , if the news had already leaked out . Apparently it had not . So far , so good . " I have some unpleasant news for you , Mr. Harris . Are you prepared for it ? " " In this business I 'm always prepared for it . " And Dunnigancould see the little man 's wry smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have waited till I saw you at the Studio , but you knowNapoleon said , ' Wake me to tell me bad news  --  the good can wait . ' " " That is the proper way , " said Marcus Harris . " Olga Treskovna died in a hospital last night . " THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 101There was a silence at the other end . An ominous silence , Dun- nigan thought . Why did n't the man say something ? The silence held and Dunnigan had to continue . " I believe I know how to handle matters so that it will even help , not hurt , the picture , " he said . " You are telling me this girl is dead ? " Harris had spoken at last , as if he had not been able to believe what he had heard . There was a strange tone in his voice . " She is dead . I was at the hospital . " " At what time did she die ? " " It was about nine o'clock . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a bitter shock to me . I was her best friend . I did not feel like talking about it . I had to attend to her affairs . Make arrangements at an undertaker 's . But I will come now to the Biltmore if you wish . It may sound cold-blooded , but Miss Tres- kovna would understand  --  we can help the release of the picture with a proper build-up about her death and Marcus Harris cut in . " At what hospital did she die ? " " The Cedars of Lebanon . Her doctor was a Dr. Jennings . I will be right over " No . Meet me at the Studio at nine . I prefer to see you there . " " Yes , sir . " " I should have been told about this last night . " There was a sharp click . Marcus Harris had hung up . He had not even said " Good-by . " Dunnigan had a premonition of trouble . It had not occurred to him that Harris would be angry because he was not notified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he might well have been ? Dunnigan was so disturbed that he did not eat his breakfast when it arrived , as it did at that moment . He drank the pot of coffee and paced the floor smoking a cigar . He took the picture of " The Presence " out of the newspaper and set it on his bureau , but it seemed cold and dead . He put it away in the top bureau drawer . Whatever trouble there might be with Marcus Harris , he would face it alone . He put on his hat and went down to the lobby and bought the morning papers . There was nothing in them of Olga Treskovna's102 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS IO ' as if he were regarding a crazy man . " You surely do not mean what you are saying ! " he exclaimed . " I mean every word of it , " said Marcus Harris . " But you can not do such a thing ! " Dunnigan cried . He was almostinarticulate . It was as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not do ? " Marcus Harris spoke quietly , in contrast to Dunnigan 's agitation . " It 's not fair ! It 's not right ! And you 'll lose a fortune ! " Dunniganheard his own voice rise almost to a shout . " I was under the impression that it is my picture and my money . " " Of course , but " " It will just about ruin me . All the profits of my other successes are in it . And more . As you say , I will lose a fortune . I will have to start again . Do n't tell me , Dunnigan , what is right and fair . " " I mean it 's not fair to this girl ! She gave her life to finish this picture ! You sha n't rob her of her work ! You 've got to finish and release ' The Garden of the Soul ' ! I know how to handle the matter " He was standing over Marcus Harris . He was crying out the words like a man possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcus Harris . " You are no longer handling the matter , ' as you put it . I am running my own business from now on , and I 'm not running it to promote any actress or actor . Particularly this girl . She was evidently sick when I hired her . When you persuaded me to hire her , " he corrected . " I must have been insane not to have investigated her . " " Investigated ? " Dunnigan was again on his feet . What could that mean ? " Since you so kindly telephoned me this morning I have checked with her doctor through the hospital where she died . She put one over on me . I do n't know if you knew . I give you the benefit of the doubt that you did not , and that she put one over on you also . She had advanced tuberculosis --  " " I knew , " said Dunnigan . " You knew ! You persuaded me to spend half a million dollars to back an actress on the road to an undertaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris was raised , and there was amazed anger in it . " What difference does all this make ? " cried Dunnigan . " Shedeath . In fact , there was a press story on the theater page , which he had telephoned around the afternoon before , about the " party " on the set and the shooting of the final scenes of " The Garden of the Soul . " They spoke of Olga Treskovna as if she were alive . One paper even used one of her photographs . Dunnigan walked to the hotel garage , ordered his car , and drove slowly to the Super Pictures Studios . He had known really big men to be upset by small things . He did not mean Olga Treskovna'sdeath . He meant the fact that he had not communicated with Marcus Harris immediately the night before . Perhaps he had been wrong in not doing that . Marcus Harris had a great deal at stake . He would apologize to him . He was asked to wait in the outer office of the picture producer 's room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He waited ten minutes  --  fifteen minutes  --  past the time of his appointment . He smoked half of one cigar , then lit another . Several other studio executives had gone in and out of the sanctum , and Dunnigan thought they regarded him curiously . At last the buzzer rang  --  the reception girl picked up the intercommunicationphone . " You may go in now , Mr. Dunnigan , " she said . Dunnigan entered the private office of Marcus Harris . The pudgy man sat at his desk . Dunnigan thought he looked pale and older . Harris did not rise from his desk as he usually did . There was no smile or gesture or word of friendly greeting . " Sit down , Dunnigan , " he said . Dunnigan sat in a chair opposite the desk . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Harris , that I did not telephone you last night . I was very upset . I apologize . " Then came the bombshell . " I did not ask you to come here to discuss that , although it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any unusual happening . It makes no difference now . The only matter of interestis that the star player of ' The Garden of the Soul ' is dead , and I can not release the picture . I shall not even cut it . I have ordered all work on it stopped . I have canceled all booking contractswith theaters . " Dunnigan was stunned . He could not believe his ears ! He rose unsteadily from his chair . He stood and looked at Marcus Harris104 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSgave a great performance . You admitted that . Your director admittedit . Even your leading man ! I have seen all the rushes and so have you . I 'm no picture expert , but I do n't believe there has been a finer performance recorded on any film ! " " I am not in a mood for discussion or argument , Dunnigan , " Marcus Harris broke in . His voice was coldly calm again . He regardedfor a moment the evident distress of the man who stood opposite his desk . " I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harris continued , " and I 'll tell you something , although there is no reason why 1 should tell you . This same thing happened to me once before . My brother Irving was alive then . It was one of our first big pictures . The star died . He released the picture . It failed . That season everything else went wrong for us . The banks would not renew our loans . A theater that we owned burned down . Some people who were injured started legal actions . Our financial troubles killed my brother . He committed suicide . He was alone . I had my faithful wife and somehow kept on . But I am not going to make the same mistake again . " Dunnigan afterwards said he felt horribly weak . You can not combat a stone wall ! Marcus Harris had spoken with the same finality as when he had refused to have anything more to do with Anna Gronka . The press agent groped for his chair and sank down , staring at Marcus Harris . He had read once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from under him and the man remained fully conscious . Thought he was still charging forward . That was how Dunnigan felt . " The public does not want to see a picture with a star who has died , " continued the voice of Marcus Harris , and Dunnigan realizedthis idea had become an obsession with the picture producer . " Maybe  --  after a year or so  --  I will film ' The Garden of the Soul ' again . I 'll find a star who wo n't kick out or drop dead while I am doing it ! I 'll find a press agent who wo n't put something over on me  --  sell me a bill of damaged goods " What do you mean by that ? " said Dunnigan . He was on his feet again and flushed . " You have told me you knew she was ill . " " I knew it only two weeks ago , " said Dunnigan . THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 105 " Well  --  that does n't make it quite so bad . I apologize for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point . You and I are parting company , Dunnigan . I was warned about you back in New York when I bullheadedly hired you , that you were bad luck to any show . That you were a jinx . I did n't listen because I was greedy for fame . That is , my wife is greedy for me to have fame , and I love my wife . And I knew how you had made the names of several Broadway producers famous . I thought you would do the same for me . I always admired Napoleon . You happened to use that idea . I fell for it . It pleased my childish vanity . Maybe it serves me right that I have got a kick in the pants ! Maybe I was getting too big for my pants ! " But I ca n't take on your bad luck  --  your jinx  --  any longer . First the Gronka row ! Then Treskovna dies ! What next ? " If there is any money owed you , the treasurer will pay it . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary , take it . I 'll gladly pay you a full month 's salary . I brought you on from New York  --  I will give orders to pay your fare back there . I 'm leavingfor there myself tomorrow , to beg the banks not to put me in jail . Not because of little money , but big money . " That 's all , Dunnigan . I 'm sorry , but I really do n't want to see you again . " Bill Dunnigan stood there feeling completely crushed . It was the word " jinx " that had crushed him . He felt it was true ! Marcus Harris was right . Whatever he , Dunnigan , now touched , withered and died . Olga Treskovna whom he loved , Anna Gronka whom he despised , Marcus Harris whom he respected  --  they all got it in the neck the minute he , " Jinx Dunnigan , " came actively into their lives ! He pulled himself together . " You can keep your two weeks ' salary or your month 's salary , Mr. Ilarris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anger . " You owe me nothing , not even railroad fare to New York . If I had it , I 'd return all the ' little money ' you 've paid me . I 'd give you back the ' big money ' you 've lost because of Miss Treskovna . " He turned and walked out of the studio offices of Super Pictures , inc . He did not get into his car . " Have it taken to the garage , " he told the guard . " I do n't need it any more . " Dunnigan walked to the street and hailed a taxi . He went first to his hotel . At the desk he cashed his previousio6 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS week 's salary check which he had been carrying in his pocket . He asked them to make up his bill , and arranged for the boxes con- taining Olga Treskovna 's books to be received and stored until he sent for them . He consulted the porter at the time-table rack and found that a train going East and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He figured out when he would arrive at Wilkes-Barre and wrote a wire to the undertaker Orloff at Coaltown . He found there was no telegraph office there , but telegrams were sent by mes- senger or telephoned from a place called Nanticoke . He had writ- ten Orloff 's name in his address book , and he jotted down the new name " Nanticoke . " He called up the Los Angeles undertaker and asked to have the body of Olga Treskovna at the station in time for this train . He would be there half an hour early to get the necessary tickets and attend to the checking of the coffin . Up in his room he quickly packed his large wardrobe trunk . In years it had never been entirely unpacked . ' That , he would have the porter ship directly to New York . It had been so shipped to Hollywood , for no plane would carry such a large trunk . He put what he would need for the next week in a suitcase . There was a box of fifty Regina Perfectos still unopened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suitcase . He sent for a porter and had his baggage taken downstairs . In the lobby again , he entered the bar for a last drink in Cali- fornia . He reflected , as he sipped it , that he should never have come to Hollywood . Pictures were not for him . No  --  if he had n't come , Olga Treskovna might have died as just a " stand-in . " At least the poor kid had had her fling . Six weeks of happy achieve- ment ! And she 'd died believing her work would live . Perhaps death was the end anyway . A long sleep into oblivion . So that it did not matter now to her what happened back here . Dunnigan hoped so . God , what a rotten , disgusting world to be stuck in ! He finished his drink . He intended to carry out Olga Treskovna 's dying wishes to the letter . He took a taxi to the railway station and was just a little alarmed when he found that after buying the two tickets required by rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had only some three hundred and fifty dollars left in the wallet . They were coach THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 107 tickets at that . He decided he 'd best forgo the luxury of a sleepingcar . He had no idea what the funeral expenses at the Pennsylvania end would be . His money and hers had disappeared like water  --  two hundred and fifty dollars to the Los Angeles undertaker , the hospital bill , the railroad tickets , his own sizable hotel bill . He had , of course , the Brooklyn Dime Savings bankbook . It had lain in a drawer in his trunk and he had transferred it to his wallet when packing . Well  --  he could eat for a week or two when he finally reached New York . He bought a couple of early edition afternoon papers . There was a brief announcement , evidently sent out by the Harris organization . " Olga Treskovna , player of a Ieading role in The Garden of the Soul ' has died suddenly . Marcus Harris will shelve the picture . " One paper mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden of the Soul " and recalled the Gronka incident . As for Olga Treskovna , she was not yet well enough known for the papers to play up her death on a bare announcement . Dunnigan could have handled it , but now . Poor little kid ! At noon Bill Dunnigan boarded his coach train . He had not phoned any of his friends to say good-by . He traveled alone , except that ( like the refrain of the old ballad ) the body of his dearest pal was " in the baggage coach ahead . " " Low " did not adequately express his mood . " Lifeless " might have . He speculated no more on life and love and eternity . Hegave up utterly trying to figure out what it was all about . To hell with it ! - 24HE MIND of William Dunnigan had wandered back to fabulous Hollywood , but his feet were now mounting thewooden steps that led up to the raised lawn of the shabby Church of St. Michael the Archangel and its adjoining parish house in unfabulousCoaltown . Again he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BELLSheel of his shoe caught in a jagged space where part of a step was missing . The press agent swore , and focused his attention on the buildings before him . They did not improve with a face-to-face view . Undertaker Orloffhad spoken of the church as " going to pieces . " In a physical sense it did seem to Dunnigan that the disintegration was the result of poverty rather than purposeful neglect . He had noted from across the street that the grass lawn was well kept and green . The geraniums in the circular flower bed between the two structures were bright red , and the sod about them had been newly spaded . A quaint border of small , white flowers was carefully planted around this bed . It was the wretched frame buildings themselves that needed repairand a coat of paint . Several coats . He saw why the church seemed to lean  --  like an unlovely tower of Pisa . The stone foundationsalong the parish house side had sunk too deeply into the sod . The front of the small , dingy parish house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards back from the embankment . The front of the church was separated from the top of the wooden steps only by a concrete walk , from which several stone steps , flanked by a wooden handrail , led up to the church doorway . Dunnigan followed around the narrow , concrete walk , and crossed the several yards of lawn to the side door of the parish house , which seemed to be its used entrance . There was a dark scowl on his face . He did not relish the task before him . Bargaining with an undertaker had been sordid enough . Now , with only a small sum left in his wallet , he must bargain with a worthless priest , to arrange for the final details of Olga Treskovna 's funeral . There was something especially obnoxious about haggling with a priest . It seemed almost indecent . He hoped this Father Paul was in . He already despised the man and he wanted to get through with the unhappy business quickly . Anyway , some hundred and fifteen dollars was all that he could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrangled over ! Dunnigan mastered his distaste , mounted two more steps to aTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 109small side veranda , and looked for the bell . It was not an electric bell , but an old-fashioned knob that you pulled outward . He gave this bell-knob a vicious jerk and could hear the prolongedjangle inside . He stood waiting , impatiently . THE BELL 'S JANGLE disturbed the thoughts ofa youngish man seated in a small , bare room just off the entrance hallway on which this side door opened . He wore a long , black cassock . He was seated at a narrow desk , which , with the excep- tion of two folding chairs , was the room 's only furniture . He had been sitting there for the past hour , and held in his hands a sheaf of bills . Unpaid bills . The top one was for church candles , went back several months , and amounted to some sixty-odd dollars . The state of mind of this man was not much different from that of the one whose ring disturbed his thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nothing of bitterness in them . This priest was Father Paul . If you had given him a second glance , which you would not , you would have described him as " in- significant . " The thin , undersized body was topped by a small head for which the prominent nose and ears were a size too large . And the chin was not strong enough for the nose . Since his church served the Polish population , he was a Pole . He had been born and reared in near-by Scranton . He looked to be and was about thirty years of age . He had not been thinking of the unpaid bills he held before him , except as they were a tangible evidence of his life 's inefficiency . He was thinking that as a priest he was a complete failure . How much longer could he go on ? He had had every chance , he told himself , as he now reviewed his " career . " His widowed mother had used most of her meager earnings as a " dressmaker " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the priesthood . How proudly she had watchedIIO THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSwhen he was ordained and said his first Mass at the Cathedral in their native Scranton ! He knew that she had visioned through misty eyes her son as someday a Bishop  --  a Cardinal  --  even ( if God were good ) a Pope ! So dream all mothers and there is no folly in their dreams . In that great democracy of the Church , peasants haveworn the Triple Crown ! He  --  the Pontiff of Christendom ! Not that Father Paul himself had ever had any such lofty dreams or ambitions . His ambition was a simple one  --  to serve his fellow man . What was wrong ? Why was he such a failure ? He really did not know . He only knew he had not even " made good " as a parish priest ! Father Paul was almost glad his mother had not lived to witnesshis present state . This mother had known that her son had faith . That he wanteddevoutly to live like , and carry out the teachings of , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little when less ferventlyreligious but more personable young men moved ahead of her son up the golden ladder . Were sent to thriving parishes . It had disturbed Father Paul also . To be pure in heart , to be humble , did not seem to be enough in a practical , commercial era . But the mother 's basic faith never faltered . She prayed each day to that Blessed Mother who would understand the hopes of mothers . And at last , the Bishop , whom she knew and whom she had never ceased to importune , told her he was giving the lad a church in Coaltownwhere an elderly priest had died . The Bishop did not tell her it was an unwanted church , so rundown at the heel that it might soon possess no heel at all ! It would not have mattered if he had . Her son would at last have a parish ! Her boy was on his way to high advancement ! She had died feelingthe certainty of a dream fulfilled . The dilapidated state of the affairs of St. Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had one feature that told of an inner fire of which the outer face and body gave no trace . The eyes were unusual . They mirrored his ardent , unselfish soul . They mirrored , also , this inner flame for God 's tasks . He saw in the run-down condition of St. Michael 's his opportunity  --  his life work . He would first , of course , administer to the spiritual needs of his flock . But besides that , he- would work for their physical welfare and their mental progress . He would searchTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS IIIout unhappiness , illness , unnecessary poverty , and not just wait till they came to him . He would start at the root of the drab existence in these mining towns . With better sanitation and health knowledge , with some cultural interests even , he would show these people how to Iift themselves out of their black environment . Did not the Master start with the healing of physical needs ? Then , with clear lungs and alert minds , these people would breathe more deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was plenty of unhappiness , illness , poverty to tilt at , but the contented possessors of these attributesentirely misunderstood Father Paul 's solicitude . His rounds of calls were considered prying into personal affairs . His kindly questions and suggestions the further proof of it . Was he trying to find out how much money they had ? Why could n't he stay in his church where he belonged ! When they wanted him they would send for him . He need not snoop around and give advice about health . He looked none too healthy himself ! Father Paul could cook , liked to cook , and when he had the temerity to suggest that pork chops fried in deep lard were not the ideal diet for an ailing child , it was going too fall Coaltown had cooked in deep lard for years . Worse was yet to come . It was reported one day that Father Paul had given some sort of " absolution " to a dying Jewish peddler , for there was no Rabbi in the place . He had heard of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the town . Perhaps this young priest was not even a good Catholic ! He had attempted to justify his action to a " committee " that questioned him about it by saying that the peddler believed in the same God they did  --  was going to meet the same God that would greet them ! Attendance , never large , for the church was a small one , fell off steadily . Parishioners transferred their worship to other churches whose priests spoke ardently of hell-fire on Sundays and who let hem alone the rest of the week . Thus , the practical result of three years of effort was near finanialdisaster to St. Michael 's . The collections consisted mostly of pennies . The building became more weatherbeaten each year . l here was no money to repaint it . There was no money to rebuild its foundations which were sinking because a mine shaft had been112 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSdriven beneath them . There was not even money to pay the bills for altar and shrine candles . Coaltown had almost crushed Father Paul  --  defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treskovna . Just as it was crushing Bill Dunnigan . You could not fight the Breaker and its works ! Such was the man and the disconsolate reverie that the ring of a very irritated Bill Dunnigan interrupted . Father Paul sighed , put the unpaid bills down on his desk , arose from his chair , went to the door and opened it . Dunnigan surveyed the unattractive priest . The irritation in the press agent 's steel-grey eyes hardened . o contempt . He was thinking : So you are Coaltown bastard Number Two that I must bafflewith ! " Are you Father Paul ? " he demanded aloud . " Why , yes  --  I am Father Paul . " As this priest only stared back and made no move of invitation to enter , Dunnigan abruptly stated his business . " My name is Dunnigan . I have the body of a girl , who was a parishioner of your church , across the street in the undertaking place . She has a plot in your cemetery where her father is buried . Paid for in full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you call a clnrrcll funeral tomorrow . How much do you charge ? " The truth is that Father Paul , usually calm , always courteous , had been very much startled by the appearance and the abrupt demandof this stranger . Startled and alarmed . On first opening the door he had thought he was confronting an aggressive salesman or a bill collector . Salesmen came occasionally with wares that ranged from church supplies down to assorted brushes and " investment securities . " None-too-polite collectors had been appearing lately with more than comfortable frequency . He quickly became himself . " Come in , " he said in a friendly voice . He led the stranger to the small room . " Please have a chair . " He indicated one of the two folding chairs opposite the desk , and Dunnigan sat down stiffly , holding his derby in his lap . Father Paul was trying to be courteous , but he did not care for the harsh , almost insulting tone of this stranger when the man had stated his errand . Still , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BELLS 113someone demanding to pay money ! A practical mind ( even of a religious turn ) would have seen the heaven-sent answer to some of those bills on the desk . It did flash across the little priest 's consciousness . But only for a second . What disturbed him now was that there had been a need in his parish  --  an illness  --  a death  --  that he had been entirely ignorant of . He hastened to say , " I did not know there had been a death in my parish ! I am sincerely sorry to hear it . Had I been informed of the illness , I would have been at your service , sir , before . " Father Paul had seated himself behind his desk and was leaning forward in his anxiety . " Oh , she died in California , " Dunnigan answered impatiently . He did not like the intense way the priest looked at him . In all likelihood he was again being sized up for what he was worth . He noted that his financial question had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only an hour ago , " he continuedwith rising irritation , " telegraphed your local undertaker who met me at Wilkes-Barre . The girl 's father 's name was StanislausTrocki . Hers , Olga Trocki . If there 's anything due on the father 's funeral service  --  it was four or five years ago  --  I 'll square it before we talk business about the daughter 's job . " He produced his wallet and placed it sharply on the edge of the desk . The name of " Trocki " in Coaltown seemed to call for a show of currency . What he wanted out of this priest was  --  How much ? The unpaid bills lay before Father Paul . His eyes were drawn toward the top one . Across its bottom was stamped in red , inside a blatant red square of heavy border , the wordsOVERDUE ! PLEASE REMIT ! Dunnigan could not help but see these large words across the small desk . A mental sneer lowered the corners of his mouth . Even religion in Coaltown seemed primarily concerned with money and accounts ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frowned . He took up the bills hastily , folded them , and placed them in a drawer . " I was looking over some accounts when you came , " he said , and then , as if he must explain , " It is a part of my duty . " 114 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS " I 'll do my business strictly on a cash basis , " snapped Dunnigan . " The father 's account first . " Father Paul was now really annoyed by this ill-mannered stranger'spersistent references to money . However , he did not changehis tone . " It was not God 's will that I serve here four years ago , " he said quietly . " I would not know about a service then . I recently destroyeda book I found containing a list of money due the church from its members . I did not care to have it in my desk . I am indebted to my parishioners , not they to me . " Dunnigan eyed the priest . He did not quite understand FatherPaul 's last statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thecrafty priest wished to pretend generosity regarding any old accounts , in order to charge more for a new one ! The press agentwanted the all important money question answered . How much ? He now gave that question to the priest in such vehemence  --  aswould end fencing . " I believe there was nothing due anyway about the father'sburial service , " he barked . " The church got its ! I just wanted to be sure . Now we can get down to our present business . " " Please do , " said Father Paul . " I 'd like to know your cash charge for a Mass , a funeral service , and  --  let me see  --  " ( again Dunnigan looked at his notebook ) " the organ to be played  --  and perhaps you priests understand this , sixgirls with wings to stand beside the coffin . ' I 'll pay in advance for all of it , without bargaining , if the amount is n't beyond my means . And perhaps you will be kind enough to make me out a bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the priest'sdesk . He wanted this distasteful transaction completed without furtherdelay . Father Paul , taking cognizance of this gesture , and the implicationsin the words preceding it , raised his eyes to those of Bill Dunnigan , and the press agent noted for the first time their strength anddepth . And the flash of anger , also , that flared within them . It was not only the people of Coaltown , thought Father Paul , whocould not understand ! This outsider even  --  with his insulting rude-ness  --  - But hold . Maybe it zees his own fault : Maybe that was what wasTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS II 5wrong with him as a priest . He just did not have the grace to conveyhis meaning to others . The anger subsided , and intense sorrow replaced it . Sorrow for himself . Sorrow that there were so many people in the world who could not believe in brotherly love  --  in honesty  --  in helping your neighbor as you yourself would be helped . When he spoke at last there was no anger , but his voice held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do  --  for whatever my humble church can do  --  there will be , if I may use your words , no cash charge . So I 'm afraid I can not make you out a bill . " " You mean you do not get anything at all for the Mass ? And for the use of your church ? " " I make no financial charge . " There was such a bewildered look in Dunnigan 's eyes that Father Paul now really felt sorry for the man . He felt that he must ease the situation by the mention of something that could be paid for . " I believe our organist receives three dollars for playing at a funeral , " he said . " You can pay her directly . But I have found that she will gladly play without charge , if no funds are available . My organist is a blind woman , but very talented . I understand , as a priest and a Pole , what the departed one meant by girls with wings , ' " and a brief smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polish birthright . It is one of our most happy customs brought from the older country , and used when a child is confirmed . We had such a Confirmation last Sunday . I am sure I can find six children who will be glad to serve . These children do not charge , sir , for their services . " Father Paul 's lips seemed now almost ready to smile , but the matterbrought no humor to his caller . " I did n't mean that the children would charge ! " exclaimed a flusteredDunnigan , " but you yourself  --  you must charge something ! There must be a funeral fee ! " This was completely cockeyed ! And Dunnigan knew he was trying to defend his own brash manners . He felt his face becoming very red . Father Paul realized Dunnigan 's acute embarrassment , and now he really smiled  --  an open , friendly smile . " If you desire to make an offering to the blessed Saint Michael  --  he is our Patron Saint -- 1.16 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSFather Paul indicated a colored Polish lithograph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framed on the wall at Dunnigan'sback  --  " my church will , of course , receive it , and be grateful . But I assure you , it is entirely voluntary . There is no obligation on your part to do so . " The hard-pressed priest really meant what he said ! This was no " act . " Turning back from the poster-like picture of Saint Michael and looking into the clear , glowing eyes of the living man of God opposite him , Dunnigan could not doubt it for a second . The press agent 's own eyes lowered and lit on the wallet he had so cynically placed on Father Paul 's poor desk . It was a long , handsomewallet of dark , tooled leather . It had often been admired . But it seemed a monstrous , ugly thing in this tiny , bare room whose furnishings were three folding chairs , a desk , and a cheap lithograph . Something out of place and of no consequence . He took it up hastily and replaced it in his pocket . Bill 's knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind a long-forgottenSunday School lesson about the money changers being cleared from the Temple . And he , Bill Dunnigan , down to his last hundredbucks , was in the role of a money changer ! " I beg your pardon , Father , " he said . " I had you all wrong ! Please forgive me . I ask your pardon . You see , I have just come from making certain financial arrangements with a Mr. Orloff acrossthe street . " Dunnigan realized he had been acting like the cheapest heel . Rasping at this priest like an East Side hoodlum , insulting him , insultingnot only his cloth but his church , his religion ! Father Paul should have ordered him to leave . But instead of throwing him out , this gentle person , beset by God alone knew what worries , had listened patiently , overlooked insults , smiled , was willing to do what he could to help , and wanted nothing at all for the doing ! " That is quite all right , " Father Paul was saying , " the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can understand why you spoke as you did , but do not blame Mr. Orloff or hold it against him . He runs a business which has many expenses , and people sometimes forget to pay when it is all over . " Remembering the papers he had seen the priest , thrust out of sight , Dunnigan wanted to ask , " Have n't you expenses also , and do n't people always forget to pay you when it is all over ? " But heTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 117refrained . He was forming a liking for this funny-looking priest guy who even tried to defend a character like Orloff . " I 'll certainly make an offering and I 'll not forget it , " said Bill Dunnigan impulsively . " All I can afford . Father , I --  " Again Dunnigan had to check himself . He was on the point of blurting out the whole story to this man he had been despising only a few moments before . How he had met this girl , how brave and determined she had been , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of bringing some happiness even to this miserable Coaltown , and how she had been cheated out of her dream by the obsession of Marcus Harris connected with releasing a picture with a star who was dead . How he , Dunnigan , felt that somehow he was to blame for it all , because of the " jinx " that seemed to pursue everything he undertook to do . How he 'd drawn nothing but kicks in the face since he had broken the news to MarcusHarris , until he had come to the conclusion that everybody in the world was as selfish and mean as Orloff the undertaker . Had Bill Dunnigan only known how Father Paul would have thrilled because a fellow man wished to open his heart to him ! But the press agent did not know . He thought that he had no right to unload troubles on this priest who already had plenty of his own , if observation , and what the undertaker had said about St. Michael 's church , were true . And there was something cheerful he could say  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dunnigan started again , " there is one tiling I must ask you to let me do  --  for you and your church . Please understand how I mean it . It has nothing to do with the funeral service . This girl wanted to buy something for your church . Something you need . It must be simple , I 'm afraid , because she did not leave very much money . But she felt there must be something she could buy . " " That was thoughtful of her , " said Father Paul . " You see , she told me that once , on All Souls ' Day , she burned a candle to her father and mother without putting down the jitney to pay for it . She was very poor , Father , when she lived here " The priest held up his hand and smiled again . It was an embracingsmile . It was like a firm , warm handclasp . Bill 's liking for Father Paul went up another notch . " I rejoice that she did not forget the holy day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Paul said . " And I think the blessed Saints rejoiced. 1 do n't think they were worried about that  --  ah , jitney . " Dunnigan caught a twinkle now in the eyes of the priest . And he caught the friendly repetition of the slang word he had used without thinking . This priest had a sense of humor ! An all-right guy for sure ! " " Do n't mind my vocabulary , Father , " he said . " I 'm new to this church talk . But you see how it is . I must get something for you ! I 've got to ! I gave my word I 'd do it . Something your church needs  --  something you yourself really want your church to have ! " He was conscious he had added the last phrase himself . But he felt that Olga Treskovna , could she have known this priest , would have said just that . The smile faded from the priest 's face and was replaced by a look of longing . Father Paul did have a secret desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutely put it aside as such , when he had been tempted . But he had seen a picture of what he wanted in the catalogof a Philadelphia Catholic supply house . He had locked the catalog away in the lowest drawer of his desk , where he would not see it ; but sometimes , alone late at night , he would take it out and gaze at the picture . He did not mind the shabbiness of his own vestments . They would do for him , the servant in God 's house . But his altar  --  the very floor of the Temple ( as it were ) of his Blessed Lord  --  should have only the best ! What it had was cheap in texture and even repaired where it had been torn . Father Paul wanted desperately a new altar cloth . " I do want something , " he said . " And if you care to provide it , it would give me great happiness . I need a new cloth for my altar . I know I should not dream of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not help it . " Dunnigan hesitated . " May I ask  --  I must ask  --  just what this altar cloth would cost ? " He felt he had never phrased a more hateful question itt his lift ' . " Ah , that is it ! " said Father Paul . " Such things must bebought . " Dunnigan could see the priest gathering his courage to speak the ominous words  --  words that would probably end his dream ! " ' y here is one that would be beautiful for twenty dollars . It isTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 119of the finest Iinen , and , I am sure , with care it would last for years . I would wash it and iron it always myself to be certain . There is another  --  ah , but that is too much to ask , I know  --  there is another , with long fringe and the Sacred Heart embroidered on it , for thirty dollars . But please  --  the twenty-dollar one would be quite sufficient . I should not even have mentioned the other ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had looked into many eyes that wanted things , in an active life of contact with his wanting fellow men  --  and women . Eyes that wanted money  --  eyes that wanted fame -- -eyes that wanted excitement  --  eyes that wanted lust . But never had be gazed into eyes in which the wish was so fervent , so intense , and yet so utterly pure , so selfishly unselfish . He thought of the thousands of dollars that had been wasted , thrown aside , on the plays he had been connected with  --  on the pictureMarcus Harris had just made ! Enough to buy ten thousand altar cloths . And here was a man to whom just one such cloth ( cost  --  thirty dollars ) , meant supreme happiness . " I think we can manage it , " he said . " One altar cloth or the other . I will know which one the bank roil can afford when we are all finished tomorrow . " " Thank you , " said Father Paul . " Thank you with all my heart ! " " Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impose on you for some other help , " commenced Dunnigan . There was real apol ogy now in his tone . " That is all right , " said the priest . " That is why I am here . " This stranger was turning out to be a different person from the one whose bell jangle had even sounded unfriendly  --  who had towered so gloweringly in the parish house doorway a short time before . If only Father Paul could convey to him his happiness to serve ! " " We must find out right away about this girl 's cemetery plot , " the priest continued . " Yes . I want to go to the cemetery next  --  if I can , " Dunnigan said . " The girl told me that there was no stone on her father 's grave , but that you had a map . I remember that especially , Father . I thought how strange a map of graves must be ! " " I will show you , " said the priest . He opened a drawer of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrolled the chart and Dunnigan pulled his chair closer and held down one end . It looked120 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 121like the plan of a small town  --  streets , blocks , and smaller squares with names written in their borders . " The last time I looked at a chart like this , Father , " said Dunnigan ( holding that chart seemed another friendly link between them ) , " it was the plan of the Dempsey-Tunney fight arena . Tex Rickard had the names of box-holders and ringside-seat buyers written in the spaces , and a lot of customers were phoning squawks about where their seats were located  --  " The press agent suddenly rememberedwhere he was , and to whom he was talking . " That was a good fight , " said Father Paul . " You ! You know about it ! " exclaimed Bill Dunnigan . " I read about it . I was just a lad in school . I have always wondered about the ' long count . ' " " Gee , Father ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he really knew this priest ! And it was a pleasurejust to meet such a man and be in his company ! " What did you say was the family name of this member of my parish ? " asked Father Paul . " Why , Tunney -- I mean Trocki . Stanislaus Trocki . " Dunnigan had been about to tell the Father his own idea of that count . But the priest was poring over the grave plan . Bill must n't forget to tell him , however , before he left tomorrow . Dunnigan pulled his mind back to the grave chart and bent over it with Father Paul . " If there was no tombstone , maybe the grave is n't even marked here ! I suppose no one cared for it when the daughter left Coaltown . " " All my graves are cared for , " said Father Paul proudly . " You see , I like gardening  --  maybe I should have been a gardener  --  and only last week the gravedigger and I , and a poor lad I get to help us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died out . And every grave should be recorded  --  I 've found it ! Right there ! That 's on the north side , by the border fence . See ! Trocki ' is written in the space ! We 'll have no trouble now in locating it . " " She wanted to be buried by her father . " " There is room for a second grave , according to the plan . " " And who do I talk to about digging the grave ? Gee , but I 'm a lot of trouble to you , Father ! " But Father Paul 's face was getting happier every moment . " When we leave the cemetery we can stop at the gravedigger'shouse . He 's an old man who lives halfway up the hill . I had forgotten  --  you'llbe able to pay out some money about that ! " There was that friendly smile twitching at the corners of Father Paul 's lips . " Good ! " said Bill Dunnigan and he too was smiling . " There 's a fixed fee that goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be always seven feet long and he told me it was figured a dollar a foot ! Poor man , he earns his money , for our mountain soil has many rocks  --  sometimes surface veins of coal . It often takes a whole morning to dig a new grave . " " We 'll have no argument about the seven dollars , " smiled back Dunnigan . Three dollars for the organ . Seven for the grave . Total expense with Father Paul  --  ten dollars ! The money would hold out , with the thirty-dollar altar cloth thrown into the bargain . And whatever was left in the bank roll would go to Saint Michael the Archangel ( even if he did have a long name ! )  --  less the press agent 's hotel bill and the cost of a coach ticket to New York . So calculated Mr. Dunnigan . Yes , and when he got back to New York , he would turn that silly Brooklyn Dime Savings bankbook into cash , and send back a money order for whatever that red-stamped , " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he arrived . And a photograph of the famous " long count " incident , of which Dunnigan had always treasured several . He would even get the two fighters and the referee to write their autographs across it ! He 'd send the photograph framed ! He wondered if it would be proper to have the picture of a prizefight in a parish house ? Why not ? This Saint Michael certainly looked like a scrapper  --  he had a lance upraised in one hand and stood in a real fighting stance ! Anyway , this grand priest should not lose by this day 's work ! And maybe Father Paul would forget what a loud-mouthed jerk he , Dunnigan , had acted when he first came in. 122 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS11J ILL DUNNIGAN and Father  --  Paul started for the cemetery . The priest wore his long black cassock , and had put on the low-crowned , curled brim , " shovel " Roman hat that went with it . Under his arm he carried the rolled-up graveyard plan . They made strangely contrasting figures  --  these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full head and shoulders . Though soiled from the five-day train trip , his nearly-new plaid suit of pale red and blue checks on grey bespoke the flashy Broadway atmospherein which he moved . His derby hat was at its customary angle . A green silk handkerchief projected from his breast pocket . His white spats were smudgy , but they , too , were new , and the shoes that needed polishing were heavily heeled and soled , and shapely . Father Paul 's cassock was old and worn . There was an obvious darning at one tight elbow . His shoes were thin and bulged at the side  --  a small patch on one of them where the leather had cracked through . But the face of the priest was now eager and almost glowing . And his step was more firm and rapid than that of his companion . Father Paul was doing the thing he wanted most to do  --  helping a fellow man ! A thing that Coaltown had not often permitted him to do . Dunnigan glanced sideways at the frail figure that matched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little man . And a great admiration . In spite of adversity , poverty , obvious frustration , Father Paul had not quit . He was battling on ! He had not become mean and sour and bitter . He had even defended Orloff , and Orloff had called Father Paul a " poor sap . " In contrast , what about himself , Bill Dunnigan ? He had taken it lying down from Marcus Harris . He had sulked and felt sorry for himself all through that long train ride . Next , he had let Coaltownmake him as mean and petty as the meanest man in it . He would now , as quickly as possible , bury Olga Treskovna , the only girl he had ever loved , and then slink back to New York and THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 123live in deadly fear of his jinx . At that moment he , Bill Dunnigan , who had fought his way up from the slums to the top of his profession , was without doubt the world 's champion quitter ! It was the most disturbing thought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was interrupted by a question from Father Paul . " How old was the girl who died ? " " She was twenty-two , " said Dunnigan . And with his answer a fierce bitterness again swept over him . They had reached the end of the main street , past the rows of company houses , saloons , dusty stores . They were about to cross a small bridge over some railroad tracks that were submerged in a cut  --  tracks for coal ore cars . Mounting huge on one side was one of those man-made hills of " slack , " and black smoke rose from it in several places . Loaded cars were bumping along the tracks below , and the dust from them shot up through the wide cracks between the wooden planks of the bridge flooring . The dust made both Father Paul and Bill Dunnigan cough . " That was another thing , Father , " said Dunnigan , " another thing that caused me to shoot off my mouth the way I did back at your place . This girl was only twenty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she had to die ! She died because of this town , Father . Because of the coal dust that had damaged her lungs when she was a child here . She told me she worked in what you call the Breaker . She had tuberculosis . So in one hour I had come to hate this town . I regarded it as her murderer . How do people stand it here ! " Father Paul suddenly spoke as he had not spoken to any man . He bared to this stranger his own frustration  --  the thing that troubled his soul to madness . " It can be cured  --  it can be prevented  --  it can be wiped out ! Jost as sin can be wiped out , " the priest exclaimed . " This tuberculosis and the other things that go with it , I mean . The mining work must be done . Coal must be dug from the earth . But disease does not have to march with it . Disease and wretchedness and untimely death . That was one of the things I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have failed utterly ! " " Why could n't you help about it ? " asked Dunnigan . " Ignorance  --  inertia  --  indifference  --  greed . Most of all  --  my own inefficiency . There should be a hospital here . There should be a124 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSnursing service . There is not even a doctor nearer than Nanticoke , six miles away ! There should be new health-saving machinery in the Breaker , in the mines . The miners ' families should be taught the simple rules of properly cooked food  --  fresh air  --  " Father Paul made a gesture of despair . " I tried to talk to the people of my own parish . They thought I was attempting to interfere in their private affairs . I did persuade a Visiting Nurse Association in Scranton , where I came from , to send two nurses twice a week . The Coaltown people would not listen to them . Shut doors in their faces . The nurses soon gave up . The owners of the mines are not Coaltown folk . They seldom come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as the mines make money . Why , only last week I was reading about a new drug called penicillin . They say it can stop the streptococcus germs . " Dunnigan looked at this frail man . This " poor sap " who did n't know how to " hustle for the dough . " He felt that he was looking at a great man . fie felt a great , tugging urge to help Father Paul . But how ? Bill Dunnigan , the jinx press agent , could not even help himself ! " have you given up trying to do something about it ? " he asked " 1 almost had , " said lather Paul , " " but I am not going to give up ! " ' There was a moment 's silence and then the priest continued under this impulse to complete confession , " I had wanted a new altar cloth for months . I had prayed for one . I had decided I would never have one . I had almost decided , God help me , that prayer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. 1 ) unnigan ! " " The altar cloth is not important , but my faith is important , my belief in prayer . Now I shall start again . Perhaps I did not go about it the right way . I seemed to antagonize the people . Maybe there is another way . I must think hard and pray for guidance . " They plodded up the steep hill roadway . The sidewalks ended at the houses by the bridge . Bill Dunnigan was thinking hard . " Gee , Father ! " he said at last , " you make me very much ashamed of myself . " Now they had reached the top of the hill and swung around a sharp bend . They were , in fact , going back in the direction of the town but on this higher level . They proceeded a couple of hundred yards between pasture fields and , suddenly , there were the fiveTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 125cemeteries on both sides of the road . They passed the first on the left , and came to the iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arch above the gate spelled " St. Michael the Archangel . " They moved down the central gravel path between the green graves , past the high cross and its crucified Christ on a round mound at the center , and then they walked across the grass to the far side which overlooked the town . Father Paul opened his cemetery plan and they quickly found where Olga Treskovna 's father was buried . There was room beside the unmarked mound for a second grave . So this was where Olga Treskovna would sleep . Dunnigan gazed about at the plateau . It was indeed a wonder spot . Quiet , peaceful , breathtaking , majestic . The distant wooded hills ringed it like battlements , as if they would protect it from all the tragedy and sordidness of the world . The girl had felt that way about them , Dunnigan remembered . Farmlands stretched from the cemeteries to these hills . Dunnigan thought of the two poems she had written . And for just a brief second she seemed again beside him , holding tightly to his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she seemed to say , " just like I told you ! " " Beautiful  --  but lonely , kid , " he answered . " Ah , Bill , it 's just because your knees are tired , climbing my hill ! " And there was her low , musical laugh . " They sure arel " said Dunnigan ruefully . " Did you speak ? " said Father Paul . " I  --  I was speaking to the girl , " said Dutmigan . He felt that Father Paul would understand . " She could not have a more beautiful resting place , " said the priest . It was now about six o'clock . The sun was performing its nightly miracle of slowly sinking behind the westernmost hills . The thin face of Father Paul was solemn as he gazed at it . It was a sight that had never lost its magnificence for him . He had seen it the first evening he had arrived in Coaltown three years before , when , after a tour of his sordid parish , he had climbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly adopted flock . There , on the plateau , alone with his God , far ( so it seemed ) above the grime and sin . of the world , he had suddenly looked toward the western sky and viewed a masterpiece of Nature 's painting . That first evening the setting of the sun had stirred his soul . He had climbed the hill to watch it many evenings since . To gain strength from watching it . Now he could not help but point out to his new friend what it meant to him . Even after three years the priest spoke of it with deep reverence  --  haltingly  --  for mere words could not for him describe it . " Look one moment , if you will , Mr. Dunnigan , toward the west . If I did not believe in God , I would now ! Is that green mountain not like a great altar ? Those pine trees are the giant candlesticks which the setting sun is lighting . See how they seem to drip hot flame on an altar cloth of hickory and birch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with music  --  the vibrant ringing of church bells . Bill Dunnigan had not been especially moved by the sunset . He only half heard Father Paul 's rhapsody about it . Ziegfeld had put a " sunset effect " in the Follies one year that seemed just as colorful . Bill , at that moment , was thinking of several , more personally vital things . Of Olga Treskovna . She was not dead . She had really stood beside him only a moment before . What could he do for her that he had not done ? Of this gallant man of God . Could he do something to help this priest ? Of his own life  --  what was he going to do with it ? Was n't it about time he stopped being a quitter ? But he was startled out of all questioning reverie when he heard the bells . He almost jumped . He had completely forgotten Olga Treskovna 's most urgent request . " What is that ! " he cried . And something else besides Olga Treskovna'slast , pathetic wish was pounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Our vesper bells , " explained Father Paul , and wondered at the man 's sudden animation . " Our five churches ring them together every day at this hour , and when they coinci'e with such a sunset as this , they are like a glorious Holy Choir singing a benediction for the weary day . Why , sir , , But ace press agent , Bill Dunnigan , had grasped the shoulders of the priest . There was a wild look in his eyes , his heart was poundingviolently , and his voice shook with excitement . " Your new altar cloth , Father ! Do n't worry about it ! It 's in the bag ! You 're doing your stuff in front of it right now ! The thirtydollarone . One ! We 'll have half a dozen of ' em ! A new one every Sunday ! And those lousy bills of yours I could n't help but see , and those plans you 've made about doing good ! They 're on the make too ! Olga Treskovna 's funeral ! She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead for a week ! I 'm the guy who ought to be picking out his own grave plot ! But no more ! Whoopee ! " " Mr. Dunnigan , do you feel entirely well ? " gasped Father Paul . " I feel like a million ! " shouted Bill Dunnigan . " Father , you and me are going into partnership . We 've both been fall-guys ! Saps ! Buffaloed by a phony jinx ! But from now on we 're going to chase those jinxes up the alley , over the hills , and show the world what a couple of alive , two-fisted , honest-to-God he-men with brains and guts can do ! " BILL DUNNIGAN had not suddenly gone mad . It was simply that what had been called the greatest press-agent brain in America was functioning once more  --  the brain that had ranged twenty-five circus elephants up and down each side of the Capitol steps in Washington at six o'clock one morning ( the day of the Big Show 's opening ) for a startled , newly-elected Republican Congress to pass through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted the name of a certain " girl revue " very appropriately across the front of a notoriously graft-ridden State Capitol building . The brain that had not " sneaked " the ungrateful Anna Gronka into America . The external cause of that renewed functioning had been the sound of the bells of the five Coaltown churches , ringing out clear and strong to fill the whole valley with their sound . The internal cause was a mixture of the determination to renew the fight for Olga Treskovna ; determination to find a way to help this unselfish priest ; determination to restore his own self-respect and courage , and , incidentally , his earning power as a self-supporting member of society . " Father , " said Dunnigan , and the priest was still startled by the128 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSdynamic change in the man before him , " I completely forgot the most important item in this funeral ! " " What do you mean ? " asked the mystified priest . " Those bells ! I promised the girl to have the church bells rung ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is another of our Polish customs . " " But it costs money , does n't it ? At least it used to cost money . It 's something that can be bought ? " Dunnigan was firing his questionsat the priest with the rapidity of a machine gun . " That is only because we have to pay our sextons extra for this work . " " I know . And is five dollars still the union side ? That 's what the girl told me it was when her father died . " " Why , yes  --  the bell ringer and the church get five dollars for ringing a wedding or a funeral . " " And how long do the bells ring for this five bucks ? " " Why , usually fifteen minutes . In the case of a funeral we ring them just before or just after the Requiem Mass . " " And suppose someone wanted the bells rung longer than this fifteen minutes  --  what would be the union scale by , say , the hour ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had them rung as long as that ! " What was the man driving at ? " But we could do it , could n't we ? " " I suppose we could . " " And maybe get a wholesale rate -- if we hired ' em rung for , sad. four hours  --  ten hours  --  twenty-four hours  --  maybe for four days ? " " Mr. Dunnigan , are you sure you know what you are saying ! " But Bill Dunnigan spoke even more rapidly and forcefully . " Iknow what I 'm saying and I 've only just started talking , Father ! There are four other churches in the town besides yours , are n't there ? " " There are five churches in all in Coaltown . " " And each church has a head guy like you that we can talk business to  --  you know what I mean , Father  --  arrange about their bells ? " Father Paul drew back a step . " You mean you want the bells rung in all the churches ! " " Every one of ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does now . You said yourself how glorious it is ! " " Yes  --  but -- -I really do n't understand ! " THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS Z29 " It 's this way , Father . " Dunnigan was filling in with bold , expertstrokes his basic idea as he hurried along . " When this girl 's pop died  --  that 's what she called him  --  the poor kid was up against it  --  busted  --  broke  --  and there was n't any priest like you around that did things free gratis , for nothing , without pay , just because he wanted to help people  --  and she could n't have the bells rung at all  --  not even for five minutes or five seconds at one church , because that five bucks tax might just as well have been five million ! Her pop loved the bells , Father . So she made me promise her just before she passed on , that I 'd have all the church bells rung good and long to make up for the four years he 'd been waiting to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Mr. Dunnigan , that would cost a fortune , even if we could arrange  --  Why , it would be twenty-five dollars if all the churches rang just for fifteen minutes ! " Bill Dunnigan broke in . " You and I are through with ifs and buts , Father ! We 've got a job ahead of us and we 're going to do it ! And we have n't time to hang around watching any sunsets ! Some other night will do for that ! We 've got to pull up our socks , step on the gas and go to town ! " " You mean that this girl really wanted the bells of all the douches rung for four clays  --  because her father did n't have any at his funeral ! " " That 's part of it , " said Dunnigan , " but only part ! Father , what a break it 's going to be for alI of us ! And for your church ! Just leave it all to me ! Because we 've got a hell of a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and fast ! These other priest guys  --  no offence , Father  --  lead me to these bozos pronto ! " He looked at his watch . " It 's already after six , and we must get the curtain up ! , y ten ! There 's a midnight deadline I have hopes of ! " " A deadline ? " said Father Paul blankly . " Yes  --  but do n't you worry about that either ! That 's my department . And do n't be upset about these other Reverends stealing any of our show  --  they wo n't get any new altar cloths or any part of the credit for this funeral  --  you 're my little prima donna and your church is going to he the Metropolitan Opera of Coaltown ! And what an opera we 're going to perform ! Say , will those other pastors be home rich now ? " 130 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 131 " They 're usually in at supper time , but Mr. Dunnigan " " Great ! You see , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extras they are  --  to help fill up the stage ! " In his enthusiasm Dunnigan had reverted completely to the jargonof his trade , leaving Father Paul even more confused . The priest returned to the simple problem of the bells . " But if you really gave your word to do this , and if the other pastors are asked to ring their church bells along with St. Michael 's , some of them will want money  --  in advance , I fear . " " You do n't have to tell me that , Father ! " Dunnigan cried . " I know there 's only about one Father Paul in this whole damn country  --  maybe there 's a couple more  --  but not in any one town ! " He continued with an intense determination : " I 'm not flat yet , Father ! And I 've got a bankbook that 's good for five hundred simoleons more , and before that 's gone  --  Father , look at me ! I 've got a lot of faults  --  they stick out all over  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a priest  --  forgive me , please  --  but I 've never yet let down a pal . This girl was my pal . She 's still my pal . I was walking out on her ! Leaving her flat without lifting a hand ! My dearest pal ! I 'm not going to let her down ! I see a way to get her in the clear ! You too  --  you are my pal , although I 've only known you for an hour  --  that is , I hope I may count you as my pal " " I like you , Mr. Dunnigan , more than I have liked anyone for a long time , " said the priest sincerely . " That 's fine ! And I 'm not going to let you down either ! I 'm going to get you and your church in the clear too ! " The look on the priest 's face was so perplexed that Dunnigan felt he must add , " I 'm supposed to be an expert at a certain thing , Father . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time ! I do n't think you 'd understand it if I told you . But I 'm supposed to be tops at it . The cleverest guy in the game thought I was tops , and paid me a top salary for ten years . But for a week now I 've been down at the bottom of the heap . Bottom ! I 've been buried ten feet deep ! It was meeting you that yanked me up again . " " I 'm happy if I have helped you . I ca n't tell you how happy I am ! " Father Paul was not confused about that . " All right ! Just trust me , Father . I 'm going to help you now . We 're going back to Coaltown to lick the hell out of that Breaker . And all that the Breaker stands for . And some lather Breakersthat I 've been up against that you do n't know about . Lead on  --  the lot of you  --  and damned be he who first cries Hold ! Enough ! ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coaltown and Coaltown 's black , towering master . The press agent 's quotation from the Bard of Avon may not have been entirely appropriate . It was a remembrance of a few weeks " in advance " of Robert B. Mantell . But it thoroughly expressed the drive of Dunnigan 's reborn fighting spirit . We give trust sometimes without rhyme or reason . The heart sees more clearly than the mind . Father Paul , looking at the man before him , let his doubts and alarm be swept away . He did not exactly understand what it all meant , what it was leading to . His own brain was in a kind of excited turmoil , for it was impossible not to catch this stranger 's ardor . Instinctively , the priest seemed to believe in Bill Dunnigan , to rely on him , to have faith that the man meant well and good and knew exactly what he was talking about . " If your friend really wished all this  --  " he said , releasing his last grasp on caution . " I gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you my promise ! " " Then we 'll have to hurry , " the priest declared , " if we are to see the other pastors before they finish their suppers . And Mr. Dunnigan  --  it 's best you try not to swear when you talk to them . Some of them are not very broad-minded , I fear . " " I 'll watch my words , " said Dunnigan . But before starting , Father Paul knelt by the unmarked grave of Stanislaus Trocki , father of Olga Treskovna . Bill did n't know whether he should kneel or not . And as he was trying to decide , there seemed to be another figure kneeling beside the priest . A girl in a blue house dress , and the hair of her bowed head was a silken brown . Dunnigan just stood where he was . He had taken off his black derby when Father Paul had knelt . The bells stopped . The valley was silent . The priest rose and the two men hastened out of the cemetery . They walked rapidly down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , across the railtrack bridge , back into the main street of Coaltown . And part of the way , until they reached the bridge and the town , some-132 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSone was on the other side of Dunnigan , walking with him , holding tightly to his hand . And in her uplifted face was reflected the faith and hope of all the world. 28IT IS NOT NECESSARY to chronicle in detail each of the four ensuing interviews . The other priests and the Protestant pastor were at home . Dunniganwatched his words . The ringing of their church bells was a customary ceremony during funerals . Also a source of revenue . As the press agent had rightly predicted , unlike Father Paul they were not averse to taking money for that or any other proper ecclesiastical service . To be sure , no one before had wanted the bells of all the churches rung  --  or wanted them rung for a stretch of four and twenty hours ! From ten o'clock that night till ten the next , was what Dunnigan first contracted for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an advanced rate for wear and tear , if everything was entirely satisfactory ! Ten dollars an hour was the agreed " wholesale " rate of each church . The press agent paid out his last hundred-dollar bill to give each church two hours cash in advance , insisting that Father Paul take his share with the others . And he deposited with Father Spinsky ( the priest so admired by undertaker Orloff ) his Brooklyn Dime Savings bankbook as a negotiableguarantee of five hundred dollars more . That covered paymentfor twelve hours , or until ten the next morning . Another payment was to be made at twelve o'clock noon ( this at Father Spinsky 's insistence ) to complete the initial contract . Dunnigan explained that he had more ready cash coming from New York , and that it might not arrive until then . So by eight o'clock it was definitely arranged with four somewhat mystified but entirely happy pastors ( a windfall of two hundred and forty dollars each was not to be regarded lightly by any Coaltownparish ) that their qualified bell ringers should start tugging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE BELLS 133This transaction left Bill Dunnigan exactly fifteen dollars in the wallet . As they parted at the last parish house , Father Paul had another suggestion . " Mr. Dunnigan , " said the priest , " the body of this girl should be moved at once to St. Michael 's and placed in the center aisle of the church , before the altar , because the ringing of the bells will mark the starting of the burial service . " " I 'll be glad of that ! " exclaimed Dunnigan . " I did n't like at all the thought of her remaining at Orloff 's place even for one night . I 'm going there now to pick up my suitcase , and I 'll have that undertaker transfer the coffin to your church right away . " " I 'll be at the church to receive it , " said the priest , " and I must locate my sexton about the ringing of our bell . We have only a small bell , but it was brought here from Poland , and its tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . By ten o'clock , Father , there 'll be more music in this town than there has been for a long time ! " " I hope I am doing the right thing , " said Father Paul . For while talking with the other priests there had again been brief moments of doubt  --  even alarm . This was such a strange adventure for him , Father Paul , to be a part of ! But he had looked at Dunnigan 's eager , sincere profile and allowed himself to be swept along . " Everybody is satisfied ! Just trust me , Father ! " cried Bill . He wanted to give his valiant ally an encouraging slap on the shoulder , but maybe you did n't so slap a man of God . Instead he took the priest 's hand in both of his and pressed it warmly . " Chin up , Father ! " he said . " That goes for both of us ! " " Chin up ! " repeated Father Paul . And there was a lift in his voice also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUNNIGAN HASTENED down the street toward Orloff 's " Funeral Parlor . " He half realized that the people he passed looked at him curiously  --  as well they might ! For the134 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSpress agent , his head thrown hack , was singing to the world at large : A pretty girl -- is like a melody -- That haunts you  --  night and day ! But he stopped that song as he enterer ! Orloff 's place . The undertaker was in his back room , playing pool with some customers . " Oh , it 's you again , " he said , as Dunnigan appeared in the doorway . " Decided to shoot a game ? " " No , thanks . But I want to see you right away . " Orloff completed his shot , missed , swore , and placed his cue in the rack . " Be back in a minute , boys , " he said , and stepped to the doorway . " Did you make out all right with the St. Michael 's priest ? " " Fine ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When these priests need money they sometimes load it on . " " The business arrangements are entirely satisfactory . But I 've changed my plans . I 'd like the coffin moved over to the church at once . " " You 're not going to have the funeral tonight ! " " No . Maybe not for a day or two . But I 've made a special arrangement about the coffin . " " Are they charging you extra for this ? Because if you wanted to wait another day , I 'd make you a reduced rate for the extra time . " " Nothing extra . It 's just that I want it that way . " " Well , it 's after hours . I 'll have to get out my hearse again from the garage . And it 'll take a couple of men to help me with the coffin . Wo n't tomorrow morning do ? " " I want it taken there at once .

" THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 135 " Very well . Here is the five dollars . " Dunnigan parted with one of his three remaining five-dollar bills . " You 'll take it at once , please . Father Paul is waiting . " " I 'll go get the hearse now . The boys playing with me will helpwith the coffin . " Orloff had already worked it out that " the boys " would have to take their payment in poolroom trade . " I .. ucky foryou these fellows dropped in or I could n't do it tonight , " he added . " Yes , I guess I 'm lucky today ! " " There 's one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like a release , " said tMr . Orloff . " A release ? " " Well , I 'd like it written down that you do n't get a refund because I did n't harbor the body overnight . I 'm perfectly willing to , you understand , as per our agreement . " Dunnigan was relieved . No more money ! He even had difficulty in concealing a smile . " Very well , " he said , " make out your release . " They moved into Orloff 's office and the undertaker wrote out another piece of soiled paper and read it over carefully . He passed it to Dunnigan . It read : I hereby agree that no refund shall be demanded because the body of one , Olga Trocki , name on papers , Olga Treskovna , was moved to St. Michael 's Church , instead of being kept overnight at Orloff 's chapel as previously agreed . Bill Dunnigan smiled at the double identification of Miss Treskovna , and again as he came to the word " chapel . " It took many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held out the pen . " I 've got a lucky pencil .

" I suppose it 's legal  --  signed with a pencil ? " said Mr. Orloff doubtfully . " We 'll double sign it then ! " declared Dunnigan . This time he laughed out loud . And he took up the pen and wrote another large signature underneath the first . " And you 'll have to do the same for me , " he added . " How do you mean ? 136 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS " I 'd like a receipt for my five bucks . Mark it : In full settlement for overtime removal of coffin of Olga Trocki , known professionally as Olga Treskovna , to St. Michael 's church , no further charge of any kind to be made for taking same to cemetery and lowering in the day of the funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lowering in . " Orloff frowned . This was undoubtedly a concluding , end-all statement ! But the Dunnigan wallet looked about empty . Nothingmore to be squeezed from it . The undertaker 's frown became a smirk . Another finger-marked receipt was soon carefully placed in the wallet . That wallet was not out of place at Mr. Orloff 's ! " At what hour is the funeral ? " asked the undertaker as Dunnigan rose . " I 'll have to let you know in the morning . I may put it off a day . " " I must know in advance . I ca n't get experienced pallbearers on five minutes ' notice . " " You will have ample warning , " said the press agent with another smile . " Ample warning ! Now I 'll get my suitcase . I hope there 's no extra charge for storing it .

" And do n't forget  --  if you feel like a game later --  --  " " I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the " chapel " for his luggage . He said just one word to the coffin as he lifted the suitcase . " Kid , ) our star is shining again  --  arid I think we 've got that jinx on the lain -- ninety miles an hour ! " At the Wyoming Hotel Dunnigan registered and was shown to a room -- a musty , spacious chamber on the second floor facing Main Street , the one room of the hostelry that possessed a private bath . He felt badly in need of a bath . Before he took his bath he ordered sandwiches sent up and a pot of coffee . He called down to the desk clerk over a speaking tube in the wall by the door . The room had no telephone . He ordered a dozen sandwiches . Here was another day he had not eaten since early morning . His appetite had returned ! He was the old BillTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 137Dunnigan again . He shed no tears for the Bill Dunnigan of the past week . That guy was dead and buried , he hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . He got most of the coal dust off of the black derby . If only he had brought a fresh pair of spats ! But the half-dozen extra ones were in the trunk that went direct to New York . He did manage to brush up the present pair a bit . " We 're stepping out , pals -- we 're going to show ' em some tall striding from now on ! " he said to the refurbished footgear . His sandwiches and coffee had arrived and he ate and drank ravenously . " Eating like a horse again , thank God ! " he said to himself . Then he descended the narrow stairs to the lobby where he negotiated the purchase of five cigars  --  retail price six cents each or five for a quarter . They were highly recommended by the clerk . " Where is the nearest telegraph office ? " Dunnigan asked the clerk . " Nanticoke , " replied this gentleman . " But I can telephone your message from here over our pay-station wall phone . " " I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How long is that Nanticoke office open ? " Now Bill remembered the name " Nanticoke . " That was the way his wire to undertaker Orloff had traveled from Los Angeles . Father Paul had also mentioned it as being the nearest town . Undertaker Orloff had spoken of a bus line  --  but that would n't be operating at midnight . " The office is open all night . It 's a railway telegraph office , " the clerk was saying . " Splendid ! " Dunnigan did not mean the cigar he had just lit . " And this town is how far away ? " " About six miles . " " This is a very important telegram . I want to give it direct to the operator . Could I hire someone to drive me to this Nanticoke at midnight  --  and bring me back ? " " My son will be glad to earn the money . We have a Ford . " " How much for the round trip ? " " Would three dollars be too much ? " Dunnigan made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A ten-dollar bank roll . Three from ten was seven . There would be enough left for the telegram. " 0 . K. , " he said . " Have your son and your Ford here at midnight . I can depend on it ? " 13ci THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS " My son is as reliable as our Ford . " The clerk spoke with the assurance of absolute confidence . " That 's good enough for me . " The little , joked-about cars had saved his business life many times on the road , God bless ' em ! He forgave the clerk the cigar . So now , everything was arranged . The powder train was laid . The bells of Coaltown 's five churches would , in another hour , ignite the fuse . Would it be a dud or would it set a certain world aflame ? He could only wait and hope . Prayer was not yet a part of his equipment . Dunnigan felt a need to be again with Father Paul . He went out and walked the short distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had approached that parish house only a few hours before . What a wonderful thing it was to find a friend ! He parked the cigar outside . He must not risk losing that friendship ! The priest was again in the small room used as an office . He 'd just finished instructing his janitor about the ringing of St. Michael 's bell . He turned over the entire twenty dollars Dunnigan had given him to this man , for the church was behind in paying wages . That he had received this back-money was all the janitor wished to know . And he would ring the bell till doomsday for the several dollars an hour that would be his share of the " wholesale rate " ! Earlier , the coffin of Olga Treskovna had been delivered and placed in the church before the altar , resting on the folding stands which each church kept for that purpose . Orloff had removed the coffin from the outside shipping case before delivering it . Father Paul had placed the three tall candles on each side . He would light them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going through with it . In spite of any mis- givings ! This stranger  --  now his friend  --  had reached out and touched an unused chord in the heart of the defeated priest  --  the chord of romance and adventure that is hidden in all of us . A new altar cloth -- his church bills paid  --  even the possibility of having the church repaired and repainted  --  the money from the bell ringing might almost accomplish all these ! And his own house in order , maybe he could really try again with some new approach to do what he wanted to do for Coaltown . A whole new world was opening ! Help was surely sent in answer to our prayers . Strange help perhaps  --  but help Deverthele . THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 13 . EOne thing did still worry him . He voiced that worry now to Dunnigan as the press agent again sat on the folding chair opposite his desk . " Wo n't all this bell ringing attract undue attention ? Perhaps even get into the newspapers ? " Bill Dunnigan swallowed hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he always told the truth . It might be a somewhat embellished truth , but it was the truth all the same . " I 've thought of that , " he said without a smile , " and I give you my word , if the reporters come around I 'm going to tell ' em to pipe down . I 'm going to beg them to ! This is a private funeral . I have to carry out the wishes of the departed . You would n't want me to go back on promises I made to a girl on her deathbed ? " " No , you could n't do that , " said Father Paul . " I only hope it does n't get into the newspapers ! " " Father , " said Bill Dunnigan , " I 've spotted you for a grand guy . One of the best , there 's no doubt about it ! I 'll place my last dollar on you ! And that picture on your wall of the lad with the wings and the lance and the shield . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first because his name was so long  --  the Archangel part , I mean  --  but I sort of remember about him now . He was the real McCoy too ! " People like you two ought to be known ! It would n't hurt at all if something were in the papers about you ! I think it would help your church . No matter how fine things are , if people do n't know about ' em , Father , where are they ? Your Saint Michael was a fighter , was n't he ? A great fighter ? " " He was the chosen champion of our Lord , " said Father Paul . " O. K. A champion . But is he known like Jim Corbett or Jack Dempsey ? No ! And as for yourself " " But how could Saint Michael be made better known ? I haw preached several sermons entirely about him . " " I 'll tell you how . There 's a business that does just that . Makes people known . Worthless people most of the time . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have influence with him . I 'm going to see if he wo n't do something for two right guys like you and your Saint Michael . This fellow is called a press agent . " " A press agent ? " . " That 's what he 's called , And you know , Father , I 've been think-40 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSing . That 's what you need ! That 's what your church needs ! That 's what your Saint Michael needs ! Maybe even your Almighty God could do with a good press agent sometimes  --  who knows ? " 30 - EXACTLY AT TEN O'CLOCK the bells started their ringing . The bell at St. Michael 's rang out first  --  a clear , high , voice-like tone . Then Father Spinsky 's St. Leo 's joined  --  it was a very large bell in D flat and might be called the bass of the quintette . St. Adalbert , the Czech church , soon followed , and the Russian church of St. Nicholas and the Protestant church chimed in . It so happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that together , as Father Paul and Dunnigan had noted at the cemetery , they gave the effect of a choir , of well-concerted chimes . At that hour of night , in the silence of the countryside , it was an awesome sound . Dunnigan had gone to the corner of a small side street where he could be alone , his watch in hand . He had left Father Paul a little while before . Father Paul had asked Dunnigan if he wanted to go into the church , but the press agent had put that off until the next day . The Olga Treskovna he was battling for was not there . He wished to be somewhere alone , but on the sidelines where he could view the " audience " when it all started  --  just as he always liked to stand by himself at the back of the orchestra during the opening night of his new shows on Broadway . Outwardly calm , he was far from placid within . He had had a feeling also that Father Paul preferred t ; o be alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingled tones issuing from the live church towers smote the night air above Coaltown , Bill Dunnigan felt frightened for the first time in his life . A gambler all his years , he had never before shot the dice for such vital stakes . He had never risked everything that was dear to him on a single throw ! If a show failed , if a certain horse did not win , if the dice rolled a " box-car , " there were other shows , other races , other throws . Now , THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS ' 4ait seemed , all depended on this startling single cast  --  the future of OIga Treskovna , the future of Father Paul , his own future . For Olga Treskovna had a future also . Bill no longer thought of her as being dead . He looked up toward the heavens . He was instinctively searching for Olga Treskovna 's star . He found it easily ; it was big and glowingnear its little group . Brighter , he thought , than ever before . He did not realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brighter . He only knew that its steady glow gave him courage . " Your spotlight is sure blazing again , kid  --  and our curtain 's up ! " he said aloud , He did not have long to wait for the first reaction . Father Paul 's fears that all this bell ringing would " attract undue attention " had not been groundless . By ten-three on Bill 's watch , the assorted late patrons of the town 's twenty-two assorted bars had left their drinks , their laughter , their argument , had disgorged onto Main Street , and stood gazing up at the black sky . " What 's happened ! " " Where 's the fire ? " " Who 's ringing all the bells ? " A continuing bong ! bong ! was the only answer to the questions ! By ten-five the juke-box dancers at Nick ( brother of undertaker James ) Orloff 's Dance Hall had left their gyrations and added a feminine flavor to the crowd , as well as a show of youth . " What 's doing ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten-ten there was a rapid-fire blazing of lights in the windows of every house whose occupants had retired for the night , and questions were shouted from open doorways by silhou etted figures ( male and female ) in various stages of undress and variousassortments of night clothes . The sound even penetrated to the night shift working in the Breaker , for at exactly ten-twelve , as if by previous agreement , that monster suddenly became silent , because its entire crew of more than a hundred men had stopped work and rushed into the street to discover the reason for this melodic clangor . The Breaker seemed to acknowledge momentarily the futility of raising its hoarse voice in competition with the clear , resonant singing of the bells . The ringing even penetrated into the mine shafts , and workers142 THE N11RACLE OE THE BELLSdropped their tools and listened in wonderment . Only the night shifts , far underground at the two-thousand-foot lower levels , toiled on undisturbed . It was quickly decided that this nighttime hubbub had nothing to do with the mines . There had been no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bells were not ringing to give an alarm of fire . No red flames , except the occasional ones from a " slack " mountain , licked upward into the night skies . Nor was Coaltown being invaded by any foreign foe from Mars or nearer places , unless the invaders were the occupants of half a dozen alien motorcars , that had been loafing along near-by roadways , and who had hastened to Coaltown 's Main Street to gawk with its citizens into the void of this unanswered auditory phenomenon . It was the wife of the town 's druggist , Cilka Shocn , who had the first sensible , the first brilliant idea . Cilka was in a ferment . As she carried close to two hundred pounds of energetic avoirdupois , it was quite an agitation . For fifty years nothing had happened in Coaltown that she did not know about  --  usually well in advance . Now , here was a tremendous event , the happening of which , the meaning of which , she was in abysmal ignorance of ! She was near to a mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her only saving anchorage to sanity . No other woman had beaten her to the kill ! Cilka , bringing to bear the powers of a highly acquisitive brain trained by a lifetime of ferreting out and analyzing other people 's business , expounded her idea to the crowd gathered outside her husband 's store . " This noise comes from the church bells ! The church bells are in the churches ! They do n't ring by themselves , do they ? Someone is ringing them ! Someone in the churches knows what 's up ! " Inescapable logic ! Cilka started off in the direction of the near-by St. Leo 's hell tower . Bells in Coaltown were rung by men , so praise God it was no other woman who knew the answer ! Even while Cilka was telling the gaping crowd her theory , Bill Hannigan would have been pleased to know that the circles of his bell-sounding pool were reaching the outer world . Cilka 's husband , inside , was answering a telephone call from the editor of the semi weekly Nanticoke Courier . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE BELLS 143 " What in hell 's happening in Coaltown ? " this editor demanded . " I do n't know , " wailed druggist Shoen , who had a high-pitched voice . " Nobody knows ! But I know this . My wife will soon find out ! I 'll ring you right back ! " Reaching St. Leo 's at the head of a throng that might have posed for a miniature scene depicting the march on Versailles by the French patriots of the time of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI , the hefty Cilka bade them wait and climbed the steep ladder up into the St. Leo bell tower . Head and shoulders projecting through the trap door , she faced its sexton , who was very deaf . This sexton was methodically tugging at his bell rope . After much shouting , for the man would not stop his ringing , Cilka only elicited that he " did n't know nothing ! " Somebody had died , that was all . It was some sort of special funeral . " Who has died ? " shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " shouted back the occupied sexton . " But you must know ! " screamed the frantic Cilka . " Who 's payingyou ? " One thing was certain . This man would not be ringing his bell without pay . " Father Spinsky  --  and he 's not dead ! " " When do you stop ringing ? " " What ? " " When do you stop ringing ? " " I do n't stop . I ring all night . " " All night ! " " You heard me . All night ! And my brother takes my place in the morning . All day tomorrow . That is , if this bell rope holds out . If you see Father Spinsky , tell him I 'm worried about this rope ! I hope it lasts , for my brother and I can use the money we 'll be getting " But Cilka was struggling backward down the ladder . You could n't get any satisfaction from such a dumb one whose only interest was bell-ringing pay and the strength of bell ropes ! Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Leo 's gigantic D flat bass . She would have to brave the wrath of Father Spinsky for an interview at this late hour . But when she reached the outside of the tower , her opportunity was gone and her followers had escaped her. 144 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSMary Spinsky , Father Spinsky 's sister , who kept house for the St. Leo pastor , had lured them away with real , first-hand information , which she was now handing out in front of the St. Leo parish house . Dunnigan had extracted promises of silence from the four pastors when he made his arrangements for the bell ringing . " This must be a strictly private matter , " he had repeated , which had somewhat reassured Father Paul . But Mary Spinsky , a native of Coaltown like her brother , had probed from him all available data five minutes after the bells started . She , too , gave a solemn promise to be silent , but when she heard that Cilka Shoen was in the St. Leo bell tower , promises went to the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ druggist 's wife to the draw in a duel of gossip . This was her hour of triumph . She spread the information to all who would listen . So by ten-thirty , the following pertinent " facts " were established by the now wide-awake citizenry of Coaltown : r . The daughter of the town 's late drunkard , Stan Trocki 's girl Olga , had died in California , and her body now lay in the church of St. Michael the Archangel. 2 . She had become " immensely wealthy , " because her body had been transported clear across the continent , and there was money enough to ring all the church bells in Coaltown for twenty-four hours  --  some said an entire week ! 3 . The arrangements for the bell ringing had been made by a New York millionaire  --  husband or friend ( it was not certain ) by the name of William Dunnigan , who had checked in at the Wyoming Hotel. 4 . This girl , Olga Trocki , had " gone on the stage . " She had actuallybeen seen in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before , by two of the informants , sex male. 5 . She had lately been in " moving pictures " in Hollywood and used a " stage name . " Her salary had been ten thousand dollars a week . So , by ten forty-five , almost everyone in Coaltown  --  with the exception of young mothers who faced the problem of coaxing their children back to sleep under the continued bell ringing  --  was in a high state of agreeable excitement . The one other exception was James Orloff , undertaker . Mr. Orloff had been as mystified and made as curious as everyoneTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 145else by the sudden booming of the church bells at ten o'clock . He had perilously left his game of pool  --  there was a dollar and a half at stake and he was winning to find out what it was about . The only person , except for the five pastors , who had actually talked with this Mr. Dunnigan about the funeral , he was among the first to piece together the " facts . " When he realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale , and his stomach had a very sick feeling . He did not go back to his game . He retired to his " office , " locked the door , and poured himself a stiff drink . He contemplated a carbon copy of a bill for this funeral signed by him " Paid in Full . " The bill was for one hundred and twenty-five dollars . And he had completely " released " the body for an additional five dollars . Released it both under her real and her professional name . This careful identification at his own suggestion ! And that cursed final receipt he had given Dunnigan . Not a single loophole left ! That dirty city cheat ! He had been dealing with a millionaire ! There was no justice or honesty in this world ! Millionaire Dunnigan was not in his room at the Wyoming Hotel . The crowds on Main Street had become such that he felt it safe to join them , and he pushed his way along , a not uninterested observerof the growing excitement . There was a smile on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a show ! The bells sure sounded grand ! In the still night air their chiming must carry for miles ! He wondered if they could be heard in Wilkes-Barre and Scranton . Too bad New York and Philadelphia were so far away ! And Hollywood ! But he could n't rearrange geography . A crowd of two hundred or more soon gathered in front of tl dark parish house of the church of St. Michael the Archangel . A miner , prodded by his friends , mounted the steps from the street and rang the jangling bell repeatedly . Father Paul had gone to bed . But he was not asleep . He lay wide-eyed , listening to the clangor that burst through his open window  --  thatseemed to be coming even from the walls and ceiling ! At first he had been terrified but soon it sounded beautiful , even restful . He had a feeling that God 's voice was at last speaking out in Coaltown . God 's bells . Then came the jangling of his own doorbell  --  a bell with no146 THE MIRACLE OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears , and at first he thought to ignore it . But when it continued , he got up , put on his cassock like a nightrobe , and descended in some apprehension to his door . When he opened the door , a silence fell over the gathering that had followed the bold miner up to the lawn of the parish house . To arouse a priest in the middle of the night was not something usually done , except for approaching death . But overwhelming curiosity can break down all usages . The miner who had so courageously pulled Father Paul 's bell knob lost some of his assurance as he faced the apparently rudely awakened priest . He removed his cap and shifted from one foot to the other . " Father  --  we --  " he stammered . He mistook Father Paul 's alarm for anger . A voice from the safety of the crowd spoke up . " What is it all about , Father ? " and another , " Tell us , Father , are the bells to ring all night ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respectfully ask who had died  --  and if we could do anything . " He added the last as if to explain their breaking in on the pastor 's rest . Father Paul 's priesthood training of calmness before an audience stood him in good stead . He raised his hand . " I appreciate your desire to be of service , " he said , " but there is nothing any of you can do . Except of course to pray , as we all should , for the soul of the faithful departed . Her name was Olga Trocki  --  she left Coaltown before I was privileged to come here . I have promised not to talk about her wish to have the bells of the churches rung . They will be rung all night , and I hope their musicwill bring thoughts of God to your hearts and minds . Her mortal body now rests in my church which is closed for the night . There will be the usual morning Mass at five forty-five . Go home , my children , and God be with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Father Paul made the sign of the cross and closed his door quickly . He was not quite as calm as he had pretended to be . As he climbed the stairs to his room , he was again perturbed by all this agitation . At the same time he felt a curious elation in his soul . His church of St. Michael was at last an object of interest . THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 147People had come to its doors at this late hour . Perhaps more than the usual ten or twelve communicants would attend the early morningMass . When Father Paul closed his door , someone in the crowd suggestedthat they move to the Wyoming Hotel where this dead girl 's friend was said to be stopping . The millionaire who was paying for all this  --  handing out " right and left " dozens of hundred-dollar bills ! At least , it was so reported , and there was much debate as to whether it was the Trocki girl 's money or his own . This stranger seemed the only remaining source of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31  --  . a ...  --  . AT ELEVEN-THIRTY , William Dunnigan strode into the lobby of the Wyoming Hotel . There awaited him , besides more than three hundred townspeople , the editor of the semi-weekly Nanticoke Courier , four reporters from the three Wilkes-Barre newspapers and two from Scranton , and an Associated Press man and a network radio commentator from the latter city . There was a wild rush in the direction of the derby-topped figure even as the night clerk started to point out " Mr. Dunnigan . " The press agent found it difficult to suppress his exultation . His trained eye spotted the reporters at once . It seemed that Father Paul 's great dread was about to befall  --  the strange happenings in Coaltown were going to " get into the newspapers . " Dunnigan received the newspapermen and the radio commentator , and as many of the Coaltown curious as could crowd around them , in the dingy parlor of the hotel . He stood by the mantelpiece , one arm resting just below a faded crayon drawing of " The Stag at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the press . " My friends , " he said , " I beg of you not to make anything of this . I am only carrying out the sacred last wishes of a simple girl , born148 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS and raised in your beautiful hill country . We all , I suppose , want to find our final resting P lace where we were born and nurtured through childhood . No matter how far afield we go , we want to come home when the grim reaper calls . " " But the bells ! " a reporter interrupted . " Is it true they are to be rung for a week ! " " Ah , the bells , " said Dunnigan and sighed deeply . " Funeral bells are a custom here  --  a quaint custom brought from across the sea . I had hoped , gentlemen , they would not cause any undue stir . For there again we have the simple wish of a simple child . Though her story in this connection has its sad  --  its almost tragic background . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bells . He wanted them rung at his own funeral when he passed away four years ago . But this poor girl could not then afford to have them sounded even for the usual quarter of an hour . Poverty bears down hard when death strikes . But fortune was bountiful to her . Out in the great world her talents bloomed and were recognized . But al ways , in her success , there had haunted her the bitter memory of not being able to carry out her father 's dying wish . So what was more natural than that , when her time came , and she was now able to afford it , she should at long last do for her parent the thing he wanted most ? " And to make up for the four intervening years , she asked me to have the bells of your Coaltown churches rung for four days  --  rung day and night for her father and herself . Only four short clays , gentlemen ! A strange , whimsical wish perhaps , but I think that now this girl is happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his spirit and hers will rest in eternal content until the Day when greater bells than mortals cast will summon us all to a reckoning . " Bill Dunnigan was about winded . He took a deep breath and lit up a Wyoming Hotel cigar . " This girl  --  just who was she ? " the Associated Press man asked . Dunnigan thought he detected a note of skepticism . But the press agent was playing a game at which he was expert . He put forward no claims of grandeur , " As I said , a simple country girl , well known by many people here , " he answered . " Her name was Olga Trocki . " A murmur arose from the crowd . The Coaltown people con firmed their knowledge of the name . They had been talking it for THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 149an hour . Dunnigan heard exclamations of " You remember Stan Trocki 's kid ! " " I told you that 's who it was ! " " Everybody knew her father . Why he  --  " which statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , have preferred to let it remain at that , " Dunnigancontinued , getting his second wind and eyeing the Associated Press man casually , " but sooner or later her real identity must leak out . She was on the stage , as you may have heard . There , of course , her professional name was known to the entire world  --  the name of Olga Treskovna . It was under this name that she had just finished starring in the making of the newest Marcus Harris milliondollarfilm , The Garden of the Soul . ' Doubtless some of you recall the best-selling novel from which the picture was taken . " " I remember , " a Scranton newspaperman said . " That was the picture where this girl stepped in to replace a foreign star named Anna . Gronka . There was something on our movie page last week about . Olga Treskovna 's sudden death . " " I imagine the press services in Hollywood sent wires about that sad event , " said Dunnigan . The townspeople in the room were now really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's true then ! " " No wonder she was rich ! " " Think of it  --  Stan Trocki 's girl ! " " Her death was in the papers ! " " It also said that Marcus Harris was n't going to release this new picture , " the newspaperman added . " Yes , that is true , " said Dunnigan . " So it is a double tragedy that this girl from your Wyoming Valley had to die ; for the picture The Garden of the Soul ' would have been the crowning achievementof her career . Please say nothing of the picture , please , for it will lie , figuratively speaking , in the grave with Olga Treskovna on your lovely hilltop . " " But why wo n't this picture be shown ? " the radio commentator asked . " Marcus Harris will have to answer that question , " Dunnigan said . " He had a great admiration for Miss Treskovna 's talent  --  he considered her the greatest find of his Napoleonic career , and when his grief over her untimely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full statement " Dunnigan paused . Respect for the sorrow of Marcus Harris overcamehim . And he noted from the corner of his eye that the local150 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSnewspapermen and the radio commentator were busily taking notes . Even the A. P. man had produced a notebook and was unscrewing a fountain pen . " I think that such a picture should certainly be released ! " said the radio reporter . " It was a wow of a story  --  and had a lift , " conceded the Associated Press representative . He had heard of that million-copy runaway , as who had not ? " The movies could do with less gangster trash and give us a yarn like that , " he added . " With all due respect to personal grief and loyalty , they should n't deprive the public of a fine picture ! " said the uninhibited radio commentator . " I happen to know Marcus Harris . If I can reach him I shall talk to him by telephone before my broadcast tomorrow evening . I speak at eight-thirty over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of money ? " This pertinentinterruption from the Nanticoke editor . Dunnigan noticed there was an eager straining forward to hear the answer to that question . " I really do not know , " he said . " I left California with her body a day after she died , before such matterscould be gone into . The lawyers there will , in due time , divulge the contents of her will . Great artists expend as well as earn huge sums of money . Their estates sometimes dwindle . Her estate is the inspiration of a magnificent career . I am here only to carry out her dying wishes , for which she amply provided funds beforeher untimely demise . " " Are you her husband ? " a Scranton reporter asked . " No . Olga Treskovna never married . She was wedded only to her great art . She gave her life , in fact , to finish this picture , The Garden of the Soul . ' Her doctor warned her to stop work , but she paid no heed . She carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ringing of these church bells , so was her loyalty to producer Marcus Harris , whom she felt was her artistic father . " " Did you hear that ? Gave her life ! " came the voice of a woman in the crowd . Better still , Dunnigan observed the reporters were making note of it . " I 'm just a friend of Olga Treskovna 's , " continued Dunnigan , and he realized again that he did not really think of her as being dead , " a friend who had watched her career and always believed that she would reach the heights . As she surely did . But now , " and heTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 151forced himself to think as his listeners must think , " all that is past . She 's just a small-town girl-come home . Please keep it so , gentlemen , if you feel that some note of her passing must still be made . " Bill Dunnigan took another deep breath . That crowded room was strong for Olga Trocki  --  professionally known as Olga Treskovna  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! There was no doubt of it ! And from that room  --  well , great things had started from lesser places . What you could do to one room , you could do to a world of rooms ! Dunnigan spoke the end of his oration , and spoke it especially to the gentleman of the radio network . " What an inspiration it is for all of us here in America , to think that from the humblest beginnings  --  OlgaTreskovna worked as a child in your coal breaker to earn her daily bread  --  she became the great actress she was ! Each one of us has the same equal chance of success in this glorious , free land of ours ! " There was no question about the impression his oratory had made . There was a vigorous nodding of heads , and all reporters were very busy over their notebooks . The emotion-seeking radio man , his eyes flashing and his lips moving , was almost rehearsing his next broadcast then and there . Dunnigan knew his hunch in Hollywood had been right  --  Olga Treskovna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the millions  --  as reverberating as the bells which now underlined each word that he had spoken . " How do you spell her stage name ? " the still skeptical Associated Press man asked . " I may as well get it correct . " " T-r-e-s-k-o-v-n-a , " he spelled patiently . And he thought , " Howgrand it 's going to look in the electric lights ! Even you 'll believe itthen . " Aloud he said , " But please  --  just call her Olga Trocki , the Breaker Girl . " " The Breaker Girl ! " another woman exclaimed . " I remember that name ! And she could play the accordion and sing ! She could sing well ! " " The Breaker Girl  --  good ! Excellent ! " repeated the radio commentator . " That picture is The Garden of the Soul ' produced by the same Marcus Harris who did Gone with the Sunrise ' ? " This from one of the Wilkes-Barre scribes. 1 5 2 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS " The same , " said Dunnigan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its beautiful technicolor , its fidelity to the great novel from which it was taken , will never be released .

Thanks ! " came in chorus from the news gatherers and their radio associate . Even the doubtful A. P. scribe had been won over for , as Dunnigan mounted the stairs again , he saw this gentlemanat the wall-telephone , calling for Long Distance and New York . And back in his room and looking from his window to the street below , he watched the other reporters jump into their cars and dash off for Wilkes-Bane and Scranton . Bill Dunnigan 's face wore a broad , contented smile , and the sound of the bells , filling his room , was the sweetest symphony he had heard in years ! He gave the lobby five minutes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still very occupied at the telephone .

" Your son ? " he asked . " Waiting at the curb since eleven-thirty sharp , Mr. Dunnigan ! " There was a new respect in the clerk 's voice . He admired millionaires . Here was the first millionaire he had ever known personally ! " Good , " said Dunnigan . " See you when I get back . " The little car raced through the night . The bells seemed even louder and clearer on the hills outside the town . How his old Broadway boss would have seized on an opportunity like this ! How the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had been tied up with a show of his ! Was Marcus Harris made of the same showman stuff ? Would he relent in his obsession about a dead star ? Dunnigan could only wait and see . It was now " on the knees of the gods , " as somebody said in some play or other . They were presently in the small city of Nanticoke and at theTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 153railway station telegraph office . The operator was standing in the doorway , listening to the distant clangor . He was in his shirt sleeves and wore the sleeve garters and the vizor-like green eyeshade that seem always to be the badge of his occupation . " What 's going on in Coaltown ? " he asked . " Just a little preliminary , warming-up , bell-ringing practice for the funeral of the greatest little picture star of all time ! " said Bill Dunnigan . " Did I say funeral ?

And say , what 's the name of the leadingbank here ? " " The Miners ' National . " " Good . Sounds reliable enough ! Ready for you in five min-utes ! " Dunnigan stood at the high window-counter and wrote his telegram . He had sent hundreds of telegrams in his career , but never one so important to all that life now meant for him . Nevertheless , he wrote quickly and with a calm confidence .

" Three dollars and thirty-two cents , in- eluding tax . " " Here 's five bucks , " said Dunnigan . " Get it off at once and keep the change . There 'll be an answer for me probably about ten or eleven in the morning . If it gets here before I do , please hold it . If a new man comes on , tell him to hold it for me .

Three would go to pay for this Nanticoke trip , with perhaps a dol- lar tip to the hotel clerk 's son . Nevertheless he burst into his theme song  --  " A pretty girl  --  is like a melody  --  " and it seemed to synchro- nize with the distant bells as he rode back through the otherwise silent night to Coaltown. 32 HE YEAR BEFORE , Father Paul had hopefully instituted a daily Mass at five forty-five A.M. so that such workers as desired could have the comfort of the Church before beginning the day 's toil . He had reasoned that those toiling under a constant danger to health and limb with an occasional mine catastrophe in- volving entire shifts would welcome the opportunity to pray a little before each day 's hazard . As usual ( so it seemed to him ) his plan did not gain any over- whelming response . There had never been more than ten people in the church on any one morning , and half of these were house- wives , not men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pews . There had been mornings when not a single worshiper appeared ! THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 155It seemed that miners in need of assuagement or courage preferred to take it in liquid form through the side doors of their favorite saloon  --  since said saloons could not open legally till six A.M.However , Father Paul had not given up his Mass . He might give up trying to persuade parishioners not to nail down their bedroom windows in the winter  --  to let the children bathe more often than once every month ; but something that concerned the church , once started , must go on . So he arose each morning at five , and was ready before his altar at the appointed time , though it might mean going through the service for the benefit of the four walls of an empty edifice . Even the designated altar boy would sometimes fail to appear . He awoke earlier than usual on this particular day . Sheer exhaustionhad caused him to pass into dreamland the night before-a hectic dreamland of gorgeous thirty-dollar altar cloths marching clown the church aisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please Remit " in large red letters ; of men on ladders ( they all wore black derbys at a rakish angle ) painting the shingles of the Church of St. Michael ; of his mother saying , " You 've got a parish , Paul  --  a parish of your own ! " ; of a housewife crying " I 've cooked in lard for thirty years , raised and buried ten children  --  I think I know what children should eat ! " And under it all was a metallic sound  - -  Ding ( long ( long ! Ding dong dong ! He knew now what the sound was . For it continued as he emerged into wakefulness . The bells ! The bells of the five churches . They were ringing steadily at this usually silent hour . What was it all about ? Oh yes ! The stranger from the West  --  the dead girl in her coffin in his church  --  the curious last request that she had made ! Panic again gripped him . Would all this be his final , great mistake ? His supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last worshiper from his parish ! He got up and looked out of his bedroom window , from which he could see the street and the front of St. Michael 's . It was barely daylight  --  an almost full hour before the Mass . The morning star still blazed like a bright lantern high in the pale eastern sky . A murmur of human voices reached his ears . He looked down . There were some twenty or thirty persons gathered on the steps and in the roadway ! Why were they there ? To reprimand him ? To jeer at him ? But the talk that floated upwtward was quiet , respectful156 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLSThe faces , insofar as he could make them out , were eager and friendly  --  more eager and friendly than he had ever seen faces in Coaltown . More people were joining those already waiting . They seemed simply to be waiting for the doors of the church to open ! Eagerly waiting ! Again he was conscious of the bells . They were beautiful . But terrifying also . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind and blotted out all others  --  what of the elderly janitor who was valiantly tugging the St. Michael bell rope ? Was this man near exhaustion with the all-night effort ? Had he had anything to eat ? Father Paul plunged into the business of washing and dressing . He must hasten at once to the bell tower. just before descending from his room , he again looked out of the window . There were more than a hundred people now in front of his church doors ! Waiting for those doors to be unlocked ! The priest entered the church by a rear entrance which he could reach from the rear door of the parish house . It was his usual route and led to the sacristy behind the altar where he kept his vestments , and where the altar boys met and put on their red and white gowns . This door was not locked , and he gazed incredulously as he entered . Not one , but all six of his altar boys were on hand at this early hour ! They were in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve ! " Father Paul ! Father Paul ! " They were all speaking at once . " I missed one day last week ! I want to serve it now ! " " This is my day , Father Paul , as you know ! " " No , I am the one to serve today ! " " I think we can arrange it so that everyone will be happy , " said Father Paul . " All of you please stay ! " " Hurrah ! " cried the lads in chorus . It may not have been a responseprompted by ecclesiastical fervor , but it brought relief to the priest 's anxious mind . If the children of the parish were in such a mood , all was well . " I must go first to the bell tower . Wait here for me , " said Father Paul . He had a further lift of spirit when he entered the bell tower . And he could not help but smile . The bell ringer was there right enough , and so were his two sons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking turns at ringing the bell ! Someone had broughtTHE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 157sandwiches and hot coffee ! There was no hardship or discontent or antagonism here ! " Good morning ! " said the priest , and from the excited way they returned his greeting , it was evident they were not worrying about the work . They considered it a privilege and an honor to be a part of this unusual funeral service . They would have something to boast about for days ! Father Paul walked downstairs and opened the front doors of the church . Again he stared in amazement . It seemed as though half the town was there , waiting to pass through the opened doors ! " Good morning , Father ! " " God bless you , Father ! " greeted him on every side . How it warmed his starved heart ! His face became really handsome . He could hardly believe his ears , his eyes ! In a few brief minutes every pew was fully occupied . There were worshipers before every shrine . Dozens of candles were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that these candleswere being paid for as the coins fell into the offering boxes . Money was pouring in upon St. Michael 's ! People were soon standing in the aisles , with a solid gathering at the rear and out onto the steps through the open doors . Father Paul went through the simple service of the Mass with a thumping heart ! All six altar boys assisted , for thus he had settled that minor controversy . The responses from the pews came back low and strong and fervent . It was not a part of his dreams . It was really happening ! It had never been his custom to take up a collection at this Mass . But in the gathering were two of his vestrymen of more practical minds . One was the druggist and the other the owner of a garage . Father Paul had never seen them before at a weekday service . They knew only too well the state of the finances of St. Michael 's . They reasoned this was an opportunity that might never come again . Of their own volition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the crowded aisles . For the first time in the history of this church , not only quarters and half dollars , but even dollar bills were dropped in plentiful confusion into the cloth pouches at the ends of these hopeful sticks ! From the first , all eyes had strained toward the closed coffin that stood on two stool-like supports in the center aisle before the altar . It was a plain , oak coffin with handles of white metal . Dunnigan158 THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS knew that Olga Treskovna liked simple things . At each side were the three tall candles , in their tall , black funeral stands , which Father Paul had placed there the night before , and which he had himself lit before he celebrated the Mass . Candles not yet paid for , he had mused . It seemed that they would be paid for now ! And after the service , the great pilgrimage commenced  --  a pil- grimage past this coffin that was to continue without interruption during daylight hours for four days ! This was according to the custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each observer knelt , on reaching the coffin 's foot , and said a brief prayer . And after the prayer , one usually moved to a shrine to light a candle for the dead and pray again . Soon every candle before every sainted statue was burning stead- ily in its tiny , cup-like container . Red and green and yellow and white were these containers and they gave their colors to the flame . The vestrymen  --  if not Father Paul  --  noticed that there was again a steady , pleasant tinkling sound of coins going into the boxes to pay for these candles . The alert druggist , remembering that there were half a dozen unused candle racks in the basement beneath the church , sped down to rescue them from their cobwebbed obscurity , and , with the help of the altar boys , they were soon filled with chunky wax cylinders and installed in extra spaces around the shrines . Father Paul 's meager stock of candles was completely ex- haunted by the time all were filled . His Mass over , Father Paul stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Church of St. Michael sparkled with such a twinkling of tiny , holy lights ! Never had its lonely atmosphere been so sanctified with the pungent odor of burning wax ! Misty tears filled the eyes of this simple , grateful priest . And over all , the bells pealed on in an arousing chorus , as if the whole universe were crying praise to . Heaven ! Father Paul felt proud and shaken . No matter what the reason , his church , his own beloved church , had at last been full to over- flowing ! Its walls had echoed to the responses of nearly a thousand human voices ! If nothing else happened as a result of his acquies- cence to Mr. Dunnigan 's strange request , this alone was worth it all . His despised , neglected , early morning Mass had been crowned with at least . one glorious gathering ! One thing he had attempted in Coaltown was not a complete and utter failure ! THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS 159He had forgotten to tell Mr. Dunnigan about this early Mass . Too bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be another one like it. 33 -- - Y ILLIAM M DUNNIGAN was sleeping soundly through these momentous events at Father Paul 's church . Even had he known about this early Mass at St. Michael 's , it is doubtful if he would have thought of it as the scene of any unusual happeningsthat morning . The religious consequences of his project were still a vague thing in his mind and he could not have predicted any definite , concrete results , such results as lie was counting on to happen in his own special field of knowledge . He wanted very much to help Father Paul . To put him and his struggling St. Michael 's " on the map . " He had discovered that any activity that caused people to talk favorably , or even sometimes unfavorably , about a place or a person would help to that end . That was his business as a press agent , and an uncanny instinct for creating news values had made him the successhe had sometimes been . That the Church of St. Michael would be crowded to bursting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the calculations of a man whose day did not start till around ten . The theater man had not really ended his previous day until a couple of hours before this morning Mass had taken place  --  namely , at about three in the morning . On his return from Nanticoke and the sending of the telegram to Marcus Harris , he had wandered along Coaltown 's Main Street for awhile to listen to " his " bells . That street was then almost deserted , for hard-working , early-rising folk must go to bed and get some sleep regardless of unparalleled events . Especially since many had determined to be on hand for Father Paul 's early Mass to get a first look at the reason for all this exciting bell ringing  --  the coffin of the great actress , Olga Treskovna.
