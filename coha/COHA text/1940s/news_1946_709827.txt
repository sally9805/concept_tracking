txt Truck drivers in New York City will now be making $58.90 to $71.40 for a forty-hour week . The average pay of school teachers in this country is $34.50 a week . Here is a situation that is indefensible , and in it are the seeds of rebellion that is breaking out into the open at scattered points such as Norwalk , Conn. , and of the less spectacular but even more dangerous movement throughout the nation in which teachers are quitting their profession by the thousand every year , and the new teachers desperately recruited are ill prepared for their responsibility . The facts are appalling . According to figures presented to the Commission on Teacher Education and Professional Standards meeting at NEA headquarters in Washington , 1.5 per cent of our national income is spent on education , compared with 5 to 8 per cent in Russia and 2 per cent in Great Britain . The United States Office of Education , giving figures on 1943-44 ? they are not greatly different now  --  found that the average annual salary per member of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York State . This is the average , mind you . What must the lowest salary be to produce an average like that ? What conditions in the country 's schools are we promoting through this short-sighted treatment of the teachers of our youth ? The Commission on Teacher Education , appointed in 1938 by the American Council on Education and headed by Prof. Karl W. Bigelow of Teachers College , Columbia University , gives us some of the facts . During the last five years a half million teachers left the classroom to take jobs in industry or Government service . Many young men and women capable of becoming superior teachers never enter the profession . " Since many States are financially unable to raise teachers ' salaries to respectable levels through their own efforts alone , Federal aid to education is indispensable , " says the commission . It adds , what we all know well , that the quality of teachers is a matter of deepest social concern . Clearly the question has emerged from the level of paying a just and fair salary for teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronted with a situation in which educational standards are plainly degenerating throughout the country . Cities all over are struggling with the problem , amid their other budget difficulties , and among these is New York , where a city teacher gets less than $2,100 at the start , including the cost-of-living bonus . This is $40 a week , whereas the truck drivers are making an average of $60 a week or more . There is some difference in the amount of preparation that it takes to be a teacher and to be a truck driver , and the difference is costly , several thousand dollars for a college education , an investment of four years ' time , and a steady further investment in professional education . The city is said to be looking hopefully toward Albany for help in paying its teachers more . Perhaps Albany will find it possible to help , not only New York City but equally the teachers all over the State . But the problem is too broad for a sectional approach , if we are to equalize educational opportunity throughout the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
