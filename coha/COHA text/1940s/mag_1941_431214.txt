THE old adage , " Money does n't grow on trees , " may hold true in most localities , but on the islands off Panama 's San Blas coast money does grow on trees . The only gold or silver that goes into its making is the gold of the tropical sunshine and the silver of moonlight , for this cash is in the form of coconuts . Big brown nuts from the coconut palm form the islands ' medium of exchange and may be traded for tobacco , fishhooks , fishlines , glass beads , canned biscuits , rice , gaily colored calico , or any number of things required by the Indians dwelling there . Seven coconuts are equivalent to one of our nickels , and a dollar in that strange currency is just too much loose change to carry around . There are no banks or cash registers in San Blas land . Every month or so a trader makes the round trip , providing the only regular link with the outside world ( map , page 197 ) . The people who live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tules or " San Blas Indians . " The isles themselves , which Columbus passed on his fourth voyage , are often called the " San Blas Islands , " although their official name is the Archipielago de las Mulatas . An Isle for Every Day in the Year " They are more numerous than the days of the year , " is a local saying . And correct it is , for there are about four hundred of them ? tiny creations of sand and palm rising barely enough from the blue-green Caribbean to escape complete inundation by the breakers of rough weather . Scattered over a total distance of nearly 100 miles , they stretch from a point beginning some 75 miles from Colon , the Atlantic entrance to the Panama Canal , almost to the borders of Colombia . Many are only about a mile from the mainland of the Isthmus of Panama , but are so well protected by reefs that sizable vessels can not approach . Some of the islands are uninhabited , only the larger or choicer ones being occupied by this singular tribe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sullen unfriendliness to any and all outsiders . In the course of the centuries they have successfully repelled invasions of foreigners . Once it was sure death for a white person to be found in the San Blas country after nightfall . Strangers were required to leave before sunset , and if a stubborn straggler remained past the zero hour , whatever happened to him was his own fault . By such measures the islanders sought to maintain the purity of their race . Passage on the " Coconut Boat " Eager to visit these isles so little touched by what we are pleased to call " civilization , " I succeeded in engaging passage on a trading schooner commonly called the " coconut boat . " We left Colon at 8:30 , and all night we sailed , plowing through waters that glittered and surged beneath a sky canopied with stars . Eagerly I scanned the horizon next morning for a first sight of the islands . As the dawn picked them out of the sparkling sea , they seemed like tiny peacock-blue clouds ; then , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally to a kaleidoscope of tropical hues . El Porvenir , the first large island of the archipelago and the port of entry to the Gulf of San Blas , stood forth in all its primal colors , but looked so clean and newly washed that one would have concluded its creation had taken place but yesterday ( page 198 ) . Across the bay from other islands came dozens of cayucas , dugout canoes made by burning and hollowing out the trunks of large trees ( Color Plate V ) . In such craft , fitted with sails , natives make the long trip to Colon with ease , for the men and boys of these islands are born sailors . This , though , seemed to be " Ladies ' Day , " for all the cayucas except one were maneuvered by women . While our anchor chain rattled down into the water and our engine eased to a quivering halt , the cayucas caught up with us , pushing , shoving , and ramming each other to gain a place alongside . The occupants stood up and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solitary man in his cayuca was quiet . This demure little brown person was clad in dark dungaree trousers ; a bright orange shirt , the tails of which were worn outside , flapping in the breeze ; and a derby hat ! The derby , of great age , was worn with pride at a jaunty , devil-may-care angle on his squarish little head . All the ugly rumors I had heard about the  | unfriendliness of this race were dispelled by the shining , friendly faces upturned to me . On sturdy round arms jangled bracelets of glass beads and teeth of animals and fish , while huge , flat golden earrings fully three inches in diameter reached almost to the wearers ' shoulders . Each woman had also a gold nose ring which seemed to interfere not at all with her ability to jabber , laugh , and trade in coconuts . Lone Male " Shushed " These were the business women of San Blas . Upon them , this morning , rested the task of bartering with the trader , and the burden of bringing enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once or twice the lone male attempted to advise or caution , but at once he was militantly " shushed " by the females , who outnumbered him forty t one . He placidly resigned himself then to being a mere onlooker . The San Blas women are much more enterprising in trading than the men because the women own virtually everything ( page 204 ) . A man can not trade or sell any article without First seeking permission from his wife . If she says no , the article is not sold and there is no argument about it . But if she should want to sell the beads she has made for herself , or the garment she has stitched , she does so without having to consult her husband ; it is her privilege and right . The fantastic costumes of the women blazed with all the natural shades of the Tropics ? the bright red of Panama 's hibiscus flowers ; the yellow a f the trumpet-vine blooms , the blue of tropical seas , the greens of hills and trees , the orange and browns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Large scarfs of red and yellow printed stuff were draper . over heads and shoulders . The blouses were of intricate designs and many colors . Somewhat plainer were the wrap-around skirts ( see Color Plates ) . Bands of beads were wound around ankle so tightly that they bit into the sparse flesl of spindly legs ; other bands of beads were worn on the arms in this same tight fashion . All the women were barefooted , the skin of their flat feet looking as tough as alligator hide . In the bow of each canoe were children , taking a lesson from mamma in the art of trading . Sometimes there was only one child .  | but often two or more . Not one wore a stitch of clothing , and in the early-morning sunshine their little bodies shone like polished mahogany . Here , thought I , was a real picture . But as soon as I would be ready to snap a closeup , the women would cover their heads and paddle swiftly out of range . " You 'd better put that thing away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shoulder . Most of these women wo n't stand for being photographed ; they believe their souls pass from their bodies into the lens . It 's the ' evil eve to them , and you 'd better take my advice and put that camera away . It was the voice of the captain ? a voice I obeyed for the time being . The Intendente , or Governor , came to the boat to greet us . He smiled broadly and was the soul of cordiality . He is not a Cuna , but an official of the Government of Panama . Theoretically , the San Blas are Panamanian citizens also , but steadfastly they retain their own form of chief and council rule and make no secret of the fact that they neither admire nor appreciate modern civilization . Overzealous Drinkers Clean the Beach The entire beach of El Porvenir was so remarkably clean and well kept I could not help commenting on it . The Governor smiled . " You see , " he said , " we still have prohibition in San Blas . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobey are punished by being detailed to clear the beach of driftwood and trash . The other night there was a celebration ; now the beach is very clean . " The Governor invited me to share breakfast with him . I think he was curious to find out just why I had come to San Blas . Afterwards he granted permission to visit the other islands , and also placed at my service a speedy little boat with an outboard motor that would scoot safely in and out over the limpid waters of the lagoons . A young Indian man was appointed as guide . I was delighted to discover that he was a splendidly educated person , having attended schools in the United States as well as Europe . He spoke a wide assortment of languages , and his English was particularly good . The San Blas , I have been told , do not  | forbid their young men to go out into the world to glean knowledge , but they expect them to return home afterwards and live as their forefathers have lived instead of by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged to leave their island homes at all . Harsh Penalties Keep the Race Pure These people have retained a purity of race that is remarkable in this big mixing bowl , Central America . Few females ever depart from the islands , visit Colon , or have any chance of intermingling with others . Should a woman so far forget herself as to become too familiar with a foreigner visiting the shores , she is given the death penalty . If she bears a child not of her own race , the baby is put to death and the erring mother is left on one of the tiny uninhabited islands to die . Such discipline has to be resorted to very seldom , and my guide was most taciturn when questioned as to the truth of this practice . What happens to the guilty foreigner , provided he is caught , was not disclosed . In 1922 the Panama Government decided San Blas had remained a law unto itself long enough and sent a number of negro policemen to the islands . Friction arose and the natives went on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who were suspected of being traitors . Several children , half negro , half San Blas , also were killed and their mothers with them , in keeping with the old San Blas law and tradition that there must be no half-breeds . Peace was established when the Panamanians promised to let the Indians do their own policing in the future . Since that time there has been peaceful co-operation , but it is evident that the San Blas are determined to retain their independence at any price . The Governor is tolerated , but that is all . One-family Isle for the Unsociable After leaving El Porvenir we passed Carti and N argana . A tiny island was pointed out to me as inhabited by one family only . This is unusual , since the Indians ordinarily live together in a jumbled , crowded state . The story was that the man of the family could not get along with his neighbors , so he moved to an uninhabited isle . Our destination was a little island south of Nargafia . As we beached our boat on the sandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , covering their faces with squares of gay cloth . Naked little children scampered after the women , crying in fright at the sight of me . The island was flat and about the size of an average city block , yet hundreds of persons lived within its confines . Thatched houses were everywhere . Feathery coconut palms grew right down to the water 's edge . In this soil little else could grow . It was not yet ten o'clock , but the sun was blistering hot and the glittering sand in the small lanes around the huts was deep and dazzling white . One little nine-year-old boy , proud of his English , skipped around to all the huts yelling at the top of his lungs , " Merikin leddy , Merikin leddy , " to encourage the timid ones to return . Someone had taught that youngster not to be afraid of funny white faces , for he soon came up and tried to make friends . On his hip was a tiny baby brother . This practice of carrying smaller children on the hip tends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never entirely outgrown . An American mother would have a fit to see such tiny tots carrying around mere infants . A few of the braver women came back after a while and gave me wan little smiles . But when I raised my camera , they were off again , or hid their faces behind their scarfs . There was a lot of chatter between my guide and the women , and it was explained  | to me that I must not again point the " evil eye " at them . Next , I had to empty my pockets and purse and shake my clothing to prove I had no " needles " with which to stick their arms . Some time before , it seemed , the islanders had suffered an epidemic of smallpox , and white doctors from Colon had vaccinated the populace . They now suspected that I , too , might have some wicked implement of torture . Making Friends with the Camera-shy Suspicion and embarrassment were shortlived , however , and after I had presented a few small gifts , the women were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was interested in their possessions , they eagerly displayed their bracelets , necklaces , rings , and earrings . The necklaces were made of beads , coins , and the teeth of wild animals the men had caught in the jungle of the mainland . The bracelets were of beads ; the rings and earrings of gold ( Color Plates VII and VIII ) . In bartering , the " open sesame " was cigarettes . For these the Indians clamored , and even the tiniest children smoked . Bright buttons , perfumed soap , and candies were popular , too ( page 202 ) . When I gave the children lollipops , one young mother looked at me with suspicion and snatched the candy out of her infant 's mouth so she could taste it first . Finding it to her liking , she sucked on it and then gave it back to the baby . From then on , mother and child shared the " all-day sucker , " until I began to feel sorry for the cheated child and gave the mother a handful for herself . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wax papers , fold them up , and stick them , for safekeeping , in the waistline of her garment . For this superfine gift the mother finally broke down and let me photograph her and the baby . But first she ran to get a little boys sailor suit , bought in Colon ; she seemed prouder of it than she was of the baby . News began to get about that a wake , ' ( stranger ) , was giving away sweets , and dozens of other natives appeared from nowhere . I began to wonder if the supply of lollipops would hold out . Excited mothers would run to wake up tots who were sleeping in hammocks and drag them into the circle to get their share . The young boys were not camera-shy and did much to help me , but they had a rather  | upsetting habit of thrusting their heads too close , or of pulling at my arm to see better into the magic box that so frightened their mothers . Often the women , believing only the boys were being photographed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secret Closely Guarded For all the sweets and cigarettes in the world , I could not have enticed the islanders to part with a single ornament of gold . If an outsider dares even mention the word , the Indians become alertly suspicious and see to it that the questioner leaves at once . He is not even allowed to wait until sundown . No one has ever beer able to explain jus where this Indian gold came from . Some have thought that through the long centuries the San Blas have been hostile to outsiders to protect great wealth in that precious metal or to hide the secret of a ricl gold mine . But sucl supposition is farfetched . On none of the islands are t h e r e signs of great wealth In fact , just the opposite is true . All the villages show abject poverty , scarcity of food , and sometimes actual physical suffering Perhaps the islanders do know the location of a gold mine and get a little gold from some secret place ; but certain it is that they do not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blas buy many of their gold adornments from Panamanian or Colombian traders . In this matter of their love of gold , the San Blas are akin to the rest of humanity . But their tactics of possession are different from some . A San Blas Indian would not think of stealing gold belonging to another ; neither would he lie , torture , or kill for it . The San Blas themselves seem as ignorant of their history as any foreigner . Some students believe that these Indians formerly lived on the mainland and fled to the islands to escape gold-greedy whites . Others contradict this theory and contend that the reason the Indians live here is that the islands are free from mosquitoes . Whatever the origin of the San Blas , it matters not to them . They are satisfied that they are a superior race ; they call themselves a " golden people " and feel that their mode of existence is far superior to the modes adopted by vain and foolish foreigners .  | Because they have succeeded so well in keeping to themselves and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style clothes , build the same kind of houses , and adhere to the same customs as did their forefathers hundreds of years ago . Architecturally , they possess just one design . Their homes are thickly thatched with dried palm leaves , which keep out the heaviest tropical rains ( Plates IV and VI ) . The walls are made of small bamboo poles set close together and laced with lianas , or vine rope , from the jungle . Mother Earth supplies the floors , which are brushed so much they become very hard and clean . Around the inside walls of the huts are piled coconut husks and shells for use as fuel . Here and there are nets , lines , and other odds and ends . A few stools , carved from a solid log , are placed at convenient intervals , though most of the people seemed to prefer standing during my visit . Hammocks were stretched around , for none of these Indians ever sleeps on a bed . Sanitation on most of the islands is unheard of . The huts are built so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Eaves are low and a person of average height must stoop when traversing the narrow lanes between the houses . The smallness of the homes and lanes does not bother the natives , for they are small creatures themselves and get by very well in cramped quarters . The tallest San Blas man I saw was not more than five feet four , and the tallest woman five feet two . Sometimes a family consisting of four generations will live in one hut not so large as an ordinary box car . From somewhere down the long line of generations , the San Blas Indians have inherited well-defined traditions , laws , and ways . They are ruled by an autocratic chief whose mandates are accepted as law . Eye-for-an-eye Code in Force At certain seasons all citizens assemble for ceremonial rites and dances which no foreigners may witness . While such ceremonies are taking place , no one is permitted to land . In one of the dances the participants torture themselves with nettles tied to their backs . The old code of an eye for an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Accidents are few , for if a person bumps into ,  | knocks down , or injures another , the one who caused the accident is immediately accorded the same treatment . If a man is known to have killed another , the killer likewise is put to death . Houses are so inflammable and built so close together that danger from fire is great . Once a fire is started , it is constantly watched by someone . If that person fails to guard it properly and the blaze spreads and causes trouble , the one at fault may be thrown into the fire to burn to death . But they are not vicious people , these San Blas ; nor are they sad or unhappy . They are prideful and rather jolly , and if you give them so much as a faint smile , they will return it with a hearty laugh . At night a tiny coconut-oil lamp burns in each hut . The idea of having a night light is a hand-me-down from forefathers who believed that a faint glimmer of light in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blas mind , a bat is a symbol of evil . Until recent years San Blas children were allowed to grow up to adolescence before names were selected . As J. V. Tinnin records in his book Roughing It in the San Blas Islands , the parents would call in the " singing man , " an Indian of much importance , who would sing a song composed entirely of names .  | When he sang out a name that particularly appealed to the parents , they would stop him and select that name for their child . Since the coming of missionaries and traders , some of the children of the islands have been given English names . On one island an educated , progressive San Blas man and his wife , a pretty , blue-eyed American missionary lassie , have conducted a school for several years . On argana is a mission and a permanent foreign population . Toward English-speaking people the islanders seem friendly . Many San Blas youngsters learn English if they drop their own tongue , and nowadays the boys are often enrolled in the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut I was rather surprised to see on the wall a faded picture of Queen Victoria ! Present-day Indians held it in reverence , just as their parents and grandparents had done . Victoria was still " the good white lady across the sea . " In the houses are large crudely carved " gods , " or proxies , but these are not worshiped as holy symbols and at times are willfully smashed or destroyed with no fear or concern ( pages 203 , 219 , and Plate III ) . Bird Nominates a Medicine Man Medicine men hold envied and respectable positions in the community . When a San Blas feels the call to become a medicine man , he goes alone into the jungle on the mainland and fasts for several days . If a bird alights upon him during his fast and remains for a second , it is a sign he has been selected . As a symbol of this appointment , he carries a staff with a carved figure of a bird upon a man 's head and wears a feather crown , although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties as medicine man are to keep his people well and happy . His methods are secret and magical . Instead of a medicine kit , he carries a basket containing such odd objects as bones , claws , teeth , buttons , shells , string , corkscrews , combs , colored pebbles , and bottle tops . The medicine man has a use for each one , and many are worn smooth by constant rubbing on the afflicted . If a man has a pain in the head , for instance , a skull bone of some animal will probably be rubbed on the sufferer 's cranium . For an injury to a finger , a claw bone might be used , or , in the case of leg injuries , the leg bone of an animal or bird . In the native materia medica are many kinds of tropical plants . The bark of a certain tree is supposed to stop the flow of blood . The fat of the crocodile is used for colds and lung troubles . The coca shrub , from which comes our cocaine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not use it as a drug . Aromatic gums and astringents are mixed with unguents as salves for wounds in cases where the medicine man 's methods are ineffective , and there are concoctions of bitter roots for various internal ailments . The sap of the breadfruit tree is used for sprains and swellings . There are other remedies for rheumatism , sore throat , and toothaches . With these many efficacious restoratives gathered from the jungle of the mainland . plus the power of the magical articles owned by the medicine man , the patient is bound to get well ? or die . Bark Bath to Strengthen the Aged The " bath for strength " is supposed to be beneficial to the aged . At one end of the island a cayuca , half filled with salt water , was raised about six feet off the ground by means of stilts . In the salt water floated numerous pieces of bark , all sharpened at one end so that the strengthening quality of the bark would pass more easily into the water . When we saw this bath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak old man was to be put into it and allowed to soak for several hours until the spirit of weakness had entirely departed from his body . Meanwhile , other members of the tribe were to march around the " tub " singing incantations supposed to speed the curative powers of the bath . When a person dies , his body is placed in his hammock at home and his women relatives chant his virtues . Such a death chant might run as follows : " My husband is dead . He led a good life on earth . He kept me well supplied with plantain . He struck many tarpon for me . Now God has called him . My husband has gone to Heaven . What shall I do ? " The islands are too small to permit burial grounds , so the dead are carried up the rivers of the mainland and buried in a lonely place in the jungle . Each family , or clan , has its own burial plot , covered by a thatched roof . These people believe that everything created . even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dish , or a chair , has a spirit . When the grave is filled , some of the dead one 's earthly possessions must be left at the scene . The family must not fail in this obligation , lest the tormented spirit return to get the articles for itself . Both before and after burial , guns  | are fired to scare off evil spirits who might interrupt the soul 's passage to Heaven . Although a funeral cortege is accompanied by wailing relatives , the Indians cease mourning with the burial ceremony and never speak of the dead again . They have a term for their philosophy : " I forget . " Coconut Palm is Tree of Life To these islands the coconut palm is indeed the tree of life . Besides currency for trading , it yields meat and drink , the latter especially appreciated on islands where there is no fresh water and all water for drinking and cooking must be brought from the mainland . The trunk of the palm is made into fighting and fishing implements , or cut into logs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hammock construction , and the dried leaves , tied into bundles , are lighted for signals and flares . Smaller bundles of shorter leaves make brooms for sweeping the dirt floors of the huts . The threads of the fronds are used in sewing and weaving and in forming lamp wicks and certain kinds of rope , while the coarse covering at the base of the growing leaf can be formed into hats or made into sieves and strainers . Husks and shells are burned to provide warmth and protection ; the oil and bark serve as medicines . Dishes are made from the shells , and the shuttle used in hammock construction is carved from palm wood . These are a few of the uses we know about . The very old women fascinated me , for their faces were as wrinkled as dried apple peel , and yet not a gray hair did they have ! Like other Indians , the San Blas retain the thick , lustrous hair of their youth at an age when whites are getting bald or gray . Except for luxuriant locks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon  | the race . For the most part the islanders are not beautiful , since short necks , broad shoulders , and undeveloped lower limbs give them a gnomelike appearance . Probably the disproportion between the upper and lower limbs of these people is attributable to their extensive use of canoes . Shortly after a baby girl is born , her nose and ears are pierced , and a little string is placed in each wound . The wearing of the heavy nose ring later is a mark of family prosperity , but a most disfiguring habit , for it pulls the nose down to the lip , giving a strange expression to the face . Making the expression worse , some of the women paint a thin straight line down the face , beginning on the forehead and continuing to the tip of the nose ( Plate VII and pages 194-5 ) . This is intended to make the nose appear less broad and flat . The females wear many rings on their fingers after marriage , but never before . Children Suffer " Beauty Pains " The women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a female child is about six years old , string after string of beads is wound tightly around the calves of her legs . As she grows , the flesh comes up in ridges and the beads become deeply imbedded in the muscles . These children suffer real " growing pains " which they must endure for beauty 's sake . Young children of San Blas never get cow 's milk , since this is not an Indian custom ? except where acquired from the white man ? and since there is no place for grazing on the islands . Infants are weaned from the mother 's breast to coconut milk . If the mother of a newborn child dies , the baby may be put to the breast of any woman within that clan who is in lactation . But it must never be nursed by one not of the family fold . If there are no women in the family able at that time to feed the baby , the Indians know of a jungle herb that will bring milk back again so they declare ? no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suckled an infant . Before going to San Blas , I had been advised by an old traveler to take magazines along ? " magazines with plenty of pictures in ' em , if you want some fun . " I had carried out this suggestion and , after the entertainment with the lollipops , I distributed a few colorful publications . These magazines , with their bright pages and unimagined scenes , brought forth shrieks of laughter . The eyes of the women traveled with round-eyed wonder over the columns depicting our current fashions , and those femi- nine hearts must have skipped beats at the sight of New York 's latest hats . At some illustrations there was audible horror , and at the sight of others the rapid chattering increased in crescendo until the women were almost screaming at each other . No San Blas person , either man or woman . wears a head covering for the protection it affords , but rather for the beauty of the thing . Kissing Scene Calls for Explanation Some of our pictures and ads were difficult to explain . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreter , of course ? about the picture of a young man kissing the lovely lady because she had " the skin you love to touch " ? What should I tell these people who had never heard of kissing ? And an ad for false teeth ? where did Americans get teeth like those , that could come out and be held in the hand ? Did they bite ? What were the automobiles like ? Could they travel as fast as a cayuca and could I make one for them ? Airplanes were more familiar than motor cars , since planes from the Canal Zone occasionally visit the islands . A full-page pastoral landscape showed groups of " contented cows . " How many of those queer and horrible animals did my country have ? as many as ten ? The San Blas ability to count does not go very high . Was it true that children drank milk from monsters like those and did men eat the flesh of the animals ? Better the San Blas way of coconut milk ; better the San Blas way of using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Americans did not believe ? Worldliness is discouraged by San Blas religion . The less owned in this world , the islanders believe , the more there will be for them in the next . Their gold ornaments and beads are their sole luxuries , and food is taken only in quantities sufficient to sustain life . The iguana , a lizard with . a spiny back and thorny throat , is captured on the mainland and makes a favorite dish . Despite the creature 's repulsive appearance , its meat is white . tender , and delicious , being somewhat on the order of chicken . Yams , maize , rice , and sugar cane are cultivated on the mainland under the most difficult of conditions . Breadfruit , plantains , bananas , oranges , star apples . limes , alligator pears , and mangoes are grown in the jungles , but they must be gathered before the wild parrots destroy them . To eke out an existence from the land in San Blas is not an easy task . The machete. or large knife , is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | machete and paddles his cayuca across the bay to the mainland , then goes a mile or so up some river . Here , with the aid of his machete , he hacks the ground and plants the few seeds he has been able to get . His meager crop may be devoured by wild hogs or other animals , or it may be entirely wiped out by a storm . Coconuts , the chief means of exchange with traders , form another trust-to-luck crop . It takes about ten years here for the coconut tree to reach maturity . For nine and a half years perhaps all will go well : then , when the fruit may at last be expected , the trees are likely to become the victims of an awful blight . The Indians know nothing of scientific methods of fighting tree diseases . All they can do is plant more trees and wait another ten years . The old Indian way of fishing with palmwood spears is resorted to more often than the use of hook and line ( page 207 ) . But spearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointingly small . Land of Emancipated Women The daily life of the Indian women seemed to me to be easier than the men 's . The women have many tasks , often including the carrying of heavy loads , supported by a strap across the forehead , but they seldom worry or seem over-worked and are held in high respect . The women are jealously guarded , though certainly not because of their beauty according to white standards . Being a San Blas wife is not a hard task if the sacred law is not broken the law against half-breeds . While the men are off working in the fields or fishing , the women wash their few clothes , tend the children , and do the cooking . Here on these islands is a matrilineal society . Kinship and descent are reckoned through the mother , the children taking the mother 's totem and belonging to her community . The women play a considerable part in tribal life . The San Blas women told me they pick their duties . Loading coconuts is one . After all , dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not make a chore of it : instead , it is a sort of holiday and relaxation for them . The women all make their own clothes and the men theirs . As a rule , woman 's dress is modest and simple , consisting of a long strip folded around the body from the waist to the ankles like a Javanese sarong . This skirt is of cheap printed calico and is purchased by the men on trading trips to Colon or from the trader on his visits . Cotton for weaving is often procured from a cotton tree that grows in the jungles , but it is easier and cheaper to purchase cloth . With the skirt is worn a short-sleeved waist called a mola . The mola is of true Indian manufacture and is made by laying several squares of brightly colored cloth , one upon the other , and stitching them with bright threads . Then the various layers of material are cut away in curious and shapely patterns , the edges are turned under and hemmed , and the result is a gay design of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a mola is often representative of the emblem or totem of the woman 's family and means as much to her as a coat of arms means to Europeans . To us these designs are often incomprehensible and bizarre . Some are supposed to have been inspired by the fine , lacy tracks made in sandy beaches by the millions of little land crabs that overrun the islands . The women are all good copyists , and if a bright label , travel pamphlet , or pretty picture or sign falls into their hands , they are likely to convert it into a design for a mola . There are some sewing machines on the islands , but the fine stitching that goes into the making of a mola is done by hand . When sewing machines were first introduced , the possessors looked upon them as gifts from the gods and guarded them with ritualistic care . Each father teaches his sons to make their own clothes , a cotton blouse and a pair of illfitting trousers . Often nowadays , however , these are bought in Colon or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 Children mature early in tropical climates , and in San Blas the marriage age is about 14 or less . In each island village there is a little palm enclosure or hut known as the " maiden 's house . " When a girl reaches puberty , she is taken to this place , and for four days the women of the village take turns pouring water on her . This treatment is supposed to cleanse her and to harden her for the vicissitudes of marriage . Her hair is then cut for the first time as a sign that she has reached womanhood . After the puberty ceremony the parents of the young lady entertain with a big feast to announce that she is now on the marriage market ? a " coming out party , " in our language ( page 205 ) . At this affair is served the drink chicha , a fermented concoction of cane juice , plantain , corn , and water , which carries an awful wallop . Such an occasion is noisy and gay . Large stocks of food and drink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The guests wear their most colorful clothes and most lavish ornaments and freely partake of the chicha in big crocks set on the floor . Some of the men bring flutes , and as the celebrants dance , the stomping of their feet and the rattling of the bead and money ornaments of the women keep time to the music . The party lasts three days . The debutante now receives gifts from the women of the tribe ? clothes , rings , and gadgets . They take the place of wedding presents and must last the recipient a long time . In fact , she saves some of them to pass along to other brides . The girl tells her parents which boy she wishes to marry , whereupon the father goes to the young man 's home and announces that he has been selected . This saves the girls the trouble of having to be attractive , coy , or of vying with other females for the attentions of the males . Bridegroom Must Run Away When everything is in readiness for the marriage ceremony , the debutante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back and forth . Then the young married men go to the home of the bridegroom and bodily carry him to the bride 's house , place him in the hammock with her , and swing them both . Now the bridegroom must jump out and run away , whereupon his friends must catch him and bring him back . He does this three times , after which he is supposed to remain in the hammock with his bride . If the bridegroom , in the process of being swung and chased , scampers off more than the allotted three times and does not allow himself to be caught , it is a sign he does not wish marriage with this particular maiden . She is jilted , and the father must now look elsewhere for a son-in-law . But this does not release the bachelor from marriage to some other maiden in the future . Of course , with such a system in vogue , matrimony is universal and there are no old maids or old bachelors among the San Blas . Polygamy is permitted but is rare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what young man in his right senses would deliberately choose to work for more than one father-in-law ? The mother-in-law is an unimportant person , and this is one country where mother-inlaw jokes are unheard of . Perhaps there are some good father-in-law jokes , though it is doubted that these folks are ever so flippant as to joke about anything so sacred as the family . Duty and loyalty to the wife 's father is a tradition that is not laughed away or joked about . A man 's devotion to his fatherin-law is as serious as the Chinese woman 's devotion to her mother-in-law . Divorce is allowed but seldom practiced. and a woman enjoys a relatively enviable position in wedded life , as she does in her tribal life generally . A San Blas mother knows nothing about prenatal care or infant psychology . When her time has come , counted by the moons , she betakes herself to a special little hut built for the women . Such a hut is sacred to females , and men are never allowed to enter . In this little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another soul into the world . If it is a girl there is great rejoicing , for now the father can set up his own establishment and become independent of his father-in-law . Sad is the lot of a man who produces nothing but sons ! A girl never leaves her parental roof . Sons have to leave home to mate with daughters of other clans , since clans are held together by the female line . Just because a man espouses matrimony does not mean that he becomes the directing head , arbiter , and final word within the family circle . Far from it . Even in the upbringing of his own children he has no voice until his father-in-law , convinced by the man 's years of labor , obedience , and good sense , decides that he may have that prerogative . Once there was the absurd belief among outsiders that San Blas women squatted in the shallow water surrounding the island and gave birth to their babes in the ocean . Another unbelievable story was that these women never suffered childbirth pains . This is untrue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong characters , can endure a great deal without making a fuss . If agony must be expressed , a " singing man , " knowing what is going on inside the hut , may loiter near by and make chanting or groaning noises . This is done with the hope of keeping away evil spirits , lest they take advantage of the woman 's weakened condition and enter her frail body . The male makes as much noise as he can to fool the evil spirits and make them think it is he who is ailing . Inside a Maternity House One old granny who had been rather kind to me tugged , pulled , and beckoned me to come with her to a dark , palm-thatched , earthen-floored hut . It was not until I was well inside and my eyes had become accustomed to the dimness that I realized I was  | in one of the maternity houses , rarely if ever entered by a white woman . The old woman picked up a squirmy little bundle of humanity and put it into my arms . The young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 14 years old ) watched me like a hawk . She was so tired , listless , and ill-looking that I was afraid for her . The new baby was adorable ? well-formed and healthy and a picture to behold . Already her little nose had been pierced for the gold ring it was to wear some day . I was afraid to smile down at the little creature for fear the women would misunderstand and think I was making fun . I did n't know what to do next , or how long to hold the youngster , so I just stood there , cuddling her up to me and trying to appear as intelligent as possible . Suddenly it dawned on me that perhaps they wanted me to have the baby for my own ! But I already had a little girl , my own little daughter in the Canal Zone , who was quite sufficient for the time being . It would be much better to make myself a sort of godmother by giving the new child everything I could in the way of presents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and gesticulated to indicate my intentions . Opening my handbag I found a few coins I knew would some day be made into an ornament , but more precious than the coins was a tiny mirrored vanity case . I handed this to the little mother : we exchanged smiles and she studied her reflection rather proudly , I thought , in the glass .  | Fortunately , I had on my wrist a luminousdialed watch which I offered to the mother of my godchild . I held it to her ear so she could hear the ticking and darkened the face so she could see the numerals shine . Upon the older woman I bestowed the only remaining treasure I had brought , a cigarette lighter that both frightened and pleased , a " magic flame " that flared at a touch . I 've wondered since what happened when the fluid gave out and the magic flame was dead . " Moon Children , " the Albinos Among the hordes of little brown children were seen now and then a few albinos ( Plate VIII and pages 207 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are referred to as " moon children , " a name which reflects an Indian superstition . Albinos can see better after dark or in the moonlight , since the daylight glare is hard on their eyes . Accordingly , the belief arose that these Hi- children are of partly celestial origin offspring of the moon god and an Indian mother . Poor little things ! Their bodies are misshapen , spotted , and crooked . They have big heads and thin , spindly legs : their skin is pasty white and they have stiff , tow-colored hair , yellow eyelashes , and weak , light eves , habitually squinty . Upon the occasion of an eclipse of the sun or moon , however , they have an important part to play . The Indians believe that at such a time a horrible dragon or huge black dog is jealous of the heavenly body 's beauty and is biting pieces out of it . All the time this battle is going on , the Indians must stay in their houses lest the dragon fight them , too . Only the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be harmed by the monster . They are armed with a small bow and arrows , and with these they shoot in the direction of the conflict to scare off the attacker . Of course the Indians know the arrows can not reach the dragon , but they serve to warn him and he is frightened away . When I left the island , the little fellow who had christened me " Merikin leddy " brought me a farewell gift ? two enormous turtle eggs ; these , I was told , were the symbol of San Blas friendship . Then he grasped my hand and pumped it , Yankee fashion , as some previous visitor had taught him to do , and puckered up his lips for a good-bye kiss . Coconuts Make a Hard Bed The coconut boat was filled to the gunwales with thousands of brown , husky coconuts . They crowded the hold to overflowing , while more of them , four and five lavers thick , cluttered up decks and gangways . Coconuts everywhere ! The only place to sleep was atop the stacks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Fleets of cayucas , heavy with supplies and trinkets , were homeward bound . The women sat erect as they paddled away and did not once look back . Their every motion was one of grace as they brought the handles of the paddles against the side of the canoe near the end of each stroke and then pressed downward , Indian fashion , to gain speed . In the distance , as we sailed away , the richly laden palms of San Blas rode ghostlike in a sea of onyx , stretching their fronds heavenward to be silvered by the moon .  |
