WINOM tx4141111/001 BREAD AND GAMES A Story JOHN D. WEAVER A s ALVIN swung down the beaten grass path to the trailer , the phonograph music behind the crisp plaid curtains seemed to be laughing at him , reminding him of something that had happened a long time ago , but did not matter now . He tugged irritably at the brim of his straw hat , fretting it still further down over his eyes . Time for Mama 's eleven o'clock medicine , and Laird 's wife just sat in there playing dance music . " Laird . " He rapped on the back door , calling his brother instead of that flibbertigibbet . He noticed she had strung her clothesline in front of the trailer again , her pink silky things in plain view of the road , although she knew Maud did n't like it , not , as Laird had said , because Maud wore cotton underthings . Maud just did n't think it was decent , especially with young children in the house . " It 's ' leven o'clock , " Alvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock , and Laird still had n't put his shirt on . " Lolly 's already gone up to the house , " Laird said . " Oh . " Alvin stepped back . He could see inside the trailer now , and he was surprised to find the bed made , the breakfast dishes put away . Laird was working over a strip of broken film coiled like a king snake in a flat silver can . " She took a book , " Laird said , " She 's gon na read to Mama . " Alvin stiffened . He was sensitive about Maud 's not being able to read . " I got ta go up to the store , " Alvin said , turning away . " I 'll drive you up , " Laird said . " I 'd just as lief walk it . " Laird grabbed up the jacket of an army fatigue uniform , slipped it on , and trotted clown the portable back steps of the trailer . Alvin shrugged . He climbed into the car beside Laird , staring straight ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been eighteen and Laird ten the summer their father died . That fall Alvin would have started his last year of high school , and he had wanted to finish , he had wanted that graduation paper more than he had ever wanted anything before or since . He had walked twelve miles a day to get his schooling ; six miles into town and six miles back , in rain and snow and a northern Virginia cold so sharp-toothed it chewed through his clothes . And even worse than the walking had been the town kids who used to sneak up to him at recess and pull imaginary straw out of his hair , ask him if he 'd sold his eggs yet , make fun of his made-over clothes and the way Mama cut his hair . One more year and he would have got that paper , but Papa had died , and Alvin had stayed home to run the farm . Everything had been different for Laird . By the time he got to high school the county had a big yellow bus that came right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought him , home . And nobody picked on him , because there were plenty of hill boys to stand up against the town kids and keep them in their place . Laird , without having to walk or fight , could have got the graduation paper Alvin had wanted , but Laird would skip school to go fishing , sell his books to buy cigarettes , and one day , when he was just over fifteen , he had thrown a pop bottle at the principal and run off with a circus . " I ai n't surprised , " ! Mama had said when Alvin brought her the news , and she had looked up at Alvin and Maud , as though seeing them for the first time after a long separation . Alvin had just begun to take on weight , his face rounding out , and Maud was six months along with her second child , her body swollen again before it had receded back to its old lines after the first child . Then Mama had said something that Alvin and Maud had never spoken of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever forgotten , although it was not a thing they tried especially to remember . " All my life , " Mania had said , " I 've been tied down here in this valley , them hills risin ' up all around me like a high knee , and I 've never stopped wonderin ' what 's on the other side of ' em . I was a groomed woman with a lap baby before I ever seen a movin ' picture show , and to this day I ai n't been on a railroad train . I 'm glad Laird 's gone . I 'm glad he got free . " They had n't heard from Laird for nearly four years then , might never have heard , except the war happened , and when the Army yanked Laird out of the circus , he wrote home from a camp in Missouri and told them about Lolly . " Hmpf , " Alvin had snorted . " A show girl . " Maud , hearing his pronouncement , had glanced up from her ironing , her cow eyes infinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tip of her finger , touched it gingerly to the iron , and gone back to her work . " Laird , " Mama had said , watching Maud , " would pick a girl with spirit . " M AMA must have been sick even then , but she never let on . She managed to hold out until the summer the war ended , MAGAZINE and then she could n't hide it any longer . The doctor used a word Alvin had never heard before , malignancy , but Alvin knew what he meant . And morphine , Alvin learned what that meant , too . Mama kept asking for Laird , and Alvin told her he was in the Army , and Mama would say , " But the war 's over now . Why ca n't he come borne ? " " He 'll have to wait his turn , " Alvin would say , " like anybody else . " But Alvin should have known that Laird would never have to wait like other people . Laird went to the Red Cross , they sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later Laird and Lolly came sailing home , a green trailer bouncing along behind their 1939 coupe . " Alvin , " Mama had said one day after Laird and Lolly had been home about a month , " Laird 's army money is running out . It 's time you got ' im a job . " Alvin had n't said anything , but he had thought how like Mama it was to tell him to get Laird a job instead of telling Laird to go out and get it himself . Alvin had gone to sec Senator Crouch , and the Senator had spoken to the manager of the new rayon plant , because Alvin was on the county school board and had always supported the Organization . The manager had offered Laird a job at twice the highest wages anybody had ever paid Alvin . But Laird could n't work in a factory . He was a show man . " Somepun 'll turn up , " Laird had said , and two days later he had got a letter from a man in New York who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion picture business now . He had made Laird a proposition , and Laird had driven to town and talked to the man long distance . " Folks , " Laird had announced when he came home that night , " we 're in business . " Every night Laird and Lolly would drive to a hill town which had no movie house , and put on an outdoor show . The man in New York furnished the film and projector in exchange for a percentage of the profits . They charged fifteen cents admission , and before each show , while Lolly sold candy , Laird did a few tricks and told a few jokes , then handed out prizes which he bought at wholesale from a place in Chicago . They charged fifteen cents for the candy , which cost them three cents a box . In Laurelton , though , they never charged for the Wednesday night shows . That , Laird insisted , was home , and he could n't charge home folks . Of course he would always sell the candy to pay expenses . LVIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the car , as Laird rolled across the new Laurelton bridge and parked in front of Lovell Jenkins ' store . Some children , mostly girls , were playing in the dusty driveway between the store and the Jenkins ' big yellow frame house . The minute they spotted Laird , they stopped playing and ran over to him . " The show man ! " " Trick ! Do us a trick ! " Alvin shuffled into the store , the children clearing an aisle for him , then closing ranks again , swarming around Laird . He pulled two red bandanas out of his pocket , and did his disappearing knot trick . The children , who had seen him do it every show night for six weeks , pressed against him , begging him to do some more tricks , but he told them to wait till tonight . He had some special new tricks for the show tonight . " Loy , " Laird said , shaking off the children like burrs and striding into the store , " you 're a sportin ' man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm gon na drink a cold bottle of lemon sour , and I 'm gon na smoke the best cigar you got in the house , and then I 'm gon na flip a coin , If you call it right , I 'm gon na pay you double , and if you do n't call it , I 'm gon na shake you by the hand and walk on outta here with my money in my pocket . " Alvin was reading from a list , Mrs. Jenkins hobbling about the store , getting the things down from the shelves and putting them together on the counter , " Salt . Sugar . Coffee . . , , " Tails , " Lov said . " Lovell , my friend , " Laird said , bowing , " I thank you . " " Just a minute , " Lov said . " I did n't git to see that coin . " " It come up heads , " Laird said . " But I did n't see it . " " That 's all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of his leg , chuckling . That Laird , he could joke his way to hcll'n back . Alvin , bent forward under the weight of his box of groceries , started toward the car . Out of the corner of his eye he had seen Lovell slip a stick of chocolate ice cream into a sack and give it to Laird . Alvin had spent four dollars and thirty-six cents , and Mrs. Jenkins had n't given him so much as a piece of penny candy for the kids , but Laird not only got his pop and his cigar for nothing , Lovell even threw in a little treat for Lolly . " It 'd make your stomach turn , " Alvin told Maud when he got home with the groceries , " the way the kids all follow him around and everybody falls all over themselves givin ' him treats and . . . " He stopped abruptly , his glance lighting on four huge red tomatoes , freshly washed and laid aside . Maud followed the line of his look , her face coloring , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em , " Maud said . " If Laird 's so fond of ' em , why ca n't Lolly help you tend ' em ? " " She 's got ' er own work to do . " Alvin picked up the four tomatoes , which were so big his hands could hardly hold them . " I 'll take ' ern down for you , " he said , and Maud started to protest , then shrugged and went on with her kitchen work . A HE came near the trailer , he could hear Lolly , and then Laird , followed by a childish chorus of amazement and delight . It sounded like the trailer was filled with kids . He could make out little Alvie 's voice , and he guessed that Maudic and Mattie May were there , too . Alvie had n't swept the porch yet or brought in the wood chips , and the two girls should be helping their mother wash the tomatoes and put them away . Alvin lengthened his stride . One thing he would n't stand for , Laird and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing in the trailer door , her back to him . She had on a red sunsuit , a strip of red across her back with a small red bow ; and her long brown legs bare beneath the short skirt . She turned when she heard him , her yellow hair whipping lightly around her throat . He handed her the tomatoes , not looking at the sunsuit , mumbling , " Maud sent ' em down . " Then he called to Alvie and the two girls . " You all git on up to the house . You got your work to do . " " Uncle Laird 's gon na do his snake trick , " Alvie said . " You finish your work , " Alvin said . " Then we 'll see about tricks . " The trailer swarmed with children , five on the daybed , at least half a dozen scattered over the floor . Alvie started to whine , and Laird , stepping over the heads of the others , soothed him . " Tonight , " Laird said , easing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see all the tricks and a nice show besides . A Mickey Mouse . " Lolly held up the tomatoes for Laird to see . " Are n't they terrific ? " she said , and she told Alvin again to thank Maud for them . " Laird loves fried tomatoes for his breakfast . " A little girl in a striped blue dress got up from the floor . Alvin was n't sure , but when he got to thinking about it afterwards he figured she was one of the Clagett girls . She had the Clagett mouth . " Our'n was bigger , " the little girl said . Lolly flushed . " Yours were nice , too . " " Bigger , " the little girl insisted . " Twicet as big . " As Lolly moved to shush the child , Alvin could see the small white sink at the other end of the trailer . It was piled with tomatoes , and there were fresh peas , beets , roasting ears , even a quart pail of blackberries . " Well , " Alvin said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another time Maud'n me wo n't bother . " " Laird never gets enough fresh tomatoes , " Lolly said . " And ai n't it nice , " Alvin said , " he do n't have to work for ' em . " He grabbed Alvie by the arm and yanked him toward the house , the two girls cowering behind him . " No show for you all tonight , " Alvin ' said , and the children set up such a howl that Maud came bobbing out of the house , breathless . She held court an the steps , and the children got to go to the show , but they had to promise not to go down to Uncle Laird 's trailer any more . Alvin insisted on that . " I catch you all down there again , " Alvin said , " you do n't ever git to go to the show again . You and that ended the argument because they had long ago learned that Daddy was always right , and even when he was n't , they must never let on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper Lolly came up to the house with an armful of magazines . She told Maud to hurry and get dressed for the show , she was going to stay with Mama tonight . Maud protested , but Lolly just smiled and shut her out of Mama 's room . Maud , curious to see what kind of a show Laird put on , slipped into her next-to-best dress , a holly print , and rode up to Laurelton in Laird 's car , sitting between Laird and Alvin , the children in the rumble seat . She was surprised to find how excited she was , like the children . " If it was prayer meetin ' , " Alvin said after Laird had parked the car and taken the projector into Lov Jenkins ' store , " I wonder how many of ' em would be hurryin ' so fast to git here ? " Maud shook her head . She could see the cars , packed with children , tumbling down the hill roads , bouncing over ruts hidden by the thickening dust . Parking in the schoolyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the families filed across the new cement bridge and down the narrow dirt driveway to the sprawling , unkempt yard behind the Jenkins ' store . The children ran ahead , eager to get close to the open truck where the show man did his tricks , The older people kept to the back of the yard , talking primaries and hay-making , poking envious fun at the men who had thought to bring pillows or camp stools . Laird set up his projector in the back of the store , training it on the portable screen already put up in the yard , then Loy Jenkins helped him run a light through the back door out to the truck , which was parked on the creek side of the yard . It was a large open flatbed truck , with sapling poles sticking up on each side . Some of the prizes , the scarves and dish towels and pan holders , were hanging on the poles , while others were scattered over the shelf of overturned crates . The bright red , green , and yellow of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dark wall of trees along the creek . Alvin edged off from the crowd , leaving Maud laughing and gossiping with a flock of women . He saw Laird stride out of the back door , glance quickly at the screen , the crowd , the truck . Laird 's face was drawn tight with worry , and for a moment Alvin felt that maybe Laird was taking Mama 's sickness harder than he let on . " All right , folks . " Laird had climbed up on the truck , and , beaming , he began to wave his arms , quieting the crowd . He singled out a talkative man in a blue shirt with red armbands . " Ah , " he said , " if you want to entertain the folks , why do n't you come up here ? " The crowd tittered , the man reddened and slunk out of sight . " Well , Nvell , " Laird said , " I see we got sportin ' men in the crowd tonight , and I tell you what I 'm gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody likes somepun different once'n a while , so tonight I 'm gon na pass among you with some boxes , and I 'm gon na tell you beforehand there ai n't a thing in them boxes , no sir , they 're just as empty as my head , and you know thas plenty empty . I 'm gon na hand out these empty boxes , and you 're gon na pay me fifteen cents , and then you 're gon na tear off the bottom of the box and write your name on it . I 'm gon na put the names in a hat , not my hat , mind you , I got a brand new hat , but I 'll take old Charley Mauck 's hat here , and I 'm gon na put all the names in it , and here 's some of the prizes you winners are gon na draw tonight . " He reached behind him and got a white dish towel with a red border . He held it up to his waist , frowning , as though not sure what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to laugh , and Laird turned to her . " Thas right , Mrs. Sowers . This here 's a dish towel . I knowed what it was . I just wanted to see if you knowed . Then we got this pretty glass frame . You can put your pitcher in it , or if you never had yourpitcher took , you can put your army discharge papers in it , or if you never was in the Army , you can put your marriage license in it , or if you never was married , you can put your birth certificate in it , or if you never was born , you can . . . . Well , next we got these red bandanas . Used to sell ' em for ten cents for men 's handkerchiefs , but then the ladies got to tyin " em around their heads for show , so now they call ' em bandanas and they ask fifty-nine cents for ' cm . Just goes to show you what happens when the ladies make a show of somepun . Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " Mrs. Sowers , who had known Laird since he was a crawling baby , began to laugh again . Every week Laird said the grand prize was something special , and of course it was always another factory-made Indian blanket . Laird stopped , stared straight at Mrs. Sowers , pretending great annoyance . The crowd got ready to laugh . Old Laird was going to let her have it . " I reckon you think you know what the grand prize is , " Laird said , and Mrs. Sowers said sure , it was one of them old Indian blankets . " Now thas just where you 're wrong , " Laird said , and he turned back to the crowd . " You see , folks , thas what comes of bein ' too smart for your own good . Our friend here thinks she knows what the grand prize is , so she ai n't holdin ' her breath waitin ' like the rest of you . Oh no , she 's too smart . Well , this is where she Bits the surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I told you it was somepun special ? the grand prize is a genuine imported lap robe for your car . " Laird held up the Indian blanket , and the crowd roared its delight . Old Laird had done it again . N ow remember , folks , " Laird said , waving a box of candy over his head , " these here 're just empty boxes I 'm sellin ' tonight . " The children eyed the familiar box , pricked by a little stab of worry . Maybe the boxes really were empty . But , no , it was just the show man fooling again . " - Who 's gon na be the first sport to step up and give me fifteen cents for an empty box ? " Soley Sowers nudged Burr Rivercomb , and Burr held up his hand . " Well , " Laird said , handing a box to Burr , " we got one sport anyway . " Then the others began to crowd around the truck , mostly children , the grown-ups giving them the money , figuring they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything for the show . They knew exactly what was in the boxes , two gumdrops , a hoarhound drop , a licorice whip , and some little prize , a whistle , a package of preserving jar labels , a balloon , or a couple of marbles . The children tore open the boxes , dug for their surprise , then gobbled the candy and traded prizes . The older children wrote the names on the label and put them in the hat . Most of the grown-ups could n't read or write . " Now , folks , " Laird said when the candy sales began to taper off , " tonight I got a li'l surprise for you . You all been comin ' here to the shows , and you seen me do my tricks . Well , tonight I 'm gon na show you one of the tricks of die trade , gon na show you how to do that knot trick . It 's fun to be fooled , friends , but it 's more fun to know , and once you git the hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laird motioned the little Slater boy to climb up on the truck . The child 's obvious fright appealed to the crowd . They began to clap reassuringly . Laird rumpled the boy 's red hair . " Gon na make a show man outta this boy , " Laird said , then he held up two red bandanas , one in each hand . " All right now , folks , here 's the way you do it . You tie the bandanas together in a square knot , the tighter the better . " Laird tugged at the knot , drawing it tight , then holding it up for the crowd to see . " Once you git your knot good'n tight , you cover it up like this . Fold this end up'n over , and then this end , so now you ca n't see the knot , but you know it 's there under them two folded ends . How about it , son ? Is the knot still there ? " The Slater boy reached up and took hold of the knot . He nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , then he motioned the boy to take hold of the knotted bandanas . " Now here 's the part you watch close , " Laird said . He placed his flattenedhands about six inches above the bandanas which the Slater boy was holding , then he closed his eyes and began to spout a quick , solemn gibberish . " Abacadabra , rootenscootenhooten , sisboombah . You hear that , everybody ? Abacadabra , rootenscootenhooten , sisboombah . All right now , let 's see if the knot 's still there . " Laird reached down and took the two bandanas from the boy 's hand . They were untied . He held them up , one in each hand . " Thas all there is to it , folks . Just say the right words . Now you can all go home and fool your friends . " The crowd , taken in by the fast patter , caught on to the joke . They chuckled , shook their heads . That Laird . " Lolly said he was havin ' a cartoon pitcher tonight , " Maud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on the running board of Laird 's car , bent forward , staring at the white screen , a strange shine of excitement in her eyes . " And a singin ' cowboy , " Maud said . TAiRo had the Slater boy shuffle all the I4 names in the hat , then draw the prizewinners . Mrs. Compson won a jar with a fancy glass stopper , and the crowd howled when Laird slyly told her she could keep her elderberry wine in it . Everybody knew how Serena Compson felt about wine . Maud was the last winner . Giggling , she went up to the truck and Laird gave her two red bandanas . " Now you can chi the knot trick , " Laird said . " Just remember the magic words . " Maud , pleased and embarrassed , went back to the running board and sat down . She gave the bandanas to Alvin . He hurriedly stuffed them in his pocket , upset by all the attention the prize had drawn m Maud and himself . " Now , folks , " Laird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just settle back in your big easy chairs and enjoy the show . " Darkness had settled slowly over the hills which rimmed the town like the sides of a broken blue saucer , the creek marking the break . Gnats swarmed across the lighted window , and the children , talking in whispers , kept their eyes on the screen , not wanting to miss the start of the picture . A cool breeze stirred the leaves of the sycamores along the creek , and the men leaning against the mottled trunks stared across the vast width of darkness which ended at Hogback Mountain . Above them the stars were like a great scattering of salt crystals ' on a blue cloth . Suddenly the children began to squeal happily , to whistle and clap their hands , then as suddenly they hushed . The picture show had started . A TERWARDS , lying beside Alvin in the brass bed , Maud closed her eyes , and she could see the whole show again , the cartoon picture , the singing cowboy , even the crazy white flashes when Laird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught in the wire coil , and the big stupid dog backed into an open fire , then jumped and hit his head against the door , and the cowboy sang so loud they must have heard him dawn at the lime kiln , but it was pretty to listen ta , and they made a nice couple , him and the girl . Maud drowsed off , and the singing played in her mind like Laird 's phonograph music . When she woke up , she did n't know how many minutes or hours later , she was startled , she sensed at once that Alvin was n't in the bed . " Alvin ? " She saw him standing by the window in his cotton nightshirt . " You sick ? " " No . " His body jerked , like a colt shying . " I He you anything ? " He stood with his back toward her , his hands hidden . " No . I 'm all right . " He was edgy , a sting in his voice . She lay back in the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long while , he was uncertain , he fumbled , and he still did n't look at her . " I 've tried . I 've always tried to do what was right . Ai n't I , Maud ? " " Why , Alvin , of course you have . " " I 've done a lot for people ' round here . They 'd still be usin ' coal oil lamps if I had n't gone to the Senator and got the ' lectric lights put in out here , and the same with the phones and the government trees . " " Sure , everybody knows that , and they ' preciate it . " " Nobody 's ever said so . They 've never even said thank you . But Laird , Laird comes back and tells ' em a joke and shows ' em a picture , and they just ca n't do enough for ' im . Even my own kids , they hang ' round that trailer like it was a candy counter . " " It 's the tricks and the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Even Mama , " he said , speaking into the pale square of window light . " We 've made ' er a home , we work the place and pay the bills , but when she 's bad off , does she ever ask for us ? No , it 's Laird'n Lolly . It 's always Laird'n Lolly . " She fluffed up his pillow and smoothed the rumpled sheets on his side of the bed . " You come on back to the bed . You 're tired . " " Everything I 've ever wanted or worked for , " he said , " I 've never quite got it , but always it 's come to Laird , just handed to ' im , and he 's turned his back on it . Why , Maud ? Why ? " The room was quiet , with no sound except the idiot screech of the trccfrogs . " I ai n't sure of things any more , " he said . " I used to be , but not now . I just ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his face was haggard and tormented , she saw for the first time that he was holding the two bandanas she had won at the show , and she knew what had awakened her , the sound of his clumsy tugging at the knot trick Laird did so easily .
