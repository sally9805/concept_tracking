As dusk fell in Vichy a solitary figure could be seen walking along the banks of the Allier River evidently in deep thought , hands behind his back . But few recognized General Maxime Weygand , who tonight is still Delegate-General of the Government for French Africa with full powers to act on his own initiative in cases of emergency . Those who did bared their heads , sensing that the slight man , still athletic despite his 74 years , was engaging in a deep moral struggle . <P> Some recalled that at the end of May last year they had bared their heads when that same figure emerged from the Ministry of War in Paris , summoned post-haste from the Near East to take command of the French armies in a forlorn hope . <P> Late tonight it seems likely that General Weygand will not return to his headquarters in Algiers . . . . <P> Though New York Times Correspondent G. H. Archambault did not know it when he wrote this understanding dispatch , General Weygand had already made his decision . For 14 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adolf Hitler 's war plans and New Order in Europe . Time after time he had said he would fight anybody who tried to take French North Africa . Time after time Adolf Hitler had tried to have him removed . But on this point old Marshal Henri Philippe Ptain had been firm-until the pressure became too great . Now General Weygand had been told that collaboration with Hitler would entail concessions in North Africa . Only one decision was possible for such a man as Maxime Weygand . Correspondent Archambault told what sort of man this was : <P> General Weygand 's retirement would add one more chapter to a life story that in the last 20 years has consisted mostly of recalls from retirement during crises-the defense of Warsaw against the Bolsheviki in 1020 , when women kissed the hem of his garment and men hailed him as a savior ; Chief of the French General Staff when the full implication of a reduction of the length of compulsory military service had become clear ; and finally to take chief command when the Germans had won the Battle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See Weygand , " was Marshal Foch 's reply to intruders and bores , and General Weygand , his Chief of Staff , was ever equal to the occasion . It is a matter of record that General Weygand was prepared to sacrifice promotion and all else in his loyalty to Marshal Foch . . . . <P> Maxime Weygand had pledged his word to one policy , and sealed it by accepting U.S. aid . He had pledged his loyalty to a chief who had now chosen another policy . General Weygand was , above all , a soldier whose first loyalty was to his chief-whether that chief was the indomitable Foch or the plastic Ptain . Maxime Weygand resigned .
