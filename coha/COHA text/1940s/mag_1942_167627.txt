AMERICA 'S STRATEGY IN WORLD POLITICS-Nicholas John Spykman-Harcourf , Brace ( $3.75 ) . <P> Long before Pearl Harbor , Professor Nicholas John Spykman glanced up one day from his studies of German Geopoliticians Friedrich Ratzel and Karl Haushofer to observe that , if he looked at the globe one way , the New World encircled the Old . But if he looked at the globe another way-if , for example , Germany had upset the balance of power in Europe , or Japan upset the balance of power in Asia , and these two powers joined forces-the Old World encircled the New . In this geopolitical embrace , the New World might suffer a " caress of death . " So he wrote this provocative and controversial book to tell his compatriots why they must be ready at all times to fight to preserve the balance of power in Europe and Asia . <P> A geopolitician , Professor Spykman wrote with the colossal calm of the new fatalism in which geography is destiny . A Dutchman ( he was naturalized in 1928 ) , he viewed destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for generations below sea level . A professor of international relations at Yale , he thought with the cold-bloodedness of a historian who knows that nations come &; go , but that the human race goes on . <P> What he had to say was this : due to its position as a continental island between Asia and Europe , the survival of the U.S. has always depended , and always will depend , on maintaining a balance of power in Europe and Asia . Whenever that balance is seriously unbalanced , the U.S. must fight . Also , due to the U.S. geographic position , there have always been two opposed geopolitical theories as to where and when to fight . One theory is interventionism , which maintains that the fight must be fought in Asia and Europe , with the help of European and Asiatic allies . The other theory is isolationism , which maintains that the U.S. can retire behind its oceans and fight off all aggressors with the help of its hemispheric allies ( Latin America ) . The question for Americans : Shall the U.S. dominate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan ? <P> Survival . Whatever else the U.S. may be fighting for in World War II it is fighting first &; foremost , Author Spykman insists , for its political life . He thinks Americans ought to be a little clearer about the meaning of power . " In this kind of a world states can only survive by constant devotion to power politics . . . . The struggle for power is identical with the struggle for survival . . . . All else is secondary , because in the last instance only power can achieve the objectives of foreign policy . " <P> In two lines Spykman condenses the viewpoint about which German geopoliticians have written volumes : " Geography is the most fundamental factor in the foreign policy of states because it is the most permanent . Ministers come and ministers go , even dictators die , but mountain ranges stand unperturbed . " Out of this idea the Germans have made their fashionable theory of geopolitics , and the Nazis have made history .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
