The dreary , ever-pressing shortages of strategic materials pose one of the most troublesome problems of the U.S. air arm : the need of spacious , speedy transport units to move personnel and equipment to combat areas . Last week Curtiss-Wright Corp . had a new answer on the drawing board : a mammoth transport plane , perhaps the world 's largest of its type , made mainly of plywood and plastics . <P> Said Curtiss-Wright : the plane will have " the speed required by modern warfare and will be constructed largely of wood and materials not included in the list of military priorities . " Production will begin as soon as a new factory , site undisclosed , is completed . <P> Air veterans recalled World War I 's old flying " Jennies " ( the JN types , fabric-covered , wooden cratelike structures ) , the wooden Lockheeds ( the type Wiley Post flew around the world ) and Fokker commercial planes of more than ten years ago . They had high praise for planes mainly built of wood on grounds of greater maneuverability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains that it is not yet ready for wooden combat planes , is meanwhile ordering more &; more wooden primary trainers , has available a design for an advanced trainer in which priority precious metals may be replaced by wood and low-alloy steel . <P> But the Jenny 's transport successor has one clinching , convincing argument in her own right : she can be turned out in a fraction of the time and for a fraction of the cost of an aluminum plane , not to mention a total saving of aluminum .
