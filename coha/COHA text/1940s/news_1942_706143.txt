txt Organizations Buy Defense Bonds In connection with the letter of N. J. Cassavetes , it may be of interest at this time that on Nov. 17 at a joint Bill of Rights meeting held by the Hungarian Literary Society , the Hungarian Young Folks Circle and the Hungarian National Democratic Club , upon a spontaneous suggestion of one of the members , organized defense bond buying was formally set in motion among associations of Hungarian-born Americans ; for example , the directors of the Hungarian Relief Society decided to liquidate all their holdings for investment in defense bonds . Thus all told over $50,000 worth of bonds are accounted for and that is only the beginning . Such action is not merely a patriotic gesture assuring a safe investment of trust funds , but a sincere token of the unswerving devotion and eagerness to serve on the part of Americans of Hungarian stock in grateful appreciation for the blessings of the American way of life which they and their children still enjoy in this beloved country of ours . ?
