txt Abroad The United States Is Not Expected to " Do It All " By ANNE O'HARE McCORMICK The arguments against the Stratton bill for the admission of 400,000 displaced persons from Europe in the next four years seem based on the idea that the United States alone is asked to give homes to these homeless people . In a recent debate Omar B. Ketchum , of the Veterans of Foreign Wars , asserted that the DPs should go back and help build up ' their own countrie ? g , but most opponents of the measure know that the tragedy of the displaced is that they have either lost their countries , like the citizens of the Baltic states , or are unwilling or afraid to return to Soviet-dominated lands . The 1 more usual question is the one raised in Congress : Why should America be the haven for these refugees ? Why do n't other countries take them in ? In various forms this is the question Americans are always asking . ? They did not ask it when the country was younger and weaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich that the whole world leans on it they think fearfully of the limits of its power and resources . Even now the hardest thing for Americans to realize is that they are irrevocably where they are , the key factor in every problem . We I are discovering that power is not independence ; it has to bear the weight of too many dependents . It is not free to act or hot to act ; it is bound by too many obligations , not merely to others but to itself . Not the Hardest Problem Not many problems are as easy and manageable as finding homes for less than a million displaced persons . They are , in fact , only a small fraction of the millions displaced in Europe by mass migrations and deportations . But these immense human uprootings and upheavals are part of the larger problem of pacification and reconstruction envisaged in the Marshall proposal . The DPs we are asked to make room for are the immediate responsibility of the Western Allies . It costs the American treasury more to support them in camps abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could support themselves . The fact is that while we are arguing the question the British have been quietly admitting DPs at an accelerating rate in an effort to overcome the manpower shortage and increase production . It is officially reported that they are at present migrating into England at the rate of 4,000 a week . This is in addition to 120,000 Poles settling in Britain as the Polish army is disbanded . It does not include the 100,000 Estonians , Latvians and Lithuanians which the Ecumenical Refugee Commission , acting for British churches , is planning to bring in during the year beginning Sept. 1 . France and Belgium are also taking their share , but the migration to England is better organized and on a bigger . scale . With the consent of the trade unions , these potential workers are being " induced " to go to England by guarantees that they will be paid the same wages and employed under the same conditions as British workers . In a country on strict rations , with a housing shortage much greater than that of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DPs as an asset . It also proves the fallacy of opposition to the Stratton bill on the ground that the whole burden of settling the DPs will fall on us . This is not without its bearing on the larger questions that come to the fore in the widening discussion launched by Secretary Marshall when he asked the nations of Europe to agree on a plan for European recovery , and thereby dropped a stone into an apparently stagnant pool that has set the waters eddying in all directions . At least they move ; more and more one senses the relief of governments in having something fresh to talk about , in looking at their monotonous problems from another and broader aspect . If anything at all comes of the thought of unified action that begins to sprout as they speak of coal , for instance , as European instead of German , Polish , French or British coal , the plowed-up ground is ready for the new seed . The one thing that can be said with some certainty of postwar Europe is that people in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries , more confining now than ever before . Alternative to Nightmare But anyone who listens carefully to the European discussion must be struck by two points . One is the welcome given by European governments , particularly the British , to the idea of doing something on their own , even if it is only preparing a balance sheet for the United States of their assets and liabilities . Russia is likely to come in somewhere , but the British and the French are determined to proceed in any case ; and while the difficulties in the way are staggering  --  The Sunday . Observer of London proposes a central development agency for a rehabilitation program that will cost $25,000 , - 000,000  --  the enterprise will be attempted , if only , as The Observer remarks , because the alternative to this " dream " is the " reality of the present nightmare . " The second point is that all the governments share the same misgivings lest American aid will mean deflection from the socializing programs they have set for themselves . They can not recover without our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet orbit , and yet those still outside desire to do as much as possible for themselves in order to retain a maxi --  ' mum of independeniee . The last thing Europe wants , in other words , is that the United States should " do it alL "
