Sixteen years ago a handsome young Episcopal rector of Christ Church , Macon , Ga. , heard that his name was up for nomination to the Bishopric of Florida . He withdrew his name , protesting that he was " much too young . " Thirteen years later , Oliver James Hart III , now rector of St. John 's ( " The Church of the Presidents " ) in Washington , D. C. , again declined , this time to become Bishop Coadjutor of Tennessee . In the next 16 months he turned down two more bishoprics : the Dioceses of Central New York and Delaware . <P> Last week President Roosevelt wrote a letter regretting that Dr. Hart had accepted an offer . This one was from Boston 's big , swank Trinity Church ( salary : $15,000 ; communicants : 2,400 ) , to be vacated this fall by another Southern aristocrat , Rev. Arthur Lee ( " Little Tui " ) Kinsolving , who leaves for modest little Trinity Church at Princeton , N. J. Boston should give Rector Hart another chance to refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tui " Kinsolving ( who did not stay long enough ) , Trinity 's three rectors each became a bishop . <P> No political parson , Dr. Hart is noted for confining himself to the personal , spiritual needs of his parish . World War II , Term III , Column V , find no place in his sermons . Says he : " There is so little time to bring the comfort and guidance of religion into the daily lives of my congregation . . . it can not be done if one 's theme is political . "
