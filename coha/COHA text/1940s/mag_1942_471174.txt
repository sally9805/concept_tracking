THERE is always the danger in wartime of making an enemy more mys-terious than he is . As a war goes along , as the wall between you and the enemy grows higher and heavier , everything on the other side of that wall gets to be a mystery . To make too much of the mystery is a danger . But it is also a danger , I think an even greater one , not to remember daily , hourly , in all the sudden and varying perplexities of war , that the psychology of your enemy may be as important to know as his factories and fortifications . The Japanese mind is a dark corner . Interpreter after interpreter is saying that quick victory depends on outsmarting that mind . And lasting peace no doubt will depend for a long period on outthinking it . I happened to reach Japan for my first visit on the July day the American Exclusion Act went into effect . The Japanese resented the Exclusion Act , said it insulted them . That whole visit was under a strain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or see as many significant moments . Recently I have been trying to piece together those moments , with the following result . Their Sense of Humor Most commentators are agreed that the Japanese have no sense of humor . Possibly . But an appetite for a practical joke they do have , and that is a mental quality worth examining , because practical joking and cruelty are close , an itch for the one usually carrying along a streak of the other . Practical joking is an interest in upset , and when that interest gets high enough it induces the upset , and that is cruelty . Cruelty makes war easier . I had been advised to bring certain foods , had fitted the bottom of one of my trunks with a row of cans containing flour , sugar , coffee , salt , allspice , and above the cans had hung two hams and a bacon . A committee of doctors met me at the pier , assured me that I need not bother to go through the customs with the trunks , that they would arrive safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed with the flour , the sugar with the coffee , everything spilled out , thrown together , neatly poured back . I swallowed the explanation that some idiot customs officer had not known one Occidental food from another . But when my hams and bacon , hung under the eaves of a Tokyo house to keep them cool , were represented after a few hours by three strings with pieces of skin attached , and it was explained that hungry dogs had come and eaten the meat , I knew the doctors lied . Nevertheless , it took me till December 7th , another seventeen years , to realize that the hams and bacon had been hung low ? carried deliberately to the low side of the house ? to make what was going to happen to them seem credible . It was a practical joke on an American on a day when you were not particularly liking Americans , and the whole thing was planned in detail like a piece of strategy . I remembered my hams and bacon when I saw the press pictures of Kurusu and Nomura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Secretary Hull , was quite certain that I could see in their faces the tremendous satisfaction , not only in the way they had succeeded , but in the historic practical joke they had played . Used to Disaster I mean in what follows to emphasize our disadvantages , and I do that deliberately . We know our advantages . We do not need the comfort of having them repeated to us . What we lacked six months ago was a full recognition of our danger . We have that now . We shall shorten the war just in so far as we do not get discouraged , but keep looking at the debit side of our ledger , material , moral , mental . From the pier on that July morning I went by ricksha ? an American invention ? to the automobile that took me the twenty-five miles from Yokohama to Tokyo . This was in 1924 ? exactly ten months to the day after the great earthquake . Thousands of lives had been lost , billions of yen in property values destroyed . It was a sunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had my first look at the Japanese house . We all know the style , yet donot fully realize how simple a structure it is . In metropolitan areas many houses are now two-storeyed , entirely wood , sometimes with a frosting of stucco . The more typical house , however , is one-storeyed , no foundation , no solid walls . By night rough slides of board are drawn around . The partitions between the rooms are portable several rooms within a minute made into one ? and constructed largely of opaque paper . The floors also are portable , straw mats fitted into six-by-three wood frames . To us the house is the mere skeleton of a house . Rice paper still serves widely for glass panes . In the country when the weather is warm the rooms may stand open all day , and even near to a big city you continue to see thatched roofs , though most now are tile . On that morning the reason for that simple structure seemed obvious to me . Earthquake is always striking somewhere in the islands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year . Rough seas leave their wake . The Japanese must be able to replace his house rapidly , must expect to do it repeatedly , must not be overwhelmed by the cost . His long experience in this direction ought now to be of value to him . It is my opinion that he may not be too easily discouraged as we substitute bombs for typhoons , that natural calamity may have prepared him for the dreary repetition of bombing . I was in a village , sitting in the dim light of a house , when the Buddhist temple gong boomed . After an interval it boomed again and again and again . I got up , walked into the street . That street was so narrow you and your neighbor could have shaken hands without either of you stepping off your floor . In the Tokyo area such a street is called a lane ? we should call it an alley , and a dirty alley because on one side runs the trench of an open sewer , and your neighbors ' offal idles past you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazing toward the left , where a few miles away smoke was rising . A fire . Presently here or there a man went into his house , came out with a bucket , walked off in the direction of the smoke . The gong boomed all afternoon . Then the refugees began corning in , carrying rice bowls , sake cups , sticks of bamboo , boards of bamboo , much of this on their backs , and clogs , kimonos , straw mats , wooden pails . Then a man spoke to me ? in that utterly expressionless way they often speak . " Twenty houses burned down . We were lucky . If the wind had been the other way it would have been two hundred . " his was one of the twenty . Another time I came to a village late at night . It had been raining three days . 1 reached the house I was to occupy about eleven o'clock , was put up into the loft to sleep . At two in the morning I was awakened by voices . " O-miya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flood was rising in the room , and the family was literally taking the house apart . Walls , partitions , fluor , all were tucked up into the loft where I had been sleeping . The skeleton of the house stood there in the dark and the waters . Next morning by ten the flood had risen to within eleven inches of the loft , where I and fourteen Japanese were huddled . The old woman did most of the talking . This also seemed with complete absence of emotion ; she just dropped her remarks around her . " Last year the water came to within fifteen inches of the loft . . . In 1921 it came to within nine inches . . . In 1904 it was five inches At three inches the house floats . . . . " My interest was emphatically in when the house would float and where it would float to , but that , judging by the faces , was my interest alone . A dead body from a new grave went by . A young man swam by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once caught in that you would be as trapped as a rat . Next day the waters subsided , and , kimonos wrapped up round hips , men and women , the whole population , went to work in the mud . For fifty thousand yen , the price of a few rice fields , the village could permanently divert the waters , but even to talk of that was regarded as ridiculous self-indulgence . Indifference to Death We reached Tokyo about noon . The doctors dropped me at the Imperial Hotel ? the only truly great modern structure in Asia , and built by an American , Frank Lloyd Wright . Presently one of the doctors came into my room , informed me that an unknown Japanese had cut down the American flag on the Embassy grounds . Later another informed me that six Japanese had committed hara-kiri in protest against the Exclusion Act , and that their bodies had been left on the sidewalk in front of the Embassy . That was a lie . But by that time on that morning I was ready to believe a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed considerable even to my early romantic ideas of Japanese self-sacrifice . We Occidentals do not find it easy to die . We can get ourselves willing and ready by thinking it over , but we do not take to it pleasantly . We are more influenced by modern science , not fully assured of our immortality . Furthermore , we are less directly in touch with death . We have fewer deaths , as fewer births , are less violent by nature . Our social arrangements , our hospitals , even our undertakers hide death away from our sight , make it a less familiar experience . And we certainly do not contemplate suicide with any excited interest . The Japanese does . It is an insistent characteristic of his mind . The following happened often : a Japanese doctor would be showing me the countryside , he and I would come on a waterfall and I would involuntarily start to admire it and would be stopped by his remark , " What a place to drop down ! " I know of course that classic hara-kiri is not common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He likes to read of it in the newspapers . He likes to see it on the stage . In the village theaters you are never able to avoid it . Charles Royer did it quite correctly for us on the screen . The white cloth of death is spread on the straw-matted floor . The hero settles in the middle . His second helps him off with his outer dark kimono , reveals him to have under it a white one , the kimono of death . The second passes him an object wrapped in white . The hero unwraps the object , a polished dagger , the dagger of death . The second helps him to open his kimono and bare his abdomen . He dismisses the second . He leans on the dagger like a surgeon , is careful to cut where there are few blood vessels , the idea being that he must not bleed too profusely and die too rapidly . Once into the abdomen he rips the dagger up and down , and were his enemy at that moment to appear , he would slice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his enemy 's face . That all is correct form , as every Japanese schoolboy could tell you . The great case of modern times is the well-known one of General Nogi , worth repeating again because it has been a powerful example , and will be the prod to the reckless act of many an otherwise ordinary Japanese soldier . The General was the commander at Port Arthur in the Japanese-Russian War . He was victorious , but the newspapers said he lost too many men , so he offered to commit hara-kiri . The Emperor forbade him ? the old Emperor , grandfather of Hirohito . General Nogi waited till the Emperor died , and on the day of the burial , while all over Japan the gongs were booming and the body was being carried up the temple steps , the General cut open his abdomen , followed his Emperor into the grave . And General Nogi 's wife followed him . They were all of them going back to their ancestors , and that is a satisfaction to them . They Can Sleep on Their Heels I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken by closed ricksha to a mammoth meeting in Yeno Park , a protest against the Exclusion Act , thousands standing silent in black dress kimono , disagreeably impressive . And from Yeno Park I was taken back to the hotel . It had been decided that I should leave Tokyo for a few weeks , return when the feeling had blown over ; so I started south by a midnight train . I think it was 2 A.M. when we got to Numazu , a junction at the base of Fuji , where Hirohito has one of his summer houses . I stepped from the train toward the waiting room , and , almost literally , dropped back . A small-town waiting room . Every square foot of it was covered with Japanese , tucked in , side to side , buttocks on heels , a little sea of them ? sleeping ! I counted them . One hundred and ninety-six . That hot crowded roomful of them , sleeping . I was often later to lie awake with sleeping Japanese round me , envy how still their bodies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe , let the bowl rest on his hairy chest while he slept , no fear it would roll off and set fire to the straw floor . If there were anything I could at this moment give to my countrymen , besides more machinery for war , it would be just this capacity to sleep restfully whenever and however they had to . In that waiting room at Numazu the sleeping mothers had their sleeping babies tied to their backs . A Declaration of War in 1924 I rode all that night , the next day , the next night ? Japanese faces , Japanese farmers , Japanese factories , Japanese cemeteries ? toward evening came down into the southern tip of the southern island , the ken of Takamori Saigo . Locally they tell you that it was that thick-necked hero all by himself who started the revolution that put the Mikados back in power . Then , finally , at about dark the train slid into the city of Kagoshima . A Kagoshima doctor took me as his house guest . Outside his bamboo fence he stationed two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Fourth of July , stifling . The policemen wore white uniforms and had small daggers on their hips . The doctor watched not only over my life but over my stomach , for he fed me the first food I had relished since I had left the ship , sukiyaki ? this Japanese stew is also an American invention , much fed to Americans as publicity . I had there that evening my first experience of eating squatting on a straw-matted floor . No Japanese sits with grace but they squat expertly . The doctor was a Shintoist . The Shintoists look different , more boiling , more dangerous , more self-contained . Shinto is the native religion , the worship of ancestors . Hirohito is a Shintoist . All with strong national feeling are . The one opposite me had a powerful body , head cropped so close it looked naked . From where he squatted he said to me , quietly and point-blank , at this our first friendly supper , that he wished his country would immediately wipe off the insult , declare war on mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a light wind . It was somehow an unreal remark that evening . Later we went to visit a museum halfway up a hill at the side of the town , dedicated to the thick-necked Takamori Saigo , and there among objects all Japanese , suddenly a violently contrasting photograph , signed : " To the Museum of the Hero of Kagoshima with Profound Admiration ? Mussolini . " The Family Unit The next fourteen days I passed in a country house on a mountain . The mountain was called Kirishima , meaning " island in fog . " And well named . Only once did the fog break . This was late at night , the curtains drew apart , and far out at sea were the lanterns of a hundred fishing boats . I mention this because it stays with me , reminds me what a long fourteen days it was , and convinces me of what an anger was over the whole of Japan , keeping me in a state to notice everything . But what I would like to point to on that mountain is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on vacation . There were children in the house , though I hardly noticed them . A good way to see how Japanese children behave is to compare them with Japanese-American children visiting Japan for the first time . The JapaneseAmericans are so " bad " and free , the Japanese so " good " and suppressed . The disciplining is inconspicuous . One of the children , the littlest , would emit a cry of pain , a thin high-pitched tone , that the child itself immediately softpedaled . I heard the cry , looked quickly , saw nothing . Then , about the third day , I caught the mother as she reached suddenly sidewise , pinched the child in the buttocks , and brought back her hand so fast it seemed on a spring . This was punishment for some small disobedience . After that I caught the mother often , but she appeared not to notice me . A number of times I have heard it carefully described how if a child is especially bad a bit of dry weed is rolled into a cone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set fire to . That mother was remarkably softlooking in that fog-soaked house . She wore a drooping edgeless kimono . There was never a new expression on her face . She had a languid way of moving . Nights when the mosquitoes came in ? and they came by billions on a July night ? she would set to work , noiselessly pitch the mosquito-net tent that was as big as the room , light the incense that stood here and there in porcelain burners , and , her work done , drop Iike a heap of silk to the straw-matted floor and fish mosquitoes out of the air . That last was a curious performance . She would reach , with unfailing skill catch the mosquito between the tips of her pointed long fingers , then push it down into the red-hot charcoal where the men lighted their pipes . Mosquito after mosquito , night after night , always that skillful silent movement , and every mosquito executed singly . The woman was a daughter-in-law , therefore spoke little . In the intervals between mosquitocatching she kept busy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter worked from early morning till late into the night , in a kitchen that had an earth floor with a well in it , prepared the rice , the raw fish , the eternal tea . She was also the one would murmur thanks at the beginning of a meal , murmur thanks at the end ; but the meal itself was eaten in silence , or nearly . Next were the men , hairy , middleaged . Many hours of the day and night they played a game , an ordinary game rendered extraordinary by the quiet . The first made a move , the second made a move , the third made a move . Gambling in quiet is like drinking whiskey alone . Then there was the grandmother . It was she did most of the talking , as in that other house the day of the flood . I have often thought that if I had to be anyone in Japan I should prefer to be an old woman ; for the old women have the power ? iron hand over the wives of the sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for advice on the smallest matters , the whole village coming for advice . This one looked and walked like a wrinkled queen . What an unrelenting pyramid such a family is . The disciplined children below . Over them the dominant mother . Over the mother the husband ? son of the house . Over the sons the dominant grandmother . And over the millions of such pyramids the Emperor , whom every Japanese knows to be divine . This is mentioned in a tone as matter-of-fact as you use in speaking of a date on your calendar . What material for a fanatic nationalism . What material for an army . Obedience is an instinct . Submission is nature . Death is half desirable . And all of this backed by centuries of isolation . I am not one of those who think the long feudal background of Japan is its weakness . I think it is its strength , and by far our greatest problem . I think that new Japan to-day is spending what old Japan saved . I also do not think that the Japanesepeople are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc as powerful as they are because they are close to the individual citizen , and to the Emperor . It would be harder in Japan to cut between rulers and people than in any other country in the world . To attempt that kind of propaganda is a waste of time , which we do not have to spare . Emperor , military leaders , and people will rise or go down to defeat together . Even the most pacific Japanese has always seemed to me not far from the attacking center of his nation . For that reason also the common people of Japan seem to me more responsible for what happens than the common people of other countries . All this we had better take fully into our calculations . Wives Stay at Home From the mountain I went to address a meeting of doctors . The meeting was in a geisha house . Reporters say that the geisha system has been on the decline in the past few years , but that can only mean that the Japanese were denying themselves expensive pleasure in favor of preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diluting it with more potato . The geisha system supplements the family system . It is a union of the males of the nation by still another bond . It is closely knit , closely controlled . There are high geisha houses , there are low geisha houses , but they are all essentially the same , like nothing else on this earth , cementing into one the whole male recreation life of the nation . They are the place of hot talk stimulated by flirtation , of the preparation for hot deeds . They may make the male more male , may make him coarser , more vigorous , freer of his home , more swashbuckling , and they certainly make the Japanese mind more devious for us to understand . Business men transact business in a geisha house . In a town you meet there the doctor , the mayor , the Buddhist priest . Prince Ito wrote the constitution of Japan in the house ( some say , in the lap ) of a geisha . The Japanese takes his foreign guest to a geisha house . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see his wife . She may come a moment into the open space outside the room and bow several times , and you and the man not necessarily pay any attention to her . She will hardly eat with you . The family life of a man is one thing , his social life another . There are no man-woman parties . There could be no fathers ' night at a P.T.A . But a man may also spend the evening in a geisha house by himself , squat in a small partitioned room , the geisha come and go or squat across from him and gossip interminably . Once on a rainy night I listened to a very old man and a very young geisha talk hour after hour . He had chronic bronchitis that kept him nervous , and he was nervous also because he did not want to oversleep , a fact that he told her again and again . He must be awake at 4 A.M. because he was making a pilgrimage to a shrine , toward which he had already been walking the last three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The geisha takes to the life for reasons that seem sham to us . The family property is mortgaged , and she sells herself to free it . She has a brother who shows promise , ought to go to the university , and she sells herself to get the money . The greatest curse is that she can not buy her way back into the free world . She must be bought . So the system is essentially slavery . Add to this that the Japanese does not think of sexual intercourse as we do . He thinks more biologically . I spoke once to the eminent Kitasato of the Institute of Infectious Diseases . He had had a student who had also attained eminence , and , as was well known , had let that student slip through his fingers . I reminded him of this . He admitted it freely . " I knew he had talent . But I would not have anyone that irregular in my laboratory . I would not have anyone come and hang his hat , then goand stay three weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more active sexual life than an American student was apt to have the opportunity or inclination to live , and Kitasato absent-mindedly agreed , but then conclusively corrected : " As to that , that makes no difference . I was interested only in his irregular hours . " In Japan they are always careful to tell you that the geisha system is not harlotry , and this is true , though it does inevitably reach down to that indefinite line where harlotry begins . I once saw a chalk-water sign written on the wall of a small-town employment bureau . It read : WANTED One first-class geisha Three second-class geisha Two prostitutes Three maidservants Add to that list , One wife , and you have pretty well covered the feminine range . Three Doctors I have known many Japanese doctors . I am selecting three . I am not at all meaning to suggest that these three are a cross-section of Japanese medicine . Human beings are everywhere of every kind . I select the three to point into one more dark corner of the Japanese mind , because with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first doctor I met in Sendai at a science meeting . He was a physiologist , like myself , sat across from me at table , invited me to visit his laboratory in Fukuoka . Afterward he wrote me and telegraphed several times . Fukuoka seemed out of the way , but I felt obligated and went . I arrived at eleven at night , was met by the Professor and his assistant , and taken to the Professor 's house . The Professor was in frock . He apologized that his wife was not able to be there to bow to me . The night was warm and the house smelled of wet wood . The toilets of most Japanese houses are primitive but satisfactorily disguised from the sense most concerned . This one was not . The Professor apologized several times more that his wife was not able to be there to meet me ? but would I hear his two sons play the piano ? He brought them in . They were eleven and thirteen , wore military-looking school uniforms . The piano was a second-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death there , shipped across the country , then across the ocean , then several hundred miles from Yokohama to this house . It was out of tune . Furthermore , Japanese feeling for Occidental music is at the worst wretched , and at the best unnatural . The boys went to the piano , sat stiffly , played as under the spell of a drum-major a Mozart duct . This was about midnight . It was in all ways an extraordinary performance . The father 's professorial face grew redder and redder with feeling , as when a Japanese drinks sake , and when the boys were through their tremendous and futile effort / praised them exorbitantly . Perhaps because of the praise the Professor led me round his house . He apologized again that his wife was not able to be there to meet me . He showed me the common treasures of the Japanese house . He pushed over one of the wood partitions . There was a shelf behind it . On the shelf in a soldierly row stood a display of shiny Occidental toys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very young child and must have been kept in that excellent preservation since the boys were bailiff . Queer to prize them in the way the old Professor so plainly did . Later he spread a quilt on the strawmatted floor and there I was to sleep . That was next the garden , which lay in darkness . A turtle would walk to the edge of the pool , flop in . Then another turtle . This parade kept up . It was all like the third act of an Ibsen drama , had that neurotic quality . I could not sleep . I kept seeing that row of shiny toys . In the morning the Professor took me around the town , which stood up overthe sea , showed me where the Chinese had attempted an invasion six hundred years before and failed . This pleased him . About four in the afternoon he put me with his assistant on a train , the assistant to go along as far as the next station , so that I should not get lost . The assistant knew a little English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly , in the midst of his dreary talk , and in the same dreary tone , he let fall : " The Professor , his baby , the beloved , the one they waited for so long , died yesterday before you came , of diphtheria . " It was like a dash of cold water . It explained everything . It was why the wife was not there to meet me . It was the reason for the row of shiny toys . It accounted for the strong feeling at the piano playing . But why had the old man not just told me , especially when he was so pointedly showing me the toys and so repeatedly apologizing for the absence of his wife ? I understood everything , and I understood nothing . The second doctor I met in Tokyo : It was on my third visit to Japan , and I was there to gather material for the writing of a biography of the Japanese bacteriologist of the Rockefeller Institute , Noguchi . I was admitted into an Occidental waiting room . Many houses in Tokyo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after office hours and there were no patients , but the doctor and three men were in earnest talk round a table . The doctor beckoned me to a chair , asked me to rest there a few moments , and the talk with the three went on . Evidently something grave . Finally the three left . The doctor had a maidservant bring in cocoa and cakes , sat himself opposite me , began to talk to me in German . But he did not know German . He tried heroically . His voice kept rising . What he was wanting to pound into me were certain details , utterly useless to me , of a meeting that he had had with the subject of my biography , twelve years before , in a hotel , in a back room in Vienna . A sweaty , gasping , meaningless monologue , his finger always irritatingly in my face . Suddenly he stopped . I got to my feet and to the door . Then , just as I was passing through , I turned and asked him I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They ? Those three ? Physicians . Specialists . We were in consultation over my wife , who is mortally ill . " Mortally ill , and he had talked to me passionately for two and one-half hours . Again I understood everything , and understood nothing . The third doctor I had met previously in America . He was physician to the Emperor , a distinguished man , a fastidious man , would put on his gray silk glove each time before he touched a doorknob . He was one of a committee that had been paid with American money to come and see whatever there was to see of American institutions . I arrived at his Tokyo house in the early afternoon . He showed me etchings , then Japanese prints , then amateur paintings that he had exchanged with amateur doctor painters all over the world . This took hours . It got to be half past five in the afternoon . He put aside the last painting . He said : " I am taking you out to dinner . I would be having you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there dying of cancer . " He pointed as he spoke to the Oriental rear of the house . He spoke English , spoke quietly and , I thought , casually . To any national of any other country I should certainly have answered : " You will not take me to dinner . You will go now to your wife . I deeply regret that I did not know . " Instead I did not so much as say I was sorry , his way of speaking having completely excluded mc . What we did was start for Yeno Park , where we ate an Occidental dinner of many courses , listened to the music , then walked and talked in the amusement places till midnight . I remember what we talked about last . We had both been to Geneva , so we talked of Da'craze eurythmics ? dancing . That doctor 's wife died the very next day . What is it ? Is it callousness ? Or just calm ? Is it capacity to cover pain ? Or just incapacity to suffer pain ? I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not any one of these qualities altogether . What I do feel is that we have here an attitude toward mental pain which when it exists in an enemy ? by nature , or so bred into him as to make it indistinguishable from nature ? becomes a force bound steadily to affect the course of war .
