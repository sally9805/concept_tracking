General Charles de Gaulle , a man of rigid dissatisfaction , indicated last week that he was still dissatisfied with " arrangements " between France and her allies . Particularly , Cordell Hull 's recent assurances ( TIME . April 17 ) left much to be desired . <P> The Secretary of State had said that the U.S. was disposed to let the Gaullists " exercise leadership " in the civil administration of liberated France . With good reason , General de Gaulle suspected that this promise left a loophole for dealings with others in France , stuck to his never-deviating demand for exclusive sovereignty . <P> Did the General realize that some people still had misgivings about his alleged dictatorial inclinations ? The General smiled : " An old story . For four years contradictory charges have been made against me and the Committee . . . De Gaulle wanted to be a dictator , he wanted to restore the Third Republic ... he would deliver France to communism or that he was an instrument of the Americans , British or Stalin . I shall not reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictatorship , whether French or foreign . But the French want a government that governs . "
