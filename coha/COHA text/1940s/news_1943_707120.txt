txt In the midst of the prolonged and heated controversy that has arisen over the Ruml pay-as-you-go plan , the nature of the withholding tax that is now scheduled to go into effect on July 1 has been largely overlooked . The fact that Republicans , Democrats and sponsors of the numberless compromise pay-as-you-go plans all took over the committee withholding tax without question has led to the mistaken belief that the proposed withholding tax is a good one . It is , in fact , about as badly devised as it could possibly be . One of the most important tasks now before the Senate Finance Committee is to revise and simplify it . The withholding tax framed by the Ways and Means Committee is so incredibly complicated that the committee has had to insert in the bill no fewer than twenty-seven tables , consisting of about a hundred and seventy items each , to help employers figure out the tax . The basic cause of this fantastic complication is not obscure . The withholding tax passed by the House is , in fact , an attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different principles , into one . The withholding tax totals 20 per cent on income above exemptions . But it is made up of one tax of 17 per cent above one set of varying exemptions , and another tax of 3 per cent above a single flat exemption . Just why the Ways and Means Committee chose this incongruous mixture passes all understanding  --  unless it was from a love of complication for its own sake , or simply out of pure cussedness . The 3 per cent tax based on all incomes above a flat annual exemption of $624 is obviously an attempt to retain the Victory tax . But it should have been clear to the members of the committee that once they imposed a general withholding tax , containing the varying exemptions of the regular income tax , based on the family status of the individual , a separate " Victory " tax with a single flat exemption became altogether unnecessary . Obviously the Victory tax ought now to be absorbed in the regular income tax system . The withholding tax ought to be a simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) with only one set of exemptions . What ought these exemptions to be ? Illogical relationships have crept into our present income tax , and are retained in the present proposed withholding tax . They are illogical because the lawmakers responsible for them forgot the basic principle on which any such exemptions can be justified . The principle is that there is a minimum level of subsistence for any ' individual or family and that no income tax ought to cut below that minimum subsistence level . The difference between the exemption for a single man and for a married man should be based on the obvious fact that the minimum subsistence income for a married couple is higher than that for a single individual . But in no case can it be argued that the minimum subsistence level of a married couple without children is more than twice as great as the minimum subsistence level of a single man . Yet while a single man is today allowed a tax-free exemption of only $500 , a married man without children is allowed an exemption of $1,200 . Under normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the presumptive economy achieved in rent  --  is somewat less than twice as great as that of a single individual . This relationship was recognized in our earlier income tax laws . It is recognized today in the British income tax law , which grants an exemption of f80 for a single person and of ? 140 for a man living with a wife . The double-barreled withholding tax passed by the House would allow a single man $500 exemption . under its first tax , and $624 exemption , under its second . It would allow a married man without children $1,200 exemption under one tax , and $624 exemption under the other . Such a system cries out for simplification . There would be a great gain both in simplicity and equity if the relic of the Victory tax were forgotten altogether , in the new withholding tax , and if that withholding tax consisted , say , of a flat rate of 20 per cent based on a single set of exemptions exactly corresponding with those of the income tax . This set of exemptions should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical than they are today . One possible solution would be to raise the exemption of single individuals from $500 to the $624 now used under the Victory tax , and to reduce the exemption of the married man without children to $1,000 ( or to $1,040 to correspond to an exact $20 a week as the $624 corresponds to an exact $12 a week ) . But the withholding tax ought to be a single tax that employers can calculate without going mad .
