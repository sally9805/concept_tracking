Blytheville , Ark. had never seen so many folks before . On Ross Hughes 's farm there were 15,000 of them-come from as fur away as Texas to see the first annual cotton-picking championship of the U. S. <P> It was Roscoe Crafton 's idea . Set a-thinkin ' by the national publicity given the Corn Belt 's annual corn-husking championship , he got some fellow cotton merchants to form an association last winter , sow the seeds of a national cotton-picking contest . " Wide open to the world " it would be . So they sent invitations to the Cotton Belt 's Rotary , Kiwanis and Lions clubs , asking them to sponsor an entrant apiece . <P> Last week 136 contestants showed up : men &; women , black &; white , day laborers , land-owning farmers from eleven States . Some came as free-lance pickers ( paying their own $10 entry fee ) , but the majority represented civic-minded cotton communities . Each entrant was given two half-mile rows to pluck . A good cotton picker , pacing himself for a day 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour . But last week 's pickers were after something more than a day 's pay . When the two-hour limit was up , one of the pickers had turned in 129 Ib. of " good clean cotton . " He was 15-year-old Harold Mason , a shy , gangling Senath , Mo . schoolboy , youngest competitor in the field . <P> If he had picked that cotton for Planter Hughes the day before , young Mason would have been paid about 75 . Last week he got $1,000 and the title " first world 's champion cotton picker . " Descendant of a long line of farm folk , Schoolboy Mason intends to use his prize money for an agriculture course at the University of Missouri .
