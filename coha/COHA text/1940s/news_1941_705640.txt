txt Leon Henderson , Federal Price Control Administrator , fixed maximum prices today on hides , calf skins and kips in an effort to bring down the cost of shoes to govern- I ment and civilian consumers . A ceiling of 15 cents a pound was put on hides . This is 2 cents below the highest price recently paid , but Mr. Henderson said that it was not expected to cause " any serious hardship , since the volume of sales at above 15 cents has been relatively small . " Maximum prices for calf skins were fixed at 20% to 27% cents a pound on the Chicago market , depending on size , and at $1.30 to $4.60 a hide on the New York market , depending on weight . Twenty cents a pound was established as the maximum price for kips . " Cattle hides and kip and calf skins are the basic raw materials of the shoe and leather industry , " Mr. Henderson declared . Extent of Use Is Noted " Shoes and other leather products are purchased in large quantities by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industrial leather . Shoes are one of the most important single items in the average family clothing budget and a substantial factor in the personal equipment of the military forces . " Marked increases in shoe prices would be a serious threat to stability in the living costs of all members of the community . Accordingly it is apparent that instability of hide and leather prices would be inimical to the general public wel-fare , " Since August , 1940 , hide prices have risen steadily , with only an occasional slight interruption in their upward trend . Shoe prices have been under pressure from hide prices . Beginning in February , 1941 , this upward trend became so pronounced as to stimulate speculative buying of hides and skins and forward buying of shoes and other leather products . " On March 15 , in an effort to check this inflationary spiral , the price stabilization division of the advisory commission to the Council of National Defense issued a general warning pointing out that the basic supply and demand factors did not justify increases in hide prices and attributing sudh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Despite this warning hide prices in recent weeks have reached their highest level since 1928 , ' with the exception of one week in 1937 . " These increased prices have been reflected in the latest bids on shoes for the Army and the Civilian Conservation Corps . Therefore the War Department rejected all bids on 1,000,008 pairs of shoes for the Army and 283,816 pairs of shoes for the Civilian Conservation Corps . " In cases of failure to comply with the order , Mr. Henderson said , his office would " make every effort to insure that the Congress and the public are fully informed and that the powers of the government are fully exerted in order to protect the public interest and the interests of those persons who conform . " Under the order , brokers will be permitted to charge commissions of 3 per cent . Contracts made before Monday at higher prices may be carried out if they can be completed by Aug. 15 . The hides maximum of 15 cents a pound is " f. o. b .
