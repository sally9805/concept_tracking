The Argentines are a proud and freedom-loving people who like to boast about their disregard of laws and restrictions and how they run their lives to suit themselves . But they are also great admirers of efficient government . Last week they wondered which horn of this dilemma they preferred . <P> Dour , puritanical President Pedro Ramirez had signed his 7,240th decree since taking office ( TIME , June 14 ) and was still going strong . His Government was efficient as all get-out , but it was channeling Argentine lives into a path of righteousness and cultural uplift as they had never been channeled before . A few of the 7,240 : <P> &gt; Textile firms found prices and quality of their products strictly regulated , as did medical industries , sugar , cheese and other food producers , raw-film manufacturers and private shipping companies whose rates were considered too high . <P> &gt; Rubber and tire factories awoke to the fact that the Government had taken over their stock . <P> &gt; The Government decreed the type of sun and sunrays to be used on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be approved by the Health Department . <P> &gt; The Buenos Aires Zoo was taken over by the Government , on charges that animals were underfed and funds improperly disbursed . <P> &gt; To conserve power , 4 o'clock nightclubs and dance halls were ordered closed at 2:30 or 3 , movies and theaters be tween 11:30 and 12 . <P> &gt; Stores with odd street numbers were made to close an hour earlier on odd days , even-numbered ones an hour earlier on even days . <P> &gt; One apartment house with maid service was ordered to change linen twice weekly , since the Government considered one weekly change not enough . <P> &gt; To save gas , taxis on the main downtown thoroughfares were ordered to wait for fares in the middle of the street instead of pulling in to the curb . <P> Decrees like these had Argentine citizens wavering between mirth and exasperation , as was a businessman who , working late one night , was visited by inspectors and ordered to go home . But there were other decrees on the more serious side : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for housing improvements , taxation and social welfare . Colonel Alberto Gilbert , Minister of the Interior , announced forthcoming trade and employment registration , labor and accident insurance , old-age insurance and reorganization of the country 's municipal system based on present U.S. systems . <P> &gt; Corrupt officials hanging over from the Castillo regime were being cleaned out daily ; arrests made included ex-governors of provinces , deputies , municipal counselors and the like . <P> &gt; Radio programs were cleaned up drastically , obnoxious commercials banned or cut down to 100 words between programs , classical music made compulsory at least once daily , serials , quiz shows , announcements and song lyrics* subjected to strict censorship to cut out slang and uplift the cultural level . <P> Such actions Argentines could admire . Still they wondered-especially as they wandered into restaurants and found that the Government had published regulations regarding the making and selling of sandwiches . <P> *One tango hit , To Content the Old Lady , was renamed To Gratify Mother .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
