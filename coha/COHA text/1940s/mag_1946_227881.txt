CALIFORNIA <P> As a glib , dreamy-eyed kid in Los Angeles ' teeming Central Avenue neighborhood , Charlie Edwards felt himself a cut above the other Negro youngsters . He had bold ideas of becoming a great writer or famous legal light . But school bored him . When unappreciative teachers filled his report card with F 's , Charlie brightly forged them all into A 's . <P> It took Charlie a while to find himself . He drifted restlessly from job to job . Once he tried writing a column for a Negro weekly . After he had described an imaginary interview with Hitler , the editor demoted him to chauffeur . The outlook was gloomy when Charlie was caught signing a friend 's name to a check . <P> Imagination and his handy penmanship , however , altered Charlie 's destiny . He faked a civil service rating and got a job as deputy in the county jail . Deftly he removed his criminal record from the sheriff 's files . He awarded a Master of Arts degree to himself and carried around a photostatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured admission to the California bar . To reinforce the illusion , he attended a few law classes at Loyola University in Los Angeles . <P> In the role of a rising young attorney , light-complexioned Charlie cut a social swath . He wangled invitations to Hollywood benefits , and ran up a $2,000 bill for rented evening clothes . When the photographers exploded their flash bulbs , Charlie would sidle alongside the celebrities . His picture appeared in the papers with Singer Lina Romay , Van Johnson and Victor Mature ( see cut ) . <P> The Veteran . Charlie became a familiar figure at political rallies , usually edged his way to the speakers ' platform . To widen his connections , he wrote himself membership cards in the Knights of Columbus , Ku Klux Klan , B'nai B'rith , the Communist Party and Gerald L. K. Smith 's America First . He slipped into the studio of radio station KFWB during a memorial broadcast for F.D.R. , and was on the air before anyone could stop him . <P> When the U.S. went to war , Charlie told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he sent the board a postcard announcing his death . Later he was seen on Central Avenue in a captain 's uniform , smartly returning the salutes of passing enlisted men . At war 's end he donned a veteran 's button , began campaigning on G.I. political programs , and set his hopes on a City Council seat . <P> Last week the bold career of 28-year-old Charlie Edwards suddenly collapsed . Los Angeles police , tipped off by investigators from the state bar association , jailed Charlie on a half-dozen local and federal counts . His counsel indicated that Charlie would plead insanity because of a brain tumor . Said Charlie : " Sometimes I do seem to get dizzy spells . "
