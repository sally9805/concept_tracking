Two new starters entered the postwar automobile race last week . <P> The Tucker Torpedo , a completely new car designed by a completely new company ( the Tucker Corp. ) , looks like a backward bullet . It has a 150-h.p. , six-cylinder aircraft-type engine in the rear , a fuel-injection system eliminating the carburetor , a new type of drive shaft and transmission . It is expected to weigh some 800 lbs . less than the average car , cost from $1,500 to $1,800 . <P> So far this dream car is still largely in the dream stage . Tucker President Preston Tucker has little more than a ten-year lease ( beginning next March ) on a plant in Chicago , a staff of 125 , a pile of blueprints . All he now needs : 1 ) investors to buy a $20,000,000 stock issue still to be registered with the SEC , 2 ) production equipment , 3 ) materials . <P> The Willys-Overland postwar hopeful is a low-slung , short ( 104-in. wheel base ) , but ingeniously designed two-door six-cylinder sedan . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow rear seat . Other features : independent suspension of front wheels ( no axle ) , and universal joints in the rear axle designed to take much of the bump out of bumps . Proposed price : around $1,300 . <P> Willys does not expect full-scale production till next May . It hopes the car does better than the $21,000,000 stock issue which helped finance it . Offered at $100 a share last June , the new Willys preferred stock was cold-shouldered by old Willys stockholders , then snubbed by the general public . Last week , still holding 75% of the new issue , the underwriters ( Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. and 45 other firms ) gave up trying to float the stock at $100 , decided to let it find its own price level . The price promptly bounced down to $60 . Price bid at week 's end : $61 . Total paper loss to underwriters : approximately $4,000,000.
