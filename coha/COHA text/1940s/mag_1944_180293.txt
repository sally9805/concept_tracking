When Max Herskovitz got back home to The Bronx from a Jap internment camp in China , he found a check for $67 . The money was from New York 's Associated Hospital Service to reimburse him for a bill he paid to Shanghai 's County Hospital last July . All the time he was interned , Mrs. Herskovitz had faithfully kept up the insurance payments . <P> His was the first reimbursement the Service has made for hospitalization in the Orient . The Service , now well out of its lean years , almost foundered in the mid- ' 30s , when it had no safeguards against families which joined just in time for Mamma to have a baby .
