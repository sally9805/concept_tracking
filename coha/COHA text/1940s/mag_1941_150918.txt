Every U.S. corporation that has commercial ties with Germany studied an announcement by the Department of Justice last week . It was a consent decree signed with No. 1 U.S. drugmaker Sterling Products Inc . ( Bayer Aspirin , Phillips Milk of Magnesia , Fletcher 's Castoria , many another branded &; unbranded drug ) . <P> To those who recalled Thurman Arnold 's highly seasoned attacks on sinister Nazi influences on U.S. business , the wording of Justice 's victorious announcement tasted like milk toast . It went out of its way to pat Sterling on the back . It was nonetheless a victory , for the Department of Justice , for the vigorous anti-Nazi elements in Sterling 's management , and for their mentor , Thomas Gardiner Corcoran , who ( as Sterling 's counsel ) worked out the deal . It also patterned one method by which U.S. corporations can cancel German contracts without subjecting themselves to stockholders ' suits . <P> Sterling , three of its subsidiaries* and its two top officers signed the decree . They plead nolo contendere to charges of restricting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dye Trust . They agreed to pay fines totaling $26,000 and to break all contractual relations with the Farben . They also agreed never again to promise any other drug manufacturer not to compete in foreign markets . <P> Sterling 's agreements with I. G. Farben date back to the early ' 20s , after its predecessor had bought the Bayer patents ( which belonged to a Farben predecessor ) from the U.S. Alien Property Custodian , but failed in a legal fight to extend them to Latin America . The agreement let Sterling make Farben products and sell them in Latin America , but only on commission ( 25% ) . Sterling processed these drugs ( usually from German raw materials ) , had $10,000,000 worth of plant in Latin America , but the drugs bore Farben 's names . The agreements , until last week , still had 30-35 years to run . <P> If the U.S. were at war with Germany , Sterling could have canceled this contract , ceased being Farben 's sales stooge in Latin America . But without a state of war , Sterling officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal impossibility . " The value of the contract has been estimated as high as $100,000,000 . Since both Sterling Chairman William Weiss and President Albert Diebold are multimillionaires , they were in no position to cancel the contract . <P> The consent decree , being a court order , gives Sterling 's officers a Government-underwritten legal out . Meanwhile , to rid the company of any pro-Nazi stigma , the directors last fortnight got Sterling a new president and chairman . ( Messrs . Weiss and Diebold moved upstairs to head newly created Board committees . ) The new chairman : Edward Sidney Rogers , international patent lawyer and adviser to the State Department . The new president : ex-Sterling treasurer , ex-U.S . Internal Revenue Bureau official , James Hill Jr . Mr. Rogers ' knowledge of international law will be especially useful . For although Sterling is relatively safe in the U.S. , it can expect trouble from 20 different legal codes if it enters Farben 's Latin American market on its own .               @ @ @ @ @ @
