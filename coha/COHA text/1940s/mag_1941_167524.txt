Alicia Patterson Simpson Brooks Guggenheim , thrice-married favorite daughter of Captain Joe Patterson , last week all but called her father a liar . In her year-old tabloid , the Hempstead ( L.I. ) Newsday , pretty , 34-year-old Alicia wrote an editorial , THAT 80 PER CENT , about isolationist claims that " 80% of the American people are against our going into the war . " It began : " You remember the old gag : ' Figures do n't lie-but liars sometimes figure . ' " The 80% claim has been pushed particularly by the Chicago Tribune , published by her cousin Colonel Robert McCormick , and the New York Daily News , published by her father . <P> All this was just a sign that Daughter Alicia is a member in good standing of the Patterson-McCormick family , a clan of determined individualists . From her paper it has long been plain that she is no isolationist , but as she says : " Father and I are still very great friends . " They do not attempt to reconcile their editorial difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) Meantime she goes on reviewing books for her father 's Sunday News . ( " It gives me a chance to get a lot of reading done that I would n't do otherwise . " ) <P> In her office hang the originals of two creepy Daily News cartoons depicting " Uncle Sap " being seduced by the skeleton-headed harlot " World War II , " gifts of her good friend Daily News Cartoonist C. D. Batchelor . Her managing editor , 39-year-old Harold A. Davis , came from the Daily News , as did several Newsday reporters . In the last elections she borrowed the Daily News idea of a " Battle Page . " * Her biggest help came from the Daily News 's late great promotion wizard , Max Annenberg . Max coached her on all the tricks of the trade , got her a general manager , William Mapel , ex-managing editor of the Wilmington ( Del . ) Morning News and Journal-Every Evening , regretted he could not also give her Daily News features because their territory overlapped . <P> " The News has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meantime well-edited Newsday , claiming only 2,000 less circulation than its 20-year-old Republican competitor , the Nassau Review-Star ( circ. 32,000 ) , has won the Ayer typography award , hopes soon to turn a profit . <P> <P> * Calling it " The Squared Circle , " in three issues she filled the right-hand side with pro-Roosevelt editorials . The left-hand side was filled with pro-Willkie editorials by her husband of two years , Harry Frank Guggenheim , 51-year-old copper tycoon , ex-Ambassador to Cuba , aviation patron . ( " My husband is traditionally a Republican . I 'm not traditionally anything . " )
