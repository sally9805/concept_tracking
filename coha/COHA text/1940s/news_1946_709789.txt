txt If the principles agreed to at Potsdam a year ago by Premier Stalin , Prime Minister Attlee and President Truman . , had been lived up to , Secretary Byrnes ' speech at Stuttgart yesterday would not have been news . All that Mr. Byrnes did was to restate as our present policy the positions we argued for or accepted at Potsdam . In so far as his remarks were directed at Russia they were an appeal from the Russia of September , 1946 , to the Russia of August , 1945 . In so far as they were directed at the Germans they were a reaffirmation of our desire to keep promises as well as to carry out penalties . In so far as they were directed at the American people they were a statement of accepted ideals , tempered by hard practicalities . At Potsdam it was agreed that " Germany shall be treated as a single economic unit . " We hold to that agreement . At Potsdam it was agreed that " essential central German administrative departments * * shall be established , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foreign trade and industry . " We hold to that agreement , and in the absence of Russian and French cooperation are now trying to carry it out with the British . At Potsdam it was agreed that the occupying Powers should " prepare for the eventual reconstruction of German political life on a democratic basis and for eventual peaceful cooperation in international life by Germany . " We hold to that agreement . At Potsdam we agreed that Russia should have Koenigsberg and adjacent areas . We hold to that agreement . At Potsdam we agreed that " the final delimitation of the western frontier of Poland should await the peace settlement . " We hold to that agreement . On Germany 's western frontier we have gone a little farther . We are now willing that France should have the Saar , though not willing that she or any other Power should have or dominate . the Ruhr and the Rhineland . In this case , as in Venezia Giulia and East Prussia , we have conceded for expediency 's sake that some populatiops must either move or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of such surrenders of principle . " Except as here indicated , " says Mr. Byrnes , " the United States will not support any encroachment on territory which is indisputably German or any division of Germany which is not genuinely desired by the people concerned . " At Potsdam we agreed that " for the time being no central German government shall be established. - We now believe that this " time being " has about run its course . We favor the establishment of a provisional government , under the supervision of the Allied Control Council . We hold that " the German people , throughout Germany , under proper safeguards , should now be given the primary responsibility for the running of their own affairs . " Emphatically this does not mean that we are in a hurry to turn Germany entirely over to the Germans and get out . Mr. Byrnes is clear on this point : We will not shirk our duties . We are not withdrawing . As long as an occupation force is required in Germany the Army of the United States will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byrnes does propose is that the occupying Powers agree on an inspection system which will require fewer occupation troops , yet which can be quickly implemented if any deception or resistance is attempted . We are just as firmly determined now as we were a year ago that Germany shall never again be able to threaten the world 's peace . We suggest that the German people be given some inducement to keep the peace ; that they be rewarded by greater freedom when they have earned it ; that they be encouraged to make a fresh start in life ; that they be not ground down , contrary to the spirit of the Potsdam agreement , by reparations taken from production . If this were wholly an age of reason Mr. Byrnes ' proposals could be discussed on their merits and amended as to details , though scarcely as to principles . Since this is not wholly an age of reason , and since a struggle has actually been going on over Germany 's diseased and crippled body , there will be emotions as well as merits to deal ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Russian attitude . A free and democratic Germany , restricted only in her power to make war , would incline toward the Western democracies without any pressure on their part . Russia , on the other hand , does have to exert pressure to keep non-Slavic countries , or parts of countries , within her orbit . From a narrow and short-range point of view Mr. Byrnes is trying to push the famous iron curtain eastward . But even Moscow might profit by thinking twice about the matter . The alternative to a united , productive and peaceable Germany is a divided Germany which will tend more and more to be absorbed into two opposing military systems . We propose a Germany which in the long run would be a bridge between the East and the West , not a wasteland through which opposing trenches weave their ghastly pattern . We propose peace and perpetual disarmament in Germany , peace and cooperation between the two doctrinal halves of this One World .                  @ @ @
