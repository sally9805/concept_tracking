When negotiations for a new Anglo-Iraqi treaty were going swimmingly in Britain , the Foreign Office thought it would be a nice gesture for King George VI to send Iraq 's regent , Prince Abdul <P> Illah , three pairs of royal swans. * Then angry Iraqis in Bagdad rejected the treaty ( TIME , Feb. 2 ) and forced their chief negotiator , Prime Minister Saleh Jabr , to flee to Trans-Jordan scrunched down in the back seat of his car with bullets whistling after . No one remembered to call off the shipment of swans . <P> Last week , King George 's Swan Keeper Fred Turk , with four assistants , dutifully and warily rounded up six squawking swans from the Thames at Cookham , packed them off in pairs to hiss and sputter on the odoriferous Tigris at Bagdad . The London News Chronicle muttered sarcastically : " Might help , though . " <P> * By ancient prerogative , the King shares ownership of Thames swans between Southwark Bridge and Henley with two City companies - the Worshipful Companies of Dyers and Vintners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " swan markers round up the flocks and allocate the young cygnets . One nick is made in the lower bill to mark a Dyers ' swan , two for a Vintners ' ; His Majesty 's go nickless.
