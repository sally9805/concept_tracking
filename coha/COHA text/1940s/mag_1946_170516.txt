THE ANCIENT MAYA ( 520 pp. ) - Sylvanus G. Morley-Sfanford University Press ( $10 ) . <P> Bat-haunted and deserted for centuries , the mysterious limestone cities of the Maya crouch in the Yucatan bush and the Guatemalan-Honduran jungles . They were already in ruins when Hernando Cortes marched into Mexico 400 years ago to teach Montezuma 's Aztecs a Spanish lesson . The names of those deserted cities echo with a kind of distant , mournful music : Tikal , Copan , Chichen Itza , Uxmal , Mayapan . <P> Sylvanus G. Morley of the Carnegie Institution of Washington , who has worked in the Maya country for 40 years , is the man who discovered some of its most famous monuments and directed Carnegie 's elaborate restorations in Yucatan . Even he can not unravel all the tangles of the Maya past , but this patient , expert , profusely illustrated book is by far the best general survey of the mystery as a whole : who were the ancient Maya , how did their civilization arise , why did it fall ? <P> Knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote cousins of the Inca , the Iroquois and the Eskimo . Squat , copper-colored , often cross-eyed ( admiring crossed eyes , they hung beads of resin before the eyes of their infants to induce a squint ) , they were wise , brilliant , cruel . <P> <P> They produced delicate works of art , designed remarkable buildings-and tossed human victims screaming into a holy well , or held them while a priest groped for the heart with a sharp stone knife . <P> Archaeologist Morley thinks that the Maya , rather than the Inca , were the first of the New World people to cultivate corn . Out of this skill and the sedentary rooted life it led to , they evolved their extraordinary culture . Just when the Maya flowering began he can merely guess at , but by the dawn of the Christian era there was probably already a considerable Maya civilization in what is now the Guatemala Department of Petn . <P> By A.D. 300-400 , this civilization had accomplished marvels . It had an exact chronology , a " more accurate knowledge of astronomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arithmetical system involving the concept of zero , a complex hieroglyphic writing ( much of which is still undeciphered ) , highly accomplished arts &; crafts . Yet the Maya were aboriginal people-without metal tools of any kind , without beasts of burden , without even a wheel . <P> The Flowering . During the next few hundred years , they spread north , east and south , until Maya cities &; towns dotted an area of 125,000 square miles . No one knows the total number of settlements , but there were " countless " small ones , and at least 100 that were metropolitan enough to have temples , statues and hieroglyphs . Tikal , in Guatemala , may have had a population of 200,000 or more ; its ruins cover several hundred acres , and include five temples , one of them over 200 feet high . Copan , in Honduras , has within its inner group of buildings a sizable stadium , sculptured stairways , terraces , pyramids . At Chichen Itza and Uxmal in Yucatan were colonnades , palaces , and a series of stone courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
