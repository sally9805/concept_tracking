txt As the Allied position in the shell-swept lines around Salerno shifted from dangerous to grave today , anxiety became apparent not only in political , diplomatic and military circles here , but among the great mass of Londoners over the future of the Allied arms policy in Italy . 1 Many factors have aroused this feeling : Benito Mussolini 's release by the Germans and the Allied failure to secure him from Marshal Pietro Badoglio and the speed with which the Germans reinforced their army in southern Italy while the surrender negotiations were going on after months of heavy bombing of communications are among them . But perhaps the main factor is the impact of brutal facts upon the optimistic day dreams of an early peace enjoyed by most Britons as a result of Mussolini 's downfall and the striking Allied successes in the air , land and sea during the past six months . Pleas by Cabinet Ministers that the war was not won yet which were often confused by the assurance that it was from publicity seeking politicians failed to check this optimism . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several points at the Salerno bridgehead added weight to the sober warning from Sir Stafford Cripps , Minister of Aircraft Production , which was broadcast to the " factory front " in which he told the workers that the enemy was still " strong and determined . " The pendulum of public opinion has swung from gay to grim although the Government has never given any ground for the inflated optimism that has prevailed recently . German claims about the battle around Salerno are undoubtedly excessive , for the enemy must magnify every victory to impress the restive Balkans and the home front . But it is clear from all reports ' from the front and from consultation with the best-informed opinion here that the situation which yesterday was best described as ' dangerous is today grave . The Allies have certainly suffered a reverse although it is too early to judge its extent or influence on the future . The situation may be likened to that in Tunisia last December when the enemy position was tactically favorable but strategically impossible . Much has been made here of the prospects for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifth Armies . There is no basis to believe that this would bring a numerically superior force against the Germans or that it would be achieved speedily . General Sir Bernard L. Montgomery , commander of the Eighth Army , still is a hundred miles from the Salerno battlefield . The enemy claims that the forces opposing the Eighth Army have been disengaged , which may indicate that Field Marshal Erwin Rommel hopes to unite them with the forces facing the Fifth Army for an assault on the Salerno bridge , head in which we have admitted the loss of ground on a narrowed bridgehead . Riskiest of Operations Although the baler= landing was regarded by some as the coup de grace of the Italian campaign , it is evident now , and should have been evident then , that it was the riskiest major overseas operation of the war . Politically , the Allied Command hoped that the Italians would assist the Fifth and Eighth Armies . This has not been the case . From a military standpoint the Allies took a double risk : that the Germans would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashore in strength themselves , and that we would be able to seize airfields from which the landing forces could well be protected . What is evident now is that the delays were too long and that the Germans concentrated their forces , including several tank formations that fought with their customary skill and dash , and that Allied air cover , although inflicting great damage on the Luftwaffe , is not so effective as it would be had we been able to seize the airfields . Mention has been made of between NO and 800 sorties by the Allied air forces . It should be remembered that in fighting of this kind the important factor is the length of time that fighters can operate over a battlefield , not the number of flights they make . A glance at the map shows that this period is shortened by geographical limitatons . In short , , the invasion of Italy , which will eventually make that country the " ulcer " to Adolf Hitler that Spain was to Napoleon , has not begun well in the only area that the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political circles considerably . Major A. M. Lyons , M. P. for East Leicester , will ask Prime Minister Churchill when Parliament meets whether any stipulation had been made to insure his being handed over to the United Nations . Although , as one political source pointed out , Mussolini is repudiated by his own people and is not as potent as the once all-powerful leader of Italy , the British people are sorry that " Old Musso " skipped away and diplomats fear the effect of his release on the Balkans . A story in London to the effect that the Allies had five days in which to force Marshal Badbglio to turn Mussolini over to the Allies has not been denied . What is more important , it seems improbable that Mussolini was ever asked for by the Allied military authorities . Those who have been pressing for the trial of war criminals ask if this is to be a feature of future armistices . Politically and militarily , then , there is considerable anxiety . But this is infinitely preferable to the easy " it's-all-over-now spirit " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
