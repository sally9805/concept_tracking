Roman Holiday A Story by Robert Lewis Maestro ? " American said , " You wanted to see me , Maestro Maestro Arista , seated behind his desk , lifted his head . There was no expression on his long , ugly , leathery face . " Yes , " he said at length . " Sit down . " The two regarded each other . " How do you feel ? " the Maestro asked . " All right , " the American said . " You 're early , " the Maestro said . " I thought perhaps you might want to see me . " Maestro Arista , fencing-master , sighed and looked around his office . It was a large room , with a high ceiling . Photographs of various champion swordsmen , in positions of attack or defense , covered the painted brick walls . There were several action shots , most of them blurred , which had evidently been taken many years before , during the infancy of photography . One of them showed the Maestro as a young man scoring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward position of surprise , looking down at his chest , where the Maestro 's saber was bent upward in a high arch . The bronze plate beneath the picture read , " Genoa , 1910 . Professional Championships of Italy . Saber . Professor Alcide Arista , First Place . " On the opposite wall was an oil painting of a large man with heavy black moustaches ending in sharp points . Underneath was the inscription , " Professor Rodolpho Arista. 1852-1913 . The Greatest of Theirs All . " This was the Maestro 's father . " Have you seen the paper ? " the Maestro asked . The American nodded . Opening his drawer , Maestro Arista took out the Corriere , folded to the sports page . The date-line read , " Bologna , October 10 , 1941 . " Pointing to the lead article with his gnarled forefinger , the Maestro read , " ' American confident of victory in Bologna-Ferrara meet . ' " He stopped , and put on a large pair of hornrimmed glasses , which perched precariously half-way down his nose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the right of the article was a photograph showing the American leaning back comfortably on a chair at a table of a sidewalk cafe , regarding the camera with an air of confidence . The Maestro pointed under the photograph and read again , " ' Who 's afraid of Ponti ? asks American . ' " " I know , " said the American . " I saw it . " Pushing his spectacles higher on his nose , Maestro Arista leaned forward and read slowly , emphasizing his words with gestures of his paw : " The Bologna-Ferrara fencing meet , which will take place at 1700 today in the salle d'annes of Maestro Alcide Arista , former three-weapon national champion , has aroused considerable interest among sports fans , who are aware that the winning team will proceed to Rome to participate in the all-sectional championships , Category 2 , for the Mussolini Cup . In preparation for this important contest , Maestro Donati of Ferrara has re-organized his foil team . This unexpected move places Tommaso Ponti , hitherto considered the most powerful foilsman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vecchio , in the No. 3 position instead of his usual No . I. Curious to discover the reason for this surprise demotion , our reporter yesterday interviewed Maestro Donati and Ponti at Ferrara , and learned that Ponti is being primed to meet Maestro Arista 's new secret weapon , an unknown swordsman whom , it is rumored in the cafes , the Bolognese fencing-master has imported from America for his No. 3 spot , in a desperate effort to account for one additional point against the redoutable Ferrara . " The American lit a cigarette . Maestro Arista said to him , " Up to here , of course , this is nonsense . You have been with us for months , and we have never made a secret of you . This talk of importing is too idiotic even for the cafes , where almost anything is possible . As if 1 would import a fencer from America ! Would you come to Italy to find a baseball player ? No , the reporter made that up . Who was he ? " " A man named Bianchi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a dark complexion and a little beard the size of a postage stamp under his lip . " Arista shook his head . " I know the Corriere . There 's no such reporter on their staff . They must have brought him in from outside . " " He was from Naples . " At the Maestro 's raised eyebrows , the American explained , His accent . " Lowering his head again , the Maestro read on : " In the realization that our fencing public would be interested to know more about this mysterious American swordsman , our reporter today made private investigations in Bologna and unearthed his whereabouts . " ( " Of course , " the Maestro interpolated drily , " he could come to me . " ) " We found him at a cafe , where he had been drinking heavily . " ( " I had one vermouth , " said the American , " and a cup of coffee . " ) " In answer to our question , he asked , ' Ponti ? Ponti ? Who 's Ponti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years the undisputed champion of Ferrara and of the Infantry Division , of which he is a reserve officer , and that it would be his good fortune to cross blades with Ponti during the meet today . The American , who refused to give his name , did not appear to be impressed by Ponti 's formidable record ; dismissing airily the possibility that Ponti might defeat him in the contest , he expressed curiosity as to why Ponti was not at  - -  -  with his division . We hastened to beg him not to discuss military matters in public and expressed surprise that he should pretend to know the location of any of our troops , in view of the splendid solidarity ofthe Italian people behind the holy war against our perfidious northern neighbor and her even more perfidious ally , Great Britain . At this he smiled mysteriously and changed the subject . The only other statement we could elicit from him in regard to the meet today was that he intends to teach us Italians a few things about the sword , and that he is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's overinflated chest . " The Maestro drew back his lips over his teeth and said , " I know you did not say that . " " No , " said the American . " The last paragraph , " said the Maestro . He read : " This formidable swordsman from the other hemisphere is somewhat above middle height and slender . Although he appears to be wiry and quick , the effect of his dissolute life shows on his face , which might otherwise be called handsome . He is on the rash side of thirty . It is our impression that in every respect he compares unfavorably with Pond , who towers over him physically and morally . We are sure that a large audience will be present at the contest today to witness the attempt of this bragging American to autograph and de- flate the hitherto unbeatable Ponti . " T HE Maestro tossed the paper aside and deliberately removed his spectacles . He looked tired . For the first time the American noticed how many lines he had in his face . " Listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I must ask you some questions , in order to protect myself . This is perhaps more serious than you think . How much of this report is true ? " The American said , " Yesterday a reporter who called himself Bianchi introduced himself to me while I was sitting at the caf ? . He asked me if I was the American fencer on Maestro Arista 's team . When I said yes , a photographer snapped a picture , without asking my permission . In answer to the reporter 's questions , I said that I was Bologna 's No. 3 , that I expected to do my best today , and that I hoped to win . He did not ask my name , he did not mention Ponti , and there was no military discussion of any kind . The whole thing took three minutes and left me wondering why anyone had thought it worth while to interview me in the first place . " " I believe you , " the Maestro said . He got up and began to pace slowly up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated . He made a helpless gesture . " That only makes it worse , of course . " " Yes , " the American said . " What 's behind all this ? Why did he make up that fantastic story ? " " That 's not too hard to figure out . Italy is at war and America is selling war materiel to our enemies . Americans are not too popular here at the moment . Most of them have returned home . Your consulate refuses any further responsibility for you . There have been incidents . You yourself last week --  " " I know , " said the American . " Excuse me , " said the Maestro , stopping before the American 's chair and putting his hand to his chest in his characteristic gesture , " it 's none of my business , but why do n't you go home ? They must have made it very uncomfortable for you . Why do you stay ? " The American thought . Perhaps I can explain it to him . He would understand . Or would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell anybody that in the five years I have been here Italy has become a sort of second home for me , that I love everything but the politics , that I will not be pushed out until I am ready to go ? Can 1 tell him that I want to be here when Mussolini is destroyed by the substratum he has never reached and that I I want to be around to watch the real Italy come into its own again ? At the American 's long silence , Maestro Arista said , " Forgive me . It does n't really matter . You doubtless have your reasons . I 'm sure they are not political . " " No , I can assure you they 're not . " II " Well , then . " The Maestro resumed his ' pacing . You are a fencer . You practice in my salle . You take part in our tournaments . You become good . Because of your victories you deserve a place on our team , and professionally I am obligated to place you No. 3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mayor 's office comes to pay me a visit . He haS come to talk to me about you . Oh yes , they take that much interest in you . The authorities are concerned . Why does Maestro Arista place a foreigner on his team , when there are many Italian swordsmen for the place ? Is Marino no longer with us ? I answer that for twenty-eight years I have trained and kelected the team without any outside interference , and my father did it before me . Let a Bolognese fencer defeat you before judges and I will give him your place . " The American said , " Maestro , you will get into trouble over me . Why not replace Marino in No. 3 ? His record is excellent . " You beat Marino . You are the best man for the spot . " " Maestro --  " " Listen to me . I am an old man . For years I have watched the encroachments of these Fascist animals . I say nothing , 1 am not concerned with politics , I teach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not let them pick my team . What of my integrity ? What of my honor ? " The Maestro paced up and down , his hand at his chest . He burst out , " To hell with their politics ! I am still a man . I rub myself of them . " " Your blood-pressure , " the American said . " I spit on my blood-pressure . " But he walked to his desk and sat down . In a quieter voice he said , " I do not know these tricks . You will stay at No. 3 . If Ponti defeats you after this lying report , you will be held up to public ridicule , which may make you leave Italy . I do n't know . That 's up to you . I 'm doing what I have to do . " II W HEN the American walked into the locker room . most of the Bologna team were already there , putting on their fencing suits .

" Listen to me , all of you , " the American said at once . " I will not stand for this nonsense . That newspaper article was a tissue of lies from beginning to end . Anyone who does not believe me is calling me a liar . " His challenging glance swept the room . The men looked at each other for a moment . Then Marino arose and said to the room at large , " Idiots ! What did I tell you ? " A murmur arose and several of the men came over sheepishly and patted the American on the back . Silvestri , the No. 2 , said , " I never believed it . " Some one else said , " But why --  " The American shrugged , and the questioner , falling suddenly silent , walked back to his locker . Marino said , " You had better get dressed . " The American opened his locker and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundered . He nodded gratefully to Attilio , who winked back . Del Vecchio , who was already dressed , put his hand on the American 's shoulder and said , " How do you feel ? " " Fine . And you , champion ? " Everybody called Del Vecchio champion , because for years no one had been able to replace him in the coveted No. 1 position on the foil team . " Do n't let Ponti impress you , " said Del Vecchio . " He can be beaten . " Grinning , Marino said . " Of course . Otherwise he would be champion of the world . " One of the other men called out , " The Ferrara team has arrived . " Achille Ubaldini , an enormous man with the head of an overindulgent Nero , crowned with sparse . curly brown hair , came in and said , " The Ferrara team is here . " Ubaldini was a nationally ranking saberman , in spite of his weight . He was generally treated with great respect , because he had a had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duels . He was in addition a very able director and had been selected to act in that capacity for the meet . " Will you not fence saber for us today ? " called one of the men . " Idiot , " said Ubaldini indulgently . " You know I am in another category . " There was a bustle at the doorway , and Maestro Arista ushered in a group of men carrying long bags over their shoulders . The American picked out Ponti at once . He was wearing a light topcoat , but was hatless , his black hair slicked back smoothly over his head . He was as tall and broad as Ubaldini , without the fat . " He is a panther , " whispered Marino in the American 's ear . Ponti set his bag down on the floor and took possession of the room with his eyes . He said easily , " Greetings , Bologna . " Several of the men answered . " Welcome , Ferrara . " The newcomers found empty lockers and began to take their coats off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . Ubaldini nodded . " Ah , Del Vecchio , the champion , " said Ponti . Del Vecchio , who had never been able to beat Ponti , flushed and turned to his locker . MAGAZINE Ponti sat down , still wearing his coat , and said , " We meet again . " He looked around the room , smiling . His glance rested for a moment on the American , then flickered past him to Marino , who waved his hand airily . " A terrible thing has happened , my friends , " said Ponti. " 1 who have been No. 1 for years have been beaten . I have been demoted . I am now No. 3 . " He was smiling . Several of the men looked at the American with curiosity . " That is too bad , " said Marino maliciously . " I am desolate to hear it , for I too have been beaten and so will not have the pleasure of meeting you today . " " Ah ? " said Ponti , raising his black eyebrows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our Maestro has imported a killer from America , a gangster who has never been beaten . His record --  " Ubaldini said . " Be quiet , fool . " The American rose and said , " I am No. 3 . " Ponti got to his feet and came forward , They stood about two feet apart looking at each other . Ponti was almost a head taller . He seemed to dwarf the American . The other men fell silent , watching them . " An American , " said Ponti , at length . His smile was unpleasant . " And do Americans fence as well as fight with their fists ? " " A few of us . " " I thought Americans fought only with their fists . " " You are mistaken , I am afraid . " They stared at each other . Ubaldini said sourly , " Did you come here to talk , Ferrara ? " Ponti said , " I shall look forward to meeting you . " " You are very kind , " the American said politely . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen the article . Ponti walked back to his bench and began to undress . He said something in a low voice to one of his companions , who laughed . The other men resumed their preparations . There was little talking . Maestro Arista came in , talking to Donati , the fencing-master from Ferrara . The two stood just inside the doorway , talking and looking at the men in the room . Arista 's face was calm , while Donati , a short stocky man with a military bearing , was defiant and sullen . In a little while they walked out into ROMAN the fencing room , where the buzz of the audience began to make itself heard . HE fencing room was an enormous oblong . The building had been an ar- mory , which Arista 's father had bought from the government and converted to his use . The locker room , the Maestro 's office and living quarters had housed military offices , while the fencing room itself had been the battalion 's indoor parade ground . It was at least eighty feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Maestro Arista had laid down a dozen cork fencing-strips across the width , side by side ; these were used for practice , while the main strip , twice as wide as the others , ran for the regulation forty feet lengthwise down the center of the room , cutting across the others . This was the strip used for tournaments and team meets . Parallel with the main strip and facing it were the bleachers , now full of spectators . The first row had been reserved for the military , and was somi ber with black shirts , livened only by bright 1 campaign ribbons . Across the fencing room , facing the bleachers , were two benches set against the wall . These were for the two teams . They were some thirty feet apart , and between them , also against the wall , were four armchairs , reserved for any of the Fascist great who might attend . t The American and Marino came out facing the audience . A murmur arose , followed by silence as heads turned toward them . Looking straight ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You had better find a seat . " " Not with those pigs , " said Marino . " I sit on ! the bench . " He walked to the Bologna bench , the nearer of the two , and sat down . The American set down his bag and kneeled to open it . A shout echoed through the building , and a roar burst from the crowd . Looking up , startled , the American saw that the entire : roved was on its feet , arms extended in the Fascist salute , craning toward the entrance . someone cried , " 11 podeste " The mayor , nearing the black uniform with decorations , valked across the center of the room , ac , , nowledging the acclamation with waves of ? is hand . At his side walked a little man in a trown overcoat . His lower lip was protruded n an expression of distaste . When they cached the chairs between the two benches The American let himself be led into the Maestro 's darkened private room behind his office , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marino said , " They are talking in there . I 'd better go see what 's up . " " No , " said the American . " You 'd better wait here . Do you think he went through that play-acting for a laugh ? " Marino said , " I wondered if you knew . " They fell silent . The American thought , If only I had got one in before they grabbed me . He felt curiously calm , even a little weary . He closed his eyes and dozed a little . M Arm ? Arista entered and jerked his head at Marino , who got up and walked out . " Arnericano , " said Arista . The American did not move . " Americano , " Arista repeated . The American awoke and said , " Yes , Maestro . " " I have something to tell you . Ponti considers himself insulted . I pointed out on your behalf that it was he who struck the blow , but he says that you called him a liar . He wants satisfaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said incredulously , " But this is a joke ! " Maestro Arista regarded him steadily in the half-light . " No , son , " he answered . " This is not a joke . This was very carefully planned in the mayor 's office . Do you think the mayor and his German boss came here today because they are interested in sports ? " The American sank back and stared at the ceiling . " What do they want ? " he asked finally . " Ponti gives you two alternatives and a choice . Either to apologize to him before the audience over the loudspeaker , admitting first that you made the statements in the newspaper and then retracting them , or ? " " Or ? " prompted the American at the Maestro 's hesitation . " Or to fight a duel , here and now . " " And the choice ? " " The weapon . " The American laughed . The Maestro put his hand on his shoulder . " That is my message , " he said with something like pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a fool , that I would not permit my fencing room to be used for such an illegal encounter , but they had thought of that too . The mayor came in. pre-MAGAZINE tended to listen to both sides of the case , and decided that Ponti was in the right . He told me that he would take the responsibility before the law and ordered me to bear Ponti 's message to you . " Maestro Arista paused for a moment . When he resumed , his voice was choked with bitterness . " He would not dare do so unless he had advance authority from Rome , even from Berlin . This is a sign . Those criminals are prepared for anything , even war with America . You are to be a sacrifice , an additional provocation , and that little German hyena out there has come to enjoy your death . But you can fool them yet . The two alternatives are not absolute . There is a third . You can get dressed and walk out . I do not think they will stop you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And what would happen to you ? " he asked . The Maestro made a gesture with his hand . " Thank you , but no , " said the American , sitting up and putting his feet on the floor . The Maestro clutched his arm . " Then you 'll apologize ? " " No , " said the American . " I wo n't do that either . They know I ca n't , and so do you . Gently , Maestro , you are stronger than you think . " Maestro Arista released his arm . He said , almost wistfully , " If they would let me I would take your place . For all my years I could still ? " He broke off and awkwardly stroked the American 's hair in a curious paternal gesture . He said , " At least I can make sure that you get fair play . I will make them let Ubaldini direct . With your permission I will be your second . " " Thank you , " the American said gratefully . " He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force through your parries . Shall I say epee ? " " As you wish , Maestro . " Arista walked into the other room . III T HE parley in the Maestro 's office seemed interminable to the American , but when they called him out he saw by his watch that only ten minutes had elapsed . Ponti and Donati were seated side by side on a bench , while Maestro Arista sat behind his desk , his hand at his chest . Ubaldini , in the center of the room , said , " Here arc the condi tions . The weapon will be epee , with the button removed , and sharpened . The bout will be fought on the center strip in full view of the audience , which witnessed the provocation and should witness the satisfaction . " The duellists will fight without masks , ; tripped to the waist . The bout will end at first blood , if more than a scratch ; in such a : ase , the decision to continue will rest with ne . If at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be a ive-minute rest , after which the bout will : ontinue for another period of fifteen minttes .

If both periods are lost in the arne way , it will be construed as a full apolgy by the loser , plus the implication of cowrdice . At the end of the second period the out will be over , unless terminated other-rise , and the men will shake hands . " JbaMini looked at Donati . " Have I spoken our mind , Maestro ? " " Precisely , " said Lonati . " And yours , Maestro ? " Ubaldini Lid to Arista . Arista grunted , " My mind is nspeakable . " " Now I speak my mind , " Ubaldini said desively . " I have fought six duels and am ere to brag about them . If either of you 3hts in a way that is not in accordance with : cepted fencing-room practice , he will have answer to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him number seven . This is a civilized untry. - Between set teeth Ponti said , " You smile , mericano ? You do not think we are civilmi ? " " I am not answerable to you for my oughts , " said the American , still smiling . : the same time he thought , Good . I must ake him angry . Ponti shouted , " I will make you smile in other way on the strip ! " " Very well . Save it until then . " " Enough ! " cried Ubaldini angrily . Donati it his hand on Ponti 's arm and said to aaIdini , " Tell them about the team . " " Yes , " said Ubaldini . " The team meet will aceed as scheduled . No. 1 will meet No .

T HE crowd had been growing restless . When Ubaldini appeared and walked to the microphone , they let out a shout , which doubled in intensity when the American and Ponti came out and walked to their respective benches . Ubaldini held up his hand . " The meet will proceed , " he announced . Del Vecchio , foil in hand , stopped by the American in curiosity , " What 's up ? " he asked . The American shook his head , and said , " Go in there and win . " Donati had sent in his No. 2 man in place of Ponti , a slender , left-handed redhead . Both started cautiously , Del Vecchio taking small steps forward with light taps on the blade . The redhead gave ground , trying to deceive the beats . He will stop-thrust from the outside , the American thought . If he relies on that with Del Vecchio , he will lose . Del Vecchio became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension in sixte . The champion swept his blade down with a cross to the low line and scored easily . The judge called it , and Ubaldini , directing , announced one touch for Bologna . The redhead tried to break time again , but Del Vecchio 's attack was given the preference . Marino said to the American , " He will change his game now . " The American nodded . Now the redhead took up the attack . He was fast , and his lunge was long and forceful . Del Vecchio parried twice , without scoring on the riposte ; on the third , the redhead made a 1-2-3 and arrived just above the hip . Del Vecchio nodded and went to the center of the strip . The score was two to one for Del Vecchio , " Bravo ! " shouted Marino , and pounded the American on the back . The redhead had tried the same thing , and Del Vecchio , with an ease that was almost contemptuous , had straightened his arm and arrived to the neck on the march . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is over . " Del Vecchio made the final two points by patiently tracking the baffled redhead to the end of the strip , provoking a desperate stop-thrust by a false attack , and then going in with opposition . The score was five to one , and one bout was chalked up for Bologna . The team welcomed Del Vecchio to the bench with slaps on the back . Maestro Arista arose from where he had been sitting at the other end of the bench , and nodded to the American . They walked into the Maestro 's office , followed by Ponti and Donati , as Ubaldini announced the next bout . The crowd , seeing the men leaving the room and sensing that something was tip , interrupted the announcement with cries and catcalls . Someone cried , " Come back ! " Ubaldini tried several times to make himself heard , and began to get angry . Suddenly a hush fell on the room ; at a word from the little man at his side , the mayor had risen and raised his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned in indignation to the crowd behind them . In the Maestro 's office , Ponti and the American hurriedly pulled off their fencing jackets . The second bout had started . The click of the blades and the scuff of soft shoes on cork were audible through the door , which had been left partially open . Maestro Arista called the two men to his desk , where four epees lay side by side . They were the regulation epees , with large round aluminum bells and grooved blades ; two of them had the Italian crossbar at the handle , while the other two had aluminum pistol-grips . All the pointes d'arr  --  t had been removed , and the tips filed smoothly into sharp points . " First choice to Ferrara , " said Arista . In explanation he said to the American , " You selected the weapon . " Pond picked up both Italian swords , whipped each of them experimentally in turn , and set one down immediately . The American picked up one of the pistol-grips and hefted it . The point seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other was better , and he nodded . At the door Maestro Donati said , " Ferrara 's No. 2 is leading , 4-2 . " Maestro Arista lit a candle and propped it firmly on his desk . As they watched he held each point in the flame for a few moments . Ponti , smiling sardonically , said , " It will not be from infection that he will die . " Donati said , " Ferrara , 5-3 . " He opened the door a little wider . They saw Ubaldini at themicrophone , holding up his hand for silence His face was serious . The room became quiet Ubaldini talked for fully five minutes . He ex plained the incident between Pond and the American , the debate between the seconch the decision to have the duel , and the variou conditions by which the participants ha ( agreed to abide . He warned that there woult be no demonstration from the audience tha might interfere with the contest .

The world na rowed down to an expanse of cork strip , a a lithe catlike figure extending a murdero point at him . All his being rushed to a poll immediately behind his eyes . His though became actions . He is stronger , he is perienced . I must be smarter . Ponti 's broad chest had become a rtarrc line . His arm was almost fully extended .

The American pulled his arm back as Pond 's point slid under his bell , parried it and made an ineffectual riposte toward the body . It was two feet short . Another half-inch and I could have stopped to the arm . But that half-inch . He 's testing me . Do you believe it now ? Yes . I will stake everything on the distance . There is no other way . But not this period . You are not eager enough yet . Pond 's magnificent body crouched still lower . His nostrils flared like a stallion 's . That 's it . Come on , you . Taking tiny steps to match those of his adversary , the American went back . The margin was always there but it grew narrower . That 's too close . Deliberately , the American stepped off the end of the strip , and Ubaldini came between them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laughter ; someone cried , " Coward ! " They are enjoying it . All we need now is lions . So much the better . Egg him on . It all helps . Ubaldini , frowning , said to him , " That 's twice . " This time Ponti opened with more confidence . Perhaps I have misjudged , the American thought . A momentary doubt arose in him . The violence of the attack startled him , set him back on his heels , almost made him release the precious stop that could be used only once . But Pond 's crowding gave him no time to pivot , and some vestige of control let the American hold it back . He weathered the storm , which left him shaken . One more like that and I -- He backed away puzzled . But Ponti 's increased eagerness reassured him , convinced him his plan was right . If only Pond would risk everything on one long attack to the body ! What 's holding him back ? He comes in too close . He wants no risk at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very well , then . For the third time the American stepped off the end of the strip , and Ubaldini stopped Pond 's gliding advance with his cane , and said shortly , " That 's all . Five minutes ' rest . " In fury Ponti cried , " Stay on the strip , vigliacco ! " Ignoring him , the American looked at Ubaldini 's set face . He does n't see it . Good . Perhaps Pond wo n't either . T HEY tossed a towel to the American as he walked to the bench . He draped it around his neck , letting his breath out with a rush and relaxing his taut stomach muscles . Marino and Del Vecchio were regarding the floor between their legs . They were ashamed . Only Maestro Arista regarded him steadily . Mopping his face , the American said , " Will it work , Maestro ? " " You should have done it there at the end , " Arista answered . " They will tell him . " The American followed the Maestro 's eyes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ubaldini did n't see it , " he said .

" Sometime during the first period an additional group of carabinieri had come in . They clustered around the entrance . Their hobnailed shoes sounded ominously on the wooden floor . The American thought , if he kills me they will give him a medal . But if I kill him ? He looked at the little thick-lipped German , who was smiling and nodding at something the mayor was saying . This is a civilized country , Ubaldini said . I wonder what the mayor said . Or what the Duce will say when the news of my death reaches his desk in the form of a neatly typed memorandum , which will distort the facts very glibly and end with a pious reflection on the superiority of the Italian gladiator over the American . The crowd had applauded Ponti as he went to his bench . Now they whispered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " Time , " he said finally . They have told him . The American 's heart sank . Instead of boring in with pressure and changes of engagement , Ponti began a series of beats and counterbeats . His blade moved only a few inches , but at each beat a shock ran up the American 's arm . He could not get his blade out of the way . In desperation he answered the beats with beats of his own , but it was like beating a taut wire . His forearm began to ache . This is dangerous . I am playing his game . If only Perhaps they did n't tell him . Perhaps they told him only to tire my arm . Break time once and see . But to the body . Wait for a counter-beat . Now . At Ponti 's beat to the outside , he used the force to carry his blade under and around and extended with a vic ? ous grunt . It was short , as he knew it would be , but Ponti pulled up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He still wants the body . But with or without a beat ? Every thing depends Without a beat . They did n't tell him .
