If words were to be taken at their face value last week , a lot of them had dirty faces . The lie was freely passed ; the retort discourteous was the rule . Slanderous accusations splattered like eggs . If any citizen could be found last week who believed half of what he heard , he must have been sad indeed . Whichever candidate was elected-if he were to believe his ears-the country was lost . <P> According to Republicans , an irresponsible New Deal , filled with treachery , fostered by corrupt bosses , was making hash of the defense program , dragging the country into war , bankruptcy , dictatorship . According to Democrats , Republicans recklessly and deliberately falsified the record , and Willkie was an evasive trickster , under the thumb of the most corrupting influence in U. S. politics today , the utilities . Examples of extreme partisan bitterness : <P> Cartoonist Percy Crosby ( " Skippy " ) : " The only time I ever shall bend a knee to a third-term impostor will be before a firing squad . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a shameless candidate ... There may be such a thing as a . . decent utility man , but I have never met him . . . . Some men have their hair mussed because their brains are working , others because the photographers are working . " <P> Gene Tunney : " . . . I 'd rather go down to hell with Wendell Willkie than to the White House with Roosevelt . " <P> Dorothy Thompson : " When you vote for Willkie . . . you are voting for Communism . " <P> Thomas E. Dewey : " The third-term movement was conceived in secrecy , nourished on cynicism and reared in arrogance to its ugly maturity by the most corrupt elements of American political life . " <P> But the aspersions of 1940 were not so bad compared to those of past political campaigns . Even the missiles flung at Republican Candidate Willkie gave the 1940 campaign little dirty distinction . A man with a gun was arrested when Willkie spoke at Madison Square Garden , but unlike Roosevelt I , who got a bullet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Willkie was not shot at . <P> The verbal bullets that tore the air in the Roosevelt-Taft-Wilson campaign made 1940 's pot shots sound like popgun plips . <P> Wrote Iron Ore , a newspaper in Ishpeming , Mich. : " According to Roosevelt , he is the only man who can call others liars , rascals and thieves , terms he applies to Republicans generally . . . . Roosevelt is a pretty good liar himself . . . . Roosevelt lies and curses in a most disgusting way ; he gets drunk , too , and that not infrequently , and all his intimates know about it . " ( T. R. sued for libel , asked for nominal damages , got 6 . ) <P> In that campaign , each of the candidates was called insane . Bryan charged that Taft had " pressure on the brain . " A Chicago lawyer offered $5,000 to charity if Roosevelt would submit to an alienist and take the consequences . Woodrow Wilson was not only accused by his political enemies of being insane , but of being syphilitic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
