U.S. businessmen who fear reconversion got a " guinea pig " to watch last week . By studying it they may get a clearer idea of what some of those fears amount to . The guinea pig : the Kelly-Springfield Tire Co. in Cumberland , Md . <P> Because of the rubber shortage , Kelly-Springfield , known in Cumberland as " The Kelly , " was dawdling along under a , skeleton staff 18 months ago . Then The Kelly leased most of its 1,000,000 sq . ft. of plant to the War Department , contracted to turn out small-arms ammunition on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis . Shrewd , handsome Kelly President Edmund Sidney Burke handled the conversion to war production . He stored some of the tire-making machinery in plant buildings , to be handy for the reconversion job which would come some day-no one expected it so soon . Kelly 's payroll skyrocketed under war orders , soon reached an alltime high of 5,000 workers , of whom 2,500 were women . Half of the women had never worked in industry before . <P> The Woman Pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw a pinch coming soon in tiremaking facilities . Last month he hustled to Washington , convinced WPB that it would be wise to cancel the lease and reconvert The Kelly to tires . Other ordnance plants took on The Kelly 's orders , and just 12 days after the deal was made , the first workers were laid off . Within two weeks , the layoffs will jump to 2,000 , will crescendo until , in three weeks , the payroll will be slashed approximately 75% , leaving the basic staff needed to install tiremaking equipment , 1,200 men . On Oct. 1 , The Kelly quits making ammunition , starts on tires . <P> Significantly for U.S. industry , the women will be hit hardest by the change , in Cumberland they will find no cushion to soften the jolt . Few have worked long enough to be eligible for unemployment compensation . In ordnance work , women inspect , gauge , operate automatic machines . But tiremaking is a hard , dirty , heavy job . A mere 300 may eventually get back their jobs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just long enough to buy fur coats on the installment plan , must move away to find jobs , stay at home , join the WACS . <P> The Men Wait . For the men it will be a matter of waiting , with unemployment compensation easing the wait . Within 30 days , bustling Mr. Burke expects to turn out his first synthetic rubber tire . From then on , re-employment will rise steadily until , in six months , the payroll will hit 2,200 ( 2,800 jobs less than the ordnance plant ) . <P> While this rise &; fall in employment is typical of what will happen in thousands of U.S. plants , not typical is the way the company has dodged the horrific bugaboo now raising the hackles of U.S. businessmen-reconversion cost . The Government will foot the bill ( standard practice when it leases a plant ) . With equal ease , the company will dodge smaller bugaboos . It need not scramble for equipment ( WPB will see to that ) , nor fear that some other company will grab its market while it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
