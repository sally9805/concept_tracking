When Political Scientist Benjamin Fletcher Wright of Harvard University was appointed president of Smith College ( TIME , March 21 ) , he had a reservation : he was afraid he did not know enough about women 's education . " I 've got to do some homework , " said he . Last week at his inauguration ( which coincided with Smith 's 75th anniversary celebration ) , President Wright showed how far his homework had taken him . He jumped right into the biggest question of all : What should women be educated for ? <P> A liberal education was all right as far as it went , but Wright thought something more needed to be added . Said he : " the place of women in the present scheme of things is confused and unstable . . . We must constantly bear in mind , however , that the great majority of women who attend college will marry and have children , and that for most of them their home will be the focus of their lives . " Neither women students nor their colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so satisfactory a place ... as it should be . " <P> The job of the women 's colleges was clear to Smith 's new president : they must thoroughly investigate " the role of women in contemporary life , " and perhaps change their curricula accordingly . The " older and more firmly established " colleges had been slow to do so . " I can see no justification , " said he , " for allowing the newer and frankly experimental colleges to take the initiative in making the investigations and the trials which may seem to be called for . " <P> Exactly what he intended to do , Wright did not say . Smith expected there were some experiments ahead .
