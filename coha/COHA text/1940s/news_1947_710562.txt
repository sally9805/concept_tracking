txt The United Mine Workers and the Pennsylvania Anthracite operators agreed tonight to contract revisions raising ' the pay of 75,000 hard coal miners by $1.26 a day . This matched the increase in the earnings won by John L. Lewis for the UMW 's soft coal workers . The levy for the welfare and retirement fund also was doubled , making the rate 10 cents a ton . The soft coal miners also re . ceived a reduction in the work day from nine to eight hours , but a different problem was encountered in the anthracite industry , where the basic work day is seven hours . This was not changed . ' The new hard coal rates are $11.09 a day for inside men and $9.40 for outside men , an increase of $1.20 in each case . This amouNts to a rise of 17.1 cents an hour . Weekly earnings of anthracite miners have been slightly below bituminous workers ' income and ranged from about $65 to $69 . The - ' , nrter working day for hard coal , rkers , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher than in the bituminous fields . The anthracite welfare and retirement fund is administered by two representatives of the miners and one of the operators . This was not altered . The Taft-Hartley law requires equal representation , except that this provision is not applicable until a contract expires or Iran July 1 , 1948 , whichever occurs first . Inasmuch as the anthracite con- tract did not expire but was merely amended , the parties decided that a change in the fund administra- I tion was not necessary at this time . The revision of the thirteenmonth-old anthracite agreement without even recourse to the thirty-day notice provisions probably set a speed record in coal negotiations . The fact that union officials and operators had met was kept secret until the agreement was announced . A joint statement said : " The prompt adjustment of the existing anthracite agreement through collective bargaining is made possible by the completely satisfactory relationship which exists in that industry between the anthracite operators and the United Mine Workers of America and its membership . " The industry during the past year has enjoyed wholesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the successful negotiation of the existing contract in 1946 . " Except for an insignificant part of the soft coal tonnage still to be signed , the anthracite accord ended the annual negotiations of the union . The presumption is that the bituminous and anthracite contracts will continue in force for a year , but they may be opened sooner . UMW officials reported that 98 per cent of the soft coal industry , in terms of output , had accepted ' the new agreement . Truman Refuses to-Comment President Truman refused at his news conference to enter the controversy over the effect of the soft coal agreement , but Senator Robert A. Taft , Republican , of Ohio , said that he did not believe the contract violated the Taft-Hartley I law . Representative Fred A. Hartley Jr. , Republican , of New Jersey , said yesterday that there was one specific violation and others which transgressed the spirit of the act . Mr. Truman tr .. : u a questioner I that he had no comment , and that I the contract was one between the owners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the I Council of Economic Advisers , however , included an appraisal of the possible effects of the soft coal wage rise on the general economy . The Council 's report , covering the general economic situation , will be discussed by the Cabinet tomorrow . Therefwas no promise that it would be made public . The specific violation , of law charged by Mr. Hartley was the contract provision for deduction of union dues , initiation fees and assessments , whereas the law authorizes " dues " deductions only . Mr. Taft , however , - told reporters that " this is only a minor item , " then added that " as far as the employer is concerned , it is up to him to protect himself when he makes a contract . " Earlier , at a hearing before the joint committee on the economic report , B. C. Forbes , publisher of Forbes Magazine , testified that some provisions of the coal contract " strike me as if Lewis and the owners entered into a conspiracy to thumb their noses at the new Taft-Hartley Act . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The theory is that the employers and employes should be able to make any contract they want to in free collective bargaining . " Except for the closed shop and the welfare ' fund provisions with which he believed the United Mine Workers had complied , the Ohioan said , the only question was whether the contract was a " wise economic thing . " The joint committee will concern itself with that , he added . Opposes Curbs on Freedom The Ohioan said that he doubted whether many business men would sign that kind of contract , but he believed that the freedom of employers and unions to make any contract they please was restricted only in certain , special fields . That must be the basis of labor relations , he asserted , unless the Government " is going to run the whole show . " The Senator disagreed with Mr. Forbes that the law was " impotent , " adding : " You are assuming a purpose the law never had . The purpose of the law is not to protect employers but the individual employe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want . " George M. Humphrey , chairman of Pittsburgh Consolidation Coal Company , who helped to negotiate the ' soft coal contract with the UMW , will testify before the com ' mittee next Tuesday . Union headquarters said mean , while , that despite state restrictons on the union shop and checkoff , operators in Virginia , Alabama and even some in Tennessee had signed the bituminous agreement . The Tennessee law , according to some coal industry lawyers , prohibits the mere signing of such a contract . According to the union , operators in Harlan County , Kentucky , Kansas , Colorado , Washington , and some in Tennessee have not accepted the terms .
