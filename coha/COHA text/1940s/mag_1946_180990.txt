One day , nearly 40 years ago , shaggy-haired Hiram Conibear , ex-trainer of the Chicago White Sox , stood on the shore of Lake Washington and cussed through a megaphone , so loud that his University of Washington oarsmen could hear . When parents objected , Conibear confessed : " I have to cuss a little in order to bluff my way along . " Washington 's new crew coach did n't know the first thing about rowing . <P> Conibear read up on physics and experimented at night in his living room with a broom for an oar . He decided that the traditional Oxford style , in which oarsmen put their maximum power at the end of a long layback stroke , was not only unsound but uncomfortable . He taught a short stroke with a " sock " as the blade entered the water ; the men were sitting upright at the end of the stroke , and ready for a quick recovery . In 1917 , Hiram Conibear was killed ( when he fell out of a cherry tree ) but Washington crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last week , for the first time , eastern crews went west to race on Seattle 's Lake Washington . <P> The largest crowd ever to see a sport event in the Pacific Northwest-some 150,000-hardly expected its Huskies to win ( Washington had scuttled crew during the war ) . But Cornell , Harvard , M.I.T. Rutgers and California were all coached by Washington alumni , and used the Coni- bear stroke . Only Wisconsin , which claimed that it trained on Wisconsin cheese and had n't lost a race all year , did not . <P> A sharp wind roughed up the lake as eight shells pulled away . The Husky crew jumped into an early lead , stayed there until the three-quarters mark . Then Cornell , in the sheltered No.1 lane toward shore , stepped up its beat to 37 . Ten powerful strokes pulled the Cornell shell into command ; it held the lead against M.I.T. 's finish-line sprint . Washington 's Huskies came in third . Wisconsin 's heretics also ran .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
