Before a Senate subcommittee came John Alessi , 43 , of Brooklyn . Mr. Alessi , a gaunt , nervous man of Italian descent , drives a truck for New York City 's Sanitation Department . He is the father of three , and wore , fittingly , a white collar in his appearance before the committee , which is investigating " whitecollar " working conditions . He was supposed to be just a minor witness , to illustrate the ponderous cost-of-living figures spread before the committee by C.I.O. president Phil Murray . But Mr. Alessi stole the show . He has had a bad time of it ever since 1929 . Now things are worse , and he wanted the committee to know . Said he : <P> " To understand a sanitation problem you have to understand the work . . . . During the snow period we operate big brooms . A person driving that equipment goes through a very tense period . What I mean is : we have very few windshield wipers to wipe the snow away-have to open the windshield of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that as the broom works , it sweeps the snow in the air and the wind blows it in the cab , and the result is that eight hours of that continuous work , you 'll have icicles running down your eyes and nose and your hands are frozen to that wheel , and that 's what causes the greatest amount of sick rates . The sick rate is terrifically high in the City of New York in the Department of Sanitation . . . . On illness per hundred , Department of Sanitation is 85.5 . " <P> Florida 's Senator Claude Pepper was astounded . Did the witness mean that 85 out of every 100 are ill ? He did , although that is the annual rate . <P> Old Bills . Nebraska 's Senator Wherry wanted to know John Alessi 's total earnings . They totaled $2,320 a year , John Alessi said , but he had a big explanation : <P> " Now what is the economic situation at home ? I tell you we have none . We do n't know what it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first came on the job in 1928 I was an extra man which they considered extra . Well , they were only paying for the time you worked . . . . Now I was an extra man for about 21 months , and in 21 months that I went through this deal I figured that maybe now that I 'm a steady man the conditions will be better . Well , I found myself in hock , and when I started being a regular man , I was $600 in debt . Up until today I 'm still in debt that same $600 . It seems I can never peel off any amount of that debt . It seems when I get to a certain extent that something happens which makes it accumulate old bills .
