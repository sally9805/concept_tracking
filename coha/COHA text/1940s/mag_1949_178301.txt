The shrunken modern world still has pockets of mystery . One of the most mysterious is the Dash-ti-Margo ( Desert of Death ) in southwestern Afghanistan , where the summer heat rises to 125 F. , and the sand-laden wind reaches 90 m.p.h . Last week Anthropologist Walter A. Fairservis of New York City 's American Museum of Natural History told how in the midst of Dash-ti-Margo he and two associates had come upon a dead city forgotten by the modern world . <P> Toward sundown one August day Fairservis began to look for a place to camp , and spotted far in the distance what seemed to be a town . As his jeep-borne party headed toward the spot , more &; more mud-brick buildings rose into view above the horizon . Shortly they stood before an imposing ruin whose walls surrounded an area of at least 30 square miles , whose buildings must have housed and served a population of 100,000 . <P> With mounting amazement , the anthropologists drove through the silent streets between crumbling mosques , forts and palaces . They found no footprints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever entered the place . The only living creature they saw was a desert viper . <P> Sudden Departure . For eight thirsty days Mr. Fairservis and his companions explored the dead city , collecting domestic utensils ( knives and pottery ) from mud-walled kitchens . In many of the buildings the roof-timbers were still in place . Apparently the city had not been burned or otherwise damaged by invaders . It seems to have been abandoned peacefully and rather suddenly . To judge by the architecture , its last inhabitants were Moslems , but certain decorative details show Greek influence . Mr. Fairservis hopes that its ruins may hide Greek manuscripts preserved by the dry climate . <P> The city 's nearest neighbors , a handful of primitive tribesmen , know almost nothing about it and avoid it in superstitious fear . They call it Peshawarun , and believe it was abandoned centuries ago when invaders cut the irrigation ditches bringing water from the mountains . The inhabitants fled 700 miles northeast , locals claim , to found the city of Peshawar . <P> Dry Wells . Anthropologist Fairservis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its water not from.distant mountains but from many now dry wells , 60 feet deep , inside the walls . He thinks that a river changed its course , lowering the water table and making the city uninhabitable . <P> Mr. Fairservis guesses roughly that the city , unlisted on maps or by historians , so far as he knows , died " about the time of the Crusades " ( 11th to 13th Centuries A.D. ) . Next summer he intends to go back with a staff of archeologists , to give the city its correct ancient name and its place in the stream of history .
