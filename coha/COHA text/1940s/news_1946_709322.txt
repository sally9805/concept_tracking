txt Today is a double anniversary . It is just ten years since Hitler marched into the de-militarized Rhineland , thus breaking an essential clause of the Treaty of Versailles . It is just one year since Lieut . Emmett J. Burrows of this city led the first platoon of Company A of the Twenty-seventh Armored Infantry Battalion of the Ninth Armored Division of the American First Army across the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen . Lieutenant Burrows had the luck to be in at a decisive moment in history . The Rhine had not been crossed by an army in action invading from the west since Napoleon went over in 1805 . General Eisenhower called Remagen " the most beautiful bridge in the world . " The dash , courage and good fortune that captured it ten minutes before it was to be blown up shortened the war , saved many lives and sealed the doom of the vile adventurer who had sent his troops across from east to west in 1936 . A year ago today Marshal Zhukoff 's First White Russian Army was also crossing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles of Berlin . The Allied lines in the West and the Russian lines in the East , as measured at the end of the week , were 335 miles apart . Hard fighting was ahead . Many of the veterans who triumphantly crossed the Rhine and the Oder were destined to fall before victory came . A year ago there was , as there is today , a problem of the Western Allies and Russia getting together . The problem a year ago was solved on April 25 , 1945 , when an American patrol walked into the Russian outposts at Torgen on the Elbe . This double anniversary gives perspective . Ten years saw the rise and the total obliteration of the military power of Nazi Germany . They saw the pitiful collapse of Mussolini 's empire and of the feudal war lords of Japan . They saw a slow awakening of the American people to a terrible danger and e. majestic exertion of armed force that destroyed that danger . But the ten months since the surrender of Germany , the less than seven months since the surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so mournful and foreboding that a hermit unacquainted with the facts might think this country and its allies had suffered a disastrous defeat . The First Army 's dash for the Remagen Bridge is not paralleled by anything that is going on today . We stand on the banks of a wide river , we see no bridge , and some of us are afraid . There is no need for fear if the issue is boldly and honestly faced on both sides of the river , in Russia as well as among the Western democracies . There can be understanding , not in the sense of a weak compromise but in a mutual appraisal of necessities . As of today the Russians appear to wish to take more than Britain and the United States think it proper or just to yield . Mr. Churchill laid the situation out on the map on Tuesday in his Fulton speech , and our own State Department added a word about Manchuria and Iran . There is an issue , and it is dangerous . A conference between the heads or Foreign Ministers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of agreement , beyond which lies the No Man 's Land of overlapping claims . Britain and the United States wish to hold , not to take . Russia is the expanding Power , adding land , goods and authority to her existing store . But we have to believe , as Mr. Churchill does , that there are limits beyond which Russia will not go . The problem is to ascertain those limits , to see how they would fit into the boundaries of a just and peaceful world , and to convince Russia of the wisdom of contracting them where they will not fit . It was folly a year ago to talk of ail ultimate victory for Germany . and Japan . It is a madder folly today to talk of an ultimate war . We do not know what sort of talk is going on today in the Russian fog . If it is talk of art armed conflict , it is not of a piece with the cool and practical nature of Russia 's leaders , as we conceive o them . If we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to proceed on thi assumption . We have to make it plat that we intend to stand for the-princi pies in which we believe , but that w think it practicable for the two grea world systems to exist without conflic side by side . The river is wide , but bridge can be built .
