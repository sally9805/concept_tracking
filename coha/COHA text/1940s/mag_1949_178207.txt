Around 9:30 one night last week , an old gentleman in evening clothes opened the door of a Manhattan hotel ballroom and started to make his way inside . At once , the 1,500 banqueters rose from their tables , and the room rocked with applause . Educator-Philosopher John Dewey nodded his white head , smiled behind his scraggly mustache as scholars and eminent professors clapped until their hands ached . Then everyone joined in a chorus of " Happy birthday to you . . . " <P> The ballroom guests were not alone in celebrating John Dewey 's 90th birthday . Messages had poured in from all over the world-from President Harry Truman and Prime Minister Clement Attlee , from Pandit Nehru , Historian Arnold Toynbee , Harvard 's President James B. Conant and from a hundred U.S. colleges and universities . A dozen foreign nations had planned celebrations . Friends were raising $90,000 for an educational Dewey Birthday Fund . Gruffed John Dewey when a reporter asked him what he thought of it all : " I keep thinking it 's a damned funny thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> To the thousands who celebrated the day , it did not seem funny at all .

His father , the proprietor of a grocery store ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a courtly man with a flowing beard , who quoted Milton and Robert Burns , and told of bullets whistling through his hair during the Civil War ( " I always thought that that was how he got bald , " says Dewey ) . <P> In spite of his shyness , young John did well at school , and at 15 was ready to enter the University of Vermont . There he fell in love with learning , borrowed $500 from an aunt and set off for the six-year-old Johns Hopkins University for more study . " Do n't be so bookish , " Hopkins President Daniel C. Gilman warned him ; " get out and see more people . " But John stuck close to his books ; he had made up his mind to become a professional philosopher .
