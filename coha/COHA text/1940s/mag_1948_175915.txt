Since Easter , Finance Minister Douglas Charles Abbott and his technical experts had worked long &; hard on the budget . With Prime Minister King 's O.K. , Abbott laid down the general line : a tough plan , and no major tax reductions . <P> It was far different from a year ago , when Doug Abbott , passing out tax-reduction gifts ( TIME , May 12 , 1947 ) , looked like Santa Claus . Since then the price situation had worsened . So had the international outlook . Doug Abbott had toughened with the times . He was no longer a patient listener . Many a time in budget conferences he cut short advisers with a brusque yes or no and hurried to the next item . Even with colleagues of Cabinet rank he had lost the habit of turning aside importunities with easy banter . <P> Flat &; Toneless . When budget night came , External Affairs Secretary Louis St. Laurent moved into Abbott 's seat to let the Finance Minister have the front-row place of honor next to the P.M. The House was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read his 14,000-word speech . As he recited the hard facts of the nation 's financial life , his voice got flat and toneless . More &; more M.P.s left the chamber for a smoke . <P> " Canadians , " said Abbott , " are realists . We do not expect to get something for nothing . " In that belief , he had given them a completely realistic budget . Though " we have stopped the abrupt decline in our exchange reserves , " said he , and " our domestic economy has continued to boom . . . the general policy for this year should be to use our surplus $670 million to reduce our debt and thereby to fight inflation . . . " The nation should get set for an economic slump , and be ready for an international emergency . " A substantial surplus will help to keep our powder dry . " <P> Budget highlights : <P> No reduction in personal income taxes except for people over 65 . They get an added exemption of $500 , or a total of $1,250 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8% commodity tax comes off canned fruit , fruit juices , vegetables , soup , fish , meats and poultry , breakfast cereals , spaghetti , macaroni and wheel chairs . This will cost the government $20 million a year , may save the consumer as much as $30 million . <P> The 25% sales tax comes off silver plate and watches with Braille dials ( of which 300 were sold in Canada last year ) . <P> Amusement taxes of 20% and 25% and the 5% tax on pari-mutuel betting are abandoned , at a cost to the Dominion of $23 million annually . ( At least three of the provinces will impose similar taxes to fill their own tills . ) <P> Succession ( inheritance ) taxes will be laid only on estates of $50,000 ( instead of $5,000 ) and up , thus exempting 90% of them . <P> Hope Deferred . Canadians , knowing there was a whopping Treasury surplus , had hoped for more , but active resentment was confined to the professional opposition . Most Canadians knew that Abbott 's budget , though tough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Ottawa cynic who cracked : " You have to be blind , over 65 or dead to get anything . "
