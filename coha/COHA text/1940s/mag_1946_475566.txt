THE infant prodigy of postwar enterprise in the United States is undoubtedly that determined child known as the " nonscheduled air carrier . " Its business is flying people and other assorted mammals , ranging from prize cows to chimpanzees , from any place to any place at any time ? not to mention juke boxes , sea foods , farm machinery , dresses , orchids , furniture , and fresh strawberries . Even funerals arc taking to the airways . Propelled by the general business boom , many of the world 's finest transport aircraft and an even larger number of exGI 's are now aloft on barnstorming operations which have set the established airlines back on their heels and challenged the authority of the Civil Aeronautics Board . Their wings in the sky have fanned up a controversy which may spectacularly alter the progress of air commerce in the months ahead . At last count , there were 2,370 nonscheduled air carriers based in forty-seven states . They operate nearly as many planes of airline type as are used by the big scheduled lines . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and singleengined craft that accommodate from three to eight passengers , and have many more planes on order . With this excellent , though varied , equipment twenty thousand men and women ? about ninety-two per cent of them veterans ? are carrying a swiftly-growing volume of traffic . To theseventeen scheduled airlines of the industry , now servicing 510 of the larger communities , this unorganized legion of smaller contract carriers looks suspiciously like a dangerous competition . The non-scheduled carriers , some of which own only one airplane , flew more Miami and Palm Beach passengers per day from La Guardia Field during last winter 's resort season than did Eastern Air Lines and National Airlines combined . And this record was made despite the fact that for more than a year the non-scheds have been systematically shunted around at many of the large terminal airports ? conspicuously at La Guardia Field and the Miami International Airport . Now , confronted by new CAB restrictions , the small operators view the prominent airlines and the CAB as a species of Axis forged to protect the interests of big business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Germany and Japan put it this way : " Then we were fighting for our country and lives . Now we 're fighting for our bread and butter , which amounts to the same thing . " The commercial air is stormy these days with the winds of charge and countercharge . Some of the scheduled airlines are thundering about the " wildcat airlines " which threaten their business and property , predicting that " these bootleg outfits wo n't last three months . " Equally vociferous are the non-scheduled operators ' blasts against pressures brought by the " vested interests " to cause the CAB to " regulate " the contract carriers out of business . " We do not desire , " they proclaim , " nor will we permit a reign of terror by any governmental agency under which threats and counter-threats are allowed to cloud the issues at stake ! " The sudden growth of this new business has placed the Civil Aeronautics Board and the big airlines in the position of attempting to lock the hangar door after the planes have flown . How well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of umpire in this controversy will be determined by the wisdom of policies now in the making . II ryk0 UNDERSTAND how these one-horse I airlines sprang into being and how they do business , let us look at a sample case . What follows is a composite of the experience of several ? more typical than the story of any single actual outfit . When Johnny Smith was discharged from the Naval Air Service and came home to Main City in Iowa , he had already made up his mind about a few simple but fundamental things . He wanted to get married , to go into business for himself , and to fly . " I did n't want to set the world on fire , " he explained . " I just wanted to be my own boss in a nice little business without too many responsibilities . " Johnny and a high school friend , Eddie Miller , began to lay plans and then consulted with some pilots in Des Moines . " A charter business , flying passengers and maybe a little express from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like a feasible proposition . So we dragged in a buddy of Eddie 's who had been his crew chief in the Eighth Air Force and was working for TWA in Chicago . " This informal strategy was essentially the same as the plans devised by several thousand other veterans in different parts of the country a year or so ago . In obtaining capital , Johnny , Frank , and Eddie were better off than the average . Eddie 's uncle in Waterloo and two friends of Johnny 's father ( who had excellent connections with the Main Street Trust Company ) joined with the three veterans informing the new corporation , " Iowa Central Airlines , Inc . " From the War Assets Administration regional office in Chicago they got veterans ' priority certificates , information about surplus aircraft , and ? after a wait of nine days ? approval of their application and a credit rating . They went next to the WAA depot on Cimarron Field , Oklahoma City , where the nearest airplanes were stored . With Frank 's crew chief experience to guide them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Basically it was the same plane as the standard twinengine DC-3 airliners . In good condition and fitted with removable seats , it was a better buy than the C-47 cargo planes available for some $2,000 less . A down payment of $3,375 closed the deal , and the remainder , plus interest , was to be paid off to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in twelve monthly installments of $1,670.50 . Insurance coverage for the twelve months at three-and-a-half per cent cost $674.62 in cash . The boys got into the air with their new plane for the first time on the way from Oklahoma City to a Wichita " conversion center , " where two more weeks of work and $1,400 went into fitting out the ship in accordance with Civil Air Regulations for commercial flying . Sporting a certificate of airworthiness , they ferried the plane home to the Main City airport . Meanwhile the Main City Advocate carried small , carefully worded advertisements to the effect that Iowa Central Airlines was offering a plane " of airline type " for charter trips anywhere , for any reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We might have got into trouble even before we took off , " Johnny said , " because the Civil Aeronautics Board says nonscheds have to watch out for ads resembling those of the big lines . " ICA carried its first payload , consisting of three local business men , their luggage , and four large cartons of hardware , to Keokuk ? flying time one hour and fifteen minutes . Johnny and Eddie had to " deadhead " back with an empty airplane burning nearly as much fuel and oil as on the revenue trip down . I t took a few more deadheads back to Main City from Dubuque . Council Bluffs , Sioux City , and Des Moines to teach the boys the truth of the old barnstormer 's adage : " You 've got to fill up the airplane , leave the air outside to fly on . " Within two months , the C-49 with ICA on its wing was in the air every day , and everybody but the bank on Main Street was certain that the boys had a going concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payroll at $100 a week , had agreed to draw only half that amount for the first three months . The few thousand dollars remaining in the till and a good deal of enthusiasm could not permanently obscure the fact that salaries , payments on the plane , and a few items such as gasoline and oil , a new tire , and a new propeller governor were coming out of the operating capital instead of profits . It was Eddie 's uncle who pointed out the necessity of setting up branch offices if ICA was to make money out of the people in other Iowa towns who needed to move themselves or their products in a hurry . Before Iowa Central was four months old , the line had stretched out across the borders into three neighboring states , with business in Omaha , Chicago , and Milwaukee . A rush order for medical supplies in Rochester brought Minnesota within ICA 's flying range . Operating within a three-hundred-mile radius of Main City , the boys were now engaging in interstate commerce and thus heading into some future complications . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Johnny and Eddie , and fortunately Eddie 's uncle as well , that another plane was necessary . They saw also that if merchants and shippers in the circumference cities could be informed when ICA would be around with the plane , they would practically fill up the cargo space with assorted items for delivery along the way during the return trips . The operators might cut the deadheading from 225 to twenty-five miles ? sometimes to nothing . A second plane , leased from the War Assets Administration for $4,000 a year , a pilot named Wesley , and a mechanic named Edgar , joined Iowa Central within a few days of each other . With this expansion came the inspiration that cleared up the knottiest tangle An ... . nIrsann 1.1 1.11- ? T ? - ? nnbeam , " said Johnny . " Why fly anywhere any time ? and have to deadhead even ten or twenty miles ? when we can keep busy and fly a full cargo by flying only between definite points where we can be guaranteed a return load every trip ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is the goal which any nonscheduled air carrier , particularly one specializing in air cargo , must reach if it is to succeed . Then the operator can begin to work with set rates that guarantee a profit ; and he can manipulate the all-important " Ioad factors " in order to keep above the vital sixty-five per cent figure . ( A plane that averages less than sixty-five per cent loaded is unlikely to make money . ) With five more veterans on the staff ? four of them working as desk men in Chicago , Milwaukee , and Detroit ? Iowa Central was in telephone contact with shippers , trucking firms , and manufacturers throughout one of the liveliest commercial areas of the Midwest . Part of the proceeds of an issue of stock floated by ICA for additional working capital went into the purchase of two C-47 's and the leasing of a C-50 and a C-48A . Of this fleet of six ships , ICA used two for passengers only . " There was no more of this business of jerking out scats to haul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way we had to in ship number one . " Iowa Central Airlines was in big business in a small way . It had built its success in the conventional grooves which the nonscheds call " straight operations . " III HERE are a multiplicity of out-of-the1 groove non-scheds , as well , whose colorful operators have given the big airlines some more new ideas and the Civil Aeronautics Board a set of worries for which it has not yet found the solution . The idea of flying customers to the recent National Air Races in Cleveland , a natural for the nonscheds , was developed on methods already worked out for operating chartered flights to many other big sporting events all over the country . Resort Airlines , Inc. , of Southern Pines , North Carolina , in th ; q field when it rarried narties from northern cities to Pinehurst . This type of operation went into high during the Kentucky Derby . New York clients , paying $75 a head , which included fare and a general admission or a clubhouse ticket , simply boarded a Century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way down . Century also flew a number of Louis-Conn fans from points west to New York and included in the fare a $30 ticket . The fact that at least two plane loads were grounded in Pennsylvania and stayed so while Joe grounded Billy may be regarded as one of the minor disappointments of that bout . It was another enterprising non-sched who piloted the first airborne funeral . Nationwide Air Transport Service of Miami Springs , Florida , has chartered several funerals for Florida undertakers in charge of the burials of persons from Minnesota , Ohio , Nebraska , and Illinois . After eight flights of this nature , with the casket in a partitioned forward section and the mourners in rear seats of the plane 's cabin , Nationwide decided to rebuild its DC-3 to transform it into a real flying hearse . F RE1GHT carrying by air began to look more like traditional big business when it went to work for the garment industry . Air Cargo Transport , the oldest of the freight lines and one of the largest nonscheds ( with fourteen planes and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to merchants in the interior of the country . So profitable have been the results of their educational campaign with manufacturers and retailers of clothes that Air Cargo can now afford to welcome American Airlines into the garment distribution business . H. Roy Penzell , ACT 's president , who happens to be both a pilot and a business man , has said : " They can do the industry , and indirectly , ourselves , a lot of good with the advertising and promotional appeal which they will give to their efforts . " Air Cargo , whose cordial attitude toward the big lines is hardly typical of the non-scheds in the freight industry , has more than a head start ? despite the advantage of government mail subsidies enjoyed by American , TWA , United , Braniff , and other scheduled lines now breakinginto cargo carrying on the side . Among ACT 's contract clients are Macy , Marshall Field , Myer Siegel , Cataline Knitting Mills , and Best &; Company . The key to Air Cargo 's success , according to Penzell , lies in enabling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Street and , at the same time . to cut the costs of delivery . The department store buyer from Omaha who comes to New York in October to buy dresses and suits for the spring openings back home used to have to gamble on the selling qualities of the merchandise . But now that the dresses and suits can fly overnight to Omaha , the buyers need order only in small lots . If one line of dresses sells , the buyer can re-order immediately and replenish the racks within twenty-four hours . Those lines which leave the customers cold are not heavily overstocked , to be cleared at a loss . Moreover , Penzell has explained , " The dresses and suits are delivered on the very same hangers on which they were originally placed back in New York . Flung in bags and carried by truck , plane , and truck again , they reach the store 's rack without a wrinkle . Costs of packing and unpacking , pressing , and cleaning are eliminated . " This adds up to a saving of from eight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for suits . ACT flies a 6,500-pound shipment of dresses ? door-to-door ? from New York to Los Angeles for seventeen cents a garment ; to Chicago for five cents ; or to Dallas for nine cents . Insurance costs also go down with the saving of time . Penzell figures that all of these factors will hold , indeed will count more heavily , when production has overcome present clothing shortages and customers can demand more consideration for their preferences . How far the non-scheds may go in personalizing delivery service to individual buyers who can pay for it is indicated by the enterprise of a New York designer who furnished and decorated four rooms of a new house in Longview , Texas , last July , bringing in by air a load of Regency furniture . The designer , ex-AAF officer William Pahlmann , with an assistant , climbed into one of the Slick Airways ' big Commando transnnrts. kent an eve nn the carefully crated cargo , and personally supervised the installation . OF ALT , the luxury trades , the flower business has capitalized most successfully on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours is a lifetime to many of the most prized species of flowers . The speed of air transport can often increase the value of the florists ' stock as much as seventy-five cents a dozen and iron out the heart-breaking fluctuations in the market . Many nonscheds are now flying flowers from Florida to large Northern and Midwestern cities ; from Florida to California ( apparently , the more you have , the more you want ) ; from California to the East Coast . Lobsters and other perishable sea foods come to Midwest and Southwest markets by wing from Maine to Maryland . Out-ofseason fruits and vegetables , ripened on Southern trees and vines , can fly to distant cities . With these marketing innovations , new packaging devices , which dispose of heavy rinds , stalks , and leaves , have been invented to increase the payloads of the planes . Helicopter Air Transport , Inc. , of Philadelphia , is the first company to offer helicopter service for chartered and commuting trips . The company has just taken delivery on the first of three Sikorsky S-51 four-place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran operator , Lew Leavitt , who flew the mail in an autogyro from the Philadelphia post office roof to Camden Airport in 1935 . HAT is contemplating mail service within the near future and may , therefore , leave the nonscheduled classification . One of the many women in the nonscheduled business has introduced novelties in her passenger service which have attracted the attention of the larger lines . Terry Air Transport , a one-plane outfit , organized by Mrs. Florence Terry , flew the Florida route last winter and is now operating between New York and New England . Besides murals in the cabin of her Lodestar , Mrs. Terry has experimented with other devices for the diversion of the passengers . The stewardess hands the customers " Terrygrams "  - -  containing notification of the plane 's altitude , airspeed , and weather conditions ? with a blank space where they can write in their estimates of arrival time at destination . The passenger with the closest guess receives a bottle of champagne at the airport . But the non-scheds arc not indulging in stunts for the fun of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they look with suspicion on newcomers in the field who are less dependent than they are on profit . For example , one hundred students and faculty members of the University of Texas are stockholders in a $100,000 non-profit corporation called the University of Texas Air Service , Inc . This organization offers public service but remains within the " fixed-base " category by supplying flight instruction and weather information . In Cleveland , the Ohio Tool Company has formed the OTCO Air Service at the adjacent municipal airport to offer public charter service with a small Stinson and a Lodestar transport . The latter was used as a company plane during the war , often to fly tools to distant war plants ; the peacetime slowdown inspired the idea of putting the plane back to work . It is the subsidiary character of these ventures which disturbs the non-scheds . " Canada has the right idea , " remarked one of the Iowa Central operators . " Their Air Transport Board does not permit institutions or companies to use their aircraft commercially , other than for company affairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognizance of the fact that it was the non-scheds and bush pilots who really founded Canadian aviation . The two scheduled Canadian lines have to have special approval to fly off their routes into areas serviced by nonscheduled outfits . " IV s-r-snu non-scheds were hauling a cargo 1 of worries from the outset but it was by no means an over load until , last May , the Civil Aeronautics Board released its Docket 1507 -- Investigation of Non-Scheduled Air Services , a set of proposed government regulations which would limit their operations severely . To many independents the explosion was a " barrage of legal flak aimed at shooting out of the sky everybody but the big airlines ! " If not immediate grounding , for most of them it meant slow death by restriction . The non-scheds are still in the air at this moment only because Docket 1501 and some other regulatory measures , are not yet law . And the fact that CAB will hold new hearings this month is due entirely to the pressure which the non-scheds have been able to direct at the Board . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations is a limitation on interstate commerce . Non-scheds have been exempt , by law , from the economic regulations which govern other interstate carriers such as railroads , bus lines , trucking outfits , and scheduled airlines . The CAB 's amendment of this exemption would limit the non-scheduled operator to ten round trips per month between any two designated points , such as Des Moines and Chicago , and curtail , almost to the point of prohibition , information to the public concerning the nature and frequency of services . " We just ca n't stay afloat on ten trips a month , " an Iowa Central operator put in . " We have been making four or five trips a week between Sioux City and Chicago , and they 're not scheduled . Sometimes we fly on four or five consecutive days ; sometimes every other day ; somesometimes only Monday and Saturday . It all depends on the shippers ' requirements . Now we 'll have to cancel our contracts and draw up more limited ones . Even if this is all right with the shippers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commercial aviation , non-scheduled carriers have welcomed the new and more stringent safety regulations which became effective August 1 . Non-scheds have consistently conformed with such requirements as the licensing of planes , periodic inspections and overhauls , and the commercial licensing of pilots . While there are still a few " wildcatters " and fly-by-nights ? as in any other business ? most of these have already suffocated . The safety record of the non-scheds in two years of operation is even better than that of the big scheduled lines in the same period , with only three serious accidents to date . And this excellent showing was achieved through their own sense of MAGAZINE responsibility , since they operated under little or no CAB or CAA control . The non-scheds have put up little opposition to another new requirement under which each company must file with the CAB certain information concerning corporate structure , equipment , present and proposed services , traffic figures , and revenue . Indeed , according to some operators , the CAB should have collected and digested this information before they proposed their regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago when few of the non-scheds were yet in business . In this controversy , the government 's position is that the sudden postwar growth of the non-scheduled operations from what amounted to fixed-base barnstorming to near-airline proportions makes necessary a change in regulations . The basic contention of the CAB and of the scheduled lines is that the scheduled carriers should enjoy the same protection against independent operators as they do against other scheduled lines . Present regulations require scheduled lines to obtain CAB approval for duplicate , parallel service over routes already approved for another line . To this the non-scheds reply that equitable protection is certainly not arguable ; but that it ought not to work one-sidedly . They say the non-scheds have no protection against the entry of the big lines into the cargo field . Well heeled with mail subsidies and certain less tangible advantages , the big lines might well come to dominate the service which the nonscheds pioneered . Bob Prescott , president of National Skyway Freight Corporation ( The Flying Tiger Line ) reports that the Flying Tigers were denied the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was needed for passenger traffic . " Yet , " Prescott adds , " American ( Airlines ) put thirteen of these C-54 's into freight hauling in direct competition with me , while the public is required to wait three to five weeks for passenger reservations ! " The non-scheds have plenty to say about the discrimination practiced against them at the big airports . Last winter their Florida-bound passengers had to reach La Guardia Field by whatever means they could devise , and they had to carry their own luggage -- porters are instructed to carry only the bags of scheduled airline guests . The non-scheds have no ticket office , crews ' quarters , or lockers , and would have no place in which to check in passengers but for the benevolence of Shell Oil , which has permitted them joint use of a small waiting room . Nearly all nonscheduled carriers are denied use of the hangars and are compelled to park their craft on the field . They have no access to the public address system to announce flights or to page errant passengers . Pressure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities arc public property . Furthermore their landing fees are acceptable coin for the city . The situation is improving now ? partly because most of the non-scheduled carriers have found conditions better in Newark and Teterboro in New Jersey ; partly because there is less congestion at La Guardia since these thirty-five operators have departed ; and partly because everyone concerned is beginning to appreciate the sincerity and business sense of these veterans . Construction will start soon on a new hangar at La Guardia which is designed to provide space for planes and offices for the joint use of the independent operators . Forced to get wise even in infancy , the non-scheduled operators have banded together in representative groups all over the country . The largest of these , the Institute of Air Transport , recently sponsored full-page ads in the New Tork Times and Washington Past entitled , " Why Throttle Us ? " with a sub-head , " Keep ' Em Flying . " A coupon was included for readers to sign and mail to the CAB supporting the non-scheduled operators ' position on the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried by the non-scheds . This declaration advocated also Six Freedoms for the independent operator : ( 1 ) freedom to fly as many trips as traffic will hear between points not regularly served by air transport systems , ( 2 ) freedom to solicit general business , ( 3 ) freedom to advertise flight information , ( 4 ) freedom to disseminate information to the public about services available , ( 5 ) free.dom to engage in international operations , and ( 6 ) freedom to fly a maximum of twenty round trips a month or five hundred hours , whichever is greater , between any two points regularly served now by other air transportation systems as a needed supplementary service . The non-scheds sometimes have to answer the query of the layman : why not simply get permission to fly certain routes on schedule ? The answer is that " permission " involves getting the CAB to issue a certificate of " convenience and necessity . " The cost of preparing an exhibit for the required public hearing ranges from $20 , 000 to $200,000 , with no guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And action on these applications sometimes takes years . Wichita Falls Air Transport 's application is still pending at this writing for routes in the Southwest applied for December 4 , 1939 . Yet , with the October hearings on Docket 1501 in prospect , the non-seheds dare to look with hope to the future . They place confidence in the fairness of the new CAB chairman , Dr. James M. Landis , former Dean of the Harvard Law School , and they have had help from Secretary of Commerce Henry A. Wallace , who has filed a statement with the CAB urging reconsideration of the restrictions . " Our strongest point will be our great success , " the non-scheds argue . " If the public did n't need us , we would n't be doing so well . " THE future of the non-scheduled air I carrier is probably as unpredictable as was its sudden growth . Even if the CAB decides to open the hangar door , there will be economic factors which will influence the business in ways which the non-scheds themselves do not now recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators will sell out to more successful rivals or will pool resources with others in order to keep afloat . Competition and the location of markets may gradually bring some more clearly discernible operating patterns . The heaviest traffic today suggests possible north-and-south orbits east of the Mississippi , similar patterns throughout the Midwest , coast-to-coast
