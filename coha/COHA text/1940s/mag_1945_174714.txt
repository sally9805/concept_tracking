If heat can sterilize a bottle and a surgical instrument , why ca n't heat sterilize a man ? A scientist who thought up this murky question , and has been brooding over it , is Biologist Raymond B. Cowles of the University of California at Los Angeles . <P> Dr. Cowles began by asking himself : why did the dinosaur become extinct ? Dismissing the usual theories ( the dinosaur 's unwieldy size , an increase in the earth 's carbon dioxide , etc . ) Dr. Cowles decided that it was much more likely that dinosaurs simply perished of a declining birth rate-just stopped breeding during an interglacial heat wave . Last week he was ready to document his theory that there is a definite relation between heat and male fertility . <P> For reasons which biologists do not clearly understand , male sperm is extremely sensitive to heat , is quickly destroyed even at body temperature . In many animals ( notably man ) , sperm is protected by a special cooling system in the scrotum which keeps it at 2 to 15 below normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rabbits , cats and bulls by artificially heating their testes ; Australian sheep breeders recently reported that a sterile breed of rams became fertile when a thick growth of wool on their testicles was sheared off . <P> Dr. Cowles noted that the English sparrow apparently mates only during the cool early morning hours when its body temperature drops below normal . The garter snake rarely breeds in summer . <P> Dr. Cowles reasoned that the unadaptable dinosaur , lacking a cooling system , became sterile during a cycle of warm weather . To test his theory , he tried heat treatments on a descendant of the dinosaur , the night lizard ( Xantusia vigilis ) . <P> A week in a 97 climate made the lizards sterile for a whole season ; 100.5 sterilized them permanently . <P> Avoid the Noonday Sun . All this , thinks Dr. Cowles , may be a warning to man . He cites the fact that high fever sometimes causes temporary human sterility . A 1943 survey in Galveston , Tex . showed that the rate of conception of babies is higher in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the fertility of white men is greatly reduced in the tropics , and even natives conceive fewer children in the hot months . Dr. Cowles believes it entirely possible that a sustained cycle of hot climate on the earth might radically change or even wipe out the human race . <P> Much the same conclusions were reached independently at almost exactly the same time by a London scientist , H. Chapman Pincher , who reported his studies of temperature and male fertility in the British magazine Nature . <P> Tests were made on a group of healthy young men kept in a steam cabinet at 110 Fahrenheit for half an hour . After 18 days , their sperm counts fell well below the minimum for fertility , and they remained sterile for 67 days . Dr. Pincher , following up this study , investigated hospital and domestic bath temperatures which range from 105 to 110 . Putting two &; two together , he suggested that the modern hot bath habit may be largely responsible for the declining birth rate in " civilized " countries .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
