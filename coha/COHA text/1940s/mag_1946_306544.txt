Modern man has developed innumerable devices for blowing himself up , giving himself bad eyesight , high blood pressure , flat feet , nervous indigestion , and ossification of the brain . He has produced an atom bomb and a panty girdle , the vitamin pill , the comic book , the subway gum machine , the soap opera and the revolving door . But in the minds of thousands of New Yorkers all of these achievements pale when compared to the Fifth Avenue bus . <P> Despite its elephantine proportions , the double-decked bus was designed for a purely hypothetical race of men with an average weight of 98 pounds and an average height of 5 ft. in . A normal man can not stand in one without getting his hat knocked off , or assuming a stooped posture , not unlike that of an Oriental criminal awaiting the headsman 's ax . <P> Oops ! When-by virtue of guile , luck or the dexterity of an acrobat-he gets a seat , he immediately becomes conscious of another startling fact . The seats are too small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamps once exerted on the necks of photographers ' victims . <P> The buses have other peculiarities . Above stairs , smoking is not only permitted , but virtually mandatory . On humid summer days the atmosphere is often as rich as that of an opium hell . The entrance doors are miracles of cunning engineering-folding contraptions capable of snapping like bear traps , and edged with rubber to convey the impression that they are incapable of decapitating the unwary . <P> Irascible as Manhattan 's bent and pleated bus-riders often are , they can never hope to match the irascibility of Fifth Avenue 's ancient , turtle-blooded drivers and conductors . <P> Years of jamming buses through Manhattan traffic have given many a driver ulcers , a sulphurous vocabulary , the voice of a mule skinner and a wild ambition to drive the whole route without stopping . None ever make it , but all pass up wind-chilled passengers with maniacal glee . On a slushy winter morning a good driver , as he speeds past , can hit as many as a dozen fist-flourishing bystanders with the spray from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 10 fares has given many a conductor the temperament of a yegg ; most ram their nickel-plated , jingling coin-collectors at the entering passenger 's belly like a gunman wielding a .45 . <P> To many a bruised New Yorker , the Fifth Avenue bus has represented the apogee of progress , the point beyond which even Western Civilization could not go . But last week they knew better . Open-topped buses ( from which it was sometimes possible to catch a few breaths of air only mildly tinctured with exhaust fumes ) were being removed from service . Other double-deckers were being made into one-man conveyances-drivers would have to make change as well as buck traffic , and could be expected to get more apoplectic . And new , elongated single-decked buses were being introduced , thus forcing passengers to elbow harder and longer than ever to be digested and , finally , expelled .
