Radioactive tracers , which have revolutionized medical and biological research , are now going to work in industry . This week Arthur D. Little , Inc. of Cambridge , Mass , told how it used the tracer technique to solve a steel problem . <P> Steel manufacturers know that sulphur ( an undesirable impurity ) gets into steel from the coal used as fuel . But there are two types of sulphur in coal : organic and " pyritic " ( iron sulphide ) . Republic Steel Corp . wanted to know whether either type is driven off when the coal is made into coke . There was no handy chemical way to find out , but the Little Co. ' s scientists worked out a tracer technique that did the job quickly and easily . <P> They made a small amount of pyrites containing radioactive sulphur and mixed it with a coke-oven charge of coal . They roasted the coal and measured the radioactivity of the sulphur remaining in the coke . A very low level of radioactivity would indicate that most of the pyritic sulphur had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A higher level would show that the organic sulphur had been eliminated , leaving behind the pyritic sulphur . Actually , the radioactivity of the sulphur fell between the two extremes , showing that both forms of sulphur stay behind in the coke . The experiment proved to Republic Steel that there is no advantage in using coal that is low in one type of sulphur and high in the other . <P> The Little Co. sees a bright future for tracers in industry . They can be used to measure the infinitesimal amount of lubricant applied to textile fibers , or to estimate the ghost-thin film of metal rubbed off a shaft when it revolves in its bearings . No quantity of material is too small to carry telltale sparks of radioactivity . <P> It wo n't be long , the chemists think , before radioactive tracers are used to control industrial processes . Bessemer converters , for instance , burn impurities out of molten iron with a blast of air . Usually the phosphorus is the last impurity to go . The Little scientists propose that a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it ( and the ordinary phosphorus with it ) has been burned out of the steel , automatic instruments will note instantaneously the drop in radioactivity . Then the air blast can be shut off at exactly the right moment .
