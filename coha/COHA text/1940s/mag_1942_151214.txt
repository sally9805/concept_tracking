The face of Paris , so ageless and radiant in the years of freedom , is that of a gnarled and brooding old lady under the Nazis . The city was in no mood for a facelifting last week , but it had started to get one . The Germans were tearing down buildings in St. Germain des Pres , St. Gervais , Le Marais , the Palais Royal and the Halles ( central markets ) . Except St. Germain , all these quarters belong to the old inner Paris , walled and fortified at the end of the 12th Century by Philippe Auguste , the powerful king who conquered Normandy and pushed his authority past feudal nobles to all the frontiers of his realm . The first church of St. Germain was built in the meadows by Childebert I in the 6th Century , when Paris was a Roman island in the river . In the Palais Royal the great Cardinal Richelieu died and Louis XIV shone like the sun . Across the river Margaret of Burgundy met the lovers whom she was said to have silenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is caught in the web of streets where the Nazis last week stolidly laid waste-in preparation , it was said , for a rebuilding job designed by no less an architect than Adolf Hitler . A brave letter appeared in Figaro : " Paris , which in June of 1940 miraculously escaped trial by fire and the horror of destruction , is unexpectedly menaced by new destruction . " The letter was signed by a group of intellectuals and painters , including Jean Giraudoux , Paul Valery , Paul Morand , Jean Cocteau , Andre Derain . The man in the street , passing the wreckers at work , simply muttered : " Regardez-moi ces assassins , " and looked , as he seldom looked in the years of freedom , at the soaring crags of the Eiffel Tower , which the Nazis had threatened to tear down for the sake of its steel .
