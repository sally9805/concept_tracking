Last week at Lake Success , Russia 's Gromyko made incandescently clear what should have been understood long ago : Russia fears real international control of atomic energy more than she fears The Bomb itself . Gromyko 's speech ended hope of genuine internationalization of the atom , even though some atomic convention may yet be signed . <P> Vicious &; Unacceptable . For nine months Russian and U.S. delegates to the Atomic Energy Commission and the U.N . Security Council have weaved through a maze of procedural and technical arguments . The U.S. press and public got the idea that the two countries were not far apart on the basic question of whether the atom should be controlled . Behind this U.S. error lay the assumption that Russia , lacking The Bomb now and the industrial capacity to compete with the U.S. in future manufacture of it , would find control preferable to inferiority . But the men who make Kremlin policy , tougher-minded than Americans think , apparently did not reason that way . <P> Moscow chooses competition because it does not regard U.S. possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think the U.S. will use The Bomb unless a complete clash between the U.S. and Russia occurs . Any crisis that would lead to such a clash would be of Russia 's making , and Moscow could always back down and cool off the crisis in time . Meanwhile , the Russians will continue their efforts to get enough atomic bombs . <P> Only on the basis of such reasoning is Gromyko 's speech comprehensible . He knows that international inspection and control of atomic materials presupposes a limitation on national sovereignty . His main argument against the U.S. plan is that it infringes upon the state sovereignty of every nation ( as indeed it does , and as every real control plan would ) . Gromyko was even more violent in his attack on proposals for international development of atomic power for peaceful purposes . He called them " thoroughly vicious and unacceptable , " and said : " The Soviet Union . . . can not allow that the fate of its national economy be handed over . . . . " <P> There it is . Gromyko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tosses around glittering dust in the form of proposals to " outlaw " The Bomb ( a la Kellogg-Briand ) . <P> The Implacable Struggle . On the atomic bomb , as on every other vital issue , Moscow is governed by Lenin 's dictum : " Victory over the bourgeoisie is impossible without a long , persistent , desperate life and death struggle : a struggle which requires persistence , discipline , firmness , inflexibility and concerted will power . " <P> In the light of that , Gromyko 's speech makes sense . <P> U.S. Delegate Warren Austin , however , preferred not to discuss Gromyko 's speech in that light . In his reply , Austin defended U.S. motives , kicked the procedural issue around gently , and wound up hoping that " the next report " ( in September ) of the Atomic Energy Commission would move the world closer to " the establishment of collective security and the development of better living for all . " <P> Apparently , Austin , like a lot of other Americans , had a much brighter view of the Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
