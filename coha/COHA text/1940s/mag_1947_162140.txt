For U.N . ' s most dramatic session , Britain 's Palestine proposal provided fresh drama . Now U.N . ' s Assembly delegates settled down to the infighting around Lake Success ' long , oval committee tables . Here , in six main committees and for six days a week , they will spend most of their working time for the next two months . First rounds were raucous . <P> To the Political &; Security Committee went issues like George Marshall 's proposals for a year-round " Little Assembly , " the veto , and independence for Korea , and Andrei Vishinsky 's demand for measures " against propaganda and the inciters of a new war . " Last week the committee waded into the U.S. motion to charge Yugoslavia , Albania and Bulgaria with threatening Greece , and to send an Assembly peace-watch to the Balkans . Cried Andrei Gromyko in good voice : " A Fascist clique is hatching plans for a new war . " <P> The Social , Humanitarian and Cultural Committee found itself listening to Russia 's Valerian A. Zorin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; information , said he , should crack down on the " warmongering " press . He left the Committee a nine-point Soviet resolution to chew on . Meanwhile , Delegate Vishinsky treated some 300 members of the working press to further charges of warmongering . <P> U.N . also heard an important unofficial suggestion this week : to restore the freedom and independence of Yugoslavia , Poland , Bulgaria , Hungary and Rumania . It came from members of the International Peasant Union , including former Hungarian Premier Ferenc Nagy , Bulgarian Opposition Leader Georgi M. Dimitroff , Croatian Peasant Leader Vladimir Macek . <P> The Security Council found time to meet , too . They were called on to decide whether Italy and other former Axis satellites should now be recommended for U.N . membership . Andrei Gromyko said he would not veto Italy this time , provided Bulgaria , Hungary , Rumania and Finland were admitted too . <P> Meanwhile , U.N . membership grew to 57 . The two latest joiners : Yemen and Pakistan . Delegates learned that 1 ) the General Assembly 's special session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over procedure , at an estimated cost ( for salaries , overhead , etc. ) of more than $500,000 ; 2 ) from now on , they would have to do without meat twice a week ( Tuesday and Friday ) if they chose to dine at U.N . eateries .
