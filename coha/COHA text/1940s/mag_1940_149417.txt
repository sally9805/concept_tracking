FAITH FOR LIVING-Lewis Mumford-Harcourf , Brace ( $2 ) . <P> Fear enters Lewis Mumford 's door with the daily newspaper . The last radio report in the evening causes him a living nightmare which slips imperceptibly into the horrors of his sleep . These and other apocalyptic afflictions he describes this week in Faith for Living , 333 pages as hortatory as Isaiah , as alarming as The Book of Revelation . But by implying that every right-feeling man these days must awake with a shriek and a shiver in the dead of night to find himself surrounded by phantom parachutists , he somewhat alienates sympathy for his case . <P> Lewis Mumford is an art critic , a specialist in architecture and city planning at a time when more cities are being destroyed than built . He has written authoritatively about these and other subjects . He is also a militant and vocal liberal , and has en joyed a long connection with The New Republic that ended last June in a hideous rupture ( TIME , June 17 , July 8 ) . When Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly all the symptoms of a flourishing fascism , Mumford denounced Communists . When German , Italian and Japanese Fascists began to burn the cities of Spain and China , Author Mumford blew up with a pop heard round the publishing world . In Men Must Act he demanded complete severance of U. S. diplomatic relations with , complete boycott of , Germany , Italy , Japan . He praised the assassination of Huey Long as a political stitch in time . When New Republicans stirred with embarrassment , but declined to get down from the left end of the liberal fence , Author Mumford loudly parted company with The New Republic . <P> The clearer things became to him , the louder Author Mumford screamed ; the louder he screamed , the more he was po litely disregarded and the more isolated he felt ; the more isolated he felt , the louder he screamed . Faith for Living is his most piercing shriek to date . The book suggests that Author Mumford has been practically overrun by Nazis already and the U. S. will get its turn in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urges total moral regeneration for U. S. liberals . His program embraces three main points : 1 ) restoration of the family ; 2 ) re-establishment of ties with the soil ; 3 ) the development of personality . <P> Says he : " There are three areas , in particular , where a swift renewal of faith and act and deed must take place : these are the areas that have always been lifesustaining , life-preserving , life-forwarding . One is the family . The other is the land . And the third is the self . . . . Without a revamping of our ideas and practices in these areas . . . our efforts to preserve a civilized social order will be feeble and hollow . . . . " How this revamping is to be accomplished , practically under fire , is left somewhat vague , all the more so because Author Mumford. by habit , intention and idiom , addresses his exhortation to the one group in the U. S. which is least capable of acting on it-the liberal intellectuals .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
