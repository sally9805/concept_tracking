txt We have yet to see any one demonstrate how it is possible to continue to increase wages in the face of a growing scarcity of goods without bringing on inflation . Nor have we heard any one contend that inflation is from labor 's standpoint a satisfactory means of achieving " equality of sacrifice . " Yet it is constantly being argued that to restrain wage increases would violate the principle of equality of sacrifice . Elsewhere on this page we publish a letter from a correspondent who defends the demands of the workers in " Little Steel " for higher wages on this ground . He cites as justification for higher wages in " Little Steel " the facts that executives of two of the companies involved received large increases in remuneration last year and the profits of the companies have increased . From the standpoint of combating inflation these arguments are irrelevant . From the standpoint of tracking down the truth of our inflation problem they are nothing more than red herring . Is it contended that the higher salaries of a few large corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflationary as to render any sacrifice by labor futile ? Or is it , perhaps , argued that eliminating these factors would solve the problem of inflation without the need to restrain wages ? Let it be said at the start that the big executive who seeks to enrich himself out of the war is both foolish and unpatriotic . But his chances of getting away with it are practically nil . The Treasury has announced a policy of disallowing unusual and excessive salaries and bonuses . The new tax bill is calculated to catch the major part of what the Treasury lets by . Under these conditions it is completely misleading to refer to salaries of the magnitude of $275,000 and $357,000 as though those amounts were actually at the disposal of the recipients . In the case of the latter sum , if it is duplicated this year , the Government will get at least 80 per cent of it . Exactly how much will be taken for taxes can not be determined without knowing the full details of other income , but it is probably safe to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collector gets through . This is a far cry from $357,000 . It can be argued that no man is entitled to as much as $70,000 . But in our judgment , the American people are not prepared to depart so far from their traditions as to set any specific limit beyond which it is " immoral " for a man 's income to go . Equality of sacrifice does not mean equality of income . But apart from this , how inflationary are such salaries ? The relatively small number and amount involved was strikingly shown by the Treasury 's figures with respect to the President 's proposal for a ceiling of $25,000 on individual incomes . These showed that only 11,000 individuals and married couples and only $184,000,000 of income would be involved . Contrast this with the inflationary gap of $30 , - 000,000,000 which Secretary Jones says Will exist next year between consumer incomes and the supply of goods available . It is absurd to suppose that our inflationary problem could be solved even by tailing away every cent of income from the highest-paid executives . II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that in some cases they have increased  --  before taxes . But here again it is misleading to forget the great change being wrought by the tax collector . In the first quarter of this year a representative group of corporations tabulated by the National City Bank showed that in spite of a large gain in gross , net income after taxes was down an average of 25 per cent . Reports for the first half of the year which have begun to appear in the past week indicate a continuation and acceleration of this trend . As an example , the report of the General Electric Company , just published , shows that in the face of an increase of 37 per cent in net sales billed , the earnings after taxes have fallen 21 per cent from last year . Here again , even if corporation profits were not being rapidly cut down by taxes , how inflationary would such profits be ? Corporations themselves do not compete in the consumption of scarce civilian goods . They are not consumers . Their increased profits would be inflationary only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that case they would in large part be subject also to the highest tax rates . But the facts are that dividends are being cut right and left . Labor has used the argument that higher wages can be paid out of these increased profits at virtually no cost to the companies because the sums involved are merely deducted from taxes that would otherwise go to the Government . Here is the most fallacious argument of all . It means that money that would otherwise go to meet the costs of the war , and to reduce the amount of inflationary borrowing that Government must do , should be turned loose as additional consumer spending power to compete for the dwindling supply of consumer goods . The best answer to that argument was given last week by Richard Gilbert , Deputy Administrator of the Office of Price Administration . He told the aircraft wage conference on the Pacific Coast that industry 's wartime profits " are not labor 's to demand ; nor industry 's to give away in the form of swollen salaries of management , unwarranted dividends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If inflation comes it will not come because a few men have received large salaries or because the Government has permitted a few men to make fat , unconscionable fees from war contracts . It will come because the purchasing power of the whole country , flowing out chiefly in the form of higher wages , has increased out of all proportion to the volume of goods and services available . And if inflation comes it will not be the corporations that will be reduced to misery and privation . It will be the workers whose high . wages will boy less and less the higher and higher they go .
