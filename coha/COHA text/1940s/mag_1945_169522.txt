Jacqueline Cochran , cosmetic manufacturer , crack airplane pilot and sometime commander of the Army Air Forces ' WASPS , got set last week for another dash into the war-this time as a Pacific correspondent for Liberty . <P> There was more to it than just another name-in-the-news . Jackie Cochran 's husband , famed Financier Floyd Odlum , had been dickering for Liberty for several months . ( Marshall Field tried , and found the price too high . ) Last week the sale price ( nearly $5,000,000 ) was set and just about in the bag . <P> Salvage Job . Liberty has tried hard to live down an unhappy past . Its masthead each week carries a significant sentence : " No longer connected with Macfadden Publications or the Chicago Tribune . " The magazine 's founding fathers , Colonel Robert R. McCormick and Captain Joseph Patterson , launched it 21 years ago as a poor man 's Saturday Evening Post , won readers but never did influence advertisers . Then Bernarr ( " Body Love " ) Macfadden took over , cheap-jacked its contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Three years ago , when Liberty was dropping a million dollars a year , Printer John Cuneo took it over for the printing bill , and decided to keep it going rather than let his huge presses stand idle . He called in his ace magazine salvager , handsome ex-Hearstling Paul Hunter , who had rescued Screenland , Silver Screen and Movie Show for him . Hunter ordered Liberty 's circulation pulled up out of the barbershop trade , to reach people with more buying power . At first , under Hunter , circulation continued to drop-to a low of 1,112,000 . He now has it up to 1,262,000 ( about as far as the paper supply will go ) , has spruced up the editorial fare , and claims to have made a million dollars last year . <P> " All Liberty lacks today is package , " says Hunter , moaning low over his lack of better paper to match his better contents . Pointing to the pulp layer in the middle of a slick paper sandwich , he sighs : " We have to print novels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackie Cochran and the big purse of Odlum 's Atlas Corp . ( oil , airlines , utilities , Manhattan 's swank Bonwit Teller store , movies ) could not solve the wartime paper problem . But it might well help develop Liberty 's new lease on life into a more successful pursuit of advertisers .
