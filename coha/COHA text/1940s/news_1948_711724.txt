txt The governors of the Old Vic certainly know how to It t into the news . Not losg ago they spread alarm and dismay among their present company , which is led by those two distinguished players Dame Edith Evans and Sir Cedric Hardwicke , by canceling their proposed 1949 visit to the United States . They would never have done this , it was said in the theatrical corners of the West End , if the present company had contained Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir Ralph Richardson . the two illustrious actor-directors of the Old Vic . Australia for the past year , is Sir Laurence , who has been in coming back to the Old Vic in January . Olivier Expected Welcome It is no secret that Sir Laurence himself expected this . And with good reason . He had raised the Old Vic to the highest peak of fame . I understand that the two actors went into this interview with the assurred expectation of receiving warm praise and commendation . Both are at the peak of celebrity ; both have served Old Vic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing less . With producer John Burrell they hold a five-year contract with the Old Vic that expires next summer . That contract is not going to be renewed . Old Vic is soon to become officially Britain 's national theater . I believe that Sir Laurence ? who could earn fantastic sums of money if he devoted his whole time to films ? holds Old Vic in such high esteem that he had prepared a 12-year policy for it in which he himself would haVe played a prominent part . Reason Explained That policy has not been ac- Except , of course , the Old Vic . What is the explanation ? The Old Vic before World War II was the cultural theater of the lower middle classes , the intellectuals , and the intelligent . It played at low prices with scratch productions . Then its theater was bombed . In 1944. it reopened with a company led by Richardson and Olivier and in the West End . It charged West End prices : it could do no other because its productions had now become expensive and up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olivier and Richardson won for it immense new public and worldwide fame , for their performances were nothing less than magnificent . Their " Peer Gynt , " " Lear . " " Richard III " and " Oedipus Rex " were as fine as anything that has been seen on the stage . But the old public was crowded out . It could not afford the Old Vic 's new prices . The West End theater was crowded at every performance . Everything was well , But Olivier and Richardson appeared only at a considerable sacrifice . The highest salary the Old Vic can afford to pay is ? 60 a week . In the commercial theater these players could earn ? 300 a week . On the screen they could get ? 1,000 a week . Obviously they could not stay at the Old Vic week after week , year after year . It was only reasonable that they should from time to time be released to do work of a more remunerative kind . And it is these absences that have brought the Old Vic low . Brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the Old Vic , without these players , is an anticlimax . Their absence does the theater more harm than their presence does good . It would seem that the Old Vic has come to the conclusion that the problem can not be solved in these terms . Though no statement of policy has been made and a polite hope is expressed ' that Olivier and Richardson will . continue to play for them , it seems almost certain that Old Vic has decided to leave the West End , start all over again , and build up a theatrical tradition as it did years ago on the work of young and relatively unknown players . It is a daring decision , but who can say it is not the right tone . cepted . So unprepared for this development was Sir Laurence that Sir Ralph ( just back from Hollywood ) and he went officially to see the ' governors of thee did Vic the other day to discuss plans for the future . this eminent actor , who has the entire film and theatrical world lying at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatrical parties airily waving his hand and saying in tones of humorous resignation : " Sacked , old boy , sacked . Left without a job . " Literally of course this is not true . There is hardly an entertainment organization anywhere in England or America that would not snap up Sir Laurence at any price he cared to name .
