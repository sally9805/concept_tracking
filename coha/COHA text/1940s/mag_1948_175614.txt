Television news last week : <P> CBS rolled its portable television unit into Broadway 's Alvin Theater , strung microphones along the footlight trough , and televised some carefully tidied-up scenes from Mister Roberts . It was the premire of Lucky Strike 's Tonight on Broadway ( Tues. 7 p.m. , CBS Television ) , the first of a series of televiews of Broadway hits . Like many a try out performance , the show needed tightening and pruning . It ran ten minutes overtime , poked around too long backstage . There were too many interviews ( with Author Thomas Heggen , Producer Leland Hayward , Henry Fonda and the cast ) , too little of Mister Roberts . " It 's really much better when you see it , " commented a woman televiewer . Television and Broadway agreed , hoped that this week 's try ( at The Heiress ) would be better . <P> The Chicago Tribune gave WGN-TV , its new television station ( Chicago 's second ) , a razzle-dazzle opening . Boss Bertie McCormick , laid up with a cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Wheaton estate ; but Senator C. Wayland ( " Curly " ) Brooks , Mayor Kennelly and Governor Green turned up at the studio to blow congratulatory kisses .
