INT . THE LYON 'S DEN NIGHT This is little more than a large-sized saloon to which a cheap " floor show " has been added . No attempt has been made to even decorate it like a night club . It was one large smoke-filled room , with a bar on one side , tables on the other and a cleared area at the end of the room for the " girl show " . The show is going on now and the place is dark except for the spotlight on the performer . Flannery and Mickey ENTER , stand a moment by the door , trying to adjust their eyes to the dimly-lit , smoke-heavy interior . 121 . MED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing against the wall near the bar . Lyons is a huge man with an ugly face , his big-muscled frame gone flabby with fat . His bouncer is almost as big , but more fit-looking and younger . They notice the two new arrivals by the door , glance at each other significantly , start toward the door . 122 . GROUP SHOT AT DOOR - as Lyons and the bouncer come up to Flannery and Mickey .  --  56  --  &nbsp; LYONS ( gravel-voiced ) Sorry , gents , all filled up tonight . &nbsp; FLANNERYWe 're looking for a pal . Supposed to meet us here . Lyons and the bouncer have no intention of letting anybody they suspect of being a cop look around the place without a warrant . They move in and start crowding Flannery and Mickey toward the door . &nbsp; LYONSMust not have showed up . No more room , boys . Ca n't block the door . . . fire hazard . Flannery , suddenly irritated with the crowding , grabs Lyon 's arm , whips it behind the big man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouncer is about to lunge at Flannery when the agent pulls his badge . &nbsp; FLANNERY ( to bouncer , still irritated ) Keep your peace , Muscles . . . or you 'll do your exercising in the can ! &nbsp; LYONS ( peers closely at badge ) Federals . . !

Only about half the tables are  --  57  --  occupied . The spotlight is on Lili White , who is doing her " dance " on the floor .

CLOSER SHOT AT DANCE FLOOR The little fat man , DOLLY CARNEY , is a repulsively obscene looking character , enormously wide for his height . His tiny eyes and grinning fat lips are almost lost in the flabby folds of his face . His beady eyes are fastened on the dancer and glisten greedily . The tiny cocktail sitting on the table in front of him looks ridiculously incongruous . Lili is finishing her number , wiggles her fanny in front of the drooling Carney and disappears around a wooden partition at the rear of the floor . Dolly gets immediately to his feet , waddles across the floor after her , just as Flannery and Mickey reach his table . They pause a moment , then start across the floor after Carney. 125 . INT . CORRIDOR Flannery and Mickey come around the partition into the shallow corridor .

LILI 'S DRESSING ROOM NIGHT A bare little room with a cheap dressing table and cracked mirror behind , a screen which serves as a closet , and pegs in the wall on which Lili 's clothes are hanging . Carney has his fat little arms around the half-naked Lili already , and is kissing her wetly . He whirls around as Flannery and Mickey ENTER .  --  58  --  &nbsp; DOLLY ( angrily ) Cantcha read , ya cheese-heads ! The men 's room 's two doors down ! &nbsp; FLANNERYRight now we 're just looking for you , Carney .

Flannery casually takes a robe down off a peg . &nbsp; FLANNERYIt 'll be a long wait . . . maybe three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pneumonia , waiting around like that . Flannery takes Carney 's other arm and they start out . Carney looks over his shoulder at Lili . . . &nbsp; DOLLYDo n't go ' way , baby .

LYON 'S DEN AT FRONT DOOR Joey Lyons , the bouncer , and another tough looking character are standing near the entrance , move casually to block the door when Flannery and Mickey appear with Carney between them . &nbsp; LYONSS'matter , Dolly ? Havin ' trouble ? Flannery and Mickey pause with Carney , who seems weighing the logic of having the agents detained while he gets away . Flannery is definitely irritated by the big man , Lyons . He looks Lyons up and down .  --  60  --  &nbsp; FLANNERY ( sarcastically ) You boys must all eat like pigs in here , Lyons . ( snaps , icy-voiced ) Get your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you through the door . . . ! Flannery and Mickey start forward with Carney .

ESTABLISHING SHOT CARNEY 'S HOTEL NIGHT A joint with only a sign reading " Hotel " on the exterior . DISSOLVE THRU TO : 129 . INT . CARNEY 'S ROOM NIGHT The room is rather fantastic . Carney has furnished it himself in his conception of opulence . The effect is as grossly cheap as Carney 's own appearance and character . . . The ancient , sagging double bed has a fringed satin spread and is piled with plump , imitation silk-covered pillows ; the lamps are horrors with tasseled shades , and the two lounge chairs are garish eye-sores . The room gives the appearance of being as overstuffed as Carney himself . Carney is sitting in one of the lounge chairs , Flannery on the edge of the bed , facing him ; Mickey is making a leisurely search of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Carney .
