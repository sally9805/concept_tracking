The Chicago Bears are probably the greatest collection of heavily falling stars ever assembled on a U. S. football field . Against Washington , in the play-off for the national professional championship last fortnight , they piled up the highest score ( 73-to-0 ) in the 20-year history of the National Professional Football League . " Break up the Bears , " growled U. S. fans last week , as they cocked their ears to what was going on behind closed doors in Washington 's Willard Hotel . <P> Inside those doors the ten club owners of the National League were meeting for their annual ritual known as the draft . The draft is something the league 's bigwigs thought up to prevent the richer clubs from snatching the best college talent . Each club in turn picks , one at a time , 20 college footballers of the graduating class . The club that finished last in the league picks first , the club that finished first picks last . ( Whether the club will get the player it picks is another matter ; none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until " preferred negotiation rights " to him have thus been assigned to a particular club . ) <P> But last week the star-stuffed Chicago Bears had already acquired a corner on this year 's crop of All-Americans . By prearranged deals with the tail-end Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers , the Bears got the dickering rights to Michigan 's Tom Harmon ( the Eagles ' first choice ) and Stanford 's Norman Standlee ( the Steelers ' first choice ) , in addition to their own selections : Ohio State 's Don Scott and Boston College 's Charley O'Rourke . <P> Though only 50% of the draftees actually sign up , this potential line-up was too much for the other club owners to bear . Before adjourning , they voted to plug the loophole in their draft rule : next year no club can sell or trade its first-or second-choice draftees until one playing year has elapsed , except by consent of the other nine league members .
