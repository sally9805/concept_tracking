Marinka ( music by Emmerich Kalman ; book and lyrics by George Marion Jr . &; Karl Farkas ; produced by Jules J. Leventhal &; Harry Howard ) is the cinema Mayerling in routine operetta form-which means Mayerling with a happy ending but some fairly unhappy flourishes en route . <P> This version of the love story of the Austro-Hungarian royal heir ( Harry Stockwell ) and his unroyal Marinka ( Joan Roberts ) furnishes a good deal more low comedy than high romance . It is told without style or period elegance , in a lurching effort to reconcile antics with atmosphere . As a result , the Alt Wien of 1888 and the Broadway of 1945 constantly collide , and neither wins out . The whole thing merely smacks of something in between the two-operetta the world over , circa 1912 . <P> As such , Marinka has its points-such as : Composer Kalman 's ( Sari , Countess Maritza ) tuneful if highly derivative music , and Albertina Rasch 's conventionally pretty dances . In addition , both Howard Bay 's sets and Mary Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than offsetting these assets is the fundamental fact that Marinka has been cast as limply as it was conceived . The two lovers have all the Old World grace of northern Indiana , and no one else in the cast , save for a comedy siren named Luba Malina , has a scrap of real personality .
