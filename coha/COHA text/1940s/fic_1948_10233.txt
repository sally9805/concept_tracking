floor of Buckman 's tavern went Revere and Lowell . Out of the front door they came with the trunk , Robert following them some fifty yards to the rear . On up the Bedford Road that quarter-mile to the Clarke parsonage carrying that trunk went Revere and Lowell turningfor a few backward glances toward the village common . Robert took more of these looks back . The moon had paled , the daybreak eased into daylight , the red-dawn glimmers of sunrise shoved up the eastern sky . Down the slope of the Boston road into the village Robert saw them . The two lanterns Robert Newman had lighted in Christ Church steeple had foretold this . There they were . " God , what a sight ! " Robert grunted . Now he thought of a remark of a British officer reported to Dr. Warren the day before , " There will be hell to pay tomorrow . " Down the long slope in steady marching order came six companies of light infantry , a stream of scarlet cloth flicked with brass buttons glittering in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horsemen in the lead and alongside guiding , officers astraddle their big horses picked for paradeand show . The morning mist mingled with a film of dust that rose from the road . Somewhat dreamlike , a touch of fantasy to it , a flicker of the unbelievableabout it . Robert was thinking and Captain Parker 's men on the common , some of them , " No , it ca n't be true that this moment has come . Do we see what we see ? Yes , there they are . We have never seen it before and so we look twice and three times and more and  --  yes  --  it is true , there they arc , the marching British Regulars , eleven miles out of Boston , all night marching in the moonlight , all night marching and for what ? Soon we will know . This day and the hours of this clay will tell what they get for coming . No mistake , the more you look the more sure you are it is them . " Robert following Revere and Lowell with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scarlet-clad major gallop to maybe six rods from Parker 's ranks of Minute Men . He heard the major yell and learned afterward that the major was crying , " Lay down your arms , you damned rebels , and disperse , " and that Parker told his men , " Do n't fire unless fired on , but if they mean to have a war let it begin here , " or as Paul Revere heard it , " Let the troops pass by and do n't molest them without they begin first . " Robert could see Parker 's men breaking ranks . Parker saw they would be swept away if they tried to fight what was sliding down that slope toward them . As they broke ranks the Minute Men carried with them their guns . Robert could hear the major on his big horse snarling and heard afterwardthat the major was crying , " Damn you , why do n't you lay down your arms ? " Robert for a moment had been tempted to run to the common and stand in line with Captain Parker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green common , two ranks of them , some sixty men , in farm clothes of homespun and leather , with their firelocks , their flintlocks , their shotguns never yet aimed at living men , never yet tried on humantargets . They were Minute Men and this was the minute they had waited for . Half the time Robert looked back toward the common , and the other half kept his eyes on Revere and Lowell with the trunk . At last he turned for a look at the Clarke parsonage and saw coming out of the house the two men for whom the long arm of Great Britain had reached clean across the Atlantic Ocean to take them for treason trials , Hancock and Adams . Any two or three of a dozen enemy horsemen in the village a quarter-mile away could in a minute of riding have captured the two foremost leaders of rebellion in New England , the two Continental Congress delegates . The wheels turned . The horses jogged away , with Revere as guard and escort . The chaise moved on to Woburn and beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ringing alarms , drums callingMinute Men , and two sharp crackles of gunshot volleys . Adams felt good and smiled and exclaimed , " Oh , what a glorious morning is this ! " And Hancock thought Adams was talking about the weather  --  a fine , clear , coolish , windy day , and everything underfoot a little dry or dusty from weeks of no rain . Robert left the road , ran across back fields to where among lilac bushes in a lot back between the blacksmith shop and the Jonathan Harrington house , he could see the common . Shooting had begun . The two loud blasts he had heard were volleys the enemy invaders had sent into Captain Parker 's line-up of Minute Men . Off the common they had scattered , some shooting from behind fences and trees , from corners of the Buckman tavern . Some in the scattering could n't run . One lay sprawled on the turf as if he had run and then dropped face clown and arms spread . Another lay still with his face to the morning sky , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his firelock . Others , three , four , five of them lay writhing with their wounds , another sitting up and twisting himself to find a position to ease his wound . Robert set his teeth , clenched his fists , took out his pistol to aim at bunches of redcoats crossing the green , decided to wait , wished he had a musket , wished he was forty men with forty muskets . Coming straight toward him he saw one of the Minute Men zigzagging , half-stumbling , guiding his feet somehow straight toward the IIarrington house . On and on , stopping to double himself with pain , raise himself again , and go on . Out of the front door of the IIarrington house came a woman who saw him trying to reach her . She would help him walk . At the front steps he sagged and fell . Her hands and arms were round him , she tugged at lifting him on into his home . Jonathan Harrington , Tr. had come home to die before his wife 's arms , could reach him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun to try a shot at a trooper rushing to bayonet a Minute Man kneeling and wobbling . This was Jonas Parker , a cousin of Captain John Parker . He stood his ground , this Jonas Parker . A bullet had torn through the middle of him . Robert saw him sag to his knees while his hands worked at reloading his firelock , his hands fumbled among bullets and extra flints in his hat on the ground before him . Jonas Parker would on his knees reload and fire . He would send a last bullet into the oncomingline . Then a trooper had sighted what Jonas Parker was doing , rushed on him and stretched him flat on the green turf with one straight thrust of the polished steel . Bleeding , defiant , stubborn as any granite boulder in Middlesex County , Jonas Parker singlehandedhad tried to stop a marching army . " Huzza ! " and " Huzza ! " came the cheers of the enemy in a long line of eight hundred marching men in and out of the village and on along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine wounded for the village to remember them by . " Huzza ! " and " Huzza ! " Robert heard them . Their victory had come cheap , one man shot in the thigh , another in the hand , and two bullets nicking the commander 's horse , " Iluzza ! " and " Huzza ! " Let the village go bury Jonas Parker , Jonathan Harrington , Jr. , Robert Munroe , Isaac Muzzy , John Brown , Samuel Hadley and Asahel Porter . Let them tend the wounds of Francis Brown , Joseph Comee , Nathaniel Farmer , Ebenezer Munroe , Jr. , Jedediah Munroe , Timothy Munroe , Solomon Pierce , John Robbins , John Tidd , Thomas Winship and the mulatto Prince Estabrook . " Huzza ! " and " Huzza ! " rang in Robert 's ears . Was he seeing what he thought his eyes told him , hearing what his ears told him ? Was there a drum beating as though of more action to come and what he had seen was only a beginning ? Again the klongklongof the belfry bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Menotomy , rang bells and on the air the sound of gunshots  --  and those men limping and wobbling toward houses where women were running out from doorways  --  Robert saw these realities and could n't get at the queer dreaminess that had him in a soft daze , he who had told brother John Locke in New York there must be more action and less talk . Then it came over him that two things surged in his blood , pressed deep in his brain , for the moment held back his will to action . One was the awful fact that the long-talked-of war had begun . There could be no going back . Whatever resulted from this day the news of it would go wild and flaming over the other twelve colonies . The deed was done . The fire would spread and run wild . Now would conic soldiers , guns , supplies to the army the Continental Congress was rail ing . Now would come the terrors and the hard grinding that Bliss 1 ' ; d munds foresaw and rather than live to sec it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shames that haunted Mim . Yes , Mim , he hadp503not so completely forgotten Mim in a long time . She was the second part of what surged in him . For out there just about where Jonas Parker sagged to his knees and tried to reload his firelock and send one more shot with his dying curse on foreign invaders  --  just about there on that same spot of turf , Robert had stood with Mim last December in clear moonlight , such a sweet clean moonlight , and their skates slung over their shoulders and their warm blood coursing as their arms held each other tight and they kissed once and they kissed again and they held hands and looked up at the winter moon . They had spoken of the light snow on the ground having an infinite hush near to low music and if you listened you could hear the slow going down of a wind that an hour before had roared at them as their skates curved over the moonlit thin snow on the pond . Robert shook himself out of this , ran to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes , and three of the wounded into Buckman'stavern . There he met Isaiah Thomas who had ridden out from Cambridge . He agreed with Thomas there would be fighting at Concordand the enemy would that afternoon come marching back from Concord and there would be Minute Men by the hundreds firing at the marching troops from roadside fences , rocks , trees , logs , hillocks , hedges , trees . He agreed with Thomas that some of those men , perhapsmany of them , would run out of powder , bullets , flints . Robert knew of several hide-outs of ammunition and why should n't he take Thomas ' horse and ride the back fields and supply men run out of reloading ? Eating a slice of cold roast pork with bread , Robert rode away on Thomas ' horse . Hardly beyond the village limits Robert looked toward a pasture corner , near a thicket of briers , and riding up saw two men on the ground . One was a redcoat , both of them still , the one in homespun lying face down . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair of Darius Wilming . An eyelid quivered , the two eyes half-opened , and a throaty mumble , " You , Robert ? " " Yes , Darius , what happened , what shall I do ? " The two men had met here , Robert gathered from Darius ' slow broken moanings . Neither had seen the other till they came out of different ends of the thicket . They shot . " I killed him . . . I du n no if he killed me . . . I ca n't stand  --  " Robert rode toward the village , overtook tall rawboned Gamaliel Meader carrying a firelock and wondering when he would shoot and how many this day . They went to the nearest house , hitched to a onehorsecart , drove it to the roadside near the thicket , carried Darius to the cart , Meader driving , Robert seated in the cart holding Darius ' head and shoulders . Jake had run out to meet them , had tied the horse , had run up to walk alongside them , no slightest cry from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Liberty Room stood Ruth Wilming and the two daughters , crying , " Oh God , our Darius . " They carried him into the ground-floor bedroom of his father and mother . They loosened his clothes . Robert took off his shoes . The little sounds from him were now a faint moan of pain and again an expulsionof breath as though with relief . Ruth Wilming stood by , once with low hoarse whisper , " Our Darius , merciful God , our Darius . " Darius had heard . His eyes did n't open but faintly his voice , " Mother , yes , mother . " He was going to lift a hand toward her but the hand dropped . Water , would he like water ? The fingers of his right hand lifted and came down  --  no water now . Gamaliel Meader came in with young Lemuel Cartwright , indenturedfor a year as a student under Dr. Joseph Warren . He looked closely at the bullet hole in the outer jacket . " An abdominal wound . " He unbuttoned the shirt , slashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that adhered to the area of the wound . The youth 's eyes slowly opened , fluttered and stared , and the slow words , with his turning head , " Mother , it is you . Aggie , Deb , Jake , it happened quick . I kill him . He kills me . So quick . Both of us , him and me . " Ile sank back , the eyes closed , a white quiver over his face , locks of brown hair down to his eyebrows . Cartwright again tried to get to work on the wound , to examine and make his decisions . At the touch of the groping , probing hands , the body writhed and shuddered . Suddenly Darius seemed gathering himself . The body stiffened , rose , and he sat erect , wild-eyed yet calm-spoken . " The bosom of God , I am ready for the bosom of God . Father and Mim , tell father and Mim now we must fight . It has come . " Ile crumpled backward , horizontal again , with a sighing and sleepy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . In the bosom of God many pleasant valleys . . . . You 'll be there , mother , we 'll all be there ... . Even Mim will be there . " A long sleepy moan and , " Kiss me , mother . " Ruth Wilming bent over and touched her lips softly to his . The first faint flicker of a smile came over his mouth . " Now I can rest me , mother . The pain is gone . Tell Mim I will go far down the pleasant valley and meet her with a kiss when  --  " There his words ended . His shut eyes held fast . " It is the end , " murmured Cartwright . Then quick-spoken but with reverence Cartwright said , " He is be yond my care , others need me this hour , " as he picked up his instrumentand supply bag . " You did your best , " said Ruth Wilming at the door of the room . " You know you have our thanks . " They stood in quiet at the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face with the peace of a great rock across it . They stood a long moment of no one saying anything  --  the mother , the two sisters , Robert Winshore , and the man everyone knew as a friend and somewhatof a teacher or exemplar of Darius , this tall rawboned Gamaliel Meader , thirty years older than Darius , as faithful as Darius in attendanceat their Congregational church . The mother had heard Darius often mention the two of them as " seekers together , " Darius saying he would go in snow or rain to the midweek prayer meeting , " if it should be for the sake of hearing the blessed Meader speak one of his prayers . " Ruth Wilming looked toward the gray-headed Meader , a farmer with a wind-bitten face and a wide sculptured mouth , quiet communionsin his eyes and composure . He read her as having tidal waves beating in her and she would n't break under them . " Gamaliel Meader , " she was saying , " speak a prayer . " She knelt on the rag-carpeted floor , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their knees , bent their heads low , their eyes closed . In a sonorous voice husky with earth strength Gamaliel Meader gave forth with the meditations he believed his young friend would have wanted spoken for this hour : " 0 God of Hosts , we came to this wilderness and gave it the hard oak and hickory of our plows and the iron of our axes and the sweat of our toil , till in due time we came to call it our own hard-won land . Now we are told by proud men who know not what they do  --  vain men lacking vision of what we have done , with no understanding of what manner of men we are , not knowing we are freeborn and asking that our children be freeborn  --  that they must fix their rule over us. " 0 God of Hosts , it was our prayer that strife be kept away from us that we might enjoy our hills and rolling acres in peace , that the test of steel , fire and blood be kept away from us . Now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us we are strangers and they will instruct and command us in our wavy of life. " 0 God of Hosts , this youth , this lad of valor and fortitude , stood his ground today as a man , as one freeborn . On an altar of freedom his lifeblood was poured out today and our hearts will remember him and the day of his passing , remember long . " Outside the sky was a dome of clear blue . On the winding road from Lexington to Boston rose dust whirls from the feet of horses and men . Ruth Wilming steadied her knees on the rag carpet , moaned softly , " Yes , remember long , " and heard Gamaliel Meader 's voice : " Grant our conduct may be such in thine eyes that we may meet him again in thy eternal arms . Grant that when fiery trial comes to us we shall meet it full-front and dauntless as young Darius Wilming . Be with the grieving father and mother . Let their sorrow be a garmentof consecration to them . Let thy tokens visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart and unitep506themselves with his vision of men freeborn maintaining their freedom . " Beget wisdom in us as we struggle toward the light . Hammer us into fresh fortitude and steel resolution on thy ancient anvils of trial and fire. " 0 infinitely wise Maker of the sky and the land we love , thou who devised the sunfall and the rainfall of peace and the storm bolts of lightning , be thou with us now . Vouchsafe us that liberty may never be a possession profaned by idle mouths , by creatures of vanity , by the devious self-seekers . Pour into us thy grace and fellowship . Give thy great and deep consolations to those who loved this youth as they love life itself . Bestow on us the strength to hold fast . Make us humble and calm for our difficult undertakings in the heavy days to come . We petition thee in Christ 's name . Amen . " Alongside the road four miles toward Concord Robert rode the back fields , seeking men run out of powder and bullets for reloading . The enemy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every direction . And having destroyed what he could find of stores and munitions , the enemy was marching back to Boston , back to safety . As they marched no one could tell from where the next shot would come laying one of their grenadiers dead or wounded in the dusty road . He sent out flanking parties to rove the back fields and search out the sharpshooters . These parties were Robert 's main worry and his second worry was the regular fire from the marching troops toward any puff of smoke from behind a fence or tree . Twice he heard the zing of bullets meant for him , rode to cover , and had the luck to keep going till near Lexington his horse gave out and he left it with the bridle off in a friendly cow pasture , walking a mile or more to near Lexington where he saw scurrying Minute Men shooting at the enemy , dodging in and out , some alone , some in couples , others in little bunches , climbing walls and fences , running from woodsheds and barns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then to a tree for a shot and after a shot back behind the tree to reload or to scamper to the rear to reload and then return toward the enemy . " There 's more to shoot at now , " grinned one Minute Man to Robert . A fresh army of eight hundred troops had marched in from Boston . The new arrivals were holding the day while those of the other army rested , the army that had started from Boston by moonlight and marched all of last night and after fighting at Concord had marched since noon the dusty six miles back to Lexington . " We was in the meeting house , the House of God , " this Minute Man went on . " A cannon ball crashed in and we made for cover . " Two six-pounder cannon had wheeled to an elevation where they could send fire into anything on the Boston highway for a mile out of Lexington . Black smoke rolled where the home had stood ofp507Deacon Joseph Loring , now seventy-three years old and not in the fighting , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornhouse , all going up in smoke . The Minute Man pointed toward the Loring place . " A nice piece uh proputty , hell of a business to burn it . " He had finished reloading his firclock , pointed where the new commander , arrived with the fresh troops , was riding and giving orders , a lean , high-set man on a white horse , his scarlet coat and white breeches " wonderful to shoot at , " said the Minute Man , and going on with a grin , " I tried for him twice and got one button . Fellow next to me tried three times and all he got was a button . That general on that horse I bet he 's got a bargain with the Devil himself . We shoot five times and get two buttons . I be dingdanged if I 'd believe it if I had n't seen it . " He started for a fence corner he had picked , " We 'll get him yet , mebbe . " With a dead man 's firelock and powder and bullets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minute Men who ranged the back fields and kept up a fire on the enemy troops that began marching to Boston midafternoon . Now for the first time in his life Robert ran his eye along a gun barrel sighting it at another man , aiming to kill . Once he saw his man drop and once again a redcoat falling out of the marching line and Robert could n't know for sure whether yet he had killed a man . It became dizzy and wearing work to fire , reload , fire again , run ahead and find another place of cover from which to shoot , always with an eye out for flanking parties the enemy sent roving the back fields . There was a monotony about it , at times an exultation , or at moments Robert was dizzy and dreamy . Near the road he would take a chance on firing from between the slits of a hewn-log hogpen , he decided . The trees and bushes of a lane would cover him as he ran for it , hide him from the line of men slogging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men tired and worn as he . He made it safe in a move to the hogpen , stopped for a long breath and a cooling off before he would pick his target and shoot . Around the corner of a barn he saw two hands and two forearm sleeves moving along the ground . Next came a blue-cockade hat and a red coat and white breeches  --  a wounded British officer crawling to the shade . Reaching the shade the officer groaned and lay trying to rest , shifting position to ease himself . Robert leaped to the man , took away a pistol , pulled him into the barn , looked through the blood , mud and dust on the man 's face and cried , " Lieutenant George Frame ! " " Yes , Winshore , " groaned Frame between set teeth that had parted and set to grinding again . " You 're in pain . " " A ball in the right leg . Broke a bone , I believe . " He set his teethp508and there came an escape of breath , a high thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's amazement that pain could be so exquisitewhile he still kept his head . He hated Frame . He had believed he could kill Frame . Now he pitied the man and admired him . This was a fighting man . The darts and quivers of pain slowed down a few moments and Frame twisted to ease himself , then lay calm and closed his eyes as though to rest himself for the next torment . Robert waited , wondering that his legs did n't carry him straight out the barn door and clown the field to safety , for any second of time might see a searching party at the barn door . The dust , mud and blood had come on the face from the man 's hands wiping away sweat , Robert saw . Under the crisscross of grime the man 's usual fair and florid skin ran in streaks sickly pale . " You 've lost blood . " " Too much . " " Try to hind it ? " " Could n't , too weak . " The pain came again . He writhed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moan came again . Robert cut a tie rope in a horse stall , wrapped it tight above the big blotch of red on the white breeches that indicated where the wound oozed . he brought a dipper of water from a bucket on a shelf , offered it , " Not cold but the best there is . " Frame nodded . Robert poured more than half the dipper clown the eager man 's mouth , took a kerchief and washed the face , spoke a " God help you . " Then at the crack below the upper hinge of the door Robert scanned the ground toward the road , ran for the hogpen shelter , between a slit saw four men leaving the road and coming up the lane . At the house the four of them went in at the back door , one coming out to stay at the half-closed door holding his musket , keeping a lookout toward the barn and the back fields , little more than his head , right shoulder and his musket barrel showing . A minute , two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his musket held careless as though if there were danger it would have showed by now . Robert took a long steady aim , fired , felt the heavy jolt at his shoulder , saw the trooper drop his musket , fling one arm wild and then fall the four steps down from the door . Robert made for the same winding lane by which he had come , with its fair cover of bush clumps and trees . At the lane end he leaped a fence and ran straightway from the road and soon was farther from the road than any searching party or flanking columns went that day . As he ran the dizziness and dreaminess that had come over him in spells during the afternoon was on him . Over one more fence into another field he would go and then stop to think what next . His foot caught leaving the fence top . He could n't make his feetp509behave as earlier in the day . He made a clumsy fall to the ground and lay there . A flow of comfort ran over him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next . Robert hoped it was n't sleepiness , creeping over him , stealing through him sleepiness , sleepiness . " God , I 'm sleepy , " he yawned and heard the humming of bees in clover , and in a swift processional saw the horse he lost last night , Revere and Lowell carrying Hancock 's trunk , Jonas Parker sagging to his knees on the common , the white face of Darius dying , two redcoats dropping , Frame with set teeth of pain , the redcoat tumbling down the doorstep , bees in clover , and he hoped it was n't sleepiness . Yet he slept . In the dry thin grass and weeds there , he slept . When he awoke it was past sunset and the stars had come out on the evening of April 19 , 1775 . Her man had gone to the fighting and a woman heard alarm bells , the roll of drums and shooting  --  the shooting had begun . She could see the smoke of a burning house . Next they would be at her house , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods and hide till the fighting let down . She was thinking which way to go , which woods the best hiding place . Before going she would put on a checked apron . The neat woman wore a clean checked apron and she had that kind of pride . She pulled a bureau drawer where she had seven checked aprons . She put an apron on , carried the baby , told the others to follow . They reached the woods . They lived through the day and came home safe . Hiding in the woods however she had to laugh and the children laughed with her . For she found when she reached the woods she had put on all seven of her checked aprons . One after another while thinking about the fighting , the shooting , the burning , she put on every last one of her aprons and wondered how many she would have put on if she had had seven more aprons . In the Liberty Room of the Wilming house this was the only thing Robert heard that night to give him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were easy when he first slept but after a while began to grind and he woke hungry . In the Liberty Room he ate six thick slices of wheat bread and fair hunks of cheese , with ale . In and out the room went people talking of the day , the fighting , the sorrow , the victory . To the Minute Men and the Sons of Liberty the victory called for a jubilee . They would have danced , sung and made merry , only they were tired and there was sorrow . They could be vehement however about the British Regulars , professional troops under officers who had campaigned over Europe , trained soldiers with tried and approved weapons , being defeated and sent reeling from Concord , and their dead and wounded scattered on the dusty road from Lexington to Charlestown . The news of it would go to the other colonies , to London , to the wide world . Long there had been talk of the war . " Now the war has begun . "  |p510Over  at Menotomy the night before , shortly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a searching party knocking at the door of the Black Horse tavern , Elbridge Gerry and two others in their nightshirts running out the back door and lying on the ground in a field of corn stubble that hid them . In the damp night chill with only a linen nightshirt between them and the cold ground they lay an hour or more , crept with caution and quiet back to the tavern . The house had been searched . They would have been taken . It was a hurried search . " It war n't no slow time they was searching , " said the Minute Man telling it to Robert , " for under his pillow Mr. Gerry found his timepiece , his nice solid-gold watch , ticking like it knew he would be back soon . " A thousand men had been on the way from Worcester , as the fighting ended at Charlestown . Hundreds of other companies from scattered towns and villages had been on the way . From hill to hill and town to town that morning and afternoon had gone the gunshot signals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concord the cannon had been laid in a field and furrows plowed over them , bullets had been thrown into soap barrels , into the bottoms of barrels of feathers . The sixteen-mile march out from Boston and back had failed to reach and destroy the stores they sought . The enemy had lost heavy in dead and wounded and more important to the Patriots , the enemy pride had suffered . By candlelight , it was told , a shoemaker and his wife in Menotomy were melting pewter plates and running them into bullets . The marchingtroops saw their light through front window shutters . A soldier knocked at the door , asked what they were doing up so late in the night . The wife answered , " The old man is sick and I 'm making him some herb tea . " The soldier looked in to see the " old man " who had leaped into bed and did n't take time to stir the fireplace ashes where the wife had dumped the molten pewter . Gamaliel Meader stopped briefly , saying , " The old men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River he 's eighty years old . His wife asked him to go with her and the children late afternoon so to not be home when the Regulars came back . He went on oiling his flintlock and cleaning two pistols , would n't go with her , walked off and picked him a stone wall near Medford , waited till they came marching along . He pulled trigger and saw his man go down . They saw his smoke and rushed on him . He killed another with his pistol . By then they stunned him with a bullet in the head , clubbed him with their musket butts and gave him the bayonet . Now a fellow was here saying he talked with Dr. Tufts who fixed his wounds up in Cooper Tavern and old Sam Whittemore is saying pert as you please he 'll live many a year yet . His wife asking him if he ai n't sorry he answers , ' No ! I would run the same chance again ! ' " Deacon Josiah Haynes of Acton was another , said Meader . " He'sp511going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on to Lexington , shooting and reloading . Between Fiske Hill and Lexington common they got him . An earnest man , they tell me , Deacon Haynes was , in his farm work and his church work , and terriblyearnest today about driving the British back to Boston . " And James Hayward from Acton , one foot part cut off , you know , " Meader went on . " He comes up to the little Fiske farmhouse south of the road and down the east slope of Fiske Hill . The family was gone and the Regulars had been in the house and took what loot they wanted . And Hayward after a drink from the well going to the house meets a Regular who had stayed . You 're a dead man ! ' says the Regular . And so are you ! ' says Hayward . They both shoot . They both fall . The Regular is dead . Hayward they say wo n't live . The ball went through his powder horn and drove splinters into his side . In his bed he calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A pound of powder and forty bullets he started with and the powder about gone and only two or three bullets left . You see , ' he told them . I am not sorry . I die willingly for my country . ' Who would have believed it , limping on that foot part cut off , miles and miles shooting and reloading ? " The Minute Man of earlier in the clay came up to Robert with a grin . He had met another sharpshooter who aimed at the commander on the white horse . " And like me and the other fellow all he got was a button . Three good men try their guns three times to knock him off that white horse . And all we get is three buttons off his coat . " He had learned that the man on the white horse was Earl Percy who headed the second army from Boston and took command at Lexington . " I hear he rode on into Charlestown , the luckiest man and horse in America today . Mebbe we should 've shot at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us would have to do it . A purty white horse , with a shine . I could kill him but not that horse . " Agnes had sat at the table as Robert munched endless bread and cheese . She told of the burial late in the afternoon . The body of Darius had gone with the others into a broad grave that received all of Lexington 's dead . No sermon or preaching , just a simple short prayer by the Reverend Jonas Clarke as a service . Off in a corner was the trench , near the woods , and the horse carts came with the boxes made of four large boards nailed together and " the slain were let down , one by one , and we waited to see them covered up with clods , and then for fear the British should find them , Reverend Clarke thought some of the men had best cut some pine and oak boughs and spread them on the place of burial so it looked like a heap of brush . " It came harder for Agnes to tell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concord and Lexington , who was going to marry Deb  --  he had been caught by flankers and lingered and died . Deb hadp512run two miles to his home , where they had taken him , and he died holding her hands and saying he was sure he would get well . What of Jake ? Robert was asking . Agnes lighted with glee about Jake . It was his own idea to go to the back fields with two jugs of water . From time to time came Minute Men desperate with thirst and " here was this boy beckoning them to cone drink the water he brought for them . " " I have n't seen Ma tonight , " said Robert . " Plumb tuckered , she just fell on a bed and went to sleep . " " And Deb ? " " She 's with Pa . " " And he  --  he ? " " It 's hard to tell about him . " " Where is he ? " " In the room there . " Aggie nodded her head toward it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You can tell me the worst , Aggie . " " He 's suffering  --  " " Then the is alive , thank God . " " Alive , yes , but God , in what a way ! He wriggles and twists and moans with the pain of it . " " He was shot , then ? " " Him too , down toward Menotomy late afternoon , behind a pile of rails and his right arm raised up over the rails . Says he was a damned fool to let that arm get up there . They got his arm , shot a ball through it , splintered the bone . The doctor says it will be summer and fall healing , if all goes well . After that the arm will be crooked , no use . " " Ma said if you cane to wake her before you went away , " Aggic went on . " She did n't have a chance this morning to ask you about Min . " " I do n't know where I go from here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stay in Darius ' room . Darius wo n't mind . " Aggie rose . " I 'll wake Ma . " The crowd had been thinning out and the last stragglers were going while Ruth Wilming and Robert talked of the Wilming home and farm and the press of fate on it this day . " He suffers , the pain wo n't let him sleep , " she said with a nod of her head toward the room . " Once he gnashed his teeth and said anybody that ever hated him was welcome to see him now and it might be that Mim would like to come in . Cruel to say but he was part out of his right mind with the pain . " Mim should know about today , soon as we can get word to her , " she went on after a pause and Robert with nothing to say . " I suppose we ca n't ask her to come back here and help put us on our feet again . But she ought to know . At least it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know she 'd want to have a look at where Darius is under the ground . " The last came with a quick stifled choke . Robert drank half the mug of fresh ale before him , put his two hands over the two of Ruth Wilming that lay folded on the table . " You are a brave woman . " " She 's wonderful , " said Jake , sliding into a chair at the table with a gentle and sly smile . " She 's wonderful like Mim is . " " I 'll get the news to Mim , " said Robert . " I mean , I 'll try . " The town of Boston would be triple-guarded now , they knew . Ruth Wilmingeyed Robert as though he could be somewhat her own . Jake 's pointed face took a shine , his lips and eyes fluttered with a smile . " Tell Mim it was like she said , hell to pay . Then tell her the blue sky did n't come down and the stars was out like usual . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ruth Wilming quietly opened the door and held it for Robert to step into the room . On the bed lay Noah Wilming , the right sleeve cut from his gray wool shirt , his right arm in splints and bandages laid on a pillow . Deb sat in a chair , her body sloped downward , her eyes closed . She awoke a minute later when her father let out a moan in a sliding gamut from high to low . Then Noah Wilming saw his wife and Robert , closed his eyes , twisted all his body except the right arm on the pillow , and spoke with closed eyes after settling quiet again . " It ca n't last ever , Robert . Nothing lasts ever . It will end . Everything ends . " " It 's hard , Mr. Wilming . We know it 's hard . " They stood a minute or two , saw Deb falling to her sleep again . Ruth Wilming took Robert to Darius ' room and before leaving , " How is Mim ? There was n't time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saturday night , his escape from Frame and the Regulars , and , " Mim is restless . She do n't know which way to turn . She 's fighting her way through herself and a lot of enemies outside of herself . But she is n't weakening under it . She 's strong , Ma , she 's got terrible strengths in her , good as any of us , I guess , and it may take time but I think she 'll come through . " And Robert kissed the mother on the cheek , " Good night , Ma . I 'll try to make it into Boston tomorrow night . " Sleepy though he was Robert before getting into bed thumbed casually in a candlelight through two books of sermons Darius had dogeared , then more slowly in the pages of three other books , the Bible , The Pilgrim 's Progress , and a tattered copy of the play of Hamlet that three generations had passed along to a fourth . Mim liked to imitate a deacon who said , " What I make of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin he got teched in the head . " Mim would add , " Hamlet was mad , in a way , but not so mad as the scheme of life where he could n't fit himself in . " Folded in The Pilgrim 's Progress was a sheet in Mim 's handwriting ,  |p514a  poem , " credited to one Thomas Dekker , the year I know not but very old . " Robert could hear her voice as she had said the poem that afternoon when they had walked to Aunt Ellen 's little farm and seen autumn leaves whirl scurrying toward the sunset : Art thou poor , yet hast thou golden slumbers ? O sweet content ! Art thou rich , yet is thy mind perplexed ? O punishment ! Dost thou laugh to see how fools are vexed To add to golden numbers , golden numbers ? 0 sweet content ! 0 sweet , 0 sweet content ! Work apace , apace , apace , apace ; Honest labour bears a lovely face . Then hey nonny nonny , hey nonny nonny ! In the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert met a small leaf whereon Mim had shaped in exquisite miniature letters Roger Bacon 's The Four Stumbling Blocks to Truth . Folded with it was a scrap of rough wrapping paper where Darius had written in big letters : " I have studied these much with myself and with Gamaliel Meader . We are axe only we have not stumbled over Number Four . " Of this Robert was certain , Darius was one who had never tripped and fallen as one more fool over " concealment of ignorance by ostentationof seeming wisdom . " Once in the night Robert woke out of a swift dream when he heard Mim in the room whispering , " Darius , you have n't really gone , have you ? Darius , you did n't mean to leave us , did you ? " I Must Forget YouLAND arrivals into Boston came by the Neck road . Men afoot and mounted , men on carts and wagons with women or families , came over the Neck every day . Now after April 19 , 1775 , they were stopped by the officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where going and what doing when they got there . Yet the guard could n't be too strict in some cases . Boston had to eat , provisions were not plenty , and carts and wagons loaded with livestock , poultry , vegetables , by the scores came through with little search unless something roused suspicion . A load of hay for the horses of majors and colonels was more thanp515welcome , hay being scarce , Whig farmers bringing in hay only to Whig friends . Midafternoon the officer of the guard liked it that the driver of a load of hay whistled to his horses and himself the good old tune of " The British Grenadiers . " The driver having passed through drove his load to the barn of a Whig , waited to see who might be looking as he forked the hay into the loft . And no one saw a man slide out of the hay and into the barn . What followed was complicated . The Whig barn-owner was a Minute Man and a Son of Liberty , twice arrested as a rioter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silas Ludgate affair . They had often come to his house to question him and at times had his house and barn watched . He brought food to Robert Winshore in the barn while it was still daylight near sunset . He went to Aunt Ellen 's and learned that Marintha Wilming , because of her associations with Robert , was under suspicion and they had called several times to press her in questionings of Robert , of the secret organizations , of his work for them . When Robert came to Aunt Ellen 's it must be after dark , keeping to the alley and entering by the back door , as he did . Aunt Ellen had come down for a greeting and returned to her room , and halfway up the stairs , rather softly , " You 'll be safer to make it a short stay , children . " Their arms went around each other and they kissed and Robert did n't want to make anything of it but noticed Mim did n't rub her car lightly below his collarbone . " And she took my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his head and blood , a misgiving he could have no time for now . She had slipped out of his arms without being abrupt and yet too soon and too smoothly she did it . That too was a blur in his head and blood and no time now to look back at it . He seated himself on their old settee , bent forward with elbows on knees and one hand wrapped around fingers of his other hand . Mim pulled a chair and sat opposite him , elbows on knees , one hand curling its hold on the other hand 's thumb . " It broke yesterday , " he said . " Yes , the war has begun . " " And it comes hard . " " You wanted it to come hard . You ca n't have a war not hard . " " I have a message for you  --  and news . " " I 'd as lief you brought me no messages . Enough news there was when we met last . " " What is wrong , Mim ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know what you 're saying , Mini , and you know my answer . " " Agony , dead men , cripples , waste , ruin , women and children waiting for those who never come home . " He looked into her face , a deep and long look.  |p516She  went on , her faint smile hard and mocking . " The wedding was to have been in June . Whatever year it was the wedding in June , the blossom month . In my father 's house the wedding and Jake to fill the big Liberty Room with flowers and Darius with his brown hair and brown eyes would usher the few invited to their chairs . Then after the words until death do us part ' and the rest of it , Darius would drive us to our own little ten-acre place . By then the moon would be up and before going into the house we would stand under an apple tree and look up at the moon through a latticework of white apple blossoms . And once we joked that the first baby would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darius . " The faint smile had faded . Iler lips stretched wide over the gaunt bone structure of her face . It was a mask rather than a face . " Apple blossoms  --  pooh  --  and the moonlight a mishmash with the stink of stale cheese . What do you and your rabble care ? Ashes and blood now  --  and good women crying for their lost ones . " " You may yet understand better the hearts of your friends and kinfolk . The sorrow may come less bitter . " IIer words sprang . " I know more now than I can understand . The more I know the deeper twists the bitterness . I trust no one , not even myself . Tories and Rebels , they both lie and lie how noble they are , how sacred their causes . On both sides false and cunning trickeries , crazy hate and defiance . Both sides wanted this war . Now they have it . Your Sam Adams wanted it . You followed him wanting it . Now you 've both got it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you say . " " A storm has come . It began far back . Sam Adams could n't bring it . It began before he was born . A voice , that 's all Sam Adams is . He says what we want said . " Robert put out a hand , clutched one of her wrists . " Before giving you the message and news I came to deliver , I 'm telling you the days to come will bring you lessons . I have no lesson for you . I leave it to time . I 'm not throwing any persuasions at you . I still value beyond price that fine sincerity of yours . " " So you say and it may be you know what you say and mean it . " Feet scuffing the plank walk outside , and Robert ran on tiptoe to the kitchen , and Mim answered the doorknock , in enough clear moonlightto know the face . " Lieutenant Frame ! Would you come in ? " " Thank you . " " I was just going upstairs . Enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . Seat yourself and I will go to the kitchen for candle-light . " She returned with the two stub candles lighted , set them on the table . " And now ? " " I have come on two matters . The first is official . " And Francisp517Frame was grave with a touch of severity though he had the peculiar moon-round face that puts on severity with effort . His having an acquaintance with her was the reason his superiors had sent him to get her solemn word that she was not playing the role of an informer , making reports to the Rebels of intelligence picked up among her Loyalist friends . She gave him as solemn word as he wanted that she was no informer . " Your association with the lawless and incendiary Robert Winshore has been intimate , has it not ? In fact , it has been rather generally accepted that you were bespoken to him for marriage , has it not ? " ' " That is true . " " Naturally it gave rise to suspicion , to uneasiness , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to a feeling that you might be a colaborer with him in his designs of violence and treason . " " If Mr. Winshore were here , he would testify that I have opposed his views and designs and have tried to prevail on him toward a different course of conduct . " " You may be assured , Miss Wilming , that it will be a pleasure for me to report that you have made these declarations and avowals . " " Avowals ? " " Is it not a solemn enough hour to term them avowals ? " " I presume so . I am not yet accustomed to these strict examinations . " He saw her his full equal in severity . Her eyes held austerity and she was n't trying . She now asked , " And what was the second matter , Lieutenant Frame ? " Now she felt sorry for him . This was the grief of a man hit hard . His voice shook . " A ball in the leg . . . my brother . . . yesterday . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said the sur-geons  --  " His lower lip hung loose . That and his moist eyes held the sorrow and pity , that and his thick voice . " Death , Miss Wilming , I am not sure but I would rather witness death than a major amputation . You may know the procedure , the ordeal , we might say . They bind him down fast with leather straps none of his struggles can break . They proceed with their knives for the flesh and the saw for the bone . In the beginning he moans and screams with the pain . Then he faints away and awakes to go through an agony of healing and then a cripple for life . " Before the operation "  --  and now Francis Frame was soft and tender , with no trace of severity  --  " my brother spoke of you . He said he might not come through . He wished to be remembered to you . He requested me to present to you his compliments and to say to you for him , Assure her that I hold her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . " " It is sad to hear , deeply sad . You must convey to him my respect and my affection . Give him the message that I speak prayers for hisp518recovery and his future . And I should be asking now , he will recover ? " " The surgeons believe so . They value his high courage , they say . " " And his future ? " " He leaves shortly for England . The fabrication of a substitute limb when amputation is above the knee has added difficulties . We hope now for his recovery . The plans for his career after that can wait . " Now Lieutenant Francis Frame paused . Mim said nothing . She saw on his face the fading of sorrow and pity and again the official look , his moon-round cheeks and chin trying for severity , accuracy , dispatch . " You have heard , Miss Wilming , that Robert Winshore was in the fighting yesterday ? " " No , it is news to me . " " As near as we gather it Winshore was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barn , perhaps gave him some slight assistance , then ran out of the barn , shot and killed one of our men and disappeared into the back fields . We have learned too that he was active in riding fields and woods between Lexington and Concord with powderand bullets for Rebels whose supplies were exhausted . We considerhim a dangerous man . " He paused . The nub of it was coming , Mim saw . His question came simple and direct as she might please . He was asking , " May I have your word , Miss Wilming , that if you hear or know of his return to Boston you will thereupon immediately notify us ? " " You speak with candor and with courtesy , Lieutenant Frame . And I appreciate that what you do is in line of duty . Yet you must know there is a stern severity and there are sharp implications underlyingyour words . What manner of a character have I become that you must pay an official call on me at my home in night hours to require a pledge from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A war began yesterday , Miss Wilming . Boston from this day is under the strictest martial law . The Rebels who killed our men yesterdaywant to kill more of us . It is our lives or theirs . They hunt down our spies and informers and we must hunt down theirs . This must be evident to you , Miss Wilming . It is nothing extreme under the circumstances that we require of you . " " I shall think it over , Lieutenant Frame , in every turn and viewpoint . You will find , I believe , that I shall not be lacking in due and solemn appreciation of what it is you desire . " " It is a matter where we can not stand on delay , Miss Wilming . " Mim rose and moved toward the door . Lieutenant Frame stood up , moved with her till they stood at the door . " I am asking you , Lieutenant Frame , I must ask you , to be so good as to come to this house tomorrow night . I shall then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not refuse it . I ask a day of time . It may be that I shall give you exactly the pledge you askp519and give you the fullest possible accommodation . Or it may be that I must follow some other course . It is a matter I must consider . " " I regret I must report to my superiors that I find you hesitant and quibbling . I had higher opinion of you . However I shall call on you at this house and the same hour tomorrow evening . " He bowed himself out the door and his polished high boots scrunched on the plank walk in the moonlight . On shadow feet Robert joined Mim at the shutters watching the black boots , the scarlet coattails , the blue three-cornered hat , turn off the gravel path and move up the street . Mim after a minute or two stepped out , walked to both corners , went round the house and up the alley in two directions , returned to the front room , to the chair opposite Robert on the settee . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little further we have to say . " " Do you remember , Mim , " Robert began , as much to himself as to her , and as though both of them were tired , bedazzled , . worn in the whirl of circumstance and what he was saying might help , " Do you remember the night on the green at Lexington in a sweet clean moonlight and we kissed once and kissed again , and later we stood still listening to the slow going down of a wind that an hour before had roared and whined around us as our skates curved on the moonlit pond ? Do you remember ? " Like the thud of a flat stone falling plunk into a quiet pool came Mim 's voice , " Is this your message ? Time counts . Is this the news you bring ? " Now he could n't fathom her . IIe had seen her step away from him more than once though never so far away . " I guess you 're right , Mim . I guess I ought n't be dreamy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought be asking you what 's got into you ? What the hell 's the matter with you ? " She too could n't quite fathom him . Now she said he had never been so far away from her . It was too far . It hurt enough for her to say , " You could be cruel to me , Robert . Once I thought nothing could ever happen where you could be cruel to me . That was before the Reggs affair and the Ludgate atrocity . " This he would n't meet . She could go farther with this and he would sit dumb . " Of course , " and she spoke loud now , she did n't care who heard her or who might come , " of course I remember the kisses on Lexington green and the hush on the snow that was a whisper of music only we two standing still in the moonlight could hear . That 's a memory , " she went on , " and when both of us clean forget it it will be a hell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as she crossed the room and came back with one hand in a clasp , " I did it for the sake of memories . There was an hour in a hazel thicket when we stood tiptoe together andp520plucked stars from the meadows of the sky and that was a memory . There was another hour we snuggled close in a wagon and tried to bring down a ring of brass chains circling the moon . " Now she was crying her words in a low swift murmur and Robert sat awe-struck and swept away by her . " Wear it , keep it in all weathers , " she said , her hand opening as she reached over , thrust a hand inside his coat and into his wool-shirt pocket . " I began making it weeks ago and went through with it and could n't think of keeping it for myself having you and the memories in mind every moment of stitching it . " His hands took it , unfolded and rolled it , clutched and caressed it , a large kerchief of thin blue silk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget me by , " she was saying . " To live pleasant , to skip the hard places with a light hurt , I might . be able to do it , Mini . " " So that 's the message you came at danger to yourself to deliver . " " If you care to take it as a message  --  and I wish I had n't had to come . " " If there is more , tell it . You ca n't pile grief too high this night . " His pause was long . He would have liked to be whisked away . he should have made excuses to her mother and not promised . And it was baffling she had n't rushed questions at him about the reports flying over Boston of the fighting at Lexington and Concord yesterday , why she was n't asking who , what , when , where , and how did it happen among the neighbors of her youth and childhood . That perhaps was her pride , her clinging to her notion that he should n't have gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the press of suspicion and official questioning of her had done something . Her guess ran he had some last plea for her to join in works for the Sons of Liberty . She knew there was a light dash of evil in her now mocking , " We have heard of a man risking his life to bring a message to be spoken and then at the final moment forgetting the words , " adding as he still sat in his long pause , " There were evenings less dangerous when we said , We ca n't stay here all night . ' " " Marintha . " It was both a whisper and a groan . She caught herself sobered and awed , threw it off , and mocked , " Yes , that 's the name , you remember the name . " " Marintha , " and Robert found himself trying to speak with a disembodiedvoice , in words detached , monotonous as the regular pendulumof an impersonal clock telling the time to the just and the unjust . " Marintha , yesterday morning the goddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shattered the right arm of your father and with another lead ball of evil aim they killed your brother Darius . " In the dim light of the moon through the shutters , she could n't read his face as she arose , as she stopped in her pacing to and fro . It wasp521too amazing and shocking to be true . It was one more lie flung into the tangles and turmoils of illusion with which her brain had wrestled in days just passed . She stood before him , dazed , not certain she heard . Iie gave it to her again , shorter as a statement , and again detached , monotonous as the inevitable brass pendulum of time to the just and the unjust : " They crippled your good father for life and they murdered your sweet and brave brother Darius . I stood at the bedside and saw him cI e and heard his last words and what he said was , The pain is gone . Tell Mim I will go far down the pleasant valley and meet her with a kiss . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front window . She stood looking and half seeing through the shutters and half seeing the moonwhite on the grass , on the plank walk , on the cedar branches . She turned , walked two steps feeling the way with slow feet , stood silent toward Robert a long moment . Then he saw her sway and crumpleto the rag rug on the floor before he could reach her . He ran to the kitchen for a dipper of water , laid a wet kerchief over her forehead , eyes and face , saw her eyelids flutter and slowly open , saw her coming to , heard her faintly , " Take me home , Robert Winshore , take me home . You took me too far away . Now take me back . " The eyes settled in quiet , little bars of moonlight from the shutters marking her face , the eyelashes still , her tongue moistening the lower lip , and her words Robert could n't get clear till at the end of a pleading , " You would n't fool me , Robert , you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , " You would n't fool me , Robert . " She lifted her head , raised her shoulders , sank back , with closed eyes seemed to rest , seemed near sleep . Then she pushed at him , wanting him away and not touching her , sat up , straightened herself and shook her head and held it high , gave a ripple of wild laughter as she faced the ceiling . Then came her words spinning out in ripples . She was laughing it . " Now Marintha Wilming is herself again , Robert Winshore . Marintha the bright child with her skates on Lexington green listening to the wind go down , the tall proud howling stallion of a wind become a wee mouse of a , vanishing zephyr , we heard it and what of it , sir , I ask , what of it ? " She moved into a heady mockery , a tipsy groping . " What a delightfulevening , sir . What a marvelous night we have had , sir , what conversations with the shadows of barn rats and man-killers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the pleasant valley and meet his sister with a kiss . And an arm off here and a leg off there and an arm off here and a leg off there  --  it 's like you can drum it on drums of fate  --  dead in the morning still dead in the afternoon and when the evening stars creep out and look down dead and still dead  --  an arm off here and a leg off there and when a leg comes off he screams tillp522he forgets his leg is coming off , he ca n't see , he ca n't hear his leg is coming off . And if your lover comes it is your duty to tell us your lover has come . He is a dangerous man , a lawless incendiary , and we want our hand on him , tell us when he comes so we may put our hands on him , the rat , the foul and squeaking rat . What smooth and conniving silhouette of warships on the horizon brought them ? And - whither goest thou , me lad , and thinkest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripples of a tipsy abandon it came from her . She paused and it came slow with a shiver of amazement at her bones . " What sweet angels of fathomless doom have overheard our kind words to each other this night , sir ? " Then again swiftly . " Apples , how many the times Darius and I picked a big red apple , so handsome an apple , and put our teeth into it to find it a mushy wallow of neither taste nor content . And again we met windfalls of scrawny little pippins with no reputation and we filled our mouths with them and glutted ourselves with their scrawny little perfections . " Small moonbars through the shutters rested on her head and Robert saw the burnish of her chestnut hair as airy slats of fine bronze . Iler hair had come loose on one side and broken ropes of it lay on the wide white linen collar of her left shoulder . Now she was far beyond him . He would hesitate at touching her . She was so far away , he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would n't be there and his hand would be still reaching towardher into empty air . Time counted . And it did n't . What did they have more of than time for speaking the finalities that hung in the air , for saying what they could not say in the long time , the looming stretch of time ahead of them ? Mim scrambled to her feet , stood at the window , looked out . " Here we can see who might come to listen to our chitchat , our elegant and amusing chitchat . " She bowed , curtsied in mimicry of courtesy and went on smoothand broken , broken and smooth . " Having broken a heart , would youcare to pick up the pieces , sir , and put them in a little snuffbox to carryaway , to gaze at early or late standing perhaps among yellow pie-eyeddaisies , pigweed , ragweed , sow thistle in a cow-pasture fence corner ? Or you might give them to an auctioneer and hear him , What canI get to start this ? A broken heart  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bid ? Yes , all the pieces of a broken heart in a littleoblong of silver and you can take it in your hand and say with seamusic , if you can manage it , I remember her , I do , I do , I do , rememberremember her and the bits of shadowcreep woven in her thistledownhair , I remember a warm lingering kiss she gave me on Lexington greenp523one night when a brass moonfall came down and a white snowfall drifted on our shoulders . " In her pause she made a grotesque mouth . " I 'm a clown , always a clown you have found me . How can there be a brass moonfall and a white snowfall at the same time ? There must be a mistake somewhere . Yes , there must be a grave error , some figure in the arithmetic of Boston streets and Lexington green got lost and was n't there when they added , subtracted , multiplied and divided and especially divided . " It was wearing her down , losing its weave and timebeat . She was asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a naught , a zero , a goose egg , an oval of no promise , no crimson or folly , no bright seduction , deaths instead of weddings , deaths on deaths instead of wedding after wedding ? " She took three quick steps toward the center table , staggered , stood heady and swaying . Robert stepped toward her . She drew back and away , her hands out as though she would push him away . What of fantasy rushed from her now he afterward saw in a dream as a relentlessline of white flame destroying itself , eaten , going and gone as it reached an equally relentless black pool of green scum . She would have it so . " Listen , sir . Let your ears gather my farewell to you , sir . In the sacredname of all the crowning apple blossoms of next June , I promise to forget you . So completely will I put you out of my mind you may know you will not be the least of my thoughts because you will not be among any of my thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall stand at the grave of my brother on a Sabbath of gray rain and blowing mist and I shall bless his name and bless his curly brown head of hair and bless his slow brown eyes of faith that never betrayed man , woman , nor beast of burden . But you , sir , I shall forget . Letter by letter I shall forget your name till I can not remember how to spell it . " Robert saw the very tumult and rioting freedom of her speech had its music of consolation for her , had eased awful and inexplicable thorns piercing her . She now measured slow words . " A dark and tangledwonder has happened that can never be solved . I would have brought you flagons and chasubles , moonmist and rainbows . Instead I brought you the trifle of a kerchief of blue silk , silk for you to remember my heart was made soft as moonmist , and the blue of it blue as a blue moon shining on a blue sea for you to remember me by . And you , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of barter , by way of a bargain ? Why , you brought me the pains of death and the aches of hell . " She swayed . Robert caught her fall . He held her in his arms on the settee . She sobbed in his arms . He went because there was no mistakingher command . " Do n't pity me . I 'll do my own pitying . Go now , Robert Winshore . Go and stay gone . I must forget you . The forgetting will come hard but I will forget . "  |p524You  Can not Conquer a MapMICHAEL McGILLICUDDY had come to the back door of the house , knocked softly , and Jean Shepherd had let him in . She had given him a cut of pork pie , a warm swig from a bottle of rum without letting him have the bottle , and sent him to the cellar . He would eat and wait there while she finished cooking and serving the supper . It was ten days since she had seen him . " Michael my man , where for God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And his story was that for being drunk , disorderly and fighting with a night watchman , he was arrested and given ten days in Philadelphia city prison , the jail . That was all . The rest of it he would tell her after supper when he helped her wash the dishes . Down the cellar he went . Jean Shepherd believed him . His pockmarked and ruddy face looked thin , his gray eyes wild and bloodshot . His blue-and-white worsted stockings were torn and hung in tatters . His new shoes were gone and in their place a scuffed pair full of holes . Worse yet his buckskin breeches were gone and in their place a cloth pair in tatters . Either he had been in the city jail or some corner of Philadelphia as evil , thought Jean . Most likely it was the jail . She believed him . IIe would tell her later . " It 's a God 's shame , the way the poor man looks , " she was saying . Jean cut the pork pie in portions so it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set it on the table for the two men and two women , set dishes of carrots , buttered parsnips , wheat bread , cheese , cider . When they had finished these victuals , helping themselves , Jean brought on an apple pie and coffee . When they had gone to the front room Jean called down the cellar and Michael McGillicuddy came up . They were a couple , each five feet three inches in height . He was a thick ranting man and she plump and lusty . He drank hard and amazed her at the liquor he could carry . She smoked a clay pipe , bowl after bowl every day , and took snuff between-times , and her black underteeth did n't show when she smiled . The jail had a big stone-walled room with iron doors , Michael told her , all prisoners packed in this one room . No sooner had the watch pushed him through the door of this room than they rushed him . " Likep525a pack of hungering dogs they hurled themselves on me , showing their teeth like dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shoes and all . They stood him naked in a corner by himself . His clothes would come to him after he said they could have his few coins for the jailkeeper to bring in rum and gin . He said Yes and would like now to kill the two fellows who brought him his clothes and let him know his buckskin breeches and new pair of shoes were good for drink money and he would get along with the old shoes and tattered breeches they handed him . He could have fought them one by one " but they were in league against me and I would have to fight them all to oncet  --  so now , Jean , I look like a beggar , I know I do and it 's the will of God . " His hands trembled , his eyes had fear , remembering the big room with young men and old , boys and girls , wrecks of women , crowded together , with straw over the stone floor to sleep on and scarce room for all to lie down at night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away from them . In wide leather buckets they voided excrement , at daybreak those not in favor with the jailkeeper took their turns at emptying the buckets . The farthest end of the room , in the lingo of inmates hardened to the place , was termed " the stink corner " or " the shit stall . " There night and day lay a woman who had been in nearly a year and two men who had served a year and a half . Under their rotting ragged clothes could be seen scabs and gray-backed lice , cracks of yellow flesh open with filth , and a heavy odor , a reek and stench . " You should meet the likes of the same in any other place , " Michael was saying , " you would puke at the sight and not berate yourself for pukin . But in jail you kept yourself from pukin unless it would be you wanted them to kick you in the backsides for a faintheart and for lackin the guts of a man . " Michael talked between mouthfuls of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wolfed his food before Jean . Ten days of hard foul bread morning and evening , a thin soup at noon , " rather made me forget the taste of food . " Jean told him : " Now beware of overfillin , t would make ye sick . " Those three in the corner , the woman and the two men in their filth and misery , said Michael , there were some of the others who would look at them as though they were many many miles below somewhere . " They looked so low you believed men and women could n't sink lower and not be in hell itself . " The woman sat up to the extent of her head on an elbow one day and Michael heard a bloat-faced younger woman ask her what she was in for . The answer came , " I 'm a slut men do n't want any more , you bitch you , " and she tried to spit at the questioner . " Her mouth drooled having lost the strength to spit , " said Michael . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , Michael , " said Jean.  |p526  " I do be thinkin , Jean , " said Michael , a smile with a warm glow over him . " You 'll be a new man soon . " " I 'm a new man now , Jean , what with you and the food . " He put an arm around her , gave her a thumping kiss and a slap on a buttock , took a dishtowel and joined her at wiping dishes , prancing to put them in place on a cupboard shelf . The door to the kitchen opened and the man of the house and his woman stepped in . " You near scairt me , Mrs. Winshore , " said Jean who now could n't be scared at the pleasantly mischievous faces that had come , and asking , " Did you hear ? Did you listen to us ? " " No , we came to say good night and did n't know you had company . " " You 've seen Michael here before , you know how the two of us are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other times . " " If you 'd listened you 'd know why the likes of him is so different . " Then Ordway Winshore and his wife Mary Burton Winshore brought in chairs and seated themselves while Jean and Michael went on with the dishwiping and Michael saying a sorry fool he was that he did get drunk and that he did act disorderly and he should n't have struck the watchman a blow that felled him  --  but the city prison , had Mr. Winshore ever seen that room where they keeps ' em ? " Only from the outside , Michael , though I 'm not sure but I will see it or a place like it one of these days . " Michael told his story , with the comment once , " I 'm not a man to shrink from evil , Mr. Winshore . I 've seen much of evil that was n't all evil by far . But that big room with the young and old , menfolk and women , two girls just off the streets and runnin sores on their faces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the room and goin out to rot the jailkeeper , the town watchman , and fine folk who have never seen the place . The deep rot I smelled there , Mr. Winshore , Mrs. Winshore , I know it spreads beyond our knowin . " He had forgotten about his dishtowel and the drying , his gray eyes wild and bloodshot , tears in his shrill swift voice . There was more . He might find work to his liking . Yet even if he did he might think it better to go northward and fight with the army of General Washington . Part of it was he liked the idea of America being free and independent . And the other part , he spoke it more directlytoward Jean , " I think I 'll end in the fightin , macushla . My father was a fightin man and his father . The , McGillicuddys have ever been fightin men . " The Winshores said good night . They would talk of it further tomorrow . Mrs. Winshore was sure she could find shoes and breeches " more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need them . " " I 'll see he has a place to sleep , " said Jean with a nod toward Michael and looking Mrs. Winshore straight in the eyes . " And I 'll do my bestp527at comfortin him . " ' With that Jean reached for tobacco leaves , crushed them to fill her clay pipe and began sucking at her good-night smoke . Henry Tozzer and his wife were the couple having supper with the Winshores that evening . It was a year and more since Ordway and Mary Burton Winshore , newly married in Boston , had visited the Tozzers in New York . A year now and there were names come out of nowhere to burn with meaning , words that meant death and scars and the letters of them spelled as with scarlet on snow and with black embers in spotlesswhite ashes . Names  --  Bunker Hill , where the farmers met the Regulars and stood their ground till their powder and shot ran out and Joseph Warren died swearing " the proud disdain " he had sung in his verses of " free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lexington , Concord , Boston , the Continental Army  --  and George Washingtonstrange , quiet , solid , responsible , the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army , his name a hope , not yet written in blood color . The Continental Army , authorized by the Continental Congress , swarmed to Boston , for months pinning the enemy army prisoner in that city , at last planting its cannon where they could sweep the enemy warships . The Continental Army in March of 1776 moved nearer and fortified and again moved up and fortified till the enemy saw it must surrender or sail away and it chose to sail away taking a thousand New England Loyalists to Canada . Now the fighting was to come around New York to see who would hold that city . Around that port the Continental Army was moving to meet the enemy . " Your boy Locke is with them , " Tozzer had said . " And my boy Robert , " Winshore had added softly . " I saw Locke after what they did to Rivington , he was in it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . He is a courier and on some duty came down from the Boston siege on his horse . You should see Locke on a horse . He 's a good one . You could think he had been on horses all his life , the way he rides . His face has the outdoor weather on it . Maybe he should n't be a printer . " " And you say he was in the Rivington affair ? " " In Connecticut riding back to Boston he meets Captain Sears , CaptainIsaac Sears you know , the Sons of Liberty leader Rivington was always picking at . And Locke rides with Sears and seventy-five men on horses , with guns and pistols . They ride on down to Manhattan Island , on into New York till they line up in front of Rivington 's place . What are you going to do ? ' people asked . One man on a horse yelled , We 're going to wreck the damned lying Gazetteer and then we 're goingto hang Rivington . ' Rivington was away . He had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture and Mr. Rivington 's personal walnut desk . And they carried away every font of type in the place  --  by now that lead is run off into bullets . And they say Rivington is not showing himself and some say he is gone back to England . Locke was one of the men who went into the building . He said he was glad to give Rivington such a dose but he is a good enough printer so he did n't like to see a good press smashed . " Tozzer had come to Philadelphia , after selling his press and type ill New York " to pay my debts or go to the debtor 's cell in the jail , " as he said , and done well with the printer Bell in Philadelphia . The pressworkhad been heavy on a pamphlet which was really a small-sized book . On its publication in January thousands of copies had been sold , passed around , " read to pieces . " More and more editions had been run off the press of R. Bell and by summer they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for talk and tumultuous excited discussion , by summer it would go to a hundred thousand copies . Tozzcr had enjoyed the heavy work of getting out one edition after another . " The book says what I wanted somebody to say and it is like a miracle such a book could come now so terribly needed . " " The cause of America is in a great measure the cause of all mankind , " said the introduction . " The principles of all lovers of mankind are affected , and . . . their affections interested . " The eyes of the world were on America and what she did had " universal " rather than " local " interest . The outside world , neither Britain nor Europe , could conquerAmerica , " if she does not conquer herself by delay and timidity . " The writer quoted Milton : " Never can true reconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep . " And was it absurd or not to suppose a continent to be perpetually governed by an island ? He was certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not govern us . " he was tired of " always running three or four thousand miles with a tale or a petition , waiting four or five months for an answer , which , when obtained , requires five or six more to explain it in . " This method of America conducting its trade and politics " will in a few years be looked upon as folly and childishness . There was a time when it was proper , and there is a proper time for it to cease . " They belonged to different systems , " England to Europe ; America to itself . " He had wished for reconciliation , the author of this little book . Then came " the fatal nineteenth of April , 1775 . " From then on he was through with the King of England . " I rejected the hardened , sullentemperedPharaoh of England for ever ; and disdain the wretch , that with the pretended title of FATHER OF HIS PEOPLE , can unfeelingly hear of their slaughter . . . is he , or is he not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall make no laws but what I please ! ' ? " Then again came the writer 's recurring theme . He began and finished with it . America now could set herself free and show to the world its first great republic of free men  --  the same vision Joseph Warren sang inp529his verses and then dying at Bunker Hill to prove he meant them . " Every spot of the old world is overrun with oppression . Freedom hath been hunted round the Globe . Asia and Africa have long expelled her . Europe regards her like a stranger , and England bath given her warning to depart . 0 ! receive the fugitive , and prepare in time an asylum for mankind . " The religious liberty to be seen in America foreshadowed farther and wider liberty . " I fully and conscientiously believe , that it is the will of the Almighty , that there should be a diversity of religious opinions among us . It affords a larger field for our Christian kindness . . . . I look on the various denominations among us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in what is called their Christian names . " As between reconciliation and war for independence he could see no other course than the war . " Our backwardness tends only to prolong the war . " Tozzer had been reading some of these pages and sentences . The Winshores agreed with him that the wide reading of the book , copies passed around and " read to pieces , " the Tories angered by it , the Rebels pleased at seeing their case and their arguments as beyond the enemy 's answering  --  this had helped make opinion and lay the way for the colonies to stand up before the world and through their ContinentalCongress declare themselves free and independent states . Till this was done the Americans still , in law , stood before other nations as subjects of Britain and therefore rebels . " Until an independance is declared , " said the book , " the Continent will feel itself like a man who , continues putting off some unpleasant business from day to day , yet knows it must be done , hates to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the thoughts of its necessity . " " God , how true are those words ! " said Winshore as Tozzer read them . The long curving slash of his mouth had a twist that made Tozzer say , " I never saw you look so sad , Mr. Winshore . " " It 's a sad business . Until we speak out and tell the world we are a free people and an independent nation we are fooling ourselves . Other nations believe our faith in ourselves slack . " The February edition of the little book came with an appendix that Winshore liked . Taking the pamphlet from Tozzer he read a paragraph that he said had deeply moved him . Should independence arrive by the legal voice of the people in the elected Continental Congress , then : " We have every opportunity and every encouragement before us , to form the noblest , purest constitution on the face of the earth . We have it in our power to begin the world over again . A situation , similar to the present , bath not happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new world is at hand , and a race of men , perhaps as numerousas all Europe contains , are to receive their portion of freedom . " The two printers laughed over Winshore 's copy of the first edition of the book with its title page readingp530COMMON SENSEaddressed to theINHABITANTS of AMERICAwritten by an ENGLISHMAN " Later he thought it would be better to have his name on it , " laughed Tozzer . " Thomas Paine ' went on those later editions . IIe do n't like it , Mr. Winshore . Peak-faced , lean like he was hungry , and his face like he had come from his books and his thinking and would never get to write it all . His dark-blue eyes , I think it is them that has him , deep eyes with funny shadows like you might kill him but could n't change his mind if he made it up . He smokes and drinks and he can talk like a streak but my guess is he is a dreamer and dreams much . " " I would venture , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself he would like to put on paper dreams so immense that men would say they could fight and die for such dreams . " " That is the gist of it , Mary , " said Winshore . " He dreams of an America that could stand as a light and an example to the rest of the world . Of course those are dream sentences no hard and practical man could write . They hold the vision of a zealot writing a testament . " " I believe he has with his dreams reached dreamers who will fight , " Winshore went on . " But he is not all dreams . Cold hard logic too he has . His pamphlet is not mishmash or we would n't hear of Ben Franklin and General Washington saying it has worked to good effects . " After the Tozzers had gone and after the talk with Jean and Michael in the kitchen , Winshore spoke to Mary of his wish that the Paine pamphlet could have mentioned the people in America having no hate for the people of Britain , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hunted out a copy of a letter Ben Franklin wrote last October to a friend in England . " No one has put the American cause of the past year so clearly , in so few words , " he said to Mary as he read her the letter : " We have as yet resolved only on defensive measures . If you would recall your forces and stay at home , we should meditate nothing to injure you . A little time so given for cooling on both sides would have excellent effects . But you will goad and provokeus . You despise us too much ; and you are insensible of the Italian adage , that there is no little enemy . I am persuaded that the body of the British people are our friends , but they are changeable , and by your lying gazettes may soon be made our enemies . Our respect for them will proportionably diminish , andp531I see clearly we are on the high road to mutual family hatred and detestation . A separation of course will be inevitable . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hitherto been engaged in , for increasing strength and empire with public felicity , would be destroyed by the mangling hands of a few blundering ministers . It will not be destroyed ; God will protect and prosper it , you will only exclude yourselves from any share in it . ' We hear , that more ships and troops are coming out . We know , that you may do us a great deal of mischief , and are determined to bear it patiently as long as we can . But , if you flatter yourselves with beating us into submission , you know neither the people nor the country . " Two phrases in that letter haunt me , " said Winshore . " They carry terrible meanings . Your lying gazettes ' is one . They will use language and print to make their people hate our people . Whether we win or lose the war the poison of hate spread by the lying gazettes will last for generations and play its part in still more wars . And that other phrase , the mangling hands of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places say Yes , say No , say Wait , say Do n't . They dillydally , mangle and blunder  --  and the war comes . " Winshore spoke of John Adams rating the First Continental Congress " one-third Whig ; another Tory ; the rest mongrel . " Washington 's troops at Boston had only five rounds of ammunition apiece against sixty of the enemy , he had learned . And toward the end of the siege of Boston , of twenty-one thousand men in the Continental Army , twenty-seven hundred were sick and unfit for duty . After taking Boston , thousands quit the army as though the war for them was over , went home or drifted here and there . For the march to New York Washington had only eight thousand men . " I 'm with you in your gloom , " said Mary . " We 'll see what we 'll see . She reminded him of their brief call on Ben Franklin one evening and how the seventy-year-old man had spoken in gloom of the obstacles ahead , sat with a grave face under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down over his ears to the coat collar , his shrewd and kindly eyes suddenly twinkling from behind the spectacles . Either in the history of nations or in personal lives , one must consider the role of completely unexpected events , said Franklin , " like the proud girl who wished and resolved not to marry a parson , nor a Presbyterian , nor an Irishman , and at length found herself married to an Irish Presbyterian parson . A rain blew up and they could hear it beating on the slope of the shingled roof so near their pillows . They were slow going to sleep . And their sleep was not easy . He had two boys out with the ContinentalArmy . For years he had brought them along , closer to themp532than any others . And those boys loved this human cause , they were ready to give all for this American Revolution . Like a boiling caldron was this Revolution into which had been poured many elements and materials . What would be there when the fire died down and after one crisis following another there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heat ? Not even the wisest could tell . The Winshores listening to the blowing rain on the shingles had the same wonder and humility , the same hope and philosophy as John Adams of Massachusetts , delegate to the Continental Congress sitting then in Philadelphia , who wrote that month : " Such mighty revolutions make a deep impression on the minds of men , and set many violent passions at work . Hope , fear , joy , sorrow . love , hatred , malice , envy , revenge , jealousy , ambition , avarice , resentment , gratitude , and every other passion , feeling , sentiment , principle , and imagination , were never in more lively exercise than they are now , from Florida to Canada inclusively . May God in His providence overrulethe whole for the good of mankind . It requires more serenity of temper , a deeper understanding , and more courage than fell to the lot of Marlborough , to ride this whirlwind . " One great vague hope they had . They could sense that hope in every seafog from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope rooted in an instinct born of knowing those fogs and winds , and living with them , breathing them , tasting them , on American shores and hills . Geography , ai ai , geography and time might yet win them the war . A continent they had to fight on  --  and centuries of time , as much of time as there was in the future . Land , they had land enough for six or eight Europes . Pitt in telling it to Parliament and the King 's ministers , packed it in five words : " You can not conquer a map . " The ministers laughed it off as though , " This laconic ass makes brevity ridiculous . " He was brilliant and this was one more of his epigrams . The ministers rated hint , Pitt , an astute politician jockeying for place rather than a historian trying to tell them a portentous geographic and military fact : " You can not conquer a map . " Was it the wind and the rain or did he hear a knocking at the front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard knuckles on that front door downstairs . It might be either Locke or Robert . He slid out of bed and went down , opened the door and saw  --  no one . He slept and two dream flashes came to him . In one he saw Locke bent low over a horse riding in the night , riding in rain and wind . In the other he saw Robert , lean and down to hard bone , worn and pale , sleeping by a fire , wrapped in his blanket sleeping and his hat and blanket covered by the white snowfall.  |p533THEY  were tall sun-browned hard fellows and the bigger one had said , " Bobby me lad , we 've got a country , have n't we ? " " Sure , that 's what we 're fightin for , our country . " " But we have n't told the world we 're a country , have we ? " " Not yet but that 's comin . They ca n't hold it off much longer . The Continental Congress has got to declare us an independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow . " " Molasses in January , says I. " " New England has a flag with a lone pine tree in a corner . " " And South Carolina , " chimed Bobby , " has a flag with a coiledrattlesnake ready to bite and a sign under him , Do n't Tread on Me . ' " " And America has no flag . " " That 's what we 're laughin about , is it , Bobby ? " " Yes , Oat , and more like it we can laugh about . " " Like what ? " " Like havin an army and no uniforms , " said Bobby . " That 's better than uniforms and no army . " " I 'll laugh with you about that , " and Bobby did . Then a glum Bobby , " An army without powder ? Can we laugh about that ? " " No , it worries the General . We lost Bunker Hill when we ran out of powder and did n't even have bayonets to meet theirs . " " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country yet , no flag , no uniforms , Bunker Hill with no powder , no bayonets . How do we do it ? " Oat grinned . " We 're just naturally pestiferous , thorny , and stubborn , even among ourselves . I heard one fellow say , We 'll hang on till we drop and then look around to see what hit us . ' It 's our ignorance scares the enemy . We was ignorant at Lexington and Concord and killed nearly double of them what they did of us and we did the same at Bunker Hill . If they came out of Boston now they could shoot till we had no more to shoot . They do n't know that . They 're ignorant . We 're ignorant . And our ignorance so far works out better than theirs . " " Could we have a laugh at General Henry Knox , the artillery chief who lacks nothing but artillery ? " " Jolly , reliable three-hundred-pound Henry Knox , he 'll get cannon ,  |p534my  bones tell me . And he 'll plant ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Can that be more of our ignorance , Oat ? " " Time is on our side , Bobby . " " How much time have we ? " " Heard an Indian say once , we 've got all the time there is . " These two on the headquarters staff of General George Washington at Cambridge , Massachusetts , Sergeant Robert Winshore and Sergeant Oates Elwood , in the summer of 1775 had been well over the lines and camps of the Continental Army that half-circled Boston and hemmed in the enemy army . They had seen twenty thousand men arrive in the towns and coon try outlying Boston , only the Rhode Island volunteers in tents , some with their firelocks and blankets sleeping in Harvard College buildings , in the Episcopal Church and private homes of Cambridge , but the most of them dotting the fields and hidden in woods in shelters their own hands made , huts from boards picked up and sailcloth canvas , shanties of stone and of sod , still others of logs and twisted branches and withes . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : American Army English Army1 . Seven dollars a month . 1 . Threepence a day. 2 . Fresh provisions in plenty . 2 . Rotten salt pork. 3 . Health .. 3 . The scurvy. 4 . Freedom , ease , affluence , and 4 . Slavery , beggary , and want . a good farm . Pickets had thrown this handbill , wrapped in a stone , over to enemy pickets . Deserters came from the enemy . The British commander put a stop to it by shooting one they caught trying to desert . Sergeants Elwood and Winshore laughed . " Why do we laugh ? " asked Sergeant Elwood . " Because we do n't get seven dollars a month unless it 's paid and we hear troops cursing because it is n't paid . Because one day we get fresh provisions and another day we do n't . Because our camp fever spreads and about one man in ten is on the sick list and the army health grows worse . Because none of us will have freedom , case , affluence , and a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why do we laugh ? " " We laugh because we might do our cryin later , Oat . And we laugh because the enemy lies to us and we show we can lie as good as the enemy . " " Might be that 's it . They 're good liars and we 're better . " " That 's war , Oat. "  |p535They  laughed too over ragged barefooted American soldiers desertingto the enemy and slipping back into the Continental Army lines and you could see them now here and there in long-tailed red coats and new shoes and nobody cared and it was taken as comical that they wore the uniform of the enemy they were fighting though of course there was a curiosity about whether in a battle they would n't get shot at by Americans who took them for redcoats inasmuch as they wore red coats . As one of them smeared his red coat with juice of walnut and butternut hulls , his Yankee nasal singsong ran , " I dye for my country . " They sobered talking about General George Washington . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him names but the names would n't be funny . Sergeants Winshore and Elwood slept in a third-floor room with a dormer , Washington on the second floor , the headquarters on the ground floor . They had seen Washington pour water from a china pitcher into a china washbowl and rub his face with soaped hands . Robert once brought him a mug of hot water and saw him lather his face , strop a razor and shave . Both had heard him curse when he knocked over a bottle of ink and it ran on a document , hearing him at once recover himself and apologize to them . " Sometimes I think , " said Elwood , " when he looks so wonderful frozen-faced he tries to act more frozen-faced because he ca n't let loose the fire of wrath burnin away under in him . " " What is there about him you know it is n't cold but you would n't touch him , you would n't dare get familiar , and you can be in the same room with him and he seems far off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the eye and you go out and risk your neck for him ? " " We 've both done that , Bobby , have n't we ? " " He stays with you when you go away from him . " " When I look at him he seems to be saying something without talking . I do n't get tired lookin at him . " Washington stood six foot three , compact , well built , with his two hundred and twenty pounds of weight , naturally erect like a straightgrowntree , moving with the ease of a man who had been around horses all his life , had broken wild colts and owned stallions that guaranteed foal . " Owns a hundred slaves and more land than any other man in the colonies , " said Robert . " That 's what they say . And he was n't sure about fighting for Independence till months after Lexington . He came to it slow . " " When he did he came with all he had . " " Just like John Hancock . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boiled owl at John Adams for not nominating Hancock to be Commander-in-Chief . "  |p536  " What I hear , too , " said Elwood , " Hancock never heard a bullet whiz in his life and never slept on the ground , never was ambushed by Indians , like Washington . " " Did you hear the General first week when a brigadier talked about what he calls our problem of vermin ? " " And the General said he once slept on straw in a backwoods hut and the lice and fleas weighed more than the blanket . " " Yes , the General nearly smiled . He meant we are a lousy army but he has seen lousier conditions . " " And he nearly smiled . That 's peculiar in his make-up , ai n't it ? I 've never seen him smile and many times I 've seen him nearly smile . " And Robert saying it tried to put on a near-smile like the General 's . " Sentencin a private to sit straddle a rail for hours where the other privates came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Elwood was grim as the General . " And the gantlet , makin a man run the gantlet , two lines of soldiers givin his ass their gun butts  --  you ca n't smile about that . " " The General do n't like it . He sees days we 're more a mob than an army . I heard him say every private in this army thinks he 's a general . " " We 're lucky to be on headquarters duty sleepin in a feather bed with clean sheets . " Robert felt guilty about his comfort . " If our post was out among Liberty Boys we know , fellows that tarred and feathered Tory king-kissers and toadeaters , it might be we 'd join them in what they call mutiny when those old Liberty Boys ca n't have what they want . When they say liberty ' they mean it and to hell with officers , even their own army officers . Discipline ai n't for them yet . Restrictions , they say to hell with restrictions , and what we 're fightin for is freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , new and flashy , was the uniform of the Commander-in-Chief . A cocked hat of blue with a black cockade on it , high top boots , buff breeches he wore , a blue coat with buff trimmings , five buttons running down each side and of those ten buttons only two , on the left side , in use as buttons , the other eight for decoration , the other eight to look at . On epaulettesfastened to the shoulders fringes of gilt hung clown . Faded and drab from years of wear this uniform did n't tell for sure who was in it . So headquarters announced you would know the Commander-in-Chief by " a light blue ribband wore across his breast between his Coat and Waistcoat , " while major and brigadier generals would be seen each with a pink ribband . When you met a pink cockade in a hat , it was a field officer , yellow or buff meant a captain . This was the time Winshore and Elwood sewed a stripe of red cloth to the right shoulders . That ought to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found guilty of cowardice at Bunker Hill , General Washington signing his approval of the court-martial findingsp537that an officer " be cashiered for cowardice , " the General writing he did it " with inexpressible concern , " these troubles added to what the enemy gave . The General had to break men as he had broken horses in his time . He mentioned two officers he " broke , " their names " CaptainParker of Massachusetts for Frauds both in Pay , and Provisions , and Captain Gardiner of Rhode Island for Cowardice in running away from his Guard on an Alarm . " A captain " abusing " his major drew a reprimand , a captain guilty of throwing his men into the guardhouse and snarling at them without proper cause , not to mention his drawing more provisions than he was entitled to , another captain letting civiliansand most anybody pass through his lines  --  General Washington approved the court-martial findings . A sergeant with disrespect for the Continental Congress , who lifted a glass in a toast to the enemy commander , what should be done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sergeant rode in a cart with a rope around his neck and an escort of drummers and soldiers who hooted him out of the camp and told him never show his face again among Americans . Soldiers of New England regiments left camp , without leave , to work on their own farms or the farms of their officers . At headquarters they knew Washington termed this " base and pernicious " and the men " infamous deserters and defrauders . " The General gave it out publicly that this was unbelievable conduct , scandalous , and he would pay no attention to " insinuations " but from now on if he caught any of them at it he would " show no favor to any officer guilty of such iniquitous practices . " From headquarters later went the order of the Commander-in-Chief taking notice of " repeated instances of officers , who , lost to every sense of honor and virtue , are seeking by dirty and base means , the promotion of their own dishonest gain , to the eternal disgrace of themselves and dishonor of their country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never be overlooked . " Sergeant Winshore found himself coming under a quiet influence he had met before . In the presence of Washington or in thinking about the man and remembering his face , his ways and his silence rather than his speech , Robert felt the same thing he had seen on the faces of certain Minute Men , a certain section of the Sons of Liberty . Ile told Elwood , " You could say it 's a divine zeal on his face or unconquerable will or absolute and holy resolves  --  and that sounds like gab talk and you 're huntin for words to say something that ca n't be said . I have n't seen the man warm to me yet I warm to him . And so do you , Oat . You 'd go out and do things that look crazy and impossible because he told you to . And I guess you do it because you know he 'd do the same thing if somebody could take his place as the Chief . " " Not a crooked bone in his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I end up thinkin he knows he 's slow and he knows he'sp538not bright . And that I say is an advantage . I 'd rather have him where he is than a man too sure he 's fast and satisfied he 's bright . " " Oat , you 've been thinkin . That 's part of why we trust him so . He 'll make one mistake after another before we give him up . " From the country around flocked in relatives and friends , curiosity seekers come to see warriors . One day came Ann Elwood , having left Boston at risk , taking on duties as a cook and mending woman for ragged soldiers . When there was spare time Robert Winshore sought Ann , enjoyed company with her , came to admire her shadowy hair , her deep and wide-open gray eyes . IIe kissed her , found soothing and warmth in her kisses . He made her no promises , felt he owed it to her and her brother there should be no promises . He dug into himself saying the companionship had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more careful . Yet what she gave him softened a bitter lonelinessthat ran in him , and his telling himself he would stay away from her did n't work out , and . his saying he would make no promises began to take on a color of wrong and it hurt him and he felt tangled with a shade of shame to the tangle . They had a three-hour walk one moonlight night ending in a clump of underbrush where he came so near to wild promises that afterward he cursed himself and talked plain to himself , " You 're a fool , your kisses are promises and her answering kisses are her promises , and you 're a weak muttonheaded fool if you do n't make a clean breakaway . " He woke out of a sleep saying , " It 's lovely but it is n't love and you 're a rat and a louse , you 're a rat and a louse , that 's what you are , rat , louse , rat , louse , and you know it . " Over Wilderness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow over the woods . And they slung their knapsacks and began marching on September 13 and footed it through Medford , through Malden , and camped at Beverly overnight and the next day marched into Newburyport where they slept in the Presbyterian meeting house Friday and Saturday nights . Sunday in that same meeting house they heard the Reverend Mr. Parsons preach a sermon , then they marched to the wharvesp539where thirteen companies of eleven hundred men in all boarded a fleet of seventeen ships , sailed down the river out to sea and steered east . One morning and another and they steered into the Kennebec River , sailed to the waiting boats at Gardiner , heavy boats made of green wood and leaky , often called " batteaux " from the French coloniststo the north . Into the boats they loaded barrels of pork , flour , sugar , salt . They took turns at the oars and up the river rowed the heavy boats five miles to Fort Western , on to Fort Halifax at a river mouth the Indians called Sebasticook . They unloaded the boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar , salt , some eighty rods past the falls . They came back , roped the boats , pulled them up from the river and carried them , two men to a boat , to be loaded again with the barrels of pork , flour , sugar , salt . They rowed upriver again . Sergeants Winshore and Elwood and their squads of men dropped out of the boats and waded waist-deep and higher tussling to lift the boats over rocks . Night came and they slung together shelters of brush and built roaring fires and stood drying their clothes while eating their pancakes and pork before going to sleep in their still wet clothes and waking to shiver in the early frosts of the northern colony of Maine . The next day came colder and the river more rough and twisting . They could see the boat leaks getting worse and the water seeping in to reach flour and sugar . Night came . It turned colder . Their clothes froze on them . They were picked and hard men . They could still laugh . While it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pork and flour up a steep ledge . After that they dragged their boats past the boiling and foaming Skowhegan Falls . Seven miles of smoother going the next day took them to NorridgewockFalls . Here sleds and oxen waited . They loaded barrels and boats on the sleds and prodded the oxen a mile and a quarter through woods , opening a few soaked barrels of flour to find it spoiled . Thirteen miles to the Devil 's Falls , a sixteen-foot leap of the river , they came to the next day , unloaded the boats , lugged barrels , dragged the boats , reloaded . Seven miles upriver the next day again they packed their boats and barrels on ox sleds , slogged through the woods in a cold four miles passing the last human settlement . From there on no roads , paths , trails , no mark or sign of men , women , people . From there on wilderness and only one white man , a British officer , had ever made the trip . Here they shot a moose . Here they broiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they capered less than they joked . Were they not going to Canada ? Were they not a secret expeditionaimed to surprise Quebec and drive out the British and make friendsp540with the French and seal all of North America to the North Pole in a common fate with the Thirteen United Colonies ? Were they not chosen woodsmen , hunters , and sharpshooters , including even a battalion from Virginia that General Washington viewed with special pride ? The next day some of the oxen and sleds had given out . At the next unloading the men opened pork barrels , shouldered poles slung with pork slabs , staggered in underbrush , moss , over fallen trees . Hard going yet trout thick in the streams here made them a fried-trout supper . The seventh carrying place they came to the next day , over a bog . They sank in slippery mud and mire . Sergeant Winshore kept standing , to rest and get his wind , more than once mired to his knees with a pole of pork slabs on his shoulder . The days passed , getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes slower to dry . The days passed and it was a month since they slung their knapsacks just outside Boston and started for nobody knew where . They were moving up Dead River now and could sec a mountain far off snow-white . The fifth week , flour running low and one day no flour and the pork ration small . They began to know hunger and the pull in the guts when weak from hunger and marching with a heavy pack . One night that week came all-night rain , endless water pouring from the sky . The river filled and flooded over its low banks and ground into their blankets . They stood up in water halfway to their knees , all around them water and in the dark they could n't tell where was the river and where away from it . In water up to their knees near daylightthey groped guided by shouts and yells to where men had found ground free from swirling raging waters . The sixth week and they came to the eleventh carrying place early in the morning , wrangled past that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the twelfth carrying place , then a halfmileto the thirteenth carrying place . Then in falling snow to meet ice and driftwood as they tugged against a flood-swollen stream , the men underweight from hunger and worn with lack of sleep , they saw six of their hard-worn boats go to pieces on rocks , saw the last of their salt wash away . Wet to the skin , their shoes , stockings , breeches , full of holes from wear and tear , their feet and legs black-and-blue , their ankle joints swollen , Sergeants Winshore and Elwood went to sleep that night by a roaring fire and woke in the morning damp , sore , stiff in every muscle , their hones aching , each with his personal and particular misery , the same grinding exquisite pain for Robert when he tried to move his right knee joint , for Elwood when he tried to move his left shoulder joint . " A week ago , Oat , and we had the last flitch of pork , was it ? "  |p541  " Yes , Bobby , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last ox to roast and put it into our bellies as though between here and Quebec we 'll meet more oxen every mile . " They snuggled in their clothes and blankets , careful to hoard what was inside . Not warmth was it inside but a few layers of protection against worse chill from the cold air they could see as a smoke when they blew their breath into it . They had a question and answer for morning , noon and night . They comforted each other awake or worn and half-awake : " How in the hell did we get here ? " " On our legs . " " And how 'll we get back ? " " On our legs . " Now Robert asked , " Oat , can you see that mountain far off snowwhite ? I can just see it without turnin my head . " " I twist my neck a little , Bobby , and out the corner of my eyes I see it . Kind uh purty and kind uh terrible , ai n't it , Bobby ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're terrible , Oat . " " Might be . " " I 'm thinkin , Oat . " " Do n't think too hard , Bobby , no place to be thinkin . " " Then you do n't want my thinkin ? " " Tell me your thinkin , Bobby , leastways make it easy if you can , no dark thinkin . " It was a half-dreamtalk that eased them . The others sleeping or dozing round the fire could take it for the wind in the trees mingled with firelog sputter and crackle . " I had my mind on why we came , why we stuck , why a thousand other men came and why they stuck . " " They ai n't all stuck . There 's plenty want to go back . " " I know  --  and there 's a plenty ready to go on to starve and die in the snow before they 'll give up . " " You can have it  --  but why ? " " That 's what I been thinkin on . " With his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert would say " thinking " but with Elwood and the rank and file he talked like them and said " thinkin . " " And the thinkin goes like this . There are men so made they see a thing to go through with and they go through with it . They ca n't see the end . The end is too far off to see . And they go on and on as far as they can toward that end of a thing they got to go through with and no other way to it than go far as they can . " " Might he . " Elwood meant he should go on . " They wonder what 's over there that ai n't there . They wonder what it 's like . They start toward it and keep goin . And what keeps ' em goin is the wonder . When the wonder wears too thin they hesitate.  |p542When  the wonder dies down and they lose it then they ca n't keep goin . That 's when they stop . Sometimes they keep that wonder alive by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not braggin , but goin on because already they 've gone farther than they ever believed they could go . " " That sizes up this expedition , Bobby . I never expected to be part of uh expedition nor yet more any expedition like this . " " And my thinkin ran on , Oat , to where I had the united American colonies , the Continental Congress and the Continental Army ahcl the American people , all off on uh expedition . They ca n't see the , end of it . The end is far off , further off than the white snow on that mountain they say is forty fifty miles away and they do n't know how far exactly . And those holdin the wonder in ' em , those who 'll never let the wonder die down in ' em , they 're the ones that 'll keep on . They are men and women so made they see a thing to go through with and so long as their legs and their will lasts , and the wonder stays with ' em , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could be sure exactly what 's at the end , like as not they would n't want to go on . " " Never heard you like this of a mornin , Bobby . " " Been thinkin . This expedition the American people is on , it aims a country across the Continent . So they name the Congress Continentaland the Army Continental . Ten million people after a while , then twenty million , a big new country , one of the biggest in the world . We 're makin one America . The children will make another . Their children and the children 's children will make other Americas . Change , all the time change . Under all the sufferin , shame and struggle , enough hope and wonder to keep it goin , from one America to another . The people uh one time will look back and wonder how the people in uh time earlier stuck it out and stayed through and went on . " " banged if I see how you do it , Bobby . You 're too danged cheerful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , afraid to come fully awake and slide out of his clothes and blanket , he mumbled on , near a caressing tone . " And you 're a danged fool this mornin , Oat , or you 'd know danged well I been talkin about you in what I been thinkin . You would n't uh come on this danged expedition if you 'd uh knowed what you had to go through . And you would n't uh believed you had it in you to stand up against what you been through at the thirteen carryin places and what lay between ' em on the Kennebec River and the Dead River till you come where you see a mountain far off snowwhiteand nobody knows its name and I hear it might be us the first to give it a name . There she stands with a shine and a glitter and we 've come to the Unknown Mountain and that 's all we know . " " I tell you again , Bobby , you 're too flighty and cheerful this mornin and I 'll live to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as other days just passed these two chumsp543stuck it out and in grinding pain kept on with their units . They were slowing down , others saw , falling behind , and yet keeping on and arriving after dark to join their command . Aches all over their bodies most of the men had but Robert did his slogging with that neverendinggrind of pain in a knee joint and Oat with the same endless misery in an arm joint . It was the next morning Oat heard Robert , " Why did we ever start on this God-forsaken expedition ? What goddamnedfools ever took it into their heads any man could make this march and at the end of it stand on their legs and fight ? We 're gone , Oat . I 'm gone , you 're gone , we 're just a lot of lost sonsabitches , the whole lot of us , the sick and the well , the rank and file and the officers . " Oat spoke softly . " Bobby , you 're out uh your head . You 're tired and sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A lot uh poor sick starvin sonsabitches lost in the wilderness  --  that 's us . " " Shut your mouth , Bobby , you 're wastin what strength you got left . I 'm tellin you now you got more strength than you think for . " This was the morning they tried to stand up . Oat stood a minute or two longer than Bobby . And what both of them did was to wobble and sink to the ground and lie there . They were sick and dazed though not so far gone their eyes and instincts did n't tell they were under suspicion from the other men looking them over as though they were as good as any of the others only they were soft and afraid and what they lacked to go on was guts for one thing and will for another . Worse than their weakness and pain for both of them was this suspicion from the others . They had belonged to a fellowship of hard unbreakable men . Now they were being thrown out of that fellowship . They did n't belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lay in to the next carrying place where again they were dragged rather than carried to their boat . They were alive and dimly conscious enough to see others like themselves burdening the command . They numbered forty the late October morning when they were loaded into boats , the forty sick men who could n't stand , put in charge of three hundredwho could stand but who said it was death to go on and they were backtracking to where they came from . Oates Elwood saw Robert try to push them away when they came to drag him to the homebound boats , heard Robert , " I can go on . All I crave you to do is let me go on with you . I 'm not quittin . " " Me the same , " cried Sergeant Elwood . " I 'm not quittin . " A colonel stepped in with an order . " Stand ' em on their legs , we 'll sec . Up on their feet they were stood like two long wavering sacks . Their eyes , their grim mouths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could do . A few flickering seconds they stood . Theyp544had pride about it . Thcy would call up hidden strengths and move on with the main command . They were not turning back . Then the fibers by which men stand slackened , their frames sagged . Elwood pitched forward on his face . Winshore drooped and fell to the ground with his knees near his chin , his eyes closed , his lips trembling . Their boat on a downslide of foaming wild water crashed on a rock . They were spilled into whirling waters . They could thank the two men who took the risk of bringing them through raging shoulderhighwater to the riverbank . They could not later reproach those two men for going on with the main party . Two days they lay in bright warm sunlight and rested . Two nights of the first real sleep they had in many days . The aching weariness of their bodies let clown a little and their ankles throbbed less and the swelling went down so they could notice it . Elwood could move his right shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's left knee made him howl if he tried to stand and move on that left leg . They lay on dry grass in the morning sun and turned their bodies and caught the smell of their clothes drying and made sure the powder for the gun left to them got good and dry . Was it two days or four they stayed there , heaping leaves and dry grass over them at night , and spreading the last of their wet flour on a heated flat rock and making fire-cakes that stayed their hunger ? Was it two days or four that Elwood dragged Winshore along on a crude combination of a sledge and a litter ? They could remember it was Robert 's eyes that caught sight of a deer and it was Robert who lay waiting alone and wondering for four hours while Elwood stalked the deer and wounded it and chased it and reloaded and killed it . He dragged cuts of the animal to where he and Robert with their knives trimmed it and cut hunks of it to roast and to eat as the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though salt was lacking and neither dared mention salt to the other when they so keenly missed it . On the third day Elwood brought branches and withes and they made an improved sledge-litter for Robert . On the fourth day they started in a light drizzle of rain , with cold roast deer meat they believed would last them ten days . It did last them the ten days and they went on another day and another with nothing to eat except redhaw berries and hazelnuts . Elwood followed a small creek that ran into the Kennebec and found a still pool that looked good to him . He dragged Robert to i t and they camped there three days using bent pins for hooks and several kinds of twine and string from their pockets and knapsack for line , catching carp , bass and pickerel , traveling on with smoked fish that lasted them five days . Then it was hard faring again , few fists or none in the pools they tried . Was it two miles a day or ten they were traveling ? They couldn'tp545tell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raining they built a lean-to and spent the time near a fire though there were the two clays that set them back when Elwood could n't scare up any dry wood . Was it late November or early December by now ? They could n't know . The rain turned into sleet and then snow one day . Then had come a two-inch snowfall . Their clothes hung in rags , the bare skin showing in many places . Their rheumatic pains shook them and by word and by silent looks and gestures they told each other they would go on till death took one and then the other would lie down alongsideand join him in the long sleep . They could never be clear afterward about how those last staggering five days brought them to a hut where they lay fevered and spent on pine boughs with dry ground under them , a fireplace with a clay chimney near by , roast deer meat and corncakes brought to them by a hunter and trapper who never smiled , talked little , and seemed to be saying , " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm curious whether you will and you 're welcome to what I 've got if you can show me you 'll come through . " That was Elwood 's guess as to what the man 's eyes and other signs said . Robert 's guess was that the man had had some great trouble in his life and the man believed his trouble would sit easier on him if he could bring life to two men nearly dead . With shelter and warmth , with rest and food that were rich comfortsafter what they had been through , the days came when though weak they could stand and walk without pain . They reached Newburyportand the home of a Minute Man still limping from a wound he took at Bunker Hill where he had fought alongside Winshore and Elwood and seen them among the last to retreat . The feather bed with white sheets , they stood before it and laughed . They crept into it . They found their bones resented it . They slept on the rag carpet on the floor . They tasted milk , wheat bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They felt a shame creep over them when the news came back of half the expedition to Quebec arriving alive and able to stand , living skeletons making a brave fight and losing , high officers killed and wounded , the entire body made prisoner . They talked about this shame that crept over and through them . They fought against it but it came back . Their Bunker Hill comrade told them , " You were sick men that could n't stand , you were half-dead when you turned back , now you 're a couple of crybabiesabout it . " And this shame , this sense of guilt in not being there at Quebec among the living skeletons that fought to the last , this bored in on them and was harder to get over than the rheumatic pains that still kept at them in occasional twinges and flashes . They had fairly gotten over it when at the end of January they again slept inp546the dormer and had been put on light duty at General Washington 's headquarters . " He 's put us straight , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little talk with General , Washington . Their record at Bunker Hill , in hand-to-hand fighting that covered the flight of those who had run out of powder and had no bayonets to meet enemy bayonets , Elwood taking two minor flesh wounds in the course of killing three of the enemy , Robert stunned and senseless for five hours from a cannon ball that scraped his breast and carried away one coat button  --  Washington had that record clear in his head and spoke of it . He seemed to read their faces and flickers of the shame and guilt that had been an awful load to them . Now the load went away for all time . The Commander said that with men like them the common cause could n't lose . He spoke of each man learning to face his own conscience . They knew he was misread , his motives attacked , lies gabbed about him  --  and he was n't letting it bear down on him and weaken him . The Commander used the word " calumny , " a cold fearsome word meaning malicious gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be laid on him for the failure of the Quebec expedition would be worse than any put on the two sergeants for not reaching Quebec to be in the fighting there . They saw his load so far heavier than theirs that they went away lighthearted . They felt important and ready for anything . " Yes , he 's put us straight , " echoed Robert . They had taken to themselves part of the calm and patience that was Washington . " You know , " said Robert , " he makes me think of that snow-white mountain we never reached . " " That mornin I said you was too flighty and cheerful . " " That mornin . " " And the next mornin you took it all back and damned whoever it was got up the expedition . " " Out of my head , crazy with the rheumatism . " " I know . We did fair and well , Bobby , never on the long way back , not one goddam . " " We was too near either heaven or hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Elwood said , " I told her , Bobby . " " She can see how it is ? " " Yes . It hurts . But Ann sees . She covers the hurt . And I would n't be sure . With a woman you ca n't tell . She cried at first . Then she talked about how there 's nobody like you and she wants you so . " " What could you say there ? " " I told her things you do n't know about yourself . " " How would you mean that , Oat ? " " How I heard you out of your head with fever and pain and you would babble over and over , where are you ? ' and words I couldn'tp547make out but that name Mim runnin through them and one time , Mim , come close , I need you , Christ , I need you . ' " " Jesus , I did n't know I did that . " " And that blue silk kerchief , I told her about that , how every stitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tear in it , how you would touch and handle it , how one time I saw you kiss it and I would n't be sure you had n't been cryin . " " And you told her that . " " Then came the worst . She said you never told her about this other girl , this Mim . " " It would be too crazy to tell , Oat , too crazy I say . This Mim , this other girl told me to go to hell , never to show my face around her again , goin to forget every last letter of my name , and I was low as the lowest . " " Shc gave you the blue kerchief ? " " Yes and I should keep it to forget her by . Is that somethin to talk about ? " " I think I see , Bobby . " " It 's as crazy as the Kennebec River rheumatism . " " That 's crazy enough . " Oat crushed tobacco between his fingers and filled a long clay pipe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oat . " " T would uh been handy on the Kennebec . " " T would uh killed the rheumatism and us with it . " " Ann is one of the loveliest women there ever was , Bobby . " " She is and I know it . That 's part of the tangle and the hurt . " " I mean inside lovely , too . At first she blamed you . She said you led her on . She cried about that . Then she got straightened out uh that and I 'll be damned if she was n't sayin she led you on as much as you did her and maybe more . " " I know what you mean , inside lovely , Oat . She is . " " She said you had suffered enough if anybody wanted revenge on you . And she said she 's so glad the two of us are alive and you have saved her brother 's life as much as he saved yours and the rest of it she 'll try to forget and she 'll know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her any more because you hold a fear some wrong or harm might come of it . " A silence came over the two of them . Oat smoked and saying no word now and then passed the pipe to Bobby for a suck . Soon they put out the candle lighting their dormer room and went to sleep on a Turkish rug knowing their bones would be restless in the feather bedp548Every Girl I Had in New York Turned OutFlightyHORSES and oxen , sleds and men , between mountains and along valleys , up to the hilltops then down the grades , forty-two sleds and eighty oxen , hauling , all winter long hauling , stopped by rain when the oxen could n't drag the sleds over the wet ground . Yet over bare frozen ground they hauled , over thin layers of snow and through drifts piled to the oxen bellies , on trails through forests where they had to chop a pathway , across creeks and rivers where the ice had to be thick enough to hold the heavy loads they were hauling . From far up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seized Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point , they had hauled their heavy loads , with eighty oxen to feed and squads of men and their horses . Far down at Boston Washington waited for what they were hauling . If they came through , Washington could pound Boston to pieces and drive the enemy into the sea . The Continental Congress at Philadelphiahad studied whether Washington should have permission to pound Boston to pieces and after debate had decided , Yes they would let him wreck and smash Boston if he could , even John Hancock standing up and saying Washington could knock down the walls and roof of his mansion and they would n't hear a whimper from Hancock . Guns lay on those forty-two sleds , thirteen brass and twenty-six iron cannon , eight brass and six iron mortars , two iron howitzers , twentythreehundred pounds of powder , and a barrel of flints  --  fifty-five big guns in all . They made a long silent clumsy parade winding their way through the wilderness . Washington prayed and hoped they would come through . If they did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God only knew how long the siege of Boston might run . Weeks had passed and the news came back to him of difficulties , obstacles , weather conditions , hindering and hampering . At the head of this procession of slow oxen and heavy guns  --  or at the tail end of it , if needed  --  rode a heavy man . He weighed nearly three hundred pounds . After the battle of Bunker Hill he was named a colonel . Before that he was a Boston bookseller , a militia grenadier , studying artillery , trajectories and range finding . This was the Colonel Henry Knox who came to Washington with the idea of this winterp549haul . Over frozen rivers and lakes you could bring sleds where wagons could n't make it winter or summer . Washington hesitated till he talked it over with Knox . He liked Knox . Ile told Knox to go to it . They were taking chances , both knew well enough . " Hazardous , " they called it . Down to Albany and across the Hudson River and on into the Berkshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as twice before there came the young express rider from General Washington to see and talk with Knox , to look at the sleds , guns and oxen , to ride away again and this time to report to Washington the chances looked fair , the worst hazards over . And when late in January the word flew around in the army at Boston that the big guns were coming and it was a sight to see , every man not on strict duty went to see them pull in , lining the road by thousands and cheering to see enough big guns to blow Boston off the map . That was the day Sergeant Robert Winshore saw Colonel Henry Knox walk into Washington 's headquarters with General Nathanael Greene and alongside General Greene a young fellow Robert had to look at twice to make sure who he was . Robert did n't know then that the young fellow was an aide on the staff of General Greene and had been " lent " by Greene to Washington for the rides to New York and up into Vermont to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a long slow second look did figure out who the young fellow was . He had changed , this young fellow , and now stood hard and brawny , walked with an easy swing , tan and windburnon his face . " By the Everlasting , " muttered Robert with glee . He had slept in the same bed with this young fellow , he had kicked him around and slapped his face in play . " It 's Locke , the little devil , " said Robert . Later Locke had him meetingColonel Knox and General Greene . They were brothers , had n't met in a year , and could they visit an hour ? General Greene told Locke , Yes but no more than an hour , there was work to do . And they visited , telling what had come in letters from their father , Robert giving Locke assurance that their new stepmother was a rare woman and he had n't a worry about that . " You look peak-eel , " Locke said with an anxious closer glance at Robert , who told of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing one button , and then of the Kennebec River , briefly sketching it , and ending , " I would n't like to think back and tell all of it . I was that dazed and half-awake through it I guess I do n't know the half of what happened . " I 'm proud of you , Locke , " Robert went on . " You 're good for sore eyes to look at . You do n't know how sweet you are for my eyes to see . A little more weight and your face wider and you 'd be the image of papa . "  |p550This  hit Locke deep , went to his bones , for his father was to him the man of men . Leaving the Tozzer printery Locke had gone to Jamaica Plain and enlisted with the Rhode Island volunteers under General Greene and had gone up from private to corporal to sergeant and for " valor " at Bunker Hill up to second lieutenant . When Robert shyly mentioned the " Leesa " he had met with Locke in New York , Locke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust her like I do the horse General Greene gives me for important messages that must be delivered . Leesa 's father turned Tory arid she turned with him and tried to take me with her and I came near calling her a dirty baggage . " " Locke , I 've heard good men say a good horse is more dependable than the best woman . " " I do n't go so far as that . What I 'd say now is I know plenty of horses I 'd trust farther than I would Leesa . Her father went Tory for comfort and to please some bigwigs he hopes will make him a bigwig some day . And Leesa went right along with all his reasons , no mind of her own , looking for a man can give her comforts and finery . That 's enough of Leesa . What of that girl you came to New York with ? You went around New York so much with her you could n't give me the time I wanted . " Robert 's answer came slow . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went with another girl , and a fine girl , but I could n't forget that first one . She told me never to come back , said she 'd forget every letter of my name . But I ca n't tell why . I 'm not sure I know why . I 'm not sure she knows why she sent me away like she did . It may be I 'll forget her and take up with another . And then , Locke , there 's this war to fight . What is love when a war is on ? It can be anything . I 've met men glad the war came because they could break away from their wives . It 's tangled , Locke . " " You was in a state about that girl , I calkerlate , " said Locke in mimicryof the New England dialect they had picked up . " A woman 'll go with you if she 's sot her mind o n't , " mimicked Robertin return . P551 " I hai n't met such a woman yet , leastways that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might alter your mind about it and if you should think to come away with me , let it be soon , " said Robert , quoting from Jabez Hunker 's farewell to Mim . " A woman a bit flighty in the upper story can get a man most beat out till , la fer me , he 's in the twitters , " laughed Locke . " He 'd better 've gotten him an uncommon woman with takin ways , " said Robert . " Nonetheless she might threaten to wring his nose , " said Locke , addingthat it was n't particularly Yankee . Robert had heard a Virginian on the Kennebec , one of the Morganoutfit that had marched in three weeks the six hundred miles from where they started in Virginia to Cambridge , Massachusetts , " We care no more for our lives than three straws , " and newly arrived troops not yet sheltered telling visitors , " We sleep on the soft side of the hard ground without straw . " Both had heard of the father and son at Bunker Mill moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the father feeling the sting and scrape of a bullet in the calf of his leg , crying , " They 're shootin bullets , son , and we got to shoot bullets back at ' em . " They were taking a slow walk around and among seven houses circlingheadquarters where seven well-to-do Tory families had for many years enjoyed fellowship as good neighbors . Now those houses swarmed with American officers and troops . The seven Tory families , after the bloodspill of Lexington and Concord , had moved into Boston to live that winter in want and cold they had never known before . Locke had heard from a man out of Boston about a woman with chilblains " not only in her feet , her hands had chilblains too . " Houses and good furniturehad gone for firewood , Locke had heard , and hundreds of good trees . " Our grand old Liberty Tree was cut down to the roots , " added Robert . " The only satisfaction we have was that one lobster-back climbed the tree to show ' em he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do but get too far out on a limb and crash down to a fall that killed him . " " You might near call that an act of God , " said Locke . Robert looked tenderly at Locke saying this . He could see his brother having found something that , if not a religion , lay in him as a genuine reverence , something they had always felt deep in their father . Robert had felt it moving and growing in him . He made a prayer it would grow in him as he saw it had in Locke . Had Locke laughed about the enemy soldierfalling to death from the Liberty Tree Robert would have joined in the laugh . As it was , he said softly and gravely , " You 're right , Locke , it was an act of God . " P552Locke had heard two officers from Boston talking of a third officer , one saying , " They report his finances war n't rather low than otherways , " and the other , " He sustains the fairest character . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Robert would say , " He sustains the fairest character , " and Locke would say it of Nathanael Greene . Among many of the generals and colonels there was jealousy , spite , bickering , low gossip and intrigue , " like cats and dogs , " Washington had said . Robert could tell of Washington 's momentswhen he was vexed enough to say of the New Englanders that their officers and troops did n't deserve their reputations , " they are exceedingdirty and nasty people , " and of their greed for money and profit , " the Massachusetts people suffer nothing to go by them that they can lay their hands on . " To this Locke had an answer fresh from General Greene who saw Washington as not having " had time to make himself thoroughly acquainted with the genius of this people . " You could n't expect veterans in a raw militia of a few months ' service nor Yankee traders naturally commercial to drop their lifetime habits to be good soldiers right off . " His Excellency , " Greene had written of Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Superior Race of Mortals , and finding them of the same temper and disposition , passion and Prejudices , Virtuesand Vices of the Common People of other Governments they sink in his Esteem . " The young brothers saw Washington and Greene as two great generalshelping each other with fine understanding though they came out of different conditions of life . Washington was a Virginia aristocrat , a country gentleman , planter , sportsman , one-time card-player and gambler , a proven Indian fighter . Greene was a Yankee of Quaker training , his ancestors following Roger Williams to Rhode Island for religious freedom , the fourth son in a family of eight boys and one girl . Greene had swung a hammer in his father 's forge at Coventry , Rhode Island , read the books of Locke , Watts , Swift and other authors under the guidance of the Reverend Ezra Stiles who had become president of Yale College . Why should n't his sentences be correct since he had wormed his way through the famous grammar of Lindley Murray and talked personally with Murray ? Greene it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide elm tree and speak the welcome of New England . Greene it was who brought to the Continental Army the only regiments in uniform , with tents , camp kitchens , better than usual order and discipline . Greene had a slight limp , a stiff knee from boyhood . " On a horse you ca n't see the limp and when he is afoot he 's where needed , " said Locke . " You might not believe two years ago when his home neighborhood organized a militia company they would n't elect him a lieutenant and they hesitated at letting him join as a private . After doubting he would make a soldier , because of that slight limp , they at last did let him in . He drove to Boston and passed out of the town through the guards in a wagon loaded with straw that covered a complete military outfit for himself and a deserter from a British regiment who served them in Rhode Island as a drillmaster . The Quakers read him out of their church . And he says now with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's his religion and he believes the hush of silence is good for a man and he can be the most wonderfulsay-nothing I ever saw . He 's against war but he ca n't be against this war . " If all the officers could understand each other and put away personaljealousy and know when to say nothing like Washington and Greene , the war would move faster , " said Robert . They were finishing their talk in a corner of the headquarters frontP553room when Oates Elwood came in and joined them briefly , his face rippled with pleasure at meeting Robert 's younger brother and finding him such a fine specimen . " A little heavier and the face widened a little and he 'd be wonderfullylike his father , " said Robert . Elwood before leaving spoke of his sister . She was lately mending officers ' shirts and uniforms besides working on bandages and other hospital needs . Two officers had brought her a ham and he was joiningher this evening in a ham supper . " Your brother might like to go along with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locke . " Why me and not him ? " asked Locke with a nod toward Robert . " I 'm on special duty , " said Robert . " Ought to be a pleasant supper , " said Elwood to Locke . " With you there will be four of us . A woman working with Ann , just come last week , will be with us eating the ham . She 's been with some relatives on a farm and she 's a first-class sewing woman . Used to be in one of the stylish dress shops in Boston . " Robert held back , with an effort , his question , " Who is she ? " Robert was restless that evening . He rode past a mile of campfires and made inquiries for a headquarters officer on matters where Washingtonwanted assurance that all was going well with the newly arrived artillery . He was very much awake in their dormer room when Elwood came in at nine o'clock saying the evening was perfect and he did n't expect such another in a long time . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turned out to be Mrs. Evelyn Trutt . And she had looked so kindly , so gracious , so sweet and understanding to Elwood that on leaving he dared to put his two hands to her arms just above the elbows and smack her a kiss on the cheek . " I did n't think I 'd dare do it to a decent woman , " said Elwood with a half-bashful grin . " I knew her at that dress shop where she worked , " said Robert . " A quiet woman and something lovely about the way her gray eyes would take in what was going on and she would n't say a word when all the other women were gabbing . " " Quiet and lovely , that 's her , " said Elwood . " Older than me , I suppose , but I like her and I 'll be thinkin about her . " And Mrs. Trutt had spoken of the Cavendish dress shop being completelyempty of customers for many days after the fighting at Lexingtonand Concord . And in tears and bitterness a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtains , locked the door , and told the girls the place was closed . " And the Wilming girl , that Marintha Wilming you met with me at the White Cockade coffeehouse nearly a year ago , did she mention her ? " P554 " The last heard of her the enemy sent her through the lines to get to her home folks out Lexington way . " And that was all , the first scrap of news Robert had of Mini near ten months . The days pressed fast with heavy duties for all . They worked on gettingthe big guns to where they could sweep Boston . Then if the enemy did n't leave Boston they would open fire . Yet an hour or two could be snatched now and then for the lively quartet that met at the house where Ann Elwood and Evelyn Trutt lived and worked . Locke and Ann , Elwood and Evelyn Trutt , those were the couples . With each of them a serious affair was developing . " Every girl I had in New York turned out flighty , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flighty kind . I feel I can depend on her like no other girl I ever met . " Locke knew by Robert 's face that Robert was pleased and could n't quite find the words for what pleased him so . " She is open , Robert , " added Locke . " She would n't hide what she thinks I ought to know . " And it came out Locke had learned that neither his brother nor Ann 's brother thought fit to tell him about Ann 's going with Robert nor about Ann 's fraudulent marriage with a British sergeant who had slept with her in her own home and later taken a fearful beating from Oates Elwood . But Ann had told it all to Locke . Not at first but later when she said that sometime he would find out all about it and it was better she should tell him everything before others who might tell it wrong . She had had enough sorrows . And if Locke was going to be another sorrow in her life it would not be through suddenly finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . " And I 'll be clanged if I do n't love her more than ever since she told everything like it happened , " said Locke . " I asked Oat about it and he says she 's a brave woman with a big heart or she 'd be suspicious of all men forever from now on . But she ai n't suspicious of me . I look at her and I say she 's made for love , the kind of love I can give her . " " Have you told her that ? " " I do n't have to tell her . She 's the first girl I 've had where I feel it 's there between us and it 's going to last and we just ought to be near each other and not talk too much about it . " P555A City TakenSIR WILLIAM IIOWE , chief in command of the British troops at Boston , was a brave man in battle . He had shown that at Bunker Hill in 1775 and at Wolfe 's Cove and the Plains of Abraham fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to like the Americans in that war against France for Canada and after this younger brother was killed in action at Ticonderoga there were Americanswho loved and revered him enough to put up statues of him . And when General Sir William Howe came to Boston at forty-six years of age and replaced General Gage he was under the difficulty that the Americans loved his brother and hated him . IIe was under still more difficulties . He did n't agree with King George III and the King 's ministers on how they were managing America ; they did n't need to bear down so hard . They named him to go to America and bring the Rebels into submission because on his brilliant record as an officer and strategist he looked good and could do the job , so they believed . Now these months General Howe had stayed in Boston having at times more guns , powder and troops than Washington . He could have run ships up the Charles River and split Washington 's army . His ships could have pounded American fortifications to pieces to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the Americans out of powder . Howe tried none of these . At times he did n't seem interested in what he had come for . An Englishman loyal to Great Britain was to write of Sir William Howe that he " liked his glass , his lass , and his game of cards . " He had time , with other officers , for pleasant parties , drink and cards  --  and time too for a woman who came to be known as an attachment , if not a belonging , of his . She gambled like no other fine lady in Boston , had a name for more than once having lost at a sitting three hundred of the gold coins known as guineas . Her husband had been mayor of Hingham , Massachusetts , had been high sheriff of the royal province of Massachusetts , had been among the foremost of Loyalists . General Howe was to name this man Commissary of Prisonersand the man 's wife was to win a name , even among Loyalists , as " a Delilah , " an " Illustrious courtesan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl from Dorchester , whose play and byplay with General Howe figured in why he was slow and why one English letterwritershould say , " . . . the harlot 's eyes glistened with wanton pleas-P556ure at the general 's table when the brightness of his sword should have reflected terror . on the face of the rebels . " The rousing good song " Kiss the Cold Winter Away " could have been sung that winter of 1775-76 in Boston when hundreds of houses of absent rebels were torn down for firewood and the well-to-do Whig John Andrews , having sent his delicate wife to Marblehead and safety while he stayed to watch the six houses he owned , could write to a churn , " if you 'll believe me , Bill , I was necessitated to burn horse dung , " underlining two words . In a bright moon the March night came when hay stood piled one side of the steep road up to Dorchester Heights , enough hay to screen from enemy view the three hundred carts , ox teams and horses , thousandsof men with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felloesso to make no noise , not a word above a whisper spoken to ox , horse or man , while all night long men toiled at making the fortificationsfrom which , with those cannon and mortars hauled on ox sleds from Ticonderoga and Crown Point , they could bombard Boston and the enemy ships and troops . General Howe 's first thought was to attack , as at Bunker Hill , to march his men up those steep hills and take those freshly fortified positions . His second thought was more slow and sober ; the cost would figure high . It would be the bloodiest battle fought on American soil and he was n't sure he could win it . Boats to carry more than two thousand troops had been made ready . The boats would take them near the fortified heights where American cannon commanded the harbor . Wave after wave of troops would be hurled up . More reinforcements would be brought over in boats and hurled up the heights . The war of the American rebellion would be over . Boston lost , the war was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies . So General Howe planned and hoped . Then a storm wind began blowing and with it a lashing rain . On Dorchester Neck and up and around the Heights rode Sergeants Winshoreand Elwood . The moment came when soaked to the skin they could ride back and report at headquarters that it was clear the enemy had given up and American officers were sure the boat crossing could n't be made and the attack was called off . Then came what was ever after called the Evacuation of Boston by the British , Sir William IIowe moving out of Boston Harbor with every last man and gun he had  --  and along with them more than a thousand Loyalists who could n't think of staying in Boston . When Robert , the next morning after a night in cold rain , tried to get up and stand he did it on one leg . The rheumatism had come back . The pain of it was grinding him as he rode into Boston on March 17 with the Continental Army . But what he saw and heard that day took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never had Boston Harbor been so thick with sails , so white withP557sail canvas . They were a city by themselves , those ships with nearly eight thousand British troops and eleven hundred Loyalists bound for Halifax . " Some good men on those ships , " said Robert to Elwood . " Doctors , merchants , a ship designer , two carpenters I knew well , and they went along on their work and never made any trouble as informers or in any other way , peaceable men who just naturally love the King of England and ca n't see a war against the King . But the most of them on those ships , let ' em go , good riddance , we can be glad they 're gone . " Robert waved his hand toward the ships on the horizon . " You 're out there , Hobart Reggs , I suppose , and your evil daughter Sapphira and I hope you never come back . " Another sweeping gesture of farewell , and , " You 're out there too , Silas Ludgate , you tattler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He had heard of the miseries of the Loyalists but his heart was hardenedtoward them and he luxuriated in an evil glee over what he heard . So little room was to be allowed them on the ships that they had to pick and choose among their belongings , many a one leaving behind for the detested Rebels a cherished coat or gown , a chair or clock , books and paintings . To the ships they hauled by cart or personally lugged their hurriedly chosen goods of life , necessaries , keepsakes , treasures . Some brought cats , clogs , birds and bird cages , furniture , bedding , violins , harpsichords . From many of these came wailing , howling , cursing , when it was found more space for more refugees had to be made on the overcrowded ships and no time lost about it . Overboard went cats , clogs , furniture , a spinet around which a respectable family had often gathered , and bird cages from which fluttering canaries , macaws , cockatoos and parakeets had been released . And as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had seen it told of the man who could n't part with his dog and leaped off the ship and went to sea bottom with his beloved pet . While Oates Elwood rode to find his home torn down for firewood and no news of his father and mother , Robert rode toward Aunt Ellen 's . house , saw it standing , tied his horse in front , and went toward what seemed the front door standing open . Reaching it he found the front door gone . Every other door of the house he found gone . Every piece and stick of furniture in the house was gone . At the rear and sides hoards had been ripped away . The rag rugs were gone from every room , the stubby Arabian brass candlesticks , the Franklin stove , the andirons , pokers , shovels of the kitchen fireplace , no article of fond memory left . The ax and saw he knew could not be in the woodshed as he looked out the back door and saw the woodshed vanished , every chip and splinter of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in back-yard dry grass . He must leave this place in a rush . The hurt of looking at it stabbedP558dark and soft in him . Before leaving he leaned at a wall in the front room corner and sent his hands groping toward where the oak settee had stood , where he and Mim had touched with their feet and heads both heaven and hell . He leaned there half-spent and the tears near came and he shook in a series of dry sobs and thin moans . " We been pitched on for to go to New York , " said Elwood to Robert early in April . " Must need us , " smiled Robert . On a three-day ride to New York they met here and there among others the same comfort , the same fear , they themselves held this month of April , 1776 . The comfort was definite . They had driven the enemy out of Boston after eight months of siege . They had beaten the enemy at Bunker Hill till they ran out of powder . They had killed two for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlestown a year ago when the war began . This was a string of victories . They could look at it with pride ; a few more victories would see independence won for the American colonies . This hope and comforthad spread wide over all the colonies , with more unity , more confidence , from Maine down to Georgia . Their fear too was definite . More than half of General Washington 's army had melted away . Men had gone back to their farms and towns , gone for many reasons . They were needed at home , they said . Or they had had enough of fighting , enough for a while anyhow . Some were tired of discipline , camp-life monotony , irregular and bad food , and the conditions that at one time had more than two thousand soldiers around Boston on the sick list . For some of them Washington could n't hold back his disgust and contempt . He spoke and wrote of these as " chimney-corner heroes , " even mentioning one prominent officer who resigned as dreading to leave " the smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enough of that slack and careless spirit could lose the war . Sergeants Winshore and Elwood had threshed over the comfort and the fear that in a way canceled each other . " What we got out of this war so far , Bobby , shall I tell you ? " " What 's on your mind ? " " What we got so far out of the war is hard work and the rheumatismand neither of us expects to get any more from now on except more hard work and more rheumatism . " " That 's right , Oat . You had time for a little love with Evelyn Trutt and now you kissed her good-by and you know well your luck will be good if you ever see her again . " " And you , Bobby , you do n't tell me and I ai n't askin but I think I can see it that you had some kind of a love and you lost it and if we win the war you do n't know whether you got a love to go to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if I talk about it I think about it and I got no call to think about it , for when I think about it it makes me go soft and you ca n't be soft in a war . " Betrayals and Wavering FaithMICHAEL McGILLICUDDY 'S sister Maureen entered the Blue Anchor tavern and many eyes turned on her . Some spoke greetings , the keeper said , " Good to see yez , Maureen . " She was short , stout and hard-muscled like her brother . When she spoke or smiled her wide mouth brought into view one black tooth and the gaps of two missing teeth . A scattering of large rusty freckles on her face made the creamy skin look more fair . Her blue eyes , she had been told , had the lakes of Killarney in them . The man who had told her this , her Dan Shannon , came in carrying his blacksnake horsewhip , a worn-looking and tall bone-rack of a man , his clothes wet from driving a cart in the afternoon drizzle of rain , and soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going home for a change of clothes . The Blue Anchor was about halfway between where Maureen worked and stayed as a house servant and the little upstairs room where Dan slept . His seven-year indenture to a brewery owner would run out in the fall and hers to a merchant next January when Dan and Maureen planned to be married . Michael McGillicuddy came in , joined them in ale , fish , vegetables . And before Dan was to go home and change out of his wet clothes Michael , who himself had been loading kegs and barrels into carts duringthe day and his clothes not dry , thought they should have a good glass of hot rum . They were tilting their glasses and having slow sips of the hot rum when a tipsy fellow stopped at their table and scraped his shoes on the sanded floor and leered at Maureen and called her his macushla . He was not Irish , they noticed , or he would n't be sayingit as " meecooshaler . " Dan told him to go away . Michael told him he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still he stayed leeringand calling Maureen his " meecooshaler . " With a silly face he reached toward Maureen and patted her face with one hand . Then Dan Shannon stood up and gave him a shove under the chin that sent him sprawling on the floor . Now another man had left the bar and came heaving at Dan Shan-P560non , who did n't see him . He swung a blow that sent Shannon cold to the floor . Michael stood up , saw Shannon on the floor , senseless , not a move in his body . Michael picked up Shannon 's whip , felt the stock of it heavy-leaded , swung a fearful blow at the man who stood over Dan Shannon and seemed pleased over his smooth fast knockout of Shannon . The blow Michael swung cracked the man 's skull . The doctor who came a half-hour later called it a fracture . When the man died the next day his friends saw to it that the police made a search for Michael McGillicuddy . Jean Shepherd hid Michael for three days in the cellar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was after that third day when the police had come and questioned Jean and the Winshoresabout Michael , that Jean told the Winshores where she was keeping Michael . It was two clays later that men recruiting for the Continental Army arranged for Michael to wait at the house of a farmer , a patriot , a few miles out of Philadelphia , and there join , as he did , an outfit of raw recruits marching overland to join the forces of General Washington up at Long Island , New York . " T is well Michael has gone to the army , " said jean Shepherd to the Winshores . " He was born to fightin . It was only me cryin to him not to go held him away . Had he let the man have it with his bare fist in place of a whipstock heavy with lead , he would n't have killed the man and why he did as he did he swore to me he could never tell from searchin his heart . He killed a man not mcanin to and now he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duty to kill and the more he kills the better a soldier he is . " Then came her confession that she and Michael were indentured servants at York Town , Pennsylvania . Each had three years yet to serve . And they had run away , hoping to marry the next year and move to a distance where they could not be taken by the law . " Then came his wish to go to the army and fight , " sobbed Jean . " Only the warm love between us kept him from goin . And now he 's got the first wish he had and I am a woman more lonely than any iii all Philadelphia . He may go to hunger and death and he may go to strange women . " The Winshores had her bring a pitcher of cider to the front room . They sat her between them and comforted her and partly persuaded her that Michael had gone to a great army fighting in a holy cause of human freedom , that if he died from fighting or camp fever it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth . Winshore pointed to William Bradford . " He owns the printery where I work . He owns the bookstore next to the printery and the coffeeshop next to that . He is no young and brawny man like your Michael . He is fifty-four years old . And where do you find him now ? He 's with that same army of Washington your Michael has gone to . P561He 's an officer , a major , heading a battalion of Pennsylvania militia he helped organize . They need him . He knows they need him . His wife , sons and daughters here in Philadelphia , knowing him to be a man who will be in the front of the fighting like your own Michael , they too have heavy hearts . " Winshore pointed to Robert Morris , supposed to be the richest man in Philadelphia . " He was no Rebel till the news came of the bloodshed at Lexington and Concord . Then he said it must be war . Now he is risking his fortune in this cause your Michael fights for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powder . He could have comfort and ease by not taking a hand in the war and he says he must refuse that kind of comfort and ease . " Jean 's eyes lighted at Winshore saying , " I have two boys I love as my own flesh and blood . They are with that army . They may sleep on the cold ground with your Michael next winter . " The wide curves of Winshore 's mouth trembled and his voice was a half-whisper . " I should n't have been talkin so , " said Jean . " It was my first cryin over Michael goin . I 'll cry again but I 'll cry soft so you wo n't hear me and I 'll try not make it a selfish cryin . " Jean went to her room saying she was sure she would sleep better than the nights just passed . Winshore spoke to Mary of the force that Michael marched with . He had seen in their Philadelphia recruiting office the hunter and frontiersmanHiram Kester , the tall spare man he had once seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Wilderness . A fifteen-year-old boy and " the old ooman , " said Kester , would take care of the five smaller ones while he would try his firclock at any sharpshootingWashington wanted done . From an Elizabethtown man who came to the printery one day Winshore had learned that Jack Mallon  --  the hairy giant he had seen clash with the two British officers in Mr. Graham 's tavern  --  had gone to the army . " Some hard men , wild brute fighters in that army , what with Mallonand Kester and Michael McGillicuddy , " he said to his wife . " And your own boys , they have become hard , " said Mary . " Yes , to endure in war they must grow hard . " " And what these hard men fight for is a dream and a hope . " " Yes , Mary , a thing as airy and insubstantial as the mist and color weave of the rainbow . They fight for a future and what they believe they can make of that future . Beyond that they know nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to take the chance that it wo n't . " His right hand rested softly and lifted and shifted on her hair and head , at the sides and over the forehead , as he said , " Yes , Mary , theyP562want a future where they can take the risk of making a nation that will be a light to the world . " " A terrible risk , is n't it ? " " So terrible it fascinates men with its possibilities . If they win they know the like of such an adventure has seldom if ever been seen in the world . " He rode a horse and turned into the roadway leading to the shed where the Winshores used to keep a horse . A knock came loud on the back door and they heard Jean Shepherd 's voice , " Why , it 's Mr. Robert ! " In his uniform of buff and blue , throwing his cocked hat to a corner , his arms went around his father who held him tight and said no word . A pale face , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his eyes seemed to have drawn farther back into the sockets , his clothes hanging loose for he had lost thirty of his hundred and eighty pounds of weight . The lines crinkled here and there on his face told the father his boy was ten years older than when he had last seen him scarcely more than a year ago . Headquarters had sent him on several rides to forges and shops making muskets and powder . They wanted immediate reports on what they could expect and when , no time to be lost . Their campaign plans depended on what powder , guns , flints , they might be sure of at certain dates in the future . On the last ride he had pushed on through driving rains that soaked him , had forded two swollen streams , and had ridden two days in the grinding pain of his rheumatism come back worse than ever . Headquarters saw him a sick man , a case for the hospital . There he rested and improved enough to make the ride from New York to Philadelphia , to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tumult and confusion of his service at the headquarters , shapingcrude militia into an army while they held the enemy in Boston , seldom had Robert known anything like rest and nourishing food at proper hours . Now beginning this mid-May of 1776 he had it . I-Ic rested , loafed , luxuriated in a clean bed with white sheets that sometimesmocked at him with their accusations of what he had that other good men he knew did n't have . Now Jean Shepherd set before him the fat of the land and as the weeks passed of evenings and Sundays he had the healing companionship of his father and a stepmother he called blessings on . She did housework of mornings and went to the printery and filled in on many kinds of jobs during the afternoons . She saw Robert rounding into better physical condition , his weight on the increase , his cheeks filling out , care lines of his face filling and smoothing a little . But his talk did n't come back to its old light andP563warmth . His eyes did n't change . Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would brighten , then lapse into silences Mary could n't fathom . Once he quoted a Boston Tory he had heard saying of the Loyalist magistrates of Massachusetts , " They have n't the spirit of a louse , " and added freely with a bitter twist of a smile , " I am like that now . I have n't the spirit of a louse . " With a few days of rest the rheumatic pains had gone . And he had groped for a new strength and in part that had come . But he spoke of his weakness and his lack of worth and the failure of his body to returnsoon enough to the old fiber and fire he had in the days when he was on an instant 's notice ready for anything . Worst of all signs they saw in him was a recurring mood when his faith in the Revolution sagged and sank low . In one of these moods in mid-June and clays lazy and pleasant to his body , he said , " I 'm going back and I 'll fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I 'm not sure what the war will bring even if we win it . I used to believe . Now I do n't believe . I 've seen in our own ranks too much greed , jealousy , fear , hate , petty bickering and low spite . " He looked at his startled father on the evening he said this . He saw in his father 's eyes and face only silence and anguish . He could read that his father pitied him as a sick weakling and for the moment an irresponsible . Ile saw an easing of stress move on his father 's face when after a long pause Robert said , " My body is coming back but something inside me that was there does n't come back . Till it does come back you must forgive me for what may seem to you a slack faith . It has run darker and more slack in me than I have told you . It may be nothing will bring back my full faith but the army , where I can every clay see men under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Betrayals ? " asked the father . " Is n't there betrayal somewhere in this country when brave men must fight without powder , without the small pay promised them , without the food and equipment they deserve ? We won at Boston becausethe enemy did n't know how low we were in powder . He could have routed us any day he had chosen to attack and go on with the attack till our short powder supply was gone . Washington was betrayedby those who did n't care , those who could have seen to the powder supply and did n't . " A long pause and the father asking , " Do you think , son , that perhaps it can be worth our time to try to stand up under these wrongs and betrayals so long as the head of the army does n't go down under their almost crushing weight ? " Another long pause and the son saying , as something like muted go ! row crossed his face , " You understand it , father . You too have vaned and tossed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others fastened to him in a loyalty beyond death  --  it is they will bring the war and the Revolution through . It is they haunt me and rebuke me and pull me back toward the Continental Army . " They said little more that evening and spoke good night aware there had been a cleansing of hearts and a glimmer across the bitter darkness in the house . A little action , some degree of responsibility without heavy work , was what Robert needed now , the father saw . And as Bradford was a printer for the Continental Congress , an arrangement was made that Robert should attend afternoon sessions and serve when needed as a clerk or messenger for committees and members of the Congress . Often the tonic of new hope ran through Robert watching those fifty-six men of the Congress in Carpenter 's Hall , twenty-five lawyers , eight merchants , six physicians , five farmers . And again he felt slack over slow and self-important delegates , fidgeting , nibbling and quibbling . Toward the end of June on warm afternoons flies came swarmingin from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their best at being deliberate and dignified while fly-bitten or brushing away flies . Robert knew the presiding officer John Hancock welcomed news that the enemy had used his house in Boston and left it in fairly good conditionand yet Hancock still let it rankle in his heart that he had not been chosen Commander-in-Chief of the army . Sam Adams , John Adams , Robert recognized in their seats  --  and Elbridge Gerry who had lain chilled to the bone in a cornfield at Menotomy wearing only a nightshirt , Gerry with his long pointed nose and wide-open frank eyes . Three Philadelphia men he knew , the eminent young physician BenjaminRush , Robert Morris the financier , Ben Franklin the world-famed scientist who until the last week in June was kept to his home with an attack of the gout while recovering from boils and dropsy that set in on his long journey up to Montreal . There Franklin , a freethinker , and Charles Carroll , a Maryland Catholic , simply got nowhere at persuadingthe French Canadians to come join in a war against Great Britain . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even Sam Adams and those of little or no property wore finer clothes than at home , some of them like Sam in suits and silk stockings presentedby the home folks who believed it would add dignity to the Congress as well as to the colony their delegate represented . Many wore wigs though Benjamin Franklin got along with a black skullcap to cover his bald dome . Several had their silver snuffboxes and exchanged snuff and sneezes in courtesy and fellowship . The soft melodious drawl of delegates from the Southern colonies stood sharp alongside the New England keen nasal twang . From the Middle colonies were spokesmen of neither drawl nor twang . Many Southern and MiddleP565colony delegates had their suspicions of New England . More especially Southerners slanted their eyes in doubt of New England motives . This was partly suspicion of " the shrewd Yankee trader , " partly that New England was and had been fiercely Puritan . Robert did n't know it nor did the Southern gentlemen who were suspicious of New England know it and John Adams , the Massachusetts delegate , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote to his wife April rq , 1776 : " The gentry of Virginia are very rich , and the common people very poor . This inequality of property gives an aristocratical turn to all their proceedings , and occasions a strong aversion in their patricians to Common Sense the Thomas Paine pamphlet . But the spirit of these Barons is coming clown and must submit . " Yet this same John Adams had nominated George Washington , of the Virginia gentry , to be Commander-in-Chief . And this same John Adams was saying in June of ' 76 to the delegates one and all that when the Continental Congress should be ready to pass a Declaration of Independence , the one man to write that declaration was Thomas Jefferson of the Virginia gentry . There were good men and great men from all sections , not sure of each other , thought Robert . They had n't worked together long enough to know what they could and might do together . Sometimes a desperationcame over him when he heard a cheap and garrulous speech from a self-important delegate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For they were debating in this June of ' 76 in Carpenter 's Flail the phrases and ideas for a document to tell the world that the thirteencolonies were formally entering the nations of the world under the name of the United States of America . Every delegate had personal viewpoints . Every sectional group of delegates had political secrets they could n't bring into the open , for doing so would threaten the unity of the colonies . This impression Robert discussed with his father who said , " We can be thankful for what unity there is . The common cause has thus far overridden the meaner motives of the smaller men . " When Washington walked into the hall there was applause and all eyes studied him . Was he not their shield and spearhead ? What authoritycould the Continental Congress have without the Continental Army to back it up ? The Commander had been asking for more to fight with than they gave him . He would go on asking for more guns , powder , supplies and equipment than they would give him . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith . The delegates spoke , nibbled and quibbled , and brushed away the very-stable flies biting through black silk stockings . They spoke , gal and transacted momentous business of world-wide interest thisP566June and early July of 1776 , reaching a long arm of hope far into a hazardous future . Two men rode up to the Winshore house one evening , tied their horses , went into the house and made it ring with glad babbling and high laughter . John Locke Winshore and Oates Elwood were these two , with messagesfrom General Nathanael Greene for General Washington . They expected to ride back to New York in a day or two . General Greene had told Locke the messages were important and he should pick a rider to accompany him in case anything happened to either one of them . Locke had filled out , grown harder and more sunbrowned , outweighingRobert now , and his deep-set brown eyes a little moist at seeing Robert and knowing why Robert looked ten years older than his age . The tears rolled down Ordway Winshore 's face as he held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever like himself . " Good Lord , I 've never seen you so happy , " said Mary . There were moments that night in the Winshore house when the four men and one woman held their peace and said not a word . There was so much to say they were aware they could n't get it said . They felt so utterly solemn over the issues and events of the hour that they were shy about laughing ; they were so glad to be alive and whole for such a coming together that they sat quiet with faces shining at each other . There did come the little stroll of Robert and Elwood up the street a few blocks while they talked about their rheumatism , how Robert 's seemed to have gone away for the time being , how Oat had been on his back four days with one attack and a week with another . Ann Elwood and Evelyn Trutt had taken smallpox inoculations in Boston and were coming down to New York to join the Medical Corps . " We hope to see our girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oat . And very tenderly Oat asked , " No word from Miss Wilming ? " and heard Robert 's brief " No , " and that was all of that . The father that evening saw a touch of color come to Robert 's cheeks , his eyes for the first time losing the furtive gleam that he seemed to hold deep back in the sockets . The Congress and its talk had been tonic for him but it was the Continental Army and its action that woke the heart 's blood of Robert , so the father thought . The two comrades , Locke and Oat , their faces and voices reached deep into Robert . As Locke got going , to his father and Mary he was swift and vivid with more than enthusiasm . Adoration it was the father saw moving this son , two adorations that gave him strength , glow and zest for life , Ann Elwood for one , Nathanael Greene for the other . " I liked her face the time I saw her at the White Cockade and IP567can see yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her hair thick around her white face , " said Mary . " She knows just when to be cool and when to be warm , " said Locke . Later Locke talked of General Greene 's information that the enemy would land in heavy force under warship guns at some point around New York . And the General had his doubts about letting the enemy choose the New York neighborhood for a campaign . The General seemed to favor burning New York City , blotting it off the earth , and forcing the enemy to come to ground more favorable for the ContinentalArmy . Of two things Locke was certain , first that General Greene would join in no mutterings or complaints about the Commander-in-Chiefand would give all he had in loyal support of any plan of campaign that Washington decided on , and second that the year would see terrific fighting and put the Continental Army to harder tests . Mary had asked Jean Shepherd to bring a bottle of sherry and glasses . Mary poured a glass for Jean . They joined in Mary 's good-night toast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brave and health and good luck go with him . " And Jean gave an answering toast : " Good luck before ye , bad luck behind ye , and the grace of God to guide and guard ye . " It was later , before going to their night 's sleep , later after quiet . talk and the shadowed glow of being together , that the father called on Robert to speak a toast to end the rare evening . They held their glasses long and saw Robert 's face white , drawn , strange yet calm . And the waiting troubled no one . Then with a finality each one understood came his words : " To the common cause  --  so dear to us it is , dearer than life itself . " The father and Mary went upstairs saying good night . Robert before going up spoke to Locke and Oat about their sleep on the front-room carpet being a soldier 's luxury . As he turned to go upstairs Locke 's two hands took Robert 's right hand and pressed it tightly as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Robert . " The Moon Sees DeathTHE moonlight made an oblong on the rag rug of the upstairs room . Then with the moving of the moon , far , high and lonely on the sky , the oblong slowly slanted into another shape with sharper triangles atP568the end . And these triangles shifted smoothly and relentlessly into a thin straight inch-line on the rag rug . The man and woman in the bed saw nothing of this moonlit oblong and its pale mark that soon fluttered faintly and went away leaving no print of what it had been . The man and woman in the bed slept on as they had many another night when the moon had put those same inevitable changing patterns on the same rag rug . They had picked several pails of blackberries that day . The man had taken a look at his hayfield and sharpened two scythes to be ready for hay-cutting if the fair and warm weather kept up . The man stirring in his sleep , suddenly sat up . The woman too sat straight . " Thee heard ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots ? " " Four , five , mayhap six . " Jacob Drayton was out of bed and into his clothes . He stood at the front door . Off toward the north he heard galloping horse hoofs , heard them slowly fade . His wife was at his elbow . The two young girls and their sixteen-year-old brother came . They listened . The horseman who came into view rode at a slow walk . They went out toward him . He turned his horse toward their gate , stopped and waited . Jacob Drayton had run out to the gate . In front of the rider , slung over the saddle and the horse 's shoulders , he saw what seemed the body of a young man . They let the rider in . They helped carry the body into the front room of the house . Mrs. Drayton sent the girls up for quilts they spread on the floor . They laid the young man 's body on a pile of quilts , saw the breath was gone from him , some tension of struggle still marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , another bullet hole lower down . The family cast glances occasionally on the face of the dead youth . The straight massive figure of him they could see had been lithe and swift , while the strange rider gave his name and that of the other one , and how where the road went through the woods a half-mile away two enemy horsemen had wheeled and pointing pistols cried they must hand over their pistols and consider themselves prisoners of the King . In an instant all had emptied their pistols . One of the enemy fell to the ground , his horse running away . " He , too , " pointing toward the white face , " fell off his horse that took fright and ran . Thankful I am the nearest house was not Tory . " " Neither are we Whig . We have no part of this war , either side , no hand in the killing of man by man . " And yet could not they do the errand of mercy to take the body of this youth to his father in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of mercy in the name of the Lord , " said Mrs. Drayton . So the rider soon went on . He had to be going . The orders were that if one of them was stopped the other must go on . The message they carried might mean life or death for some good men that General Washington valued . Toward the north and New York went the horseman . Toward the south and Philadelphia went a farm wagon , Jacob Drayton driving , at his side his son Enoch . They halted for a look in the underbrush at the face of a trooper in a scarlet coat , with gilt buttons , a white belt and a brass buckle glittering . The moon came out from a fluff of cloud and suddenly lighted the profiled face . " Not a bad man , " said Jacob Drayton , " not a bad face . A mother , a sister , will weep for his not coming home . He could not know what he was doing , to go out and seek to kill other men a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body for decency 's sake , moved the head so the face turned toward the sky , stood in a silent prayer . They drove on . Neither the father nor Enoch spoke as the wagon lumbered on . The hush of silence , it was their doctrine and practice , could bring the benefit of calm amid turmoil . They found the street and the house . They knocked . They saw the father in the doorway holding a candle that lighted his face . The father helped them carry the quilt-wrapped body into a front room to a couch . They were asked to come again sometime to this house where they would always be counted good neighbors . They drove away . The father sat with his hand in a woman 's hand for an hour , two hours , at the couch and the face with the tight-closed lids . He studiedthe mouth whose tongue had made clear he was prepared for this ; if the lips could now speak they would be saying there must be no regrets . To his other son sleep was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning before he should know what had happened . In the morning would be the time to say , " Robert , Locke came home last night . " He sent the woman to bed and sleep . " You must have your rest . " He sat alone another hour . Then he went to his sleep as though he kid done some of his mourning before the sudden bloodshed of the early night . Though he slept deep , twice he awoke and came again to the couch and the lovable bright brown head and the mouth not unlike his own . P570A Shroud , a Document , a MeetingA LIFE , even the longest , is a short one . The oldest man that ever lived died at last . Nothing more certain than death and nothing so uncertain as the time and the hour . These ancient proverbs Ordway Winshore murmured as he walked Philadelphia streets early this July morning on an errand that comes perhaps in each lifetime . He had walked along blocks where the stone houses stood three stories high with four tall windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining brass knocker , sixteen windows to the two lower floors and four large dormers on the third floor  --  and between the house front and the iron picket fence a garden space for roses , for beds of pansies , for winding paths lined with bushes and bordered with mulberry and magnolia . He had walked other blocks where the two-story houses had only a wall between them , stood flush with the sidewalk , and the neighbors always near if not dear to each other . He had walked alleys where through open doors he could see knee-high children taking care of babies that crawled the floor and the mother bent over a washtub and summer flies everywhere in and out of the house . Here along these alleys he expected , for he had been here before , the smell and sight of the chicken house or pigpen so often at the rear of the small lot  --  and here and there he stepped around a comfortable bleary-eyed hog wallowing in a mudhole . More than two thousand houses now in this year of 1776 standing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little over nine short decades , not a street nor an alley , not a house big or little . That was when William Penn and the Quakers came in 168z naming their first settlement with a Latin word meaning " The City of Brotherly Love " though now it was a city split with anger and hate between Tory and Whig , between those who called themselves Loyalists and Patriots . Yet this generation would pass and time would heal old wounds and bring new ones and the birth rate would go on and the babies and the newcomers keep coming and instead of Philadelphia having two thousand houses it would have ten thousand , twenty and forty thousand houses . " Perhaps so , " said Winshore to himself , " I wo n't see it . The dear boy Locke wo n't see it . But the children and the children 's children of these people in these houses this morning , they will see it . " P571The future had hold of him . In a grief that he was pressing down and would not let have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Philadelphia to come , the America to be . It soothed him to do this . The boy Locke in the past two or three years had always been reaching out into that future , talking about it and dreaming of it when he would not talk of it . " I suppose , " said Winshore , " we might write on Locke 's gravestone : He died for a future America in which he had complete faith . He was first of all a good soldier , trained under Nathanael Greene so that he would have gone to any death ordered by his general . Yet he could n't have been that kind of a soldier without the compulsions of his dream of an America to be a great nation lighting the world . " He passed on Sixth Street near Catherine the Four Alls tavern with a painting , on its big sign , of a palace . On the steps stood a king in his crown and robes , an army officer in uniform , a clergyman in gown and bands , a laborer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say for himself read : King  --  I govern all . General  --  I fight for all . Clergyman  --  I pray for all . Laborer  --  And I pay for all . At the store of Attmore &; Hellings , on the wharf a few doors below Chestnut Street , he stopped to read a sheet of paper on the door : it told him what loads wagons hauled to Philadelphia from many corners of America , what cargo ships carried from many seas to this American port . " Bar iron , American blister , spring and square steel , sheet and rod iron , bake plates , iron tea kettles , Dutch ovens , pots , kettles and skellets . " He read this and said , " We Americans are born ironmongers , " and read further , " Tea at the price limited by Congress . " Now you could drink tea and you were a good Patriot if you bought it or sold it " at the price limited by Congress . " Also Attmore &; Hellings were ready to sell you " loaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine , nutmegs , spermaceti and whale oil , mackerel , &e; &c; &c."; In a store on Water Street , the fifth door above Market , Isaac Hazelhurstwas offering " coffee of the best quality , Muscovado sugar in hogsheads , tierces and barrels , molasses , cinnamon , powder blue , and a few hogsheads of exceeding good Jamaica spirits five years old . " how many years back was it that Isaac Hazelhurst had come out to pat knee-high Locke on the head and ask him into the store for a helping of Muscoadosugar ? Another store near by always brought him the same thought : After the war and the Revolution there would be generations of Americans Wlio would have peace between wars and they would go far in their work on the earth , in the variety of fascinating forms they would coaxP572from the land . " I think I could have a life given over entirely to peas and beans when I read this announcement of Marson Paddock " : Early Golden Hotspur , early Charlton , Dwarf Marrow-fat , and Dwarf Sugar , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad ' White Pole , dwarf Yellow and dwarf Speckled beans , with a general assortment of Garden Seeds . Winshore had a hunger for land , curiosity over what he might do with trees and bushes , with Marson Paddock offering young " grafted and inoculated trees " such as " Cherries , Pears , Peaches , Plumbs , Apricots , Nectarines , Apples , Quinces , Lime Trees , English Elm Trees , &c.; Grape Vines of all Sorts , red and White Dutch Currant Bushes , EnglishGooseberry Bushes of all Sorts , Asparagus Plants of the large early Sorts , Box for Edging of ' Walks . " Winshore 's ignorance of plants and spices came over him . With more time and a little land , of which he had neither , he would open the door and talk with Marson Paddock about " all sorts of Plants in their Season , as Cabbage and Cauliflower , Savoy , Ccllery , Endive , Marjoram , Thyme , Savory , Baum , Rue , Sives , Sage , Mint , Sorrel , also Garlick and Horse Radish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very lowest Prices , by Wholesale or Retail , for Cash . " Here Locke and he had paused once and Locke had said that after a time it might be they would have the little farm they had talked of and then they would go into Mr. Paddock 's store and get one each of all the interesting seeds , plants , slips and shrubs announced by Mr. Paddock . On Second Street between Market and Arch streets he came to where Hyns Taylor " begs leave to inform his friends and the public in general , that he makes up all kinds of furniture in the newest fashing , viz. dome , teaster ; drapery , Venetian , Gothic , canopy , four-poster and couch beds , also field and camp beds , all sorts of mattresses door was the place he had his errand . " Cynthia George , Milaner and Mantua Maker , " read the first large-letter lines of her announcement , which continued , " makes up all sorts of milanery goods , viz. childbed linen , children 's robes , jams , frocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of needlework , in the very latest manner . " Cynthia George had just opened the store for the day 's trade , it seemed , and two women could be seen in the rear room making ready for their day 's needlework . A short stout blond woman in an orange bodice and a triangle with foam-white ruffs that gave a fleeting view of her well-rounded breasts . A plump face with a full underlip and they were very cool , calm , grayish-blue eyes that Winshore looked into . An independent woman with no excess of courtesy , not troubled about adP573dress and manners , saying , " Yes , sir , what might be your good wish this morning ? " " A peculiar errand I have with you . " " You are not a lawyer come to collect a bill , I hope . " A woman of humor , not afraid of lawyers though she knew persons who were  --  that was her little joke . " You could be taken for a lawyer , sir , " she added with so bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load of grief for ordinary gloom , his breakfast not sitting well perhaps . " There are many kinds of lawyers . I hope I look like one you could trust . " He wanted her trust . Whatever he had come in for she must give him trust . Now she knew that and her underlip was very grave , and her eyes flawless as they gazed into his deep-set eyes with shadowy quivers of brown moving in them . " You do have a peculiar errand , no common business you come on early this morning , " she said . " You are Miss George ? " " Yes . " " I am Mr. Winshore , Ordway Winshore of the Bradford printery . " He reached a hand toward her and they shook hands warmly . " William Bradford , as you may know , has left his shop , his bookstore , his coffeehouseand his insurance company , and is away with General Washington'sarmy . " " I had heard of that . " " The printery he has left in my charge , though of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printing . " He hesitated , not over what to say , but in a sudden remembrance of the figure of Locke lying silent and cold out at the house . " Yes ? " said Miss George softly . " It 's my boy I come about . He looks like me , same eyes and hair , same cut of face . His mother died when he was born and I brought loin up  --  the Negro woman Emmeline and I , we brought him up though perhaps some credit should go to a brother just a little older who is a fine specimen of a man now . " A little more than a year now since my boy Locke went into the tinny and General Nathanael Greene , you 've heard of him I suppose , took a liking to the boy , found he could trust him . They could put hm on a horse and send him with orders and messages and he would get through . He seemed to know when to be cautious and when to beckless . And it was only last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They both had copies of important papers they must et to General Washington 's headquarters . If one did n't get through He other would . Whatever happened one of them must get through . nd it was n't as far as eleven miles out of Philadelphia where the ad ran through heavy woods , two enemy horsemen tried to stop themP574and there was a fight and all four emptied out their pistols . One of the enemy rode away wounded , another lay dead , and Locke 's companionbrought his body slung over a horse to a Quaker farmer who hitched a cart and brought Locke 's body to our house only six or seven hours ago . " " God help us , " said Cynthia George in amazement and in affectionateresponse to this father who had drifted into her store with this wild tale early of a morning . " Now he 's out there in the front room of our house , a white sheet over all of him but the face and the embalmer is to come this morning and tomorrow we will have short services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? I would like to help , Mr. Winshore . I can assure you I would like to help . " " I 'm coming to that . He was a fine figure of a boy . And now we 're going to lay him in the cold ground after our last look at his face and his earthly frame of a body . " He had brushed his hands together as though to rid them of any dust and ran his fingers tenderly , over a bolt of white linen , a strong and thick fabric , immaculate and gleaming . " Yes ? and now ? " Miss George was the image of attention . " I 've been thinking it would be nice , no , it would be utterly appropriate , for you to make a shroud , a winding sheet of some material like this , and you would make it very plain and simple and you might put on it any slight touches that you would think right . I would leave it to you . Any ornament should be so slight it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that , Mr. Winshore ? " " From what I had heard of you I believed you could do it , now that I have met you and talked with you about it , I have no doubt you can do this service . " Winshore saw her eyes glistening . She brought a chair for him , savinghe had had a hard night , brought another chair for herself , seated herself , leaned far toward his face . " I will work on this today and my two good women will give it their time . One of them is far from coal mon with the needle . " Now Miss George gave him a close scrutinizing glance , and went on to say , " You should know a year ago or two years ago I would haws served you as one more ordinary patron of this store . I cared for neither side . I said to the Tory and the Whig , It 's as far from here to there as it is from there to here and I 'm not going to join in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Whig called me a king-kisser . Thcn my boy went in . He 's a short thickset staunch boy , nineteen years old . the same big dark eyes as his father who was killed at Ticonderoga in the French and Indian War . He enlisted in New York where I had my store then and I went out to the camp where he was drilling and training and he came in a few times to see me . Now no one could have argued me into joining the Rebels . But he burned withP575something inside him and it got into me and burns there now . I have letters from him . The last I saw him he was on a horse with a companythat rode into New York and wrecked the printery of Rivington 's Gazetteer . " " No ! Who would believe it ? " broke in Winshore . " My boy out in the house there now , my boy was in that affair . Your boy and mine rode together that day . " " And I have my boy yet , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Time passes . How tall was your boy ? " " About a half-inch taller than me and I am five feet eight inches . " She took a pencil and noted this . " And his weight ? " " Near to one hundred and sixty pounds . He actually gained weight in the army . He always worked indoors in a printery and the outdoor life of the army , he took to it . " " I 'll hope my boy does that . Now this very linen here that you touched and admired , we 'll make it out of this . You 'll be going to your home or your day 's work now . We 'll begin on this right off . I 'll try to come myself to the Bradford printery by six o'clock and show it to you and leave it to you to take home . " Winshore walked home to the house in a curious glow of dark solemnity mingled with an exaltation . Over coffee , bread and butter and a boiled egg , he told Mary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the embalmer had finished , they went with him and viewed Locke 's body , told the embalmer he had done well and saw him out the door . In two large chairs gazing at the body with a white bed sheet drawn to the chin , they sat keeping company with Locke 's head and face . " Mortal remains , " said Winshore . " He was mortal and had breath in him . Now the breath is gone and here arc the remains  --  a husk , a shell , an outer vestige , a garment of clay that will molder with worms citing their way through it till they come to the bones . They will leave the bones to time and when enough years go by time will have eaten the bones to a thin white ash , a very fine dust . " " A process of the elements , " chimed Mary in a soft contralto . " It will come to you and to me and to every one of the millions who now walk the earth . King George will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it will count no more than with Locke in his lain linen winding sheet . " " A husk , a shell , " said Winshore . " Speech gone , thought gone , and He dreams gone . Yet the dream Locke died for , the dream that Joseph ' arren died for , the dream that sent Robert to agony on the Kennebec  --  all of them held that dream to be deathless . There are men Tankful they can live in a time when great dreams take hold of men . " " Yes , God help us , " said Mary . " There are men who go stalkingp576through life to end in magnificent tombs without once being shaken by enduring flame , eight white horses in plumes and spangles hauling a cadaver in resplendent garb , a husk and a shell , as you say , never in all its days touched by a great human dream , a vision and a hope incalculably greater than any lone individual , any shovel of dust held and moved in the possession of the dream . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through their murmurings . Now he did say swiftly , " You people , you two , in your quiet conversation that I could hardly catch , you have spoken Locke 's funeral oration , so far as I am concerned . I hope you limit the preacher tomorrow to some favorite passages from the Bible and perhaps one or two paragraphs from Tom Paine . " They said nothing now , resting their eyes occasionally on Locke 's head with the thick brown hair neatly parted , a heavy straggle of it down his forehead as he usually had it , and the wide slash of his mouth composed and utterly grave as though " I have said it all and there will be no more from me . " Soon Ordway Winshore 's head sloped forward . His unrest had been quieted by the hush of peace on Locke 's face and mouth . In his final sleep he too would look so . Now he drowsed . Robert tiptoed to the front door and out , on his way to the town and an important session of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the father in his bent posture in the chair breathed heavily and sonorously in his sleep while his son lay with no stir in a stillness of lips that the mightiest hammers and the most colossal sledges of earth could n't break . The mahogany secretary at the printery where Winshore wrote letters and handled ledgers , bills , orders , complaints , stood battered , nicked , scratched and scrawled , and as sturdy as ten years ago when new . In one corner of the secretary stood a small square of thick paper and on it the first piece of printing wherein Locke six years ago set the type and ran it off a press and took pride in it . The text was from Ben Franklin and read : Printers indeed should be very careful how they omit a Figure or Letter ; For by such Means Sometimes a terrible Alteration is made in the Sense . I have heard , that once , in a new edition of the Common Prayer , the following Sentence , " We shall all be chang 'd in a Moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omission of a Single Letter , became , " We shall all be hang 'd in a Moment , &c,"; to the no small Surprise of the first Congregationit was read to . The father reached for this , read it , and recalled Locke 's joking that " the great Art and Mystery of Printing " was a great art true enough butP577no mystery to him for he would soon be able to stand at the type case with his eyes shut and pick out letters , capitals , numbers , italics , punctuationmarks , initials , flowers , plumes and headpieces . Double pica Roman , English Roman , French Canon Roman , the boy babbled his early pride in having learned these " founts " of type . Time had since shown , the father was thinking , that Locke was no natural-born printer but had caught a surface enthusiasm from his father 's deep devotion to the printing craft . Now today the father would stand at the type case in a leather apron and pick the letters and make the type arrangement for the document expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years it was only on special work that Winshore took a hand at the type case . He had in his day set up newspaper intelligence items , editorials , advertisements , and almanacs , hymnbooks , collections of sermons and political speeches , pamphlets , tracts , title pages , woodcuts with and without plumes . He felt interest , even challenge , about the work to come today . Late in the afternoon came Robert , somewhat breathless , for he had walked as fast as he dared . " It is to be read aloud to all the armed forces authorized by the Continental Congress , " said Robert in catches of breath , " on all our warships and privateers  --  and in all churches , mass meetings , and gatheringsof men who are for the Cause . " Mary had quit writing a letter at the mahogany secretary and come too hear Robert adding , " It is the first announcement to go from the Continental Congress to all the governments of all the other nations of the world . " " The long-waited Declaration ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title and heading he was to set : " In Congress , July 4 , 1776 . The Unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America . " Then he read on , the cadenced opening paragraph : When in the course of human eventsit becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bondswhich have connected them with another , and to assumeamong the powers of the earth , the separate and equal stationto which the Laws of Natureand of Nature 's Godentitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causeswhich impel them to the separation . P578He read on . It was meat and drink to him . It was a mystic music to him . It had the laughter of Locke when he said good-by yesterday afternoon and went away with his brown eyes bold and confident . The words ran : We hold these truthsto be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creatorwith inherent and unalienable rights , that among theseare Life , Liberty , and the pursuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instituted among Men , deriving their just powersfrom the consent of the governed . That whenever any Form of Governmentbecomes destructive of these ends , it is the right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institutenew Government , laying its foundation on such principles , and organising its powers in such formas to them shall seem most likely to effecttheir Safety and Happiness . He scanned it swiftly and picked out the austere and momentous pledge that closed the document : And for the support of this Declaration , we mutually pledge to each otherour Lives , our Fortunes , and our Sacred Honour . Winshore 's eyes had been screwed to this paper , this document . Now raising them he saw Robert 's face white , his body with a queer hang to it . " I would like to send you home and put you to bed , Robert . You are a trifle limp . Now you go straight back to that bookbinder'stable in the corner and stretch out there and get you a good rest right now . " Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknowing might have thought he had had one drink too many . " Come along now , Robert , it will be good for you , " said Mary , locking an arm in his and walking him to the corner , hanging hisP579coat on a wall peg , loosening his top shirt buttons , laying one blanket over the table and fixing a pillow of another blanket , making him stretch out with a sigh of relief , and easing his shoes off . She left him with his eyes closed and on her way to the mahogany secretary said to her husband , " He 's better right off . " Robert was near asleep when two flies began crawling over his face and one that had located his hand sunk a bite into him that brought him up sitting . Now he took a quiet laugh for himself . Did he know this breed of flies ? IIe did . IIe knew them well . On hot afternoons lately they had honored the delegates of the Continental Congress and now it was a distinction that they should pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner . He looked at one that came through the window and sat on his big toe to reconnoiter the field . " The same size , the same impudence , the same sharp bite you give the delegates , " he laughed . Here the flies were few , however , while over there at Carpenter'sHall , with a livery stable next door and horses and dung piles for feeding grounds , the flies bred and thrived and swarmed through the windows and bit through silk stockings and thin shirts . One Virginia delegate agreed with others that the momentous resolutionsthat week would have been delayed in passage but for the incessant operations of persistent and bloodthirsty insects keeping the delegates completely awake and ready to pass on long-unfinished busiuess . Robert got up and pulled down the window and stretched out again with a newspaper over his face and another over his hands , and soon fell into sleep . ' Through the front door of the shop had come a woman with a bundle under an arm . Her eyes ranged over the shop and she walked straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bundle for him to see it as it lay on her two flat hands . He did n't see her for the bundle . He could see they had cared , they had anxiety to make it look precious in a smooth thick pale-gray paper bound in blue-and-buff cords of silk . His eyes followed the bundle as she stepped to a near-by table and unwrapped it , and tenderly and with skilled hands that seemed to know every fold of it , smoothed out to full length the garment that would shroud Locke for his last earthly journey . Winshore 's eyes ran the length of the winding sheet . Then his kinds went smooth along it . He had never been a man for ceremonial and regalia , punctilio of form , and his assurance to himself now was that this final vesture for that boy was fitting . The fabric had luster without gloss . Shrewd eyes and hands had seen to its strength of fiber and delicacy of texture at a hand loom , then bleached and dressed it with a sagacity out of long experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect sheathing for a bare body to lie in final repose in a small oblong of cold earth . He saw a fine thin braid of blue-and-gold edging had been hemmed in so delicately that it took a second close study to notice it . While his eyes still roved over the winding sheet , Winshore said , " Cynthia George gave great care to this . " " She instructed me to make it sweet and reverent , those were her very words , sweet and reverent . " His hands again ran softly over it , the finger ends touching the blue-and-gold edging . " It was your handiwork ? " " My day 's work and you might say a holy day . I am instructed by Miss George to remind you that she has a boy of her own in the Continental Army and she wishes it understood that she can not think of accepting any remuneration for this piece of goods . Her exact words were , Tell Mr. Winshore that I am a Christian , a mother and a Patriot first of all before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night before , the sorrow and the inevitable duties , the further impact of exultation over the Declaration of Independencearriving to his hands , had brought Winshore to where he was moving bodily and mentally not in a daze or trance but in profoundpreoccupations . His mind and spirit had been sent groping and clutching amid all the abstractions his life had accumulated around the immense themes of death and love , immortality and faith , human freedom and dreams worth dying for . Now for the first time he turned for a full look into the face of the woman who had brought the shroud , whose fingers had caressed it with a gracious and breathing handiwork . Now as he looked into her face he saw it was one he had met before . It had changed since he met it , the oval of it slightly more narrow , the gaunt quality of it having more of the gaunt , and he thought he could remember a reckless flair of pride that now had become something else . HIe dug down into his index of faces and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am correct , am I not , and you are Miss Wilming , Marintha Wilming ? " " We saw tea burn , we saw tea hanged on the gallows . " " We did , more than a year ago , and now the war has surged up from where it lay waiting to break on us , and you have come four hundred miles from Boston down to Philadelphia . " " I went to New York , you remember , to help a woman open her new dress shop . That was Cynthia George . I worked with her in New York this spring and helped her move down here . " Mary had come over to listen to part of this , then to shake hands with Mim . And Mary was going to ask Mim where she had been and what doing . Then she read in Mim 's face and eyes a dark turmoil , that only by an effort was Mim holding herself together . Mary laidP581a hand on the quiet burial garment , " Did I hear you did the work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mini with a faint tremolo Winshore did n't hear but Mary did . That same tremolo was in the face and eyes though not so definitely . Mary took Mim to one side . Winshore stood over the shroud , giving it final glances and touches before going to the type case . " You can see he 's lost in his grief , " said Mary , " not broken , but bowed clown . He tells me he would rather have died himself than have this boy go . It may be you can come and see what an impressive splendid face he has even cold with the life gone . " " Yes , I must have one long look at that face , " said Mim in a faltering voice . " There is something of pitiless beauty , something stark and melting , " Mary went on , a little shaken herself yet finding relief in telling another woman an impression that haunted her , " about seeing the father 's face and head alongside that boy 's face and head . They looked alike in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father . " " My God ! It is Locke then who was killed ! " " You did n't know ? " " I had no chance to know . I heard nothing more than that it was his son . " And Mary 's keen ear got it that the tremolo was still there in Mim 's voice but now it was an excitement of the knowledge that Robert still lived . She saw Mim 's face and eyes shade into a strange glow . Mary read clear that whatever had happened between Mim and Robert in the past Robert now meant the world to her . Mary spoke softly . ' What she said made Mim close her eyes and slowly clench her hands while her even white teeth moved over lower lip and then upper lip , biting the pale lips scarlet . " Robert Winshore , " said Mary , " is in the back of the printery on a bookbinder 's worktable . He is sleeping or resting there . IIard-worn he is , you should know . He came here to his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he once was and he has been making a recovery but it has come slowly . " " I 'll go see him . I 'll go softly . I 'll not wake him , you may depend . " " You 'll take every care ? He needs rest , God he needs rest . You believe you 'll rest him ? " " If I ca n't , if I do n't , " and Mary thought it was an inexplicable and marvelous shadow of loveliness that crossed Mini 's face , " then tomorrow I 'll want to sew a shroud for myself of black linen with two black roses stitched at the breasts small and fine and I ca n't think of a nightshade black of cloth that would be too dark for such a shroud . " Mary believed her . Mary walked with Mim to where they sawP582Robert on his back , the window light dim in the corner , a newspaper over his hands , another newspaper having slid away from most of his face , and his eyes closed . Mary went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though to say , " My prayers go for the two of you . " Mim glided as a frame of shadow on feet of mist to where she stood in reach of the sleeper . She felt herself a sort of ghost and him another ghost , though she asked if a ghost could have a curiosity like hers near to a hunger , and if a ghost could have such thick dark hair as she saw flowing away from his forehead and then tousled as though her fingers had run through it . High hope she had now . Ile was alive . She mourned that death had come to Locke . She exulted , not sure why , over Robert among the living . his eyes were closed . IIe had n't heard her . IIe might be sleeping or dozing half-awake , his chin , that jutting and determined chin , shifting to point in a new direction . She stood with her right hand folded tight over the fingers of her left hand . She ran her eyes from his face to his feet where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three on the right . She wanted to reach and touch him . She held back . The first this was she had seen him in uniform . Her right foot touched his threecorneredhat that had fallen off the table . She glanced to the long coat of blue with buff trimmings that hung on a peg above the table . His wool shirt had the same worn look as the stockings , with holes , stains and splotches . Two small holes in a shirt sleeve had been burnt , perhaps from fire sparks while he slept . Her right hand pressed hard the left-hand fingers as it dawned on her more vividly that toil , exposure to raw weather , cares , duties and battle fatigue had worn his rugged body to frail edges . The pathos of that shirt , hanging so loose on him about his torso , smote her . The shrinking that torso had undergone , that body her arms had so many times encircled , she saw it and a guilt came over her . She put away the guilt with a single eyeblink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than when he had come home then at that time he must have been emaciated . Ile was stirring . He raised his right leg , laid the right ankle onto the left , gave a slow delicious sigh of ease . his eyelids parted and through the slit he looked at his feet , wagged the three bare toes back and forth as though they might be telling him , " We 're here and you 're here and it does seem as though if we call the roll we 're all here . " Now his eyes came full-open . The pivot of his head brought his eyes around to where they fell on Mim . His eyes dwelt on her face , peered straight into her eyes as his mouth screwed itself into a comic twist and the tip of his tongue came out and Mim half-expected lie was going to stick out his tongue at her . His face smoothed down and his eyes ranged the length of her from head to toes and then back to her face and eyes . P583He shook his head sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes over her , blinked and looked again . He then dropped his head to a complete resting position , gazed at the ceiling , closed his eyes fast and tight , held them so a few moments , then opened them wide and flashed them full on Mini , and seeing precisely what he had seen before , he spoke as casually as a man in a dream , " I 've seen the ghost of you so many times I 'll burn my boots if you 're not a ghost now . " Mim stood in her foot tracks . She could n't move . She could n't be sure what to do if she moved . She saw in his eyes an unfathomable final something that his father saw and feared . Her shoulders shook . When her eyes closed an instant and opened , two or three large tears slowly draggled down her cheeks . He raised his shoulders , drew himself to a sitting position , and with a curious soft mockery , " But the ghosts I saw never cried . They were too proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should come falling down . They would n't cry if all the stars in the night sky were crying . " He turned his head toward the ceiling , laughed a hollow ha-ha with a peculiarly merry chuckle in it , then turned to her with an appeal not loud but deep-toned , beseeching her with a grotesque mouth , " Jesus , good lady , have a little pity on me . I 've had my share of spells with hallucinations . That 's the name for ' em  --  hallucinations . You see ' em . You reach . They 're gone . And you 're a fool . I 've seen you before . I put my hand out for you . And what I got was nothing . a bubble , a bauble , a whiff and a whoof of phantasmagoria and you can look at it and say Good evening , my sweet phantasmagoria , how do you fare today and will you walk a piece with me ? ' and you get no answer and you come out of it with a splitting headache and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your blanket again praying in Sweet Jesus ' name for no more phantasmagoria . " His eyes left her . He meditated aloud . " Up on the Kennebec River sleeping in the snow near the Canadian line I had some of the dangdest meals of roast duck with plum pudding and grape-jelly tarts with strong hot coffee , food as fancy as ever a man threw into his belly , and when I came out of it and sat up shiverin in my wet clothes , it was just one more of those tricks , a cheat , a bubble , a bauble . " His head pivoted swiftly to see if she were still there , and , " Stop your danged cryin . Step over here and put your hand in my hand . I 'll be danged if I 'll reach for you . " Their hands met . Their mouths met . His feet swung to the floor and they stood locked and interlocked in moaning and quavers . Something struck the floor near them . They looked and saw Robert 's father and Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door key to Robert and Mim , who plainly would n't be leaving . Suddenly Robert had lifted Mim and seated her on the table with her feet dangling . Himself he seated on the table with his back top584the wall and his legs crossed under him tailorwise . Then she saw his face cold and he was asking , " How do we know ? Can it be we arc making a beginning that will have the same end as the last beginning ? - How do we know ? " A flash of pain crossed her face as he saw it in profile and as it lingered when her face turned toward him . She would have that flash , he thought , if her arm ever had his rheumatism . I-le was less cold saying , " I would n't bring you pain , Mim . You 're the last person in the world I would bring pain to . " " Not now , Robert , please do n't be ice now . Another time be ice if you must  --  not now . " " Who taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was you . " " I did n't know what I was doing that night . I was out of my head . I was daft . I was crazy with grief . I was tangled head and foot . " " So I said to myself over and over . You did n't mean it , I said . Up on the Kennebec River your ghost would keep coming to me and I would talk with your ghost about it . I was clown to skin and bone . There was one night they cooked a dog for supper . They boiled the guts of that dog and tried eating it and spit it out . That was about when I said I must forget you because I began saying to your ghost , ' You did mean it , Mim , and how could you , how could you mean it ? ' I had enough bitterness without remembering you told me you would forget my name and every letter of my name and I could do the same for you . " His hand went to a pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spread on the table the blue silk kerchief . Now the tears poured clown Mim 's face . He went on , " ' I give you this to forget me by . ' Those were your words . ' I give you this to forget me by . ' Remembering you began to hurt so much and was such a pain that I decided it was good advice you gave me and I should try to make myself forget you . I was forgetting warm clothes , pleasant firesides , because it hurt to think of them . I was blotting out memories of good food and clean beds because that hurt . And of all memories yours hurt the worst , yours gave the hardest pain . And it got after a while that I could forget you a whole day and sometimes two or three days not a thought of you . " Mim winced and thrust out her two hands to press his left hand and drop it . " I practiced at learning to forget you , " he went on . " With practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said you must have spoken wisdom and it was important to forget you , never to see you again , never to let there be a beginning again , for another beginning could have an end like the last beginning had . " He was tired . His head slumping sidewise said so , his head leaning at the brick wall , as words came from him in a dreaminess of song murmur : " Is love a necklace I can put on and take off ? Is love a shoeP585I can slip on or kick off , if I please , to the moon ? In five minutes by the clock , love can he a thrush pouring flights of song with scarlet numbers and dancing alphabets  --  and in that same five minutes before your eyes that triumphant wild thrush becomes a monkey scratching a louse at his ribs and a louse at his buttocks while he mocks at you with his jeering monkey-faces . " He could remember , after all that had passed , the lines she spoke to her dance named " Love Is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkey-faces , I saw many of them , I hope you saw a few . " He was n't looking at her and he went on as though she were not there and listening : " Love is a great gleaming eagle that will sweep you for a ride to the top of the sky and a spread of green valleys and winding rivers for your eyes  --  it happens , it is an event  --  and love is a buzzard you can mistake for an eagle to ride , a scavenger who drops you to your death and takes its time to feed on you and pick your bones white and polished  --  this too happens and this too is an event . " He had paused for exact remembering , had hesitated and fumbled a moment and then gone on , his memorizing of her lines perfect . " I could n't say them , " said Mini . " I 've lost them . I found them when I found you . I lost them when I lost you , when one of my dreams ran that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid it on a fire and watched it burn and then in the middle of a sheet of foolscap , having sharpened a quill to write very fine , you wrote : My once dearest Mim  --  Since it is thy spoken wish , Icross thee quite out of my book . Robert Winshore ' The dream ended there . I like to think if it had gone on you would have laid this second letter in the fire . " " I could have written it and I could have sent it from the Kennebec River when there was health and strength in forgetting you . I did anything that would help forget . I used to make a list in my mind of all your faults , the faults you yourself admit to and especially the faults mean gossips give you . That helped , like it helped to repeat an old saying in one of my father 's books : Whosoever bath her hath a wet eel by the tail . " " That was unclean , Robert . " " And unjust . But it helped me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening between them ? Mim was asking herself . The answers , for the immediate moment , came to her . " Forgive me , Robert , forgive me not for all time nor forever . Onlya few days now forgive me . And listen to me for one or two minutes . " " Tell it . I have talked too much . I could better have slept thantalk like I have . Or I could have listened while you told me where inP586hell you have been since I saw you last . " He laughed . It came rather thin and hollow , not full-blooded . " I was getting to exactly that . We have been prattling here . Since we saw each other you have been to hell and so have I and we have n't begun to tell it . You have done hard duty and met heavy grief today and you arc worn . I did n't know you were in Philadelphia . I came here with Cynthia George when she moved her shop from New York . I intended to seek out your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cynthia to let me deliver the shroud I worked on all day so I might learn which son of your father had gone to the Great Valley . " And Robert saw a gray-blue seadrench in her eyes , ominous resolves beyond his reading now . She slid off the table . She pulled out his feet and straightened him and made a pillow and told him she would bring a chair and sit quietly by him for ten minutes or longer , when she would see him home . " You must do this . Tomorrow , later , we can talk . Another time we can report to each other what we saw , you in your hell and I in mine . " She took his head between her hands and touched his lips with a long foam-light kiss , stood by him with her hands softly alive over his eyes , whispering he must rest and sleep . Then she brought a chair and sat in quiet , watching him ease away into the rest his body and mind sought . Robert Hears the Saga of MimIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armful of white roses and a handful of pansies and two crimson damask roses . With these heavy white roses , a fall and a droop to their leaves and a fold over fold of the petal curves , she made a long thin oval around the body of Locke in his shroud . Here and there a black-andgoldpansy set its punctuation in the white-leafed oval . Above the two hands and touching the first-finger knuckles she laid the blush-red damask roses . She took a chair next to Robert and her voice reminded him of the thin blue silk of the token kerchief . She was saying as between the two of them , " A long journey  --  no harm in a few emblems  --  black and gold for midnight and dawn  --  white and endless white for the immortalpart of him that 's gone and can never molder . " P587Till midnight they kept that room alive with their stillness and their sudden snatches of talk , remembering this and that of him , Winshore , Robert , Mary and Mim , and for a time Jean Shepherd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet-nursed him and brought him along and now wept and cried , " He was purty fer a baby and he purty now fer a man . Gawd , he nevah look so like his fathah . " Cynthia George came for a while and vanished as quietly as she came , having kept her chair to the wall , seeming to be aware preciselywhat the evening was about , seeming to represent many of like sorrow who could n't come . Occasionally one or two rose to stand at the coffin and gaze on the face , to marvel at the fixity of the eyes never to open again and the mouth never again to give forth a syllable of speech , in awe at the irrevocable fact of death . Robert sat as a grave changeless stone when the father told of Locke at the statue of Pitt in New York giving an imitation of his brother declaiming Pitt 's famous lines in sympathy with the American colonies . Later Mim sensed a complicated tenderness in Robert 's telling of the deep and sure bonds that had grown between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Ann to hear the news . A subdued woe came from the father in pointing to the strides and growths he had seen in Locke since the boy went into the army . In time he would have been a colonel with his own regiment and later a general . The family had lost a rare boy , the country a great soldier . They buried Locke early the next morning in a grave next to his mother 's , between two small cedar trees in a square marked by four Lombardy poplars . The minister read from the Bible favorite passages of Locke and his father including the verses , " Charity vaunteth not itself , is not puffed up , " and " Blessed are the meek , for they shall inherit the earth . " From a worn and much-thumbed copy of Common Sense the minister read paragraphs that Locke knew by heart , then two verses from the " Liberty Song " : " Torn from a world of tyrants , beneath the western sky We formed a new dominion , a land of liberty : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such will ever be . Huzza ! huzza ! huzza ! huzza for love and liberty ! . . . " The land where Freedom reigns shall still be masters of the main , In giving laws and freedom to subject France and Spain , - And all the isles o'er ocean spread shall tremble and obey The prince who rules by Freedom 's laws in North America . " " Two years of storm  --  and he is ten years older  --  his face scraped and furrowed ten years older  --  his knees and elbows older and his right knee joint with its pitiless flashes that still keep coming , the boneP588joint a hundred and two hundred years older than when I first met him in Boston two years ago . " This was Mim talking to herself about Robert as she saw him in the days after Locke 's death . " His kisses are less swift and lingering , " she said . " Yet I have had slow long kisses from him now that hold the pity of night stars and seadrench in them . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tang of bittersweet I would rather have on my mouth than highly praised honey or candy sweet . " The father saw to it . So did Mary . Robert must have care , attention , rest , sleep , no wearing excitement , so they told Mim , no long visits , no long talks , rest , sleep , and whatever might give his mind quiet and his heart consolation . " You are thoughtful , " said Mim , letting them know she had earlier considered seeking out Robert but she had kept from going to him afraid of what the shock and tumult of their meeting would do to him . When she did go to him it was not of her planning . When she sewed a shroud on the day of July 4 , " I couldn'talwayssee the work I was doing half-expecting it was to wrap Robert . " They should understand , too , that she had heard Robert tell , and the telling eased him or she would n't have let him go on with it , of his hard and humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after the evacuation of Boston melted half away , of his escape from starvation and death in snow and ice on the Kennebec . When he became too graphic in the mean , the scrawny , the devastating details of what he went through on the Kennebec she would interrupt and lead him away . " He was out of his mind for some days , I 'm sure , " said Mim . " And when you try to tell someone else how it happened and how you came out of it , you can make desperate work of it . " Mim saw Winshore and Mary look in each other 's eyes with meaning , enough for Mim to know they understood she herself had probably gone out of her mind and if she were to tell Robert about it she would do so gently and delicately , with healing rather than hurt for him . That Robert had told her of his meetings and walks with Ann Elwood and how close he had held Ann and how at cost he broke away  --  of this Mim could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh was gone in these clays . At meals or in his chair at a writing table Mary and Mim had noticed him drop his hands and stare at nothing in particular for a while . His talk had less of banter and fantasy . He sought out in her alley cabin the old Negro woman Emmeline one afternoon and mentioned this visit casually at home , " I wanted to talk with her about how it felt to handle Locke and throw him around when he was a baby learning to walk . " In two weeks he would be going , said Robert . The way he said it had finality . He had been where hard decisions are made and men accept those decisions and do the best they can by what of necessityP589and fate follows . The others in the house , including Jean Shepherd and Mim who came to stay two and three hours every evening , offered their gentle hints to Robert that another two months of rest and regular meals , with a dry corner to sleep in , would bring him back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better soldier for heavy duty . They gathered by his quiet answers that he had thought it all over . The shame was on him of half the army leaving General Washingtonafter the siege of Boston , leaving for comfort and fun and grudges against officers and discipline , leaving after months of sleeping on the cold ground again to slide into the clean sheets of a bed with a rainproofroof and again to put arms around a wanted and cherished woman . In that kind of shame , the result of seeking personal pleasures and gratifications , he was going to have no part . The longer he put off a decision and lived at ease and " resting , " the more would be the danger he might take the course of others who had meant to stay home for a few weeks and had never come back to the army . An edge of sarcasm had cone into the way he could say the word " resting . " " If his scorn of rest , which is near to a fear of rest , deepens much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you can see he will probably get more true rest with the army than here . " The women agreed . He came from a world with its own secrets , the army of men whose world was shock and tumult and blood when it was n't dreary monotony or camp fever or a variety of disorders of men without women , the longing for home , the heaviness of no escape from the pettiness and arrogance of supposed " superiors , " the hurt of seeing good men go to pieces . A shirt of finespun gray wool Mim was sewing for Robert , and she said , " I make it loose expecting you will gain twenty pounds . " " Shrewd enough , " said Robert . At the house while they chatted of evenings Mim made complete repairs of neat patches and restitchings on his uniform . She had asked to replace his old stockings with a new pair from an assortment at Cynthia George 's store and Robert preferred she would darn the holes and tears in the old pair . " I 'll begin where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , as often before , Robert 's eyes drew to her face and held to a steady gaze as he tried to fix his mind on what was the change that had come over her . More thin , more gaunt she was , more down to bare bones yet nothing sickly or weak about her as with him . She seemed to have some sure strength not there in the old days . She seemed tireless of body and mind and perhaps never so quick and clever with her hands and so ready-witted at any given moment . Her mouth lay as a vivid wafer of pale plum blossom wind-blown and held fn n on the day-white bone structure of her face . When her full wide smile came over the even white teeth the lips spread tighter and moreP590round and full . Her head of chestnut hair , done with skill in plaits and ropes , shone rich as ever with the same changing slight burnish of bronze as the light on it varied . The eyebrows hung thick and twisted in comic shags , the one feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as before varied , from a deep sea-blue to a stormish green . The impression came to him she had been hard-worn and haggard , everything failing her except those clear unfailing eyes . This was the evening he would n't be put off . " I can stand it if you can . The dark journey you called my story when I told it . Now I must hear your dark journey , even if it hurts you a little to tell it . " " It 's part of my bones and blood now . I 'll make it short as I can and pray it wo n't hurt you . " She smiled faintly , a mild swift grimace over her face , the odd stretch of skin made luminous by the white bone curves underneath . Robert read it , or believed he did , and it sent a glad streak through him , for that look in the old days cried a proud abandon . Now it still held abandon , a reckless flair , with a touch , more than a touch , of austerity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . She had never before been hunted . She had been watched , innocently unaware she was watched . And suddenly she found herself looking into eyes of quiet contempt shading to anger when they questioned her and got nothing of what they wanted , the voices of Lieutenant Francis Frame and two other officers coaxing her and keeping perfect manners and later with harsh reprimands asking her if she knew what was the penalty for a spy in wartime and did she know that a spy was a treacherous rat that met no mercy . This began on the day after Robert made his escape from Aunt Ellen 's house , the afternoon when she told Lieutenant Frame under no conditions could she give a pledge to inform them at any time she learned of a return of Robert Winshore to Boston . Where was she on the night that Sapphira Reggs saw Robert Winshore participating in an infamous crime on the person and property of Hobart Rcggs ? What did Robert Winshoretell her of that affair ? How could she lie and repeat her lie that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry with him , walked over Boston with him , frequented with him " that Rebel pesthole " the White Cockade and the bookstore of that Rebel Henry Knox , yet in all of this Winshore gave her no hint of the Reggs atrocity ? How could she likewise falsely declare she continued an intimacy with this dastardly traitor and she learned from him no fact nor detail of the criminal act perpetrated on the respectable Loyalist Silas Ludgate ? Had she not stationed herself in the Cavendish dress shop with its distinctive British and Loyalist patrons with the expectation of there gathering information of service to the outlawsP591and incendiaries who termed themselves Sons of Liberty and her intimatefriend Robert Winshore one of its most active members ? " They seemed to know everything about who came and went and what I said in the shop and who I went with and where . " And it came out they believed Mim had pressed and pried the wives and daughters of British officers and Loyalists seeking military information . It came out further that they had this information from little dollfacedJane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be supported , we could hang you , " Lieutenant Frame had told Mim very gravely . Robert 's eyes held a queer dull blaze and Mim said , " Now I think I know how your eyes looked when you sighted your musket at the first enemy soldier you killed . You must n't get mad now . What I 'm telling you is over and past and part of it is funny . Do n't you think it 's funny that little odious draggletail puss Jane Haddam should have been chosen for a spy , she with her spite and jealousy and naturally a liar even when talking to herself ? " Robert grinned . The queer dull blaze was gone . He admired her for what she was n't telling . For a person of her extraordinary pride and sensitivity to be hauled before accusers who questioned her every act and word , and this being her first experience in such an ordeal , she could have mentioned it but would n't trouble him . She could have said there was anguish in her attempt to answer their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how many nights has he slept with you in your Aunt Ellen 's house ? " She had hesitated and finally answered , " I refuse to reply to unwarranted questions deliberatelyintended to be insolent . " Mim had finished the stocking where one big toe stuck out and begun on the other where three toes could wriggle through . They had questioned her six hours straight the first day , the officers taking turns at trying to wear her to a breakdown . They seated her on a chair with no back to it . They wanted the names of any and all persons she associated with and what she had learned from those persons of the membership of the Sons of Liberty , of guns , powder and provisions being procured and where stored . Her answers they took as those of a liar who could n't be so completely ignorant as she pretended . It was beyond their belief she could have been so close to Robert Winshore for so many months , with so many endearments between them noticed by others , and not be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sons of Liberty . Overnight she had a small room with a guard outside the door , permission to send word to Aunt Ellen refused . The second day six hours without food , again the chair with no back to it , again the officers taking turns at questioning her . They brought in a Bible , tried to put her under oath in her statements and she refused . " What is the Bible and God between you and me ? You would n't believe me today if I should swear to every word of it on a stack of Bibles . " P592They wanted to use her to bait and trap Robert Winshore and others . Finding they could n't use her they told her she must leave Boston . They gave her a pass allowing her and Aunt Ellen on a cart with some goods to go through the lines . Parting with Mrs. Cavendish came easy . Mrs. Cavendish was frank to say , " I 'm afraid , my dear , you gave our place a bad name . I have had my own loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shop stands empty . Not a new piece of work in three days , the Rebels surrounding Boston . It is as well you are going , my clear . " Mim kissed Amelia Gray , put her arms around Evelyn Trutt to hear her " We will meet again , my boy outside sends word they will take the city . " Then Mim looked Jane Haddam in the face . " And , would you believe it , I hesitated whether I should call her an odious draggletailedpuss or merely a nasty little bitch , and then I did manage to lock my lips and turn away from her and walk out forever and ever from the Sign of the Golden Ball . " The spring weeks and summer months went by on the farm in the by-lane near Lexington . The work of the farm fell on Jake , Deb , Aggie and Mim , with Aunt Ellen tending the lightest of household duties . The father suffered with his arm and shaky nerves . The few days he did n't suffer he sat sullen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reset the splints , the doctor saying the second time there had been no need for him to call , and to the girls , " He is a little peevish , I would say , it 's mental with him , he 's too queasy . " And Noah Wilming persisted over the summer that his arm was n't healing , it hurt for him to walk with it ; he must lie quiet or sit still . Weeding among the carrots and cabbages , in the bean rows and the turnip patch , the daughters and Jake stooped and knelt day after day , taking turns at the farm work and the housework and kitchen chores . In the potato field and among the corn rows Mim blistered her hands on a hoe handle and went on and grew calluses , winning a burst of laughter from Deb and Aggie as one afternoon she stood in checked gingham and with sweat running over the sunburn of her face , " I 'll be blamed if there ai n't a difference between a hoe and a needle , burn my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in previous years had helped Darius and were not the strangers like Mim to spells of work near-backbreaking . Her bones sore and her muscles stiff , their vibrations woke Mim and put her to sleep again in the first days of weeding and hoeing . She said she would get used to it and she did . She ate supper after sunset and right off went to her room to slide out of her clothes and fall onto the bed fairly asleep before she was in the sheets . In the plowing not finished by Darius , in the sorting of seeds and planting over May and early June , the mother worked harder thanP593any of the others , saying as she had for many a year , " Work is good for whatever ails you . " They saw Ma struggle to go on when an attack of dysentery came in early June . They saw that malady wear her down and overcome her strong will . For a week or two she managed to make a pretense of helping around the kitchen and they heard her say bitterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was up , " I 'm give out . You know me . I 'm give out . " Mim let down gate bars , drove cows from pasture , pulled at the teats with a pail between her knees , put the milk in crocks in the cellar , skimmed off the cream and churned it to butter under an apple tree near the cellar door , padded the butter into a small bucket she let down the well to keep cool , carried part of the skim milk to the two calves , poured the buttermilk in two pitchers for the supper and breakfast tables . When the flies swarmed thick in the cow stalls , she expected every so often a kick in the shins or knees and a pail of warm milk spilled . At haymaking time she joined with Jake , Deb and Aggie in handling a pitchfork , her calico dress sweat-soaked on sweltering July days , hayseedin her hair and down her sweating neck and back . Mim left the others one Sunday morning in June to go alone and stand where Darius lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Below her feet there his earthly frame had moldered and corruption worked at the shag of brown hair down his forehead and the sockets where the brown eyes held no more the liquid glow she could never forget . There was this dust of him underground mute , corrupt . There was another dust of him , a thin invisible impossible dreamdust that lived on in her and that would live on beyond her little life . Ilow this could be ran over and up and down her mind as she heard the sonorous and valiant Jonas Parker in his pulpit . " In church that Sunday , " Mim was saying to Robert as her knitting needles progressed at the stocking toe hole , " on my knees weeding the carrots and bending with the hoe along the corn rows , I began to see what had happened to me those three years in Boston . You ca n't help what people do to you . You ca n't be proof against the people you see every clay . They have their ideas , beliefs , rumors , notions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your blood and talk . I saw early that neither side , Tory or Whig , could be as high and holy , as pure and perfect , as righteous and straightforward , as they pretended to be . And I told myself I would be as holy and pure a spectator as they were participants . There grew in me , though I did n't know it , a comfort and self-satisfaction about sitting on my pleasant perch above the strife and bickering , a witness of the hate and scorn yet not a part of it . I got smug . I did n't realize how smug and superior I had become after two years of it when I first met you . You were the first Rebel to throw Rebel ideas straight in my face . I did n't like the evangel in you . That 's what you were , an evangelP594of American Independence and freedom . You saw I did n't like it at first and still more later when it was plain , though you would n't talk about it , that you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberty . They were a threat to my dream and hope , snuggled in my heart and fastened with deep roots , a place of our own , a sweet home for us two . I had a jealousy I did n't dare show of anything that meant danger to that home . I made a hoard of happiness , you might say , of our future happiness , the things we would do and have after a wedding . I took that hoard out to count it and fondle it like a crazy miser handling his gold he will never spend . I saw you were moving in the works of the oath-bound Sons of Liberty , secret works . Those works shook you deep . They aimed to terrify the enemy and show him your will stronger than his . I saw this shook you far deeper than our little love . A fright came over me that you could love a secret organization , working in blood and terror , more than you loved me . Fright and jealousy ate in me and wore me . I began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recoiled in myself and writhed and twisted and flung paradoxes , follies and taunts , at you . " At Darius ' grave , on my knees weeding carrots , with a hoe in the corn rows , this began to come clear to me . Lexington , Concord and Bunker Hill , they helped , of course . Men who could fight like that against the world-famous British Regulars , I said they must have something not reported by the patrons of Mrs. Cavendish and the Sign of the Golden Ball . I had heard too much gabble of no meaning in that dress shop , not merely political gabble but endless prattle of style and fashion , women peacocks and ape men who believed in money and show like a religion , who did n't know for all the finery and spangles they put in their parties and cotillions they were still peacocksand apes . Vanity of vanities , thy name is vanity , ' I babbled to myself once looking at the hoe-handle blisters on my pretty hands and taking a fierce joy in those blisters and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Robert . " They 're not gone yet , you see . " Ile had already noticed , he said . He liked them . Early September Noah Wilming died . IIe seemed to want to go . " Useless , " they had heard from him that summer , over and again , " so useless , " with an arm no good when it should heal , worries and vagaries on his mind . Bunker Hill should have been won and held . The Americans should have stayed and slaughtered the enemy and held the hill . Then his last three days he brightened , his face and eyes with exaltation in them . " Noah Wilming , died in the Battle of Lexington fighting for his country , died of his wounds September 8 , 1775 . " They could put that on his gravestone , he said . They suddenly loved and admired him , all of him , those last three days . They kissed his face . He asked to kiss them each on the lips . He lay with eyes closed and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on long , longer than they think yet it will win because , in the name of God , you ca n't conquer unconquerable men . " Then a pause and , " Am I one of the unconquerable men ? " Dreamily he asked it as though it might be and as though it would please him , not much but a little . Then his eyes opened again , " Mim , am I one of the unconquerable men ? " " You are , papa , we all say you are . " His eyes closed . " Kiss me , Mim . " She touched her lips gently to his and whispered , " Dear papa . " Then a long pause , his breath coming slower , and they believed their cars caught him saying , " Her hair always so pretty , far back when she was a little girl I liked Mim 's hair . " And they heard no more from him . The spring weeks and early summer months had gone fast for Mim . Blue sky , drifting clouds softer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped , so did clouds piled and rolled taller than mountains , growing corn ears with rusty brown silk curling out , leaves with a changing rustle as the vivid fresh green of mid-July shifted to pale sun-dried green in late August . She remembered again farmers she had heard , " I can hear things grow , " and she tried her cars and believed she did hear the hay , the corn growing , and especiallythe pumpkin and squash hills . " You pitch in pretty good , Mim , " her mother said one day . " Deb and Aggie like it . They 've come to approve of you like never before . " " You would n't say that , Ma , without I had , " Mim replied and was pleased . " I guessed maybe only Jake would be sure to approve . " Jake adored her as before , perhaps more , Mim saw , for it was she who had always spoken up for him , always Mim who said she would rather have his peculiar kind of brightness than what some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a twisted face Jake had said to her the first day she was back , " Things here just like they was before the war , now they 're inside out and upside down . " He had been once to Boston and had his opinion , " Boston is purty to look at if you like to see the twitters . " They hurried too much in Boston . " It gives them the twitters , and when they get what they want , they want more of it . " his mind working alone had reached around to some certainties . " If you know too much it makes you sick and if you do n't know what it is you 're sick with , that 's bad and you might as well he plain ignorant . " He told Mini he had learned how and when to keep his mouth shut . " If I 'm going to say something and it does n't sound right in my head I do n't let it get to my tongue . I notice most men have a respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous , and they never know what he knows till he gabbles . " He was seventeen now . With Darius and the father gone , he was the manP596of the place , not rugged and tireless as Darius , " but he 's takin hold and gettin to man-size in a way I 'm proud of , " said the mother to Mim . The orchard near the house was a sort of book that Mim and Jake read and shared . Half the trees , slowly dying , took their time . Two gnarled and spreading trees had n't blossomed in three years and this year they burst into a flowering white cloud and red apples that ripenedsoon and fell early and when Jake and Mim bit into them they were a flat pulp of no taste and they spit it out . One small old tree in a corner with currant bushes and rhubarb for neighbors gave small sour apples that set the teeth on edge but when those apples lay yellowed in the sun ten days they had a wild and racy tang and Jake and Mim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with shrunken skin worth two bites for their queer flavor , worm-eaten apples so fresh and tasty you ate all but the worm and its path , and not often enough came the apple so perfect you ate all but the core , seeds and stem . Red-check , pudding-sweet , long-nose , were names Jake had for some odd ones . Along a cow-pasture path where wild crab apples fell to the sod it pleased Jake to hand one to Mim begging her to take one bite so he could enjoy the quizzical pucker of her face . Summer had eased into autumn , more chill and haze in the air , plant leaves wilting and turning brown and crackling , spots and splashes of umber , yellow and crimson over the trees and woodland . The earth had laughed a harvest but the reapers could n't take a real glad laugh till it was gathered and dug . The mother was still weak and could n't join but the others were up early and going late with cutting corn , digging potatoes , turnips , carrots , heaping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn corners and bins . Ten-minute snatches of time for reading , a half-hour once in a while on weekdays , two or three hours on Sunday with her books , for that much Mim had been thankful . With the crops in came more time with her beloved books and her occasional scribbling . Mim at one holiday gathering with neighbors picked up from a fellow who sang it forty times for the girl he was to marry : Oh , the fox and the hare , And the badger and the bear , And the birds in the greenwood tree , And the pretty little rabbitsSo engaging in their habits , Have all got a mate but me . Toward November 's end Mim gave nearly all of her time to her mother . The summer attack of dysentery had returned , the doctor said , in a more malignant form . It had been epidemic in some parts of New England . Ruth Wilming wasted away and became a mildewed reminiscence of the strong woman who through life had never wanted others to do for her , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother , P597a care and hindrance , to others . " I 've never learned how to complain and it hurts me to . " An early December night it was and snow all day in a driving wind gone down at dusk . From the house windows they could see the five cedars snow-mantled in a still starbright gloaming . Ruth Wilming made her weak gestures , pushing away food offered her , opened and closed her eyes in the only speech left her . By the light of two candles on a table near her pillow and a rigid shiver of a moment that came to the body , they knew she had gone at about the hour she wanted to go . They had all seen woe and grief come to the house but nothing like this . Ma Wilming had become part of every door , window and floorboard of the house . Here under this roof she had borne each of these children who now wailed , fell on each other 's shoulders , wept and shook . Darius could go this year , the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the land and themselves as having a root center , a wheel with a hub , a clock with a mainspring . They were her brood . She was gone . And now they accused themselves , each feeling a guilt about words and deeds they could have spoken and done for her while she lived . Now they knew they had leaned on her more than they could have believed and they held depths of affection for her that could well have been spoken more often . When they sobbed , " Oh , Ma , " and called to her now it was like nothing before in their lives . Jake perhaps had better hold of himself than any of the other children . They found it soothing to see him in a chair at her pillow , sometimes leaning forward to lay a hand on her icy forehead , then with an utter quiet on his face and a new solemn look on it , near a whisper , " She 's better off , she suffered so . " Aunt Ellen kept hid except for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two years younger than herself , and kissed the mouth and brow and went away , dry-eyed and at no time wailing . " She hides . it , " said Deb , and Aggie agreed , " Yes , dear Aunt Ellen , it 's there but she wo n't let on it is . " They buried her next to the father and near the ground that held Darius . They came home to a house where every doorway kept her shadow , every corner and utensil echoes of her voice . Mim would eat little , talk little , on the third day after the burial kept to her room , telling Jake in the late afternoon when he asked what he could do for her , " Leave me alone , Jake , I have to work it out for myself . " To Deb and Aggie , Jake said , " Mim is takin it harder than any of us . " He could n't go further and tell how Mim had hinted to him when Ma 's suffering was at its worst in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great wrong to Ma in leaving when she went away to Boston and in staying away so long and in not coming out more often to the farm where Ma always said her visits did a world of good . Jake could remember Mim 's words backP598there in the summer , " I wonder if I 've got into a habit of going out of my way to do wrong to people I love . " Jake had rolled that over in his mind for a few days and then said to himself , " There must be others too she thinks she 's done wrong to and she do n't want to talk about it . " Jake had gone to the barn to tend a sick calf and to finish shoveling a path to the barn in the foot-deep snow . He was walking back to the house , taking notice it was like to an hour till sunset and a clear sky for the stars to move out on . His eyes near the house caught foot tracks leading off through the orchard and over toward woodland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made those tracks . Then suddenly he made a dash for Mim 's room , broke through the door , saw she was n't in her room , and ran down to tell Deb and Aggie to come along and Aunt Ellen to stay on watch at the house . Jake ran back for a lantern and a flint , ran and caught up with Deb and Aggie following the tracks Mim had left in the snow . The trail ran on fairly straight across pasture land , into thickets where no path led , zigzagging through woodland . She had leaped a brook , hesitated there , walked back and forth by swift waters sliding over flat rocks with streaks of rust and moss-green . They were going to shout , all their voices together crying , " Mim ! 0 Mim , where arc you ? " but decided it might not be for the best . They followed the aimless winding foot tracks and suddenly came into a clump of pines , no snow on the ground , a thick matting of pine needles . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pine , rising to her full six feet of height and pride , Mim in a cloak of finespun gray wool with fur edging and a fur collar and below they could sec it was over a gown of blue satin , then black silk stockings and furlinedovershoes , her Boston dress for cotillions and parties  --  and her bare head of chestnut hair gleaming with a few fluffs of snow on it from thicket branches . They had never seen her in these fine clothes . They did n't know she had such clothes . That she could run away as she had was strange enough and that they should track her down to meet her in such a costume was equally strange . What did they want ? Did n't they know all she asked was to be let alone ? Her questions came in a swift babble , a little thick-tongued . They drew to within two and three feet from her and her warning came , " Do n't you dare touch me . " They stood waiting . They saw her tremble . It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the cold too , the December air that had frozen a thick ice on ponds . Jake spoke , coaxing and tender , " You 're shivering , Mim , come home with us where it 's warm and you can eat something . " She would n't . " Do n't come near me . Do n't you touch me . " They waited in the cold winter silence , Mim cold and mute , and dusk coming on . " You 've got to go with us , Mim . You ca n't stay here and catch yourP599death uh cold . " This was Jake , less coaxing and more firm of tone , a note of command in it . " You must come , please , Mini , please , Sis , you must . " This was Deb and Aggie pleading , tears in their voices . " Do n't come near , " came the terrible words . " Do n't you dare touch me . " Then we 'll have to take you and drag you , by God , " came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stay here . It 's gettin dark and we got a mile to go and we ca n't let it be on our conscience we let you freeze to death . " Then no word from Mim . She stood dumb and defiant . " Will you come along or will we have to drag you ? " came Jake 's fierce cry again . No answer coming he stooped toward her and tried to take her by the hands . She pushed him in the face with a furious shove that sent him reeling back . " Come on , Deb , come on , Aggie , " yelled Jake as he threw himself at Mim and brought her to the level of the pine matting . How long it took from then on , how long the fight lasted , how long the wrestle and the struggle before Jake had brought twine out from a pocket and tied her wrists while she struck , pounded , bit and scratched , none of them could tell afterward . Nor how Mim was pushed and led and dragged and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and home . " It was the next afternoon I awoke , " said Mim to Robert as she laid aside the stockings and the needles , having darned the toe holes and various large and small holes , holding the stockings up and laughing , " They 're nearly as good as new , " and going on , " Yes , the next afternoon I awoke . They had poured hot rum into me and a sleeping drug that Aunt Ellen had . I was in a warm room with a blaze in the fireplace going and in the bed where you saw Darius die , the same bed where my father and mother had died that year . It came over me I was alive though I 'm not sure but I had meant to join them . Jake sat in a chair by the bed . He had a pan of parched sweet corn . He enjoyed the grinding noise his teeth could make on parched corn . Not a word did he say , he just went on grinding corn with his teeth and a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happened , Jake ? ' He answered , We 're proud of you , Mim . ' Then my eyes caught scratches on his face and what seemed dry blood on one ear . I looked at my wrists and they had been scraped raw and ointment put on them . I held up my arms to see black-and-blue spots and bruises . My head ached and there were aches over my body . " I tried to sit up and I fell back . I was too weak to sit up . I closed nay eyes and I could hear Jake grinding parched corn with his teeth and I could hear him very softly , We 're proud of you , Mim , ' and if I should open my eyes I would see that sweet mischievous smile on his face . It used to be a pinched smile but now the pinch was out of it . P600As I rested wondering what he meant by their being proud of me , a prong of pain ran around in my head and the dull aches spread over my body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow I had not known in months . I had come out of something that had a hold on me . I had crossed a bridge . I had come out of a winding dark passage . " My eyes still closed I asked , Why proud of me , Jake ? ' and the grinding of his teeth on corn stopped and , Shall I tell it now , Mim , or wait till you 're rested more ? ' I asked him to tell it slow and easy and I would be listening . He had told the most of it when Dcb and Aggie came in , their hair like mine not yet smoothed out from the night before , their faces covered with wildcat scratches and Aggie with a bad bloodshot eye where my thumb had gouged her . They were sayingthe same as Jake . They had agreed on it . We 're proud of you , Mim . ' Then it all faded from me and they waited and I came conscious again and felt the shots of chilblains in my feet and they took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had placed there the night before when they were afraid my feet might be frostbitten . My fur-lined overshoes got pulled and kicked off in the fighting . " We all talked a little about what a wonder it was that the last I remembered was telling Jake to leave me alone and I did n't know how or when I got out of bed and put on my Boston dress-shop finery and sneaked downstairs and out into the snow . I had gone out of my head , lost my mind , what there was to lose . They said I got my teeth into Jake 's ear . They heard me yell , You say you 're Jake Wilming but I know you 're Robert Winshore . ' " Mim and Robert sat in one of their old-time silences for a while . " Robert , did you ever go out of your head ? " " Two days up on the Kennebec . The least I did was to curse Oates Elwood and tell him I would travel better alone . And I saw a deer he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could eat . " Again a silence and what was between them could n't be told . Then Mim , " My need , I saw then , was for only a little to believe in but that little must be strong and fastened with unbreakable thongs . It must be hard beyond any destroying and it must be soft too , thin as a dream . You ca n't put out your hand and touch the air and filaments of it . And if you clutch it and keep it to hoard and fondle like a miser , it will turn on you and bring you clown . You give and give from that little and it always renews itself . There is always more of it . I do n't know that what I 'm saying makes common sense . I do know I have two great passionate loves and I can live for them or die for them , either one or both of the loves . One is for you , the other is one that I join with you in , a consecration of ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren , of Darius Wilming , of Noah and Ruth Wilming , of John Locke Winshore , of a dream so deep in your eyes it is beyond fathoming . " P601She arose , leaned over and put a tight kiss on his mouth . " Now I must go . The little more there is of my story cart wait till tomorrow night . The command is you must rest . " " A night worth having , so much to remember , my darling , " said Robert , lifting his head toward her . " One more kiss before you go . " She put fierce lips to his a brief moment and swept away without another word . The next night Mim went on with her story . In the spring they sold the farm and moved to Aunt Ellen 's house in Boston , a week after the enemy sailed away . Aggie took up with a merchant , the wedding sudden , and she moved with him to Salem . Deb began working in the White Cockade . Jake was proving himself as a city teamster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mim helped as she could on the repairs and the remaking of Aunt Ellen 's house and did her thinking over a letter from Cynthia George who had heard of Mrs. Cavendish leaving her shop and sailing for Halifax with the other refugee Loyalists . Cynthia George was soon moving to Philadelphia and Mim might like a place with her . " Philadelphia , the Continental Congress , your father and your home there , " said Mim . " I would go there . I would n't get in your way . I would see what might happen . And now in God 's good time , see what has happened . " " It is n't over yet . Hard days to come , " put in Robert . " I am ready for them . I have been tried by fire . We have both been to hell and back . We know what the climate and weather is in hell . We 'll be at home in whatever is to come . " " Mim , I 'm afraid you 're too good to be true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no firewood all winter and miserable scraps to eat and the scurvy wearing at him , and he said , How 'll I know it from Boston when I get to hell after I die ? ' " With a mild grin Robert was asking , " Whatever became of that queer loud-mouthed rascal Captain Edelbert Hupple ? " " A rascal he was . He had no ship at Salem . He had fine clothes and a deal of gab . he went through a wedding with Mrs. Cavendish and got his hands on her money and took a ship for the West Indies . " " No ! " " Yes . " " And Mr. Hobart Reggs and his daughter Sapphira ? " " They sailed away nicely with the others . The mahogany spinet your Sons of Liberty broke , they had repaired that and they took it on board ship and to make room for others they had to throw it overboard . " " Which was worse than our smashing it . " " Yes . Sapphira 's baby you may be sure they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " P602 " She married the British officer she wanted . He was killed at Bunker Hill . " " A wild time we live in , Mim . " " A time of storm . " " Storm and dream , " said Robert . " I would n't let the storm whirl me , kick me , punish me , unless for the dream beyond the storm . It may be , in Tom Paine 's words , the birthday of a new world . And it may not . " The father had come in , fussing with the latch so they could hear him coming , and he was saying , " Hazard and risk  --  we are born , every child , every man and woman of us , to hazard and risk , from womb to tomb , birth-bed to burying-ground . Some live so careful , so prudent and anxious over their little hoards of money or love or power they clutch , that they die without having lived and you could write an epitaph for many of them and it would read : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOW HE SLEEPS HEREAS HE LIVED-DREAMLESS . " Nations too live at hazard and risk and when their rulers dream only of themselves and not their people you might say their soldiers die for a dreamless flag . Our American dream began years ago , its flag came into adoption late , and its Declaration to the world that it is an independent nation among the world states came only this month . It is the freshest young dream in the world . It is so daring a dream it will have to live by storm , inside its growing and lusty young body storm , and from outside forces storm . " " Papa . " " Yes , son . " " Talk on , you 're talking what ran low in me last month and is now come alive again . " " Enough I 've said perhaps for us to think about . It 's your bedtime , son . Robert kissed Mim and went upstairs . The father and Mim talked an hour . " The wonder of the dream keeps him , " said Mim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps him going . We will pray he keeps it . " " And we 'll pray we ourselves keep it . Love of country is a holiness that comes and goes and those too sure of it better beware . It exists as a wonder . It lives by vision , prayer and works . With high words and no works it is a hypocrisy and blasphemy . I tremble at calling myself a Patriot when I consider Joseph Warren and our boy Locke  --  and our boy Robert . " They stepped outside the front door . The summer stars hung low boaand timeless . She held his right hand in her two hands and on leaving said , " You have a heart of storm and dream . Pray for Robert and me . " P603Before Robert 's going away one incident broke the smooth flow of his recovery . He was writing copies of several involved resolutions passed by the Congress and from his chair at a table in a front corner of Carpenter'sHall he saw Mim standing by herself far at a rear corner . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sprightly uniformedcaptain , a rather handsome pink-faced fellow . There was more than admiration on her face , thought Robert , and on his too . He could see Mim in bright laughter at what she was hearing . Then later her face was serious and she seemed deeply moved . All of this that he had seen , he flung at her that evening , suddenly flung it in a burst of suspicion and jealousy . Why this pleased her Mim could n't tell . Nor could she let on she was pleased . " He will be here this evening , " she said . " He wishes to see you . He comes from Boston . " When he came Mim had the visitor tell again what he was telling her that afternoon . " Captain Edmunds , Roger Edmunds , the son of Bliss Edmunds , " she introduced him to Robert . He had visited his sister in New York last winter and they could n't get along on his first call and on his second and farewell call he was giving her a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of the lowest breed of Tories he had ever met . Then her husband in full British-officer uniformcame in and they had words that ended in a brawl , a fist fight where they bloodied each other 's noses , stocks and shirts and neither was winner and Captain Edmunds backed out of the front door hurling curses in reply to his brother-in-law 's vile epithets . Robert exploded in a rollicking belly laughter . Captain Edmunds , still on duty in procurement of munitions and supplies , told Robert of powder and provisions , how there was more than there had been yet there ought to be more for coming actions . The clash of Captain Edmundswith his sister and brother-in-law reminded Robert of two brothersin a well-to-do New York family , arriving home on the same afternoon , one in American and the other in British officer 's uniforms , and they drew swords and fought till each had brought blood on the other and a mother and sister separated them and ordered them out of the house . The night before Robert 's going away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Tozzer had brought a guitar and Robert sang " Come , Swallow Your Bumpers , Ye Tories , " to begin a merry evening . Robert had regained more than half his lost weight . The grayish clay pallor of his face had changed to a clean white and then taken on a hint of the old ruddy color . They had led him into staying a week longer than he planned . Now when they spoke of hisP604staying yet another week he would repeat General Washington 's phrase " chimney-corner heroes . " He had not been useless on " light duty " at the Continental Congress but now he must go . The father pulled a cork from a bottle of Madeira wine to go with oatmeal cakes Mim had made by Aunt Ellen 's recipe . Mim read lines copied from a letter of a son of Silas Ludgate , one of the hundreds of young Loyalists who had gone into enemy uniform . From his winter of duty isolated at Halifax the bright young Ludgate had written confidentiallyto a Boston friend : " A cursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . Bad times , my friend . The displeasure I feel from the very small share I have in our present insignificancy is so great that I do not know the thing so desperate I would not undertake to change our situation . " Mim did her new Declaration of Independence dance , precise and military with right-face , left-face , about-face and drumbeat clicks of heel and toe , then signatures , name signing with a pen , reverent slow shifts from one posture of prayer to another , exultation in a variety of fierce whirls , ending with an enigma of closed eyes , folded hands , her bony face with a plum-blossom mouth fixed mute and grim in acceptanceof whatever fate lay ahead . Robert strummed the guitar and she sang of " the pretty little rabbits , so engaging in their habits , " and sang it again because they called for it and there was no second verse . Cynthia George merrily read a verse by one " Bob Jingle , " from a letter of her boy . " Meant to be sarcastical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find fun in it , " andread : " With anxious cares and grief oppressed Our inmost bowels rumble , And truly we are so oppressedOur very guts they grumble . " Tozzer asked Robert to sing the " Liberty Song " of Joseph Warren . The father said , " It is exciting the way you give it , Robert . You know whether you should . " " That song tells why I 'm leaving tomorrow . " And he sang it defiant , vibrant , envisioning . Mim trembled , her plum-blossom lips a day-white pale . He finished and they waited a while hearing the clock tick . Then Ordway Winshore , " We are a fellowship of outlaws , carrying on a bloody rebellion . At least so they will write it if we lose . And if we win there will be , along this Atlantic coast and over the continent , statues and bronze memorials to those who fought it and won . " " You talk history , Mr. Winshore , " laughed Mary . " Yes and I must be careful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They ca n't see it in the making before their own eyes . " On a rested horse whose flanks had filled out , saddlebags packed . with a blanket , a pouch of roast pork , smoked fish , wheat bread andP605apples , Robert rode away in the morning . It was a laughing farewell , crackling with jokes and nonsense . They all wanted it that way . He turned a corner waving a blue silk kerchief . In the house Mary Winshoreput her arms around Marintha Wilming as the salt tears ran down a face still laughing . The 1777 TwittersTHE summer months of 1776 had gone by and the winds of autumn blown away the leaves of yellow hills turning gray . Early December it was when a Philadelphia merchant called on Cynthia George and handed her two letters , one for herself from her son , the other for Mim from Robert . " We have n't made much progress , " ran one sentence of Robert 's dry letter . " Our satisfaction is that while beaten we are not destroyed . " Mim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . She could read that Robert himself laughed at such a letter telling her what everybody knew , what the whole world knew , that the enemy had arrived at New York and Long Island with the largest expedition ever sent out from England , 35,000 troops with 1200 cannon on 400 transports convoyed by 10 line-of-battle frigates manned by woo seamen , that as the weeks passed the enemy had pushed Washington 's army off Long Island , off Manhattan Island , out of New York and over across northern New Jersey . " When I see you , blessed clay , I will tell you much more than can be put in a letter , " sounded more like the Robert she wanted to hear from , as did the ending sentence , " My whole love to you , always and ever and always . " Those words had to last in her heart many long weeks before she heard from him again . On the day Robert had swiftly written this letter and got it into the hands of the merchant going to Philadelphia , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner where he and Oates Elwood on scout duty had snuggled in overcoats and blankets among weeds and fence boards . The frost lay thick and white over their blankets at daybreak . They joked about their rheumatism being easier when they had plenty of wool cover . The sun had n't come up when Robert awoke and lapsed into a doze wherein a letter to Mim ran through his head . " Dearest Mim : P606Oat and I rode our horses where we saw the enemy transports crowded with men and cannon . It will be a long war , sweetheart . Do n't try to be cheerful . Make yourself hard and patient , if you can . This enemy ca n't be beaten in one campaign or two . We had double 8000 men , then we had 8000 in this army , now we 've got not quite 4000 and half of them under suspicion . To be in the field and see an army melt away with desertions and men 's enlistment terms running out , it gives you heartbreak . General Washington I am sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets a new heart every time an old one goes to pieces , I 'd like to hear . We have held on and how God only knows . It must be God who gives Washington a new heart when the old one breaks . We would have gone under months ago but for his heart and will . Oat and I ca n't figure out how it is Washington makes the army hang on and never give up . You can hear good officers say it 's more a mob than an army . We 've done some fighting , I wish to assure you . I saw hills lost in gun smoke at White Plains and felt the ground shake with the heavy guns going . " A ball took my horse in the neck and he sank under me and I slid off and it was n't easy to see him quiver and die , a middling horse that had shared a mess of trouble with me and I cried taking my overcoat , blanket and saddlebag off him before I ran for a piece of woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who surroundeda farmhouse , killed ten Hessians in the house , set a barn afire and shot two Hessians that came running out . We came where a cannon had been captured , two British officers , three British soldiers , two Hessians , piled around each other this way and that , all dead , all quiet . One of the officers glassy-eyed , his hands yet clutched a saber and a pistol , his eyes staring up as if he would like to get whoeverran a bayonet through his neck . Last week Oat and I riding along saw strips of cloth caught in bushes . We got off our horses and looked . We saw the body of a good-looking young woman , heavy-set with strong arms , hair like oat straw crisscrossed with blood , streaks of blood on her face . The men who killed her could have been our men or the enemy . There was n't time for us to look into what had happened . They had had their way with her . One man could n't have mussed her up like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had bruised her when she fought . And the dirty bastards cut off the third finger of the right hand . The ring on that finger would n't come off so they took along the whole finger . " About there in his dozing Robert came fully awake . He shook the frost off his blue three-cornered hat and laid it back over his head , snuggled deeper into his blanket and called , " Oat . " " Yes , Bobby . " " Have you ever tried writing a letter telling the whole truth about this dirty war ? " " I 'd never try unless I was obliged to . How could you tell folksP607that 's got a clean dry warm privy about the camp vaults we use ? the flies in summer , the ice in winter ? IIow could you tell about the poor devils with the quickstep and every day some of them do it in their pants before they reach the vault ? And the pogics with barrel fever  --  and the bleary they have to eat  --  and the scuffs every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that want to go home to mamma and the girls and a roof over their heads . " " That 's enough from you , Oat , do n't tell any more . " Dozing a while longer Robert thought of how he could put in a letter to Mim : " Oat is keeping something from me , I ca n't guess what . It is a secret with him and when he tells it to me at the proper time it will be a surprise and very interesting . Oat is solid . Oat is good . I value him . " A letter from Mim came to him and he wrote a letter answering , " It snuggles in my heart and sings there when I am wet or dry , hungry or filled . " And while he was waiting the chance of someone going to Philadelphia who would take his letter to her , a rainstorm came up one day and soaked his clothes and blurred the ink and he threw the letter into the next campfire he sat by . He would write it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddlebag . Then he read her letter to him again though he could nearly say it by heart . It read : I have moved to the house of your father and they have given me your room and I talk with the ghost of you and the echo of your voice kept here between these four walls . In the dark of the night and a rainfall on the roof I have come awake and heard your voice , " Mim , is that you ? " and I have answered , " Yes , my Robert . " Your father is in good health . There are now more days when he is short-spoken . He reproaches himself that he can not do more for the Cause . And he is sad because there are so many people indifferent about who wins the war and worse yet so many who like to make money by trading with either side and men supposed to be on our side who are not queasy about " frauds , cheats , and peculations " that will bring them money . He heard John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Unfaithfulnessin public stations is deeply criminal . But there is no encouragement to be faithful . Neither profit , nor honor , nor applause is acquired by faithfulness . But I know by what . There is too much corruption even in this infant age of the republic . Virtue is not in fashion . Vice is not infamous . " Terrible words : I would not dare send them to you did I not know you are more bitterly aware of them than we  --  and that you should know your father and John Adams are aware . One night when he was in a gloomy mood Mary and I talked and talked trying to draw him out of it and the only part he took in the talk that night was to remindP608us of the cathedral in Spain where a big clock on the front of it has the inscription : " Each hour wounds ; the last one kills . " Yet the next night he was laughing about how pleased John Adams is with the landlady he has found , Adams saying , " She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gilbert Tenant , the last and the fourth , and still is ready for the fifth husband and well deserves him too . " Your father is often gloomy now but please know his health is good and we have no fears about him . Mary , of course , is his precious one , always food for him . I imagine he would be rather lost without her , and she understandshim so completely and knows what to do for him . I remember you and I never stop remembering you and I make a business and a ritual of remembering you and I ca n't help myself in what I do in this remembering of you . If my body should of a sudden turn into a tall wisp of smoke blown away on the horizon I am sure even then I would be remembering you . I send you remembrance woven of our many flamesongs together . We have been shaped in a fiery furnace for each other . You , I know , are harder outside and more beautifully soft inside than you have ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think of me as part of you , our lives interlaced by thongs invisible and unbreakable . Please know what I am writing you here trying to end this letter . I would rather dance it for you or sing it for you , my precious , my only , my daystar by day and my voice at night in the dark . Mim could have added a postscript to this letter . She thought about that . But she did n't write it . Through her head the unwritten postscriptran : " A dish of squash , tender boiled yellow squash it was , made the trouble . I passed it to your father saying , The Indians gave it the name of squash . ' He took the dish saying , The Indians grow strong on it and so will I. ' Then he gave my hand a little pat to go with his joke . We turned to hear Mary saying , and her eyes blazing , Do you think that was called for ? ' During the rest of the meal the three of us merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at eating , finally Mary rising to leave the table saying in a choked voice , I hope it never happens again . ' She came to my room hours later and lay down beside me in bed that night crying it was the first time she had ever been jealous of him and asking me , Did I do wrong ? What was the matter with me ? Was there anything to it ? ' I got out of bed and lighted a candle and brought her the letter I wrote to you this Sunday afternoon . She smiled and was her old self . Things are the same again except I am sure he would never again dare to pat the back of my hand when I pass him a dish of tender boiled yellow squash or any other victual . I could n't quite begin to understand itP609till I got to imagining what I would have done if you were your father and I was Mary and some other young thing was in my place , I am that fond of you , Robert , and she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of us have the war twitters . When I said that to Mary everything was like before . Peace be to you , sweet soldier love of mine . " Thus ran through Mim 's head the postscript she did n't write , except for that last sentence . She did put that in , saying to herself , " It sounds sentimental , " and decided to add still another sentence that ran : " Of course I 'm sentimental about you , Robert , God , I 'm sentimental about you and you only . " " The Rebels are everywhere moldering away like a rope of sand . " Robert and Oat enjoyed quoting this to each other . A New York Tory newspaper , the Mercury , had printed it , with much else about Washington losing battles , forts , supplies , recruits , the confidence of Congress . Then out of nowhere Washington struck on Christmas night at Trenton , New Jersey , taking a thousand prisoners and piles of supplies , powder and guns . Then again eight days later out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy at Princeton , sent him flying with heavy loss , and then settled down in winter quarters at Morristown . " Looks like we intend to be in the way of the British if they try to move on Philadelphia , " said Oat . " The Rebels are everywhere moldering away like a rope of sand , " grinned Robert . They had seen in November an odd piece of a man serving as a volunteer aide on the staff of General Greene , a man five feet nine , a mobile mouth , a long curved nose , thick hair brushed straight back and not parted , and eyes that flashed and burned . A rather carelesslookingman except for those blazing dark-blue eyes . " So that 's the fellow who wrote Common Sense , " said Robert . " Yes , " said Oat , " so we know what is acting behind those eyes . " " We need more of his writing . " " Then we 'll get it . " In late December it came , a pamphlet titled The Crisis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly ; it is dearness wily that gives every thing its value , ' " quoted Robert . " It would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated , ' " added Oat . " " T is the business of little minds to shrink . ' " " But he whose heart is firm , and whose conscience approves his conduct , will pursue his principles unto death . " ' One paragraph they knew by heart and on Oat saying , " These are the times that try men 's souls , ' " he would hear Robert . " The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will , in this crisis , shrink from thep610service of their country ; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman . ' " Then Oat 's stern guttural , " The harder the conflict , the more gloriousthe triumph . ' " Their clothes , overcoats and blankets had seen wear and tear but Robert agreed with Oat , " We 'll try to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the hundreds of men in rags and strings of clothes , bare feet sticking out from holes showing through shoe leather and stockings , I feel like I do n't want to go among ' em with a new overcoat . " They did manage to draw new blankets , saying , " It 'll help our rheumatism , " which it did . Robert heard a soldier read a letter about New York Tories saying this year of 1 ' 777 was a bad number for the Rebels , " the year of the three sevens , " each seven a post with an arm , a gallows , wherefore this was to be for the Rebels , " the Year of the Three Gallows . " Oat said , " Years ago in Boston they had the answer to that joke . I was a boy when I heard people saying the big year for American independence would be the first year with three sevens in it . It could be this is the year , Bobby . I 'm not scared of three sevens . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with a smile as though they hoped so leastways and it ought to come true . " Mid-March it was that Robert noticed Oat sort of anxious . " Or is he anxious ? Sometimes he seems glad enough to choke about this thing he wo n't tell me . " They were sent on several scouting assignments that plainly annoyed Oat , so much so that Robert had to ask once , " You have n't got thetwitters , have you , Oat ? " " You 'll know all about it , if you 'll wait , " said Oat , " but it 's noteasy for me to wait . " A pleasant day the first week of April it was they rode their horses at a slow walk some five or six miles out of Morristown . " They ai n't had the best of feed and we 'll walk our nags , " said Oat . " It 's spring and you can see the grass peepin out . " " I ca n't wait to see what I 'm to see , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over you 'll know better why I 've hadthe twitters . " Oat would pull in his horse and ask , " Where is Henry Ingleside'splace ? " " Two miles mebbe , " came one reply . " You turn right at the second road , then to the left at the first road and it 's the fifth house . " Oat counted a by-lane for a road and they lost an hour before at last arriving at a two-story house of clapboards with a shingled roof and a big barn and a fat corncrib . They went in . It was noon and Henry Ingleside had come in fromP611plowing and they were having dinner . Both Henry Ingleside and his wife were very pleasant . " We ai n't got so much but what there is you 're welcome to it , " said Mrs. Ingleside as Robert 's eyes caught the face of another woman about to seat herself at the table . " Evelyn Trutt , our old Boston friend ! " laughed Robert and it was a laugh of joy . So this was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his eyes was the sweetheart of his army chum . And Robert saw Oat and Evelyn Trutt step over to a corner and hold a little talk between themselves . This was natural and Robert would have expected it . She was a rare woman . She was good for Oat . Beyond that Robert cared to know nothing . It was a great day . And Robert knew that Oat was enjoying this day . Then a door opened and in came  --  who were they ? Robert could hardly believe his eyes . This was Henry Tozzer , pale white , skin and bones ; a coughing spell shook him after he had weakly greeted Robert and before he had taken his chair . With him was Mrs. Tozzer , a sister of Henry Ingleside , and they had come here  --  Robert felt smittenand half-guilty about it  --  for Henry Tozzer , the Patriot , the revolutionary , slowly to pass away . And yet , said Robert to himself , there were grace and human sweetness beyond words that they should take in their kinsman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faces of the others he could see only affection for the wraith of the far-gone hero who used to shake New York City with his handbills . They sat at a table eating a tenderly boiled ham smelling of hickory smoke , boiled cabbage , boiled potatoes , pie made from dried apples , and Robert a little bewildered that he should be stowing away such tasty food before the wraith of Henry Tozzer and the baffling glances he saw running between Oat and Evelyn Trutt , faint smiles and knowing looks between the others . " I feel queer , " said Robert to ' himself . " There seems to be more here than they tell me . Or is my brain in a spin ? " Dinner over , the smiles and the knowing looks went around from face to face again . Then Mrs. Ingleside led the way , opened a door and they went into a room where a bed had an outlook on apple trees and rolling hills . Robert 's hands took hold of the arms of Oat and Evelyn Trutt as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still another face alongside the first one his eyes caught . " Ann ! " cried Robert in a low unbelievable moan . " Our Ann , my sister Ann ! " Oat Elwood was moaning . " You here  --  Ann Elwood , " said Robert , half-choking . " Ann Elwood Winshore , " came the sharp and almost delirious cry of Oates Elwood . " Your baby , " said Robert , staring with wild and glad surprise intoP612the large gray eyes of Ann . " Your baby and Locke 's baby ! and my nephew baby ! and my father 's grandchild ! " And Robert fastened his eyes on the baby , half-asleep and its blinking eyes a vague gray-blue with a faint hint of brown , its hair red , a brick-. dust red , Locke 's hair , Ordway Winshore 's hair . " Jesus , Ann , I 'm glad , God , I 'm glad . " And Ann knew she might never have another moment like this in all her life . For here were these two hardened veterans of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down their faces . Ann smiled . " Oh , you are all so kind I do n't know what to do . " She had a marvelous loveliness , thought Robert , her face day-white amid tosses of black hair . " For your sake and for Locke 's sake , Jesus , I 'm glad , Ann , " Robert faltered and fumbled . " I think he 'll be a real man , " smiled Ann with a nod toward the little fellow who seemed ready to doze off . " He may become a great American and carry on the fight you and Oat are in . " All of them drew chairs . They visited . They talked . It was all too good to be true . They laughed . They cried . Certainly Oat and Robert laughed and cried and felt in a way dazed , drunk and delirious . The baby three weeks old , Oat had fretted that he could n't get to see his nephew sooner . " What 's his name ? " asked Robert . " John Locke Winshore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The tears welled up in Robert 's eyes , ran down his face . " I 'm not ashamed , " he said . " I 'll cry about this and the most of it is a glad crying and I do n't care who knows it . And I believe Locke would cry with me about the wonder of it if he could be here . " Before sunset they must be in camp . They shook hands with Henry Tozzer as with a ghost for Henry Tozzer kept to his bed with his flickering flame of life and had got up from his bed for this special occasion . They could n't forget the fading fire of his eyes and his faraway voice saying , " The war may go long , boys , but the Revolution will win . " He was not a live flame , rather a burned-out ember of the Revolution . But his faith they could n't forget . " The Revolution , " Robert said to Tozzer , " now depends on Washington and we can tell you that Washington has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that , I like to think about it , " said Tozzer , a low ember light on his face . Oat and Evelyn Trutt begged for a little talk between themselves before going . They went to Evelyn 's room . Robert talked with Ann . Nearly strong enough to get up , she said . Three weeks ago the little one came . The doctor said the baby came easy and she was a fine mother . Only once did Ann become solemn and strange . " Oat will tell my feeling , " she said . " He understands , he will tell you . " P613The two soldiers rode away . They said nothing for a time . Then Oat , " You understand , Bobby , you must n't tell this to your father . Ann has some feeling I do n't quite understand . But you must n't tell him till she gives the word . You know how women are . They have their own ways . And Ann has a right to command us in this . Not a word to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been a wonderful day , Oat . Of course , I do what you and Ann say . " " We could n't help it , Bobby , we was all so sweet on each other we went and got married May last year , the four of us , Ann to Locke , me to Evelyn . " " Sweet days you had . " " Two days ' honeymoon then back to the war . " " That was all ? " " Another day in June for Locke and Ann then Locke and me made that ride to Philadelphia . " They rode along saying nothing , the spring sun kind , the hills and slopes coming out of winter sleep , a few robins flashing copper feathers , a pair of cardinals giving notice they welcomed spring . " Look like any marrying for you , Bobby ? " Oat broke in casually . " Might be after next winter the way I figure it now . I think so , hope so . " Visible Flesh and Invisible FaithGENERAL SIR WILLIAM HOWE , commanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant time in that city . Mrs. Loring , the Hingham woman who had become well known as his friend , had come along from Boston . He had time for parties , dances , social affairs . He seemed to have decided that a swift brutal war at all cost crushing the American forces might work out but a better course would be slowly and gently to extinguish the rebellion , sort of suffocatingit into submission rather than hammering and crushing it to a quick bloody death . A plan  --  or perhaps a whim  --  came to him . He put an army on transports in New York Harbor , i6,000 to i8,000 troops . They sailed away out of the harbor . The scouts , spies , informers of General Washington could n't tell him where this fleet of troops was sailing . What was their aim ? P614Where would they land ? Who were they going to fight and where ? Robert and Oat were among those who tried to get the answers for General Washington , tried and failed . For days across that summer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Washington and his generals puzzled , guessed , worried over the fact and point " Howe is moving his army  --  but where to ? " The answer came . Howe 's army was sighted off Delaware Bay . Could he be aiming at anything else than Philadelphia , the capital city of the Rebels , where the Continental Congress sat , where the big decisions came of the pretended government of the newly announced United States of America , where the Rebels had stores of ammunition and supplies at near-by Reading ? To the south , to Philadelphia Washington marched his army to meet Howe and battle for Philadelphia . On the way he would show Philadelphia his army , the people in that city more than a third Tory , less than a third Rebel , the rest neutral or mongrel . He would show them his army . They could see for themselves his marching thousands of veterans and raw recruits and make of it what they would . It might correct the impression in some quarters that his army had melted into thin air , existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delaware River and wheel into Market Street , the General sent word ahead , almost with the delicate ironic implication to the Tories , the neutrals , the mongrels , as though , " My phantom Army , you have heard of it , my pale ghosts of rebellion and treason , you have heard of them , they will march for you , before your eyes they will march along Front and turn at Market , and you may witness for yourself how airy and insubstantial they are , what figments of imagination , what figures of fantasy and rumor the battalions reported as fighting for American freedom and independence . " On the day of this march , early in the morning , two hours for each other had Robert and Mim , two hours , short , swift and breathless , so much to say , so little time for it , after one hour with the father and Mary .

That she and I should begin to snivel and explode at the recollection of such a thing , only demonstrated to me the barrenness of my youth and of my mother 's whole life before me . And this made me think again of how she was used to say the phrase , in the swim , which perhaps had meant in part owning and giving house room to such trumpery as the Chinese cupbearers . I thought , Holy Christ Almighty , why in God 's name could I not have been raised in a palace full of Flemish portraits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt , immediately I had thought it , that the bare thinking of the wish had been a shameful , disloyal act toward my mother , who had no control over the way her own youth was spent and less control perhaps over the taste with which she had chosen the things which haunted her house and my childhood . Therefore , I stood holding the dusty little pigtail , almost weeping , because the finding of it had brought up the ghastly chinachattering , hand-painted , begonged dining-room as it had been when my mother slapped me for every little inquiry I tried to make into the brummagem world I knew , because it disarranged her life of trinkets and possessive pronouns . Nevertheless , when I got down from the chair and out of her sight I gave way to tears , for I could not help it . Over and above all the rest of my mother 's treasure in the dining-room , Poor Yorick 's rich loot and the rest , there were still other possessions which lived there in a way which is similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . The dining-room table , a big varnished oak structure which pulled apart ( as if it were earthquake-shaken ground cracking into a fissure ) to receive a plug of extra leaves boards which slipped into it with little dowel pins and holes to make it long enough to accommodate company and my mother , father and me . When company was there with its knees under the table , was almost the only time I ever saw it used as a dining table , at all . ForP101most of the time , summer or winter , we ate in the kitchen , from kitchen plates with kitchen knives and forks . This god of the dining-room had five fat round legs , fluted and gingerbreaded , something in the manner of a fat wench drawn by Rowlandson or a German housemaid who suffered from a glandular affection . Each fat leg was equipped with a squeaking little caster so that it could be rolled about on the flower-twined Axminster carpet and so that it could be quickly stretched open and the leaves , which led warped lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . There was , however , little need for speed , for company seldom came unless plans had been made and allowed to mature for weeks , even months . And when it did come my bouts with the diningroom table were full of fear , for I always had to mind my manners , which consisted of keeping my spine straight and my hands in my lap and saying excuse me , please , and thank you , things which I had difficulty in performing properly because I was shy and believed , because of my mother 's fearsome aspect when she instructed me , that they were rituals which if omitted would cause my death or perpetual disgrace  --  and besides they were a terrible bore . I remember times when we would sit around this fatlegged table with some rustic cousins or long-forgotten acquaintances of a phase of my parents ' life I did not know , I would hear my mother say : Now Mr. Notestine have some more fried chicken and do n't you be like my cousin Amy who came to visit us one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Lee was born ? I believe it was because , I think it was the year that Mr. Harrington went to the World 's Fair in St. Louis  --  No , it could n't have been that year because it seems to me  --  I ' 11 just bet you it was the year all the birds got killed by that terrible storm in the park and Papa  --  my father  --  came home and said Nora you and Amy just ought a see those birds , they 're a foot thick , if they 're an inch . ) . Well , it does n't make any difference anyway , my cousin Amy , all the way from Philadelphia , was here , and we just had a fine visit . And well , we had fried chicken and Amy , who is just as polite as anybodycan be  --  a lovable disposition  --  always took the piece on top . Well , we wondered why Amy was so quiet when the chicken was passed around the table , did n't we Bob ? And do you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that , somehow  --  somehow he let drop that Amy said she always got the back because it just happened to be on top of the platter . He let the cat out of the bag ! And she had n't said a word to us about it all the time ! My , my ! Poor Amy ! Why I just hollahed and laughed  --  and I said to Cousin Charley : Myohmy , I just do n't see why Amy just did n't dig around . Why we 're just folks and she did n't have to be so strick about her manners . I just hollahed and laughed ! So you just dig around and find the piece you like best , Mr. Notestine ! In some way , though then I had no idea why , this sort of performance from my mother made me more shy and uncomfortablethan ever at the diningroom table . And I have seen several Mr. Notestines , or their female counterparts , look uncomfortable , not for the same reason I did , but because ( I am now sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the whole business of sitting down in the diningroom was too elegant and refined a thing for them to cope with , to say nothing of the fact that they had suddenly discovered from Nora that it could have been impolite to take a privilege she had urged them to take despite their manners . For some of these Notestines ( I thought of them as No-intestines , something like Marley 's Ghost ) had handled their eating tools with the most torturous flourishes and dagger-like grips I had ever seen . Indeed , I admired the intricacy of some of these methods of feedingso much that , having seen them once , I essayed to use them when the family circle was again in its own bosom , and we were eating in the kitchen . But my mother would click her tongue and say , Son , do n't hold your knife that way . Where in the world did you pick that up ? I thought I taught you properly . When I would answer : Mr. No-intestines held his that way , knowing that my mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would answer , Why , he did not ! Bob , did you hear that ? The child says Mr. Notestine held his knife like that . My father , scarcely taking his eyes from the plate would grunt , Yuh ?  --  for he had long since ceased to enter into any small controversial subject with my mother  --  and go on eating . But , Mamma , I would say over and over again ,  |p103he  did eat that way . I saw him . Well , Nora would say , still unconvinced , but willing to close the subject with a sort of suspended victory for herself , Mr. Notestine 's from the East . They hold their knives that way in the East . I knew then that it was useless to go on , and that no matter what I could ever say in these matters , my mother would win . And the No-intestines of the world would stand ever-victorious . I began to wonder about the East and saw it full of a strange breed of Mr. No-intestines and Mrs. No-intestines , their knives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I hated No-intestines , male or female , made me feel more timid and afraid and provincial and has lasted as a deterrent to successful dining throughout my life thus far . Most of my years I have thought of the diningroom as a big room . It must have had a fair size for Fork City for there was still more furniture in it : One piece of this was by the way of being backsheesh . The serving table , a goldenoak varnished thing with two shelves about five feet long , one near the floor and one at the top , with scroll work on its siding , was a premium from Dawkin and Co. , a firm of soap manufacturers , which dealt with housewivesin reduced circumstances and housewives eager to supplementor furnish forth their households with the fine and useful premiums they could win by selling soap , flavoring extracts , starch , blueing , clothespins and a thousand inferior emollients to their neighbors . I believe a woman , a neighbor of my Grandmother Beckham 's who was called Auntie Carper , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the many extracts and useless kitchen devices which helped to clutter the kitchen-cabinet . Anyway , there was a catalog which was kept in the china closet drawer , and to which my mother referred as my Dawkin catalog . She was always consulting this catalog and saying , as if it were a weighty matter , such things as : Do you know the next time I make up my Dawkin order I just think , I 'll get two dozen extra clothespins . They 're five cents less than what Prentiss 's basement get them for and I can apply that on my premiums . I do not know now what else besides the serving table was a Dawkin premium , but there were probably many things . Once , after Nora Beckham was dead , Ip104had a terrible and disheartening suspicion as I lay wakeful in the middle of a foreign night . Suppose that the china closet , Poor Yorick , had been a premium from Dawkin &; Company ? But that could never be . And , as I lay awake , the dull ghosts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing around my bedstead smirking at me , the idea that Poor Yorick might have been a Dawkin and Company premium ( for in the warmth of the moment for an old friend who never was an old friend , I had forgiven the chinacloset his scrolls , and swells and gingerbread and all his jailorlike characteristics of holding things incommunicado  --  I had forgiven him all his cheap dandyism and coxcombery ) was wellnighinsupportable , for had he not been my friend ? To suspect that he had come into this world as hardly more than a geegaw , a string of glass beads , with which an explorer in some primitive country might bilk the natives of their gold , threw me into a dark mood of selfabnegation for my disloyal suspicions of him . The serving table was not the only inhabitant of the diningroom , which , as an Oxford Scout , who was used to serving young gentlemen from the better public schools , might say , was out of its own social class . While the Dawkin premium piece was a little below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above it . It was acquired for a song through a fluke : A cavalry officer , who had been ordered out to the Philippines , from his station at Fort Davis , being a man ill-suited for the itinerant life he led , had allowed a wife , married without dower , to saddle him with bills , which he could not pay . Hence , to torture a metaphor , he was about to have his commission shot out from under him . One day my father was in this improvident officer 's quarters making a group picture of a chafing-dish party . The supper was being served from the buffet , and as my father posed the lieutenant and his guests around it , the lieutenant , his mood hinging on the futilitarian and ironic ( perhaps because of the wine , for he could hardly have been a man of much sensitivity or intelligence ) , said : Harrington , how much do I owe you ? My father , astonished at such an enquiry ( which rendered the man vulnerable to the paying of his debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was not much . Well , Harrington , do you see this piece of furniture ? Why the hell I bought it , only my wife can tell you . But we 're pot going to take it to the Islands . If you 'll cancel the bill , I 'll give it to you . And perhaps the warmth of the wine rising in a stronger wave from his belly to his brain , made him add : I 'll even have my striker load it on a G. I. wagon and fetch it to your house tomorrow . My father agreed . Thus it was that the buffet came to the diningroom . It was a long fairly high affair with three drawers and two doors of leadedglassbehind which lived more of my mother 's best dishes ( the samples of which were displayed in the china closet ) , a few silverplatedpewter bon bon baskets , a child 's sandbucket dated 1876 which an aunt of mine had used as a child at Atlantic City and given my grandmother for Auld Lang Syne ( it was hardly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , a few ancient Easter eggs from an Easter of my babyhood , my father 's lodge fez , more place cards , cut glass bowls and olive dishes and some more fans . The drawers were full of napkins , Brazilian drawn work doilies , crocheted luncheon sets , more lace doilies arranged in the same manner as those in the china closet with the good never-used ones the bottom-most . In the top , doubled by a long narrow oblong bevelled mirror , there stood a nickeled spiritlamp chafing-dish ( which had been lighted only once , for fear of ruining its glitter ) , a conch shell ( sent by my Great Aunt Alice along with a box of salt water taffy from Atlantic City ) in which a little black china pickaninny in white diapers sat , about to clench a set of white china teeth into a piece of china watermelon . I often wondered idly if , say , the little china boy set his white china teeth into the pink china meat of the little china watermelon , what would happen , would teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand little smithers and a clacking of breakage , or would it be as such things were with flesh and blood people , the china Negro chewing down the china watermelon with chewing sounds which clacked ( without breakage ) like a small bull in a small china shop ? And what would happen to his china digestion ? Of this decoration my mother would often say ( I believe I have heard her say it a hundred times or more ) when friends admired it , My , my , as the Old Darky says , he sho does like his watermillion ! Besides these main pieces the buffettop held a further clutter of hand-painted china . The buffet was over simple compared to the china closet for it had not a scroll or swell upon it , though it was of the same dark varnished oak veneer , and its drawerpulls were loops of the severestbrass . The only place where the furniture-maker had not been able to restrain himself ( I have often thought that the furnituremakersof the time must have come from some dark jungle prowled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures , something between fowl and feline , and beclawed and odoriferous with rapine and blood ) , was at the bottom of the three rather slim and graceful front legs where there were three taloned paws milled in the dark varnished oak placidly clutching the humdrum wooden casters . Though my eye told me that the simple lines of the buffet were much better to see than anything in the diningroom , Poor Yorick , the china closet included nay , better than anything in the house on Third street  --  I could never regard it as anything but an intruder who had haughtily and scornfully insinuated himself into our house , and like some British civil servants in the Orient or Africa , looked upon us with scorn and contempt , the very persons ( the natives ) who gave it sanctuary . For early in my life , I had encountered army officers from Fort Davis at my father 's studio , and though I had not been able then to put a word to it , I had noticed that they had a faintly patronizing air towards him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Oxford Blood might speak to his unpaid tailor . My father said nothing about this , for he was a shy man who believed in keeping his own counsel , but I knew , because of some special sensitivity between father and son , that it hurt and vexed him a little . He never directly admitted this hurt and vexation , for the garrison was part of our livelihood , but I could tell it from a look or a hum which he would let out when an officer and his wifep107would leave the studio after a trying sitting and he stood in front of the dark room door sighing , his Sunny Jim top-knot dishevelled by the focussing-cloth of the Century portrait camera . My mother too was aware of the fact that these army families , some of whom had battened idly on the United States Treasury and the reputation of a single political revolutionary General for four or five generations and some who had got into the cavalry because horses had long been a symbol of social and sporting success ( In good sooth , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialclimbers in only a little larger way than my mother was when she wished to be in the swim  --  my mother knew too that these people would scarcely bother to address even a patronizingly civil word to her , when she met them in the street . Yet her resentmentof this cavalier ( what snobbery the horse carries on his back ! ) treatment always masked itself in a rustic condemnation of their morals which was more than half shot through with envy  --  and , I am sure , must have set up a great bitterness in her heart . My my ! I have heard her say , those old officers ! And those Fort Davis women ! They 're just rotten bad ! They spend all their time drinking that old booze . And ( here she would lower her voice , but once I heard it anyway , and puzzled over what she said for several years ) they never seem to know whose wife is whose . Why , they exchange wives ! You ca n't tell me anything about them . Why , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will say it myself ( she delivered this as if she were speaking of another person long dead ) , I was pretty . I had the prettiest **26;2346;TOOLONG  --  one of those old officers  --  I never heard what had happened , but I am sure that some injudicious lieutenant must have tried to seduce my mother , God pity him ! Why , she would say , I can hold up my head with anybody , I do n't care who . You just ask your Grandpa  --  or your Papa asfarasaskenserned  --  if I did n't have more beaux than any girl in this town . Any place I went for that matter . And that old Laura Webster  --  that old actress ! Why , she thought she could put one over on me . She would n't introduce me to that fellah from out of town  --  that traveling man when he came into the Bee Hive to see her . Huh ! He was n't suchp108a much . I met him all right , and he asked me to go out with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fingers about him , but I told him I would , just to show that old Laura Webster . When he came out to our house to get me , it was out of our way downtown , but I just guided him past Laura 's house , and as luck would have it , there she was on the porch and I said , Good evening , Laura ! just as sweet as you please  --  and he tipped his hat . She never did a stunt like that again . The old **44;2374;TOOLONG  |p109A  Waxworks photographAFTER many years , the buffet , when it was no longer a smart piece of furniture to anybody , when it was almost as outdated as Poor Yorick , the china closet , gained , as if it had been a decayed gentlewomansuffered to stay as a guest with inferior relatives , a status in the household as a something-or-other , **32;2420;TOOLONG , or **32;2454;TOOLONG .

It was a scene in the diningroom of a set of officer 's quarters at Fort Davis , evidently photographed by an explosion of Victor 's flashlight powder in the long narrow tray with my father 's patent kitchen-match-detonator , for the guests had their eyes in those peculiar attitudes of fixation which indicate that the explosion had momentarily startled and disconcerted them and therefore looked , after the manner of the times , as if they were a cluster of waxworks figures such as one might run into suddenly coming around a corner in Madame Tussaud 's Waxworks in London , and say , My God , I thought they were real . Yet the picture was akin to reality , for you knew that the next moment had become fluid and motion had resumed . Probably the smug androgynous woman , with an almost spatulate nose and the beginning black down of a mustachewho stood smugly in profile in a heavy wool broadcloth dress , high and full , as it was called then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back and bosom , had broken away from her pose at the salad bowl , and , as she was patently the hostess , waved her lace handkerchief and said : Phew ! to her husband .

I must say , I 'm glad that one does n't have to be photographedevery day  --  but then everyday is n't an occasion :  | It must have been an occasion , by the very token that my father was called in with his camera and flashlight powder to record it  --  as he had recorded thousands of other occasions having to do with birth , marriage and death . This then , as I examined it in the forty years ' dust of the negative files , I knew was an occasion  --  almost surely a wedding anniversary of the androgynous woman and her husband , a short lieutenant of cavalry ( the famous Seventh , for on the tight round collar of his old blue semi-dress blouse , there were pinned a brass U. S. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , a brass Troop A below ) . He was , by the silver woven embroidery bars and the cross-shoulder shoulder straps of gilt wire , a first lieutenant ; and his face had a slight leathery texture which was supposed to be typical of the complexion of a cavalryman . The face was trimmed with a thickish **32;2488;TOOLONG mustache which , as is told over and over again by the negatives in my father 's files and all the photographs of the day , lent that solemn-comic sternness to the military countenance  --  a quality of aspect which , even years later , the militaryestablishment , always humorless , could never see as comic . The lieutenant-host was posed over a chafing-dish , bottles of wine , beer and sauces , salt-and-pepper shakers all around him ; and he was staring off into space as if it did n't matter a damn to him , how the sauce or the omelette came out  --  and why the hell could n't that great booby , his father-in-law , who in a checked pearl-buttoned waistcoat , dark jacket , bow-tie and large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoon in hand , as if he were about to spit into it to wet it up a bit , stay the hell away from his daughter and not dress like a bookie ? On the outskirts of this arrested cluster of human festivity , stood the mother-in-law , a smug gross-faced woman in a lace balloon-sleeved dress , a bit of wide blackvelvet ribbon tied around her throat in a big bow at the back , and an expression of thick condescension in her also androgynous features ; beside her , almost out of focus stood another army officer , probably a lieutenant ( though the brass of his rank and branch were partly concealed and dim ) , behind the anonymity of a somewhat porcine face which had blinked at the explosion of the flashlight powder ; beside him werep111two women , one certainly not old , but with a strained dowdy countenance , slim black eyebrows , large ears and a fatuous downwards-lookon a face with dark hair straggling over its forehead that doubtless would have shown a slight body grease shine had the light permitted it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an expression of arrogance as if to say : All this is nonsense . What am I , who am beautiful doing at this poor little party when I have been Belle of the Ball in so many finer places ? The former of these two younger women I took to be the wife of the porcine-faced man  --  the latter may have been his sister or perhaps his wife 's house guest on the post . This record of the gay social life of the army , including one of the dashing officers of the hardest drinking , riding , fighting and f  --  ing regiments of our Lightcavalry Tradition , struck me as mournful , chilly , and bleak from the plates on the table , the unconcealedwaterpipes on the walls of the dining room , to the silver plate trophies displayed on what was obviously a more snobbish relative of Poor Yorick , and the curious combination bootjack and stool on the floor which the truth-telling lens of the camera had picked up to engage my attention years after the party had broken up never to assemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to believe that any of these persons now alive , know that in a darkroomin Fork City , Kansas , there exists a transcript of a moment as they were once . I was thinking in this manner , still staring at the print trying to decide if anything had ever come of the moment at all , when it occurred to me that there was something most familiar to me in the picture ,  --  when it dawned upon me that , much sharper than anything in the photograph and bearing upon its back the two chafing-dishes over which the host and his fatherin-lawwere leaning , stood the buffet which had lived in our diningroomon Third street long ago . It could not have been any other . For there , upon one of the jungle paws which support it , was a scratch I had known for years . Seeing again the seeming of this old ( now ) friend which I had sold down the river at the same sale I had sold Poor Yorick , I forgot that it had been marked with the same condescension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that I had hated its base and baseless snobbery . For it had formed part of the fascinating complexity of things , poor though they were , which had furnished and richened my youth . So for a moment , I began to weep for a thing which was gone , a thing which had hurt me and a thing which I had only known when I lost it , a thing which became an idea that never was , a thing which I had never loved at all . As I stood still in the old dark room where the shelves were lined with Cramer and Hammer dry plate boxes , full of tons of glass and emulsion and silver and bromide images of weddings , anniversaries , family reunions , funerals , parties , horses jumping , men fencing , corpses in caskets wreathed around with floral displays , I thought this picture , with the androgynous , mustachioed women and the solemn hairy officers , resembled a scene from some picture show comedy I had seen , as a child , at the Borealis theatre for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to move , as if on a screen , they would be funny . The sitters in the dark who watched ( though these sitters themselves perhaps were even more comic than those on the screen ) would laugh with a voluptuous feeling of superiority in their entrails and say to themselves : Jesus Chrise , ai n't them guys funny  --  and them old battleaxes with the mustaches tryin ' to ack as if their s  --  wuz crush ' froot . Well , Jesus Chrise ! Haw , haw haw ! And I thought , Goddamn the world for a loose-lipped ape who gibbers and plays the fool , not even knowing that he does it , and makes his creatures so pompous , empty and solemn and evilseeming , that on a stage they would be regarded as a farce that failed , the spectators not even suspecting that they ( the actors ) all had been cast for and in what was intended for a high tragedy . I suppose the androgynous women and the officers , and the old man with the imperial mustache are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe the buffet may survive longer , for it could be sandpapered and a new finish put on it  --  for it was not really an ugly piece of furniture , only dull and undistinguished.  |p113OFF  the dining-hall of this great ancestral seat of mine , of which I was the young duke and heir , there opened the library of the house . That the room was called a library at all was hyperbole  --  the word a euphemism . There were books in it , those etiquette books which had been given by my mother to my father or by my mother 's mother to her and in which appeared , before the titlepageturned up , a presentation page , an illuminated lithographed page with gilt and rubricated initial letters , perhaps with a design of doves carrying roses to and from an ornamental urn suspended from the gigantic P in the word Presented . Of the five or six of these books , which undertook to show not only the etiquettes , the how to do the things of life , but to tell what to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , which were designed especially for book agents to peddle in the provincial market . These made an especial display of the kind of false richness which would appeal to my mother or grandmother as gifts to give away on the occasion of a wedding or an anniversary or Christmas . Two of these were inscribed on the specially bound-in presentationpages : Presentation page one of Social Life , or The Manners and Customs of Polite Society ( Embellished with Colored Photographs ) read , Presented to Mr. Robert L. Harrington by Miss Nora Beckham , Dec. 25 , 1897 ; and its sumptuous stamped and gilded leather back was hidden by a linen cover embroidered with lily pads , sweet peas and the words Social Life in silk ( the long subtitle had been a little too much for Nora 's needle ) . Presentation page two , of The Golden Manual , or The Royal Road to Success , Showing What To Do and How To Do It , read , on the lovebird gilded page : Presented to Nora Beckham by her Mother , Christmas 1895 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richly stamped gilt and vignette covers . The front one showing a medal/lion of a gilt young lady , flying , you might have believed , in Royal Robes , with a flaming torch in one hand and The Golden Manual itself held in the crook of her left arm . You could imagine her stopping for a quick peek at the secrets of her manual when she encountered a heavenly host . Around this coming young lady , whose hair was upborne in the Very Airs of Success , were grouped representations of ladies and gentlemen playing tennis , greeting each other in the street , sitting around the domestic table with their first born  --  and gentlemen plying their business at desks and high stools in the busy mart . Of the guides to social life , The Golden Manual was the one which taught everything , for beginning with an engraving from a Pompeiian wall painting of The School for Vestal Virgins , it ran a veritable gamut including , Rules of Etiquette for All Occasions , Courtship , Marriage and Domestic Life , Business Rules and Instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury of Information . In the matter of marriage , The Golden Manual was particularlyhelpful . Not only did it describe the types of male and female persons best suited for each other , but it set forth pen drawings of persons of different mental and physical attributes to be courted or avoided ; Lieutenant James B. Lockwood , the arctic explorer , was recommended as a very determined man , a fine example of heroic will with resolute action and successful enterprise , while there was only an engraving of two simple fisher-folk lovers entitled Popping the Question between him and an anonymous portrait of a brutal husband with a low forehead , defective intellectual and moral faculties and coarse nature , a drunkard , a creature at the other end of the human scale and to be avoided . If young people followed the instructions in the choosing of a mate in wedlock , they were , without a doubt on the Royal Road to Success . But there was hardly anything that The Golden Manual would not tell you from the date of the Battle of Thermopyla ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Golden Censer ( from the use of the word , one might come to believe that Virtue and Etiquette were not their own rewards ) or The Duties of Today and The Hopes of the Future by James McMasters of The Chicago Intelligencer , was bound inp115full-stamped imitation alligator hide , all its edges were gilt and it too Told Everything , with a special section on bachelorhood . I once , at some time or other , read a few pages the preface of which began thus : I take pleasure in laying before my readers a volume , the aim of which is to lighten the cares of today and heighten the hopes of Tomorrow . Every human aspiration which is not an ignis fatuus or fool 's beacon is built upon the realities of today . A little further on in Mr. McMasters ' book I discovered why he had called it The Golden Censer : Standing at the head of this page were the lines from Edgar Poe 's Raven : Then methought the air grew denser , perfumed from an unseen censerSwung by seraphim whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrote Mr. McMasters , swings in the Temple of Life , making holy its halls and grateful its corridors . This poetic beginning promised much , but I could never go on , perhaps it was because there was an engraving of a mill opposite this beginningcaptioned : The mill will never grind again with water that has past . I could not bear to think of the past water and an idle mill . Social guides were not the only books in the library ; there was a Lives of Illustrious Americans bound in stamped leather , I believe a premium for a subscription to Leslie 's or Collier 's Weekly , a Life of Sitting Bull , another premium , Our War With Spain for Cuba 's Freedom , The Blue and the Gray , Stories and Anecdotes of the Civil War , Our Islands and their People , two heavy folio volumes with photographs of the Philippines and Hawaii , with a preface by and a full page portrait of Major-General Joseph Wheeler , U. S. V. , a reconstructed Confederate , a dingy four volume premium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first few reading years of my life the smallest type I had ever seen , a few odd volumes of E. P. Roe , The Woman Thou Gayest Me , by Hall Caine , Hoyle 's Complete Games , Vendetta by Marie Corelli , the Doctor Book and the family Bible . These books stood neatly behind the glass door of the bookshelfside of a piece of furniture Nora referred to as , my little desk ,  |p116or  , my bookcase . This piece resembled Poor Yorick , the china closet , in wood , design and spirit  --  except for the fact that it was simpler than he , with less scrolls and gingerbread . The whole library , the books of which I have described above , stood behind the glass , on three shelves with the exception of the Bible , the folio and quarto volumes lying on top of the shorter octavo , duodecimo and sextodecimo in a certain order , which was evolved by my mother 's ideas of neatness and the exigencies of the space involved . The top two shelves held the family Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All edges of this were gilt and it had in it full-page engravings of Gustave Dore 's illustrations , atlases of the Holy Land , a pronouncing gazeteer of Biblical names , bits of useful information upon Holy subjects , marginal notes and explanations , a richly gilt , rubricated and initial-lettered section entitled , Family Record , with pictures of babies , doves , the Angels of Birth , Holy Matrimony and Death along with blanks to record the vital events . Indeed , in a first burst of enthusiasm , the marriage of Nora Beckham and Robert Lee Harrington had been recorded and then , in another burst , my birth and weight ( laid in opposite this were four photographs of me , twenty-four hours old , held by , in turn my mother , my maternal grandmother , my maternal grandfather , and my father ) . After this , in one of the futile household attempts at tidiness ( which resemble all abandoned journals and diaries with one or two entries ) there had been recorded the doubtful dates of birth and death of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible had been laid upon the shelf and the silk embroidered cover edged with crocheted rings put over it and an ornamental silver tray set behind it . The shelf above this was full of more of the trinkets of my mother 's life , the chiefest of which was a curved mother-of-pearl catch-all holding another fascinating collection of cuff links , lodge badges , commemorative medals , abandoned collar buttons . Other tenants of the top shelf were old lacework Valentines , rustic match trays from Oregon , a bit of leather on which was burned and painted the face of an Indian maiden . The desk-side , bedecked with scrolls , slanted toward the topp117when closed . When open the face of it made a shelf to write on and revealed a complicated set of pigeon-holes full of my mother 's calling-cards , odd unused but age-yellowed envelopes , more place cards ( used and unused with and without ribbons and little silk tasseled cords ) , stationery in tablets and boxes , Shamrock and Simon Pure Linen ( I always wondered about Simon and why he was pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bound in gold , mother-of-pearl or plain wood or hard rubber , an old Japanesepencilbox my mother had used in school-and a souvenir paperweight of Long Beach , California about 1905 . The paperweight told you that it was a Long Beach souvenir , for the words were printed on the piece of cardboard which was mounted on the underside of the heavy crystal glass . Mounted , in turn on this little round bit of pasteboard , was a small photograph , taken perhaps with an old Rapid Rectilinear lens  --  maybe it was a small Kodak picture  --  entitled , Big Breakers Long Beach , Cal . Standing in the water , their bodies surmounting the water in varied heights , there were to be seen about a dozen bathers . I recall that I used to look through the bullseye-lantern crystal of the paperweight with a magnifying glass ( which also stayed in my mother 's desk ) when she was away from the house , and I was , therefore not likely to be caught and charged with the bitterly punishable crime of rummaging in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great State of California could not have been very old , I thought of it as an object of great antiquity . It was a token of either my mother 's or my Aunt Ellen 's trip to California , which meant trains , with Pullmans and engines and new streets and porches to houses and back fences and woodshedsto see . Shown imprisoned behind the glass of the paperweight , were these men and women . The ladies ' bathing suits had puffed sleeves and long skirts and , from the look of their waists , they must have gone into the water in corsets . Three of them , to one side of the picture , where the immense and long wooden pier started its walk out into the water on round wooden telephone-pole-like piles , even wore large hats sitting level and square upon their heads . The suits of the men had sleeves to the elbow and high necks . The bathers had taken attitudes which , top118me , showed clearly that they were being photographed . Some of the women were standing still timidly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as if they were not sure of the decency of having their picture taken in bathing rigs , while two younger stood brazenly in the foreground , probably giggling , their arms akimbo in a reckless holiday spirit . Perhaps the three older ones felt too that their vanity might not come off so well in a picture record and , therefore , they looked all thumbs . Another woman was carrying something which may have been the waterwings of the day . The men in the background were all farther out , as befitted their vanity and bravado , towards the incoming breakers , the furtherest away from the beach appeared as tall as the high pier upon which idlers looked down at the bathers being photographed . These men in the water were jumping up and down waving their arms , and perhaps thinking that they would make the most spectacular details of the picture . Of the half dozen of these dashing swimmers only one was up to his neck in the water  --  and the three large breakers coming in , shown tiered up in the print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravery involved . The day looked to be fine , and all the times I looked at this record of a seaside moment , I could never hear anything more than a placid boom of the surf . Beyond the incoming breakers there was a sailboat going along calmly enough . Always when I looked at it , it appeared to me to be a pleasant thing , a little musty , these people clamped in a moment under a glass to hold down the papers on my mother 's desk and to act as her little picture paperweight from Long Beach . Maybe the fact that I considered it such an inanimate and arrested and musty moment was enhanced by the dried fern leaves and sea weed which were stuck to the pasteboard on which the photographwas pasted and also imprisoned with the bathers , the noble breakers and the long wooden pier somehow in the moment ( with them ) of the exposure of the negative . The tiny lacelike leaves of the fern and seaweed flattened and dried jutted over the edge of the photograph , with veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree shading the whole tableau of bathers  --  the side and bottom leaves formed a puzzling garland , perhaps wreath-like , suggesting that the whole party wasp119about to be drowned by the incoming inbeating sea , though the souvenir had an aura of dryness not wetness . It was only an effigy of life like an old print of some faraway monument , street or thing in my father 's studio  --  one which he had struck off for his own curiosity from a negative developed for a traveller such as the ones we had which Dr. Torrey had made in Egypt while he was following Amity Prentiss around the world  --  or those taken of dead Moros in the Philippine Islands by soldiers and officers stationed there , with hot , exhausted soldiers standing over ditches and pits of piled-up native carcases , their feet big game hunterwise on the bodies , one hand resting on the stock of the grounded rifles and the campaign hats pushed back on their foreheads  --  the very picture of the nonchalant victor , grinning boy-murderers , ready to be cheered on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not , as I looked at the paperweight , with its representation of a moment long ago at a place which had to be got at by a train in which you had to live three or four days while it was moving , feel as great a strangeness and wonder as I felt when I looked through the lens of my father 's stereoscope at the double picture of say An Alpine Pass , where a short man , in a battered felt hat and a down-drooping dark mustache had paused to have his picture taken on a catwalk . As you brought the lenses up to your eyes , the great beetling rock slid out over your head in air over a long drop of space into which you thought , every time you looked at the picture , you could thrust your arm and wave . For a moment you looked , holding your breath , at the drop below the catwalk , and the air around the beetling rock and the flimsy boards of the catwalk standing out over nothing . Then gradually you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sly , unmountaineerish face , fat and somewhat greasy , the sweat lines on his narrow-brimmed , highcrowned hat , his neat tie , the big flat knot of which made it seem to be one of those ready-tied four-in-hands with short nibs at the knot which were tucked under a slightly dirty celluloid collar , the unfluid wrinkles of his stiff suit ( it had a neutral color in the picture ) which remindedyou of the hills and valleys of a corrugated iron culvert so much that you were sure that he must have leaned his suit in ap120corner when he got out of it . And his shoes : They were patent leather with pointed unfilled toes . The one which he had put up on the rough board railing of the catwalk was scuffed and the upturn at the end and the laces were sharp and easy to see as if you had been standing there on that perch with him . Later , I concluded that this little man , so nonchalant in the grandiose space of the mountain pass , was perhaps the Swiss photographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the near-tumbling cascade of savage rock and air  --  and that the grandeur was not much to him , for he had doubtless been . born in those parts . But another thing which amazed me , was that the camera , when confronted with such a grandeur of drop and space , would bother with the details of cloth , leather , faces , hair and boards down to the smallest most trivial detail  --  things which signified nothing except that the world is full of everything or that one could build with boards and nails upon the remotest mountain rock . In the same way , the pier in the Long Beach Souvenir photographamazed me so much that I used to open my mother 's desk and stare at the paperweight with the magnifying glass for as long as I dared.  |p121Nora  's Dearest PastBELOW the pigeonholed compartment of Nora Beckham 's little desk there was a drawer and a space concealed by a door decorated with oaken gingerbread . In these were housed more of the great Harrington collections consisting of more photographs , souvenirs and commemoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humans , my mother lived not in the present , but the future or the past . When I was a boy , her life was still predominantly in the future ; and I have heard her say : When my ship comes in , Son , we 'll go to those other countries , or , my , if I was a man , I would n't be a stick-in-the-mud , I 'd travel  --  and maybe I will someday , or when we get out of debt , or when your Papa gets the mortgage on the studio paid . These things never seemed to happen , or , when one of them did , it did not appear to be anything which had been looked forward to at all . But the past  --  mostly Nora Beckham 's past  --  lived in the house on Third street . One of the things in the bottom of her little desk was a great folio scrapbook all pasted with the colored lithograph kittens of thread manufacturers , Belding Brothers ' Silks , the lacework pasteboardand ribbon valentines of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and hundreds of little moral pictures of the home life of the Little Ladies of the day . And in this too were Sunday School Lesson Cards and presentation cards from the superintendent of her Sunday School , who had been an aging Civil War veteran with a fastidious liking for pretty curly-haired little girls . Another relic was the carcass of a china-and-stuffing doll which had been a lovely luxury of Nora Beckham 's youth , for the head was handpainted and the hair , a real little wig of human hair with little girl curls and small hair-ribbons . Perhaps the one Tom Beckham had brought to her as she lay dying of a peritonitis in Sedan . Loose inside the drawer and the lower compartment were sewing machine and thread manufacturer 's kittens , even old spoolsp122of rotten thread , relics of when , as a little girl , my mother had learned to sew . There were only a few relics of my father . The mandolin and guitar , which he had used to play at eveningtide on the front porches of the girls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was married when he still paid attention to his clothes and was something of a dandy , had been taken to the studio and allowed to gather dust in the stockroom . The house had grown to be almost entirely my mother 's before the beginning of my memory . True , in this space in the drawer of her little desk , there remained an odd mandolin string or two and a little tortoiseshellpick , with a mother-of-pearl inlay device from the fingerboardof the guitar . But now , I think that these had been left behind there by mistake and had been allowed to stay only because they were not often called to the attention of my mother . When she did see them , which was at rare intervals when she was searching for something else in these caches of her life , that were almost never disturbed , for it seemed to satisfy her curatorship of her life museum to know that they were there , she would say : My , my , I must tell Bob to take his mandolin pick and those old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case where they wo n't be lost . Or , My , my ! there 's that mandolin pick and those old strings again . They are n't of any use to anybody and they just clutter up things , I 've a good mind to throw them away . But her instinct for the protection of property always got the best of her , and these insignificant remnants of my father 's courting bachelorhood , when there had been music at nightfall and fine clothes and young girls ' silly laughter , remained to clutter up the past of Nora Beckham until she was dead and until her little desk was sold to a second-hand man , perhaps Mr. Keitel 's successor , who said with a brusque sadness which was foreign to Fork City and had nothing of Mr. Keitel 's artistry in it , that he did n't know what he could do with sich a piece of furniture , fer people was n't a-buyin ' sich things now and you could n't hardly figger on nothin ' . Above the desk compartment of the desk was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate with a picture in color of the Philadelphia City Hall baked into it , a photograph , in an ornamental ironwork frame posed on elegant reed andp123lathework studio furniture in my father 's studio , of his two sisters playing parchesi or some like board and dicebox game , another conch shell , a bust photograph of my mother with her naked shoulders floating coyly in the tulle and artificial roses which my father kept in the dust of the dresser drawer in the dressing-room at the gallery . The desk-bookcase should have been the most important piece in a room called the library , but I have long doubted that this was true . It was not true for me , anyway , for I seldom troubled the books in the bookcase , because of my craven fear of the wrath of my mother , who disliked to have her past disarranged . The preservedpast was that dear to her that , when she got and acquired what appealed to her eye as something particularly pretty , she immediately put it away somewhere , behind the glass of Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if stowage space in these places did not seem secure or suit her fancy for the entombment , she would tuck it away in a drawer where it would never be seen . Therefore , I stood in some terror of disturbing the books  --  and , to tell the truth , it was a long time before any but the Civil War book and the one about the Philippines interested me much at all . Therefore , I believe , that what my mother used to call her Sanitary Couch , was to me the most important piece of furniture in the room . Extended prone upon this couch , I used to spend many hours , looking at and reading the funny papers  --  the Comic Section of the Philadelphia Press , the Sunday edition of which my Great Uncle Joseph Beckham used to pack up in a fat , rich brownpaperedroll each week and send to my Grandfather Beckham . Every detail of this weekly package from Uncle Joe in Philadelphia used to excite my faculty for anticipation to as great a degree , I believe now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every week , a long brown cylinder flattened , with several vigorously cancelled stamps , a Manayunk Station postmark and Uncle Joe 's flourishing , long essed penmanship with a big ornamental M. on the Mr. Thomas Beckham , Jr . The ends of this sumptuous weekly gift , where the rolls of newspaper were naked , showed the colored folds of Little Nemo , Happy Hooligan and , most exciting of all , Hair- breadth Harry and The Relentless Rudolph . My Grandfather Beckhamand I both called him Hairbrea'th Harry  --  and I wondered for some years , for I was afraid to admit my unsophistication , how a man 's breath could be like hair . Even now when I think quickly of Hairbreadth Harry , I have a separate vagrant thought of a man who has drunk the **28;2522;TOOLONG and therefore has true hair breath . Though I had often , before I could read and therefore was having the funny papers read to me , heard my mother say such things as : Why Bob , that old meat cart did n't come a hair 's breadth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escapes with the comic section hero . I hoarded each comic section of The Philadelphia Press then and kept them on the two bottom shelves of a dark varnished oak magazine rack . ( The top shelves were filled with old Literary Digests , Collier 's , Butterick Fashion Plates , Metropolitans ) and when I could , I stretched upon the couch and read Hairbreadth Harry , in my head composing variations on the sawmill-railroad track melodrama in the perpetual hair 's breadth rescue of the Beautiful Belinda . She was a rather badly drawn blonde , whom I regarded as only a pawn in the game of complex things to create sudden death . She was hardly more than a ball to be kept out of the goal your team was defending . The central piece , geographically speaking , of the library , however , was the library table . It was of the same dark varnished oak finish , with a leafy conventional design carved on its legs which ended in the same sort of jungle claws that Poor Yorick and the others had . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanently stored two picture books , one of Charles Dana Gibson 's Girls and one of Harrison Fisher 's Girls , a copy of Caricature or the Wit and Humor of a Nation in Picture Song and Story Illustrated by America 's Best Artists . On top of the library table in its middle stood a library lamp on a metal standard shaped somewhat like a shepherd 's crook lopped off at the bottom and thrust into a heavy metal base ( of the same distempered tortoise shell brass as the door bell ) . Hung upon the crook was a truncated cone of green glass in which was one of the old looped filament carbon bulbs . This gave off , despite the green shade , a sort of obscene yellow homelike light which I imagined to be snug andp125protective though tired in quality . This yellow carbon light , I have often seen as if in a timeless fantasy , as the village light of America . Shining from millions of doors ( like ours with the harpwomanon it ) , mellow , weary with the heat and cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the greenflies as well as the soft falling snow of old obscure winter nights . Carbonlight , though now the old filaments which carry the flame have gone , still broods over the small towns at night as the wick and oil , the candle and the gasmantle must have brooded years ago beyond their time into memory . In my fantasy it always seemed to me that I was trying to struggle out of the little yellow pools of light in the hot summertime village streets  --  as if I had been caught , as a fly is caught in the sap which is to become amber not even of the first grade and to be sold centuries later as ornament for those who never knew and could not heed what I had been nor understand my purposes  --  and that all this heedlessness and ununderstandingwas varnished over with a monstrous indifference to everything , including itself . There were chairs in the library , but now I can not recall that any member of the family ever sat long in any one of them . One was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat which was supposed to conform to the sitting angles and curves of the human body and also to please the eye in the matter of beauty . The bent veneered oak of the seat of this and the back creaked and popped with the action of dried glues and disuse , when anybody , through a mistake or because he was a guest in the house , sat in it . There was also another and more ponderous dark varnished oak ( this I believe was solid ) rocking chair , which was beginning to check from the heat of summer and the bronzed hotwater radiator which heated the room in winter . When my mother answered a letter , which was rarely , as I remember it , she would borrow one of the six dark veneered oak chairs from the dining-room , which , I forgot to mention , filled the spaces around the wall not occupied by Poor Yorick , the buffet or the serving-table . This borrowing was no trouble , for she got few letters to answer . Her only other correspondence was with mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she bought some of her clothes on the installment plan , a furniturep126company from which she later got a wardrobe or two , Dawkin and Company , the premium people , and that mysterious and forbiddingplace in Knoxville , Tennessee , where she had sent for the tobacco , which was connected in my mind with a trip on the train which I never took . Anyway , she would say , I 'm just no hand to write at all . It 's just like Cousin Hettie , or Uncle Joe , my father 's brother , back in Philadelphia , used to say : Nora you jist are n't any good to write at all . And my , my , I just guess I 'm not . As the fellah says , they just hit the nail on the head , all right . This small room , one door of which opened into the hall where the harpwoman stood guard at the portal , was the center of the learning and the culture of the house and was darkened by some sort of velvetish drapes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lace curtains . I remember , in the years of my adolescence , when on rainy fall days I would sit or lie on the couch looking out into a grim leafless street ( paved then , the asphalt looking much blacker than the loblolly or gumbo which used to appear there ) , as I was reading a gray passage of Hawthorne or one of the Russian novelists ( checked out of the public library ) I would feel that life was the most dreary and tasteless condition possible , and begin to ponder as I had done as a child , indeed as I suppose all children must have done on the word , eternity  --  and where did space end and what was outside of space and if there were a God , as the Reverend Mr. Horseley had said at the church , where often I had been dragged unwilling and ashamed by my mother , who made Him and in turn who made the man or God or whatever-it-waswho made Him who made Him who made Him But , as I discovered later , this sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lefthanded , knives-in-the-back which Life , Society , Conditions , The Public deal out as little jokes and justices along the way . The library , at home , however , was more dark than light , and I can remember that , as a child , I was sometimes afraid of its darkness on the way upstairs to bed  --  and this , I think , was not wholly attributable to my bouts with such as The Cask of Amontillado and The Masque of the Red Death , which also I had got from the public library . My mother was always quick to detect the symptoms of this fear and to speak to me saying : Oh son , I wish you would n't read those horrible old booksp127by that Poe fellah . They do n't amount to a hilla beans . You know it scares you . And do n't you put your head down that way and sulk . I just do n't know why , with all the grief and foolishness in the world , they write those old books anyway . You 're just bullheaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on up to bed and do n't soldier around on the way . Nothing 's going to hurt you ! My oh my , I just ca n't understand why you read those old kind of books . All this would come from her in the utmost sincerity of the moment , though she once confessed a taste for the shockers of Marie Correluh ( and thought it genteel to pronounce a final i as uh ) , and one day when I had nothing to read and was worrying her at her work in the kitchen or at some household task or keepingher from an especial stretch of brooding , a luxury to which she occasionally sentenced herself , she recommended Vendetta ! to me , dwelling upon its horrible bloody scariness and conveying to me by clicks of the tongue and Oh my 's how she had wallowed with delight in the horror and spilt blood . Oh my , Son , I 've read a lot of books in my day , I just tell you but Vendetta ! is just one of the worst I ever read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those old Eyetalian people swear out a vendetta of revenge against one another . But it 's exciting . I remember your Grandpa Beckham saw me reading it one day , and he said you just leave it to those Eyetalians  --  they write a boss blood-andthunderstory ! Bully ! Not that day but later , I got my mother to take Vendetta ! , a cheap but elegant reprint , from the bookcase side of her desk . I read it : It was bloody and frightening enough for me . Even the preface , prefaces were things which when encountered I had **25;2552;TOOLONG thought dull , I read in several rich gulps . " Lest those who read the following pages should deem this story at all improbable , it is perhaps necessary to say that its chief incidentsare founded on actual occurrences which took place in Naples during the last scathing visitation of the cholera in 1884 ... " The very date and signature at the end of it : August , 1886 , Marie Corelli , seemed a blinding miracle , for even , say , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , 1886 might just as well have been the date of some ancient dynasty of Egypt.  |p128And  rats and the Plague in Naples ! When my eyes hit the beginning of chapter one , I was off on a holiday of horror better than any drunk , any roisterer ever had : " I who write this , am a dead man . Dead legally  --  dead by absolute proofs  --  dead and buried ! Ask for me in my native city and they will tell you I was one of the victims of the cholera that ravaged Naples in 1884 , and that my mortal remains lie moldering in the funeral vault of my ancestors . Yet  --  I live ! I feel the warm blood coursing through my veins  --  the blood of thirty summers  --  the prime of early manhood invigorates me , and makes these eyes of mine keen and bright  --  these muscles strong as iron  --  this hand powerful of grip  --  this wellknitform erect and proud of bearing .

My hair , once ebony-black , is white as a wreath of Alpine snow , though its clustering curls are as thick as ever . " On I went into the life , loves and times of Fabio Romani , into them and through them struggling out of the coffin in the family tomb after watching the frantic revels-before-death in well-known cafes , the brethren of the house of the Misericordia and all the dark sweetly dank trappings of death , until at last the hand of the unfaithful wife flops from beneath the stone in the tomb of the Romanis  --  and the Vendetta Fabio swore is complete and discharged . Even now , even a middle class cemetery with no great mausoleums of Carrara marble and all the stone gingerbread of death , will take me back to the house on Third street in the library , and I will see Fabio Romani breaking from the coffin in the mausoleum of his ancestors at Naples and his circle completed when the stone from the ceiling falls on his faithless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alpine snow , to flap a final flop in the death of the unfaithful . Thus , though it was poor and did not furnish the sumptuously bound , richly gilt , crested , calf and morocco volumes with silk doublures of all the curious and standard works and all the things a young duke ought to know , the library of my Fork City seat was not a total loss for it held out and opened up a discord of curious emotions and intelligences.  |p129MY  MOTHER 'S front parlor opened off the front hall opposite the library  --  you came in through the harpwoman door and turned to your right through , at the time of my earliest memory of it , a set of rope portieres of brown velvet rope , which hung down like some debased form of Spanish moss and gave the hallway an atmosphere which seemed to me to smack of The Castle of Otranto in a hot dusty sort of way . But everything , in the time of the first blush of furnishing of the house on Third street , seemed hot and dusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . When you brushed through this rope moss , its nap polishing your face in a sudden warm furriness , as if you had been caressed by the trappings of a Victorian undertaker , you came into the front parlor . Now here , indeed , was the museum of the house , the place where the Sundaybest things were kept in a kind of sad funereal aura of half-death . And , to give the Devil his due , Nora Beckham had not as fully developed a parlor-museum illness as most smalltown housewives . For my father and I were not entirelyforbidden the parlor , except on state occasions when companycame to the house and sat upon the edges of Nora 's rockers , as most of the men of the town  --  of all small towns  --  were forbiddentheir women 's parlors . We could go into it , even sit there on a chair-edge , but , I think , even a sexton , a caretaker of a cemetery does not find comfort sitting in a tomb . What struck the eye first was the baywindow opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fern which grew from an earthen pot about a foot in diameter and about fourteen inches high . This earthen pot was concealed in a dark green , beflowered jardiniere . Both stood on a dark oak varnished pedestal , a thing with a round top and bottom between which was a fluted tapered column about three feet high . The round base was in the middle of the floor of the bay window and , spraying out from the pot ,  | were the long green stems and fronds of the fern touching the lace curtains of the three windows , the plain panes of which were bordered with alternate green and blue stained glass squares about five or six inches in diameter . The fern stood like a tyrant , four feet or more in diameter , on his oriel throne , taking up the lightest place in the room and causing the blinds to be drawn on hot days so that the sun could do it no harm . The fern killed many hours of my mother 's life . Some days no one but she entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-dark hush of the room , in the sunlight shafts which could not be kept out , for no window blind was ever sun-tight , unwelcomedustmotes visibly rose from the flowerwreathed Axminstercarpet . With the exception of Nora Beckham 's daily wateringand perhaps finger-pruning of the fern these dustmotes were the only motion which the front parlor saw for days on end . Around the house , in the older chafing-dish which sat upon Poor Yorick , in the top of the kitchen cabinet with the shot-fromcannonbreakfast food , in the pigeon-holes of her little desk and perhaps in other small caches in other unobtrusive places of stowage , my mother had secreted a convocation of packages of plant tonic , plant food , fern dinner , plant panacea , with which at one time or another she had dosed her fern . She tried everything for its good health , though it always seemed to me to be a most healthy fern . I thought it most robust . Once , however , the idea came to me that because of the continual dosing she gave it , she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on bone meal and fern food and talked over its health with Auntie Carper and Mrs. Funk and everybody who had one of these octopi of plant life . My mother allowed each of these proud Little Sisters of the Fern to prescribe for her creature of the bay window  --  but I , in my obtuse-minded way , took it for granted that our house was the only one in Fork City which housed such a baywindow-grabbing monster , when in reality they were as common , I later found out , as aspidistras in Oxford diggings . One day , I read a story , in a book I had drawn from the public library , about a fight with an octopus . It was illustrated with ap131portrait of the monster who was girded up in such a waving forest ( the artist had thrown in a dozen or so over the eight ) of tentacles , that I immediately thought of my mother 's fern in the front parlor . So , from that time on , I called the fern The Octopus ( in my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night as I went through the five candlepower carbon light of the hallway past the door to the front parlor on my way upstairs to bed . I began to make dark terrible fantasies before I went to sleep , in which my mother was the queen of a cult of devilfish worshippers . Many a night I have seen The Octopus of the bay window , below me in the very same house , waving its tentacles in the plushvelvet darknessof my mother 's front parlor . Once I heard one of the ancient females of Fork City , one of the old aunties , talking to my mother about what to do for their ferns ' health . I saw the old woman 's jaw wag and the bewhiskered mole upon it rise and fall : You know , Nora , all my born days I wondered what Will Schmutz done to that fern of his down to the undertaker 's parlor and I was down there the other day and I said to him : Lookee here , Will Schmutz , I knowed you ever since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' I want you to tell me what you do to that fern of yours to make it so green an ' purty . Well , he says , Auntie Carper ( it must have been Auntie Carper ) , I do n't mind telling you . You know ever once in a while we git- - Auntie Carper 's mole whiskers stopped wagging , and she looked at me with her wrinkled-up look and dark little fierce bullying old woman 's eyes . Ah ! Ah ! Nora , honey  --  little pitchers have big ears . Then the old witch who lived inside the woman who sometimes gave me cookies screeched out in a sort of Hecate 's hawhaw-heehee . Now , Lover , my mother said , you go out and play , Mamma and Auntie Carper want to talk . I got out with my dignity dragging , the filed-glass laughter of Auntie Carper followingme into the backyard . I pondered the story of Will Schmutz 's fern for a while at the time  --  and the puzzlement of it would return to me for years at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . I could n't be sure . Then one hot afternoon in Los Angeles , an advertising sales/man told me : We were passing a mortuary called a Wee Shrine of the Flowers and Ferns . Jesus , he said , look at those Goddamn ' plants  --  takes me back to when I use ' to work for one of those vultures . Look at that green ! You know how they do it , do n't you ? You do n't ? Think man , think . They embalm the stiffs  --  pickle ' em like the Goddamn ' ancient effing Egyptians ! They got ta pump the blood outa the bastards . Well , what do they do with it ? Jesus , what fertilizer ! I was back again in the kitchen , listening to the truncated conversation between my mother and the old Hecatefaced Auntie Carper . The very words were there on the warm dead afternoon of Fork City air : Ah ! Ah ! Nora , honey  --  little pitchers have big ears . Of course ! Sure ! Why had n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that sandy waste of a desert city , where the mortuaries and funeral homes elbow each other in an obscene grab for the dead who come to die there , I thought that maybe the fern in my mother 's front parlor had had her blood and my blood and the blood of thousands of people who lived in such thrice Goddamnedjungleless jungles as Fork City , Kansas  --  and so help me Christ and a crown of bloody thorns my octopi-fantasies had been a true statement of an old sore situation . For here I was no better off than I had been in the Kansas heat and ice . Nothing gained but years on my back which the sooner would bring me to fertilizinga fern around the ornamental phony-gothic of a Wee Shrine of Flowers and Ferns . Seeing , I suppose , the look of horror and despair on my face , the advertising salesman , who was not a success then , and a kind and tolerant man , said gently : Fer Chrise sake , pal , do n't take it so hard . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  even a poor sonofabitchof an undertaker . The fern in the front parlor was one of the true horrors of childhood , for in my braver moments , I used to dodge under the leaves to examine closely the little starfishlike stampings on the little panes of colored glass . This , of course , I always did on the sunniest days , for any suggestion of darkness in the parlor , after my fantasy about the devilfish , for a long time made my tenancy of the room almost insupportable . I did , however , on sunny daysp133find the little panes of glass interesting to look at . Once I found ants crawling in the little crevices of the glass pattern and followed their columns to the earth in the fern pot where they had begun to lug away the bone meal or fern food my mother must have put on the earth in the pot that morning . I believe that it was this time that Nora Beckham came to the door and stood for a moment among the rope portieres , perhapscontemplating for a moment the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shade of her mostprized parlor possession . My presence came to her gradually and she said : Son ! I thought you were somewhere ! You come right out from under my fern . Come out of my bay window . Mama wants you to distinklyunderstand that she does n't want you under her fern . And what are you doing under there anyway  --  the one place in the house your Mamma told you never to go ? Why are you so naughty ? I came out from under the fern , brushing its leaves with my head , which was , my mother thought , held down in the semblance of a sulk . It had been on the tip of my tongue to say excitedly , Oh ! Mamma ! There 's some ants  --  a long string of ' em . But my head shook some leaves from one of the fern stems to the floor  --  and my mother , who was perhaps preoccupied with something which vexed her , or was having one of her sick headaches , or indeed it may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face hard with her open hand . It stung my face and jolted my head , but , most of all , it hurt my dignity . Why are you so bullheaded ? I 'll teach you to mind me . You 're just like that Harrington outfit  --  all of them bullheaded and shiftless . For the life of me I ca n't understand what you were doing soldiering around in my parlor for  --  under my fern . Son , I just do n't know , you 'll drive me insane someday . She grabbed me by the lobe of the ear and said , Now march ! When we had stopped in the kitchen , she was panting a little , and I thought , even then , with her face set into the straight mouth and frown lines of anger , that she was pretty . I did not understand what I had done to anger her anyway , nor why she was so unreasonablyunpleasant to me . I had no clear idea what the bull- headedness and shiftlessness of the Harrington outfit were  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapping and bullying my dignity out of me , I resented being compared to the Harrington side of the family because she had convinced me that my father 's family was inferior to hers and not good for anything by her constant thoughtless nagging against them . And yet these outbursts against the Harringtons would seem illogical when she , in a different mood , would be talking to a Mrs. Funk or a Mr. Nointestines or a Cousin Amy and extoll the virtues of the Harringtonfamily , saying perhaps : Oh yes , my sister-in-law is quite artistic  --  quite accomplished . She went to college . Why she 's taught school a good many years and she 's just a good hard worker . Mr. Harrington 's family all have the most pleasing easy-going personalities . They came from the South , you know . Yes , they have the most pleasing personalities . Once , in an ill-advised mood of childlike logic , I said in the middle of one of these paeans of praise of the Harringtons to cousin Amy : Why , Mamma , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now son , my mother said , her lips shutting down and the straight frown lines coming between her eyes , you misunderstood Mamma . But Mamma , you said  --  You know I never said any such a thing . Cousin Amy , the child just ca n't remember what I did say . Why , I only said that they could 've been bullheaded and shiftless  --  so many of those old Southerners are  --  but not Bob 's family . She went on with a cascade of words which I can not remember  --  but Cousin Amy and I were both drowned . The fern was , in those days , the main piece of the front parlor . There were more veneered oak rockers spool-lathework spokes to lean against , a little stool with a black cutvelvet top , and a two and a half by five foot mirror framed in a wide black solid oak frame . This hung in a corner next to the backparlor , on the same side of the room as the fern  --  and my mother referred to it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front parlor  --  or upon occasion , if she were , say , in a furniture store or the home of a friend she wished to impress , my elegunt big mirror . When one of the Negroesmy father always had around was cleaning house , she wouldp135say : When you clean my big mirror I want you to be careful and not get Gold Dust on the frame  --  and Gnat , or Bill , or Wes , do n't dare jiggle it too much it might come down and break . This mirror I was almost afraid to look into for fear it would break . And because of some strange association in my mind it seemed to me , perhaps because of its reflecting depths , that when I looked into it I was in some marble-hailed institutional palace such as the one depicted by a scene painter named Grabark , on the curtain of the Fork City Opera House  --  a cold , slippery and most uninviting hallway with nothing to recommend it but an ornamentalRoman helmet , sword and stand of arms , a small forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some careless legionary of Julius Caesar 's . Underneath this mirror stood a light colored varnished wood taboret , with a dog 's head done on its top in elegant pyrography by my father 's sister , Aunt Cornelia . There was a double doorway to the back parlor , only an arch a little more than the size of two doors outlined in the varnishedyellow pine woodwork of the house . At one time it may have had wooden doors in it which could be closed , but I rememberonly a series of rope portieres , velvet drapes and then an oak framework about a foot deep which was screwed under the lintel with hundreds of abacus-like though immovable spools in it . This was bought , of a piece , at a local furniture store and screwed up in a moment , remaining for many years to catch the dust and to be swiped over by the unending Negroes standing on chairs and ladders . In the back parlor there was a Victorian loveseat of a lowgradewith cutvelvet upholstery , a chair to match it which I later learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Victorian Hamlets used for the Prince of Denmark 's famous soliloquy  --  and another rocking-chair . This rocking-chair was known to my mother as **57;2579;TOOLONG . It too was dark varnished oak ( solid not veneered ) and the back , which was oval in shape , two inches thick , bent inward toward the arms , to clutch the back of the sitter . It was seldom anybody ever sat in it , for the surface where the back of the sitter would rest was carved with ap136has relief of an old bespectacled cellist , a character study in wood , which was typical of the character studies of the day , and which would leave a painful intaglio of the old cellist on a sitter 's back . It was , however , in the category which my mother called her good furniture or any of her things which were to be used for good or kept for good . It was seldom sat in  --  in truth it was seldom admired , for the parlors themselves were only used for good . This back parlor had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a combination player and hand operated instrumentwhich could conceal its pedals . For years this piano was king of the back parlor . Nora Beckham dusted and had the Negroes dust it and cared for it and referred to it as , my player-piano . I was taught to regard it as unique , for it was one of those combination devices which did two things . It could be ( unlike Hamlet ) played upon  --  or it would play itself . I have always wondered why this piano was never graduated to the front parlor , for it was , doubtless , one of my mother 's treasures  --  one which I have heard her mention many times to the women of Fork City casually , but as if she were using a club over their heads . My , my , I did n't know you had a piano . I have a player myself  --  but you can play it both ways . It 's a combination . It 's simply wonderful . Mr. Harrington  --  and if I do say it myself  --  Bob , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegunt . The looks , feeble expressions of attempted haughtiness , of foiled braggadocio , of crushed humbleness which formed on the faces of the rival housewives always made me slightly uncomfortable as a boy  --  though I had often heard my mother say , as the fellah said , if you do n't blow your own horn , nobody 'll blow it for you . Years later , it occurred to me that she had made a mistake in the instrument  --  she had blown her own piano . The thing did blow . There was a bellows inside of it , which worked in connection with small bellows connected by rubber tubes to the keys . When you put a long spool of paper cut with the oblong holes of , say , Sousa 's The American Patrol march and allowed the holes in the paper to pass over the holes in a wooden slotboard , the big bellows sucked at the little bellows on the keys and the whole combination of rubber tubing respired into a wheezyp137military march , which finally gained speed until it was martial enough that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete with those tunics which were worn with one sleeve flying to the wind in honor of the colonel who got out somebody 's bedroom window halfdressed but alive . I used to pump at this thing before my feet would reach the pedals properly . It may have been that Nora Beckham 's player piano was the reason I escaped the drudgery of taking music lessons . Now , before we move upwards into the upper chambers and galleries of the great seat of the young duke of Fork City , there was a splendid fabric built backwards off the house on Third street as an afterthought of the older peer , Lee said tenderly . This fabric consisted in The Little Bathroom , The Back Downstairs Bedroom and The Store Room . The Little Bathroom was surely the most important to me , for it contained that noble engine , which , an Englishman , one Sir John Harrington ( perhaps one of my own ancestors ) cribbed from the Romans and other Ancients , the water closet . Here , with the help of a piece of plumbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as richly embellished as the distinguished knight 's , I may be said to have begun my education . For here it was that I spent many long quiet hours staring at the pictures in mailorder house catalogs , reading the descriptions of the toys in Sutler Brothers ' Our Traveller , a huge book of toys , fireworks and almost everything which my Grandfather Beckham could send for from their warehouse on Locust street in St. Louis , Missouri . Later I saw this smoke-blacked stone pile , which still had high desks with sharp desk spindles for filing papers and high stools which must have held the slick serge covered buttocks of poor anonymous clerks and book-keepers for years . When I saw it the desks were vacant and the building was having some modern surgery done to its inwards . It was an unpleasant dark monument to percentages in a dreary wholesale district  --  but I almost rushed into it , thinking I would say to one of the Brothers Sutler perhaps : I know you ! I know your catalog . For years in a Fork City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house on Third street , Our Traveller gave me many 's the pleasant hour . And I used to get electric trains and roller coasters for Christmas from Sutler Brothers . But just as , in a dreamlike loneliness , I was about to go in the door , out came a young man much like myself but a little older , a little less well-dressed , a little shabbier . His face was , if possible , more pallid of color and sourer of expression than mine and one of the lapels of his dark blue double-breasted velvetcollaredovercoat was torn a little . It was windy in the street and chilly with the uncomfortable feel of a day between dead fall and embalmed winter  --  and an eternal piece of wrappingpaper was scraping , in a patter of dust over the brick of the paving . He turned from the door , grabbed the brim of a sooty gray hat and plunged forward , leaning at me , almost ran into me , glared a glare of disgust without begging my pardon and went down the humanless and inhuman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those hydraulic stops , clucked softly shut , without even slamming behind him  --  for he was already ten yards away . I stood looking at the sooty stone , the empty rooms and the massive outdated masonry and shivered , thinking of the comfortabletimes in Third street when I was just beginning my education . There in the little bathroom , I began my education . For my Grandfather gave me my own copy of Under Both Flags , A Panorama of the Great Civil War , as Represented in Story , Anecdote , Adventure , and the Romance of Reality written by Celebrities of Both Sides : the Men and Women Who Created the Greatest Epoch of Our Nation 's History , Gorgeously Illustrated . On the front cover of this story of the Great Civil War stood a Damyankee and a Rebel clasping hands after It was all overforty-oddyears ago , as my Grandfather Beckham would say . It was a great book , and I , the young duke , would sit upon his throne , under a flowing spring , over a pleasant water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' knapsacks on the blue cloth covers . It was full of everything from A Boy at Shiloh to Reminiscencesof the Sanitary Commission with a photographic portrait of the meek sad lady who wrote the little stories about caring forp139the wounded . It had horrible and eye-opening pictures of such things as the dead in the Bloody Lane at Antietam , often when my eyes , devouring every detail such as an abandoned drum , a musket , a cannonball , a set of buttons for a long daydreaming while , in the middle of which sometimes my mother would call me , would forget everything until they were jerked from the focus of the page by her voice . And then , making my obeisance to Cloacina with her particular prayerpapers , I would pull up , button my trousers and try to rise with : Son , you hurry ! I thought Mamma told you not to stay all day in that old place , ringing in my ears , to find that my legs had lost their circulation and gone to sleep from sitting so long at court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathtub , in which I did once play a Knight of the Bath , a washbowl , a mirror , a medicine cabinet and all the emoluments which I suppose , even at that date , many dukedoms did not know . The throne , however , was to me the greatest comfort , easement and gentlemanly fixture of all  --  though I loved to bathe  --  and I think on it now as the greatest ally of education and learning in our so-called civilized world.  |p140But  now I tell you . I have a fear of houses and all the impedimentathereof . For they are the memento mori , the little brothers and sisters of death . Such an innocent object as a copy of Alfred Edward Housman 's A Shropshire Lad lying on a bedside table may make a man 's heart freeze and his spine flow out of him like water through a funnel . Indeed , the chair he sat in last year may today , in his mind , resemble an iron virgin of the torture chamber  --  for was it not there he sat when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drink or came to the final thought that in the most horrible future , there was nothing now to do except to live from day to day with nothing to look forward to except to get up in the morning and pull on the shoes , tie the laces , button the shirt and flip the four-in-hand and even  --  if the shoes and shirt and tie were new and fine each day  --  the thought was there to prevent hope . There would be nothing now except the sameness of the weedy world  --  and Eden would be reversed . Abraham Lincoln was reputed to have said once that there was a time in his life when he dared not carry a pocketknife , so gloomy was the life his eyes looked out and in upon . So it was once with me , but I could only go to bed at night wishing that I would not wake in the morning . And it is so with me now . Now I drink , but I can not face drink because of what has passed in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , running to seed . Tomorrow ? Who wakes to tomorrow with joy ? Not I. Tomorrow means another collection of the magpie 's freight , experience . No . Not even that . For the magpie 's freight is bright . And experience lies like a pile of dried manure on the stones of a dungeon , dropped through fright and dried through boredom as the bloody clock ticked its bones and mine away to dust . The house on Third street in Fork City , though there was a time I loved it despite its brute ugliness , I can not even abide to think of now . Poor Yorick , the fern , the plate rail , the newelpost , the staircase and the varnish shining on the hard yellow pinep141stairs in the little hylo globelight which was always turned down dim at night , these used to be things of mystery and fascination . But now they are naked horrors like the emergency rooms of a thousand hospitals or the drunk tanks of a thousand jails or the slabs of a thousand morgues . I fear houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the daily obscenity of life . I can not pass a wall , a book , a picture as I listen to the clock grinding away like the mills of death , without wishing to turn and run down the world  --  down the corridors of death to get away from the books , the wallpaper , the pictures , the pens , the uniforms , the swords , the walls , the socksandshoes and the Goddamned morning paper with its calendar-facestaring up at you , handing you the same jottings from the great abattoir every day , day-in-day-out , Smith Dies After Long Coma : Love Nest Revealed : Live Half Century in Boudoir of Death : Doakes Draws Drunk Driving Rap .

And here and now , Lee said , his voice sententious with the ale  --  or even now and then , or now and now , or then and then , it 's of little moment  --  you and I sit somewhere in the lap of eternity or nowhere . We are a duration , a continued existence  --  or perhaps we are something like a little circle , a line with its tail in its mouth revolving around death , the empty house . Why , so help me God , Lee said , I see Smalley now sitting in the yellow light of the forty candlepower carbonbulb . The momentis so frozen , so static in all empty eternity in my memory that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Edison Mazda globe which hung down from the ceiling of the back bedroom . I can see him now , Smalley , he sat there as I lay dying of diphtheria with the membrane in my throat tightening itself up like a drumhead readying up to roll me off into a different part of space  --  a dry run of death . Well , he was the young doctor then . He had a stiff collar and some brindle whiskers and a quiet dry voice like the pleasant sound of leaves blowing gently in an Autumn sky . He had n't exactly a bedside manner , though he was beginning to develop the patriarchal air which sits on the shoulders of all smalltown Geepees . That was long before he began to talk of his youth and how many were dead around the county  --  and how the old names were gone from the old houses . He was then my only contact with time or eternity and that was so light that I felt nothing , for I was still in the earliest reaches of memory which stretched backwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisle of table legs , baseboards , thep143flowery patterns of Brussels carpets and the clawed glass-ballclutchingfeet of my mother 's good furniture . I was still coming out of the anesthetic of birth . I was like a fuddled drunk returning to sobriety . And there Smalley sat , his unpigmented eyes blinking in the light , that travelled up from Mr. Hogarty 's dynamos in the mill on the river , The Doctor . Perhaps he was the first symbol of eternity I ever knew , for Colonel-Doctor Gaines , who had pulled me unwillingly into this great aberration around us , I did not remember . And , I presume , that Zachary William Gaines , Medicinae Doctor , the man who conspired with the Swiss , to shove me onto this shute-the-shutes with the millions of other poor gibbering idiots , had got himself out of my mother 's favor for some dim superstitious reason . Perhaps it was said that he , like thousands of other country sawbones , had noticed after he had sewn up the corpse-to-be that he was short a pair of forceps or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , that fits . Nora would have set her lips and tilted her head from side to side saying , perhaps with an air of mystery : Myohmy , that old Doc Gaines ! He just has n't any principle . Why ! I would n't let him treat a dog of mine . So she had said to my father : Bob , I just do n't like what I heard about that old Doc Gaines . We 'll just call another doctor  --  Doctor Smalley . Smalley came and , with a teaspoon clamping down my tongue , looked down my throat . When he got into the other room he must have said : Well , Bob , there 's a membrane there all right . He 's got a patch . We 'll have to put him to bed and get some antitoxin into him . Diphtheria ? my father said . I do n't like that antitoxeen . From horses , ai n't it ? Now , Bob , Smalley said , it 's new but it 's been tried and it may help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I just do n't like that old horse blood business . I want it distinkly understood I just do n't think I want you shooting that old stuff into Lee . Bob , we do n't want anything to happen . Well , Smalley said , his face turning into a graypink Hippocraticmask , it 's yours and Bob 's privilege  --  he let the sentence hang in the air and , taking a fresh grip on eternity , brought up some words of realization through the germladen air . It was asp144if a diphtheritic membrane of silence had closed the house on Third street to all except death and time . It seemed as if all in the house were struggling under a fallen tent of tough thin mucilaginous translucent and murderous stuff . Well , Dick , my father said : the idy is , I do n't know anything about thisNo , Nora said , I just do n't know anything about that old antitoxeeneither . It 's just an awful risk . Well now , Mrs. Harrington , if it 'll make you feel any easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consult . Well I du n no , Doc , my father said . Now you look here , Bob Harrington , Nora said , I think Dr. Smalley 's absolutely right . I think we 'd better have him call Dr. Torrey . All right . Fine , Dr. Smalley said . The passage of time did not worry me at all , for I had not heard of the Swiss fiend , who sat in the mountains and invented age and death and procrastination and eternity . The dial was an engrossing mystery and the ticks , like metallic fleas jumping after each other , were only the pleasant little life of a pretty mechanical toy . Thus , I did not know how long it was before I heard the grinding of the buggy wheels in the driveway and the creak peculiarto the harpwoman door . But they came into the house bringing more silence with them . Dr. Torrey was a stringy darkling man with a black neurotic gimleteye . Perhaps , even then , he had long ago begun to take the morphine because of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had tried to take time and eternity by the throat and hold them still . For his black eyes stared with a fixity at something somewhere beyond my throat  --  something beyond everything and everybody in the house . I sat on the floor of the parlor , a respectful distance from the fern and heard the Hummmmmmmm ! and Ummmmm ! of Esculapius , and suffered another spoon to be thrust down my throat by Dr. Torrey , who had already begun his Pyhrric Victory against time and death and eternity.  |p145The  Crack of DoomTHAT is the first time I remember having taken to my bed with a disease . And perhaps because of the fevers , the night which Smalley spent in a death watch beside my bed stands out like a shining jewel in the field of a strong lens  --  or let us say that it is a concentratedmoment of the night . For it is now still with me in my head . It is as if a drunken man had sat all night tippling in a room which he had come into drunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly except in moments of fierce bright focus when the light seemed to pour hot and clean over the chairs and tables cutting their outlines as sharp as a microscopic photograph , so that , when the tippler awakened , the print of the room had moved into his mind as a permanent tenant and would without warning at any time throw its image into his ken like a fixed bright nightmare . Thus it was and is with me and Dr. Smalley in the death room . I lay and watched the light from the whitehot filaments bounce off the yellowing white enamel on the rods and rosettes of the bed and fall around the pinkgray chops and brindle whiskers of Smalley and insinuate itself into the beginnings of the crow 's feet at the outer corners of Smalley 's eyes and ricochet off his glasses and the syringe like breaking ice . That old iron bedstead was of the size known as three-quarter and had been painted and repainted . The surface , however , was barked in places and I could see down to the original coat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given up its hide . These and the places where the edges of the ironmonger 's molds had allowed the metal to form little fans of iron in corners where the rods joined gave the bed a cheaper look than the ironmonger had intended it to have  --  which was cheap enough . Yet I can remember still how my mother used to refer to the ugly , bleak little bed with somethingp146of the same possessive love that she used to refer to Poor Yorick , though not in quite the same degree , as my little iron three-quarter bed . And it was not even her secondbest bed . The top of each iron post was supposed to have a screwed-on brassball ornament to top it off in elegance but the one at the right hand of the foot was missing  --  lost in some moving long ago , for God knows where the bed had come from  --  perhaps Elgin or Sedan . The three others were dented and paint-spattered and awry on the screws which held them . Now for a long time I lay indifferent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now that the slategray afternoon had deepened to dark , that this was the first death watch of my life . It was unaccountable that my mother had cried when she undressedme and I said : Mamma , why are you crying ? Why , Lover ! Why , Sonnybug , she said , her voice breaking a little . You must be seeing things . Mamma was n't crying . I had struggled against her undressing me ; and the vile harness which held up the bunchy ribbed black stockings I wore had fouled . But now I was in bed in a suit of flannelette pajamas ( I called them night pants ) which enclosed my feet . I had struggled so hard that I must have dropped off into a feverish half sleep , almost a semi-coma . When I awoke breathing in somewhat of a labored way , Smalley was sitting there in the bright light blinking his blue eyes . He had taken off his coat and collar and I remember I thought it funny that Dr. Smalley was sitting there in the back bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were alone  --  though I 've no doubt that Nora was somewhere near , anxiously waiting to find out the result of my fight with death . And perhaps my father was out with Dr. Torrey getting some more units of antitoxin  --  or he may have been at my Grandfather Harrington 's house in bed . For they must already have tacked the red and black sign on the front of the house near the mailbox : Diphtheria ! Keep Out ! As I think of it now , it must have been late . There was no sound at all except a brief sob or two of wind and the tinny ticking of the old Waterbury alarm clock which sat , like a brummagem moon , on one of those things which were called wardrobe chiffoniers ( half dresser and half upended grave box finished in lovely quarterp147sawed oak ) . Leaning in an empty corner near the bedhead stood the leather scabbarded Filipino guerilla sword that Dr. Yenser of the Temple of Health had given me . And above it on the wall a small bright backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased blinking and shut , and there was no sound from the wind . I looked down over the old cotton blanket and saw the little beanlike bunches which many washings had raised in it . The doctor had not seen my eyes open and I lay still as the death who was almost in my mother 's three-quarter bed with me . But then , time was not there . For all I knew or cared , the Swiss might have saved himself the labor with his gears and springs and escapements from which there is no escape . I was not yet caught in his Devil 's device . I did not care a damn , a whoop in hell about yesterday or tomorrow . I could have been a bit of languor caught in fixative . Meanwhile Smalley nodded a little and the bright yellow light from Mr. Hogarty 's mill burned on . We were a tableau prisonedin amber while all eternity and death loitered and softly looked . And as I lay there I saw the sword and idly contemplated cutting Smalley 's head in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an onion or a turnip or like the folding diagram in Nora 's Doctor Book folded back . And then , I think the brief moment with eternity was broken . I began to wheeze like a blacksmith 's bellows : and Smalley 's light eyes came open stickily and he got up , picked a glare of glass and nickel plate , pointed and plungered , from the wardrobe chiffonier . Well , Lee , how do you feel ? Have trouble breathin ' ? Huh ? he said . He pulled the cover down and opened my pajamas . Turn over , he said and bared my bottom . I felt the needle sting and the plunger go down , making the potion stretch the skin of my arse . There , he said . Did n't hurt , did it ? The carbonbulb burned on  --  but death and eternity turned aside . Yes , Lee said , death and eternity turned aside just as they had bent down to be my bedfellow . The appointment book was checked and it was found that I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mad static light of the room with the whole world around me  --  everything going on . Perhaps James Joyce was at Trinity College , Dublin and already contemplatingthe ineluctable modality of the visible , perhaps Albert Herbert Mullin , Boots at Pembroke College , Oxford , was just taking off his Oxford City blazer to bowl a century against Maidenhead . At any rate , I was lying there in a bright static whirl of nuclear light in a small circle of madness , my breath coming in fastgasps . And Smalley was beside me in the small hours . They were small enough : I was hardly aware of them , or perhaps , more properly , they were not there at all . They never existed except as some squiggles on paper : 15th October , 19- , 3 A.M. R. Lee Harrington almost died of a diphtheritic fever , but the membrane covering his windpipe snapped . A contemplated drastic action in the form of a high tracheotomy , while indicated , did not become necessary . The older method of introduction of a silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the attending physician , one Richard Smalley , M.D. Universitatis Kansiensis , Class of ' 94 , superseded , by the subcutaneous injection of eight thousand units of diphtheria anti-toxin , introduced subcutaneouslyvia the patient 's hip , while in time and eternity the light from Mr. Hogarty 's mill on the river burned on . Snap ! the membrane said not loudly but politely and stepped aside for the rush of clean October morning air into the bronchia of R. Lee Harrington , and he felt a great relief and lived . Dr. Richard Smalley , more gray than pink , looking as if he himself had pulled himself from the womb of night with a pair of his own obstetrical forceps , got up from the kitchen chair in which he had been sitting , scratched his back , picked up his collar and tie out of all time and said , as the tableau moved over into the past : Mrs. Harrington , I 'd like to wash my face . Nora was there standing at the foot of the bed . She had not taken off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Torrey came . But her dark eyes were bright and her head alert and cocked a little to one side . Why , yes , Doctor , she said worshipfully . Yes , just go into the little bathroom off thep149kitchen . There 's a clean towel there . Myohmy ! Did you hear that snap ? That must have been that old membrane . Ummmm ! Smalley said and rubbed a brindle whisker as he went out to wash . Now that the tableau had moved over into the mad eternity , where everything remains  --  where everything can not get rid of itself , I , the resurrected , I , for whom the stone had been rolled away , lurched crazily upward in the bed which had forever lost the honor of becoming my deathbed and said : What snap , Mamma ? Nora moved quickly to my side and said , Now , Sonnybug , you just lay back down and do n't exert yourself . You 're still a pretty sick boy . This was true . My bout with eternity had left me sweating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fevers , they now had left me , and I fell , icy , back to the pillow , still inquiring weakly , What snap ? My my , Nora said . Son you 're like ice ! Get under the cover or you 'll catch your death of cold . What snap , Mamma ? I said . Now you stay under that cover until Mamma gets a bath towel and some clean night pants and a hot water bottle . She went out of the room , came back with the towel and pajamas and set to work rubbing me hard as I shivered . Now , she said . Get your feet into these dry night pants quick so Mamma can pull them up . What snap ? I said . Dr. Smalley was standing in the door with the kitchen stove and the kitchen cabinet behind him . He looked pinkly awake now and dandified as a village Gronow or Brummell , with his brindle whiskers combed and the vagueness washed out of his eyes . He pulled elegantly at a cuff and scratched his back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the gray morning beginnings now coming through the windows . His quiet voice now crackled somewhat dryly as if a dried leaf had hit the curbstone in a gust . That snap , my boy , was the crack of doom and something that you 'll be glad you heard someday . Now you do what your mother says and get down in bed there . I 'm goin ' home and get some sleep . And if Dr. Smalley finds you 've disobeyed your mother when he gets back , he 'll skin youp150alive . He yawned briefly and beckoned my mother who followed him into the kitchen from where I could hear the soft mysterious buzz of voices saying things you were n't supposed to hear . A conference , after death was routed in the back bedroom . Nora came back into the room screwing the top in an old gray hot waterbottle . And as she leant over me I caught the clean sweet mothersmell of her hair . She put her cool light hand on my forehead . My icy sweat had gone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinny flea tick of the clock and the coal fire crackling in the kitchen cookstove and the creaking of a board and the closing of a door . All the usual morningsounds of the house on a fall day were around me : and I was now warm and comfortableagain with the sweet smell of my mother 's hair in my nostrils  --  and the world well lost  --  wiped off the map . Nothing existed then except the snug languorous comfort of the house and the protection of home and home life . Mamma , Mamma ! I said . What was that snap ? Well , Sonnybug , Nora said , you 're the limit ! Well the crackadoomis something that happens when  --  oh my  --  the crackadoom is the crackadoom . You just ask Dr. Smalley when he comes back . And though I was supposed to have heard that snap in my throat  --  and years afterwards Nora would say : Myohmy ! You remember , Son , how that old membrane snapped in your throat , you could hear it all over the house  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe I did . For it would be awful to admit I had missed the crackadoom.  |p151My  Lady MorphiaAND so , Lee said , softly in a grieving voice , Providence was vindicated and I lived to cumber an unwilling world despite the crack of doom . Like Benvenuto Cellini , I had escaped the scorpion and seen the salamander burst into flames  --  nay better , I now knew the crack of doom , the death watch , the small hours , all in Fork City , Kansas . I believe , Lee said , his voice low-keyed , from the green death he had been pouring down his gullet , I believe that Thomas Horton Moriarty , the last of the frontier marshals , died indecently in a Kansas City hospital bed with his boots off the night I heard the snap in my throat . He died indecently with his boots off and left Fork City at the mercy of the Town Boys , two regiments of cavalry , one battalion of artillery , some thousand-odd small boys , eighteen whorehouses and fifteen saloons ( all wideopen hostelries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kilrush in County Clare through the Mediterranean , the Crimea and Nassau up the Mississippiand thence to the Rockies , where he beat the Terror of the Gulch . A great cruel hardfisted Hibernian he was , who would for the love of his brute pride in his bloody muscles make any man kiss his Royal Irish Arse . Three weeks later Curley Dallgren and three first sergeants shat upon his grave . He and I had distinguished the night in Fork City . Perhaps it was the next day , for the bright syringe still lay on the wardrobe chiffonier , that the strange thing happened . I lay half-awake , between sleep and daydreaming , when I heard the Oriental harpwoman door creak above the fleaticks of the old alarm clock . I opened my eyes to the thinness of a dime and saw loose hanging coat hung halfway up in the doorway and then the white face and the dark gimleteyes . The feet were silent without even a shoe squeak  --  and he came to the bedside , a blackhaired chalky hand hanging down on my eye level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small trap doors of vision open , and Torrey looked down at me and listened , reached for my wrist and thought better of it . Maybe the anti-toxin syringe gave him the idea , for as he turned his head he saw it lying there beside a cup of water on the wardrobe-chiffonier , its bright nickel and glass burning upward in the carbonlight . The hand which had started for my wrist went into the inside pocket of his black elegant scarecrow 's coat and came out swift and silent with a small leather case . His ' face gave me one fast cadaveric look , like a mask turned on a stick . And then the hands , much like old white marble overgrown with black moss began a little dance with the cap of a brighter ( all metal ) syringe than the one Smalley had left and a thin small vial . Two small tablets , then the water pulled up into the syringe . Torrey did not even take his coat off . He unbuttoned the buttons of his black surgeon 's sleeve with dainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the needle was aimed and sunk and the marble thumb pricked down the plunger forcing the heart balm toward the wounded heart . Amity Prentiss , standing before the easel in her studio in Firenze , what would she have thought ? Emanuel Torrey , you have jilted me for My Lady Morphia . She has you hooked tighter than ever I had you . Torrey restored his dope kit to his pocket and buttoned the buttons of his surgeon 's sleeve . Then he turned his mask on a stick look at me again , grabbed the tinny old alarm clock , which gave a time rattle in his hand , and with swift sureness , unscrewed one of the screws from its back . He held it up under the carbon bulbs and regarded it with a look of blank and fierce voluptuousness . Then he held it to his cheek and rocked his gravestone face from side to side . After that he held the small brass screwhead away from him with something of suppliant admiration and then bedded it down carefully in his vest pocket  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes became , for an instant , warm and rapt . In the middle of this lovepat to a timescrew , he seemed to get his eyes focussed on me , which caused him to pull down the vest and caress his blue and white silk polkadot four-in-hand , before he sat down in the kitchenchair beside my bed . Once seated , thep153Hippocratical mantle fell over his shoulders and he took my hand in a limp cold mitt as lightly as a young sweet girl . I feigned to awaken : and he spoke as warmly to me as blood flowing through a gentle heart . There , there young man . Do n't be afraid of Dr. Torrey . Dr. Torrey knows you 're all right now . A fine and healthy boy . He put his insubstantial cold hand on my forehead with a feminine flutter . And then , slick as warm oil , he pulled out a fat gold huntingcased Waltham watch on a rich gold logchain and pushed its gold head so that the lid flew up from the gold and ivory dial . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a photograph of somebody in the lid at which he stared absently  --  Amity Prentiss , maybe . So , Lee said , I lay there after the crack of doom , attended by a smalltown geepee , who was tamped to the ears with hop . A sentimentalJunkie who was ripping out his heart about love unrequited and jeopardizing the lives of his patients to indulge his romantic vanity . Later on , that night , I think he went down to Morro Castle on eleventh street and had the blonde named Mabel bite his ears until they bled . But maybe it was not that night , nor any night . It may have been just a story ; and Torrey may have suffered more than Dante from a deep love thrown aside so that he was not only lost in eternity but fuddled with morphia in it . But despite him and Smalley , I lived and am now here to regret it . I have yet to crack my doom  |p154WHEN  Papa was going to the Commercial Club one night , I said , Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Papa ! Well , I do n't know , Son . You 'll have to ask your Mamma . Mamma , can I go to the picture-show ? I can go to the CommercialClub when it 's out and come home with Papa . Well , Bob , we can let the child go tonight , ca n't we ? Mamma said . Papa started putting on his coat ( I can see his humped shouldersgoing into it now ) and said : All right , come along , Son . When we got to the Borealis , I said : Papa , can I have a nickel for candy too  --  please , Papa . Papa gave me a dime and I said thank you ; and ran up to the ticket window and bought my ticket and got a nickel back . I was always a little scared by the phonograph horn which as I remember it was always playing something like Pony Boy or Oh You Great Big Beautiful Doll , and the arch of electric lights , but I went in . I did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls with rose garlanded picture hats , but I liked the actor called William S. Hart and the bad man in the picture and the Charley Chaplin comedy . When it was over I ran out of the Borealis and went to Mr. Handy 's candy store and bought a nickel 's worth of nigger-faces and ran up to the Commercial Club and knocked on the door . Mr. Jim Burble let me in and said , kind of like Uncle Joe : Well , ho , ho , ho , ho ! Look here , we 've got a new member , boys ! How are you , Lee , my boy ? He leant over and patted me on the shoulder , and I noticed he smelt like Uncle Joe . I liked him . Papa came out of the billiard room with a cue in his hand , and said : Well , Son , did you like the show ?  |p155Yes  , Papa . Well , you go in there in the other room and look at the magazines while Papa finishes his game . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl in there  --  a kind of skinny little girl . Hello , she said , and then she turned around and I saw it was Melba Keylinger . My father 's playing billiards with your father . Will you give me some candy ? I gave her a nigger-face , although I did n't want to much , and we ate nigger-faces and looked at the pictures in Leslie 's Weekly . I been to the picture show , I said . Was it good ? Melba asked . Yeh , you bet . It was Bill Hart . Oh , cowboys and Indians ! No , robbers . Jesse James , I think . Bill Hart was somebody named Wild Bill . We ate all of my licorice nigger-faces and got sticky . Melba saw an open window where there was a flat roof and we climbed out on the roof . I would have been scared if I had n't known Papa was right inside . When we got outside I suddenly had to pee-pee and I began dancing around . There was a dark corner near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the building . I did n't think she 'd see me . I hurried so I would n't wet my pants . While I was doing it , I did n't notice that Melba came up and was standing beside me watching  --  until I could n't stop . I have n't got one of those . I have n't got anything at all , Melba said . Yes , you have , I said . No , I have n't ! Melba said . Lookee here ! Melba pulled up her skirt and down her pants , and I was trembling and puzzled as I looked for what was not there . There was n't anything . But what happened to it ? Melba buttoned her panties and let her skirt fall and said : My mamma took a pair of scissors and cut it off and threw it out the window . Did n't it hurt ? I asked . Not very much , Melba said . Do n't you tell anybody.  |p156No  , I wo n't , I said . We climbed back inside the Commercial Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , and so was Mr. Keylinger , who carried a cane . Mr. Keylinger said : What have you two kids been up to ? We just went out to see the roof , Papa , Melba said . Mr. Keylinger laughed and said to Papa : They 're starting to court pretty young , eh Bob ? Then Mr. Brick Anson , the Chief of Police , came up chewing his cigar from one corner of his mouth to the other and said : Bob , I saw this big boy of yours out on the street after the curfew tonight . Is that all right or should I have him put in the cooler ? I caught hold of Papa 's hand because I was afraid of Brick Anson . But Papa said : That 's all right Brick . I told him to meet me here . Mr. Keylinger said : Bob , I 've got my new EMF downstairs . I 'll take you and this gentleman home . He put his hand on my shoulder , and I drew away from him . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Keylinger and Papa . Mr. Keylinger and Papa crankedthe automobile and lighted the carbide lights , and Melba and I gotin the back seat ; and we bumped along to the house on Third street . As I got out of the automobile , Melba whispered , Do n't youSister Aquinas was nicer than Sister Therese . Now that I was in her room , I thought she was the best teacher in the world , and I loved Sister Aquinas . She used to stand in front of the class and twist her ebony and brass cross , with the hinges on the end where it opened , ( What was in that cross ? Was it a reliquary ? ) around in her fingers as she talked to us . And when anything black got on her big white collar , she would take a piece of chalk and mark over the place and say : Chalk covers a multitude of sins , with a little smile . She had a big mole with hairs in it on one of her cheeks andp157she wore glasses and had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there were some of the pupils who did n't like Sister Aquinas very well . There was Steve Donnell , whose father made and sold hominy from a boy 's wagon with a leaf lard can on it , who did n't like Sister . He was always saying : Old Sister Aquinas ! when he spoke of her . That was because she scolded him because he never got his lessons . Steve 's ears stuck out , and he was freckle-faced and loudmouthed . One day in the wintertime , when it was awful cold , I did n't go outdoors at recess but stayed in Sister Aquinas 's room . Steve and Steve 's sister , Patricia , and Vee Crump were in the room too and Pat Whitaker and John Roamer . Steve got up and got the empty water bucket off the platform where Sister 's desk was and acted as if he were peeing in it and sloshed the imaginary water around as if he were rinsing the bucket and threw the pretendedcontents of the bucket at his sister , Patricia . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants . Patricia got pinker than she was generally and that was pretty pink . I looked down hard at the book on my desk , but I looked sideways at Patricia and Vee Crump and I thought I saw Patricia start to giggle . But she frowned and said : Steve Donnell , you get outa here , or I 'll tell Sister on you . Doing dirty things like that ! **26;2638;TOOLONG ! Steve laughed and then he said , Aw-eee ! Aw-eee ! like a donkey . Go ahead an ' tell ' er . I 'll tell ' er what I saw you an ' Henry doin ' out behind the barn ! Vee Crump held her head down and did n't say anything . I got up , my face burning , and went out into the cold snowy air . It was almost Christmas vacation , and Sister was going to have a Christmas program and a little play pretty soon  --  before school let out for two weeks . I was in the play . Sister said I was good because I was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was about a thief who was caught and made to repent at Christmas time . I was the thief and John Roamer was the man who caught me . . . I looked down the wooden walk and saw James Pernod in a black and white robe , coming out of the church . James was inp158Sister Aquinas 's room too and he helped Father Ryan in the Church . Steve Donnell thought James was a sissy . I thought James walked like a girl . Say , I said to James , you ought 've seen what Steve Donnell did in there in front of his sister and Vee Crump . I showed James what Steve had done . Oh , that old Steve Donnell , James said . He 's a dirty boy . James put his light hand on my shoulder , and I thought it was queer because it was almost like Mamma putting her hand on me or like Kathleen Carter kissing me on the back of the neck when I was standing in line outside the Fourth street schoolhouse when I was in Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden walk to the schoolhouse in the religious robes and thought that James did walk like a girl .. . Father Ryan came in one afternoon and everybody got up and said : Praise Jesus Christ , Father ! only they said it so fast it sounded like just , Jesus Christ , Father ! Steve Donnell said it just like he was swearing . Sister Aquinas stood aside for Father and Father said : We 'll now listen to yer Bible history . He looked right at Steve Donnell with a stern face and everybody was quiet . Steve Donnell 's stick-out ears got white , because everybody could see that Father was in a mean mood . You , Steve ! Father said , snapping , Who was it had a coat of many colors and was sold into bondage by his brothers ? Steve stood up and looked down at the floor and mumbled something . Father looked madder and meaner . Father snapped his fingers and said : Well , do ye know or do n't ye ? Be quick ! I du n no , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aquinas , you will send Stephen Donnell to me at recess . Yes , Father , Sister said . Steve sat down , but Father said : Steve Donnell , stand up ! Yes , Father , Steve said and stood up again ; and I could see that there were tears in Steve 's eyes.  |p159Now  , Stephen Donnell , that will do , Father said . And do n't ye ever sit down again until Father 's finished with ye ! Well , sit down ! Yes , Father , Steve said and sat down and that was the first and last time I ever saw Steve crying . You , Patrick Whitaker ! Father said , who was it had a coat of many colors and was sold into bondage by his brothers ? I do n't know , Father , Pat said . I saw he was scared too . Terrible ! Terrible ! Father said . I 'm ashamed for ye ! Sister , I 'll bet you Lee Harrington , who does n't even take Bible history can answer up to that question . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coat of many colors and was sold into bondage by his brothers ? I felt myself get hot and tremble and I got up and said in an awful quiet voice : It was Joseph , Father . There , Father said , what 'd I tell ye ? Very good , very good , Lee ! Lee has put ye all to shame . We will take the same lesson tomorrow  --  and , I warn ye , do n't let this happen again . Praise Jesus Christ , Father ! everybody said as Father went out the door of Sister Bernadette 's room . When Father was gone Steve turned and looked hard at me . I knew that Steve was looking at me even if I did n't look back at him . I was afraid . All the rest of the afternoon I dreaded the time for prayers to come because I knew Steve was looking at me . But Sister rang the little bell on her desk , and we all turned around and knelt in our seats and began fast : Hail Mary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and the Our Father so they could get out . I walked out slowly but Steve was waiting for me by the stone wall on the other side of the playgrounds and Pat Whitaker was there and Frog Hara and a lot of the other boys . And Steve grabbed my coat and said : What 'd you answer that question right for , Goddamn you ? I could n't help it , Steve ! Leave me alone ! It 's no fair . You 're in the eighth grade and bigger'n me ! I said . Steve 's mouth bubbled at the corners with spit and Steve 's face looked sticky-dirty and Steve said : Oh shit ! I do n't care a shit what grade you 're in . You did it just to get that old Sister Aquinas down on me and get me in trouble with old Father Ryan !  |p160I  did not ! I just answered ! I said . Steve took his hand off my coat and said : I 'm gon na give the Goddamn ' teacher 's pet a chance  --  put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fence and the wall , so I put up my hands and Steve came at me , and I dodged and squirmed and tried to hit Steve and could n't and Steve hit me in the mouth and my mouth began to bleed and tears came to my eyes . Steve said : Take that one , Goddamn you , teacher 's pet ! I broke through the crowd and ran towards home and Steve and Pat Whitaker and the boys followed me shouting : Teacher 's pet ! Mamma asked me what was the matter with my lip and I thought of the switching I got in the third grade up at Fourth street schoolhouse , so I said : I fell down , Mamma . Oh Lover , I 'm sorry . Let Mamma see . She 'll fix it . Mamma put her arms around me and I cried and Mamma said : Do n't cry , sweetheart . It 'll be all right . I never let Mamma know I 'd had another fight . The Friday when school let out for Christmas vacation , Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candles and statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary . There was a big Christmastree up front with presents on it for everybody , because everybody had drawn somebody else 's name to give a present to . I got John Roamer 's , and Mamma bought me a pair of mittens to give to John . But I wished I had got Vee Crump 's name because she was a pretty girl and I liked her , although I had n't even spoken to her over once or twice . In the afternoon , everybody put his books away and Sister said : Now when the mothers come today I want you to be very good and make Sister proud of you . After the program you may go right home . And a Merry Christmas to everybody ! Merry Christmas , Sister ! everybody shouted  --  even Steve Donnell . Then everybody got up and went up to Sister 's desk and gave her their presents for her . Sister smiled and thanked everybody and looked as if she wanted to cry . I gave her some plain linen handker/chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything fancy  --  it was against the rules of their order . After a while our mothers began to come in and some of the brothers and fathers . They sat in the empty seats and chairs in the aisles from the church . I saw Mamma come in looking pretty in a dark blue suit and a new hat . Mamma spoke to Sister and sat down in the corner . Then Father came in . He had Sergeant Doyle and Dr. FitzGeraldwith him . Father was redder in the face than usual . Sergeant Doyle walked kind of funny . But everybody got up and said : Praise Jesus Christ , Father ! Merry Christmas , Father ! Father said : Merry Christmas to all of ye . You may sit down . Then he said a prayer and said after that : Now children and parents of the St. Joseph 's Parochial School , I have brought a very dear friend of the school to speak a few words to ye . I think ye all know Sergeant Doyle . Well , yer goin ' to speak pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give ye some poetry too . Sergeant Doyle ! Sister started to clap and everybody clapped . Sergeant Doyle came up to the front of the platform still walking funny and began to talk . I 'll bet ye do n't know this poem about Mary-had-a-little-lamb , do ye ? Everybody was quiet with a kind of funny quietness . I looked at Sister who looked a little scared and then back at Mamma , who did n't look any way at all like I 'd ever seen her look . Sergeant Doyle began the poem : Mary had a little lamb , And it was full of mutton . And every time it wagged its tail Sergeant Doyle kind of stopped and looked around , and Steve Donnell began to grin  --  and somebody coughed . Then Sergeant Doyle finished the poem : It showed its Bull Moose button !  |p162Sister  Aquinas was most red in the face but she began to clap again . Steve Donnell laughed in a deep kind of a froggy voice which broke high . Everybody clapped and laughed ; and Sergeant Doyle bowed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pernod was blushing . Sister Aquinas , will ye go ahead with the program ? Father Ryan said . Everybody said pieces , and I only forgot in the play once  --  and I got a sock full of candy on the tree from Vee Crump 's father 's store . On the way home , I said : Mamma , Sergeant Doyle was funny , was n't he ? Yes , the old pill ! Mamma said . Mamma , what 's he a sergeant of ? I said . - Why he was a sergeant in the Spanish American War , honey  --  the Civil War , asfarasaskenserned . Like Grandpa  --  in the Civil war , Mamma ? Yes , darling , I think so . Mamma , will I get an airgun and an erector for Christmas ? Now Sweetheart , I do n't know . Well , how many days until Christmas , Mamma ? Why , Christmas is day after tomorrow , darling , Mamma said . Say , Mamma , what 's a Bull Moose button ? Why honey , that 's a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's like Grandpa 's Taft button . Christmas morning I found the airgun and the Mysto-Erector set near the Christmas tree and a lot of other things.  |p163Another  trip on the trainTHAT was the summer Mamma decided to take Grandma out to Riverside , California to see Great Grandma Hanks , Grandma 's mother , who was ninety-six years old . I was going along , and I was deeply excited again . Now that I was older I could have more fun than I had when I went to Philadelphia and saw Uncle Joe and Aunt Alice and the ferris wheel  --  and ate the hot waffle . I asked Mamma if it was a long trip on the train , and she said : Yes ; four days and four nights , honey . I thought that that was good , for I still liked to ride on trains , and there were still a lot of things to do on trains . But about a week before we were to leave Dee Given and Breezy Gortz and John Roamer and Ed Carter came over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's go swimming . There 's a good place down to the Shejaw bridge . Mamma overheard and said : No , Lee . Do n't you go near that old river you ca n't tell what might happen . I wo n't stand for it ! As much as I could plead it would n't do any good . Dee had overheard Mamma , so he said : Aw hell , do n't pay any attention to Nora . Charley and Edna raise the devil too , but that 's all the good it does ' em . But you do n't know my mother ! I said , thinking it was daring of Dee to call his parents by their first names . Breezy Gortz and Ed Carter laughed like anything , but they went on and left me out of the swimming party . When Papa came home , I said : Papa , Mamma would n't let me go swimming down to the Shejaw bridge with Dee Given and Breezy Gortz and Ed Carter and John Roamer . Well , I do n't know 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient and Papa 'll take you and teach you to swim , Papa said . When , Papa  --  before we go to California ? Tomorrow ? Please , Papa !  |p164I  kept after Papa so much that Papa and Doc Yenser took me down to the Shejaw . We went into the shallow water , and Papa held me up while I kicked and tried to paddle . By God , Bob , I bet the boy 'll be a champeen swimmer one of these days . Hmmmm  --  yes sir , son ! That 's damn ' good . Doc Yenser 'll bet on you ! Doc Yenser said . I did n't learn a thing about swimming . I felt cold and uncomfortableand was glad to leave the river . The next day Mamma and Grandma and I got on the train and started for Riverside , California where Great Grandma Hanks lived . We were riding in a Pullman tourist car because Mamma said she just thought she would try the Pullman tourist cars this time . I do n't remember the trip very well except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the desert because he said it would run out . It was so hot and dusty and people hung up wet sheets and towels in front of the windows and Mamma fanned me and said : My but this old desert is awful ! I do n't think it was nearly so hot when I went out to see Grandma Hanks the first time  --  and that was in the summer too . How old were you then , Mamma ? I said . And Mamma said : I was just nineteen years old , and my , if I do say it myself , I was pretty as a picture , and I had an awful good time . On the way back there was a washout on the road . The train stopped at Flagstaff , Arizona : and the conductor stepped off the train in water up to his knees . The engineer wanted to go on , but the conductor told him if he took that train out of there , he was on his own  --  so we stayed . The wires were all down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . We were there five days and five nights . We had a wonderful time ; we did most everything in that little town . The railroad company had to feed us after the first twenty-four hours . Gee , I said . That must have been a lot of fun , Mamma ! Oh , it was , honey . Yes , I was visiting Grandma Hanks and Aunt Hettie and my brother , Harry . He died two years later and was buried in the cemetery at Riverside . When we got to Riverside it was like a hot bed in the daytime ; and Grandma Hanks frightened me . I see her now , an old femalep165hawk , perched on the porch of a bungalow , straight as the cane she leant on , standing in the noonday sun with perhaps a wrinkled shadow lying rigid before her . Hurrump ! she said . He 's not a Hanks . Ner a Beckham neither . Something from North Carolina . She was ninety-six . She 'd lost the orange grove  --  you used to drive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't intend to die now . Myra , she said to my grandmother , ignoring my mother , bring the little pig here and I 'll give him a cooky . I suppose he is a little pig . They 're all little pigs . And she reached one of her old female hawk 's claws for the little pig . I started to run . But they took me to the Glenwood Mission Inn and there were underground passages with candles . There was a place there with great big swords with saw teeth on the ends . I thought that was a fine place . The street where Grandma Hanks lived was dull except for one afternoon when I found a boy riding a tricycle and asked him : What 's your name ? The boy said : Henry Skunky , and then did n't say anything more . I told Grandma about it , and Grandma said : Nora , this child said he found a boy named Henry Skunky . Henry Skunky ! Mamma said . My what a name ! And everybodylaughed . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry ! That 's not my name , the boy said . You said your name was Henry Skunky , I said . Yes , I know , the boy said screwing up his freckle-face , but I decided I 'm not Henry Skunky any more . Say , what 's wrong with your eye ? I stuck a sword in it , and Mamma threw the sword away , I said . The boy did n't say anything more , but rode away on his tricycle , and I never saw him again . That night at supper I told Mamma and Grandma and everybodyabout the boy deciding he was n't Henry Skunky any more . Mamma laughed and said : I decided I 'm not Henry Skunky any more . That 's just pretty good ! Then she looked at me and said , Lee , darling , what 's the matter with you ? Your face is all flushed up . Come over here to Mamma and let Mamma see your tongue ! Myohmy ! Aw , Mamma , I 'm all right ! I said as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt my forehead and said : Aunt Hettie can you call your doctor right away ; the boy 's burning up with fever ! I was afraid of that old river ! Mamma , I 'm all right , I said . You 're going to bed right away , Sonnybug  --  do n't you fight with Mamma , Mamma said . In spite of all I could say , they took me upstairs in Grandma Hanks 's house and put me to bed . Pretty soon the doctor came and put the thermometer in my mouth and the cold stethoscope on my hot chest and felt my pulse . There 's considerable congestion of the lungs , Mrs. Harrington , the doctor said to Mamma and  --  but I did n't hear any more . Mamma , I want to get up , I said . I got out of bed , and Mamma ran and put me in bed and sat down beside the bed and held my hand . But Mamma , it 's too early to go to bed , I said . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep . After that I did n't want to get up and then I could n't have got up if I had wanted to . I did n't get up for a long time . Once I heard Mamma say something about unconscious . I did n't know how long I was in bed because I was asleep most of the time  --  or , at least , I thought I was asleep . Once I heard Mamma talking to Grandma about telegraphing Papa . Then one day I heard Mamma say : Oh , Mamma , Bob wants us to bring the child home . Oh Nora , I would n't attempt to move that child now , Grandma said . I 'm not , Mamma . I 'll wait until I see the doctor . We goin ' home , Mamma ? I asked . Pretty soon , darling , she said . Myohmy  --  . I thought Mamma was going to cry . Then one day Mamma put me into my clothes , and I got down off the side of the bed and my legs wobbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't you overdo ! Mamma said . In two or three days we got on a train for home . Mamma got thep167porter to leave the berth made up all the time and made me stay in it . Then morning came when I could hear the engine pulling hard and making a lot of noise ; Mamma came to the berth and said : Sonnybug , look out of the window , because this is the highest point on the railroad . It was a place called Helper , Utah , and it looked cold and clear and crisp outside . There were a lot of the longest engines I had ever seen in my life  --  maybe a half a block long . There were some men in warm coats over overalls walking around with shovels and long oil-cans and I could hear their feet crunch faintly on the gravel . Look at the big engines for the mountains , Mamma ! I said . I coughed and for a minute , I could n't get my breath . It 's the altitude , Mamma said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskey , please ? Yes , Ma'am , the porter said and smiled . He came back quickly . Mamma gave me a little whiskey , and I felt funny . I could barely hear Mamma saying when the train started : My , I 'm glad we 're going . It 's downgrade now . I was afraid of that old altitude . My , oh my ! When we got home , I did n't care when they put me to bed again . Papa called Dr. Southern who lived in the house Papa owned next door , and Miss Shaw came to nurse me . I thought they said she was a train nurse  --  and that meant she came on a train . I did n't ask because I did n't care much about anything . I was in bed downstairs in the dining-room , and Mamma or Miss Shaw slept on the cot next to me . Doctor Southern would come in smelling like Uncle Joe and Sergeant Doyle and take my pulse and give me bitter medicine that was made of drops put in glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old Dr. Southern , Mamma said . Just because he rents our house is no signNow , Nora , do n't you worry , Papa said . Dr. Southern 's all right . Papa , can I have a bicycle with a light and a horn and a stand on it ? I said.  | Papal see , son , Papa said . When he came home from the studio he brought a bicycle catalogue . I looked at it and picked out a bicycle and a light like on the Overland automobile and a klaxon horn and a three-speed coaster brake . Papa said he 'd order it . I thought and thought of the bicycle and the horn and the lamp . One day they came and Papa uncrated them in the back yard and brought them in and put them together beside the bed , and stood the bicycle there . It was a fine bicycle , all gleaming and new , and Papa worked the horn for me . It 's better than the one your Papa paid a hundred and twentyfivedollars for when safety-bicycles first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaster brake  --  let alone a three-speed thingamajig , Papa said as he looked at the bicycle . One night I heard Mamma and Papa and Dr. Southern talking in low voices beside my bed , and they thought I could n't hear them . Dr. Southern said : Well , tonight will probably be the crisis . And the thing of it is to stay beside the boy and if anything happens call me and I 'll be right over . And see that he gets those liquid peptonoids to keep his strength up . Do you think everything 'll be all right , Doctor ? Mamma asked . Well , I think so  --  I think so , Dr. Southern said . The thing of it is Papa did n't say anything but he came and sat by the bed a while . I tried to say hello to him and tell him that I knew all about what was going on . I knew that I was going to die , but I did n't care much  --  only I wanted to ride the new bicycle that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead lightly , and looked at me . I tried to say that I wanted to ride the bicycle , but I could n't say anything . Papa said : Do n't try to talk , son . I heard the doorbell ring , and Mamma brought in a dozen roses and showed them to me and read me the card which said : From Grace Schmutz , with best wishes for a speedy and happy recovery . Mamma and Papa looked at each other . I thought it was funny . I did n't know Mrs. Schmutz , the under/taker 's wife , very well , and she was sending me flowers . I tried to laugh but I could n't make any noise . Now I knew I was dying , but if it had n't been for the bicycle I would n't have cared at all . I did n't even care much about that now , so I went to sleep .. . When I woke up , I heard Dr. Southern saying : Well , the worst is past now . Miss Shaw , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . The thing of it is I was all wet with sweat . Mamma came over and kissed me and Papa did too . I knew then I could learn to ride my new bicycle . But it was a long time before I could get up . Mamma and Miss Shaw moved me upstairs and I had to lie still all day . And Mamma and Miss Shaw and Grandpa and Grandma would read Tom Swift or Pony Rider Boys , or Motor Boys books to me . Papa brought the bicycle upstairs where I could see it and touch it . Mamma or Miss Shaw or Grandma or Grandpa or Papa were with me almost all of the time whether I was awake or asleep . I coughed a lot and had a sharp pain in the left side of my chest  --  sometimes everytime I took a breath . One day I got to coughing  --  hard  --  and could n't stop . Suddenly it felt as if something inside my chest broke . A lot of phlegm that tasted awful came up into my throat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to spit it up in . It was all reddish-brown and green and then after a while it was bloody and Mamma ran down to the ' phone and called Dr. Southern and Papa . When Dr. Southern came , I said : It came up in my throat all of a sudden and choked me . That 's just fine . Dr. Southern said . That 's the end of that old empyema . Now that lung will begin to heal . That 's what Dr. Southern was waiting for ! The thing of it isSomething broke and I could n't get my breath , I said . I looked at the frosty panes of the windows and thought how comfortable it was inside . Then I looked at my bicycle and thought how I might take trips on it  --  like out to Duck Creek . And Grandpa came in and said : Well , how 's Grandpa 's boy today ? Grandpa , will you read me out of the Motor Boys ?  |p170Grand|pa  said you just bet he would . And he read the part where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Motor Boys ' automobile . Noddy Nixon was mean , was n't he ? I said . He was a holy terror ! Grandpa said . But you just wait , they 'll get him in the end . You just bet your bottom dollar ! And after a while , I went to sleep . It was April when Dr. Southern said I could get up for a little while . Do n't let the boy overdo , he said , but let him get out in the sun for a while . The thing of it is , Mrs. Harrington , not to let him overdo . I tried to jump out of bed , and when my feet touched the floor , I nearly fell . My feet and legs felt prickly again like they had at Grandma Hanks 's in California . But Mamma helped me to get dressed and to walk downstairs and go out on the front porch . Elopus Lincoln , Papa 's nigger , was in the front yard taking away the last of the old maple tree he had cut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lee ! You well now , ai n't you ? ' Lopus , will you teach me how to ride my bicycle ? I said , squinting in the sunlight . Suah , ' Lopus said , like the little china watermelon boy in the seashell . I teach you in no time . But it was a long time before they would let me try to ride  --  and then I was a long time learning . ' Lopus finally taught me and I could ride by myself . Dee Given and Breezy Gortz and John Roamer and Ed Carter thought it was a fine hike , but Dee said : What 's that thing on the bar , there ? That 's the thing you shift gears with , I said . It 's a three-speed coaster brake . Three speed ? Dee said . My God , Breezy , did you hear that ? The thing 's like Bob 's old Overland . Lemme ride on it , will you Lee ? Dee rode on it and shifted into low speed and suddenly his feet spun around. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New Departure coaster brake any day  --  but I thought he was just envious . Everybody had to try the new three-speed brake  --  even Jess Corey , whom I did n't know very well , and Gaylord King , who lived on a farm and a whole lot of boys . I did n't like everybody 's riding on it , but I had to be a good sport . Gee , Lee , you 're lucky ; you do n't hafta go to school ! Breezy Gortz said . Well , I been awful sick , I said . Breezy said , Yeh , but school 's worse . I 'd give anything to get out of it , would n't you , Dee ? Yeh , Dee said . This guy gets to stay outa school and Papa Bob buys him a new three-speed fur-lined bicycle . Some people have all the luck . Then one day when everybody was in school but me , I rode out toward the South bridge and started to ride back . I was standing on the pedals and pumping hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubbled up in my throat and choked me . I spat it out . It was blood  --  a red shining paint-like sheet in the sunlight . I was scared . I rode home as fast as I could , choking . When I got there I was pretty weak . Why , darling , what 's the matter ? Mamma said . Oh nothing , Mamma , I said , for I was afraid to tell her . Now Son , Mamma said , you must tell Mamma what 's the matter . Have you got a pain in your chest ? No Mamma . I did n't have a pain either , only a bubbly feeling . You 're sure ? Yes , Mamma . Mamma got a clean , white rag . Now , son , come here and spit on this for Mamma . I had to do it . There was blood on the rag . Son , come in here in the library and lie down on the couch . I 'm going to ' phone Dr. Southern . Son , why did n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Mamma said . I do n't know , Mamma . I was afraid.  |p172Now  Son , whenever anything like that happens to you , you come and tell Mamma right away . I lay in the library feeling weak and still frightened when Dr. Southern came . Well , well , young man , Dr. Southern said in a deep voice , what 's the trouble with you and that new bicycle ? Look here , Doctor , Mamma said , and showed Dr. Southern the rag . He 's been spitting blood . Dr. Southern looked worried and took my wrist to feel my pulse and said : Now , my boy , how did this happen ? Well , I was riding along on my bicycle and all of a sudden something came up in my throat , and I spit it out and it was blood . Was there much of it , Lee ? Dr. Southern asked . Well , I do n't know ; it filled my mouth . Tch , tch , tch , Dr. Southern said . It 's that old place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , you 'll have to take it easy for a while . The thing of it is , Mrs. HarringtonOh Doctor , I wo n't have to stay in bed , will I ? Now Lee , the thing of it is not to excite yourself . You 'll be all right before you know it . But I was n't . I could n't ride my bicycle . I had to lie down most of everyday . Dr. Southern shot my arm full of autogenous vaccine twice a week . Anywhere I might be I was liable to be choked suddenly with a salt-tasting gout of warm blood coming to my mouth . Most days I lay in the library on the couch reading Edgar Allan Poe and Conan Doyle and sometimes looking at the old copies of Hairbreadth Harry from The Philadelphia Press . But one day when Mamma was over at Grandma 's house across the driveway , I got the bicycle out and started to ride out of the yard and the blood came up in my mouth again and I was so weak I fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking with blood running out of my mouth and brought me inside and laid me on the couch and Dr. Southern came and said : No , Lee , I know it is n't much fun , but you must take it easy for a while . That old chest of yours is n't very strong , and you 've been a pretty sick boy . Now , that bicycle 'll keep.  |p173Oh  Son , you must n't get that old bicycle out and hurt yourself ! Mamma said . Please do n't do it again ! Myohmy ! I wo n't Mamma , but did you bring the bicycle in ? So , for a long time I was afraid to do anything . My lung had begun to hurt me . It was nearly fall again before I went outdoors , and I had almost forgotten about school and Sister Aquinas and Father Ryan and Steve Donnell and Sergeant Doyle . But one day Mamma took me to Sister Aquinas at the Sisters ' house and asked Sister Aquinas if I could n't go on with my class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a mistake to hold Lee back , Sister Aquinas said . But when I went back school was new and bewildering.  |p174A  direct ancestor of the Camera ObscuraYES , Lee said , my father made the coffins for John Swinton , the undertaker and furniture-store-keeper up at Abilene . The bereaved would bring in a stick , cut to the length of the dear-departed . John would spit tobacco-juice on the roundbellied stove , cut six inches off the stick , hand it to my father and say : One of those Goddamn ' sonuhbitches of Duffy boys kicked the bucket , Bob . Build him a kennel . At least we 'll have ice on the butter and flowers on the table . No use burying any more timber than 's needed . Hard to git . So my father fashioned the coffins ( and his coffin-stoop ) , flimsy reliquaries for the Irish Catholic farmers , veterans of Schurz 's German brigade , a couple of Union Pacific agents , a fornicated-out frontier chippy or two ( who had lingered in Abilene long after James Butler Hickok had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Men and women from Ireland to Kentucky all came to death in the bleak hot frying land of summer sirocco and frigid winter blizzards . Most of the corpses were calloused over by friction with the earth and the plowhandles and cracked by the windy cold . There were the boxes and there was fifteen cents an hour cash money  --  not just grub and a pair of homespun britches . After a while he had a suit made by an Abilene tailor  --  and an old horse and buggy . Maybe he used to think of Blowing Rock and the redclay roads of Gadkin County or the blue haze in the Piedmont as he drove along with the glassy mirage of heat dancing in front and above the horse 's ears on the dust of the Kansas road . Maybe he saw himself and Linc Morris swimming in the branch  --  and remembered the girl and the sourwood honey in the spring . Maybe he remembered the unpainted houses and the rivers of rust from the nailheads  --  and how he used to catch groundhogs as a boy. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the man with the camera . After he saw the man with the camera , it was a long time before he thought of them at all . The man with the camera was making a picture of a little boy on a pony . He had his head under a piece of black flannel at the back of the box and one hand was twisting a knurled brass screw . My father stopped in the dust and stood squinting and staring at the man focussing the camera . The bald head came out from under the cloth and said : Howdy ! Jist ketch a holt of the bridle there so 's the pony do n't run off . I ai n't had him long and he do n't stand still good yet . Bat yer eyes a time er two , Sonny , the man said . My father held the pony and stepped back as he was told when the man took off the lens cap . Stay up there a minute , Sonny , the man said . Come around back of the camery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dy-reck ancestor of the camery obscury , as used at Lake Corner by Leonard de Vincy . Jist putcher head under there and look on the groundglass . You ai n't ever seen a phottygraphartist work afore , have you ? Well  --  my father began to say that he had once , but not like this . No , the man said , I guess not . Well sir , it 's a great art . And a comin ' thing . You can bet on that . He unscrewed the camera from the tripod and lifted the boy down from the horse . Where 's my picture ? the boy said . Right there in the box , son . the man said . I want it , the boy said . Do n't you fret son . I 'll bring it to you soon as it 's finished . It 's got to grow . Yes sir , the man said , this here 's as fine an av-vocution as a man could ask fer . Look at all the great men in it . Mr. Brady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really a perfessionan art  --  and good money in it too . Everbody wants to be phottygraphed . To be a photty-graphic artist is to have entree into every genteel home . And the field ai n't overcrowded like lawr er medicine . Now if you was n't sich a fine industrious lookin ' young man  --  and did n't take so much interest in my work I would n't think of makin ' you this proposition . I 've got a pore sick old mother back in Ohio ; and I 've got to git home to her  --  so I 'm gon na make a sackerfice . All this here fine equipment  --  plates , solution , developer , pony and all goes fer twentyfive dollars  --  cash on the barlhead.  |p176Even  the plate of the boy and the secret instruction book . What do you say young man ? My father had ten dollars . He got everything but the pony . There were no plates  --  not even one of the boy who had been sitting on the pony . Nor could the boy ever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction book , secret or otherwise . But it did have a cheap single lens . My father wrote to the company and spent twenty dollars more on equipment . He took the horse and buggy and started out over the country roads , making pictures of babies and family groups . He developed them in a shed he built behind the house he and his father had built . He began to learn how to make photographs ; he hung around the photographic gallery of Hans Feist , a man who had served as a musician in Schurz 's brigade of the Army of the Potomac  --  a little German who played the tuba and lived in his own gallery , a small dusty , chemical-encrusted set of three rooms , cluttered with old Daguerreotype equipment and stacks of plates filed in boxes . The place was haunted with the Universal Photograph Stare  --  the Natural and Artistic Pose . And because there , under the little north light , so many images had been arrested and imprisoned in collodion , the gaping life of the Kansas town seemed forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glaring Kansas summer afternoon . Wedding parties with a funeral stare in their eyes , stood stiffly veiled and clamped , in serge hand-me-downs , the log chains and the wide hard palms forever uneasy . The frightened and rustically lecherous looks of bride and groom , the wooden stoicism of the family reunion , the suspicious glaze in the grandfather 's eye  --  all were preserved on the walls . And there were views , of the Fork City as it had been before Robert saw it . One a bird 's eye view of Fork City looking down on the little valley from Bully View hill . My father looked at the little boxy dots of the houses and the y of the two rivers joining in the valley ( Why , with a magnifying glass you could maybe find some people ! ) . There without a doubt , he saw Mr. Hogarty 's mill and the little Catholic church  --  and along Pawnee street he saw the Farmers ' Home  --  and the Axle saloon and Holzer 's Drugstore , and Schmutz 's Furniture store and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building in which the photograph hung . And as he looked at the Bird 's eye view of Fork City , he could see himself the young photographer , alone on the hilltop above the town , above the light and dark green squares of the outlying fields and all the self-important humming little life in the valley , setting up his tripod on the edge of the rimrock , the cattails and weeds thrusting up at his feet on the sun-baked soil  --  each single and important and engrossing . He could see himself as he worked busily and alone . He could hear himself humming Old Dan Tucker and hear Bess , his mare , stomping by the tree where he had tied her . He was above the insignificant motion in the valley . He was the Recording Angel . Then , Lee said , the town and country were open , and the roads and streets were of mud and dust , and in a forenoon 's journey to a scene to be preserved by your camera you might meet two wagons and a buggy . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ? Oh , you mean the old Gabbier place . You gone outa yer way  --  it 's about three four mile back . Yes , then , Lee said , and even after I can remember , you could get lost , for there were no concrete slabs to follow , no warnings about curves , no fear , if you had a good dependable horse  --  no drunk driving raps . This was the way my father began to be a photographer in Kansas : he loaded his camera and tripod into his buggy and started out to make pictures of the farmers ' children  --  and of the children in the surrounding towns . For a while he must have been young and free , for he was not a North Carolina carpenter 's bound boy any more , nor was he a coffin-maker . He had a horse and buggy and a camera , and his time was his own  --  and the sun 's . Consider the little boys sitting on their father 's horses , the babies on the front porch in their mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fine bulls , the horses , the men standing in front of soddy doors in galluses and jeans , the new reapers , the young girls in new calico , even the corpses in coffins ( which he had not built ) which he photographed . And consider the chicken and dumplings , the pork , the pot roast , the roasting ears , the greens , the rolls , the biscuits , the rabbit , the buttermilk , the home roasted and ground coffee , the cider , the wine that he must have eaten and drunk at his stops along the road . And think of the curious looks , the admiringp178looks that he must have had from the young farm girls with crisp skin and freckles and slim waists from bending . Perhaps , then , to a boy coming from Gadkin county North Carolina in the nineteenth century , Kansas was not so bad . Harsh and extreme as it was , Kansas was not blue and sad . To the young photographer , my father , every blade of buffalo grass , every fence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a camera in front of . And then , for that short time ( even though he helped support his family ) , he was free . Great ambition , I think , Lee said , my father never had . He had a little ambition thrust upon him -- but he never set out to conquer the world . He was filled with wonder . Maybe the beginning of his ambition was when he began to photograph Fort Davis . He was never a Rebel . I think he had forgotten , if he ever knew , that Jeb Stuart and Lewis Armistead had done a tour of duty at the post . He made pictures of militia manoeuvres , bird 's eye views of the cavalry post and artillery post , old quarters built in 1858 , post chapels , McClellan avenue looking south toward the commandant'squarters , cavalry parade ground , Troop A Seventh Cavalry , Battery B 32nd light artillery , trooper under full pack , Colonel Joffray on his charger Sioux . He peddled them . He preserved many pompous martial stares . God help Tamerlane if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various rooms on Pawnee street and set his printing frames on platforms outside the windows . On the sidewalk he had glass cases of cavalrymen and farmers staring stonily at the mud-rutted emptiness of the main street across the wooden sidewalks . He had north skylights and sold campaign button reproductionsof loved ones . He became Harrington 's Art Gallery by 1894 , when his light fine hair had thinned ( from the focussing cloth , he thought ) , and he had pyro stained fingernails and a bristly moustache . Weems Johnson had built him a good north skylight in the second story of the building at Sixth and Pawnee streets and he could sit in the bay window of his reception room and look up and down the street at the buggies and wagons and threshing machines and troops of cavalry that went past  --  if he did not have a sitting . He had a fine Century camera stand , with rubber tires onp179its wheels , a set of canvas backgrounds , with flowers in garlands and marble columns painted on them , and reed posing chairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron ice tongs arrangement to hold babies , and a showcase full of Premo cameras , Hawkeye cameras and Eastman Kodaks . There was a cot behind the backgrounds next to his back room , where there were a few decollete art portraits of fine deepbreastedgirls who ended above the nipples in old tulle and artificial vignetting  --  and his mandolin and guitar . He now had three tailor made suits , ( not including his dress suit ) , a safety bicycle ( wheel ) and a small diamond stud for his shirt bosom . He loved to walk on the plain unpainted pine boards of his operating room floor and look at the Century camera and smell the dark room and think : Well , I 've done it now . Here it is . But he sometimes had his doubts.  |p180YES  ; he rented the gallery rooms . Robert knew they were not his , but there were all his things around him . His cameras and his lenses and most of his clothes and his guitar and mandolin were all at the gallery  --  even his dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything he saw now he thought of in terms of light and exposure  --  even the Fork City girls he danced with at parties  --  even the little white frame story-and-a-half cottage Father and he had built the year after they had come from North Carolina  --  even the girls on eleventh street whom he had often seen shopping in the Bee Hive for sporting house towels  --  even the fat girl who had given him the dose of clap that Doc Gaines had cured up for him . His gallery , his cameras , how the light fell on the world and how he could stop the light falling on the world and arrange and stop a moment and how he could work from the permanent base of his gallery where the north light fell on the pinewood floor and the Century camera and stand . He thought of this security as he paced back and forth slowly on the pine boards smoking a cigar and looking at the carbon bulb outside the red window of his dark room . He could go out from his place and come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the light was good . He could , with a long rubber tube , bring back his own image as he had from Chicago , when he went to the Worlds ' Fair in 1893 , brought back his photograph in a straw sailor hat sitting beside the young practicalnurse in a white high-collared shirtwaist with his moustaches waxed and pointed and his cloth-topped patent leather shoes dusty in the light of the park . He had brought in the fountains playing and women walking between the baroque buildings under umbrellas ; he had brought in the streets of Old Vienna with the actors in costume before the half timbered saloon  --  and he had brought in the waters of the lake.  |p181But  after that he had brought into the gallery negatives of the houses in North Carolina , the uncles and aunts and cousins and his sister Martha  --  dying even then  --  sitting brown faced and impassivein an old Morris chair on the porch of her husband , Dick Tyler 's home . He finished them , sent copies back to North Carolina and mounted up a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a pair of denim jeans before an unpainted shack , Linc Morris posing in a borrowed frock coat before a grist mill where icicles hung stiffly from the water shute , his , Robert 's , father 's store with corn still growing beside it . An old Negro or two . None of the houses had ever been painted  --  none of the people had ever had a suit as good as the three that hung in the closet of the dressingroomin the gallery . Uncle Pinckney stood with the egg-like growth behind his left ear  --  as if he were still at a rustic attention with the blanket roll of the Army of Northern Virginia over his shoulder , on the way to the village of Gettysburg , Pennsylvania . Uncle Daniel sat on the porch of what was so near a mountain cabin that no one could tell it was not . In Daniel 's eye there was a spiritual look , ' so people said  --  but when he held the print dripping under the skylight of the gallery in Kansas , he knew Uncle Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried and looked at the glossy merciless surfaces which were images of his childhood , he saw the lack of paint , the exhaustion , the creeping death which stalked in the Piedmont  --  and he was obscurely glad he had not photographed the boy with the groundhog in the sack on the road to Uncle Pink 's . As he looked at the gloss prints in the hypnotic Kansas sunlight , he thought : Sad ! Tch tch : I did n't remember it like that . The boards was n't as weathered and Uncle Pink was n't as old . Why it 's all rotten and damp down there  --  and Uncle Dan 's crazy as a loon . And Pink 's no ' count and shif'less . They 're all pore as Job 's turkey . I 'll never go back again . How was it I did n't remember ? How was it I thought Father 's house was big ? Even the pines and dogwood ! And the branch where Linc Morris and me use to fish is pore . So he looked at the Century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slanting glass  --  and looked at eachp182separate crack of the pinewood floor and the Kansas dust settling on the leather camera bellows and knew that he could never go back to live in the land of sadness in the hills . Here was home now ; here were the lens and ground glass and the focussing cloth . He went into his office ' , put his feet up on his untidy desk and lighted the stub of his cigar . It was the year 1897 : and he had to wear spectacles to retouch his negatives . He sat nodding in the Western summer afternoon . A new bicycle ? Another camera ? A trip ? Where was I ? Maybe a new suit ? He was bored  --  time was fading the brilliant print . Bob , Cornelia said , Mother wants you home to supper . There 's fried chicken and hot biscuit . Oh , hello Corna , Robert said . It 's almost six now , I 'll close the gallery and drive you home . I want you to meet a girl , Cornelia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was slim , and her neck was almost scrawny . Dark almost resentful eyes looked hard at him . A nice girl  --  a pretty girl . Purty , eh ? Robert said . Yes , Cornelia said . Her name is Nora Beckham . She 's a good girl too . She works at the Bee Hive . Oh , Robert said , I seen her . I have seen her , Cornelia said . Yeh , Robert said patiently . I have seen her . Robert remembered the face : straight little nose , dimples , a white peach bloom skin and full curved lips . He had seen her grow up . He remembered her honey-colored hair and her fine breasts . She 's got a lot of beaux , Cornelia said . Has she ? Robert said . Oh my , Nora was tired . She 'd been on her feet from seven o'clock and she 'd just got home and taken off her shoes and rubbed her feet . Even though she had got away from the Bee Hive at eight-thirty  --  and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked pale and drawn in the mirror . Papa was in the front yard pulling some weeds under the catalpa tree and he looked up and said : What 's the matter , Nora , honey ? You do n't look well . Oh , Papa , I 'm all right . Now you just go in and lie down , honey , Papa said . Do n't you do a thing . But Mamma was ironing and she had n't felt good lately , so Nora took off her shoes and rubbed her feet and put on her slippers and said to Mamma : Here , Mamma , just give me that iron . Butp183the doorbell rang , and Mamma said : Why , there 's the doorbell ! I wonder who that could be this time of night . Maybe it 's Auntie Carper just run over for a minute , Nora said . I 'll go to the door , Mamma said . In the hot kitchen , where the irons were heating on the cook stove , Nora could hear the strange voices . Mrs. Beckham ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion in her voice . Well , Mrs. Beckham , I 'm Cornelia Harrington  --  and this is my brother , Robert Harrington . How d'ye do ? Mamma said . Howdy , a man 's voice said , slackly . I know your daughter , Miss Nora Beckham  --  and my brother and I came to call . That photographer ! Nora thought . And that tall skinny sister of his , that school teacher  --  they do n't amount to a hilla beans.  |p184I  HAVE often thought , Lee said , that love of home in many of our contemporaries is a case of not knowing where else to go . My great great uncle returned from the green woods of Pennsylvania to die in smoke and fog and lint of Liverpool because he did not know where else to go . He must not have loved the foul place for he was a hatter and needs must truckle to the tastes and whims of not only the milords but those who , though they had money , were not even gentry by the King 's letters patent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is my home , and I love it . These American taverns can not compare to the public house on the corner  --  and I ca n't stand the way these bloody people speak through their ruddy noses . And not only that , Lee said , thoughtfully . They come back to Fork City , Kansas . They spend the first sixty years of their lives in a place which has been stuck in the eternal mud and dust and wrapped all around so tightly with the earth of a continent that it takes several decades for a new idea to filter through to the people and several more decades for them to decide whether or not the new idea ( which is old then ) is sinful or not . They spend their lives working for a living and living that living in the future  --  and then they come back after six months from Miami or Long Beach saying : Well , it 's just fine there , but home 's best after all . There 's no place like Fork City . Oh yes , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's the beach and that lovely cemetery , but it just is n't Kansas . It ca n't compare with Kanuss and besides all my friends are here . But even that does n't do ; the grocery is sold , the law office closed , the farm leased  --  and there is nothing to do even where they spent the fine I'll-never-forget days of their youth . Now , they have no home at all . No home but the carefully bought cemetery lot , which the small vultures of the town cemetery corporation sold to them saying : It is always a good thingp185to be prepared for the passing of loved ones ; you must think of raising a memorial to their names ; you will get perpetual care for so little more ; the deed will go on to your children  --  and they will thank you for it . Ah , there you are , Brother Doakes , when you go up there on the hill , they spread out a little green artificial lawn around your basement and they turn out for certain fees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you down on the smoothworking pulleys into your lot . Then , praise God , you need n't worry any more . You own the lot ; you 've got perpetual care ; your name ( this can be managed most reasonably ) will be on your house ; and then , Brother , you are home . You need n't worry about getting on the West or Southbound Flyer anymore  --  not about the termites , or water getting into the basement of that tropical bungalow , or whether the man at the meat counter in the corner market does n't cut a pot roast the way you did in the shop you sold back home  --  let alone the Goddamn ' funny way he talks that makes you hate his guts so and would even if he did n't overcharge you . No ; you are home . Remember ? At Jim Carling 's funeral you thought that pome that Reverent Horseley spoke was , when you come right down to it , purty Goddamn ' nice  --  more truth than portrey . An ' you said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home from the sea and the hunter home on the hill . Yes , yes , when you build on that lot up there on Cemetery hill , Brother , you 're home . You can go home that way , Lee said , and most do . But I contend and that most affectionately and ardently , that home is a maggot in the brain of man , a trick done with the mirrors and double-exposures of the brain , the image of a blonde young whore in the wistful twilight . Home is a collection of things you never ( lid have and can not ever have ; home is in a book which tells of things you would not want if you saw them . Home is a phrase spoken by a sweetvoiced stranger you never saw on a fine summer night long ago . Home is the place you build in the dream before you go to sleep . And , Lee said sadly , although I hate to say it nakedly , home is a sensation which seats itself in the bowels and genitals . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm sunlight , on a Kansas rock , feels as if he were home again for an instant . Andp186it is with this thought in mind that often I have stricken him down in his prime , that he might die with Home , Sweet Home ringing in his heart . Home is what the young girl said as she lay back on the grass in the moonlight , her thighs apart . Therefore , we come to the comfortless conclusion that home is a confusion and can be had only for a few moments here and there , without reference to either the rockbound coast of Maine or the sunny shores of California . To the romantic adventurer , the rough professional soldier , the diamond-in-the-rough sourdough , the ancient salt , home is where he hangs his hat . This is a portable , notable and worthy sentiment . For me , I say home is a page in a book : as a waffle eaten and forever gone in a street in Manayunk , Philadelphia ; a halfdrunk night in St. Louis spent with people who are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house on Third street , Fork City , Kansas , when it was raining and the drops jumped up like soldiers marching in the serial of war that I was reading in The American Boy ; home is how Christa 's cheek felt against mine in Forest Park one night in July ; and it is the whistle of a big long-engined mountain train at night . Fah ! Lee said . It is useless to talk about it , for nothing will ever get us home . Better to be a snail or a tortoise , who carries his home on his back . Better to be the rat , of whom it is said , that , even if he be a tame house rat for the best years of his life , you have but to drop him in the middle of the Gobi and he instantly becomes a desert rat  --  or throw him into the Amazon , the Mississippior the Orinoco and upon the moment his paws hit the water he becomes a river rat . Home is no worry to a rat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saddest sort of gibbering , for the cemetery corporation have long had a monopoly on the home . Home is where I hang my grave.  |p187SISTER  AQUINAS was kinder than ever to me in my last year at Catholic school . Before I knew it , it was spring and I was in the graduating play . It was The Shrine in the Glade , and I was to play the hero , Alexis , and John Roamer was the Prince and Vee Crump was the Princess . There was one happening , however , during that year which I was always to remember with a twinge of shame . I missed two months of school because of my lung . I was kept inside at home during the cold weather and I spat up the reddish-brown phlegm which nauseated me as it came from my lips . Sister Aquinas sent my assignments to the house and I tried to do some of them . When I went back to school , Sister was nice to me and I learned perhaps half of what I should have learned . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my grade card , a month after my absence , Papa gave me a dollar to take to Sister for my tuition for that month . But Papa , I said , there 's three months due . Well , Papa said , you were n't in school two of them . But , everybody pays the same whether they stay home or not , Papa . Now , son , Papa said , money do n't grow on trees . You take the dollar to Sister Aquinas . Yes , Mamma said , she do n't expect any more . I took the dollar to Sister at recess . Why , Lee , Sister said , I thought you owed us three dollars . I felt my face get hot ; I was n't even a Catholic . No , Sister , I said , I was out of school two months . But Lee , she said , as if she did n't understand , everyone else always gives us the money whether they 're in school or not . That 's all we have.  |p188I  was near crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that I was out of school andShe must have seen my embarrassment , for she said : There , Lee . It 's all right ; do n't you worry ! I went outside to the playground , my face burning . I never forgot . Two dollars was a bigger sum to me at that time , but even then , it seemed not so much to give Sister Aquinas for my tuition . And when I came to realize what a little bit it was , I always felt my face get hot and shame in a greater degree than I felt that day at recess . I never said anything more to Papa and Mamma about it , for I wanted to forget it . There was a war in Europe . Somebody murdered a Grand Duke . There were pictures of the gallant Sikh regiments , who used razor-like rings which they carried on their turbans , in the London Illustrated News that Captain Chickering , the retired sea captain friend of Grandpa 's , used to bring to Grandpa . I saw the pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rape of little Belgium . And I heard Papa talking about the Alleys  --  that was the way he pronounced Allies  --  having another victory . Sitting in Sister Aquinas ' room one afternoon , I was told that the United States had declared war on Germany . But it was only when they began building Camp Ogden , to train American soldiers for the war in France , that I thought of the war as anything approaching a reality . The Culler Construction company got the contract to build the army cantonment , and the construction companyhired Papa to make pictures of the work in progress . Papa bought a big new camera which , with all its attachments , lived in three cases . It used huge rolls of film just like Kodak films . He took me out with him in the Overland automobile to the rimrocked hills around the camp site . I helped to set up the new camera and played with the little fan wheels and the brass wingboltsof the miraculous machine from Rochester , New York . It was the first camera like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the crest of the hill overlooking Pawnee Flats of the Shejaw river valley , Papa said : Now then Lee , you fetch that little case over here to Papa , and you and me ' 11 make a picture , wo n't we ?  |p189Yes  , Papa , I said , lugging the case over to Papa . Down in the valley trucks were unloading lumber , men were walking around and I could hear the far-off grind of a concretemixer . They looked as small as the people I had seen from the top of the ferris wheel in Philadelphia , but in the sunny , warm Kansas morning , standing on top of the rimrock with Papa , the long buffalo grass all around us , they seemed something which was supposed to be there . Now , you stand over to that side of the camery , Papa said to me . Farther over ! There ! Now you just stand there until Papa tells you to move . Papa aimed the lens at me and got under the focussing-cloth and worked the knob on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cloth , the always-thinning central tuft of his hair standing on end . He smiled . Now stand still , Son , and do n't squint ! he shouted . And batyerizeatimertwo . Stand still until Papa tells you what to do . I stood still , batted my eyes , and tried not to squint . Papa pressed the bulb and the big , new circuit camera started rolling its eye over the Shejaw river valley , its little fanwheel spinning . The eye rolled away from me , seeming slowly to slice off a vision of the valley . I stood watching , fascinated by the life of the machine . Now , Papa yelled , run around back of the camery over to the other side  --  over there ! Hurry up ! Papa grinned shyly . Now , right there , son ! Turn around and look at the camery ! I turned , and slowly the eye of the machine rolled away from the valley and pointed to me . Papa pressed the bulb ; the eye closed and stopped . I ran to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture . I 'm on both ends of the picture , I screamed . Papa chuckled quietly . Now do n't say anything about it to your Mamma until we show her , he said . She 'll think you got a twin brother , heh ? I helped Papa put the new camera in its cases , and together we walked down to the Overland on the road below , which was then still a quiet dusty unpaved Kansas road.  |p190You  and me 'll fool Mamma , wo n't we ? Papa said . The next day Papa brought the picture home , and I saw myselfstanding knee-deep in weeds squinting , at either end of a four foot picture of the site of Camp Ogden , Kansas . Mamma looked at it and said : My , son , you and Papa are just too smart , taking your picture twice all at once  --  or are there two of you , Sonnybug ? Mamma put the picture away in the belly of Poor Yorick in the house on Third street , and once when I was home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at either end of a slice of Kansas Valley where thousands of men were trained for death and mutilation . More and more people came to Fork City  --  and Mamma and Grandma took roomers in their houses . Grandma and Grandpa now lived right across the driveway from our house . They called renting rooms **61;2666;TOOLONG , but they charged good rental prices . One day I was standing on Grandma 's porch when a soldier and a woman with honey-colored hair walked up the street and turned in at Grandma 's house . There was a pink rose in the woman 's hair , and she looked soft and white and bright redlipped . We 're just married , the soldier told Grandma , standing pigeontoesin his too-big army shoes . Oh , my ! said Grandma smiling . Well , I do n't know whether I can let you have a room or not . I 've already got two young men from the Culler construction company Oh please ! the soldier said , just for a while , lady . We tried everywhere , and someone told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Grandma said , seeing you 're a bride and groom , I might fix up the front room for a while . The woman did n't say anything , but she smiled slowly at Grandma and then she looked at me and smiled again with her bright soft red lips . They went in to look at the room and I felt myself trembling with a queer feeling . When they came out Grandpa was with them , and he was saying : And , by God , if I was a young man , I 'd shoulder a musketp191again myself and march out against those Goddamned Huns . I was wounded in the battle of Gaines 's Mill  --  forty-oddNow , Beckham , Grandma said , ah  --  ah ! You be quiet . The soldier said : Well , I have to get back to the barracks , Mrs. Beckham  --  and thank you . He kissed the woman and walked away down Third street . Would you like to go to your room now , Mrs. Johnson ? Grandma asked . The woman smiled slowly again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care , I think I 'll stand here a minute . She turned and put her hand on my shoulder . My , what a nice boy . He 's my grandson , Grandma said . He lives next door . The woman 's hand remained for a moment on my shoulder and she said : He 's handsome . I felt a sweet sickness , and I wanted to get closer to the woman . Jesus H. God , Grandpa said under his breath.  |p192Wagnal  knew alreadyIT WAS the Reverend Dr. Wagnal , D. D. , the not quite unfrocked priest , who had been a regimental surgeon in the Civil War and was then the Village Madman , who fumbling through his old photographs in his boxcar house one day , found a copy of a photographmy father had made of Laura Webster . It was a bust picture of cabinet size . Laura 's fine breasts showed just enough under the ambiguous cloud of dusty tulle , clasped by artificial roses ( the set of property gear which I had seen , dusty from many female powders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing-room for many years ) . Her shoulders too were well-filled , and , though small , athletic . The face had sloe eyes looking up from the downbenthead , with a sprig of dark hair fallen carelessly , as if in play , say in an orchard , almost over the right one . And the distended doelike nostrils , caught there in my father 's photograph , caught there in her youth in Wagnal 's old white hand . I could feel the same nostalgia for her that I felt for all the gallant pretty dashing girls I had known . Wagnal pointed his swollen caverniculous nose and looked at the photograph until a great tear splashed on the edge of the cabinet mounting . This , Wagnal said , was as fine a figure of a young woman  --  as finely bred a girl as you would find in a year 's shuffle through the international lights o ' love and belles of the world . You could search the demi-monde of Paris and Vienna with all the most earnest rakes for guides and find nothing half as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality , as if to serve you was her greatest wish . Many 's the time have I looked down at her from the pulpit , God forgive me , with the feelings that you , young sir , know as well as I. I should have loved , then and there , simply to have taken her to bed . I now have no need to beg any forgiveness , he said his voice deepening to a low roar , for I am no longer addledp193by such beliefs . And , even though I was not young then , I know I could have had Laura . For once in the vestry , I , as if inadvertently , laid my hand upon her long thigh  --  and she trembled like a lyre in the wind and smiled . It was a spring night , warm and full of lilacs  --  and had not Katherine whom I loved been alive , I should have bedded Laura . It has always remained a mystery to me , how such a high-spirited girl grew up as the daughter of a prairie ironmonger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster must have adopted somebody 's noble bastard in the Old Country , but perhaps she was only a mutation , a thing that occurs once in a century of common stock . I do n't know  --  but I shall mourn to my dying day not having had her . Good God , boy , that was it , she just missed being your mother . Now , mind you , Nora Beckham was a beautiful woman , much more beautiful and sought after than Laura . But Laura had not that quality in her that made Nora take life in her hands and bend it like a twig in her direction  --  or , if it would not bend , snap it off the tree . Nora bent the twig all right . It was that indomitable pride and will of your mother 's that did it . She was the one who wanted to go away from this Goddamned dull little Babylon and cut her name on the earth  --  not Laura . Laura only wanted to marry your father , Robert Harrington . The afternoon it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Laura and Nora were working at the Bee Hive  --  and you can wager that Nora saw to it that Laura knew  --  Laura came into the church . How she knew I was there , I do not know . We had no confession . I did not believe that anyone could ask to penetrate another 's privacy , for God or anybody else . She had not come to the church , she had come to me . She was a little paler than usual , but calm ; and she came up to me in the chancel and touched my hand which lay on the railing . She did n't say anything . She did n't even look up at me for a moment and then she tossed her head slightly and holding it slightly to one side with a wonderful shy , childlike dignity , she looked me full in the eye . Then she laid her head on my breast for a moment with a little movement like an affectionate cat , and looked into my eyes again.  |p194She  had made it plain : She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had closed the door in her face . And Nora Beckham , who could have got along as well with almost anybody as with your father , had taken him only to drag what few fine feathers Laura had in the dirt . So it was that Laura came to me . And boy , if I had come then to the wisdom I have now , I would have taken her in an instant  --  for Katherine would not have known . And now I would not have any regrets . But I let the catalytic moment pass . She sat down in a pew and said : Robert Harrington and Nora Beckham are engaged . You know already . Yes , I know already , Wagnal said . He began to weep casually , the great tears falling and splashingon the tusks of his yellow-white moustache and on the mussed unironed unfresh shirt ( the striped madras castoff of a former parishioner ) . And as he wept , he heaved up his great body , his wenlike belly flapping slackly . The boards of Amity Prentiss 's former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goblets and whiskey jug from a walnut sideboard with a cracked marble top . Cracked , he said in a roar , setting the goblets down on the marble , like me . Why he said , young sir , I have as fine a mind as ever Mr. Emerson had  --  nay , if it comes to that , I fear no one but William Shakespeare himself and him only South Southwest , for he was never up at either University  --  and do n't you forget , sir , I am a surgeon of Yale and Baltimore and Edinburgh . If I cared to set my hand to it I could show the Bard of Avon , provincial that he was , in his true light  --  but who would knowHe held the goblet in his great hand and looked into the sunlight coming from the large window ( it must have been the Prentiss girl 's studio , for the skylight window could never have been in a caravan or a boxcar ) . You know , before they seized upon some of my peccadilloes  --  my innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass , Christmas day , Eighteen hundred and ninety-six . Only four years and the old century was gone  --  eaten up by the gluttony of time and death . His Eminence Giovanni Cardinal Vincento lifted his white glove with the ring of Ecclesiam and made signs above the rabble of St. Peter 's . Hisp195eyes were vacant ; and what cared he for them who stood beneath him ? All he cared was that the red hat lay somewhere locked in an ironbound chest of his  --  and that perhaps one day if he played his politics right , he would wear the papal crown . He repeated the Latin as if he were already in Paradise , looking down upon us who were unspeakable , untouchable , and who stank to high heaven . But for all that , Wagnal said , I stood there awestruck in The Eternal City . He was still weeping and as he raised his goblet , Lee said , the tears splashed into the cheap whiskey . Now , he said , where were we ? That is another thing  --  that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they took me away to that place , I cannotkeep my thoughts in continuity , that also is why I shall not challenge the Bard , sir . Where were we ? Miss Webster  --  Laura Webster ? Lee said . Ah yes , he said , a blank slyness coming into his eyes , A fine actress  --  something of a young Duse . But it was before that , I said . She came to the church . By the body of Christ , boy , who told you that ? No one has any call upon the secrets of that poor broken-girl . I thought then , Lee said , that I would have to leave and quickly too , for his butcher knife was lying on the cabinet beside the whiskey jug  --  and I could not tell whether he was staring at it or staring at nothing . And , anyway , it was about three o'clock in the afternoon of a mild sunny January day ; and here was I sitting with a senile and murderous madman doing nothing to further the ends of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town and throughout the earth a furious ambitious activity , which would advance them in the eyes of a blind ghost called Posterity , was being carried on by millions . They were getting on , while I marked time with a crazy defrocked village priest in the abandoned backyardstudio of a no-longer young lady artist . I sat there in frustrationand fear , watching his blank stare , his now roseate monumentalnose with the unheeded seeds of black dirt in the pores , doing nothing , for I was so paralyzed by the feeling of futility , which had , so to speak , like a monster leapt off his shoulder and landed flabbily upon mine , that I doubt that I could have moved ,  |p196had  he put the knife to my throat as people said he had to the organ-pumping boy years ago . But he turned gentle again and compassionate : Yes , he said , yes , I remember the highbred nose and her wild dark eyes : Laura Webster was a rare creature . She came to me and said , now , Mr. Wagnal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I to do ? And I answered her like the hyprocritical old ninny I was : There , there , my child  --  there , there , Laura , dear , God moves in a mysterious way I said that  --  when what was in my heart was as plain as the communion goblet in my hand . You can not think of the aged as ever being anything but aged . But that had nothing to do with their taking me away into that place , that house with the dark transepts and corridors where the foul Dane took my clothes away  --  and I must needs urinate in the corners of my room . I wandered all day naked  --  and when he had the temerity to pinch me  --  weak though I was , sir , I almost killed him . After that they locked me up in the dark without even a blanket where I could not sleep for years . I am a natural insomniac  --  all I could do was walk about in the dark and repeat what I remembered of the bones , muscles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anatomy schools in Edinburgh , what I knew of the Bible and Shakespeare and The Book of CommonPrayer and all the poets I knew . That passage from Twelfth Night , or What You Will how I hate it : Sweet are the uses of adversity ! Pah ! They are not  --  they are foul wakeful darkness and cavernous boredom . I repeated everything I knew and composed something in the vein of Kublai Khan which would have been great could I ever recall it . But after a while I began to be bothered and taunted by the naked strumpets they sent into the dark room . Beautiful Babylonianwhores they were and crafty as hell itself  --  not like poor Red Mary in Edinburgh . I could never get near them , though I was in a continual state of priapism which must have been most attractive to them ; and I dived headlong into the dark corners where they lurked teasing . Then , for a long time , I thought of Laura Webster and mep197as Laura and Petrarch  --  but I could not call up to memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , I thought of the Pompeiian temples and bagnios side by side . Then there were nights when I was troubled by Sir John Suckling 's deformed mistress , and I loved her most horrible ugly self : Where am I now ? Here I should stride , lest I fall in , the place must be so wide . And I thought of the battle of Shiloh and your great-grandfather Captain Hanks . Wagnal had begun to sweat a little from the whiskey and his old lackfocus eyes burned . I could smell the oldman smell again . He was wheezing and sibilant like an ancient retired and abandoned Don who still hung about the college gates . My son , he said  --  young sir , Christ would have it that all men are brothers  --  the first having been got in sin  --  and the first and all the rest stemming from a common origin of lechery . It could well be , it is possible  --  for all men are enemies the one to the other and self to self . All men cut their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explode in a warm mulch of decay and finally bring themselves forth again as sperm in a warm gruel shot off in a passion.  |p198Why  Laura Webster went awayYEs , I said to him , it is too bad to think of . Bad ? Wagnal said , his old voice low now and tired with despair . I do not really know , sir . Life is horrific and painful  --  but as to bad . Consult the word book , but use the word . It is a good enough word , bad : It was bad that for days on end I languished in the foul dark , because I tried to persuade an organ-pumping boy to pump properly  --  or because I wore a rose behind my ear or between my teeth instead of in my buttonhole . These innocent embroideries which I superimposed upon the deadly humdrum of Fork City lent tone to the deadly place . Every sensitive man in the town was trying secretly to kill himself with drink  --  and among the duller souls there were a great many cases of the religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was willing to die for love . She did not , however , die : In that day , the picture shows , the jerky phantoms of our dull dreams had not quite crowded the live actors from Fork City . I remember the name of the company and the woman : The Gaby Lester Repertoire company . Gaby Lester  --  about a fourth rate actress . A flashy woman , big-busted , green-eyed and painted , who carried a longhandled summer propertyparasol in the streets of Fork City in midwinter 1899 . She looked like a woman in one of the Moulin Rouge paintings by the Count Toulouse-Lautrec . It was during this period that the local men began to subscribe to the Opera House fund  --  and then , though it seems hard to believe , Fork City went to the theatre in tails and evening gowns , such as they were . I believe , however , that there were no top hats . I can still see Gaby standing behind the Opera House footlights , a fiddle in her hands , singing , the spotlights lighting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spangles and making us in the audience believe , for the moment , that we werep199in Paris or Vienna at least . I can see , in front of the train of Gaby 's dress , the little chain looping its way across the very rim of the stage and light shining on its uprights . Maybe Gaby Lester really wanted a spool of thread , a remnant of silk or a piece of whalebone . Maybe she went into the Bee Hive store to study the rural clerks so she could incorporate them into one of her parts  --  or , perhaps she had seen Laura or Nora in the store and had gone in for the purpose which was finally clear . The beginning scene , I know ; it is still plain in my memory : It was a slack time in the afternoon . Several of the girls were standing beside the counter talking  --  your mother and Laura Webster were among them  --  when somebody spied Gaby coming along the walk . The excitement attendant upon the theatrical personality in a small town rose  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in here , I 'd like to wait on her . Huh , Nora said , that old show woman ! You can have her . They 're all loose company . Oh Nora , Laura said , they 're not all that way . I think she 's interesting . Let me wait on her . Well you 're just welcome , Nora said . I would n't spit on that old sort of thing  --  those kind of women . Oh , Nora ! Laura said . Gaby Lester had some charm  --  the variety of acted-out mannerswhich almost any show woman can put on . She was statuesque , carried her head high and her green eyes had , if she wished , a kind of electric warmth . She turned this on Laura , asked for the thread or the ribbon and smiled , pushing up a couple of dimples and moving a small black crescent-shaped beautypatch on her right cheek . The smile was charming and friendly , that Laura saw  --  but it had another quality in it which was not staginess , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had another tingling quality in it that seemed to be sincere  --  and was , no doubt , the sincerest thing about the woman . I do not suppose that Gaby was thirty then , but she was a fair actress when off stage she chose to play the grande dame to Laura 's lovely child ingenue . My dear , Gaby said in her low contraltovoice , letting its vibrant tones ride full and free , you are a very beautiful girl to be working in this store  --  and such a nice voice and style too . How nicely you wear your clothes.  |p200Laura  looked at her gravely with the up-angled look from her sloe-eyes and brushed aside the twig of dark hair from her forehead . Thank you , Miss . . . Lester , Gaby said . It is n't my real name , but I 've used it so long I 've almost forgotten the other one . Your mother , Wagnal said , pretended not to watch from the backend of the Bee Hive . But all the rest of the clerks gaped openly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thread and the ribbons . You can imagine the scene : the drab little store with its thread cabinet of drawers on the counter , the scarred counters themselves , the stools , with iron uprights and revolving seats screwed to the old pine flooring , for the farm-wife customers to sit on . Maybe there was still a gaslight above the counter and the whole picture flickered from reality to fantasy as the show woman graciously took the package from Laura and smiled . Good afternoon , my little beauty , she said . My little beauty , mind you . Laura 's head went down a little further and she blushed shyly and said evenly and gravely , Thank you . The actress then half-turned , and appearing to reconsider , faced Laura again . Were you ever interested in show business  --  the stage ? Why yes , as if undecided , Laura said , yes . Well then , Gaby said , why do n't you come backstage tomorrow night and see how we work  --  as my guest ? Why that 's nice of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gaby said , if you can . I 'll expect you , if you come . The next day , Wagnal said , your mother came to the store with the ring your father gave her . That afternoon Laura came to me at the church and I failed her . As she was walking out of the vestry door , it struck her that she was going to see Gaby that night . She thought about it all the time she was walking home to supper  --  although on the way home , Robert and Nora passed her , and she spoke absent-mindedly and refused a lift home in Robert 's buggy . At supper she puzzled her obtuse parents , for she was more grave and shy than usual  --  and poor old Burn Webster and his wife could get nothing from her . I do n't believe they ever knew anything about how she felt about Robert . And when she went out , bound for the Opera House , neither dared question her about where she was going , forp201I think they feared that something most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy gravity which hung around their daughter . She knocked on the stage door ; and Windy Decker ( he was n't old Windy Decker , the bill-poster , then ) let her in . Good evenin ' , Laura , he said . You want anything here ? It ai n't allowed to come back here . Good evening , Windy , Laura said . Miss Gaby Lester invited me to come behind the scenes . Oh well , Windy said , that 's differ'nt . She 's still in her dressin ' room . I 'll go knock on the door fer yuh . Careful yuh do n't stumble  --  it 's dark here . Nice big new stage ai n't it . Fine opper house . Windy knocked on the door with a silver radiator-paint star and several dozen show company names in pencil on it . He got a somewhat surly , What ? from inside . Someone to see yuh . Who is it ? Gaby said , still surly . A young lady , Windy said . Name of  --  Oh , Gaby 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura opened the door , and Gaby , seeming to be all fine white shoulders , sat dazzlingly in front of a blindingly lighted mirror . She smiled at Laura 's reflectionand said : Good evening , dear . So glad you came . Windy Decker stood there bemused and watched Gaby Lester get up from her seat in front of the mirror ( which was ringed around with some dozen-odd of those old fashioned electric light bulbs with visible wires strung through those porcelain non-conductorswhich for those days gave a very blaze of light ) and put her arms around the slender and shy Laura  --  as Laura stood a little stiffly as naturally a country girl would at a display of affectionwhich seemed to her profuse from what was hardly an acquaintance at all . Windy was still standing there all thumbs when Little Bilbee Lester , the husband of Miss Gabrielle Lester , a small man with thinning grayrat-colored hair whose nose was reddened both with greasepaint for the clown 's part he was to play that night and with the rye whiskey he had drunk at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brushed past him . Where the hell is my vest , Gab ? the husband said without looking at Laura or Windy . Gaby ( she had shortened her name from Gabrielle only ap202month later than a wanton French musical hall woman had shortened hers ) turned to him quietly and gave him a straight , long look without any expression . He stood still with his mouth open . Then she turned from him back to Laura and smiled , her redlips making a dazzle of her face : Miss  --  ? Webster , Laura said . Miss Webster , Gaby said in a low , level voice all sugar and charm , may I present my leading man and my husband , Mr. Wilbert Lester ? As she turned her head from Laura and pointed her eyes at Wilbert , her red smile closed away to a mysterious dignity . Oh , ex cues me , Wilbert said . I was unawares you had guests . Pleased to meet yuh , Miss Webster . Are you inna show bisnuss ? Oh , no , Laura said . Dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still in the low , level voice . She stepped over to a trunk pasted with bright scored hotel labels , theatre programs , and painted with The Gabrielle Lester Theatrical Repertoire Company and Gaby Lester company . She lifted the lid , and from a wallpaper-covered tray , lifted out a vest ( much too large for Bilbee ) of large bright red shepherd 's checks  --  the kind of garment which Laura had never seen before . As she handed it to her husband , she smiled again at Laura and said : It do n't look so loud from out front . Naw , Bilbee said , yuh got ta step it up tuh make the rubes  --  the audience think it 's sharp . Neither Laura nor Windy Decker saw Gaby 's face when she said , still in the low , level voice , Wilbert the curtain 's in three minutes . After which , she faced Windy Decker and smiled . Thank you very much , Gaby said to him . Oh , Windy bloody well knew what she meant , even if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been anywhere except two or three neighboring counties . He knew that he was supposed to get out and be damned quick about it . He went down under the stage muttering , twenty-three skidoo ! S'only seven-thirty , to himself . And that strange little encounter with Laura , whom he had known all his life but had never seen exactly as he saw her that night , and Gaby , who was , for him , a dazzling and beautiful actress from a place that was only an unknowable name to him such as New York , must have somewhat unstrung his oddfish sortp203of nature . For he had seen this little play in the dressingroom between the village girl and the actress in the scents of grease paint and Gaby 's rather brothel-like perfume . Nay , he had played in the scene , for he understood that he and Little Bilbee were supernumerariesin Fork City 's especial curtain-raiser to Gaby Lester 's main show . As he went downstairs  --  under the stage  --  where he was not supposed to be , for his duty was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went downstairs , perhaps then he began his attachment for the Fork City Opera House , which for years to come was his wife , mistress , father and mother . Indeed , Wagnal said , if I know Windy Decker he was not begot by a male and carried by a female in the regular way , but issued full grown from under the stage at Eighth and Osage streets , Fork City , Kansas . When he got downstairs in the dim lights of the basement , he was trembling with a kind of sweetsoft delight leftover in his head from the scene upstairs . He sat down on a nail keg , which the contractors had left after the rebuilding they had done after the fire . He sat there saying over to himself : She 's sure a beauty . I bet my bottom dollar , she can go some . And he did n't know what he meant . He did not mean Gaby , although he had craned his neck at his every chance to see her ; he did not mean Laura , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that she was most beautiful in a manner which he did not understand . Maybe he meant the Opera House itself ; but such a love could not be put into words . Therefore , Windy Decker only knew that he sat in the dark womb of the Fork City Opera House on a winter 's night of 1899 trembling with a delight to which he could not put a name . As Windy sat there , the iris lenses of his eyes opening to the dark , another thing happened : Little Bilbee came down the dark rough ladderlike steps with a woman who looked to be naked . She was slim  --  perhaps almost skinny but with ripe-ish breasts  --  and from the tilt of her head , she looked like the young girl with the dark eyes and corkscrew curls who patted his shoulder and smiled a promising smile when she came in thep204stage door . Windy began to tremble the more when the man led the girl over to the cot Windy slept on . Then , as he watched , the two sat down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggled . But Bilbeeee , he heard the girl say , it 's late and my tights  --  Rip ' em , Bilbee said . It wo n't show none with a pin . Besidesshe 's got the kid up there  --  and it 's only seven-thirty . The girl giggled again and Windy heard the small plucking sound of popped threads  --  and then he saw them tangled on his cot and heard the breathing and a giggle or two and the intense fast creaking of the little bed . After a while there was a soft groan and a puffblow of breaths and there was quiet . Finally there was the skinny , not unpleasant giggle of enjoyment from the skinny girl as she and Bilbee untangled . The girl giggled again a secret guilty-giggle . Now Bilbee said , you lay there a minit , kiddo . I 'll git upstairs before you git there  --  do n't want to be seen together too much . That was a good ' un , huh ? Yes , Pony said and giggled again . Windy watched Bilbee go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl was sitting on the side of the cot fumbling at the crotch of her legs . She lifted her head , sat up straighter , got up and with her head bent forward as if she were straining her eyes in the semidark walked slowly up to Windy , who still sat on the nail keg , trembling more than ever now in a kind of bewildering ecstasy . Pony 's nose stopped about six inches from his so that he could see the pleasant looseish pretty features and the corkscrew curls  --  and feel the nice warmth from her body . How long you been here ? she said in a scared harsh whisper . How long  --  I ai n't bin here long , Miss . Honest to Gand , I ai n't . I ai n't seen nothin ' . You ai n't seen nothin ' , huh ? Pony said , mocking poor Windy . Then she giggled . This astounded Windy more than any act this lank strumpet could have put on . It dumfounded him so much that he forgot himself and said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't see nothin ' . Pony reached over and put her hand in his hair . That 's fine , Funnyface , she said . Stick around after the show tonight and Auntie Pony 'll see that you get a little piece  --  of cake.  |p205Now  mark , boy , Wagnal said , stroking the tears off his yellowwhitemoustache as if it were a well-loved cat , the fates were brawling with the strings again , the strings in which you are still entangled , for it might have been Nora Beckham who went to the Opera House . But I think not . For as much as the great world beckoned to Nora , she could not have allied herself to the stage , which she believed to be infested with loose women as indeed it was and is  --  though of course , one hardly knows what a loose woman is . All women are loose except Katherine . The fact remains that Nora Beckham took the ring that your father gave her , with a simple , not-so-secret motive in her mind of putting Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded  --  and she catapulted Laura out of town and on the road to a fame which Laura had not wanted  --  and which was got in a way that is sometimes considered unsavory , although it is a thing which has puzzled me much and a thing about which I choose to reserve judgment . But this is the way things fell out : After the show that night , Windy watched Gabrielle Lester ( whose real name was perhaps Anna Jones ) kiss Laura Webster lightly on the cheek at the stagedoor and heard her say : You must come tomorrow night , darling : We 're going to play What Befell Smith  --  a complete change . Well , Laura said . Well  --  She caught up her skirt for it was long and there were things backstageit might catch on . You have such beautiful gestures . You catch up your dress like a great lady . You could be an artist  --  a great artist . Windy heard this . And in his simple forward way he spoke up : But Laura ai n't ever painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaby did nothing but turn slowly and look at him and then turn back to Laura , as if she had just brushed aside a bug . Well ,  |p206honey  , if you come tomorrow night , we 'll make you most welcome . Laura hurried out into Osage street and walked fast all the way home , for although it was Monday night , there were some soldiers on the street . When the stage door closed , leaving Gaby and Windy standing beside it in the weak light , they heard a dim giggle from somewhere on the dark stage . Gaby did not even frown , but looked directly at Windy with a blank stare which chilled him . She turned and walked into the dark of the stage . She did not lower her voice , for Windy heard it : Whatever you and Wilbert do , Miss Junkin , is all right with me . All I ask is that you do it out of my sight and do n't make damn ' fools of yourselves . She left Pony no time to answer  --  and Windy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company were all out of the Opera House , he shut the stage door and went down stairs . The light was on above his cot and Pony Junkin was half lying half sitting on it reading a copy of The Police Gazette . She was smoking a little gilt-tipped cigarette ; and beside the cot on a chair stood a flat pint of Old Krieger fiftycent whiskey . She had on only a pair of high button-shoes ( unbuttoned ) and a pink dressing-sacque . Windy , his loose joints going looser , began to tremble violently again . You ai n't supposed to smoke in here , Windy said . Fire  --  Pony just looked at him and giggled  --  then she winked and swung one of her unbuttoned high shoes off her foot at him . Windy tried to catch it but muffed it . Have a drink , Jakey , she said , and giggled again . She opened her dressing-sacque a little bit ; and Windy could see one of her tits standing up pinkly in the cool cellar air under the stage . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand there with his mouth open and stare for a moment  --  for he had never seen anything so wicked and wanton . She turned her loose red-painted grin on him and said : Well , Jakey , You 're pretty slow . C'm on an ' have a drink . My name ai n't Jakey , Windy said and tried to stroke his new moustache , which was not the fine handlebars you remember him wearing for he was Old Man Decker to you just as I am Old Man Wagnal to you , but a short one which was n't growing any too well then . Ah well , Pony said , whatever it is , Auntie Pony'sp207gonna give you a nice piece of cake . Come over here and Aunt Pony 'll give you a nice sugar titty . Now Windy was over twenty-one ; and I believe he 'd been down on Eleventh street to Morro Castle , but , at that time he was still shy , so he found himself arrested in his tracks , his eyes cast down . He was trembling . Pony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : So it was good , huh ? Well come over here , Funny Face , and have a drink . Mamma 's gon na give you a nice sugar titty . Pony 's gon na satisfy you . Thus it was that Windy walked trembling to Pony Dunkin underneath the stage of the rebuilt Opera House in the winter of 1899 , Wagnal said . It is true to say that Windy and Pony spent all night with Eros and Bacchus , for Windy emerged several times dressed only in his shoes , trousers and overcoat to buy the brute booze at the DePew Saloon and while he was out he talked wildly and most ungentlemanly of the nymph Pony who lay waiting impatiently for him to come back with the liquor . He even told Andy DePew that she had a pretty cute mole near her bellybutton . It served propriety very little , Wagnal said , a curious longago memory expression of compassion coming over his face , that Pony got up and dressed about dawn : and both of them walked over to the Pawnee House where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town marshal , who had the mistaken idea that Windy Decker was an Irishman , followed them to the hotel just to see they got there all right . And , Jim Gillis , the night clerk , heard Pony say to Windy : Pony sure did satisfy Jakey . Oh after Windy left her , he got back to the Opera House , all right . He almost crawled down the alley to Osage street and fell into the stage door which was on a spring . He was now , sir , completelyin the arms of an alcoholic Morpheus  --  and his bout with Venus had helped to clamp him there . Now , sir , Wagnal said , it is pathetic , but it is an interesting circumstance , that at noon of the next day , Windy came into Consciousness with a throbbing head , a stiff dry throat , and an almost frozen carcass which was being shaken . He looked up and saw Mlle. Gabrielle Lester 's face above him . Curtain  --  he said . He thought that it was still the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mlle. Lester said , you 'll get the curtain , my good man . It 'll go down on you once and for all , if you do n't get up and dress the stage for the rehearsal . A dizziness and vapors seized poor Windy 's head and he babbled the word , Pony . Ah , Gaby said , so that 's it , eh ? That hussy . She 's done it before  --  and she 'll do it again . Well , I 'll take care of her . You get up and set the stage and get the curtain up . I 'll talk to the management about you  --  you son of a bitch . Decker , Wagnal said , was robbed of all common sense and motherwit by the night 's debauch . He was a poor benighted lad and Pony was a simple somewhat evil creature , but there was no justice in what Mlle. Lester , the leading lady , said to him . He got the curtain up and the stage set  --  and the rehearsal of What Befell Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands shook and he jumped at every sharp and sudden sound . When Pony Junkin entered the Opera House late for rehearsal , still drunk or drunk anew with the **28;2729;TOOLONG , Windy turned his head aside and hung it down . Pony , poor nymph , was giggling banally as usual . And Mlle. Lester , Wagnal said sorrowfully , felt herself to be the avenging angel : You Junkin , she said from the front row , get out there and run through the Abbie lines . It is inexcusable to be late for rehearsal . Wilbert was standing near his wife  --  and he turned to expostulate : Now Gaby , she ai n't  --  Gabrielle did not even turn towards him but said in a calm voice : Look here , Lester . I do n't care if she 's your fancy woman as all of us know . But a Goddamn ' chippy like her will not hold up my rehearsals.  |p209Quite  legal and respectable as the blind beggar used to sayHam , sir , Wagnal said , pouring more whiskey into the communiongoblets , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixing into the past is like sniffing at a rocky altar where goats and virgin children were killed , with the stone knives , for the ubiquitous gods . He said this in his most ancient don 's voice ; and he was whistling on his sibilants again  --  the old man trying to get through the stout heedless wall of youth . And I sat there , Lee said , smiling in a fine fatuous blush of assurance . I knew what he meant : I knew what the word time meant . I thought , then , I could look a barefaced clock in the dial and shout down its barbarous ticks . But I did not know what time meant even to the Reverend Doctor Wagnal , D. D. , M. D. Since , I have found out somethingof what it meant to him  --  now I do not want to know any more of what it means to anybody . I am afraid . Still sibilant , after a large slopping gulp of the whiskey , Wagnalwent on with the story , like an ancient sorefooted horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So mark you , young Harrington , your fate had been in the balance , before you were a thought in your father 's heart . Your entrance upon the stage of a waiting world  --  and this ought to make you the more humble ,  --  was gravely entangled in the funguslike lives of Winston Decker , stage manager and bill poster of the Fork City Opera House , Pony Dunkin ( an unsuccessful chorus girl and whore because of a native skinniness ) and Mlle. Gabrielle Lester ( born Anna Jones in Cedar Grove , Iowa ) . It was most difficult for poor Windy . After Miss Lester complained , Avery Simmons , they called him Jump , lessee of the Opera House , called a meeting of the male members of the staff , before whom Windy appeared . It was like an inquisition . They had put chairs and a table in the foyer and Windy stood before them . Abel Gortz told him of the evils of rum ; Jump told him that the fire insurance on the theatre was insufficient and reminded him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for Windy to tell him that the fire engine was housed in the building ) ; a moral part-time tinsmith admonished and warned him of the evils of women had out of wedlock , especially those who smoked Turkish Trophies and left the burnt-out butts on the very floor around the very bed of illicit love . Gutter 's eyes burned with something more than righteous indignation against sin as he warned Decker of the wine of Venus  --  and he questioned his victim lovingly . It were better , Wagnal said , with old resigned regret , that Windy had got the sack . But no , they dragged the little dignity he had in the local dirt of rustic morality , docked him two weeks ' salary and let him stay with his love , the great Opera House of Fork City , on whose boards some players played who later became famous . Windy was caught . Oh , he tried to get away once , but he was caught . During the remainder of the week 's engagement , Pony Junkin could not make Windy look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any rancor at all . She stayed slightly drunk all the time  --  and contrived to step out with young Doctor Torrey and an army officer from Fort Davis . The janitor found Torrey 's waiting-room full of smashed glass and Turkish Trophy butts ; and , on the leather couch in the consulting room there was a pair of Pony 's bloomers . Meantime , Wagnal said , Gaby and company played What Befell Smith , The Henrietta and other pieces I can not remember  --  and , several nights later I saw Laura Webster sitting alone , a little behind one of the redplush draperies of a box , with a blush on her young face . When the week 's engagement of these earsplittingplayers had ended , Laura Webster was gone with them ; and Pony Junkin was stranded at the Pawnee House , drunk on part of the fifteen dollars which Mlle. Gabrielle Lester had given her in lieu of notice . And , all things being equal , you were scheduled in some few years to be born to Nora Beckham instead of Laura Webster.  |p211Therefore  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill-poster and an unsuccessful chorus girl turned strumpet to thank for the fact that you walk the earth  --  that you sit here with me today talking of the old and repetitious weathers and moods of the world . By the same token , your mother , Nora Beckham , had by a vain and idle thought , willed herself into the mischief and boredom of a town which was no longer the Wild and Golden West , but was fast shrinking into a village in the provinces , where everything is so decent and dull that it has , as you see and know , driven me , for one , mad . Madness , like virtue , is its own reward . Here , he held up the communion cup . Here 's to our reward , sir , he said , and swallowed the oily liquor in a great loose gulp . By this time , the fringe of Wagnal 's white-yellow hair was sticking out in ducktails , the cuffs of the limp madras shirt were hanging open like the lace of an old Eighteenth Century beau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor could I , he said as if taking up a dialogue with himself , have helped or hindered what happened . And why should I have cared except that my lovely shy Laura was gone ? And Katherine was gone to the arms of Stuart  --  the Chevalier on the church tablet . What remained , sir , was the poor carrion , the poor whited sepulchre Pony who began work at the Occidental house as a waitress and then as a paid harlot in the protection of Madam Belle at Morro Castle . Many 's the time I saw her on the street after that , and she spoke to me , respectful of the cloth . I believe the incident had no effect on her at all , for she was simple , daft as a small child , like Jamie in Edinburgh , and without shame . But when Windy Decker saw her in the street , he always ran as fast as he could and locked himself tightly under the stage in the Opera House . And , indeed , for weeks after his night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had picked up the French disease of love . FitzGerald finally gave him a bland ointmentwith which he anointed his father-implement  --  and Windy subsided into the life of semi-exile which you see him leading now . There is never any end to anything , Wagnal said . And mark you , sir , there was no end to this . Yes , Pony Junkin , the chippy ,  |p212went  away , for it was bruited about that Madam Belle would not tolerate the childlike and generous way she gave herself away to the customers ; nor did Pony 's habits with the bottle , and soon with Dr. Torrey 's beloved morphia , endear her to Belle , who was a practical , though moral and sentimental woman . Thus it was that poor Pony disappeared as if she had been a gay dirty little feather in the wind . Doubtless she died drunk in a bordello . God forfend that she died sober . Your mother and father were married by some eager Methodist or Unitarian parson whom I have forgotten . So , sir , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the blind beggar used to say . With that , Lee said , Wagnal began to shake his belly with giganticand drunken laughter  --  after which he tapered off into a comparatively quiet sobbing .. .  |p213Now  , Lee said to the dark ale , as he watched the sun diminish and the dark soundless chatter of light behind the bar dim down , we shall drink up and examine The Odds . Something was awry . Robert Lee Harrington , the younger , was about to begin his dryrun for the Battle of Life . He was about to Take Up Something  --  about to be made into a Useful Citizen , about to be told how to wear a Respectable Blueserge Suit to his doom .. . Myohmy , Nora said , son I ca n't understand you . I just wish I 'd had your chance to Be Somebody . Do n't be a stick-in-the-mud . You can do anything if you try . Why , if I 'd a-gone to college , you bet I 'd sure hold up my head and be in the swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't put any more of that foolishnessthrough your head , just march right up to them and hold up your head and look them in the eye and say I 'm Lee Harrington from Fork City , Kansas . Have some gumption ! Do n't waste your time like that old Dee Given and Breezy Gortz ! You can amount to something if you want to  --  if you do n't soldier around . With these spinestilening words clanging in my ears , as and this I do to save you from the gallows must have clanged in Samuel Johnson 's , I was taken to the university to see what dirty doom I had made for myself . In answer the ale gurgled past his vocal cords , smugly.  |p214The  buffet to the bullsheadTHE bus was cheaper than a taxi . My face burning with shame , I sat on the hot imitation leather seat , worn rumpsmooth by many students , drummers and townspeople . I dreaded this as much as I had hated the privy into which my tin sword had gone . The Model T Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its frame , coughed along the uneven bricks of Mississippi street , grinding and skreeking as the driver pedaled its transmission into a grudging show of power , jerky and petulant . A knot of summer co-eds ( probably schoolteachers ) giggled emptily on the hot brick sidewalk under the withering maples , looked idly at the bus . I scowled , blushed and glared at Mamma . Now , son , do n't show off , she said through her teeth as she looked sideways at a small fat man with pop eyes , who sat sweating , dreamily bored over some sample cases . I did n't say anything . I scowled harder . The girls on the curb giggled again . My mother hissed at me . A bus ! I said . Son , my mother said , clamping her lips , I do n't know what 's the matter with your head . We just have n't got money to throw away . It do n't grow on trees . Your Papa and I never went to college . The bus stopped and the three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Papa as they were getting down from the hot bus into the street where the afternoon air hung like an invisible dryfog . Then I thought , no , that wo n't do . Mother and Dad are better  --  the other is n't manly . Papa looked roundshouldered and tired in the gray alpaca summer suit full of stiff summer wrinkles and the short billed checkered golf cap he was wearing over his baldscalp , where he had hardly any Sunny Jim hair now . He had on a blue striped madras shirt with a stiff collar two sizes too big already wilting on it . From the gold collar/button which anchored the collar there hung awry a hook-on readytied black bow tie . Nora 's polka dot dress looked cheap and tacky , I thought . The hard hot August light fell on the collegiate suit which Nora and Bob had bought for me at Kohnstam 's , the best clothing store in Fork City . That and the stylish brogue shoes I was wearingseemed now to me to look as if they had come out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smalltown in Kansas  --  as indeed they had . For now these clothes , hot and soggy with August sweat , had left none of the aura of the Latest Thing which they had when Mr. Charley Carter hauled them off the rack and repeated , Nice worsted ! Nice worsted ! over and over again . Nora fiddled in her artcraft leather purse and came up with a letter which she turned over in her hand . Eight , four , five , Manila street , she said , holding the envelope up and off from her bifocals . This here 's Miss'ssippi , Papa said tiredly looking up at the bleak streetsign . The Kansas sirocco vaguely rattled the leaves of some cottonwoods and blistered along the other trees and graybrownparkings of Mississippi street . I did n't speak , but I knew my face was set in grim discontent . I could n't help it . Now , Son , Nora said . You stop being bullheaded and showing off . I want you to distinkly understand I wo n't have it . Your Papa and I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get settled . And what do you do ? You stick out your lips and act like a bull . You sulk around . I still did not break the silence , but clenched my teeth harder and put my bull 's head a little further forward . A bent man in washfaded overalls and a frayed out sweatgreasy tencent strawhat came along stumbling slightly . Whur 's Manila ? Papa said . Eh ? The man said . Manila ? Papa said . Manila ? Hah ! the man said and pointed . Much obliged , Papa said . Looks like Whurry Coffy . What ? Nora said . Nothin ' , Papa said . It 's this way , Son , Nora said . Come on , Bob . And now Lee , I want you to straighten up and quit showing off , or you ca n't go to college at all.  | Papa stumbled a little on the brick sidewalk where we were walking with Mamma marching along upright , a little in the lead . C'm on Son , Papa said . Do what yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick walk so that nobody could see me  --  or that Mamma and Papa did n't look so much like rustics . Those girls at the curbside were laughing at me because of the way they , Mamma and Papa , looked , Above Nora 's gullwinged upper lip there hung bright hot droplets shining a little in the slantlight of the afternoon . She tossed her head like a small spirited mare as she looked at the number on the houses . She dabbed at the droplets and settled the hair at the back of her neck . Now , she said , hardly opening her mouth to let out a hissing whisper , now , here it is Son . You straighten your self up and quit showing off and try to be somebody . I clamped my jaw shut the harder . You make me so mad , Nora went on in the hissing whisper , that I could just take your head off . My God ! I said softly . And do n't you mouthe to yourself , Nora said , I wo n't have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I nor your Papa ever went to college . Eight-four-five Manila was a tan-yellow frame house . It had a tall slim bleak appearance , on one side , though it was only two stories or a story-and-a-half in the lumberyard terminology of the day . I looked at the dismal lap-siding boards of the place , feeling as if I wanted to cry . The front door had a plain oval glass in it it was not even as interesting as the harpwoman . Papa , feeling perhaps that he had to make a show of forwardingthis pageant of entry into a seat of learning , walked in his springless fashion up onto the porch and pushed at the rusty door bell , from whose plate small veins of rust had run over the gray of the door frame . We stood waiting like three abashed birds . The boy was tall and skinny with light-colored limp hair and buck teeth . He had on a faded gray shirt and blue overalls . He looked at us , raising his eyebrows slightly , which somehow affected a mole on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . Nora was now in front of the door , and Papa was at her left ,  |p217standing  slouchily , his cap still on , his cigarstub in his hand . I was behind my mother , my sailor straw hat held awkwardly in my hand . The heat gripped me as if it were a wooly straitjacket . Is the lady of the house in ? Mamma said . No ; grandma  --  grandmother ai n't in . Howdoyoudo ? Mamma said . I 'm Mrs. Harrington . I wrote her a letter about a room for my son , Lee . I just brought him down to get him settled in college . Oh yeh , the boy said , the mole going up and down as it moistened with a drop of sweat . Well , she ai n't here now . I 'm Harold Kranz . She 's my grandma  --  grandmother . Mr. Kranz this is Mr. Harrington , Nora said . Howdy , Mr. Kranz , Papa said , clumsily taking off his cap shyly and causing the few Sunny Jim hairs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from under the focussing-cloth . Yes , Nora said again . I brought my son down to see that he was in good hands when he went to college . Are you in K. U. ? I now thought of my head as a bull 's head in some superrealitywith doubled horns and a thick vicious viscid glare  --  and I felt my lower lip sticking out more and more . It was as if Mamma had said : I 'm just putting this young bull to pasture , Harold . Can we just see the room , Mr. Kranz ? Myohmy , is n't it hot ? Nora chirped in her meeting-the-public-voice . Harold 's shiny forelock fell across a watery blue eye as he led us upstairs . The room was clean in a barren bleak way . In the hot August afternoon light it gave off an infernal aspect of heat and cold at once . From the iron bedstead to the dresser and over the bare student 's table , I looked out the bay window to the somnolent sizzling air around the gray trunked maples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrant , its pipe carved in fluted ornamental castiron , its top a four leaf clover . On one side of the wet grassy spot the bright green moss flourished . Shadowed and cool . For a moment my heat mesmerized eyes resting on the hydrant made me think not of home but of a feeling of my childhood as I had stood beside such a cool hydrant in Grandfather Beckham 's old yard near the stable where Grandma Beckham said the old Irishmanbeat the little pony to make her good.  | Why , Mamma said as if in astonishment , it 's awfully clean ! It 's elegunt . Is n't it , Papa  --  is n't it , Bob ? Yuh , Papa said . Fine . How do you like it , Son ? Mamma said . All right , I said , my voice back from the oasis of memory in Grandpa Beckham 's backyard . And my wary bull 's head went down again . Ah  --  , Mamma said , is the house all modern , Mr. Kranz ? Huh ? Oh yeh ! Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and mothergrim , turned on me , a storm rising within her . The words came through her teeth : If you do n't stop this showing off , I just do n't know what I 'll do to you  --  I could just take your head off  --  I could slap you to sleep ! I watched the ominous air-stretching sentence stretch to its period without breaking . Now , Son , Papa said , straighten up , Yer Mamma'n me  --  The bathroom 's this way , Kranz said . Oh , Muhmm , Mamma said . Thank you . Come along , Son . I expect you know all about these college boys , Mr. Kranz . Mamma smiled falsely for the Kranzface . Naw , Harold said . I just come on the Hill . Excuse me ? Mamma said . I just enrolled . There was a blue black enamel-less spot or two on the tub in the bathroom silence . The throneseat was down spewing the yellowingshade of Cloacina 's colors . On an oilcloth covered shelf lay the bathroom minutiae of bristle-clogged toothbrushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what a nice big bathroom ! Mamma said . It 's elegunt , is n't it , Son ? Yeh , I said . As we walked out of the bathroom , a greenfly buzzed through the silence and the privy that held my rusted tin sword came back to my mind . And why , I thought , when I 'm about to go to college should I think of my dead sword rusted away in the dung ? We straggled downstairs , and standing in the awkward silencep219of the greenfly , Mamma said : And what are your terms , Mr. Kranz ? Well , Harold said , we got hot air heat  --  Oh yes , Mamma said , you have a hot air , have n't you ? We have a hot water at home . Well , Harold said , Grandma said that 'll be about twenty dollars a month . Well , Mamma said , my , oh my ! Oh well , we 'll pay a month 's rent in advance , she finished off magnificently . Lee will be here a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be quite aw right , Harold Kranz said , pushing his yellow buckteeth forward in the falseface of a smile . We left Kranz 's face grinning in the doorway and began the walk up the bumpy brick sidewalk to the college hill : Mamma , Papa , Lee . We straggled , I still sulking , my bull 's head forward . All three were silent until we reached the corner of Fifth and Mississippi . An old brick house with an iron fence built perhaps the spring after Appomattox , was witness to what happened : We three stopped in the hot afternoon . Further up Mississippi toward Mount Oread lay a wet mirage on the bricks . A Douglas County farmer clopped past the three in a broken-down spring wagon , a girl in white moved through the dusty shafts of sunlight on the opposite side of the street . Nora Beckham Harrington turned her eyes to the scowl on the face of her son . Son , will you quit showing off ? I do n't know what I 'm going to do with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  you 're doing what you wanted to do , you 're going to college . I could just take your head off when you look at me in that bullheadedway . Myohmy ! My head bent farther forward , bullwise . I could again feel the horns springing from it . Ohhh , Mamma said through her teeth , hissing . I saw the hand draw back ; the muscles of my back and neck tightened . I set the face of the bull more firmly on my face ; my heart savoured of the bull-headed look.  | Buliwack ! The hot summer afternoon silence said . The bull 's check of Lee Harrington stung . The tear-feeling rose to my throat and eyes . The blood of embarrassment and shame shot to my bull 's head , but I did n't let my bull 's lip tremble or let the tears come to my eyes . In these respects the bull 's head triumphed briefly over Nora Beckham 's eternal triumph . Now , Mamma , Papa said , Now , Nora . Mamma 's lip trembled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what 'll ever become of you , Son ! Her voice trembled over a quivering underlip , as she dabbed at her eyes with her handkerchief . Myohmy ! Yes , I thought , what will become of me.  |p121I  thought of my father again and the hypo keg full of hypo crystals ; it sat in the corner of the darkened printing-room , beside the pipe frame of an old homemade enlarging machine . I thought of the scoop in it  --  a cheap little fireplace coalshovel with the handle knocked og . I could hear my father saying : Here , son , we 'll fix those jiggers . Papa 'll fix ' em with some hypo . He would take a little brown Eastman Kodak Company Pyro bottle and wash it out in the sink where the prints were washed , put some of the white crystals in it , run some water over them and shake the bottle . Papa 'll fix those jiggers . I could see the back room of the studio , with the cardstock all around it , the long cheesecloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole behind the door with the low north window behind the two walnut retouching stands which looked like the tops of hansomcabs in the illustrations to Sherlock Holmes , the big tray in the sink in which the water ran all the time there were prints washing , the double south windows , outside of which was a platform on big iron brackets where printing frames were laid to print the proofs , the long table with the big knifed print-trimmer on it , and the clippings of the St. Louis World 's fair pasted on the wall above the workcounter , where my father had pasted them after he had brought them from the wall of another building a block away where he had pasted them when he came back from St. Louis . One was about a traveling man who died there that year  --  the year of the fair  --  in the Planter 's Hotel . I remembered that my father had gone there in Nineteen four to see the Fair and that in the studio there had been pictures he had taken of Forest Park  --  and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the tent of a photographicsupply house . And there was one of him standing on the steps of a house  --  maybe one of those cheap boarding houses on Delmar boulevard now.  |p122I  know how he looked then ; but then he did not know how I would look nor that I would ever be in St. Louis . And he would be dead and years buried in Upland Cemetery on a hill outside Fork City , Kansas . He had had himself photographed outside Tony Faust 's restauranton the fairgrounds ; and he sent Mamma a wooden postcard , signed Elm-ira Woods , per Robert . He snapped pictures of the people : women in long skirts and carrying parasols against the sun in front of a pasteboard Bavarian Alp . And maybe he drank a bottle of Budweiser . And girlswomen  --  hemay have bought a drink for one at the Fair . He may have gone to her hotel . He may have walked with her at night in Forest Park . He was only a little older then than I was now . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent on a papier-mdche posing chair , his long mustache curling ( not a Chester Conklin then ) his black Stetson off on his knee ( or maybe it was a sailor straw ) showing his baldhead , his Shriner 's button glittering in the lapel of his blue serge suit . My mother stayed home because I was only just born  --  or I was only just due to be born . He might even have picked up a whore , or walked into a house when he heard taps on windows like those in Olive street.  |p223The  Temple of HealthTim whole thing started up in Abilene when he was working for Old Man Swinton making coffins . Somebody had come into town with a six foot seven stick and wanted an oak box that long . It was one of those big Duffy boys outside Chapman who had died of apoplexy in the wheat field . It had taken Robert a good day 's work to make the box , and thought he , as he leant over to plane the boards : by Jolly ! I bet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licker than anybody ever saw around here before . And he planed and sawed and hammered the boards he had measured from the six foot seven stick for the Duffy boy 's coffin . Once he went to a wake where they tried to take the corpse for his last walk at three in the morning . It was when he was hefting it off the trestle , that he felt the sting in his belly . Ever since the building of the big Duffy boy 's coffin there had been the catch in his belly . And as he walked about the floor of his studio , his bald head under the focussing-cloth of the big Century camera , looking at the inverted images in the ground glass , he had , throughout the years of developer and flashlight powder , felt the old twinge and remembered the Duffy boy 's coffin . But he had photographed another generation of Duffy boys after that , looking at their whiskey-fierce , young Roman Catholic jowls inverted in the ground glass and sharpening up their illfitting Sunday clothes with little twists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Century camera . It seemed to him that , if he had recorded the miles he had walked , his head under the black cowl of the focussing-cloth , they would be millions . But now with this spring coming slowly after the bitter attack of the Kansas winter , with the boy in college , the debt paid off the building , he could relax and think of Gadkin county and Linc Morris and fishing in the branch and the green hills of his North Carolina youth and the sourwood honey and old Colonel Landseer 's place on the Hickory road with the boxwood hedges in front of the tall columns and how he , Robert , carried the mail past Blowing Rock at night on the haunted road . And he could sit and remember now how he had alighted from the train in Abilene with fifteen cents in his pocket and a great bewilderment in his heart . Then there were the years of coffins , the years of carpentering , the years of the focussing-cloth and developer and the years of his fine clothes and bicycles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix my belly and I 'll take a train back to Gadkin county and hunt up Linc Morris and go down to the branch and up to Blowin ' Rock and eat some sourwood honey . He saw himself moving backwards to his youth through the fabulousdistance of time and over the long rails through St. Louis and Knoxville to the Piedmont ; and getting up from his chair in the office of Harrington 's Studio ( Photographs That Please , Fort Davis Views a Specialty , Photo 's at Night ) , he walked out into the hallway and into Doc Yenser 's office . Doc himself emerged noisily from his dispensary , pounding a long shapeless yokel on the back . Now do n't you worry a bit , Jake . By God , we 'll have you as good as new here in a week or two . You just tell that old woman of yours to take good care of you , ( here he poked Jake bawdily in the ribs and Jake guffawed ) Jake , and everything 's gon na be finer'n frog hair split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take that medicine Doctor Yenser gave you  --  and be careful of that prostatic condition . And , Doc followed the yokel to the door , hammering more heartily on the big twisted back as they neared the parting . Jake , Goddamnit lay off that corn licker . Whohoho , whohohoho , whohohoho ! Doc finished with hearty man-to-man laughter . Tank you , Doc , Jake said weakly , for so big a man , and clasped the small prescription blank , as if it were a prayer paper , in the great hoof-like hand . Hullo , Bob , Hullo ! Doc said . You know old Jake Lindblom ai n't got a Goddamn ' thing wrong with him except he drinks too Goddamn ' much corn whiskey . Well , the Temple of Health 'll take his money and give him a few pills . Hell , why not ? Might as well get his money as FitzGerald . Only difference is FitzGerald 'd give him another drink of corn licker and tell him what a hell of a finep225farmer he is  --  that Goddamned old dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the color of his money is any different from anybody else 's . Well , Robert , how the hell are yuh , anyway  --  how the hell are yuh ? Doc laid a heavy hand on Robert 's shoulder . Come in , boy  --  come into the Temple of Health and sit down ! How the hell are yuh ? Oh , pretty good , Doc  --  pretty good ! Thas fine ! Thas fine ! Doc bellowed . Say , been hearin ' things about that boy of yours . He 's down to Lawrence at the university , ainty ? Yeh , Robert said , wishing to God Doc was n't so friendly all the time except when his rent came due . Well , well , well , thas mighty fine . Well , my boy ai n't old enough to go to college and run around with the gals and git his pecker wet yet . But pretty soon I 'll have to be watchin ' out for him . Whohoho  --  whohohoho  --  whohoho ! Doc went into a typhoon of laughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind his suspender strap , do you remember that operation we was talkin ' about  --  the one on my belly ? Well , I kinda been thinkin ' about goin ' back home to see the kinfolks in North Carolina , an ' I wanted to ask you how long it would take and how much it would cost . Kinda git a twinge in my belly now'n again , and I would n't wanta make the trip that way . Hum  --  humm  --  hummmm , Doc said , with an air of deep medicalmystery , his whooping voice changing suddenly to the dark , bland ritual of Aesculapius . Well , Bob , tell you what I 'll do , I 'll fix that belly of yours and you wo n't be on your back more'n a week  --  and it 'll cost you only one hunderd dollars . I usually charge a hunderd an ' fifty for a job like that , but seein ' it 's you , Bob , by God , the Temple of Health 'll make a new man of you for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doc , that 's pretty steep with the boy in college and money as tight as it is . Well , lookee here , Bob , how long you been walkin ' around with that rupture in your belly ? Huh ? Huh ? I du n no , Robert said , musing back through the years . I du n no , but I kinda think  --   |p226You  du n no , but you kinda think , mimicked Doc Yenser . Man walkin ' around with a hole torn through his belly big enough to drive a spring wagon through with a family of niggers in , and he kinda thinks  --  Jeezus Christ ! Well , Doc , Robert said , smiling weakly , I kinda think it was up in Abilene when I was makin ' a coffin for that big Duffy boy  --  you know that family Duffy 's lives outside of Chapman yet ? Yeh , yeh , I know the mackerel-snappin ' bastards . They all go up to FitzGerald and he feeds ' em whiskey and tells ' em what a great man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , anyway , Robert went on , I caught a-holt of that heavy oak coffin and tried to heft it off the trustles , and I got a twinge in my belly  --  I felt it off and on ever since . Up in Abilene , makin ' a coffin ! My God , man  --  my God ! How many years ago did you say that was ? Makin ' a coffin ! With **29;2759;TOOLONG , Doc Yenser shook his head and looked Robert up and down . Jeezus , that 's the way people take care of theirself ! You musta been twenty  --  how old were you ? I do n't rightly remember , Robert said , feeling a little shamefast , that he had neglected himself so long . I guess I was older'n that though , Doc . Guess you was older'n that ! Jeezus Christ ! It 's a wonder that belly of yours has n't dropped everything it 's got inside it on the floor long ago . That big Duffy boy ! Boy ! Why , that old son of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped dead from drinkin ' too much bad licker ! Come in here , Bob , and let 's take a look at that belly of yours ! Doc herded Robert into his dispensary ( he called it that ) , a room loaded with papier mache skeletons , real skeletons , skulls , bones , Philippine Bolos , African shields , rusty instruments and an old-fashioned osteopath 's rubbing table . Now take down your pants and lay down , Bob . That 's all right , he added lewdly , you 're safe ! Robert slipped his developer-brown thumbs under his suspendersand pulled them from his rounded shoulders , unhitched thehook and buttons on his fly and climbed awkwardly to the table . Hummm-hummm-hummmmmn , Doc said as he unbuttonedp227Robert 's long cotton underwear . Where 'd you get these Goddamn ' John L. Sullivan B.V.D. 's ? We 'll see , we 'll see what 's the matter with this belly of yours . You know , by God , Robert , I was down in Mexico once and along come a great big hulk of a guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to there , he drew a set fingertip across Robert 's abdomen . Whohoho  --  whohoho  --  whohoho ! he laughed . You know , Bob , that big son of a bitch had walked over to my hotel from the saloon , holdin ' in his guts ! They told me about it later , Doc 's voice grew low , dramatic and confidential . He 'd been standin ' there with his foot on the rail all evening abusin ' a little bit of a guy , and ever'body 'd had pretty Goddamn ' much to drink , an ' he kep ' callin ' the little guy seventeen differnt kinds of a son of a bitch , and , Doc paused ominously , relishing his climax , finally the little fellah decides he ai n't goin ' to put up with it any longer , so just as quiet as you please , he takes out a sharp penknife from his pocket and sticks it in the big fellah 's belly like that an , whoosh ! Doc drew the wet cold finger across Robert 's abdominal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near dropped out on the floor . An ' I 'll be Goddamned if he did n't gether ' em in with his hands and walk over to my hotel . Just sew me up , Doc , he says , not payin ' a Goddamn ' bit of attention to the blood runnin ' down his pants . And Bob , Doc 's voice grew quiet and tensely dramatic again , that big son of a bitch set there and watched me take a hunderd and thirty-nine stitches in his belly after we 'd stuffed his insides back in . That takes guts ! Whohoho  --  whohoho  --  whohohoho ! Humm , hummmn , hummmn , Doc 's fingers prodded Robert 's coffin-ruptured abdomen . Hurt ? Hurt ? Hurt ? Hurt there ? Hurt there ? There ? There ? There ? Ah hah ! That 's got it , eh ? Cough ! I thought so  --  I thought so ! Well , my God , man , you mean to tell me you been walkin ' around and pushin ' that Goddamned camera around for thirty-five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what with that belly ? I do n't hardly think it 's been that long , Doc , Robert said apologetically . And it ai n't hurt me much , except now'n again  --  you know , kinda takes spells . Ever wear a truss ? Doc asked sharply , professionally.  | Nope . Well , it does beat hell , it just beats hell , Doc said , shaking his head . Yes , sir it just beats hell . I 'll be Goddamned if I can see how you do it . Bob , tell you what 'll do : I 'll make you a price of seventy-five dollars to fix that belly of yours  --  and by God , you ought a have it done right away , say next week ! Well , I do n't think I can next weekYou do n't think you can next week ! Oh my God ! Doc shouted in mock despair . He do n't think he can next week ! Whohohowhohoho  --  whohohoho ! do n't think he can next week ! Well , anotherthirty-five years of walkin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of niggers and it wo n't make a hell of a lot of difference whether you have it done next week or not . Well , I 'll have to speak to the missus , Robert said tentatively , pulling up his suspenders . He felt a little worried , although he knew Doc was prone to act the windbag . All right , Bob ! All right ! You speak to Mrs. Harrington and let me know . But the sooner the quicker , as the fellah says , eh ? You ca n't go around with a belly like that , even if you have done it for the last forty years . Doc opened the door of the dispensary , pawing Robert 's shoulder as he ushered him over the threshold . As he pawed he saw , with satisfaction , that his waiting room was not empty , for there sat a venereal negress and a farmer with a pregnant , wind-dried , be-calicoed wife . Well , well , well , well ! Doc bellowed to the farmer . How are you folks ? To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Yenser , Loolo ; these folks have got an appointment ! And , Bob , let me know ! he said to Robert 's retreating stoop shoulders . And remember what I told you about another fifty years ! Robert , as he left Doc Yenser 's office in the Harrington Studio Building put his hand on the coffin-ruptured belly , frowned and clamped his lips . He was tired . Why , I moved lotsa coffins and lifted heavy things after that and I never felt it often . Doc 's full of hot air . Nevertheless , he was worried . He would speak to Nora about it that night when she drove the Buick down to the studio to bring him home . And anyway , Doc Yenser was n't such a good doctor . Robertp229knew that he was an epileptic . Indeed , it was one of Fork City 's open secrets that he was an epileptic and a clap doctor . His standing as a physician was questionable , for the school which had given him a degree in medicine and surgery was near to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practice long before the state had made laws against schools like his . But the other doctors did n't want his patients  --  and anyway , he was n't such a bad sort of a fellow , and he 'd been in Fork City a long time . So they sent him cases of gonorrhea and syphilis and now and again he sent them cases which frightened him by their obscurity . This was how Doc Yenser remained a practicing member of Aesculapius 's noble callingin the town of Fork City , Kansas . It was through habit that the Older Citizens and Nice People had come to regard him as almost one of them . And although Robert had thought that Doc was a windbag and not such a good doctor , he also thought that Doc had been in the north room and paid his rent ever since Doc Hopping , the dentist , had shot a bill-collector with a derringer and moved to Kansas City . It was in this way that Robert 's coffin-ruptured belly led him to his own coffin . It was in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century ago , in his youth , turned out in the end , with the aid of an epileptic clap doctor , to be the beginning of his own coffin . And this is why he never saw Linc Morris again , nor stood beside the branch in Gadkin county , nor tasted sourwood honey , nor saw again the green hills of his North Carolina youth . Nora sat in the Buick and looked idly at Robert 's showcase full of photographs as she waited for him to come down the steps from the studio . He will come down in a little while , she thought , and he will be all over developer and needing a shave . Now when Papa was in the picture business , even when he used wet plates like that Mr. O'Brady , the Civil War man , used he did n't get so messed up as Robert . Thinking of Papa brought back the image of Pawnee street as it had been , and she saw herself as she was at twenty walking past that other Gallery ( Whose was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden sidewalk , carefully avoiding the eyes of any soldier who might be drunk in the street and Robert standing under the old porch roof , that he and old John Swinton ,  |p230the  Abilene coffin-maker , had built above the entrance to his old Gallery , when he , Robert , had bought it . It was not long after that that Wilfrid left  --  that must have been in 1895  --  that she saw Robert standing beside the showcase of his first Gallery , he having just sealed the collodion arrested images of the Great Indian Fighter , General J. M. Joffray , Commandant of Fort Davis , Kansas , a local decollete , Doctor FitzGerald , and Laura Webster , that old actress , under the same glass . Even now she could see the gold wire epaulettes , the bald head , the long cavalry moustachiosof the General alongside the face of Laura Webster , who had worked beside her in the Bee Hive . And she thought , oh my ! but Dr. FitzGerald 's aged . These last few years he 's gray as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after she left with that Rubinsky Brothers show ? Or was it that Gaby woman ? Oh , I was pretty then , but I never thought I 'd marry Robert . Robert shuffled down the stairs looking indecisively behind him at the worn rubber matting . He gained the sidewalk , looked , unseeing , past Nora twice . She hit the electric horn button on the top of the steering wheel with the palm of her hand . Robert fixed her with a worried blue eye and plodded to the car . Hello , Nora , Robert said . Robert , what 's the matter ? Nothin ' much , he said . You drive , Mamma . You look like something had happened , Robert . What 's the matter ? Oh , nothin '  --  only I went in to see Doc Yenser about that place on my stummack today , an ' he 's goin ' to charge me seventy-five dollars to fix it , ifRobert ! That old Doc Yenser ! I do n't care if he is in the building . I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't got a bit of principle . You do n't know what might happen to you . Why , he does n't do a thing but doctor niggers and bad diseases , and you know it . Every old trash goes up there to Doc Yenser 's when they 've got something the matter with them they should n't have ! Now , Nora , Doc Yenser 's all right . Robert said , not believing it fully himself . And besides , this ai n't a very big operation . He canA MUSEUM OF HOME LIFE 231p231do it all right . It wo n't take me long to git over it , and , he paused with vacillation in his voice , I was thinkin ' , Nora , that you and me and Lee 'd take a trip back to North Carolina and see the folks . Nora forgot about the operation . But Robert , she said , do you think we can afford it with Lee in school down to K. U. and everything ? Well , Nora , I think we can . I wanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Line Morris . But I wanta git rid of this catch in my belly first . Oh , Robert , say stummack . Well , I do n't like the idea of that Old Doc Yenser cuttin ' on you , Robert . I just tell you he has n't got one single principle . Nora talked on about Doc Yenser and his lack of principle until she drove the Buick into the driveway of the house on Third street . Well , Robert said , getting out of the Buick , we 'll see about it in the mornin ' .  |p232I  HAD been sitting on the porch ; and the members had , perhaps because of my shyness , overlooked me . I was n't asked to join . Perhaps it was the shyness ; perhaps it was because my father did n't have enough money ; perhaps they knew , through a herdlike instinct that I was not really one of them . For they were to be the country bankers , lawyers , doctors , storekeepers , newspaper men of towns like Fork City , men whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a thousand Colyums of Social Doings . And they would own a thousand cars in the medium-priced field and smoke cigars and drive West to go fishing and see the filmstudios and East to see Times Square and the skyscrapers . And they would slap a thousand backs at the Elks Club Saturday night and drink a thousand drinks of bootleg liquor . And a few of them would get into trouble with Another Woman . And they would all be Successes with a Goddamned capital S  --  in a small to medium-priced way . They would all be plain as a mother-in-law joke or an old shoe . But there I was , unasked to join this fraternity  --  unasked to join any ( oh , I joined one later )  --  on the porch as the night on College Hill cracked out with the adolescent tribal yells of all the fraternities , yelling for their novice tribesmen . They spewed from the door , chins thrust forward , slapping each other 's backs and shaking each other 's hands . They screamed something like : Bloo-bloo , bloo-bloo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NoolWe ai n't put together with no Goddamn ' gloolWhile they were yelling nobody saw me . And I was such a faceless shy wretch that I could do nothing but sit struckdumb with shame and embarrassment . I had not made a fraternity  --  andp233what was more , there I was unpledged in the middle of the pledging . I had n't even the nerve to sneak in the house , get my hat and coat and sneak away . All over the Hill , the tribal babel was ruining the September night . Presently a tall blackhaired boy in a pepperandsalt tweed suit with bellbottomed trousers saw me and turned , with a slight frown , to a companion . I did n't hear him say : Why the hell did n't you get rid of that guy ? but he must have said something of that kidney . There I was unwanted  --  and I knew it finally . After a while , however , the black haired boy , one Candle Power , came over and , to give the devil his due , said kindly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here like this . We voted on you  --  and you  --  uhmissedit by just one vote . Awful sorry . Oh , I said with creaking awkwardness , my foolish heart sagging , that 's all right . Thanks . Can I take you somewhere ? Power said . His voice was cool and the night was now chilly . Well , I said , I 've got a coat and hat inside  --  Powerwas quick . I 'll get ' em , he said . I know where they are . Wait a minute . Hey , Knucks and Jim , you got a car ? I should have walked away from that house . He stuffed me into my coat , just as a chilly autumn drizzle began to fall . I hoped my face would not give me away for the failure and fool that I felt myself to be . I hoped that I could get inside the room at the Kranz house before my emotions broke . We got into the car , a new touring-car with side curtains . Knucks , a great blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too was wearing a tweed suit with leather buttons . The bricks on Louisiana street were already shiny in the rain . I told Power the Kranz address . As a generous afterthought , he asked me if I 'd like to go down to Gorham 's , the College hangout , for a coke . No , thanks , I said . I guess I 'll have to go write that letter home . I was quoting from the Freshman 's Handbook , which had a section in it called , Do n't Break the Home Ties . I was trying to be funny . They took it seriously . Yeh , Power said . S ' good idea . Looks like it 's gon na rain for the beginning of school again . The car finally came to the Kranz house , and for an instant ,   I glumly watched the fine fall rain falling in the beam of the headlights . I said thanks and good night . G ' night , Power said . See yuh on the Hill . Yeh , g ' night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . I was lucky that there was no one around . I got in the room , just as my lower lip began to tremble . A sharp sob came out of my throat and I felt the wet heat of tears in my eyes . Of course , I was a fool . Who gives a damn what bloody club a man belongs to . But of course , the things still exist . I belong to one myself . That night I did write to Nora  --  a brew of heart broken slop about not making her proud of me by making a good fraternity . She had never said anything about fraternities . After I had written , I lay awake a long time listening to the cold rain , feeling the circles of tears under my eyes . The rain increased . I could hear the drive and beat of it on the roof . Inside my skull , behind my eyes , I could see sheets of water blowing over the shingles above me . I could hear the rush downwardof the water through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is snug tonight ? Not I. Dee Given and Breezy Gortz had joined fraternities  --  and Melba Keylinger and Wilmia Farmer would doubtless find a tribe . But here I was alone . I thought of the bus ride in August and the laughs of the summer co-eds and heard Nora saying again : You straighten yourselfup and quit showing off and try to be somebody ! Well , by God , she and the Goddamned fraternities almost had me convinced that I 'd never be anything . I was , of course , only a worm 's worth of self-pity  --  but who , indeed , were these people to pass on me ? Even now I can remember , with shame and disgust , that rainy night . That I should even have thought that to be an outcastfrom this breed was anything but an honor . Years later I used to wake , in unknown beds in dismal rooms of my life , to remember with dismal grief , 845 Manila street , Lawrence , Kansas . I used to wake talking to myself . I was n't told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why should I be whipped ? Why was I so abject and footling that I allowed these foolish herds to trample down my pride ? P235Well , Lee said , the rains stopped and the weeds grew greener between the bricks of the sidewalks and around the Victorian ironwork fences in Manila street . I healed a little , though sourly . It was Indian Summer . The ground had only begun to dry after the opening semester rains . I was standing on the porch of the Kranz house with a few books in my hand , perhaps like a sad wounded bird , looking up at a maple tree with only a feeling  --  no thought at all . I had just come from a class room where the sun was dying slantwise , and a short plumping man named Door , in a slicktight blue serge suit , which he had bought in his freshman year because it would wear well ( it had ) , hold its press , and was conservative enough , i.e. dull enough , for him to stand in before his classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat , he sat cautiously and when he stood , he looked a Phiz illustration of one of Dickens ' more unpleasant and humorless characters . He had chubby curledback fingers with which he held a packet of file cards , to which he referred constantly and daintily . He had a worthy and pedantic manner , as if he must have worked his way through college at unpleasant jobs  --  perhaps such as washing dishes at a fraternity house to which he did not belong or pressing pants in a pressing club . He stood in front of us , as the shafts of the Indian Summer bounced illtimed off the onearmed deskchairs , and declaimed in a flat voice about John Adams , while he fumbled nervously with the rubber band around the file cards in his stubby stagefrightened fingers . I did not feel that I cared a damn for learning about John Adams  --  not from his lips . And I do n't believe he cared a damn . He just wanted another blue serge suit and to call himself Professor Door . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preacher or a pious farmer . The lecture slid out of my mind as a prairie road slides past a window ; and I walked down College Hill , my feet slapping against the bricks , looking at a lazy world of sunlight and shadow and leaves . Only a few students were in Mississippi street and , according to the mood of the day , they were quiet . So I stood there on the porch in Manila for a little while with no time around to bother me . Time was still lying in wait for me . I was in a dumb trance . Even the fraternity herds did not worry me . I did n't even hear the slap-slap of the low-heeled oxfords with the fringed tongues when the voice said : Hello . Light and bright it was . The girl was smiling , and she had her hands in the pockets of a red jacket . Her hair was a breeze stirred redgold . She had freckles and her eyes were blue  --  and squinted a little in the low sun . She stopped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up through the brick sidewalk . She looked like a young flower , its stalk blowing mildly in the wind  --  firm and clean and pretty , a thing that you sit and contemplate in your own garden in the cool of the evening . You wonder if you will pick it tonight or never . I remember the moment , Lee said . She was still smiling . Are you on the Hill ? she said . Yes , I said . I 'm a freshman . Well , she said , I live next door . I 'm a soph'more  --  or almost . What 're you takin ' on the Hill ? Everybody asked me that . For a second I could n't remember  --  I could hardly remember from one class to the next . I felt my face looking stupid . Oh , I said . Rhetoric , English Lit , Physiology , Spanish and  --  uh  --  History . It did n't matter . It was one of those stockstupid questions , a gesture much in the same category as when two ants , passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , stop to rub antenna ' against antenna . ' . Perhaps the ' nessage is only , I 'm here , see me and/or is it peace , war or love ? I looked at the girl and began immediately to have hopes and fantasies . Well , she said , my name 's Wyn Horner , and I live next door . Come over sometime . I 'm only a freshman , I said like an oaf . You would n't feel itbeneath your dignity to go out with a freshman , would you ? ' Course not , Wyn said . Everybody 's a freshman once . Where you from ? I said . Oh just a little town in Minnesota  --  Appleby . Why are n't you at Minnesota ? I said . I was last year , but I flunked out . Too many parties , Wyn said . I was one of the Beauty Queens there . What 's that ? I said . P237Oh , that 's one of the typical Minnesota girls they pick out to have their picture in the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an honor , is n't it ? Oh , I don ' know . Lotta campus politics . But she looked proud . You did n't tell me your name Oh , I said , Harrington  --  Lee Harrington . Say maybe we could go to a show or something tonight ? Maybe I could come to see you tonight ? Sure , Wyn said , why not ? That night I bathed for half an hour and pasted my hair down with some odoriferous muck . My hands were wet with the sweat of excitement . People should spend their Goddamned adolescence inside a well-controlled seedpod and break out of it only when they are tested for non-obnoxiousness with a meter for the purpose . Men and women look and act worse than new hatched chicks when they reach the time when they hanker to rub against each other and begin to babble about romance and dangle themselves around a peaceful horizon , like tumbleweeds . They should all breed and that quickly , that they may not scratch , gooch , pinch , yowl , tickle , erupt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our thoroughfares , with the idea that these demonstrations are romantic and dashing . I say let ' em all go to bed  --  but let ' em not conceive , for we are plagued with too many pinfeathers in this world . But God ! I even rehearsed . I was going to call Wyn , Babe , and be offhand and collegiate ! Harold Kranz leered at me as I went out the door  --  and this gave me a curious feeling that I was somethingetiolated emerging from underneath a rock . But Wyn must have had a true and healthy instinct for knowingthe rutting male and how to approach and get along with him on a simple animal footing . I rang and stood trembling in the cool Autumn darkness of Manila street . I did n't know much . It 's as simple as this : All these Goddamned people were here when Wyn and I were born . They were hypocritical and , when asked a question , could only look wise . I had a hell of a time finding out what they meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was the little boy was trying to do to her behind the lilac bush back in Appleby , Minnesota , before he knew . P238She came to the door and smiled . Then she just said , Hello  --  nothing else for a little while . I said , Good evening stiltedly , forgetting the rehearsal . She sat down in the swing . It 's a fine night , is n't it ? Wo n't you siddown ? I sat down , trying not to sit too near or too far from her but just the right distance to show I was a sophisticate  --  My God , I did n't know the simple essential motions which were all that could be expected of me . I trembled with shynessin the presence of Wyn from Appleby , Minnesota . And Christ , if I saw her now , I do n't think I 'd want even to sit near her for a moment on a cool evening porchswing . Dee Given or Breezy Gortz would have known  --  but I had to complicate a simple situationuntil it grew into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like K. U. ? she said . I should have said , Sure . What the hell ! It 's all right . But Icame up with something about just missing going to Yale . You did ? Wyn said . Why 'd you wan na go there ? Oh , I do n't know , I said mysteriously . I just sort of liked the idea of Yale . You knowUh-huh , Wyn said . She must have wondered what the hell an innocent like me would do there . Meantime I was thinking how I 'd show those fraternity guys . Those guys who had turned me down : Maybe a sport 's suit with leather buttons and one of those Bearcat roadsters that made a hell of a lot of noise with the cutout shut or open . Then they 'd want me to join their clubs and I would n't , by God . I do n't belong to any fraternity  --  I suppose you know that , I said this in a quick blurt , defiantly . No , Wyn said , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Phi Alpha pledge at Minnesota , but I flunked out there and I have n't even been to the house here  --  they have n't asked me . Sometimes I wish I was back there though . We use ' to have a lotta good times . She sighed a little , albeit comfortably and moved over a little toward me on the swing . She had on some lilac talcumpowder , I think . I used to belong to a high school fraternity at home , Beta Upsilon . They all go Kappa Psi here , but I was n't even asked to the house . P239Maybe you will be , Wyn said . Christ , I could n't shut up . I thought I had to impress her . I 'm sure Wyn did n't give a damn . The only thing to do then was to get closer to Wyn and keep quiet and feel . I suspected this , but I would n't take a chance . Yeh , this high school fraternity I belonged to was a local . We hadda lotta offers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We preferred to stay local , ' cause we were the best in the state and twenty years old . Gee , Wyn said . Her voice was a little vacant now . That must be a pretty good one  --  twenty years old . Yeh , I said . Why y'know we give two balls a year . And one guy did n't get an invitation to the last one and he shot himself  --  killed himself . You see we invite other people  --  like the mayor of the town and all the good people . It was a mistake that he did n't get an invitation , and he took a twenty-two and shot himself . Yes , that 's what I said . I had begun to be ashamed of all this  --  but it was like the bleeding of an unstaunchable wound . I could n't stop it , I had a diarrhoea of words and a constipation of ideas . Gee , Wyn said . Yeh , you see , I bragged , he thought I had cut his name off the invitation list , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but I did n't know anything about it . Wyn did n't say anything . She must have begun not to like it . But I went on . Why , the county attorney at home belongs to Beta U. He was one of the first members . Why , I would n't be surprised if he was headed for the governor'schair . The diarrhcea went on for a long time . Gosh , Wyn said . This was enough , Lee said . Oh , it was definitely a great plenty  --  and I knew it . But my words were a fatuous avalanche which had to stop only at the end of motion . Fork City was unusual . Oh hell yes . High school fraternities were against the law but the Beta U 's wore their pins openly . We were great guys ! Why , I said , we even send the principal an invitation to the dances . He does n't come , but he does n't say anything against it . But now that that boy committed suicide , I do n't think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate to see Beta U 's go .   Yeh , Wyn said . She brushed my coat lapel a little , trying to get me off the subject . That sure is too bad . Awful things like that happen . Gee , I 'd never shoot myself over anybody , would you ? Oh , I do n't know , I said . By now I was pumping up my empty ego with any airs I could find . I guess not over anybody . But I do n't know about suicide . I might if I was in a bad situation . I could n't think of a situation , so I said , Say , shall we go to the picture show ? Oh , Wyn said , I do n't particularly care about it . Shall we just sit here ? It 's an awful nice night . She moved a little closer to me , Lee said . As I see her now Wyn was only a sensation , both to herself and others . Maybe she was thinking of the Minnesota Campus in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the trees in bloom and the raids on the sorority house icebox at night and the surreptitious drinks when she sat in the kitchen in her pajamas with a boy . Perhaps she was thinking of the night last year when she had lain sweetly in the grass and kicked off her shoes as the hand moved up the smoothnessof her cool-skinned thigh  --  of how she smelled the clover and felt the earth underneath it on her back through the thin silk of her dress . With a hand on her thigh she could know that the thigh was smooth and the hand warm and tickly and she could feel all the sweet fumbly business of the beginning as she lay in the grass and the wrong of it and the explosion of lovely pain at the end and the wrong of it but you could almost forget the wrong because after you 'd done it once you might as well keep on doing it because you were a whore and had effed and besides if you liked a boy it was so much fun and if he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grass on a spring night was so good good good Wyn was about as simple as a flower  --  a seed will burst and up will come a violet . If Wyn got hungry , she would eat . If she got hot in the pants , she would make the double-backed beast with the best man at hand . She was near me now  --  but I was not the Great Lover whom you see before you now . The women of half a nation , nay , half of three or four nations had not gone to bed with Harrington , the peer of amorists.  |p241I  was , however , plagued by the guilt of other thoughts . I remembered that Harold Furnesson had shot himself because of a foolish mistake in an invitation list for the Beta Upsilon Ball , which was a Big Social Event in Fork City in those days . Why , there were social climbers in Fork City who regarded a bid to the Beta U ball as a Goddamned blithering accolade . You 'd think that there could n't be such things as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb to ? But there were . So there I was in my sad youth , with a pretty palatable girl beside me , the finest kind of a collegiate tart , who was mine for the taking , and what did I do ? I sat and lived in an agony of the past . I could see Harold Furnesson take the twenty-two from its place in the kitchen , go to the phone , one of Major Boylan 's old wall instruments , and call the girl in Lincoln . Maybe her name was Wildamay . And I could hear her voice crackling in the old receiver . Why Harold , I do n't know . I think I got ta date  --  but I 'll letcha know tomorrow . Well , you 'll be sorry , Wildamay , he said . And then the sob and the shot and Harold 's mother 's scream . From that my morose mind flew backwards and suddenly there was Kathleen Carter kissing the back of my neck , and the slick murderous-looking rubber tube hanging in the janitor 's closet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I passed it . I saw Melba Keylinger and Wilmia Farmer and Kathleen Carter watching me  --  and I heard Melba Keylinger laughing as if it were my bathwater gurgling down the drain . How was it that I had been involved in that thing ? Had I asked someone to get me a date for the dance because Wilmia Farmer would n't go with me ? Had Dee Given asked this girl Wildamay for me ? I had n't taken her . But I thought of Harold lying dead and I knew how Harold must have felt . I saw myself and Breezy Gortz and Dee Given on the playground . And I saw Dee Given push Harold down and Harold getting up , his face white and bloody and wild with tears running down this white face . Then Dee Given was pushing Harold down again and hitting him and Breezy Gortz was saying : Anybody can lick old Harold . What was worse , I was pushing Harold and seeing Harold's skinned and bloody hands as he got up from the gravel . Then I heard Breezy Gortz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's comin ' to give us our music lesson today . Old Lady Harsel stuck her finger up her arsel ! Why , anybody can lick old Harold ! I remembered the shame I had from this cruel and cowardly push of mine  --  and I saw Harold as he must have lain in his mother 's kitchen in Fork City dead , bloody and triumphant over Wildamay , Beta Upsilon and Fork City and all of us fools who still were quick . Yes , I sat there , with a shy melancholy young man 's arm around Wyn , spinning the wooly dirge of my dead or not so dead childhood in my head . The Hamletboy of the Plains . I should have had Wyn in the grass . I was twice hypnotized by Wyn against my side and the cub-laughter goochwhistle , giggles and screams of boys and girls walking home from boarding clubs and on dates in the dark on a Kansas Autumn hillside . For a second 's edge there seemed a kind of sensual security in this , Lee said . Then I saw last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in the August sunlight in Mississippi street . What if Wyn knew ? What if Wyn knew how homesick and wretched I was  --  what if she knew how little I valued myself in the world ? For a few seconds , I was afraid that Wyn might have got into the magiclantern section of my head and was now laughing at these ridiculous slides of little boys pushing each other on a schoolground and a youth lying dead in a kitchen with a twenty-two and a woman slapping her son in a Kansas street in August . But she could not get in ; my head was still a private projectionroom . And the pictures , though they spoke , did not speak in the same manner as Hollywood soundtracks speak today . They spoke in dark soft words which I only ( this I knew , for had I not listened and were the words not always soft and dark and private even when they had been originally violent ? ) could hear : Why anybody can lick Old Harold ! Old Lady Harsel stuck her finger up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her own head , which , I 've no doubt , were pleasant , passionate and soporific at once , such as the sensations of bursting the bud at MinnesotaP243in the spring . Beautiful , Lee said , if your brains are n't crawling with worms . And Wyn was a good kissing carrion . The pictures in our own heads made no difference to Wyn , for her head lay lightly and lazily on my shoulder . I had some brains : I let my hand cover her left breast . It was firm and sweet . But then I took my hand shyly away . I regretted this for I felt her thigh against my thigh and her cheek and hair against my cheek  --  and I smelled the lilac talcum powder . She turned her face as if to speak and I kissed her hard for a long time . I was ashamed of the fact that I stood to . I thought Wyn would be outraged , but she squeezed my arm and said : Good boy ! I kissed her several more times that evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even stood a little sidewise . She said , Good boy ! again and good night . When I went upstairs in the Kranz house , I stood in front of the mirror and posed as I lighted a cigarette in the manner I had seen Wallace Reid , the movie actor , do a long time ago in the dark of the Borealis Theatre when my father was playing billiards with Melba Keylinger 's father at the Commercial Club . I had planted a couple of shy wet kisses on Wyn Horner , from Appleby , Minnesotaand I already had begun to think of myself as the Fork City Casanova , the Seducer of the Steppes . Imagination had alreadycarried me on to the seduction of others . I had been born , stuck a tin sword in my eye , and come to college a homesick young fool . I had begun to accumulate the Devil 's litter , the manure of experience . P244The face with the snowflakesIT WAS a strange childlike face , perhaps like a cameo . Sometimes I thought it was like Desdemona 's  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a beautiful healthy nicely breasted young actress , but a high strung slim aristocraticDesdemona , a wilful girl with more spirit than the lines warrant . This girl would have resented the obeisances which Shakespeareanwomen always make to their lords and masters . She would have made a sharpsweet Desdemona . She had high cheek bones , a small straight nicely sculptured nose and dark blue eyes and honeycoloredhair . Sometimes in certain attitudes , her face was strange with a wispy strangeness . And though she was somewhat too tall and slim , which made her appear a little angular at times , this in a way added to the beauty of the girl . Later when the final sum or remainder or dividend or percentageof what she and I made together was set down , when nothing was requited and all was lost except a wave in the gray matter which reacted to snowflakes perhaps and the word crisp and the mention of certain towns and her father 's house in Louisiana street  --  when this was set down , it was as if there was really nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was long gone I saw a tall new actress , who spoke and looked like her , wore her clothes in the same manner and looked down off the screen at me as if she were the girl I had known at the university . Now I have only to see the snow , hear the word crisp , see the picture Paul et Virginie , or the Sistine Madonna and I see Anne 's face haloed around with incredible snowflakes . When I see the actress on the screen I am always with Anne . Perhaps it was only a day or so after I met Wyn that I saw Anne in a classroom . She was sitting quietly , gravely and attentively listening to the professor , taking down a note or two in the manner of interested concentration . I have always looked upon such aP245manner in a girl with wonder , for I was , in some way , conditioned to believe that all girls of my generation  --  especially the pretty ones  --  were at once saintly and frivolous . Thus , this attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attractive girl charmed me . It was an extra  --  something good after all the expected disappointment of life . It was an unexplainable tip from God to lure me on to the edge of the next mire of despair which I always foresaw would be there waiting for me  --  and for which , the entering of no matter what care I took , I would myself always be blamable . This was how I knew I was alive : the feel of the fuzzy ache of disappointment and despair . And time was lying in wait . The day that I first saw her in the classroom , I walked out of the house in Manila street . There were a few last cicadas burring indifferently in the dusk . All along Mississippi street up toward the Hill lights were on in the houses ; young voices fell slowly as feathers through the evening air , as students homeward bound from boarding-clubs to rooming-houses walked along the weedgrown brick . The lights , in the collegiate dusk , gave off almost as sad and as yellow little beams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Union Pacific . I walked fascinated through the crisping air enjoying the chilly melancholy of being alone in a fall evening when I was young and at the university and could think of a girl I scarcely knew . The rush week rains were over and the stiff skeleton leaves of elm and maple trees raked the brick paving with a penitential sound . I was the centre of the night of all the world and all the years : The girl , the university , Fork City , the stars , everything revolved around me  --  they still revolve around me , Lee said , but now I know that they are false and do the same pretentious disservice for everyone else , from the veriest schoolboy to Christ or Mahomet . But perhaps this is handy , for without an orbit , would not everyone go gallivanting down the comic winds of less use to himself than he is now ? I thought that perhaps Anne Whitehall had no bowels , was not a body of cellular structure at all . Patently she had a mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to genital organs , I could only surmise that she had a completely unheard-of arrangement , perhaps flowerlike . She seemed , even when I saw her , to haunt some obscure place of mystery , a fabric of my morbid and delicate imagination and the Victorian weathers of a professor 's tranquil house in Lawrence , Kansas in the nineteen-twenties . But I did n't even know about the house then . I sidled up to her as she came out of the classroom door and said : I did n't like that poem , did you ? She turned her dark blue eyes on me and , for a moment , looked as if she were going to be angry . Then she smiled . But a note was struck , a pitch was piped and she answered with what may be called a girlish laugh : Why , no , I never did think too much of Browning . I found I had n't thought too much of him , though I had not read more than two or three of his poems . We walked from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes . We damned well fixed Robert Browning and discarded him for the Victorian that he was . But he was never anything but incidental . I must have approached the phone as if I were an emboldened rat defying a large tigerish tomcat , but I had it in my hands . Lee Harrington , I said , Harrington , we talked about Browning  --  the poet . And then she gave a long , Ohhh ! Oh yes , she said . How are you , Mr. Harrington ? There , Lee said , by God , she gave me the proper respect too . I had graduated from being Nora and Bob Harrington 's boy , to Mr. Harrington . I had some dignity . Did she dance ? Oh , yes , she loved it . Well  --  yees ! the Varsity dance Saturday night . Why yes , she 'd like to go . Well , that was all right , I thought , Lee said . Her father was dean of the history department and she belonged to that sorority on the hill  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I smelled to heaven  --  as bad as the fraternities I had not been bidden into . Still , however , I could appreciate the strange beautiful quality about Anne , who was probably not yet changed in essence , though I stand before you the soiled remnant of something I never once was nor now ever want to be . Oh it was fine , I guess . I was now on the way to outsnob the snobs . Before I saw Anne again , I saw Wyn Horner . I got into a dark blue collegiate cut suit , that Charlie Carter had sold me in Kohnstam 's , in Fork City , and slicked down my hair as hard as I could . The streets were rattling more than ever with fallen leaves , and IP247felt the young sadness of being a transient in a transient moment . Wyn and I passed the sad smoky windows of a back street poolhall near an old brick fire station . The scene and the boys around the door of the poolhall , young men who could not go or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked unreal and anonymous . They stared at Wyn whose skirt was short . A young yokel with a clown 's face sang out : Ummm ! Looka that . One of the others whistled meatily . I turned and looked hard at them . Wyn had her hand on my arm . She closed it tight and whispered , Come on , Lee . Good boy ! she said . This seemed to be a standard filler remark in her conversation  --  butI was grateful to her for saving me the trouble of backing up my stare at the loafers . She had , however , accepted the lewd derisive admiration of the poolroom gang with a taciturn humility . It was a long time after that I remembered this incident and guessed that she probably enjoyed it  --  why , my God , maybe her nipples hardened . It 's just possible . We went to see a picture about a Freudian dream . During the more lush parts of the picture Wyn pressed close to me . It was a picture about the war with the Kaiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ermine cloak to save her husband 's life  --  on her back . The Hun officer in a Death 's Head Uhlan 's uniform with the Iron Cross stood ready to take her at the foot of the grand escalier . There was a portrait of an ancestress of the lady of the chateau in the same ermine cloak , Venus-in-furs . Maybe it was a crib from Aphrodite . But nothing really happened . The Hun beast had fallen asleep looking at the ancestress . God had sent down a wet dream at the behest of the ancestress who was , it appeared , a French Godiva . An immaculate seduction was consummated . Our Hun Rapist had been satisfied with a dry fornication . She discovered she would not be forced to accept a fate worse than death and the orchestra broke into Hearts and Flowers . I thought of Fork City and the Commercial Club and the Borealis and William S. Hart and Bessie Peel the blonde at the piano and Melba Keylinger that night she showed me . Wyn and I went to Gorham 's . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ornamental flower lights clustered around the mirrors , their petals concealing the tungsten globes . The long alleylike tiled room was full of palms in tubs and spidery heavy wire tables and chairs . At the fountain there was a line of stag soda drinkers bellied up on the high wire stools . As Wyn and I came in the whole stooled line pivoted slightly to look at Wyn , doing a right dress toward her legs and breasts . I could see the eyes bumping over her breasts , then they fell again as she passed , running over her buttocks and down on her legs like blood . They must have approved , for the eyes right lasted like a salute in a regimental review . Wyn kept her eyes front , toward the back tables of the confectionary where a few dates from the fraternity parties sat . In every university , even in bleak little theological colleges on the prairies of America , there are characters among the students . Brummell was up Oriel College , Oxford ; and Raleigh was there too . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harvard and Princeton have produced or harbored thousands . I also kept my eyes front ; and they saw what I have never forgotten . He was a youth of perhaps six feet , three inches , slender and most elegant in a dark blue boxbacked highbuttoned jacket and trousers widely belled . His black purpled silky curled hair was finely parted a little to the left of a definite widow 's peak and his upper lip wore a wide silky black mustache which he affected to caress and twirl as he leant over the marble top of the soda table playing the beau to a skinny ugly flamboyant sorority girl in a red dress who was at that time ( though I did not know it ) notorious throughout the campus for her so-called acidulous wit , her recklessness driving a roadster , her great capacity for consuming bootleg corn licker and her availability  --  even her desirability sexuallyto those boys of the campus who belonged to the proper fraternities , wore the proper clothes , spent the proper amount of money or wore the proper kind of characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did look more mature than the other youths around us  --  was leaning on a fine polished goldboundwalkingstick , the badge of nobility chosen by the senior law students to designate themselves as Senior Laws . Although I had never seen him before , I knew the moment I saw his **34;2790;TOOLONG face , that this was Count Baldur Livingstone , the great ornament to the law school , the Brummell of the campus . I had already heard most of the legends about him , for he was the Hero of the Hero-Worshippers and the Open Disgust and Secret Envy of the Serious Students , who pretended to despise his fripperiesand foibles . As I looked I saw he was holding with a dextrous air , in the same hand that he held the famous walking stick , a tweed golf cap . The story of this had been noised loudly . The count had said that since everybody was wearing hats all crushed in the same collegiate manner that semester , he would not be seen in anything so common . The fact was , he had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would outface the commonhattedherds in a gray tweed golf cap  --  the Style of the Semester . I like to believe now that perhaps Livingstone , who was always broke ( he came from a microscopic Kansas town called Pious Prairie where his father was an indigent preacher with ten children to feed , which made it imperative for the count to get through collegeon his wits ) had only the golf cap to his name and , therefore , foisted it off on the college boys and girls as a great innovation . Another story had it that the Kampus Hat Shoppe had overstocked on caps and paid the count a few dollars to set a vogue , which he did . By mid-semester he had grown a thick thistlelike stand of gray golf caps on the campus  --  and perhaps the Kampus Hat Shoppe had sold out its overstock  --  whereupon , he promptly started going bareheaded , saying that any head-covering at all branded a man a hick . Many boys caught bad colds in their heads . As we sat down in an inconspicuous corner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That 's Count Livingstone . Heeza Kappa Psi . As she looked at him with the dazed adoration of a bitchdog for its master , her eyes suddenly came into focus . She smiled her most charming let-me-lie-down-with-you smile and bowed the while , whispering : Good evening , Count . I looked over toward the table , and saw the count bowing remotely though engagingly to Wyn . Gosh , she whispered . Gosh . Heeza hottes ' stuff on the campus . My heart plummeted down like a meteorite , and I scowled . But I recognized it . He had something , compounded of charlatan/ism and a natural motherwit of which Raleigh and Brummell would have approved  --  something which actors have put vague name to for years . It 's a thing which is born with you . I hated and envied the bastard . I knew that Wyn and half the silly girls in the room were in heat for him only . I was wretched . I sat a struckdumbmost provincial freshman . He speaks to all the new girls on the Hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thinks all the girls are crazy about him . Wyn 's eyes glittered with something of a craziness . A boy with a white monkey cap on his oilslick black hair had stepped jauntily to our tableside . He was obviously a slicker who was working his way through college jerking soda . He grinned at Wyn . What 'll you have ? he said . Cherry coke , Charlie , Wyn said . Have something else , I said . Something more . I had to make some kind of an impression , for I felt as if I were a mouse among a herd of elephants . Have something else  --  something more . I 've got some moneyThass all I want reely , Wyn said . Reely ! I ordered a root beer . Count Livingstone bowed to the skinny girl and her escort , and moved , bowing , toward the fountain stagline . Good evening , men , the count said in a ceremonious voice . The stagline turned and , flattered , answered : Good evening , count . The count then came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose parade rest in which men 's fashion artists pose their models . Then , with over fancy casualness , he lighted a cigarette . He threw the business away . Some suave witty remark passed through the wreath of smoke around his dark shining head to the stagline . Those of the stagline who heard it laughed heartily  --  then the remark was passed down the line to those who had not , causing a ripple to the end of the fountain like the ripple of a stone thrown in water . Sick with envy and disgust , I could almost hear these apes saying : The count said : Doakes went Chi Chi because he did n't smell like a Psi Psi . Then the quip having been quipped , and while it still rippled in the apish airs of the room , the count cocked his golf cap on his head and sauntered out of Gorham 's . Gosh , Wyn said . Gosh . P251Yeh , I said . We sucked at our sodas . The count was a great man on the campus . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made love to at least half the freshman females who had pledged sororities and all the goodlooking ones who had not . The groundwork of this legend , I never could verify  --  but the women , Goddamn ' their foolish hides to hell , even the ones who said they would not be caught dead with him , melted like butter in a Kansas sunlight when he showed signs of interest in their little lives and backsides . I believe a poet of my class , a darkling fellow who often said a true thing and now long since dead of the drink , remarked one day that the girls ought to form a Former Bedfellows of the Count Association , to meet and recall their former glory , on the cold dateless winter evenings . Perhaps it was untrue to say , as I have heard said , that the count had beaten his father severely for suggesting that the count go to work in Pious Prairie and that subsequent to the beatinghe had disowned father , family and birthplace . I do know , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always said something like , Paris , France , London , England , the Orkney Islands , aboard a Turkish vessel plying in Bulgarian waters . Probably he had no home to which he cared to go , for when he was not somebody 's house guest , he stayed on at the fraternity house through all vacations to play poker with the more affluent Town Boys . He generally won . And he always affirmed quietly and gravely that he was working his way through college . Perhaps he did . But no one had ever seen him exert himself at anything  --  exceptonce . The captain of the Kansas tennis squad and one of its members were warming up on the university courts one day as the count was passing . The count stopped and watched and shook his head . Then when the captain 's opponent was about to serve , the count walked over to him and said gravely : Give me that racket , my good man . The tennis playing oaf , overawed , surrendered the racket ; and the count beat the captain six-love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his coat . He handed back the racket to the boy and said : You 've got too much top on your forehand for one thing , and walked away . That is the only record of exertion in the count 's college life . The captain and the fraternity tried to dragoon him into playing tennis for the university , but all he would say was : I 'm working my way through college and have no time for sport . There was once somewhere a record that he paid a house bill at the fraternity house , but only one . The fraternity tried to suspend him , but he would not leave the house  --  and nobody wanted the scandal of having him evicted . He explained that he lent enough tone to the fraternity , not to be bothered by bills . He did  --  everybodyknew it . So he was not kicked out . When talking to freshmen of either sex and a great many other people he always referred to himself in the third person as if he were a king or perhaps God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the count says  --  This man may have had a talent . It was obvious that he held the campus in his hand  --  but I have not heard of him in years . Nevertheless , I sat there in the soda fountain with Wyn wishingthat I could be like the count . I wished so hard that it hurt my spirit . It took me years to laugh when I remembered how I envied the count . There should be some way to impart and inform youth of what is desirable in the world . But what is desirable anyway ? Who loves me now , and where is there love or quiet or serenity or even a little safety in the world ? Perhaps the count was right . As Wyn and I sucked at our sodas , the couple over whom the count had leant got up . The skinny girl was dressed , I now saw , in spectacular redandgold silk . She had large gold gypsy hoops in her ears and her hair was straight and black  --  almost like the hair of a squaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a naked scimitar with the cutting edge upwards . Her arms were almost rail-like , but her legs were good . She stood in an attitude which gave me the impression she was about to pounce . She seemed a locomotive with steam up , a snake about to strike , a ballet dancer in the air . She was ugly , but she looked jaunty and rakish and beautiful . And there was a thing which was shocking at that time in a middlewestern university town : she was not only smoking in a public place , but she was walking out with the lipsticksmeared cigarette in her hand . That 's Etta Yonge , sheez that Zeta Phi , Wyn said . Sheezp253popular . Got her own car . They say she flunked out of O. U. Her father 's a big oil man . I heard her mother was part Indian . She sure gets around . Wyn was wistful . I scarcely heard anything but the Zeta Phi part . That was Anne Whitehall 's sorority . Did you say Zeta Phi ? I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I said , putting a mysterious air in the words as I thought of Anne . Wyn , however , was incurious . She was watching Etta 's tall somewhat jointless looking companion . He had a highdomed head of short curly hair and a high forehead . As I remember him now , Lee said , he had a very long face . It was not unpleasant , and just then I noticed his blue eyes were a little red above a striped silk bow tie . I saw that he was swaying a little . His suit was almost like the count 's . Drunk , Wyn said , smiling . That 's Gary Batters . Heeza Psi Chi . His father hadta send him to the Healey Cure place last year . Heeza nice boy though . Popular . Etta took hold of Gary 's arm and leaned a little snuggling lean on it and with an almost imperceptible sway they moved abreast the stagline of coke-bibbers . Etta stopped beside a slickhairedboy and lighted his cigarette for him with the fire from hers , then primped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then in a little flurry they passed down the line and out into the university night . A few other dates walked out without notice . I sat engrossed , frozen in a self-conscious attitude to the wire chair , dazzled by the beauty and chivalry of Kansas University . When I think of it now , it gives me a squinch of embarrassed shame , that I should have been as I was when I started my dry run for life . College students are at best a most useless and unsubstantial lot . They seldom even decorate the earth . Many study only drinkingand fornication . Many die as Gary later did , drunk in a snowstorm  --  frozen . In less than thirty years he had done a nightmarish Herculean labor for Pleasure . I said : Let us be born educated , or let us shoot everybody in their birthbeds . Dear Wyn and I walked down soda bar ; and the stagline stared again . I remembered the whistles at the poolhall and took another route home . I was still a little drunken from watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiercely : I do not want to be like Count Livingstone . I would not want to be seen with the girl Etta . I would not have a suit like the count 's . I do n't give a damn if I do not belong to a fraternity . From the dark hillside came a smell of dried leaves burning . At Missouri street the windows of the Nu Nu Kappa house threw yellow light shafts through the trees . I caught , as I walked , a glimpse of a medic backhunched over his book . I thought of his eyeaching brainfagging struggle alone in the swarming house of students . I shuddered , for I knew I felt no warmer , perhaps more alone than he who struggled . In truth , I felt irrelevant to everything , purposeless and wretched . Wyn was no use . I believe , however , she wanted to be , for her arm brushed against mine warmly . I wish I had a Stutz Bearcat , I said , foolishly . She turned her head in a sudden streetlightbroken darkness as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . She had an absent fascinated expression in her eyes . Oh , you 'll get it , she said in a manner at once obscure and comforting  --  but as if she had not heard what I said . A leaf-filled gust blew down the brick of the paving as we turned into Mississippi street on the corner where Nora had slapped my bull 's face . Brrrr ! Wyn said , Brrrrr ! Cold ? I said . That breeze , Wyn said . Winter ! She held tight to my arm and shivered . What Wyn said was true enough : The breeze had a knife in it . But I felt that the university had a knife at my back , that I was weak and gauche  --  and I felt or imagined I felt the wind making the old wound in my lung tighten . I coughed a little and a fleeting paroxysm of homesickness for the house on Third street and my father 's studio shook me briefly . I wanted to be home . But that was no good either , for I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not know what ever was going to become of me in this very street after the humiliating bus ride ? And was I not walking along beside Wyn , a desirable girl , hardly moving out of my silly tracks to make love to her which was obviously what sheP255was for ? To say that it was not the time nor the place would only be begging the question , for with a pinch of boldness and an ounce of manoeuvering we could have lain naked and young in each other 's arms . But my hotcold melancholy thoughts of Nora Beckham 's opinionof me and my future and her admonition to straighten up and try to act like somebody who amounted to something had left me with a chilly malaise which had spread from mind to body so that I felt wellnigh impotent . Yet here again Wyn was helpful . A very well of love . A tight-skinned luxuriant young girl who knew that this was the time , she did all she could . She burrowed warmly under my coat and helped me kiss and fumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . I pressed tight against her and felt her young breasts and flanks against me  --  I even got my hands under her clothes on fine beautiful taut hide . Things were going great guns on the porchswing . Despite the autumn air and my shy malaise , I was a little warmed  --  and then , swift as thought is , the thought of Nora came again with homesick hatred . I concluded that I must be different from everyone else , and then it occurred to me that I was worthless and it was doubtful what would become of me . In the middle of this conclusion Wyn 's flanks and breasts up against me seemed shameful  --  and I felt that I should have  --  and this is true  --  worn a jockey strap . Thus , Nora Beckham had put a ring in the bull 's head 's nose and was leading him on a forked stick as long as all the way from Fork City to the great university . I believe now that perhaps I am unusual  --  for if I had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been here at all . I should not have been able to live with Nora Beckham as my mother . Good boy ! Wyn said . Good boy ! But the thoughts had gone through my head like a withering fire  --  and I withered and drew away from the girl . Well , I said , I got ta go , I guess . Wyn knew when a thing was hopeless  --  and , besides , a sharper chillier wind blew up , the leaves rattled , the porch swing squeaked and groaned and the wind gave the first whistle around a house-corner that I had heard that fall . Brrrr ! Wyn said again . Winter ! Well , I 'm sorry . Call me up .   I ran down the steps of Wyn 's porch and up the steps of Harold Kranz . I got up to my room , coughed and lighted a cigarette , clenched my fists and drew back to smash them into the wall . I began to cry . My sobbing began to hurt my throat . I coughed more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided to undress and get into bed to keep warm . I got my clothes off , piled the rag rugs on the bed along with my overcoat . I lay shivering for a long time . Then I began to generate some heat , I felt a little better . What in God 's name , was the matter with me ? I had two girls on the string , Wyn Horner , a beauty queen and Anne Whitehall , a professor 's daughter . God 's wounds , was I not a Casanova in great demand ? I had contrived to forget the scene at Gorham 's CocaColasalon . P257The Great LoverYES , I began to prink my mental feathers as I lay there in the Manila street bedroom . I was already a great lover . That nothing was consummated only caused the fantasy to grow  --  but it grew as if it were a caverniculous plant without color , as if indeed it were some horrific fabric like the fight with the devilfish fern in the house on Third street when I was a boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls Anne and Wyn , or parts of each , lay in bed with me ( to say nothing of the woman in the Hun Rapist 's wet dream ) even after I had gone to sleep and made my sleep a distended misery . When I awoke , it was still dark and I lay , melancholy , in a cold sweat . I was uncomfortable for I felt the lung tightening up again . And I thought , Oh Jesus Christ , is that Goddamn ' thing going to bleed again ? Then , for a second , it occurred to me : What if it does ? They 'll take me home and I 'll lie in bed ill with nothing to plague me but disease . I 'd rather have the lung bleed again than bear the humiliations I bear here . I saw myself riding the bicycle again , a sheet of blood spread like redpaint in the sunlighted air . Southern , the quack , was saying : Yes , Mrs. Harrington , the thing of it is  --  I began to blubber a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with soft violent explosions of Wyn 's breasts and thighs , Anne 's long legs and face and the parts of women I had seen in the streets and the face of the girl whose soldier friend had told Grandma Beckham they were just married . I did n't sleep much that night . In the morning I was weak from the violence of the night , with the night thoughts and their images still on the loose in my head , cold and shameful . My groins felt strained , my scrotum loose , my eyelids stuck together . I believed that my hide , instead of having the organs , lights , apparatuses which were normally indigenous to a man , was perhaps filled with some slow ooze of viscous pus , which might , as I walked down the street , issue , without alarums to me or anyone else , from all the natural parts in me  --  and indeed , perhaps break through where there was no natural door . As if I had churned up this inward putrefaction by some action I could control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I must keep out of sight of other mortals better than I. How and why they were better than I , I did not know . Perhaps there was some superior peristalsis working in their brains  --  an action of paradise of which I could have no inkling . Although they were not this way of their own will , I hated them for it . I hated everybody , for I fancied they could see my putrefactive inside . Moreover , I knew I could see in them the usual machinery which allowed them to live their lives with the Goddamned arrogant , triumphant expressions they had mounted upon their ugly victorious faces . I did not consider far enough to reason that there must be billions as miserable as I. Nor did I look closely into the foolish tortured , stupid faces around me  --  for , if I had looked into them with attention , I should have seen the pus  --  laudabile et bonum as the surgeons miscalled it when they could neither explain it or scotch it  --  the pus of life running out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help grow more men next year . I went into the Kranz bathroom and hacked the bubbling phlegm from my lung , swallowed an aromatic creosote globule which Dr. The Thing of It Is Southern had prescribed . I deflated my lungs again hard and felt more phlegm bubbleup to my mouth . I choked and spat a yellow-brown blob . I hacked and excreted until , after toothpaste , water and soap I felt fairly clean of my own stench . I punched and squeezed at my face . I flushed the water closet and issued into the hall , where my nose caught the sweet concupiscent odors of the girl roomer 's powders and unguents of beauty and the smell of the female . My lungs stabbed me again and my head was a penny arcade of Venus . I was weak when I closed the door of my room . Before I dressed , I sat down a minute . When I was dressed , I walked into the hall again . The odors still hung around and over the place . It was almost like being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her door in a particolored kimono , her northern blonde hair lying long over her shoulders . The smell of the unguents thickened . She had a towel and some bathroom gear in her hand , which gave her to fumble at her door knob . Scared and rabbity and insanely shy , I helped her close it . Thanks , the tall girl said slowly . Her voice poured like oil , thickly . Her carcass had fine luxuriant breasts , good shoulders and fine thighs . A slow-timed voluptuary . You could wrap yourself in her fine flesh and melt into an ecstasy . You would have nothing to worry about , when you were thus enwrapped , for you would be only a sensation riding in warm space . There would be no time for thought and all time for feeling . I could see the luxuriant breasts which as yet did not hang but stood jutting softly under the thin silk . You 're on the Hill are n't you ? she said kindly . She turned and her sweet concupiscent odors and the vapors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kranz hallway . Why , I was a fly caught in that saccharine-sticky poisonous stuff on the paper which was invented by man for the torture and the making of small lives into small slow deaths . She had the thumbscrew on me . As she turned , I noticed she was using the clutch method of holding her kimono together . And this looked to me , for a brief flash , like a sequence of Lilian Gish in Orphans of the Storm . The turn emphasized her thighs and buttocks ; after which I saw her belly mounding up gently to a gentle swell . She seemed to squeeze me dry with a look . She smiled slowly and I could feel my scrotum tighten  --  I could even feel her warmth in the air . You 're Lee Harrington , are n't you ? she said . I 've heard a lot about you from  --  she turned her eyes toward the stairs . I 'm glad to meet you . I 'm Helen Lundbeck . Just a minute . She walked slowly into the bathroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she tightened the silk kimono around her so that the tits embossedlittle round buttons in the silk . She turned her eyes toward the stairs again . I guess she 's not here , she said . Helen wrinkled her nose . Say what do you think of this place ? By that time , the lasciviousness of my thoughts and the smell and look of Helen had had the effect of a Montmartre peepshow on me which is to make me stand to and not stand to . I do n't know . Why ? I said . I thought my voice was hoarse . Well , Helen said , hitching the silk closer to her hide so the buttons stood out the more . I 've known Harold 's grandma a long time . I did n't reely wanta stay here  --  but my mother insisted and wrote me such wonderful things about dee-yuhr grandma and **33;2826;TOOLONG that I come to stay with them when I came back on the Hill that I almost had to do it . Well , grandma talked this guy , Harold , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Greek god . Well , you 've seen him , have n't you ? So darn funny ! She said if she was on the Hill she would n't give anybody a date unless he was a fraternity man  --  and she always used to say Harold would n't be anything but a Kappa Psi . But I happen to know he did n't get anything but a Zee Zee hid  --  and you know everybody knows about them  --  and he would n't go Zee Zee . She said he 'd stay Barb first . Well , he did . He 's a silly . And he gets too darn friendly with me when dee-yuhr grandma is n't lookin ' . I was staring at the silk embossed buttons and the tight mounds holding them up . The insides of my flanks were tight and I felt as if I had a fever . You 're a senior , are n't you ? I said . This was only to help pierce the concupiscent unguent-smelling airs between us , for I felt that they would burst and hotly splatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said or made to happen . Yeah , she said , I 've only got about a semester left on the Hill to get my degree . What you takin ' ? I said . Unembarrassed , Helen stood on one foot , lifting the other with solid , slow grace , tightening up the silk covered rich curve of her flanks . You 'd never believe it , she said , but I 'm a biology major . Oh , Jesus , would n't I ? I thought . I 've already got a secretarial job in the department for when I get out . An ' I 'll be glad to get out too , I hate to study . Say , I said , maybe  --  maybe I should n't inquire , but what sorority do you belong to ? That was n't what I had started to say . MaybeP261I was going to ask her for a date  --  maybe I was going to say , Helen , will you come to bed with me now . And she would have looked down the steps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you wo n't tell , why not ? It 's healthful . And then we would have walked into her room  --  and she 'd have said , Be careful of the sheets . Grandma 's got eyes like a hawk . But I did n't ask her . Not that it matters , I said . I do n't belong to a fraternity . She smiled , stretched a little and pulled the silk over the nipple buttons in the silk . I think they had drawn up and erected now for she knew what was in my mind , all right . I do n't mind , she said . No , I do n't belong to any . I was an Omega Omega pledge at Arkansas . But when I came here the Omega 's were nasty to me when I went to their house the first time  --  so I never went back . I ca n't be bothered . I go to see my fiance  --  an older man  --  who was an officer in the war in the City every weekend anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as lush and warm a loveleech as I could have found in a Persian slavemarketat a high price . I could n't even try . Maybe I could n't have made it  --  but I ought to have tried . I did n't say anything for a second , and then I blurted : Well , I wanted to make a fraternity , but I did n't . Well , that 's very frank of you , Helen said . Most men would n't admit it . She smiled slowly . Say , do you know Anne Whitehall ? I said . That finished the warm feeling which had thickened between us . Helen stopped tightening her kimono  --  and the breast buttons flattened . Well , not personally , but I 've heard she 's an awfully attractive girl . Her father 's a dean  --  and she 's a Zeta Phi . Helen smiled falsely and contemptuously now , I thought . I 've heard she 's an awfully nice girl . Yes , I think she is , I said . It seems I had another diarrhea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Varsity dance tonight . Oh well , gee , Helen said . That 's fine . Gosh ! I got ta hurry . I 'm on my way to the city . See you later . She turned in the bathroom door , her buttocks undulating , and left me aching in the hallway . I got down stairs and out into some hot leftover summer . I trembled and sweated in the sunlight . Inside my head , the lanternslideshad turned into a moving picture . Wyn and Helen , both undressed before me , lay thighs spread breasts pointing upward . I stumbled on the weedgrown bricks , blinded by the sun and the nakedness . There I was a bloody Count Livingstone golfcap tilted a little over one eye , wearing a dark green bell bottomed suit from Kohnstam'sin Fork City . I had a necktie so small that it looked like a shoestring . I was loping along toward a Greek restaurant , ( The Ultra Modern maybe ) to eat some greasy breaded veal cutlets before I went to take a girl I thought looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shamefast , of lying with other women . I was dissatisfied with the width of my bell-bottomed trousers . Had not Count Livingstone 's reached from his heel to his toe ? I stumbled again and cursed . Holy Christ on a bloody cross of thorns , I was only half alive and that half was so beaten that I deserved to be drowned like an unwanted pup . And yet it was only a mistake  --  a simple error . Just like that . I might have had both Wyn and Helen  --  and I might have walked with my head up  --  not stumbling . But there was always Nora Beckham , standing inside my bull 's head saying : I do n't know what will ever become of you . P263The little blob of glueLOUISIANA street was wide and still ; it seemed a passage in a great cave . There was a chilly noon like a nickel-plated peach leaf in the sky . Wood and leaf smoke hung in the weekend air ; and the street lamps burned free of the summertime bugswarms . They looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinned of leaves . In Louisiana street and all over the town and the Hill , the leaves lay or blew around on the bare bricks of the pavement . It was an in-between hour , when those who were going out were finishing dressing and those who were not had already settled in . I could hear the wind rattle and swish as my feet plunged and slipped down the hillside . Through the windows of houses I could see table edges and tablelamps washing snug rooms in a sad snug yellow glow . Somewhere I heard desultory ragtime on a piano tinkling and spilling down the hillside . Just over the crest of the Hill , I heard a girl 's laugh , a rich bodied laugh , like cream gurgling from a bottle . I saw her pass under a street lamp with a tall boy . She had a smooth pretty untroubled face . Yeh , the tall boy said . We sure had one on the Sig Sigs . The girl gurgled again and tossed her black hair in the street light glow . Someone turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant 's peace and content  --  a warm feeling in the great abattoir . In the fartherest reaches of the corner light , I stopped and looked at the thin model watch Nora and Robert had given me when I was graduated from the Fork City High School . ( I lost it later one night along the towpath of the Isis River at Oxford . ) The slim black hands came up on the silver dial at eight minutes to nine . It would n't do , I had less than a block to go  --  and I could n't arrive too early . I sneaked a look over my shoulder and faced about to walk around the block.  | The wind got a little chillier . This and my nearness to the Whitehall house made my hands grow colder and moisten with shyness . I coughed a little and spat . I put a peppermint inside my mouth for I remembered my breath had a strange smell sometimes when I coughed . I pulled myself up the hill past several fraternity houses , which were dimly lighted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with girls . As I walked trying to act as if I were going directly somewhere and not killing time  --  for I was sure that such fellows as the Count and Candle Power would arrive arrogantly late for a date  --  I began again the mawkish self-torture which I had now become used to . Anne 's father was a professor ; she was a Zeta Phi ; and she looked so proud and beautiful . I was from Fork City and a freshman and did n't belong to a fraternity  --  and I had all those thoughts about women naked and all those feelings . I had done a thing like wetting my pants in Sister Therese 's room in front of Vee Crump . And my mother had slapped me just over the Hill there on Mississippi street in front of the old brick house on the corner for being a bullheaded and an unfilial son . It was doubtful whatever would happen to me . Perhaps I should end in prison or on the gallows , if my mother knew what she was talking about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was the guy who pushed Harold Furnesson down in the third grade schoolyard after Dee Given and Breezy Gortz had said that anybody could lick Old Harold . How in the name of God , could I expect to touch Anne Whitehall enough to dance with her ? Old Lady Harsel stuck her finger up her arsel , I said aloud and laughed wildly . I kept on walking and chasing these thoughts like rats through my head until my hands were like melting ice jammed down hard in my pockets . Nobody could be any worse off , any more miserable than I. And no miraculous movie flashback burst over the hillside to show me that I was really happy and that things could be much worse than this . And by God , I do n't think they could have been . There must have been some wretched impermeable little blob of glue inside me that held me together , else I should have fallen to pieces in the gutter and blown away with the dry leaves . But IP265did not . I lived to regret it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wondering if Nora was right . Thus , I arrived for the first time on the porch of Anne Whitehall'shouse in a dim and chilly sadness . I felt as if I were a cold jelly  --  that nothing could ever warm me  --  and perhaps nothing ever has . Contagious blastments had already overtaken me , Lee said , so that I could not even call upon a pretty girl without getting sick as an ancient virgin at menopause . Fah ! I was infected in the head with the cold rottenness of youth . And over and above chill in the entrails , as I stood there on the porch I believe , for the first time , time sneaked up and tweaked me by the nose . I began to know about time . Old . It was an old frame house . That is it was old for Lawrence  --  built 1864 perhaps right after Quantrell 's raid . An L-shaped box on the Louisiana street hillside with two porches leaf and branch sequestered . The street was full of great maples and elms which rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light in a transom above the front door and the porchlight was on . A skeleton elmleaf scraped across the gray painted pine floor of the porch . A spider skin jerked stiffly in a web beside an old iron umbrella stand . Near the stand lay a mudgray pair of rubbers and a graying doormat . I looked up at the door . Through the cold mood of my heart and gizzard , I felt a melancholy recognition . It was as if I had met a distant acquaintance from Fork City , say in Piccadilly Circus  --  an old friend who never was a friend in the Boulevard Raspail . On the glass of the front door of Anne Whitehall'shouse in Lawrence sat the harpwoman with the fleurs-de-lis and the hookah and the Ottoman , the same who had sat in the glass in the door of the house on Third street in Fork City , guardian over Poor Yorick , the Octopus , the Chinaman cupholder , the Long Beach souvenir paperweight and all the treasures of Nora Beckham'slife for so many years . God Almighty , Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homesickness and revulsion attacked me at once , again ; and I almost turned and fled Anne Whitehall 's porch . This , I thought , is a wretched theme which will harp on me until I die . The harpwoman and the four candlepower light on the porch and all the words : Son , I want you to distinkly understand  --  Do n't
