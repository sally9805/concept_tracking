txt The approach of the Federal Government to business regulation , including the key question of antitrust enforcement , is now under review , with the possibility of vital changes between Election Day and early 1947 . Keys to the incipient alterations were the recent substitution of W. A. Harriman for Henry A. Wallace as Secretary of Commerce , and the activities of Lowell Mason , President Truman 's emissary on the Federal Trade Commission . The changes would involve new approaches to the following prob-lems : 1 . " Small business , " a term for something almost indefinable , which has become a kind of political football . 2 . Anti-trust law enforcement , now in charge of Wendell Berge. 3 . Coordination of the often-conflicting Federal program for stifling monopoly , on the one hand , and throttling " cuthroat competion " on the other . Trade Practice Considered 4 . Improvement , perhaps even complete revamping , of the " trade practice conference " technique of the Federal Trade Commission . Intimates of Mr. Harriman report that he feels too new on the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude toward " small business , " but they predict he will review the present program of the Commerce Department in the " small business " field . Ever since the Commerce Department sponsored a small business conference in the latter Nineteen Thirties , the Government and members of Congress have paid increasing attention to it . The Commerce Department has a large staff devoted to its problems and members of Congress introduce scores of bills designed to provide " small business " with some // special prop , benefit , or even subsidy . Although the political pressure for making the " ' small business man " feel that he is a special ward of the Federal Government is tremendous , some who have discussed the matter with Mr. Harriman have gained the impression that he may incline to limit his doctrine of " small business " assistance to " protection " as distinguished from subsidy . " Protection " Is Pondered Those who oppose subsidizing of " s1 .. all business " on the ground that elimination of risk at the lowest level of the economy would undermine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government credit assistance to small business is a kind of subsidy . " Protection " of small business , as distinguished from subsidizing it , would mean enlivening the antitrust and anti-cutthroat competition laws to assure small enterprises a chance to grow . It is at this point that the roles of the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department bear importantly upon Administration policies toward " small business . " It is known that some Cabinet members have expressed concern over what they regard as excessive zeal on the part of Mr. Berge and his anti-trust division in the enforcement of the law . The President 's attitude remains unknown , but Mr. Truman has made it clear that he wants the " rules " under which business is conducted in this country to be made clear , so there can be no mistake about what the " rules " are . It was this desire of the President , plus his reported conviction that the Federal Trade Commission had been more interested in " witch-hunting " than in working out a practical and understandable code of business practice , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his career at the FTC . Mason 's Attack Is Cited Apparently reflecting the President 's views in the matter , Commissioner Mason himself attacked the commission majority for what he suggested was " puritanical meddling " and " busybodiness " in his unorthodox opinion in the Manhattan Brewing Company case . It was the first opinion a commissioner had written in years , a fact which Commissioner Mason cited as proof of the contention that the commission was adjudicating in the dark , all to the confusion of business men . Now Commissioner Mason is off on a new tack , this time with the apparent support of his colleagues . It is a new application of the commission 's trade practice conference technique , which will be demonstrated for the first time Nov. 7 when he presides over a conference of members of the household dye industry . The new idea is to go out and interest whole industries in agreeing to proper trade practices which will , at one and the same time , protect the members from both anti-trust violations and cutthroat competition . House Group Talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House Appropriations Committee June 7 : " A sporadic , hit or miss prosecution of the faults in industry does not remedy them any more than the oldfashioned way of punishing criminals by erecting a gibbet at a crossroads and every now and then hanging somebody for something . " The commission wasprganized , I think , to go out and ? beet these problems on the battleground rather than sit back , as the courts have had to do , and as the courts must do today , and only take those cases which come to them . " Our good in business is going to have to come from business itself , because that is where it has always come . We can not impose it by injunction and by cease and desist orders and by indictments from the top . As a matter of fact , it is not democracy if you have to do it that way . " It appears that while the FTC has been trying to cooperate with the business community under the inspiration of the President and Mr. Mason , the Anti-Trust Division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoys some people at the top of the Government . An example was the case of an agreement arranged by the FTC under which a group of electrical manufacturing companies obtained immunity from RIM-trust laws under the Webb-Pomerene Act for purposes of their foreign trade . The Anti-Trust Division quickly swung into action and ? brought anti-trust suits against Westinghouse and General Electric , the two largest companies in the group . There were suggestions in official circles that the Anti-Trust Division drew upon some of the information elicited by the FTC in connection with its negotiation of the Webb-Pomerene agreement . Tom Clark , Attorney General , while reiterating his belief in the importance of anti-trust law enforcement in a speech at Boston on Thursday , said : " Let me say very clearly that the Department of Justice does not seek to punish for ti.ts sake of punishment . It does not carry on a vendetta with the business man . It seeks only to deter the violation of our basic economic law . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
