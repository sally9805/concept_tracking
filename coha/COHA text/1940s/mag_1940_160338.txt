TODAY AND DESTINY : Excerpts from Spengler 's The Decline of the West-Edited by Edwin Franden Dakin-Knopf ( $2.75 ) . <P> During all the dark years of World War I , Oswald Spengler in a dank Munich tenement suffered from endless headache while he composed Der Untergang des Abendlandes . During the ' 20s , readers in seven languages suffered likewise in the effort to follow its vast erudition , cosmic vision , Teutonic mysticism . Americans read it as The Decline of the West . Because its title suggests doom &; disintegration , and because it was the gospel of the Nazi intellectuals , The Decline of the West is perhaps the most misunderstood of the influential books of the 20th Century . Last week a U. S. disciple of Spengler , Edwin Franden Dakin , selected and expounded the most currently relevant 15% of Spengler 's text . Today and Destiny ap peals to the U. S. 's weakness for digests . It also appeals to the U. S. 's apprehension for its national future on a quaking planet . Far more than the shrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 197,500 ) , Spengler makes profitable U. S. reading in 1940 . <P> Born among the Harz Mountains in 1880 , Oswald Spengler loved peasants , lonely landscapes , flowers . He revered Goethe , adapted his philosophy of destiny-inspired evolution to mankind 's history . Through Halle , Munich , Berlin he pursued a Ph.D . in mathematics and philosophy . In later years Spengler 's contempt for Communism , forecast of Caesarism , belief in ruthless action over thought made him a Nazi favorite . But he despised Hitler 's racial theories , self-conscious sense of history-making-and said so boldly until his death in 1936 . <P> The Decline of the West is a philosophy of history . Spengler boots out the Ancient-Medieval-Modern pattern of schoolbooks , the " Progress " pattern of reformers and optimists , the cause- &-effect; patterns of rationalists . He sees each culture-Classical , Chinese , Arabian , etc. - as an organic entity which is born , flourishes , wanes , dies , like plants and animals . As organisms , cultures have a uniform morphology , except where accident intrudes ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventurers ) . Lifetime of a culture is about 1,500 years . Western culture of 1940 is at about the same stage of its life cycle as the Egyptian of 1600 B.C. , Chinese of 250 B.C. , Classical of 100 B.C. For proof Spengler waved his learned pointer at such diverse phenomena as Karnak 's temples , Mozart quartets , Chinese gardening , Marxism , Aztec city planning , jazz , Greek vases , Napoleon , Russian grammar . <P> Since cultures develop uniformly , the course of an unfinished cycle can be predicted . As early as 1911 , when his great work was conceived , Spengler foresaw for Western1 culture 1 ) not only World War I but World War II , III . . . : ) the coming Caesars , victors over Capital ; 3 ) declining birth rates ; 4 ) decay of art from high style to petty cult problems ; 5 ) budgets of billions not millions ; 6 ) suicidal crumbling of democracy , etc . He did not predict imminent collapse of Western civilization . Said solemn Prophet Spengler : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> In Today and Destiny Disciple Edwin Dakin presents mainly Spengler 's views on economics and politics :
