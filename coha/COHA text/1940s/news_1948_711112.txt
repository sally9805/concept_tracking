ALBANY , March 10 ? Passage of a thoroughly revised and deflated version of Mayor William O'Dwyer 's " package " for New York City was promised tonight by Republican legislative leaders following a long conference with Governor Dewey and state administration officials . In place of the fifteen measures requested by the Mayor , Senator Benjamin F. Feinberg , majority leader , and Speaker Oswald D.

More State Aid Voted Down All three measures were scheduled for passage in both Senate and Assembly tomorrow . The Repnblican majority in the Assembly had voted down three Democratic proposals to take up for final passage measures that would have increased state aid to New York City by $84,000,000 . It was the Republican refusal to make any concessions with respect to increased state aid that led Mayor O'Dwyer and Democratic leaders to abandon their own fare bill and the rest of the " package " earlier in the week . Irwin Steingut , minority leader , told the Assembly tonight that the Republican refusal of more state aid would be made an issue in the legislative election campaigns in the fall . " Our case does not end here , " he declared as the Democratic proposals were rejected . " We have another forum and we shall appeal to it after we leave here . I am sure there will be keen resentment in New York City at the treatment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the proposals defeated called for state payment of half the city 's education costs , representing an increase in state aid of $32,000,000 . It was rejected 100 to 45 with only two Republicans , Samuel Roman of Manhattan and Lewis W. 011iffe of Brooklyn voting with the minority . The second Democratic move called for state reimbursement of SO per cent of the city 's expenditures for the medically indigent and for neglected and dependent children . Mr. Roman was the only Republican to vote for it . It would have cost $32,000,000 . The third motion proposed to take up for passage a bill increasing per capita payments to the city from $6.75 to $10 , representing an additional cost to the state of $22,000,000 . Again Mr. Roman was the only Republican to vote in favor . Democratic members of the Legislature were highly elated at the turn of events with respect to the O'Dwyer transit bill and the rest of the " package . " Most of their high spirits stemmed from the fact that they were released from commitments to vote for the transit measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is assured of a fare bill that he can use if he wants to and which puts only himself on a political spot . Mr. Steingut said tonight that the Democrats would vote for the increase in gross receipts , tax , which was part of the original " package , " and also for the exemption of hospital debt , which Mayor O'Dwyer wants . The latter had been part of a much larger debt-exemption proposal . The Republican program for meeting New York City 's needs was announced officially by Senator Feinberg and Speaker Heck after the conference in the Gov // governor 's office . In addition to the ' Governor and legislative leaders those present included Lieut . Gov . Joe R. Hanley , Frank C. Moore , Controller ; John E. Burton , Budget Director , and Charles D. Breitel , counsel to the Governor .

" Such action will serve to more than balance the budget of the City of New York , and according , ly , we will support these two measures as well as the constitu-tional amendment exempting from , the debt limit , the $150,000,000 for ' ( hospital construction . " I Fare Power in Transit Board The Republican fare bill was reported out of the Senate Finance Committee this afternoon I and put on the calendar for tomorrow over the objections of Senator Elmer F. Quinn , minority leader . It repeals the Muzzicato Law , which would have made any fare increase subject to a referendum ordered by the City Council . In addition , it vests the power to change the fare on the city 's transit lines in the Board of Transportation , subject to approval by the Mayor . Further it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start of the city 's fiscal year on July 1 . Mayor O'Dwyer 's bill would have required the Board of Transportation , acting alone , to fix a rate of fare sufficient to meet all operating costs . The Republican bill makes no requirement . that the fare be increased to meet operating costs but leaves the matter entirely to the discretion of the Mayor and Board of Transportation . In addition the city version contained two changes in the Rapid Transit Law that are completely omitted in the Republican bill . One would give the city the right to lease transit equipment under service contracts . The other authorized the leasing of subway mezzanine space for stores and businesses .
