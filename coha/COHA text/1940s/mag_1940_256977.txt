In the spirited contest for most popular U. S. radio performer , Comedian Jack Benny has since October 1937 run a close second to a perverse but inanimate object - the saucy ventriloquist 's dummy known as Charlie McCarthy . At the 1939 finish , Charlie ( Chase and Sanborn Hour ) had an estimated 27,000,000 Sunday-night listeners : Jell-O 's Jack Benny , an hour earlier on the same NBC-Red network , 24,000,000 . Beginning Jan. 7 , Standard Brands pared the Chase and Sanborn program to a half-hour , saving some $7,500 in airtime charges , plus salaries of Hollywood fixtures like Dorothy Lamour , Don Ameche . <P> Last week the first Cooperative Analysis of Broadcasting ( Crossley ) reports for 1940 showed a new king of radio . Jack Benny , a three-time front runner before Charlie came along , was in first place again . In his first month as a half-hour program , Charlie had lost over 1,000,000 listeners . In the same month Jack Benny 's chuckly half-hour had picked up an estimated 3.000,000 listeners .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
