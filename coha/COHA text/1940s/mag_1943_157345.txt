At a mud-walled headquarters on the South China front , Major General Claire Lee Chennault last week gave a succinct review of Japanese air power : <P> &gt;The Japs use a vast aerial stagger system to guard their empire and train air crews for combat . Freshman flyers go to central China to bomb relatively undefended towns . Then they move by easy stages to Formosa for additional training . In the Canton-Hong Kong area , they next bomb southern China and come up against Chennault 's Fourteenth Air Force . The survivors proceed to Thailand and Burma , where they still tangle with the Fourteenth and also with R.A.F. and U.S. airmen based in India . Last stop for those still alive is the Southwest Pacific , where the Japs concentrate their best equipment , their finest airmen . <P> &gt; The Japs have plenty of planes . Their great difficulty , according to Chennault , is the training of enough men to fly the planes . A secondary bottleneck is aviation fuel . Many a Japanese tanker has gone down under the assault of Allied raiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strike decisively at Japan 's sea communications . <P> &gt; General Chennault is doing the best he can , with the little he has , to whittle down Jap air power in China . Last week he revealed a significant fact . To relieve sorely strained U.S. crews and to make up for the lack of sufficient replacements from the U.S. , the Fourteenth is absorbing competent Chinese pilots and crews . The General had personally trained some of them . Said he : " I defy the Japs to tell Chinese from Americans in combat . "
