THE P-51 mechanic , curiosity and perhaps a trace of contempt written on his features , squatted under the wing of the jet-propelled plane and ran an eye over the flame tube . Other mechanics were installing an engine in the jet job . S/Sgt . Earl Kohler , in charge of the project , glanced up . " How does she look , Bill ? " he asked the Mustang man . " Well , " came the considered reply , " I 'd call that a plumber 's nightmare . " That was early in the history of jet propulsion in the Army Air Forces . Since that day , mechanics on conventional fighters and bombers have asked Kohler and his crew a million questions about servicing the jet plane . " They want to know , " says Sergeant Kohler with some impatience , " what wrenches we use . How long it takes to pull an engine . How the jet works . One guy even asked if it uses fuel . All kinds of damn fool questions . " Kohler , who operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army , was one of the first AAF mechanics chosen to work on the original XP-59A jet plane while it was being put through months of tests in the California desert . After the project was revealed , he was sent to Wright Field to keep the planes in shape for training and further experiments . " Every mechanic gets a funny feeling when he first sees the jet job , " Kohler says . " I remember what I thought . I said to myself , ' Hell , this thing wo n't fly . There 's not enough stuff . ' But after the jet took off a few times , I began to get the idea . " Mechanics trained on Thunderbolts , Lightnings , Marauders , and Fortresses any of our aircraft with conventional engines ? have learned to think of power in terms of solid machinery , Kohler explains . In a conventional engine everything is solid and tight . Mechanics think in terms of complicated wiring , ignition , gauges and cylinders , elaborate fuel systems . Everything is complicated . " But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You put in six quarts of oil , just like an automobile . " The cooling system is just a couple of oil jets which spray lubricant and air into the two rotor shaft bearings . The oil is standard hydraulic fluid 3580 . The excess runs down and forward into the accessory section , and is returned by a small scavenge pump . The system is cleaned by a Cuno filter . The generator , fuel pump , and starter are the only accessories carried over from the conventional plane , and the ignition is even more simple than the oil . system . There are only two spark plugs , located in the No. 4 and No. 8 combustion chambers . The other chambers are interconnected and ignite from these two . After the unit is started , combustion continues without further assistance from the plugs . Combustion is as steady as the flame of an oil furnace . Plugs last as long in the intense heat of the jet as they do in a conventional ' engine . In the jet their spark gap is considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which must be classed as a training plane in the jet field . Yet , with few exceptions , their experiences would be applicable to any jet aircraft . " We use about a fifth as many tools , " Kohler explains , " and maintenance of a jejt plane is less than a fifth of what it is on the other kind . As for the engine , it 's so damn simple I ca n't understand it . " Air comes in the front end , goes through the compressors ,  | mixes with kerosene in the combustion chambers , and is ignited . It blasts out through the flame pipe , and that 's all there is to it . How the hell that makes an airplane fly , I do n't know . " Engineers , explaining the jet force which drives a plane , have compared it to the strong , sudden whip at the nozzle of a garden hose when water is turned on full force . " Most mechanics are surprised to learn that there are only eleven bolts holding the engine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very big bolts at that . In the engine there are but two main bearings and one shaft . " I can pull an engine with an inexperienced crew in 35 minutes , and four men can pull both engines and install new ones in a day . Where we used to spend five days doing a certain job on a conventional plane , we can do the same thing for a jet in a day . Where other mechanics would use 25 wrenches for a certain type of job , we generally use about five . " All the equipment necessary for changing a jet engine can be carried in the plane , and this consists of a small wing hoist and frame , and a cradle to support the engine when removed . Since the unit is so close to the ground , no work stands are necessary to reach any part of it . Mechanics invariably ask about the jet exhaust and want to know how close a person can stand in front or behind the engines , Kohler says . Most of them have heard fanciful stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of air going into the engines . And there is one story , widely told , of an officer who tried to look into the rear end and got his cap visor scorched off back to the eagle . Kohler does not believe these tales , but he does know a guy who stepped into the exhaust and was kicked back 70 feet in fast somersaults . " I 'd say a person should keep at least 200 feet behind a jet engine when it is blasting , " the sergeant recommends . " You can stand closer without getting hurt . " Once a flight is over , mechanics do n't need to let the plane cool off before beginning work on the engine . By the time they get the cowling off , the engine is cool enough to be taken out . Development of the AAF jet plane , one of the best-kept secrets of the war , took place at Muroc , Calif. , where Kohler said he signed away his life every day . " Every '  | time I turned around I was signing something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - Even the commanding officers at an AAF base near by did not know what was going on inside the restricted area of the desert . Pilots were forbidden to fly over it and no amount of rank could get a curious officer into the field . On several occasions , the jet plane was seen smoking through the sky and frantic telephone calls came from the neighboring air base notifying jet crews that a burning plane had fallen on their field . The callers were politely thanked for their concern . One afternoon , when the experimental plane was smoking heavily , the neighboring air base called out its fire and crash equipment and sent it clanging down the highway to the secret station . The crash wagons pulled up at the main gate and demanded to be let inside , drivers shouting that they had the location of a burning plane . Again , the guards were compelled to thank them quietly and politely ? and keep the gates locked . On another occasion a bird colonel became so curious that he drew himself up to full height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behind all the secrecy and mystery . A security officer had to be called out to pacify him . " Colonel , " he said , " behind those hangar walls is the hope of tomorrow . We are coming out with a gadget that will revolutionize the sewing machine . " Perhaps the simplest function of jet maintenance is servicing the plane with fuel . This is no more involved than calling the kerosene truck and filling up . The fuel is thoroughly filtered to safeguard the barometric fuel controls . These units do what the regulator on a turbo-supercharger does ? they maintain a constant power with changing altitude . The engine can operate on nearly any hydrocarbon fuel such as gasoline , kerosene , alcohol , and even hair tonic or brandy . The jet engine has about 10 percent as many moving parts as a reciprocating engine and , since there is only a rudimentary ignition system and no carburetor , there is no elaborate mixture control , nor prop control , nor icing worries . " You get all that in something they call a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take them apart and put them back , and I still ca n't find what makes them fly . Its the airplane of tomorrow ? and it smells like an old oil stove . "  |
