At Mexico City 's Central Airport a crowd of 15,000 wildly cheered the landing of a shiny , reconverted Douglas DC-3 . The big transport had just made the first flight over Mexico 's newest airline-Aerovias Braniff , S.A. <P> By modern standards Aerovias would be rated as a puny operation . It has a lone DC-3 in service , another in the shops being converted from an Army transport . Its single line from Mexico City north to Nuevo Laredo on the Rio Grande is only 569 miles long , takes only four and a half hours to fly . It will have no more planes to fly the line until it gets them from the U.S. Army . <P> But Aerovias ' competitors in Mexico know better than to judge the potential strength of their new rival by such standards . Fledgling Aerovias is backed by the million dollar fortune of able , affable Thomas E. Braniff . His American company , Braniff Airways , Inc. , is the fifth largest airline in the U.S. ( see map ) . Many Braniffmen are already on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' eager Mexican employes . <P> Pioneer Makes Good . Tom Braniff , 61 , made his fortune selling insurance in boomtown Oklahoma City . In 1927 he financed an airline from Oklahoma City to Tulsa , 120 miles away . From the day it acquired its first Stinson cabin plane , the line lost money . Soon airline , plane and deficit were taken over by Backer Braniff , in fee simple . <P> Tom Braniff searched the air transport industry for good men , sent his gangling Braniff Airways north to tap the rich traffic at Kansas City , Chicago and Denver . A businessman with a hawk eye for facts &; figures , Braniff watched his operating costs , held losses at a minimum . <P> In 1938 Braniff Airways broke into the clear , earned $28,000 profit . Last year earnings were a good $773,000 . <P> Imperialism without a Sting . Braniff planned his first foreign venture with care . Too many U.S. businessmen , he thought , have gone into foreign companies , exploited them to the last penny of profit , and pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , operated by Mexicans , and paying more than lip service to the Mexican economy . For himself he asked for a fair return on his investment , a traffic hookup between his two airlines . This brand of Yankee business easily won Mexican favor , plus route privileges to Tampico , Merida , Vera Cruz , etc . <P> When new planes are available , Aerovias has ambitious plans for expansion . In addition to more routes in Mexico , the Mexican flag line expects to push south to Panama . It will also ask the Civil Aeronautics Board for permission to land at Miami and Los Angeles . How much more Braniff will get in its own country , to add to its well-fed inland service , Braniff Airways , Inc. could predict no more accurately than the dozens of other U.S. lines ascramble for new routes . But one thing was certain : Braniff 's Mexican cousin had its start , was in competition in Mexico with big-league Pan American and American Airlines . Braniff had become an international system , too .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
