The formidably bearded Swiss musician first came to the U.S. as an orchestra leader , accompanying a dancer . When her tour folded , he wound up in Manhattan , where he used to impress friends by accompanying himself on the piano while he sang passionate cello passages from his own Schelomo . That was 30 years ago . <P> Last week , Manhattan 's Juilliard School of Music and the League of Composers combined to pay tribute to Composer Ernest Bloch . Juilliard faculty members and students played his rich , rhapsodic chamber music and orchestral compositions ( including the now famed Schelomo ) in a two-day festival . Composer Bloch , now 67 and clean-shaven , has never written any tunes that are hummed in every U.S. household . But musicians rank him , along with Stravinsky , Hindemith and Schoenberg , as the best of the European expatriates now in the U.S. Bloch knows as much about strident dissonances and spastic rhythms as the next man , but he is their master , not their servant . <P> Composer Bloch was too ill to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast to the festival , but he was not too ill to compose . He spends his days combing the beach looking for agates , and mushroom-hunting in the salal and salmonberry woods nearby . In the huge living room of his house , near a life-size woodcarving of Christ , he works nervously , but neatly , as always , on a piano concerto . He and his wife Marguerite find time to play with his half-dozen cats . Says he : " We can learn much from them . I wish they could teach me to relax . " <P> Bloch had grown up in Geneva-a Geneva seething over the Dreyfus affair-the son of a clock merchant . He studied music in Brussels , Munich and Paris , but when his father 's business went bad , he came home to help . As a child , he learned from his father the Jewish lore and emotional melodic strains that permeate his music , but he dislikes being classified , as he often is , as a racial composer . <P> A U.S. citizen since 1924 , Bloch taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco . But he wanted to compose , not teach . For a time he was subsidized by Cellist Gerald Warburg ( son of Banker Felix ) and by a wealthy San Francisco family . He retired with his wife and cats to the Oregon seaside in 1941 . There , while showing his lute-playing composer daughter how Bach used 48 themes in his Well-Tempered Clavier , he got the theme for the finale of his recent Suite Symphonique . " Suzanne and I were sitting on the little stone steps in the garden . I wrote - just like that - two pages of fugue motifs . The last one , which irritated her , is the one I used . "
