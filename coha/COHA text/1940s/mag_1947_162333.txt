By last spring the housing boom had turned into something close to a bust . By last week , it looked like a boom again . The Department of Commerce said that nearly 860,000 new dwelling units would be started this year , up more than 100,000 over predictions earlier . Next year , predicted the department , the number of starts will probably increase to 950,000 . Although industrial building is tapering , off , the department estimates that the total volume of new construction will be $15.2 billion , about 20% above this year . ( Half of the increase will be due to higher prices . ) <P> To the building industry the outlook did not seem so rosy . The Producers ' Council , Inc. , a national organization of manufacturers of building materials and equipment , put the increase in starts next year at only 40,000 units . Thomas S. Holden , president of the F. W. Dodge Corp. , the construction industry 's top factfinders , guessed even lower . The dollar volume of residential building , he predicted , would rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be somewhat less because of the rise in building prices . <P> Prices Down ? Did anyone think prices would go down ? The most optimistic observation came from Robert W. McChesney , president of the National Electrical Contractors Association . At a meeting of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 's construction industry advisory council , McChesney said that " the price of houses seems to have reached a plateau and there is a reasonable expectancy that the price will decline . " <P> Despite the pickup in building , Standard &; Poor 's Corp . estimated that the U.S. was still falling behind its needs . The demand for new houses is currently growing at the rate of more than 1,000,000 dwelling units a year . <P> Triple Up ? Nevertheless , members of the National Apartment Owners Association who met in Cleveland to plot a campaign against rent controls talked as if the housing shortage were over . Why , said one delegate from Boston , he knew of 18 apartments for rent in the top brackets-and right in Boston , too . <P> A common lament of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were now making enough money to live alone in apartments formerly occupied by two or three . Removal of controls , said real estate men , would force tenants to double up again . " In Los Angeles , " said John E. Owens , the association 's president-elect , " housing could be provided for at least 80,000 more persons by removal of controls . There are simply too many people occupying space they do n't need . A rent increase would take care of a lot of that . "
