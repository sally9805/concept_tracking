Old Satchel Paige took one long , pleased look at the 78,382 fans . Said Satch : " I should be working on percentage . " The crowd that jammed Cleveland 's Municipal Stadium last week was the largest in major-league night baseball . All Cleveland had come to see 1948 's biggest drawing card pitch the league-leading Indians into their eighth straight victory . <P> Satchel , who might have ranked with such major-league greats as Mathewson , Walsh and Johnson had he been born white , and given a big-league chance before he was 44 , was too good a showman to disappoint a crowd like that . Sticking mainly to his fast ball against the last-place Chicago White Sox , Paige worked with the kind of control that is almost a lost art among modern pitchers . He walked only one , struck out five , let only two runners get past first , won his fifth victory , 1-0 . <P> Slender Lead . It was the fourth consecutive shutout by Manager Lou Boudreau 's Indians , tying a league record set by Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Said he , matter-of-factly : " I 'm getting back in shape . " But it would take more than Satch Paige in shape for Cleveland to clinch its first pennant in 28 years . The Indians promptly dropped three in a row to the White Sox , and hung precariously to their lead . <P> This week , only three games separated the four first-division American League clubs . The . invisible wires that held up ancient Connie Mack 's Philadelphia Athletics had unraveled a bit ; the A 's dropped from second to fourth , behind the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees . Manager Bucky Harris had desperately shaken up his in &; out Yankees after losing four straight games ( the new first baseman : Outfielder Tommy Henrich ) , and sent to Newark for 24-year-old Pitcher Bob Porterfield . Rookie Porterfield won two of his first three games . <P> Rags to Riches . In the National League , the race was just as tight , the scrambling just as fierce . Back in July , the first-place Boston Braves had a comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's champions , grumbled in last place . Fourteen days later the Dodgers , already on the way back , switched from loud Manager Leo Durocher to patient Burt Shotton , and kept going . Last week , in an Ebbets Field doubleheader that had some of the tenseness and all the excitement of a World Series , the rags-to-riches Bums beat the Braves in the opener , 8-7 , and seized first place amid pandemonium in the bleachers . A couple of hours later , amid more pandemonium , the Braves took it back , 2-1 , and Brooklyn 's bright blue banner was hauled down . One big reason why it was too soon to count the faltering Braves out : Shortstop Alvin Dark , whose fat .331 batting average , made him a likely Rookie-of-the-Year . <P> Right alongside the Dodgers this week were the St. Louis Cardinals , thanks mainly to a modest young outfielder named Stan Musial , who owns the league 's most sensational batting average ( .381 ) and also leads the league in runs batted in ( 95 ) , hits , runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the incurably partisan and the bold were making any bets on who would play in the World Series .
