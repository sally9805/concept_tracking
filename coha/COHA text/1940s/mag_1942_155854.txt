In the sub-basement of Washington 's old House Office Building , a tall greying man with intense eyes and a lean , unsmiling face prayed for drought . Edward Page Gaston , brother of anti-cigaret Crusader Lucy Page Gaston , hoped that World War II would bring Prohibition II . <P> As founder and U.S. director of the World Prohibition Federation , Brother Gaston is a spokesman for the W.C.T.U. , the Anti-Saloon League and some 100 other temperance societies . He has kneeling space in the House Office Building by permission of his good friend Ulysses S. Guyer , dry Congressman from dry Kansas , who rises occasionally on the House floor to tack ( so far , in vain ) a prohibition joker on to other legislation . <P> Last week Guyer , Gaston and like-minded men &; women throughout the land saw war move their goal closer . In Congress were a half-dozen bills to regulate alcohol traffic . One of them , a Senate resolution which would prohibit liquor sales in &; around military establishments , could conceivably be used ( by a Prohibitionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . <P> In Washington 's New York Avenue Presbyterian Church , Brother Gaston announced a " sweeping national campaign " for wartime prohibition . He gave alcohol a large share of the blame for the fall of France and the Pearl Harbor tragedy , concluded hopefully that " America should soon be dry again , and next time Prohibition will come to stay as a success . " Congressional mimeograph machines , by courtesy of Guyer , scattered his message over the U.S. <P> A more imminent threat to U.S. drinkers was the Office of Production Management , which pondered an order requiring distilleries to switch to industrial alcohol needed for munitions and plastics ( see p. 61 ) . Hopeful note for tipplers : even if all whiskey production were stopped immediately , stocks now aging in warehouses would last four years .
