But there is another kind that , like differential calculus and other forms of honest brainwork , has a permanent beauty worth a closer look . Of all living writers , none has done more as a critic to keep this distinction clear or more as a poet to illustrate it than bush-bearded , 42-year-old Englishman William Empson , who now lives by choice in Peiping . For years Empson 's work has been admired by people who would put their minds on it , and either ignored or jeered at by a greater number who gave it a fast superficial reading .

Strictly constructed and packed with systematic puns , it has the mass and polish and concealed energy of a jacketed turbine .
