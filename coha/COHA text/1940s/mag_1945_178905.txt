Shortly before he died , Franklin Roosevelt asked Dr. Vannevar Bush to blueprint a new deal for U.S. science . Last week the chief of the wartime scientific high command dropped his blueprint on President Truman 's desk . The plan , drafted by Dr. Bush and four committees composed of leading U.S. scientists , would require the Federal Government to spend some $122,500,000 a year to support basic scientific research and the education of young scientists . <P> Their plan : <P> Government grants , amounting eventually to $90,000,000 a year , * to universities , medical schools and research institutes for long-range research . <P> Federal science scholarships for 6,000 undergraduates and 300 graduate students each year. + <P> An immediate comb-out by the Army &; Navy of all uniformed personnel with scientific training or aptitude ( perhaps 100,000 ) for assignment to schools to complete their scientific education . <P> Prompt release from censorship of all scientific military secrets which no longer involve security ( for a step already taken in that direction , see below ) . <P> U.S. leadership in international exchange of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignment of scientific attaches to U.S. embassies abroad . <P> Appointment by the President of a National Research Foundation to guide U.S. science . <P> In favor of this plan Dr. Bush and associates offered some stern arguments : despite vast expenditures on wartime research ( $720,000,000 in 1944 alone ) , the U.S. is on the brink of scientific bankruptcy . Reason : it has used up its backlog of basic scientific knowledge . During the war U.S. scientists , drafted almost to a man for work on new weapons , gadgets , drugs , etc. , have done virtually no basic research . Moreover , the U.S. , unlike every other great power , has stopped training young scientists : Dr. Bush 's group estimates that the war will cost the nation 167,000 potential scientists and doctors who would otherwise have got degrees . <P> Wanted : A National Policy . Although the U.S. is the world 's No. 1 technological power , most of the fundamental scientific discoveries on which its technology has been based originated in Europe . Even in prewar years , U.S. laboratories spent nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science . In contrast , the British , for example , spent almost as much on pure science as on technology . <P> Said Bush 's group : the U.S. must adopt a " national policy for science " forthwith if it hopes to 1 ) keep abreast of other nations in military research , 2 ) " get ahead " in international trade , 3 ) achieve full employment . Bush 's scientists unanimously agreed that this could be accomplished only by federal subsidy . Among those who concurred in his report were representatives of the Bell Telephone Laboratories , Standard Oil of Indiana , Du Pont . <P> <P> *$20,000,000 for national defense , $50,000,000 in the natural sciences , $20,000,000 in medicine . A bill to carry out the Bush plan was introduced in the U.S. Senate last week by Senator Warren Magnuson of Washington .
