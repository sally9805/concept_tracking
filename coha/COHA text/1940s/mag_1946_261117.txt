An impatient man has no business in a photographic darkroom , but if one should find himself there , Eastman Kodak is ready to ease his dank tedium . Ready last week were two new fast-action print papers : Resisto N for contact prints , Resisto Rapid for enlargements . <P> Print papers have a gelatinous silver emulsion on a tough paper base . In the Resisto papers the base is impregnated with an acetate which makes it practically waterproof . Developing , fixing and washing solutions are thus absorbed by the emulsion only . Using Resisto , photographers need take only two minutes for fixing , four minutes for washing , three minutes for drying their prints . The results , says Eastman , are durable .
