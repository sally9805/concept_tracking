" Only a man harrowing clods . . . " wrote Poet Thomas Hardy . " Yet this will go onward the same though Dynasties pass . . . . War 's annals will fade ... ere their story die " <P> Across Iowa 's rich checkerboard of farm lands , men shucked the last of the hog-fattening corn , shaved the empty yellowed stalks from their fields , plowed the brown earth . <P> Last week they took time off . Men who work with the earth take pride not only in production but in the way the job is done . On the Henry Keppy farm near Davenport , 125,000 farmers and their families gathered to see how the job was done by the best of them at the annual national cornhusking contest . <P> As a curtain raiser for the huskers was a plowman 's match , an innovation on the program , held on the neighboring Denger farm . The straightest furrows , the neatest turns with a tractor-drawn plow were made by Fred Timbers , who had traveled from Ontario to show what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international champion of plowmen . <P> Next day , 21 local champions from eleven States lined up in the Keppy cornfield to wait the starting bomb in the husking contest . Favored by fence-row experts to win were Marion Link , Iowa State champion , Ecas Vaughan , Illinois State champion , Irving Bauman , also from Illinois , runner-up in the nationals in 1935 and 1938 . The contestants , some of them stripped to the waist , sweated up &; down the corn rows , snatching off the dried ears , husking them with a hook strapped to the wrist , flinging them against the " bang-boards " of tractor-drawn wagons . <P> Eighty minutes later time was called . The contestants were panting , splotched with blood from cutting themselves on stiff corn leaves . Judges pawed over the wagonloads , deducted gleanings , weighed the results , announced that Irving Bauman had set a new record of 46.71 bushels , had won the 1940 national championship . Second : Marion Link , whose 46.36 bushels also topped the old record of 41.52 . <P> The 125,000 farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sac and Fox reservations , with a slow , critical eye looked over farm implements on display at the Keppy farm , grinned at a map of Iowa made of over a million corn kernels . But what they really liked best were Irving Bauman 's 46.71 bushels of husked corn . Plowman Timbers ' neat turns and straight rows .
