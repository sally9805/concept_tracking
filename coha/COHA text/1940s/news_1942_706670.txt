txt Wireless to THE NEW YORK TIMES . LONDON , Aug. ** changes in the Middle East Command were announced today by the British War Office within twenty-four hours of the announcement that Prime Minister Winston Churchill had visited Cairo on the way to Moscow to discuss war plans with Premier Joseph Stalin . They are regarded here as further evidence that Transcaucasia and the Mediterranean had an important place in the Kremlin talks , which was attended by General Sir Archibald Wavell , British commander in India . According to the announcement made here today , General Sir Claude J. E. Auchinleck has been replaced by General Sir Harold R. L. G. Alexander , 50-year-old hero of Dunkerque and the Burma fighting . One of the most interesting points about this is the failure of the communique to give the slightest clue regarding General Auchinleck 's next assignment . As there is no reason to suppose Mr. Churchill has lost any of his confidence in him , it is reasonable to // ALEXANDER TAKES AUCHINLEC1CS POST // suppose the former commander in chief in the Middle East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gen. B. L. Montgomery , who commanded the Eighth Division in Palestine before the war , when strife broke out between Jews and Arabs , has received command of the Eighth Army , of which Lieut . Gen. Neil M. Ritchie was relieved after the disastrous Libyan campaign . Major General Herbert Lumsden , former amateur Grand National rider , has been appointed commander of the Thirtieth Corps , succeeding Lieut . Gen. W. H. E. Gott , recently killed when his plane was shot down . General Lumsden , who is onlyt 45 years old , is regarded as a " find of the war . " He is an expert in mechanized warfare and with twenty tanks held up the Germans north of Dunkerque for two days while the evacuation was completed . It is assumed that Mr. Churchill discussed the changes he had in mind with those responsible for the operations in the Middle East during his visit to Cairo .

There is precedent for General Auchinleck 's replacement without prejudice in his own appointment in succession to General Wave11 , who took over command in India . With the announcement of the change in the Middle Eastern command came the disclosure that , while visiting Egypt , Mr. Churchill went up to the El Alamein front . There he met brigade and divisional commanders and inspected men of Australian and South African divisions . He wore a tropical suit and helmet on his visit to the front , and pictures published here show him talking to Field Marshal Jan Christiaan Smuts , Premier of the Union of South Africa , wearing what looks like a real American ten-gallon hat  --  a souvenir , perhaps , of one of his visits to President Roosevelt . It was only natural that , before visiting Premier Stalin , Mr. Churchill wished to make a personal survey of the situation in the Middle East , where many believe some of the most important battles of the war will be fought .

As the Germans approach Transcaucasia the part to be played by the Allied armies in Syria , Palestine , Iran and Iraq becomes more important . The British forces in Palestine and Syria , it is said , are now in a fine state of efficiency , and there is a large Polish force equipped by the United States and Britain completing its training . Northward are Russian reserve armies trained by Marshal Klementy E. Voroshiloff awaiting the moment to strike back but held out of the struggle now as Premier Stalin withheld reserves last Autumn until a perfectly timed thrust saved Moscow . Although Russia has had to yield huge and rich territories this Summer the Red Army has been preserved as a strong , coherent striking force .

It has been suggested that the Prime Minister might broadcast to the nation , but he is too strict a parliamentarian to overlook his obligation to report first to the House of Commons . It is apparent , moreover , that both his exchange of views with Mr. Stalin and his Cairo conversations were almost entirely strategic , and there is little , therefore , that Mr. Churchill could tell the House about them either at a public or private session . The mere announcement of his visit to the Kremlin , however , has caused considerable uplifting of the spirits of the people here , who feel that now ' at last something is going to be done toward smashing Adolf Hitler and the Nazis . This feeling seems general throughout the United Nations , judging from dispatches from all over the empire and Allied capitals . Axis comment is understandably sarcastic .
