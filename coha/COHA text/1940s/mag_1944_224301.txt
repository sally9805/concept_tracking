Broadway has been having a busy June but a bad one . The " silly season " has sprouted comedies that lack even a silly seasoning of wit , farces more like new forms of torture , a beer- &-pretzel; extravaganza at which the vile acoustics became a virtue . Most of these walking corpses already lie in their little graves .
