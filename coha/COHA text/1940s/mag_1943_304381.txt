When the " father draft " bill became law , the Army won a point of prestige , Manpowerman Paul McNutt lost political face , and U.S. fathers broke even . <P> The Draw . Montana 's Senator Burton K. Wheeler had fought for a sharp-toothed bill which would save every pre-Pearl Harbor father from the draft until the last childless man in the U.S. had been inducted . As finally amended and signed by the President , the bill was well-intentioned and toothless : fathers will be kept at the bottom of draft lists so long as this does not affect " the orderly flow of men into the armed forces . " <P> To protect fathers , single men in so-called " essential jobs " will be reconsidered as possible draftees . The lists of 3.6 million 4-Fs will be combed again-just in case there are any almost-healthy men who might , after all , make adequate soldiers . A new five-man medical board will be set up to try to lower the Army 's physical standards . But whenever the Army needs young &; healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Major General Lewis B. Hershey , who formerly reported ( on paper ) to WMC 's McNutt , became full boss of Selective Service . He had never favored the idea of a sharp-toothed father draft bill . Last week General Hershey told a manufacturers ' convention in Manhattan that the Army would probably need and would have to take another 1,000,000 fathers by July 1944 . Next day he wired all local boards to go easy on family men . <P> The Loser . Grey , glossy Paul McNutt had stubbornly fought the bill because it would " sabotage " his so-called overall manpower program . The President 's signature was a staggering blow to the man who gave up his almost-sure nomination as the 1940 Vice-Presidential candidate in favor of Mr. Roosevelt 's man Wallace . <P> The Washington Times-Herald reported that sympathetic friends were " bleeding for McNutt . " But Paul McNutt kept silence ; did not resign . <P> And he could console himself thus : he had merely been stripped of sweeping powers which he never really had .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
