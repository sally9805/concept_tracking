Outside the offices of Rio 's Communist Tribune-Popular , the pavement was white with paper , littered with broken desks , smashed typewriters . Just three and a half hours after the Brazilian Foreign Office announced the diplomatic break with Russia , a slug-happy gang of rowdies had broken into the Tribunals plant . They whanged sledge hammers against the presses , later smashed up the editorial offices . Though the press room is only about 300 yards from Rio 's central police station , the wreckers had the place to themselves for two hours . When a squad of military police showed up , the cops did nothing but stand and watch . <P> Most Brazilians had approved the Soviet break ( TIME , Oct. 27 ) , and thousands of them gathered before Catete Palace to cheer President Dutra 's explanation for it . But the Tribune , smash-up went against the Brazilian sense of justice and fair play . Next day the entire Rio press condemned both the police and the rowdies . <P> The Brazilian Congress seemed to agree with Rio 's press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude toward Russia , " cried Senator Ivo de Aquino , " but that does not mean we condone acts of violence against any organization , particularly against the press , which by our laws is guaranteed full liberty . " Following the outlawing of the Communist Party , Senator de Aquino had sponsored the Government 's controversial bill to toss Communist jobholders out of elective office . Now that bill faced a tough battle . <P> The afternoon of the Tribuna attack , hooligans tore down the Soviet Embassy 's shield . Moscow translated the incident into a " stoning " of the embassy , put Brazilian Ambassador Mario de Pimentel Brandao and his entourage of nine under hotel arrest . Only when the Rio Soviet Embassy staff of 32 were safely off for Montevideo would Pimentel &; friends get exit visas .
