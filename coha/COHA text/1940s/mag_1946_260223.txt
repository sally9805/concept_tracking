In the wings a piano played softly Ponchielli 's Dance of the Hours . A squatty ballerina in pink &; white tarlatan waddled across the broad , bare stage with the grace of an angry duck , poised herself on her toes in the manner of Alicia Markova and executed a series of shaky pirouettes . To no music at . all she leaped through the air and beat her chest in an athletic agony that was unmistakably Martha Graham . <P> A young and mischievous dancer named Iva Kitchell had rented Manhattan 's 2,700-seat Carnegie Hall with considerable misgivings last week . But dance fans almost filled the place . Wrote the New York Times 's dance critic John Martin : " If Miss Kitchell has her eye on Madison Square Garden , her friends need feel no qualms . . . . She . . . ought to be compelled to travel about the country on the trail of the various ballet companies to restore sanity . " <P> Tiny ( 5 ft. 1 in . ) Iva Kitchell , 27 , has mastered the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opera ballet company at 14 , aped the ballerinas backstage so mercilessly that her ballet master suggested she turn comedienne . She has since appeared in almost every small Manhattan dance auditorium except the Young Men 's Hebrew Association . ( " I was never asked . I suppose because I 'm not pure dance . I 'm an impure dancer . " ) <P> Seek &; Search . Iva Kitchell has nothing against any school of dancing ( " I just think there 's something completely ridiculous about anything that 's too serious " ) . In one dance ( called Oriental Dance by an Occidental Girl ) she flips her fingers and toes and picks up a handkerchief with her teeth . But she shines in Soul in Search , satirizing the Dark Meadows dance in which Martha Graham rolls herself up in a black cloth which seems to symbolize the labyrinths of a frustrated libido . As Iva Kitchell , hopelessly mired in yards of purple muslin , thrashes about on the floor , she suddenly calls out : " Who am I-that seeks and searches and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where shall I search ? . . . Is it here where I am-or am I ? Is it there ? . . . " Soon she is crawling about the stage on her hands and knees , sobbing : " I seek and search . Seek . Search . Seek . Search . " Then , happily , she suddenly trots offstage , shouting , " I will go into the fertile fields ! " <P> Says impious Iva Kitchell : " I think Martha Graham is a fine artist , although I did think it was pretty funny when she got under that piece of cloth . "
