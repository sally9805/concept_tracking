George Bernard Shaw , 85 , had himself a say on great matters of his ninth decade . To questions submitted by Cavalcade he submitted answers which , Cavalcade noted , " may not seem particularly useful to the Cabinet . . . . Neither he , nor we , supposed that they would . " <P> Q. " What would you do if you were in Mr. Churchill 's place ... in regard to ( a ) the influences which operate against . . . free and full ... aid to Russia , ( b ) the growing body of popular feeling which demands . . . action ? " <P> A. " Put me in it , and I shall know but probably not tell you . There are no intelligent influences operating against all the aid to Russia we can afford . That aid is as clearly the obvious policy for Colonel Moore-Brabazon as for Mr. William Gallacher . . . . When the war ends these gentlemen will split in all directions , as Mr. Churchill admits , but until then every enemy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " What action ? The alternatives are : I ) seizure of the Channel and North Sea ports , involving considerable damage to our Allies ; 2 ) launching an Indian army , potentially 30 million strong , at the Germans from the east ; 3 ) smashing the Axis by a ruthless conquest of Italy . . . . <P> " Mr. Churchill has given more than a hint that he is for No. 2 . That , I suspect , would be my own choice . . . . The Moslems of North-west India are the Protestant Boys of the East , as convinced as any Belfast Orangemen that the Protestant Boys shall carry the Drum , and much better fighters , I should say , than either we or the Germans . They think so themselves . <P> " No. 3 is esthetically objectionable and uselessly mischievous . Our Philistine rulers can not imagine that esthetic considerations can enter into foreign policy or military tactics ; but that is just their ignorance . " <P> Q. " Do you think the financial and economic system of Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , what measures would you advocate to replace it . . . ? " <P> A. " Financial systems are in continual flux , and do n't survive anyhow , war or no war . Economic systems all depend on the balance of power between the holders of private property with their parasites and the really productive proletariat . Mr. Churchill and Mr. Anthony Eden are for private property and oligarchy . Stalin is for public property and democracy . So am I. Therefore , I can not give you an unbiased opinion . All I can tell you is that when the war is over there will be wigs on the green . "
