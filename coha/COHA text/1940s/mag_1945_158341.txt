One hundred million countrymen : The enemy now stands at our front gate . It is indeed the gravest moment in the history of our nation . . . . We must either win . . . or we shall all die . . . . The time is here for the . . . people of Japan to man their posts . . . and make secure the divine country of his Imperial Majesty , the Emperor . <P> Thus the twangy voice of Japan 's Singing Frog , Premier General Kuniaki Koiso , croaked through the nightmare of bombs , flames , death and flight that engulfed his country . He did not exaggerate . <P> In Tokyo , once the world 's third largest city , more than 3,000,000 of the 7,000,000 inhabitants ( according to official broadcasts ) had been evacuated or killed . Three other big cities - Osaka , Kobe , Nagoya - had been similarly scourged . <P> How long could the nation hold out against the incendiary typhoon ? Not long , thought some . There were rumors of peace bids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever war-weariness might have come to industrialists whose factories were gutted and to civilians whose paper- &-bamboo; homes were obliterated , had by no means had enough . Premier Koiso and his fanatical War Minister , Field Marshal . Gen Sugijama , drafted another emergency measure , pushed it through another emergency Diet . It ordered : <P> Mobilization of a National Volunteer Army - the Jap version of the Nazi Volkssturm - to include all save " the aged , the sick , the very young and pregnant women . " <P> Confiscation of any " land , buildings and materials " for military works . <P> Redistribution of food and munitions for " an area-by-area defense structure . " <P> Virtual martial law for the entire home land . <P> Then one of the Army 's prime morale boosters , Major General Chuon Sakurai , rallied his countrymen . We must follow the example of Frederick the Great , he radiorated . " Regardless of victory or de feat , " the Prussian king " always put his hand on his chest . . . . Without uselessly indulging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should calmly place our hand upon our chest and think . . . that our efforts are not yet sufficient . "
