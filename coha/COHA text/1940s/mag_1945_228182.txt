Germans insisted it was an old Bavarian drinking song . Americans and British thought it was one of their own . Anyhow , they all sang it . The Beer Barrel Polka became the Tipperary of World War II , rivaled in popularity only by Lili Marlene , which had more homesick appeal , but less oompah . <P> The unknown little man who actually wrote Polka turned up in the news last week . He is a village orchestra leader named Jaromir Vejvoda , from the tiny Prague suburb of Vrane . In 1930 , when he was 28 , Vejvoda scribbled down Modran-ska Polka ( his first composition ) for his small stringed orchestra which played in the village park . Only in 1934 did he let it be published and words set to it . One Vasek Zeman retitled it Skoda Lasky ( Jilted Love ) and wrote these sob-saccharine lyrics in Czech : <P> Roses are blooming , what for , <P> Nobody can help me any more , <P> They bloom , they wither , their leaves fall off , <P> Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even with such lyrics , the song pulled through . It became a hit , with just as sobby words , in Germany as Rosamunde , in Denmark as Skon en min Kone , in Sweden as Ut i Naturen . <P> In Manhattan , Tin Pan Alleysmiths Shapiro-Bernstein heard a recording of Jilted Love in 1938 , hired Songwriter Lew Brown to write some words that would bounce like the music . Result : the Polka 's now familiar " Roll out the barrel " lyrics . <P> By the time Bohemia was blacked out by war , Vejvoda had already collected sizable royalties . Polka sold more than a half million copies in the U.S. alone . <P> <P> Everybody was sure that the Andrews Sisters had done it to death-but military bands took it up again . During the war , it brought in money by the barrel ; big U.S. and British royalties now await him . <P> Innkeeper 's Delight . Composer Vejvoda , 43 and balding , now runs a pleasant plaster inn on the banks of the Vltava . In his prosperity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time Composer Vejvoda heard Lyricist Lew Brown 's malty English lyrics translated by a U.S. newsman . As he drew beers for customers in his inn , he smiled appreciatively . " You know , those are better words for a song written by an innkeeper , " he told the newsman . " Have another one on the house ? "
