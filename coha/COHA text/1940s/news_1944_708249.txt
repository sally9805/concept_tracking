txt THREE OPINIONS UNDER POSTAGE To The Music Edttor : It is gratifying to find many of the great orchestras paying tribute to Arnold Schoenberg this year . would like to say three cheers to Dr. Rodzinski and the Philharmonic-Symphony for its excellent performance of the " Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte " Sunday afternoon ! It is hard for me to understand why it is that Schoenberg , the man who has perhaps influenced the trend of music writing today more than any other living composer , has been given so few public performances . I , for one , am all for more and more of it . The " Ode " was a particularly fine selection for the orchestra to present , not only because it is Schoenberg at his most appealing , but even more because Byron 's poem has such significance today . The par- allel between Napoleon and Hitler is one we ought not forget . AN NE HOUSTON . Brooklyn , N. Y.
