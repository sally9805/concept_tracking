For the first time , a Liberal M.P . said it out loud : Prime Minister King was worn out and ready to retire before long . <P> The speaker was a chipper , chubby French Canadian named Antoine Phileas Cot , a freshman M.P . but an old hand at politics . Over radio station CJBR at Rimouski , Que. , Cot said flatly that the Prime Minister , after his severe bout with a cold , looked " old and worn out . " " Mr. King , " he said , " wants a Liberal Party convention before his retirement , " so that a successor may be chosen . " I believe that this convention will take place in 1948 , probably in Montreal . " <P> Quebecker Cot , onetime political reporter ( Montreal 's La Patrie and Le Canada ) , ticked off the men he thought most likely to succeed : 1 ) Defense Minister Brooke Claxton , 48 , who is the " heir presumptive " ; 2 ) Finance Minister Douglas Abbott , 47 , " whose affability makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Minister Paul Martin , 43 , " whose . . . eloquence and ambition make him a candidate " ; 4 ) Agriculture Minister James G. Gardiner , 63 , " a first-class organizer " ; 5 ) External Affairs Under Secretary Lester ( " Mike " ) Pearson , 49 , who " leads all the dark horses by manylengths . " <P> What of External Affairs Minister Louis S. St. Laurent , 65 ? Maybe , said Cot- " if he were ten years younger or if he wanted the job . " And what of Justice Minister ( and ex-Finance Minister ) James L. Ilsley , 53 ? Cot 's answer : " His goose is cooked . ... He was the wartime taxer. "
