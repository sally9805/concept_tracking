txt The Vichy government today " is a German government " that no longer can exist when French armies enter France , General Henri Honore Giraud declared in an interview today with this correspondent . General Giraud 's unequivocal statement of opposition to Vichy followed his dramatic speech Sunday , which is generally regarded here as the turning point in the , tangle of North African politics . The general impressed this correspondent as the strongest , most disinterested and most sincere of the French leaders he has seen . General Giraud talked frankly but tersely about North African politics , about the strategic situation and about the need of French North ' African armies for equipment . He said that he did not believe Germany could endure another Winter of war and declared that a landing in Southern Europe ? following the conclusion of the Tunisian campaign  --  would have " inestimable results . " In the past week this correspondent has interviewed General Charles Nogues , Resident General of Morocco ; General Alphonse F. Juin and Marcel R. Peyrouton , Governor General of Algeria . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of them has the calm self-confidence and obvious strength bordering on stubbornness that characterize General Giraud . The general appeared far // GIRAIJD SEES TIME RIPE TO HIT REICH // younger than his years . He carries himself with military erectness . There is no hint of age in his voice or glance or bearing , and he is decisive and concise in all that he says . He sat behind a carvedwood desk here and talked of the political and military problems that confront him . His statement of complete opposition to Vichy was followed by the declaration that his Sunday speech  --  which promised abrogation of the discriminatory Nuremberg laws in North Africa  --  would be implemented legislatively by a series of decrees " as soon as possible . " He emphasized , however , that abrogation of the Cremieux laws of 1870 , which conferred French citizenship upon Algerian Jews , would not be revoked , because both Arab and Jewish residents of North Africa must be placed on the same franchise footing . There are about 8,000,000 Arabs in North Africa and about 220,000 Jews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than two years through the aid of the powerful enemy propaganda machine that if Germany loses the war the Arabs will be ruled by Jews . The Arab majority and the Jewish minority must receive equal rights , he said ; the Cremieux decree , as well as decrees issued by the Vichy government , were discriminatory to either majority or minority and hence had no place in North African politics of tomorrow . The general emphasized that declarations made in his Sunday speech  --  and the decrees that are to follow it ? implied no change in the local franchise ; three types of local councils  --  municipal , financial and general  --  which are elective bodies , will continue to be elected as before . Estimates German Strength Turning from political and economic problems to the military situation the general said Germany was not yet " at the end of her rope . " Although she has lost many men and much material , he said , he believed she had strength enough left to finish the year . " But I do not believe she can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagrees , he said , with those ? probably in the majority here  --  who think Germany still has another March , 1918 , offensive in her system . He thought the enemy could launch local offensives and because of the strength of her fortifications on the western coast of Europe could impose great casualties upon us if we were to attack the enemy in that area . But the successful conclusion of the Tunisian campaign , he said , would have great effects in Italy , and an Allied landing in Southern Europe would have " inestimable results " upon the entire strategy of the war . The general emphasized and reiterated the importance of equipping as rapidly as possible a French North African army of 300,000 men . General Giraud 's recent statements , the resignations of General Jean - Marie - Joseph Bergeret as Deputy Civil Commander of French North Africa and Jean Rigaud as Secretary of Political Affairs andl the probable eventual replacement of General Nogues , plus the lifting of discriminatory laws , have done ranch to clear the political air here . But in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be paralleled by an economic and military crisis , which may have a major effect upon the political situation . The end of the rainy season is at hand ; the intensification of fighting in Tunisia is to be expected at any , time , . and from now on until Tune the economic situation of North Africa may become much . worse . ' Last Sunday 's closing of butcher shops because of a meat shortage was only temporary . It was relieved yesterday by the release of 140 tons of Army corned ? beef to the native population , and unless something can be done to get hoarded wheat into circulation a serious wheat and bread shortage may develop . Food is a major problem for the civilian population of North Africa . Eliminating the Germans from Tu ? nisia is a military problem . Both are dependent for their solution upon transportation , primarily trucks and gasoline . The political situation has passes one crisis . The economic situation and military situation ' are approaching their major crises . ? The beginnings of political victories that can now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrees of General Giraud can not be verified and can not reach their full consummation until military and economic victories are achieved , the Germans pushed into the Mediterranean and the specters of hunger and deprivation eliminated from North Africa .
