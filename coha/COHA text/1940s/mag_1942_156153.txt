Two methods in war surgery-one for saving limbs , the other for amputating them-were reported at the A.M.A. meeting last week . <P> &gt; Standard treatment for wounds in World War II is to trim off all dying flesh , enclose the limb or trunk in an old-fashioned plaster cast , leave the cast undisturbed for many weeks until the wound has healed . This closed plaster method prevents many an amputation , reduces infection to a minimum , allows soldiers to be moved with no ill effects . Only drawback : after a week or so the wounds develop a foul stench . Last week Dr. Allan Dinsmore Wallis and Researcher Margaret J. Dilworth of Philadelphia told how they prevented the smell by simply placing lactose ( milk sugar ) solution on wounds before enclosing them in plaster . Apparently , said the scientists , the lactose provides food for harmless bacteria in the wounds , prevents them from causing putrefaction . <P> &gt; Quickest , simplest , safest method of amputation on the battlefield , said Colonel Norman Thomas Kirk of the U.S. Army , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The word ' guillotine , ' " said Colonel Kirk , " is a misnomer . The circular guillotine amputation is not a ' chop ' operation . " It consists of cutting around the skin of the limb , waiting a moment for it to draw back , then cutting around the connective tissue , waiting again for withdrawal , cutting through the muscles circularly , and finally sawing the bone . The old practice of covering the bone with flaps of skin has been abandoned ; the stump is sprinkled with sulfanilamide , left exposed so that there is no closed pocket for bacteria to breed in . Later on , the skin is pulled down over the bone .
