MACINTOSH TELLS ME A Story JOHN BELL CLAYTON I RODE MacIntosh up under the Balancing Rock and around the hill and when we got to the creek I told MacIntosh to wait because he had trouble on the footlog and I walked across the footlog and went into the store where it smelled like old overshoes and persimmons and Joe Garber said , " No ! No positively ! Over my dead and prostrate body ! " I said , " You want Papa to buy you out , do n't you ? " Joe Garber just kept on looking at me . I said , " You do n't want me to tell Papa about Macintosh 's little brother , do you ? " Joe began to sweat and finally he said , " All right ! Only do n't be sweet ! Sherman did n't burn up Georgia because he was mad or mean  --  he just got fed up with you Rebels being sweet . " Joe stooped over and yanked open the trap door and fished the box up out of the cold creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with the cloth and handed it to me and said , " Wallow in it . Live in it . " I wish I could , I thought  --  I wish I could hurry Papa into buying Joe 's store for four thousand dollars so I could have all the strawberry pop I want every day the rest of my life . Across the creek Macintosh mooed twice and I said , " Macintosh wants one too . " " MacIntosh kabosh ! " Joe said . " Stop trying to make out that calf can talk . It gives me the creeps . " I said , " How do you suppose I found out about you creeping up on Macintosh 's little brother that moonlight night and catching him and eating him all up ? " " Hush up ! " Joe Garber said , the sweat running down his face . " I 've told you a thousand times he got caught in a barbed wire fence and a tree fell on him and broke all four legs and otherwise mangled him pitifully and I put him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joe reached down and flung open the trap door again and took out another one and gave it to me and I took it out to give to Macintosh but MacIntosh shook his head that he was n't thirsty and I drank that one too and when I came back Joe asked , " How many is that now ? " " Eighty-seven , " I said . J OE grabbed the daybook and pencil stub off the shelf under the counter . He put down two more marks . He stuck the pencil stub in his mouth like a cigar . He took it out again and went over the figures like Papa 's Ford bouncing up and down on the road to Deer Meadow . He slammed the daybook shut and looked at me again . " How do you know things like that ? You six , seven years old . You ai n't old enough to count that high . " " MacIntosh helps me , " I said . Joe shut his eyes . He was sweating some . " Iiush , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you going to start making some progress with your papa on this transaction ? " " Pretty soon , " I said . " Any day now . " " 1 ca n't live on promises , " Joe said . " Give me something cancrete while I 'm waiting . " He shut his fat fists and pounded them on the counter until the ball gum jiggled in the big glass jar . " Give me something I can put my hands on ! " I took the egg out of my right pocket and the egg out of my left pocket and put them on the counter beside the wrapping paper roll . Joe picked up the eggs and shook them and moved around the counter and opened the screen door and pitched them into the creek . " Is your imagination fading ? " Joe asked . " Have you reached this point of your career only to find your resourcefulness exhausted ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " There are times when you get strictly persona non gratis with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't much oblige me . That 's not a compliment . You 've got me across a barrel but you 've got to come down out of the clouds and pay your way along . I have n't got any guarantee you 'll ever clinch this deal ? " " I 'll weed your garden , " I said . " No ! " said Joe Garber like I 'd said something awful . He put his elbows on the counter and breathed hot in my face . " Remember last year ? " " I 'm not sure , " / said . " It 's hard to go back that far . " " All over Europe people are suffering from want . I try to do things for the race . I set out a fine ambitious garden and you weed it and Macintosh comes along behind and makes it look like this is where they tested the atom bomb . Be practical ! " " Macintosh did n't know about the people in Europe , " I said . " Jesse James Junior ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy ! How many cattle has your papa got altogether ? " " Sixteen hundred and thirty-nine , " I said , " counting Macintosh and his little brother that you crept up ? " " Sixteen hundred and thirty-nine , " Joe said , the sweat running off his fat face . " And you miss one ! You six , seven years old . How do you know things like that ? " " Mac ? " " No , " said Joe , shutting his eyes . " Do n't say it . It 's eary . " He banged a fist on the counter . " I 'm not going to wait on you any longer . I 'm going to your papa and make a clean breast of the whole thing . " " Maybe that 'd be a good thing , " I said . " That 's what Ance Thacker did . " " Who 's Ance Thacker ? " " A man stole one of Papa 's sheep . " " I want to get his advice . Where can find him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " where Papa had him sent . " Joe began to sweat real bad . It made the collar of his blue denim shirt all wet . " You go home ! " he said . He called after me . " And get that sickening sweet expression off your face ! " T HAT night Papa walked out on the porch and listened to the yells coming down across the meadow from Joe Garber 's stony hillside . Joe was plowing on the Balancing Rock hill by lantern light and yelling at his horse . " That Joe is certainly a case , " Papa said , shaking his head . Mama said , " It 's a worried man who plows by lantern light . " " He 'll never make it , " Papa said , " with that little store and that patch of hillside rocks and stumps his sister Esther left him . I 've offered him two thousand for the place just to get it for grazing . Why do n't he take it and go back to Baltimore ? " " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said , " Papa , how much does the old Balancing Rock weigh ? " " Many thousands of tons I suppose , " Papa said . I said , " How long has it been up there ? " " Probably several millions of years . " 1 said , " What keeps it up there ? " " What keeps it up there ! " Papa said . " Just the peculiar way it 's balanced , I suppose . It 's balanced very delicately . " I said , " I do n't guess it would take very much to make the old Balancing Rock tumble down out of Joe 's cornfield and come roaring down through the meadow and smash our house and barn and ? " " What ! " Papa said . " Now what in thunder made you think of a thing like that ? Beyond any conceivable doubt you can indulge in some of the most eccentric speculation of any gentleman in the whole range of my acquaintanceship . Will you kindly go to bed ? " " Joe 's plowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ? " " You go to bed ! " Papa said . I woke up ' way late and heard Joe still plowing ; he must have plowed all that night . II I NDIAN darts ! " Joe said to me . " A pocketful of Indian darts . No ! No positively ! " He called after me . " Wait ! I give you credit . You at least tried to be practical . I admire a boy who does anything practical . " He flung the trap door open and fished the box up by the cord . " How many does that make now ? " he asked . " A hundred and forty-six , " I said , " counting the one for Macintosh . " Joe yanked out the daybook and went bobbing over the figures . He slammed the book shut and looked at me . " I ca n't make you out , " he said . " This world was n't made for boys like you . Either that or it was n't made for men like me . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Some , " I said . " He 's startin ' to worry . " " Good ! " said Joe Garber . " You are a good boy . I am very fond of you . " " I 'm goin ' to do you a favor , " I said . " What kind of a favor ? " Joe asked me . " I 'm goin ' to tell Papa a story , " I said . " What kind of a story ? " Joe asked me , sweating some and sleepy from the night plowing . " I 'll say Joe Garber did n't butcher Macintosh 's little brother because I was out in the pasture and Mactntosh 's little brother said all of a sudden ' Look , I know how to fly ' and began to kick up all four heels and flap them like wings and all at once he flew over the top of Walker Mountain and went out of sight into a big gray cloud . That 's what really happened to MacIntosh 's ? " " No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go home ! Keep needling him from this big rock angle . " " Plow deeper , " I said . " Deeper ! " Joe said , sweating . " Kingdom come ! I met three Chinese coolies coming out of that hole already . " T ITAT night Papa walked out onto the porch and listened and shook his head . " A man could n't scratch an existence out of those stumps and rocks in the daytime even , " he said , " let alone at night . And he has n't the faintest idea about the principles of farming . I went up that way today and he 's just been plowing round and round that Balancing Rock . He 's batty . I wish he 'd get out of the country . I 've got half a notion to give him his price just to get rid of him . " " joe sounds like a man who 's trying to prove something , " Mama said . " Proving he 's an idiot for staying on here and asking four thousand for that place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , " I said , " and powerful close to the rock . Macintosh and I saw it kind of teeter today Iike it was going to come tumbling ? " " Confound it  --  hush ! " Papa said . He got up out of the swing and started pacing the porch , listening to Joe plowing round in a circle and yelling . " I must be upset over world conditions , " Papa said . " Ordinarily I would n't give this absurd thing a second 's thought . " He turned to me and said , " Go to bed ! You make me uneasy . " " Sometimes I think Joe is on the verge of proving something , " Mama said . " Right on the very verge . " J OE looked at the scratch on my arm . " I see , " he said , in a pretty good humor . " You caught an eagle and got it part way here , and then it scratched you and flew away ? That 's better than rotten eggs and Indian darts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . That 's improvement . That 's a step forward That 's what I like to see . You tried . How many is that now ? " " Two hundred and eight counting the one for Macintosh , " I said . Joe leaned his hairy arms on the counter and looked at me . " It 's a queer kind of a brain , " he said . " I ca n't figure you out . Put that kind of a brain onto something practical and you 'll outdo your papa . You 'll outdo everybody . He 's got me fenced in on three sides and forcing his own terms on me and you 'd fence everybody in . " " Much oblige , " I said . Joe looked at me queerly . " Sometimes when I look at you I get an awful feeling . Like you 're kind of a phenomenon nobody ever heard of before . What fool 's chimera ever made me leave Baltimore ? At heart I 'm a dreamer and philosopher . I used to sit in the cigar store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah ! The peace and quiet of a Virginia mountain valley . Beauty  --  history  --  tradition  --  babbling brooks  --  leaves in autumn  --  a place for a student of the race . ' And then I have to run into you and that cockeyed calf ? " " Plow deeper , " I said . " Deeper ! " Joe said . " Listen  --  I can see the moon below me now ! You go home . And do n't be sweet . " p APA paced up and down on the porch in the blue night air . " Such confounded yelling and tearing around and tormenting the earth I never heard ! " he said . He started off the porch . " Where are you going , Craig ? " Mama asked . " I 'm going up there and stop the fool , " Papa called back . " Ask him if he 's trying to prove some great scientific theory , " Mama called after him . Then , in a few minutes , from up on the hill , Mama and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa from away down in the trench where Joe was plowing . Papa yelled : " Stop it ! " and " Three thousand ! " and Joe yelled back : " No ! No positively ! Not a cent less than four ! " And they yelled back and forth that way until we heard Papa coming down across the meadow and slamming the yard gate as he only did when he was mad . And up on the hill Joe kept plowing and yelling but he was getting harder to hear because he was getting deeper all the time . Papa stomped up onto the porch and said , " I ca n't decide whether I actually saw that blasted rock teeter a little or whether it was just the light of thatpsychopathic 's lantern flickering on it . " " I do wish Joe would hurry up and prove whatever it is he 's trying to prove , " Mama said . Papa was too mad and upset to say anything more except for me to go to bed and I did and dreamed about strawberry pop all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter . " How did you get the six snake doctors ? " he asked . " Caught them , " I said . " And the trout ? ? " " Outran it , " I said . " Trouts  --  whippoorwills  --  ginseng , " Joe said , " Sometimes when I look at you I get an awful impression . Just awful ! Did you ever think about men and horses and machines and trucks and all such matter in a whole great big industry toiling just for you and Macintosh ? " " Unh-unh , " I said . " And chickens and quails and wild turkeys and geeses and birds and insects  --  all the things that fill earth and sky ? " " Much ? " " Do n't much oblige me . It 's an awful kind of feeling . How many does that make now ? " " Four hundred and twenty-eight , " I said , " counting ? " " I know  --  What kind of a brain have you got ? What are they learning you in school ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wonderful , " Joe said dreamily . " Sails in full furl and ports like Hong Kong . Singapore . Bagdad . Venice . The vast sea . Freedom . The open sky . Makes me sentimental and mellow inside . Ah ! The , oceans ! What do they make you think of ? " " Strawberry pop , " I said . Joe looked like he was saying his prayers . " They crossed you up , " he said . " They put salt in the oceans . " " That 's a dirty trick , " I said . " I 'd drink it anyway . " " Sometimes , " Joe said , " when I dare to go to sleep at all I get a hideous kind of nightmare . Your papa fencing me in . Seven oceans of strawberry pop on one side and you and Macintosh on the other and everything just pressing down ? " " Just keep on plowing , " I said . " He 's giving in ! ' " I hope so , " Joe said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Need more plow points ? " I asked . " No , " Joe said , " ? more earth . " T HuNDERATIoN ! " Papa said to me , striding up and down across the long porch in the blue night air . " Now what in blazes ever made you think of such a thing as that confounded rock rolling out of that hill . My common sense tells me nothing would ever budge it in a thousand years  --  but I ca n't get it off my mind . Hearing that idiot up there frenzying around makes me roll and toss when I go to bed . It 's worth more than a few dollars to me to get my sleep . " " He just might set up some kind of vibration , " Mama said . " Go to bed ! " Papa said to me . After I 'd gone to bed I could hardly hear Joe yelling at all . It was like he was yelling up from a deep mine . III H ummixo birds ! " Joe said to me next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one living has ever caught eighteen humming birds . It 's a phenomenon unknown to mankind . Take them to the door and let the harmless little things go before we have some great wrath poured on us from the sky . What kind of brain is that ? How do you do such things ? " " MacIntosh tells me how , " I said . Joe acted like he was mad . He had a gleam in his eye . " I 've played this little game with you long enough , my young buckaroo , " he said . He came around the counter . " You and I are going to have a showdown right this very minute . " He caught me by the seat of the pants and hustled me out of the store and across the footlog . " Now let 's hear your MacIntoshkabosh say something ! " I said , " MacIntosh , Joe do n't believe you tell me things . Tell him how you know Papa wo n't hold out much longer and will give Jae four thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strawberry pop we want every day for the rest of our lives . " Macintosh looked at Joe and then at me . He quit nibbling on the bunch of grass and was looking at us and behind us . " Hanh ! " said Joe . " While you 're at it  --  suppose you tell me how I ever let you two get into me for four hundred and thirty bottles of pop . Tell me a few little things like that ? " Macintosh did n't say anything and just kept on looking behind us and I did n't know what he was looking at and why he would n't talk until I felt the switch on my bare legs and then I knew it was because Papa was there behind me , and Macintosh never liked to talk before a crowd . Papa said , " Joe , come down to see me tomorrow and I 'll give you a check . " The next day Joe rode down to see Papa . He was smoking a cigar and he was in a fine humor . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and listened and all Papa said was , " I see  --  I see  --  I see " and while the words were the same they sounded different each time . Then they came out onto the porch and Joe was flourishing the check in his hand . " A true Chesterfield , " Joe said to Papa , " a gentleman of the old school . A veritable prince among his fellow men . " He walked across the porch and kissed me on each cheek and said , " And you . I can see you sailing through life on a blissful pink ocean . " Then Joe went out through the front gate and got on his horse and wheeled and turned in the saddle and gave us all a sharp salute and went riding up through the field singing , " There 's a Bright Golden Haze on the Meadow . " " They have strange people in Baltimore , " Mama said . " I never will believe but that he was just about to prove something . I 'd certainly give a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands together and looking at me and he said , " What you need is a little manual endeavor . Now let 's see  --  four hundred and thirty bottles of pop at five cents a bottle . I figure you owe me just about four hundred and thirty hours ' work at five cents an hour . " " Christmas ! " I said . " What doin ' ? " " Filling in that blasted hole that lunatic plowed up there , " Papa said . " Christmas ! " I said . " I 'll be an old man before I get that done . " " Well , " Papa said , " not being a mathematician , I could n't advise you how to get it done any sooner  --  suppose you ask Macintosh about that . " It 's . Nice gut It 's Not the Polka PHILIP GARRIGAN M Y EVGENIA goes to the Symphony And she sits there holding hands with me To hear Szigeti and Rubinstein And she says with her Russian eyes on mine " It 's nice  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ONE  --  TWO  --  THREE ; It stamps the feet , it shakes the knee , It rocks the building  --  and it rocks me When the band begins the polka ! I can not stand that heavy stuff By Brams and Batch and Prokofiuff ; I love the classics , but that 's enough ; It 's nice  --  but it 's not the polka ! " My Evgenia goes to the Polsky Dom Dancing till the cows come home . The waltz is schmaltz at the Dom Polsky Because she and the dancers all agree " It 's nice  --  but it 's not the polka ! " The polka goes like ONE  --  TWO  --  THREE And what can I say on my bended knee With Evgenia jumping and yelling wheeeee ! When the band begins the polka ? On account of the love which I am in I ask her if she likes Lohengrin And she replies with a Russian grin " It 's nice  --  but it 's not the polka ! " And it is  --  but it 's not the polka.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
