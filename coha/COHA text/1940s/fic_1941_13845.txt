A PORTION of Callaghan 's Restaurant-bar in New York . THOMAS PIPER , a waiter , is seated at a table reading a newspaper . He turns a page , notices the audience , goes on reading , remembers the audience , studies the audience , folds the paper , gets up , and moves forward . PIPER Ladies and gentlemen , before you is an illusion of a restaurant-bar in New York City : the bar , the bartender , a few tables and chairs , entrances , exits , Men 's Room , Ladies ' Room , kitchen , a cook and two Filipino boys in the kitchen , a hat-check girl out there near the door , a door-man on the sidewalk , a couple of cabs in the street , New York all around , the world everywhere else.Before I noticed you , I was seated there at the table , as you saw , reading the paper . I looked up a horse I bet on last night and discovered that it ran fifth . A horse named Tomorrow Morning , which of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's no matter . I read about a man who died , too . He was pretty well along in years . Seventy-one years old . He was a scientist of some kind . Left a large family . Never heard of him before . ( JOHN CALLAGHAN , the proprietor of the restaurant-bar , emerges from the Men 's Room ) You feel sorry for people who do n't stay alive to see what 's going to happen . How things are going to turn out . A lot of things are going on in the world . They 're all in the new style , too . Swifter. p. 3 JOHN CALLAGHAN What do you think you 're doing ? PIPER My boss , John Callaghan . He owns this place . Excuse me . ( To CALLAGHAN ) There was nothing to do . No business . I happened to notice the people . I was chatting with them . JOHN CALLAGHAN What people ? PIPER The people . Out there . JOHN CALLAGHAN ( Noticing the audience ) Now , go on , get about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe his eyes ) What happened ? PIPER I do n't know , but there they are . I did n't want to be rude . Under the circumstances they do n't talk , you see , so naturally we 've got to . I was telling them I noticed where a man died . I was saying I feel sorry for people who do n't stay alive so they can find out what happens . ( CALLAGHAN is nervous and embarrassed . He whispers in PIPER 'S ear ) No , no . Just act natural . You 've seen people before , and they 've seen you . Now do n't be shy . Just go about your business as if nobody were looking . I 'll talk to the folks until we get a customer . How do we know somebody interesting is n't going to come in here and order the dollar dinner ? Do you want to say a few words ? Introduce yourself or something like that ? ( CALLAGHAN whispers ) Oh , sure . I think that would be very nice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confusion ) Ladies and gentlemen ! Welcome to Callaghan 's ! ( Pause , confusion ) PIPER Go ahead , do n't be afraid . JOHN CALLAGHAN Ladies and gentlemen ! PIPER That 's it . Loud and clear , and political . Give it flowers . JOHN CALLAGHAN ( Softly ) Welcome to Callaghan 's . PIPER They 're here . They 've got nowhere to go , or they would n't be here . ( CALLAGHAN whispers again ) Now you 're talking . ( To the audience ) Since Mr. Callaghan ca n't talk , he wants to dance . ( CALLAGHAN goes ) While he 's getting his derby , I 'll say a few words about him . Ladies and gentlemen , the proprietor of this establishment , by name John Callaghan , is sixty-two years old . Not so very long ago Mr. Callaghan operated a speakeasy . He is the father of two sons , one a lawyer and the other a doctor , both married , both fathers ; and two daughters , both married , and both mothers . ( CALLAGHAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Callaghan is now going to dance . p. 5 JOHN CALLAGHAN ( Whispering ) O.K. , Tom ? PIPER I 'll count three , and then break right into it . Ready ? One . Two . Three . ( CALLAGHAN lifts one leg and stops ) All right . Again . One . Two . Three . JOHN CALLAGHAN I ca n't move . PIPER Take it easy , boss . You want to dance ? All right . I 'll dance first . ( He starts to dance ) You see ? Nothing to it . ( He stops ) Are you ready now ? O.K. One . Two . Three . ( CALLAGHAN ca n't dance . PIPER refuses to help him any more . CALLAGHAN in desperation begins to sing The Harp That Once Through Tara 's Halls . He does a very heroic job . PIPER applauds ) JOHN CALLAGHAN I thank you . ( He bows . PIPER applauds some more ; he bows ; more applause ; he bows ; PIPER stops applauding ) PIPER O.K. , boss . Now , let me get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift-moving young man of twenty-seven or so , comes in , followed by HELEN , the hat-check girl ) HELEN Your hat and coat , sir . p. 6 HARRY I 'll put them on a chair . Here 's a dime . No , wait , that was a quarter . That 's all right . Keep it . HELEN Thank you , sir . ( She goes ) HARRY ( To PIPER ) Get me a glass of water , will you please ? PIPER Yes , sir . HARRY What 's on the dinner ? O.K. , medium rare . ( To CALLAGHAN , who has been watching , with his mouth open ) Have you looked at this afternoon 's paper yet ? ( He sits down , gets up ) The whole place is on fire . Get me something to drink . A pleasant wine of some kind . To hell with it . Get me a Scotch . Have you read the paper ? ( He sits down . PIPER returns with a glass of water which HARRY takes and gulps desperately , spilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . PIPER opens a bill of fare and offers it to HARRY ) I 've ordered . PIPER The New York cut , sir ? HARRY That 's fine . You got the time ? Ten-thirty , is that right ? PIPER Ten thirty-five . HARRY Thanks . Never carry a watch . Do n't need to . Bores me . Always know what time it is anyway . Got more time than I can use . Who am I to know the time right down to the last minute ? Now , if you 'll excuse me , I want to finish this paper . Workers are the luckiest people in the world . Got their time regulated for them . Safest way to live . The only way . I 'd be a waiter myself if I could do it . You belong to the union , I suppose . Make a fair living . Nice atmosphere . ( Suddenly shouting ) Where the hell is that drink ? p. 7 PIPER Right here on the table , sir . HARRY Who put that there ? ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that ? O.K. , let me have another . PIPER Yes , sir . Anything else , sir ? HARRY Yes . Thanks for reminding me . ( Gives PIPER a nickel ) Get me Rhinelander 2-8182 . ( Suddenly notices the audience ) Who are those people ? PIPER New Yorkers , for the most part . A few out-of-towners . HARRY Rhinelander 2-8182 . What are they doing out there ? PIPER Watching us . HARRY People stink . I avoid them . O.K. , get that number . Any music in this place ? PIPER Only the nickel phonograph . HARRY Well , do n't let anybody put a nickel in it . ( CALLAGHAN leads a beautiful young woman into the dining-room . PEGGY . HARRY stands ) Cancel that call . ( The young woman sits down ) Ask the young lady what she 'll have . p. 8 PEGGY Nothing , thank you . ( PIPER goes ) HARRY Have you looked at this afternoon 's paper yet ? PEGGY Yes , I have . HARRY ( To PIPER ) Is that girl a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pardon , sir ? HARRY I never saw anybody take up with a stranger so swiftly . It 's O.K. As a matter of fact , I 'm fond of people who are professional in all things . PIPER ( Bringing another drink ) Yes , sir . HARRY I 'm an amateur myself , always have been , always will be . Do n't know the first thing about anything . Do n't want to learn . ( Sips ) Despise everybody . ( To PEGGY ) Do you live in New York ? ( PIPER takes away one glass , puts down another ) Rhinelander 2-8182 . PIPER Shall I ask for someone in particular ? HARRY Just say Harry Mallory 's calling and ask her to hold the line . PIPER Harry Mallory . Yes , sir . ( PIPER goes . HARRY returns to the paper . A dignified gentleman of sixty or so , accompanied by a beautiful young woman , comes in . R. J. PINKERTON . LOIS ) p. 9 HARRY Good evening . LOIS Is he talking to you ? PINKERTON I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . You promised we would n't . PINKERTON Nobody comes here , and the food 's very good . HARRY How are things down on Wall Street ? PINKERTON ( Irritated ) I beg your pardon , have you been speaking to me ? HARRY Unless it 's to the girl . I do n't know her . PINKERTON ( Angry ) Are you under the impression that you know me ? HARRY ( Slowly ) There 's a war in the world . You 'll be dead in ten years . Sit down and go on with whatever it is you 're going on with . ( To PIPER , returning ) Did you get that number ? PIPER There 's no answer , sir . LOIS ( To CALLAGHAN ) What kind of a place is this , anyway ? ( She suddenly notices the audience and gasps ) Hurry . Let 's get out of here . p. 10 HARRY Sit down and eat your supper . PINKERTON ( Noticing the audience , to CALLAGHAN ) I had no idea . JOHN CALLAGHAN I 'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( To LOIS ) Do you want to go ? LOIS What 's the use going now ? HARRY Have you looked at this afternoon 's paper yet ? PINKERTON ( To CALLAGHAN ) I would rather not shout across the dining-room . JOHN CALLAGHAN ( To HARRY ) Excuse me , sir . We 've all been young and troubled . HARRY Who 's young and troubled ? JOHN CALLAGHAN The gentleman would rather not shout with you . HARRY Who ? JOHN CALLAGHAN The elderly gentleman with the young woman . HARRY Oh . Well , that 's all right . Young and troubled ? I suppose you think I 'm a little crazy , too . JOHN CALLAGHAN No . I do n't believe I do . p. 11 HARRY Well , as a matter of fact I am , but so are you . And so is he , too . Some people have sensibility and some have n't . Some have a little and some have a lot . I have a lot . If it were money I 'd be a millionaire . ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PINKERTON ( With anger and great aloofness ) What things ? LOIS Do n't answer him . He 's drunk . HARRY Drunk ? I 'll drink everybody in this place under the table and still be more sober than a man about to be electrocuted for a crime he did n't commit . ( To CALLAGHAN ) What do you want to run a restaurant for ? People are no good . What do you want to feed them for ? PIPER Your steak , sir . HARRY Is it medium rare ? PIPER Yes , sir . HARRY O.K. Try that number again . I 'd be a waiter myself if I could do it . ( Going to PEGGY ) Do n't you see they keep doing things over and over again without thinking , and without ever doing anything right . Naturally they never catch up with what 's right . What are you doing , eating alone ? ( Shouting suddenly ) Somebody put a nickel in that phonograph , will you ? p. 12 PEGGY I wanted to be alone for a change . HARRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as if to dance ) I hope you do n't mind . I 'd like to be unalone for a change . I have not yet met an honest man . I 've found men honest for a moment , but only for a moment . I myself have been dishonest , and am still . How is anything good ever going to come about if a man who wants to be honest , ca n't ? I do n't mean small honesty , the kind that goes in ledgers , the honesty of poor intimidated workers who ought to be dishonest . I mean broad generous reckless deep honesty . There 's no one to talk to , and it gets very lonely . PEGGY I think I know what you mean . HARRY ( Pause , slowly ) Thanks for the dance . ( They have not danced . He seats her ) How is it that you are able not to talk ? PEGGY There 's so little to say . HARRY ( Amazed , slowly ) Oh . ( He just misses his chair and sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ) Where 's my coffee ? ( He remains on the floor , looking at the paper . PIPER arrives ) Did you get the number ? p. 13 PIPER Yes , sir . HARRY Tell her to get in a cab and come right down . PIPER Yes , sir . ( He turns to the audience ) What 'd I tell you ? ( The stage lights go down . THOMAS PIPER , the waiter , comes out from the wings , and stands in a spot of light ) PIPER You will forgive me , I hope , for coming out here for a moment before we go back into the restaurant.As I began to say before the good customer arrived , you feel sorry for people who do n't stay alive , since they can never again find out what happens.But a lot of people who stay alive never find out what happens . They never find out what happens even to themselves . Some of them have good educations , too.Already some of you may be asking yourselves , for instance , what 's this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm glad you came tonight instead of last night because what happened last night would n't make anybody ask , What 's this stuff mean ? A few people came and ate and paid their checks and went . Before you arrived tonight , it was the same here as last night . Around five o'clock a few people came for drinks . A young fellow I know who writes for The New Yorker flirted with a young woman who turned out to be from his home town , Pasadena , California , and they went to the theater together . Around six a few people came for dinner . By half-past nine the place was empty.I would have tried to entertain you tonight myself , but I 'm glad the people came , especially the young fellow . Once we get back into the restaurant , chances are I wo n't have time to do anything except wait table . That 's why I 've come out here now.Even though I 'm a waiter by profession , I find casual talk easy and effortless for me , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consequently , in the absence of someone more suited to the work  --  which is a pleasure  --  I shall try to keep direct contact with you.Callaghan 's is n't exactly Jack &amp; Charlie 's or The Stork Club , so naturally when unusual people come here I feel grateful and a little happier about my humble position in the American social world . Most of you have been to Jack &amp; Charlie 's or The Stork Club anyway , and I dare say a good many of you have sat at tables near the people you read about every day in Walter Winchell 's column , or the column in The Post by Leonard Lyons , or in the news sections when they get married or divorced . I myself , I suppose , have waited on everybody who goes to Jack &amp; Charlie 's at one time or another , and on the whole they 're no different from anybody else . On the other hand , some of the people who come here sometimes are , in my opinion , characters out of fiction.There was a man came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about in newspapers , personal life unrevealed , about a hundred and thirty pounds in weight , a little bald , ate four thick steaks one after another and wanted to box Callaghan and me put together . Was n't drunk , had no hard feelings , only wanted to box . Sang three songs , paid his check , and we never saw him again . He might have been the vice-president of a bank somewhere . Mild , courteous , worried-looking.What I mean is , a restaurant may very often be the scene of great anonymous events . Especially a restaurant in New York , the biggest city in the world . A place where people eat and drink is more likely to witness the emergence of the flamboyant from ordinary human beings than a place where people do not eat and drink . But not necessarily the flamboyant alone . Such a place might witness the arrival in human lives of nobility of one sort or another , or a delicate synchronization of wisdom and mischief , or even a delightful balance of irrelevant truth and irrelevant error.It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about such language as the language I have been throwing about , and to others of you it may seem , in our time , perfectly natural . There are no doubt waiters at Jack &amp; Charlie 's who , owing to the people they serve , are capable of wit far surpassing anything I shall ever be likely to amaze myself with.Henry , for instance , whom many of you know . I have heard that some of the finest minds of this country have asked questions of Henry , and I do n't mean questions concerning food or drink . I mean questions of some esthetic significance . And well they might , from what I hear of the intelligence operating in Henry.As for myself , away from the more heightened atmospheres of gracious living , such as Jack &amp; Charlie 's , I believe I can explain my occasional use of the expressive word and phrase by revealing that , for many years , I have read The New York Times . As well as magazines and books published in this country , in the English language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , News-week , The New Republic , The Nation , The New Masses occasionally , The Racing Form every day , and a wide variety of contemporary writers , including , at random , George Santayana , John Dewey , and , I say this with no embarrassment , William Shakespeare . I listen to the radio : symphonies , and other programs , especially broadcasts from Europe . With all that is happening in the world , including what I myself witness here at Callaghan 's , I am sure you understand a little better why I feel unhappy about the people who die every day , who shall not continue to witness the further unfolding of whatever drama this is that is taking place . You may also understand a little better what goes on here tonight , which is , at best , I might say , not altogether unrelated to what goes on everywhere else every day.I 'm delighted you 've come , and hope you will forgive me for having taken advantage of this opportunity to say these things . p. 14 HARRY 'S VOICE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must go now , but I 'll be seeing you again as soon as possible . ( The stage lights go up ) PIPER Yes , sir . HARRY Here . Read this pamphlet sometime . It was given to me by an elderly lady in Central Park . PIPER Thank you , sir . I shall read it at the very first opportunity . HARRY I 've been carrying that pamphlet around for over three years . I remember the old lady very clearly : she was angelic and unbalanced . About sixty-seven years old . Smiling , brittle and efficient . I watched her hand out eleven of the pamphlets . No one refused . No one dared . ( Pause ) Have you had your supper ? All right , sit down and I will bring you your supper . No . Please . I insist . You must not deprive me of the privilege . PIPER Thank you , sir , but I ca n't . HARRY Why not ? PIPER It 's against the rules . HARRY ( Angry ) Rules ? ( Pause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules . None whatsoever . Honor , none . Grace , none . Truth , none . Therefore , rules , none . Where in this configuration of error and crime which is called contemporary history , may we find one rule in operation ? ( Pause ) Nowhere . ( Taking off his coat ) Let no foolish rule , therefore , operate here , in this sudden accidental moment of religion . Let no bluff of map or chart , measure or theory , impurify my compulsion to exchange places with you . My coat . Kindly give me yours . ( He hands PIPER his coat . PIPER gives HARRY his coat . CALLAGHAN comes over . To CALLAGHAN ) He is to dine and I am to wait upon him . p. 15 JOHN CALLAGHAN Please . PIPER Yes , sir , please . HARRY I insist . This is , thank God , still America . I am still a free man . Sit down . ( PIPER sits down , wearing HARRY 'S coat . HARRY hands him a bill of fare ) Your pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't order , Tom . It 's a violation of union rules . We 'll be picketed in ten minutes . You know who the hat-check girl is going around with . HARRY ( Defiantly ) Who ? JOHN CALLAGHAN Sammy , that 's who . The biggest organizer in the Waiters ' Union . HARRY You have swords ? JOHN CALLAGHAN No , sir . HARRY Pistols ? JOHN CALLAGHAN No , sir . HARRY Banana knives ? JOHN CALLAGHAN No , sir . HARRY Then he and I shall duel with salad forks . ( To PIPER ) I repeat : Your pleasure , sir . PIPER ( To CALLAGHAN ) Maybe Helen wo n't notice . p. 16 HELEN Wo n't notice ? I shall telephone Sammy immediately . JOHN CALLAGHAN Helen , please do n't . He 's not really waiting table . The man 's a Democrat , do n't you see ? Why bother Sammy ? This man 's not a professional waiter . HELEN He 's wearing a waiter 's jacket , and he 's waiting table . HARRY ( Proudly ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PIPER All right . To hell with it . I 'll start with a chilled Dubonnet cocktail . HARRY Dubonnet cocktail . PIPER Blue point oysters on the half shell . HARRY They 're very good , sir . PIPER ( Shouting ) Where 's my drink ? ( To PEGGY ) I beg your pardon . PEGGY Oh , that 's all right . PIPER Onion soup , la carte . HARRY Onion soup , la carte . Your drink , sir . PIPER ( Sipping ) I suppose , at work like this , one can not help meeting occasionally , interesting , or at least fairly interesting , people . p. 17 HARRY Yes , sir . PIPER ( To PINKERTON ) Hath made battleships ? PINKERTON ( To CALLAGHAN ) That 's your waiter , is n't it ? JOHN CALLAGHAN It is , and by God I wash my hands of the whole thing . PIPER ( To LOIS ) Art negotiating ? LOIS Art nothing , and mind your own business . HELEN Sammy 's coming right down . He 's bringing six picketers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammy and to hell with the picketers , too . ( He sings The Harp etc. again , while HARRY waits on PIPER . After the song HARRY applauds ) HARRY ( To PIPER ) The two Filipinos in the kitchen are shooting craps . PIPER Instruct the little brown brothers to cease . If they invite you to enter the contest , refuse . If possible , confiscate the dice . HARRY Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . Did you enjoy the cocktail ? PIPER Never ask questions . Do you want to be a waiter , or a nuisance ? p. 18 HARRY A waiter , sir . Thank you . I meant no offense . PIPER And never apologize . To anybody . Nothing is more offensive to those who enjoy an advantage than to be apologized to by those who enjoy a disadvantage . Having become humble , do you wish to become superior , too ? Or are you already weary of the exchange ? HARRY Weary ? Oh , no , sir . PIPER Very well , then . Get me another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PIPER opens the little pamphlet and studies it ) PIPER ( To PEGGY ) Can you guess what the message here might be ? PEGGY Only vaguely . HARRY I ca n't , even vaguely . Therefore , I shall turn the page and read . ( To PINKERTON ) Hear this . ( To LOIS ) You , too . LOIS He 's a waiter . How dare he talk to me ? PINKERTON ( Angry and loud ) Mr. Callaghan ! ( PABLO , one of the Filipino boys , appears , holding a head of lettuce and a knife ) p. 19 JOHN CALLAGHAN ( Humbly ) Mr. Pinkerton . PINKERTON Your waiter must be asked to stop this foolishness , this mockery  --  ( He stands eloquently ) This fantastic disregard of moral order . PABLO ( Going to PINKERTON ) Shut up . PINKERTON I beg your pardon ? PABLO Sit down . What do you know about the Philippine Islands ? PINKERTON Not very much , I 'm afraid . PABLO ( Standing over PINKERTON ) Have you studied the situation , imports and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture , mining and manufacture of the Philippine Islands ? PINKERTON No , I have n't . PABLO Have you had the honor of an audience with the President of the Philippine Islands ? PINKERTON No , I have n't . PABLO Do you know the problems of the people of the Philippine Islands ? PINKERTON Not insofar as they differ from the problems of people everywhere else . p. 20 PABLO Is the situation of the Filipino boy in America something you have put on the scale of justice ? PINKERTON I 'm afraid not . PABLO Do you know the cultural , racial , and religious background of the Filipino people ? PINKERTON Yes . That is a field I have investigated . PABLO Shut up . You know nothing . You do not know anything . JOHN CALLAGHAN Pablo , what 's all this talk ? PABLO Mr. Callaghan , in spite of the fact that my position is a lowly one , I have no protest to make . I am satisfied with the salary . I prefer the hours , which leave me time during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , and it is a pleasure to work with him . It is also a pleasure to help you maintain the excellent service for which Callaghan 's is famous . However , the situation of the Filipino boy in America is such that , in the presence of speech-making which misrepresents the truth , the Filipino boy who has been educated in the American schools of Manila is not so stupid as to allow such misrepresentation to go unchallenged . ( PANCHO appears ) JOHN CALLAGHAN All right , but put away that knife , at least . p. 21 PABLO The knife is for the lettuce . I am making a salad for Pancho and myself . ( To PINKERTON ) Have you had the honor of an audience with the President of the Philippine Islands ? PANCHO ( In Filipino ) Pablo , what are you doing out here in the dining-room ? Get the hell back into the kitchen where you belong . PABLO ( In Filipino ) This man has been making false remarks about the Philippine Islands . ( To PINKERTON ) Excuse me just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is an ignorant man , but very rich . PANCHO ( In Filipino ) Who 's the woman with him ? PABLO Some chicken he picked up somewhere . PANCHO Not bad , is she ? PABLO She 's sitting down . What would she be standing up ? PANCHO Very nice , I believe . PABLO You are probably mistaken . PANCHO No , I believe she 's got quite a carriage . PABLO In my opinion I believe it is not possible to know unless she stands . p. 22 PANCHO ( In English , to LOIS ) Excuse me . Would you be good enough to stand ? ( LOIS looks around , terrified , but stands . In Filipino ) You see ? PABLO No , I do n't . ( To LOIS , in English ) Would you please step away from the table ? ( LOIS does so ) Thank you . ( In Filipino , his eyes brightening ) You are right , for once in your life . How would you like to engage that in a little nighttime contest ? PANCHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatically , to PINKERTON ) The situation of the Filipino boy in America . ( To PANCHO , in Filipino , with anger ) I 'll take care of this . ( To PINKERTON ) In Manila the boys go to American schools . They learn to speak correct English . They read good books . They see American moving pictures . They come to America . LOIS May I sit down ? PANCHO They apply for a position in a bank . PABLO Just a moment , Pancho . ( To LOIS ) Please sit down . It is not your fault . Our quarrel is not with you . ( To PINKERTON ) In Manila there are Clubs , progressive and patriotic . p. 23 PANCHO They apply for a position in the capitol of the United States : Washington , D. C. PABLO Just a moment , Pancho . PANCHO They apply for a position in the moving-pictures . PABLO ( In Filipino ) Do n't lose the thread of the thought .

I hear you and Pablo have been shooting craps . PANCHO ( Sitting down ) Pablo is not a good gambler . PABLO One minute please . PIPER Quiet , everybody . PABLO ( To PIPER ) Have you studied the situation in the Philippine Islands ? p. 24 PIPER All right , Pablo . Sit down . ( PABLO sits down ) PABLO ( To PINKERTON ) In the future , before you talk , investigate your subject . Go ahead , Tom . PIPER Listen . All of you .

PABLO ( Lifting his head , but not the rest of his body ) I spoke to the young lady , not to you . ( To LOIS ) May I have the honor ? I am waiting . LOIS Thank you so much . I 'm really too tired . Really . ( PABLO comes up briskly ) p. 25 PABLO ( Bowing to PINKERTON ) May I have the honor ? ( PINKERTON leaps to his feet , outraged ) PANCHO ( To PEGGY ) In Honolulu , hula-hula . ( HARRY looks around . He takes off PIPER 'S coat ) HARRY My coat , please . PIPER Yes , sir . HARRY ( Getting into his coat , while PIPER gets into his ) One thing is obvious . The insanity of the world , or the art of the world , the grace thereof , or the foolishness thereof , must touch all who live therein , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammy . ( SAMMY comes in briskly , a small , energetic fellow ) SAMMY Stop in the name of Local 1 ! HARRY Take it easy . This is not local . Have a drink . ( To JIM , the bartender ) Give him a drink . JIM Yes , sir . HARRY ( Looking around ) The world , we know , is amok . The realm of all reality , therefore , is now also amok . The world has always been uninhabitable , but every man alive has been himself a place of refuge from the world  --  from its murder , its spiritual pestilence , its adultery , its false-witness , its contempt , its treachery , its perjury , its whoring , its mean streets , its rotting cities , its diseased governments : all the things which engage in contest with the free spirit of a man . The world has always been unworthy of that free spirit , but now also the body of each man in the world has lost its base , its location , its position , its security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its power , its youth and form , its blood and ensemble , its beginning and continuity : the things which combine miraculously to make of it a refuge . And now , therefore , like the world , the body of every man is uninhabitable . Life is on fire ; caught in hurricanes ; submerged in deep and blind waters ; bitten by insects ; eaten by microbes ; broken by shell-fire ; driven mad by machines ; pushed down by heavy things on wheels ; spit upon by the radio ; and confounded by all the other absurd things that happen every day . ( He pauses , looking around ) Unless next you want to murder one another , for whatever humor there may be in it , each of you go back to his place and person , and another drink for me . ( He watches everybody straighten out . He sits down and picks up the paper again ) This may be the last day of reality . We had better try to be human while there is time . ( Excited voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looks toward the entrance ) p. 26 PEGGY What is it ? LOIS I wish I knew what 's going on . PINKERTON Something new has happened in Europe , that 's all . ( CLAY , the enormous Negro doorman , in uniform , comes running in ) PEGGY , LOIS , PINKERTON AND CALLAGHAN What 's the matter ? HARRY Who 's being murdered ? CLAY On the contrary . A cab just came up with a lady . She 's having a baby . It 's too late to take her to a hospital . ( Excitement and talk : A baby ? Here ? This is a restaurant . Bring her in . Do n't bring her in . Who is she ? What are we going to do ? ) Anybody around here know anything about having a baby ? ( He turns and runs ) HARRY This is no year in which to be born , and no world to be born into . ( Voices from the street . PABLO and PANCHO come out of the kitchen ) PABLO What 's the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PABLO A baby ? ( To LOIS ) Go in the kitchen and get some hot water . ( LOIS goes , followed by PABLO ) p. 27 PANCHO ( To PEGGY ) You , too . ( PEGGY goes , followed by PANCHO ) ( CLAY returns with the young woman on his arm . Supporting her also is a small taxi-driver named FRITZ ) FRITZ A Scotch and soda , please ! ( Everybody stands around nervously , confused and helpless ) CLAY ( To the young woman ) Hold on , lady . Hold on . ( HARRY gets up and is walking to the young woman as the stage lights go down ) ( Again THOMAS PIPER , the waiter , comes forward and stands in a spot of light ) PIPER The time required for the making of one human life is , for all I know , probably closer to nine thousand years than to nine months . In view of the incredible amount of time and effort involved , and the astonishing ineffectuality of that which comes into being , the transaction must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inasmuch as only a few minutes ago , by the grace of God , another nine thousand years achieved its wholeness in the arrival here of one more human being . The infant , I am pleased to report , is all right , and so is the mother . A little over seven pounds in weight , the new inhabitant of the world has been named Callaghan , after Mr. John Callaghan , whose son Dr. Neal Callaghan reached the mother four minutes after the birth had taken place . Mother and son have been transferred to a nearby hospital.For the record , I think you might like to know who helped most to make the birth a success . It was Pablo . I myself , ordinarily not very much amazed by anything , was very much amazed at the superior poise and control with which Pablo met the emergency , while almost everybody else stood around paralyzed and eager to take orders from him . No doubt a savage at heart , the situation , although unfamiliar , was one he could cope with instinctively , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor , perfect English , and not the slightest abandonment of his own ego.Nine thousand years : one human being . Anonymous at birth , nobody knows who he 's liable to turn out to be . He is the most imaginative of all creations , and yet what happens , as his own years come to him , is usually ordinary , dull , and for the most part boring . We can predict for the man just born anything we like , but the truth is he is not very likely to grow into anything extraordinary . His father , at the age of twenty-seven or so , is in many ways special , in many things admirable , but on the whole nothing more than a good-natured , loud-voiced , intelligent , angry , sensible , absurd , and heroic young man . Callaghan Mallory , the new arrival , is breathing , and here to stay . If we are honest , we must admit with regret that he is here to no avail  --  other than perhaps that ultimately he shall enjoy good company , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this sort which are , in one degree or another , the compensations for all who have been swindled , and are breathing in the world.Critics of art , of music , of cooking , of manners , and of all other things , are men and women who want to know what goes on , why , and what it means . As I myself am a critic of all things , from the behavior of the common fly to the shape of the great fable , so , too , is each of you such a critic . Now , more than ever , you are wondering , What is this about ? I do n't blame you . Finding little or no meaning in the world , you insist upon unmistakable meaning in created things , in things of illusion of which this is , good or bad , an example . Is anything here intended to be taken seriously ? Are you expected to understand any of this ? The answer is , courteously , No more than you would be apt to understand anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor you are the same as we were when we met an hour ago . One hour from now we shall be a little different from what we are now . I am , here , the illusion of an American waiter in New York . You are , each of you , the illusion of the person who owns your name , your past , your years , your belongings , and so forth and so on . Each of us was once placed at the center of the universe as Callaghan Mallory has just been placed . Each of us has been , once , in his own person  --  small and helpless and charged with an infinite variety of compulsions  --  the substance , but not the explanation , of the great mystery of mortality . It appears to be our destiny that as long as we live we shall be only the substance of that mystery , and that as soon as we die there is no telling . In the meantime we are allowed to endure the interlude as pleasantly as we are able to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Here , in this restaurant , is the illusion of our reality  --  ( The stage lights rise )  --  which we shall proceed to explore , while there is still time , and no deaths among you . ( The place is empty except for FRITZ , the taxi-driver , and JIM , the bartender . They are drunk , but they are still drinking . They speak softly , almost whispering ) p. 28 FRITZ Do you want to know why ? JIM I want to know why she came here in a cab . FRITZ Because I brought her here in a cab , that 's why . JIM Why did you bring her ? FRITZ Because she was going to have a baby , that 's why . You want to know why ? JIM Why ? FRITZ Because you 've got to have a lot of babies . JIM Why ? FRITZ To keep the cabs going , that 's why . JIM Why ? FRITZ So the cab-drivers can keep going . ( Pause ) JIM Oh . FRITZ I want to shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman . ( They shake hands ) You want to know why ? JIM Why ? FRITZ Because you want to keep the cab-drivers going , too , that 's why . You want to know why ? p. 29 JIM Why ? FRITZ Because I want to keep the bartenders going . JIM Oh . I want to shake your hand . ( They shake hands ) Because you 're a gentleman , too . You want to know why ? FRITZ Why ? JIM Because you do n't ask questions the way some people do . FRITZ What questions ? JIM The kind of questions people are always coming into a place and asking a bartender all the time . Why this and why that and why this and why that . FRITZ I want to shake your hand again . Do you want to know why ? JIM Why ? FRITZ Because you 're intelligent . Do you want to know what that means ? JIM Yeah . What does it mean ? ( FRITZ looks around , as if he were about to utter a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the stool ) FRITZ Just a minute . JIM What 's the matter ? FRITZ Somebody 's listening . Somebody 's been eavesdropping . p. 30 JIM Who ? FRITZ ( Indicating audience ) The people . JIM Oh . FRITZ Have I said anything I 'll regret ? JIM What 's it mean to be intelligent ? FRITZ Nothing . Just forget I brought it up . Do you think I want to lose my chauffeur 's license ? I 've been drinking a little , that 's all . Give me one more drink . ( A young man comes in ) CALLAGHAN MALLORY Give me one , too . JIM Scotch ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY O.K. ( JIM places a drink each on the bar , and makes one for himself ) Your health , gentlemen . FRITZ AND JIM Yours , too . ( They drink ) CALLAGHAN MALLORY Have you seen tomorrow 's paper yet ? JIM No , I have n't . FRITZ Well , I guess I 'll get back to work . CALLAGHAN MALLORY It 's too late now . FRITZ What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow 's paper yet ? FRITZ No . Why ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY Well , if you had seen tomorrow 's paper , you 'd know . FRITZ Know what ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY That it 's too late to get back to work . FRITZ Why ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY Because of the news in tomorrow 's paper . FRITZ What news ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY That for over one thousand nine hundred and forty-one years the world has been inhabited by the dead , not the living . FRITZ You mean we 're dead ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY According to tomorrow 's paper . FRITZ You mean you and me and the bartender ? We 're all dead ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY I believe that 's the message in tomorrow 's paper . FRITZ You mean the lady who had the baby ? And the baby ? And everybody in the world ? And everybody who ever lived in the world since one thousand nine hundred and forty-one years ago ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY That is the impression tomorrow 's paper seems to give . p. 32 FRITZ What edition ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY The edition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bartender ) Run out and get a later edition , will you , Jim ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY There are n't any later editions . FRITZ ( To JIM ) Well , run out into the street and ask somebody . CALLAGHAN MALLORY There 's no street out there , and no people , either . FRITZ What do you mean ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY I mean the illusion broke at midnight tonight . FRITZ What illusion ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY The illusion of reality . Consequently , ever since midnight the dead have been truly the dead , and the unreal has been truly the unreal . There is nothing any more anywhere . FRITZ On the level ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY It 's in tomorrow 's paper and it appears to be on the level . FRITZ In that case , Jim , give me another drink . JIM In that case , I think I 'd better have another myself . How about you ? p. 33 CALLAGHAN MALLORY Thank you . FRITZ ( Looking around ) Well , what do you know ? This is a surprise . I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad I know . I do n't have to get back to work any more , is that it ? I 'm through , hey ? ( THE YOUNG MAN nods ) Well , that 's fine . Give me another drink , Jim . JIM ( Getting three drinks ) Well , this beats everything . FRITZ ( To THE YOUNG MAN ) What about those people out there ? ( He indicates the audience ) CALLAGHAN MALLORY What about them ? FRITZ Dead or alive ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY Officially ? Dead . They 'll last as long as we last . FRITZ How long is that going to be ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY Not very long . FRITZ Well , give me another drink , then . No more living . That 's all right . No more world . Are you sure ? What about this money in my pocket ? This seven dollars and forty-seven cents ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY You can give it to charity for all it 's worth . p. 34 FRITZ How much more time we got ? An hour ? Ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or what ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY Oh , no . Infinities , if we have any time at all . FRITZ Wait a minute . Wait a minute . There 's a catch here somewhere . What do you mean , infinities ? How much more time we got before we 're dead ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY All the time in the world . We 're dead now . FRITZ Jim , just for the devil of it , run out into the street and take a look at things . JIM ( Going ) Sure . FRITZ Fond of drinking ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY Extremely . FRITZ Loaded to the gills , at the moment ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY At the moment , no . Sober as a judge . FRITZ Sober as a judge . Everybody dead . No world . Well , that 's all right . ( Louder ) How about it , Jim ? JIM ( Returning ) He 's right all right . FRITZ What do you mean ? p. 35 JIM There 's no street out there and nothing else , either . FRITZ You know what street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know it used to be 52nd Street , East . FRITZ What is it now ? JIM On my word of honor , nothing . FRITZ Is n't my cab out there in front of the place ? JIM No street , no cab , nothing . FRITZ Give me another drink . ( To THE YOUNG MAN ) No more illusion and stuff ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY No more . FRITZ Nothing 's going to happen any more ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY The same things are going to be repeated , and I might say they 're going to be repeated more or less endlessly , but outside of that everything is ended . JIM Why ? FRITZ Why ? What do you mean why , Jim ? JIM Why is everything ended ? What happened to 52nd Street , East ? FRITZ Explain that to the bartender. p. 36 CALLAGHAN MALLORY The illusion broke at midnight . It was an accident , most likely . FRITZ ( To JIM ) Does that explain it ? ( Suddenly ) Where 's my cab ? You 're drunk , that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run out . JIM What glue ? FRITZ Yeah , what glue ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY The glue that held the illusion together . FRITZ Well , give me another drink anyway . You may be right , you may be wrong . For all I care , you may be sober , you may be drunk . Whether I 'm alive or whether I 'm dead , all I want is a drink . If it 's ended or if it 's just begun , a Scotch and soda , please . Illusion or reality , no illusion or no reality , one drink more before I go . JIM My own words . ( Drinks all around ) My very own sentiments . ( To THE YOUNG MAN ) You a native of California ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY No . New York . JIM My name 's Jim . ( He offers his hand ) I 'm pleased to meet you . p. 37 FRITZ My name 's Fritz . ( They shake hands ) I 'm pleased to meet you , too . CALLAGHAN MALLORY It 's a pleasure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRITZ Callaghan . Is n't that the name they gave the baby that was born here tonight ? JIM That 's right . Callaghan . Callaghan  --  what was that young fellow 's last name ? Harry  --  CALLAGHAN MALLORY Mallory ? JIM Yeah , Mallory . How did you know ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY A man usually knows his own name . FRITZ You 're not  --  Callaghan Mallory , are you ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY I am . FRITZ How come ? Callaghan Mallory was born right here in this restaurant less than an hour ago . CALLAGHAN MALLORY I entered the world just as the illusion broke , consequently I was here all the time the illusion was unbroken , as well as all the time thereafter . HARRY 'S VOICE ( From the street ) Where 's that door ? Open up , let me in , I 've been here before . ( He breaks into the place ) For a while there I was afraid I 'd lost the place . Give me a drink , boys . p. 38 FRITZ Who 's that ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each of us . HARRY ( Delighted ) I suppose you guys are wondering where I came from , at a time like this . Well , let me tell you , there have been a lot of things holding me back , but , by God , one way or another , I 'm here . I 've brought six or seven diseases with me , but I 've got good news , too . Give me another drink . FRITZ We heard the good news , if you want to call it good . The illusion 's broken or something . Everybody 's dead or something . Is that right ? HARRY Take it easy , boys . Take it easy . ( To CALLAGHAN ) Who 're you ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY Callaghan 's the name . HARRY Oh , yes . I thought so . I 'm your father , I believe . Well , that 's fine . If you like , I apologize . She had a kind of helplessness that was irresistible . I liked her voice , the way she mispronounced words , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like that . I am speaking , I hope you understand , of your mother . Rhinelander 2-8182 . I never intended my affection for the freckles to set in motion energy endlessly deep in the past , and consequence far removed in the future , but , as you yourself by this time know , the order , or disorder , which governs this reality allows no alternative . Hence , yourself at this bar , by name Callaghan , a memorial , perhaps , to my eagerness and her freckles . I hope you have a pleasant visit . To the day after tomorrow , gentlemen . p. 39 FRITZ I do n't get it , but to the day after tomorrow . ( They all drink ) JIM What about tomorrow morning 's paper ? HARRY The message there is one that has been in every paper , morning or afternoon , since the beginning . JIM Some illusion or something is supposed to be broken or something , and five minutes ago when I went out to the street there was nothing there . What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps fortunately , temporary . FRITZ What do you mean ? HARRY Simply that , for a moment , for magnificent reasons , the eye was blind to the irrelevant and open to everything else . 52nd Street is again only 52nd Street . FRITZ We 're alive again ? HARRY If you choose to call it that . FRITZ Is my cab out there ? HARRY Unless it 's been stolen , or borrowed . FRITZ This is a hell of a note . JIM Everything 's the same again ? HARRY The same ? It 's worse , getting worse every minute . But it 's so in a way that 's irresistible to me , like her freckles . And , for one reason or another , irresistible to you , too . p. 40 FRITZ We 're right back where we started from ? HARRY Nobly , and with that delicate balance of despair and delight which glues all unrelated things into the continuity and architecture which are the fable and fantasy of this world and life . It took a lot of glue to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Scotch ; a lot of freckles to name you Callaghan . FRITZ Well , in that case , I guess I 'll get back to work . ( Music begins  --  Impromptu for Harp , by Gabriel Faur , Op. 86 , part 2 . Everyone moves slowly ) CALLAGHAN MALLORY It 's been pleasant drinking with you , gentlemen . ( He moves to go ) FRITZ Can I drop you somewhere ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY It 's not far . I 'll walk . There 's no hurry . I 've got all the time in the world . FRITZ You 've had a few to drink . Let me take you . What 's the destination ? CALLAGHAN MALLORY No . Thanks . I 'd rather take a little time . ( He goes ) FRITZ Where 's he think he 's going ? HARRY To his mother  --  to himself . To a little over seven pounds of something or other that breathes . To about an hour and a half of infinity . p. 41 FRITZ Well , so long , Jim . ( Pause ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JIM The big race ? FRITZ Yeah , who do you like ? JIM There was a jockey in here day before yesterday said a long shot might do it . A three-year-old named Tomorrow Morning . FRITZ Tomorrow Morning . The names they give them nags is something I ca n't figure out . I 'll bet him two on the nose , three to place , and five to show . I 'll lose , but I like the name . So long . JIM So long . ( HARRY stands alone , listening . JIM changes his coat and goes . HELEN and SAMMY go . PABLO and PANCHO , carrying tennis rackets , go . CALLAGHAN and PIPER go . CLAY goes . PEGGY comes in . HARRY turns . He stands looking at her a moment . He goes to her , takes her by the arm , and they go )                                  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
