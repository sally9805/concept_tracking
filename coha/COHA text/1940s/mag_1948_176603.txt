Not since the worst years of the Japanese war had China faced a prospect so bitter . The Communist autumn offensive had overwhelmed the Nationalists in Manchuria ; the vital North China corridor was under heavy attack . For the second time in a generation , a great Nationalist retreat was under way . Isolated outposts would now be evacuated and lines shortened to save men and materiel for a long war of attrition . <P> One exception to the Nationalist strategy of evacuation was Mukden ( see map ) , site of the best arsenal in all China . Twice in the last fortnight Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek had flown north to confer with General Wei Li-huang , Mukden 's commander , and stir him to a more active defense . As the garrison from starving Changchun hacked southward to join the Mukden forces , Wei 's columns drove down to retake the port of Yingkow , reopening Mukden to direct sea supply . More of Wei 's troops thrust west to relieve Chinhsien . <P> Open Door . Wei 's force did not make it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link in the Nationalist lifeline to Mukden and Changchun . From Chinhsien , supplied by rail from North China and by sea through the port of Hulutao , the Nationalists had flung an airbridge to Mukden . Chinhsien 's fall left Mukden dependent for supplies on Yingkow ( which freezes over in November ) , and after that on the long and hazardous airlift from Peiping and Tientsin . <P> Bad as this was , Chinhsien 's fall held a still graver threat : possession of Chinhsien opened to the Communists the northeastern door to North China . <P> The new danger caught North China 's Nationalist commander Fu Tso-yi badly off balance . A fortnight ago Communists had pushed up north of the Great Wall west of Tatung . When Fu 's troops dashed westward to drive them back , another Communist force from the north came down in their rear to strike the rail line west of Peiping , threatening to sever it completely and cut Fu 's army in two . If the Communists succeeded ' in this , Peiping , Tientsin and all North China would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist forces closed in for the kill on rich Taiyuan , capital of Shansi province . Like Mukden , Taiyuan has an excellent arsenal . During the last Communist attack on Taiyuan some months ago , Nationalist airborne reinforcements came in to save the day . This time it looked as if the outnumbered 40,000-man garrison would have to fight it out alone . <P> East of Taiyuan , General Chen Yi , conqueror of Tsinan , finished mopping up Shantung province and formed for a southward drive on Suchow , main Nationalist stronghold across Shantung 's southern border . <P> South of General Chen , the Communist offensive was in the hands of shrewd , slippery General Liu Po-cheng , " the one-eyed dragon . " Maneuvering down the rail line toward Hankow , Liu sent one column from his major force hell-for-leather down around Sinyang to feel out the railway defenses along the line south of the city . If Liu could cut the rail line , he would have Sinyang encircled and more than 100,000 Nationalist troops in the trap . Besides , by cutting the line he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaten the Yangtze Valley from Hankow to Ichang.
