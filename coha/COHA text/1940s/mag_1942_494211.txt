Where Do We Go from Here ? THE NEW REPUBLIC 'S editorial mail indicates that many American liberals are confused and disheartened nowadays . Some of them feel that liberalism suffered a serious defeat in the elections , when so many reactionaries and ex-isolationists were returned to office . There is also a feeling that appease ? ment is still in the saddle to some extent in Washington , as witness the Darlan and Otto Hapsburg episodes and the rumors of similar negotiations in regard to other countries . Alarm is expressed lest the reluc ? tance of the American and British governments to dis ? cuss peace aims and post-war plans means that our leaders are thinking of the sort of post-war world about which the liberals would be very unhappy indeed , chiefly on the ground that it would probably mean an ? other world war in twenty years . One man who is known and honored by all American liberals wrote to me a few days ago saying " we have already lost the peace . " It seems to me that these views of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certainly , they do not add up into any reason at all for a defeatist at ? titude . On the contrary , they justify us in fighting harder than we ever did in our lives , and with as good a chance of success , or a better one , than we have ever had before . I feel perhaps we are standing at the moment a little too close to the picture to get it in full perspec ? tive . Let 's step back for a moment or two . We are bound to recognize that President Roosevelt today is the spiritual leader of all mankind as no one else has been in modern times . Because he is so bitterly hated and opposed by one segment of the American middle class , we hardly realize to what extent he has become a symbol of hope to suffering humanity all over the world . Probably the convinced communists and fascists in all countries should be excluded ; their Minds are closed , just as the mind of a contemporary Mohammedan was dosed to the merits of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly the overwhelming majority of people in all lands look to the , President as the best symbol of hope for the future . When a prophet is not without hOnor save in his own country , it has usually turned out in the past that his own country was wrong . Second , we are prone to forget the amazing social Progress that this country made in the ten years of the New Deal . If any other nation ever underwent a simi ? lar metamorphosis in a similar time , without a violent I " Ovolution , I do n't know where . It took Great Britain 1tt least thirty years to come the same distance in regard to certain matters and seventy years in regard to others . In a mere decade we have gone from the philosophy of Coolidge to recognizing a full social respOnsibility for such individual calamities as undeserved unemploy ? ment and poverty-stricken old age . We now recognize what would have seemed like fantastic nonsense only fifteen years ago , that every citizen should have enough good food to maintain proper health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A former open-shop country where the unions were small , weak and on the defen ? sive has accepted the principle of collective bargaining . Do not be misled by the yowling of the Tories in the NAM . Even the new conservative Congress will not abolish trade unionism or come anywhere near doing so . It will probably act chiefly against such things as racketeering and the lack of civil liberties within the unions . The trade-union movement would be better off today if it had cleaned its own house long ago ; it would show.great intelligence if it would now abolish these evils which affect perhaps ro percent of all trade unions and are in fact centered upon the AFL groups in the building trades . But however fiercely the con ? servatives may roar , the final action will at worst be only a temporary setback for the trade-union move ? ment , a 5 or zo-percent loss to be balanced against a 7o or 8o-percent gain under the New Deal . In another great area , the American people have made tremendous advances . The country has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the rest of the world , and that we ca n't stay out of war by turning our back on developments abroad . People tell me that isolationism is still powerful in this country , that it affected this year 's election , that it will rise up to dictate a bad peace when the war is over . My answer is that I go by the record as expressed in con ? gressional legislation ; and that long before Pearl Har ? bor Congress had passed a series of important pieces of legislation recognizing our international responsi ? bility . If we did not know how important were those decisions , our enemies did . A high German official is quoted as having said , when I.eue-Lend was first cre ? ated : , " We have lost the war . We knew that Great Britain could not pay for the supplies she needed from America and we assumed that when her funds were exhausted , the Americans would let her go down . We never dreamed of anything like Lease-Lend . " It is true that sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victory was by a hair-raisingly narrow margin . Yet in the perspective of his ? tory it will be seen that Congress did , in the period from 1939 onward , what it had to do . These facts throw a good deal of light on the results in this year 's election . I am not whistling to keep up 8 my courage when I say that in my judgment , the elec ? tion results did not constitute any repudiation of gov ? ernment policy either at home or abroad . As many commentators have pointed out , there is always a swing away from the party in power at every midterm election , without necessarily implying any repudiation of its principles . The number of Democrats who stayed away from the polls was itself large enough to account for the overturn in favor of the Republicans , and there were good reasons why the Democrats failed to appear , reasons which did not include any turning against the New Deal . It is probably true that the election returns indicated a certain degree of irritation with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that irritation was justified and has appeared in the pages of The New Republic and other papers that are in general sympathetic with the administration . It seems clear that there has been more confusion , procrastination and error about our war effort than was necessary . But cer ? tainly half or more than half of what is wrong must be charged to the big-business interests of the country , which are almost always Republican in their coloration . It is they who refused to take war contracts until they had blackmailed the government into excessively gen ? erous terms . It is they who clung desperately to con ? tinued manufacture of consumers ' goods long after this should have been stopped . It is they who refused to license competitors to use valuable secret processes even in the common war effort . It is they who are still in some cases thinking more about their competitive post ? war position than they are about winning the war itself . In so far as the average voter has felt and ex ? pressed resentment over " Washington bungling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it exists , no one can doubt . But here again , it is not the general purposes of the administration that have been attacked , but the execu ? tion of agreed-upon policies . What the majority of the people undoubtedly were saying was : We approve of the direction in which you are going , but we want to go faster and farther , and we think having other in ? dividuals in the places of power will aid in doing that . In some of their choices , the people were probably mis ? taken ; in others , they were certainly mistaken ; but this , I am confident , is their general intention . If the Tories of both parties are foolish enough to believe they have a mandate to destroy the work of the past ten years , they will very quickly find how wrong they are . History teaches us that there is a wave motion in social progress , that a period of advance is followed by one where gains are consolidated , or a little ground le sometimes lost ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equal to the swing forward , is altogether wrong in a country where the popular will controls to the extent seen in the United States . Thera is , then , no reason for the liberals to be disheart THE NEW REPUBLIC ened about the general situation at home . Far from raising the white flag , now is the time for us to unite and fight as never before . What about the international picture ? Using , again , the historical perspective , it is worth while to step back briefly for a better view . In the last few months , we have gained a series of tremendous victories which , with characteristic short memory , we forget all too soon . A few months ago , it looked as though Russia would be beaten to her knees before the seemingly hesitant Allies could make up their minds to come to her aid . In Egypt , Rommel was almost at the gates of Alex ? andria , and his army had halted there only from ex ? haustion and not because of British resistance . Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India might be her next victim . America 's great resources remained immobilized while we struggled to get production under way . The liberals were appeal ? ing for a global strategy with no visible evidence that they were being heeded in Washington and London . Russia was the step-child of the Allies and China was only a step-child 's great niece . We have come a long distance since those days . Russia has fought back magnificently against the Ger ? mans , and she did so before our landing in North Africa had had any practical effect on her situation . The threat to Egypt has been ended and it is most un ? likely that it will recur . Our landing in North Africa , a marvelous achievement of logistics , has caused the whole war to fall into a new pattern which , as Max Werner points out , in fact constitutes a global strategy The United Nations intend to join in beating Hitler in Europe and will then turn their combined resources to the task of smashing Japan . As suggested above , the liberals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deal . with Darlan and the other similar deals that seem to be brewing . We must smash at once and forever anY reappearance among American officials of appeasement philosophy . Yet even here , there are some items to go into the good side of the balance . President Roosevelt has solemnly pledged himself that the use of Darlan is to be temporary , and that the people of France will have a full opportunity to choose whatever govern ? ment they wish at the end of the war . Similar pledges have been given , explicitly or implicitly , regarding , every other subjugated country . The very violence the storm that has been raised over Darlan in Britain , and America is proof of the vigorous good health ? I , democratic public opinion on this subject . Even it Washington or London wanted to tie up permanently to some turncoat fascist , I do n't see how they walla dare to do so after the public demonstration of concern that we have seen . To say this is not to minimize the size and extent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' biguous position in this war . In Europe it has bntit DECEMBER 21 ) 1942 democratic and anti-democratic elements , and the stresses of their conflict are reflected within the Church In America where there are also liberal and illiberal wings . The illiberal wing sometimes seems to exercise an influence in the American State Department out of all proportion to its real strength either in the Church or in the nation . Too many people still for special reasons of their own resist the profound and growing truth that this is a people 's war for worldwide democ ? racy . But on the whole , that concept is gaining ground . Overzealous censorship is doing its best , but is not en ? tirely succeeding , to keep from us the news of this rising recognition of human solidarity and common human aims , throughout the world . We are permitted to hear Churchill 's angry repudiation of freedom for India ; we are not permitted to hear of the many thou ? sands of solid British citizens who do not agree with Mr. Churchill on this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become faint-hearted because of the election re ? sults . They tell us that when the battle is as crucial as it now is , we must stand by the President at any cost . It is better , they say , to keep silent about small things that seem to us wrong , than to run the risk of losing everything in 1944 . I respect the sincerity of these men but I am sure that their tactics are unwise . The Presi ? dent , I am confident , welcomes criticism from the Left when it is just and reasonable in tone . He welcomes it , for one thing , as a counterweight to criticism from the Right . His best proof that he is not yielding unduly to our side is the demand from our side that he should yield still more . Moreover , it is a well known prin ? ciple of his not to try to go faster than public opinion will follow him . If we ask him to go in our direction , It is only fair that we should create the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . to say that our ? criticism gives the tories valuable ammunition . Truth ? ful criticism like ours is no help to the tories ; they have never used k in the past and it is unlikely they Would use it in the future ; they much prefer their own brand of poisonous venom . But finally , the liberals could not keep silent , or express a false enthusiasm even if they wanted to . The device would be too trans-Parent . The liberal 's main equipment is his dedication to telling the truth ; if he dropped it he would simply atop being a liberal . A worse calamity than a conserva ? tive victory in 1944 would be for the country to lose one of its most important internal centers of self-criti ? %Ism and of impetus toward progress . Pearl Buck , in her striking adddress the other night the dinner for the Nobel Prize Winners , which is *reprinted in part on pages 824 and 825 of this issue , suggested that the war for democracy has already been t , or turned into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final paragraph expresses a degree of hope for the future that makes me feel her statement that we the already lost should not be taken too seriously . At 815 any rate , I for one do not believe that this or any other aspect of the war for liberation has been permanently lost . We lose a battle now and then ; a salient is ironed out on one side or the other , but the battle itself is never lost until you acknowledge defeat ; and I do not be ? lieve those who are fighting for the century of the common man are in any such mood . What we have to do seems to me fairly dear . We must identify ourselves as closely as possible with labor , at the same time helping labor to clean its own house . We should get rid of the " summer soldiers " in our ranks , who want to fight only as long as the going is easy , and who stop shooting when they see the whites of their enemies ' eyes . In so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to demand that theirs shall be a native American radicalism dear of all suspicion of being manipulated by strings pilled in any foreign capital . We should refrain from announcing grandiose and far-distant objectives which will only serve to frighten the innocent bystanders and will not advance our cause . Instead , we should , while thinking in long-range terms , do most of our fighting for short-range and immediate objectives . We should try neither to exaggerate nor belittle our own importance in the scheme of things . If we propose objectives and these are finally brought into being by others who claim all the credit , we should not be concerned . There is lots of hard fighting ahead ; there is always lots of hard fighting ahead . But we have a record that justifies us in continuing to fight with full energy and full con fidence.
