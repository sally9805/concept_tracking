ON June 12 , 1940 , the Battle of France was ending in disaster . It was one of those incredible June days when it looked as if the weather man himself had turned totalitarian and joined forces with the enemy for the push into France . The North had fallen . German troops were sweeping south and west along the coast . Tanks and armored cars thundered over the roads of Normandy , ticking off the Channel ports like so many milestones . After Dunkerque and Boulogne , it was le Havre , Cherbourg , Granville . On the Brittany island where I had lived so many months ? ever since my husband 's ship had put to sea for an unknown destination ? we waited for the outcome , nerves strung to breaking , with a sense of utter isolation . No word from Andr6 for weeks ; the mails had stopped . The radio too had lost its voice , but we had no need of broadcasts to know what was happening . The news flashed across country at lightning speed . " They " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the outskirts of Rennes . The front was rushing toward us , to our far corner of Brittany . That June afternoon I watched our French sailors abandon the coastguard station , dumping munitions into the sea and making a bonfire of the rest charts , flags , rockets , and instruments ? before crowding into the launch that was to take them to Brest , or perhaps to England ? nobody knew for certain . I also watched the soldiers of our little garrison set up their machine guns on the hillock outside my garden wall ? set them up and take them down again , with blank-faced wrath and bewilderment as the order came to stack arms and abandon all resistance . " What are we here for anyhow ? " they clamored . " For nine months you kept us here doing nothing and now there 's a chance to fight you wo n't let us ! " The middle-aged lieutenant , as bewildered as his men , fumbled for words to comfort them . He found nothing to say except that orders were orders and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of machine guns and a handful of reserves . And besides , if the main French forces were beaten . . . At that one of the gunners spoke up . I can see him still in his patched horizon-blue uniform and wooden sabots ( after nine months of war , barely a dozen men of the company had received their army boots ) smudging away his tears with an angry fist . " Mon lieutenant , you must n't say we 're beaten . I was at Verdun . France ca n't be beaten like that . We 've been betrayed . " For the first time I heard that cry . It swept through the ranks everywhere at the time of the Armistice . " Nous ne sommes pas battus ; nous sommes trahis . " All the while planes were roaring overhead . Since morning the invasion had reached our sky . Heavy bombers , each with its escort of fighters , swung in from the horizon , flying so low that we ducked instinctively every time a group passed over . They were not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the soldiers said ? but repeated explosions came from the mainland . " What can we hope to do against all that ? " 6 t ? e lieutenant muttered . A messenger brought him a slip of paper that be read frowning , then tugged his mustache with , a sigh . " Well , Ines enfants , " he said , turning to the men , " it seems that the game is up . From now on , it 's every man for himself . Those of you who can , try to make your homes while there is still time . But you have no time to lose . The Boches are at St. Bricux ; they will be here to-morrow . " By nightfall , except for the lieutenant who stayed on to surrender the post , not a sailor or a soldier remained on the island . Our protectors had gone . Five hundred civilians left behind ; and the enemy expected sometime within the next twenty-four hours . It was a lonesome feeling . In the meantime there was nothing to do but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where could we run to ? If remote Brittany was invaded , where might we hope to find sanctuary ? Then too , we had seen too many refugees during the past weeks , streaming in by hundreds of thousands from Belgium and northern France , not to have learned the terrible lesson of the invasion . Whatever happened we were far safer at home than trapped on the crowded roads . After the soldiers left , dim memories of old wars set people digging in their gardens , burying silver and other valuables and hiding trunks of linen in the haystacks . A notice posted at the mairie ( town hall ) warned us against " hostile demonstrations " and ordered us to turn in firearms and other " dangerous weapons . " It resulted in an amazing collection of obsolete pistols , rusty swords , Chinese daggers , and African spears ( one careful lady even included the carving knife and meat-chopper in her bundle ) . But I dare say whatever modern weapons the islanders owned went prudentlyinto the ground along with the silver . As Rene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less wo n't be missed by the Germans . " And grimly , " They may come in handy for us one of these days . " II At 9 o'clock , Thursday June 13th , the first Germans reached the little port facing the island on the mainland , five miles away . The townspeople heard the thudding of motors and , peering through the slits of their shutters , saw three motor-cycles bound into the empty square . Three motor-cycles with three men in dusty green uniforms , their faces all but hidden under the heavy " dishpan " helmets . On the handlebars of one of the cycles was tied a bunch of roses . The machines drew up in the middle of the square , the men cast curious glances at the granite house fronts and shuttered windows , then one of the three swung his legs of the cycle , clumped across the cobbles to a cafe , and banged his fist on the closed door . It opened cautiously , the soldier raised his hand ? an international gesture ? thumb to his lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few minutes later a side-car carrying an officer joined the men in the square and after a brief halt wheeled off again in the direction of the town hall . Four motor-cycles , five men in uniform ? the town was " occupied . " It was fully an hour before other uniforms reached the port . This time four tanks rattled and roared through the main street and , without stopping , swung into the road toward Brest . Then followed the long procession of covered trucks ? mastodons caked with dust , closed tight ; but beneath the flapping curtain at the rear one caught glimpses of more green uniforms and the glint of metal . No bunches of roses here , but tied to either headlight of every truck was a French soldier 's helmet and a sailor 's blue beret with the red pompom . If the invaders hoped to win over the French they made a mistake there at the outset with those dangling trophies , exhibited like scalp-locks . To the average Frenchman mockery is more unforgivable than a massacre . Though none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we anticipated something pretty grim . We knew what had happened to civilians in the north and refugees on the road . As it turned out , nothing took place according to our expectations . For days the occupation of Brittany was all but invisible from the island . Regiments swarmed past on the mainland but none came to us . From the mainland came reassuring reports ? apparently the Germans were making an effort to be as unobnoxious as possible . It appeared they were " correct " in their contacts with the population and everything they took they paid for ? in marks to be sure , but you could change the marks for francs at any bank if you so desired . Pauline Legall , our grocer 's wife , who had gone to the mainland for provisions , told how a German soldier had carried her heavy basket all the way from the market to the pier . German soldiers had offered their seats to women in the autobus , one of them explaining in very creditable French : " We are nice people , you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Petit , a refugee from Lille ? her arm still bandaged from a machine-gun bullet received on the road ? had to give up her bag too , much against her will , to a hulking lad in uniform who told her it had to be so . Such were the " orders . " Orders or no orders , it was far from the treatment we had expected . In that first reaction of relief many people began saying that perhaps Germans were less black than they had been painted . In the little port across the strait , wooden-like sentinels stood guard before the Kommandantur , the handsomest house in town , belonging to a wealthy shipowner who had fled to the south . Rows of army trucks lined the quays ; and soldiers in green clumped in and out of the stores or stood about the doors of pastry shops stuffing down tarts and cakes . " They clean out the shop in fifteen minutes after each fourne'e ( baking ) , " Madame Tery , the patissiere , told me . " I never saw such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them and a dozen little cakes as well . They act as if they were famished . " Her brother , who owns the big caf ? on the square , said there was n't a bottle of champagne left in town . " It 's the only wine they know . They lap it up like cider . " And in a husky whisper , " They drink it in the morning ! " He also said if I wanted gas for my car he knew a sure way of getting it ? " Twenty liters for a bottle of Clicquotor anything that sparkles . They do n't know the difference . " He told me too that the soldiers had already emptied the shops of perfume , soap , fountain pens , silk stockings , and silk underwear . All that they sent to Germany to their families . " If they 've been deprived for years ? as they say ? I suppose it 's only natural , but still they ought n't to take everything we 've got . If they keep on I see hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've taken all the cream , the milk will go too . Did you know they 're buying up all the butter ? They fix the price at twelve francs a pound , then they go to the farmers and offer twenty . Yesterday there was n't a pound for sale at the market . " We had no butter on the island either . The merchant who came twice a week from the mainland failed to put in an appearance and local merchants said shipments from Normandy must be held up somewhere . None of them came through . Signs began to appear on the shops : " No butter , no oil , no coffee , no sugar , no soap . " And at the bureau de iabac , " No tobacco . " It was only the beginning . Exactly one week after the Armistice was signed I had my first direct contact with German soldiers ? in my own garden . The garde diamp ? ' tre , our local policeman , brought two officers to inspect the former French army post next door and called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with boots like mirrors ? they spoke beautiful French , were stiffly courteous , played with the dog , and made polite remarks about the view . They were also particularly anxious to be shown the villa of a French journalist known for his anti-Nazi writings who had taken refuge in England . Then , without warning , we were " occupied . " On the 3rd of July , 400 soldiers moved over to the island . A commission had come the day before , leaving sundry chalk marks on the doors of houses near the port and in the village : " 1 officer , 15 men ; 2 officers , 30 men . " All the hotels had their quota ; the office of one of them became the Kommandantur for the island . Beds , mattresses , blankets , and sheets ( sheets for soldiers Did they have sheets in German barracks ? ) were requisitioned in the empty houses of summer residents . The troops were billeted on the townspeople ; the former quarters of the French soldiers were left unoccupied . Did the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason ? We already knew that on the mainland they had left the old French barracks standing empty , billeting their men in schools and private houses ? a precaution against eventual British bombs . On our island the men in green were quartered within five hundred yards of the port . " They 're scared of getting trapped away from their boats , " the garde thorn-Pare confided . " They expect les Anglais to come over any minute ! " The launches that brought the men from the mainland crowded the little port . Beached on the sand lay rows of strange-looking craft : the famous rubber boats ? elliptical rubber rings like mammoth sausages 2 to 3 feet thick , inflated and stuffed with kapok . Each had a cleated wooden floor and was big enough to hold from 30 to 40 men . The launcheshad towed long strings of them to the island , bobbing over the waves like the jointed tail of some monstrous sea-serpent , while the islanders looked on with skeptical grins at this regiment of Loch Ness monsters . Did the Germans expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The launches also brought rafts in tow , loaded with army wagons and bunchy somethings hidden by tarpaulins that we took for guns . Horses too , blindfolded and held by uneasy-looking lads . For the first time the island was to be treated to the spectacle of men on horseback . Though the newcomers laughed boisterously , some of them looked quite pale ; it was clear they were not used to the sea . In the group of islanders at the port the grownups watched them in silence , but small boys giggled and , pointing first to the soldiers and then to the sea , yelled , " Gloo-gloo-Angleterre ? gloo-gloo , " and took to their heels . No soldiers were quartered in our end of the island , the wildest , wind-swept part , overgrown with gorse and bracken , facing the sea . I might never have made closer acquaintance with the men of Hitler 's army had it not been for nay cat . III The cat used to spend her days on the garden wall watching what went on in the lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , cock her head on one side , and reach down a playful paw , making overtures that were invariably successful . One day I heard boots scraping on the stones and a hand in a green sleeve reached up beyond the wall . The cat gave a surprised squall , wriggled free and escaped into the farmyard across the lane where my neighbor , Alain Lebras , was splitting wood for the fire . The soldier followed the cat but when he saw Alain he promptly forgot it . Stripping off his coat , he took the axe from the hands of the astonished peasant and fell to work on the wood pile . Now Brittany hospitality is no empty word and a stranger who chops wood for you on a hot July day , be he enemy or friend , deserves a glass of eider . Alain filled a bottle from the barrel in the shed and brought out a couple of glasses ; then , as he understood not a word of the guest 's conversation , he sent his wife across the lane to ask Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first real contact with the Army of Occupation ? in the person of one Emil Herter , private soldier in the ? th Engineers , he too a peasant , from the hills near Munich . There was nothing specifically Aryan about him ? he was undersized and stringy-haired with no outstanding trait of color or feature . He might even have passed for a Frenchman , Alain 's wife declared , except that there was something queer about his mouth ? she guessed it was too big . The soldier had a pleasant smile , but a hard glint showed now and then in his eyes . I noticed it several times during that first conversation , which at first was less a conversation than an interrogatory . He was glad to find someone who spoke his language but " How do you happen to speak German ? Where did you learn it ? Have you ever been in Germany ? When ? What are you doing in this far corner of Brittany ? Do n't Americans speak the same language as the British ? " And where was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I possessed no more information than he did . My " arm " was on the sea and I had had no news of him for weeks . At that the hardness went out of the soldier 's eyes and he said with a rueful laugh that he was worse off than I. He had not seen his wife and boys for nearly a year ? and he had been fighting all the time , in Poland , in Norway , and just now in France . The change in the man was so sudden it was bewildering . In a breath he went on telling me what a terrible thing war was : he had been through hell in Poland , had lost all but 30 out of 140 comrades on the Aisne , had almost gone crazy sitting in the icy mudof the Siegfried line last winter , and that if the war dragged on a second winter anything might happen , even a revolution . I made no comment at all to that . After the quizzing I had just been through , it sounded like provocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later ? that in each German soldier there are two distinct persons : the man ? a man like everyone , with wife and children and spontaneous reactions ? and in addition , the Nazi ? who recites a lesson . ( You could almost hear the quotation marks . ) The two are rarely in harmony , nearly always in flagrant opposition , and what is still more startling , neither the " man " nor the " Nazi " seems aware of the contradiction . I made the observation over and over again . An example , by way of illustration . " You seem to be great friends with the Italians , " I said on one occasion . ( I may add that I learned to avoid direct questions , for when I did , the Nazi bobbed up inevitably with an evasive reply . ) " You think we arc friends ? Oh , Hitler and Mussolini ? yes , to be sure , they are old comrades . But as for the people ? I have known Italians . They 're all alike ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look at the way they came into the war . They 've got something of the Jew and the Nigger in their makeup . But ( this with dignity ) of course I wo n't say anything against the Italians , because they are our al-lies ! " Altogether that first meeting with the man in green left an uncomfortable impression . Was he a creature of the Gestapo and was the cat incident merely a pretext for making contacts with the native population on our north shore ? Or was not every German soldier , by definition , a potential spy and informer ? That night I heard the latch of the garden gate click and the sound of boots on the gravel . I hurried to the door . It was Emil Herter again , this time all smiles and cordiality . He greeted me like an old friend . " I hope I 'm not disturbing , g , nd Frau , but ? " he fumbled in the deep pocket of his baggy trousers and drew out a quart bottle filled with yellow liquid . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island . One of my Kameraden picked up this . He thought it was white wine . It is of no use to us ? perhaps you can use it . " Oil ? it was the first I had seen in weeks . And a whole liter ! " Where did your comrade buy it ? " " He did n't buy it . " Another broad grin . " Er hat ' s organisiert " ( he " organized " it ) . Organisieren ? to expropriate . That , I learned , was the meaning of the word in soldier slang . So it was loot he offered me , taken no doubt from one of the vacant villas . He noticed my hesitation . " It did no good where it was . The people it belonged to are in Paris . Rich people who live a lot better than you . They have two houses ? nobody has a right to two houses . Some of the empty villas here have cellars full of wine . And the rest of you on the island , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) " Do you think that is right ? " I had heard the soldiers were emptying the cellars of unoccupied houses . It was the first sort of looting that occurred on the island . I had not heard , however , that the wine had been distributed among the population . Could I accept that bottle of oil ? My neighbor Madame Lebras saw no reason to hesitate . Oil was oil , she said . You could n't be too squeamish in wartime . And well , it was just so much the " Prussians " would n't get ! She carried off her share of the bottle without a qualm , and that night at least two families on the island had fried potatoes for their supper for the first time in many weeks . From that day on I had frequent callers . Apparently it had been noised abroad that in our corner of the island was a lady who spoke German . I suspect too that I had been listed somewhere ? possibly on the lists of the Kommandantur ? as " Deutschfreundlich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walkinginto garden and house as if they belonged there . At first on all sorts of pretexts ? did n't I have potatoes to dig or wood to cut ? At last , without the shadow of a pretext , they simply came and stayed . All were common soldiers , the humble cogs of Hitler 's great war machine . Peasants for the most part : Hans the Rheinl ? nder , Erie , Emil , and Wolfgang from the 13avarian hills , and Karl August from the " hunger-districts " of East Prussia , struck with amazement at the fertility of our rich black soil . Johann Fuchs and Hermann StOtter , on the other hand , came from the factories of Frankfurt and Diisseldorf ; and Helmut Muller from Berlin . Most of them were so like the blue-uniformed peasants who had been my neighbors all winter that it was sometimes startling . And yet there was always a difference . The " Nazi " stood ever in the shadow , like a watchful censor , particularly when two or more soldiers were present ; though when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he intruded in the conversation it came like an afterthought . " Of course I am speaking to you als Mensch , as man to man . I say things I would n't say as a soldier . Though if I thought you were hostile to us or our allies I 'd tap you on the shoulder and say ' Follow me . ' If you tried to betray me I 'd say , ' The woman lies . ' And I should he believed , not you . A soldier 's word is always taken before a civilian 's ? except when it 's a question of rape . They 're strict about that , you know . " All were eager to talk . After the months of soldiering , they said , it was good to be in a family atmosphere and forget the war . They were all in their late twenties and early thirties , with wives and babies at home ? babies who had not yet seen their fathers or would not recognize them when they came home . I saw their pictures and heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the little ones fed and clothed . We in France were fussing over food shortages and restrictions ? it had been like that in Germany for years . " Meine Frau , like all the women , wears wooden-soled shoes , ' Johann Fuchs told me . " They go clop , clop , clop in the streets . I 've sent her two pairs of leather ones with high heels , and little blue ones for the baby . And a little knitted woolly coat . We have no wool , you know , at home except for soldiers . Our ' wool ' looks and feels like the real thing , but it is n't warm . They say it 's made out of wood and glass . " Helmut Muller said his wife had asked for powder and rouge . She wanted silk underwear too . I said I had heard that German women were not supposed to use rouge . He nodded with a grin . " Das ist Propaganda ? but you know how women are . In Berlin you see lots more elegant women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kurfiirstendam with their lips and nails painted blue . That is the latest Pariser Mode . " Karl August had sent home coffee , five pounds of it , " organisiert " in an abandoned shop in the north of France . He had not sent it by post ? that was too dangerous . There were a lot of new people in the post office who stole half of what passed through their hands . He had given it to a comrade who was going home on leave . " Maybe he 'll take part of it , but at least he 'll leave something for my wife . " Helmut Muller had been married for four years but he had only one child . Was that not exceptional ? I asked . I thought Germans went in for large families . He laughed goodnaturedly . " Das ist auch Propaganda . What good are children when you ca n't feed them ? My wife says she wo n't have another , not for a long time . " In Helmut 's wallet , together with the photographs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? pictures of girl friends , he said . " Have n't you a good many girl friends for a married man ? " " But soldiers are men , " he answered , " and when you are months away from home . . Though our army is strict . You 're not supposed to ? well , have relations with any woman who is n't a professional . " That was for reasons of hygiene , he assured me , since France , as everyone knew , was rotten with venereal disease and the army could keep a careful check on " professionals . " But there was also another reason . " The girl might have Jewish blood and you 'd be responsible for another Jewish baby . You 've got to think of the Race . " " I suppose you could n't imagine losing your heart to a Jewish girl ? " The Nazi glint that had shot through Helmut 's blue eyes when he said " Jew , " went out like a candle-flame . " Oh but I have ! " he said ecstatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know what Liebe is ? She was a fine girl too , " he went on dreamily , " but " ? and his voice hardened again ? " I saw to it that there were n't any children . " The men in green had much to say on the Jewish question . That is , they all said the same thing , quoted verbatim from the Nazi lesson book : the Jews had plotted to dominate the world ; they held all the democracies in their grip ; they were responsible for the war and all the misery it caused ; they were vermin that had to be destroyed . Karl August said he thought some Jews were decent people just the same . There had been a man in his town , a rich Jew who kept a store . He gave land for a school for backward children , lent horses to break the ground for the foundation , and paid for the labor . A nice man , but when Hitler came to power , he had to go . " The good ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our conversations steered away from politics . That , I gathered , was forbidden ground ; besides , all the necessary thinking on such matters had been done by the author of Mein Kampf . Even talkative Helmut was chary of expressing his views before a comrade . That attitude of mutual distrust was characteristic . It looked as if the famous Kamaradschaft were purely superficial ? a thing commanded and imposed while underneath it was every man for himself . It seemed as forced as the " spontaneity " of the soldier choruses that rang from one end of the island to the other as the men marched by . " Singen ! " shouted the Unteroffizier and the song rang out , as timed as if he had ordered , " Fire ! " I never heard soldiers sing unless they were ordered . Yes , there was a curious lack of solidarity among these brothers in arms . One day I saw three soldiers drinking together at a caf ? in the village . One of the three was noisily drunk . He announced to the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to-morrow and I 'm never coming back . Never , you understand . The verfluchter Krieg can go on without me ! " His friends did what they could to calm him . They looked uncomfortable and kept casting uneasy glances toward the other customers , all of them French . At last their companion got to his feet , reeled over to the bar and demanded more cognac . It was refused him , whereupon the soldier fumbled at his belt , dragged out his knife and made threatening passes at the barman 's belly . The other two soldiers sprang up from their table ? we expected to see them lay hold on their friend and lead him off to bed . Instead of that , they dashed out the door and returned with an officer . The Frenchmen present were dumfounded . Give over a comrade to an officer ? the traditional enemy ! Such a thing , they said , could never have happened in the French army . Though the Germans drank heavily , one saw fewer drunken soldiers than might have been expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk in public was only slightly less serious , the soldiers said , because of the bad impression it gave the French . After the first novelty of drinking wine wore off , the men said they fell back on beer and brandy , by preference . They could n't stand the wine ; it gave them rheumatism . But it may have been the damp sea air ? and the wettings they gotin the Channel during rehearsals for the invasion of Britain . Iv These invasion rehearsals went on daily , all along the coast . Before daybreak launches towing strings of rafts and rubber boats set out to sea ; then , sheltered by a smoke screen , they made their way back again and the troops took the island by storm . The summer was warmer than usual , but the water along the coast was always cold ? colder than any he had ever felt , Hans the Rheinlander said . The men shivered in their drenched fatigue uniforms ? coarse white cotton drill ? on top of which they wore all their military equipment plus a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life preservers of the region and all the rubber boots ( most of the fishers I knew had buried theirs rather than hand them over ) . All through July and August rehearsals went on , alternated with swimming lessons on the one beach of the island . Civilians had been warned to keep away from the spot they were " attacking " ; but everything the soldiers did was clearly visible from the heights above the shore . When the men first came they told us that September first had been set as the date for the invasion of Britain . Later , they said it had been postponed until the 15th . About the 15th , however , something disastrous took place . We never learned the particulars ? the soldiers themselves were no better informed than we . But something dreadful , they said , had happened . Both they and we had heard that British planes bombed transports near Brest and St. Malo . Had there been an attempt at invasion or only another rehearsal ? We knew that there were many victims ? the figures the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For days , parties scoured the coast at low tide hunting for bodies . Fishers from Granville said fishing was interrupted for ten days on the Normandy coast because of the number of corpses washed ashore . We heard they were burned as soon as found . We heard too that the bodies that came ashore were already half-burned , and the story circulated that British planes had sprayed the ships with oil and then dropped fire bombs . What seemed more probable was that the bombed ships were oil burners and that the oil from their tanks took fire . Rumor no doubt exaggerated the story , but it was clear that something serious had taken place . For then it was that the date for the invasion of Britain was again postponed ? this time indefinitely . It would not take place before spring , Helmut Muller said . He had already told me of the plan of invasion as he knew it . The British ports and coast defenses were first to be destroyed . A strip of coast fifteen miles deep had to be completely razed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped out , the Germans would enter England " as easy as walking into butter . " But the British ports still stood and every day we had proof that the RAF was alive and active . British airmen repeatedly bombed Brittany airports from which German planes left nightly for raids on Britain . The beacon that used to sweep our sky to guide the returning Stukas was soon extinguished . Then the bombers ceased to roar overhead on the road toward Britain . At last only reconnaissance planes passed over us sometimes Ger-man , sometimes British . It looked as if the German raiders had retreated inland to safer quarters . " Their aviation is strong , " Karl August murmured , squinting up at a plane that passed out at sea , so high it was barely more than a silver speck in the afternoon sky . " I think Hitler himself underestimates its strength . " He told me that of course , if worse came to worst , they would have to use poison gas for the invasion . Indeed , every indication pointed to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No need to be squeamish ; the Poles used it ? they got the gas from the English . It 's unfortunate though that the prevailing winds over Britain blow from the west . That 's the trouble with gas ? you always have to wait for a favorable wind . " The men pointed to the barges that for days during late August and early September crept cautiously along the coast . Some of them were painted with fantastic streaks and patterns , white on black . ( " Night camouflage , " Johann Fuchs explained . ) " We 're going across on those things , packed in like herring . We 've gone through fire ? now they 're going to drown us . Gloo-gloo ! " they laughed , but the laughter rang hollow . During all the talk about invading England I heard not one word of enthusiasm . At times the " Nazi " recited the lesson heard that morning ( every morning , the men received Unterricht , an official commentary on the war situation , given by an officer ) : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our tanks , the ground mines that explode waist high and scatter 3,000 bullets , the thermite bombs that melt concrete and steel . We 'll wipe out England in three weeks . " So spoke the Nazi , but first the sea must be crossed ; and the sea filled every man with apprehension . Comments were gloomy . " Our generals are all landsmen , they do n't know the sea . They do n't take it into account . But they wo n't stop for that . What does it matter to them how much it will cost in men ? Do you know what a German soldier is , gna ' Frau ? He 's a post card , that 's all . When he gets killed send another post card ! Another man takes his place . " And again , " When I think of all I 've been through ? it 's a miracle I 'm still alive . If I 've got to risk drowning on top of all the rest I 'd like to blow out my brains now . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Always that haunting temptation of suicide . It ran through their conversations like a left-motizr . And there were suicides among the German troops in our neighborhood , almost an epidemic at one time ( seven in one week , Helmut Miller told me ) . Though that came later , when the news of the British bombing of German cities first leaked out . Were there no seamen in Germany ? the Brittany sailors wondered . " Not one of these fellows knows how to handle a canol , " they said . It was only too true . The Germans had gathered up all the launches along the coast and shattered them on the rocks during their rehearsals . They lay under water at high tide , their engines coated with salt . Of all the motor craft belonging to the island only one remained seaworthy , and when the weather grew stormy French seamen were requisitioned to run it . The restrictions the Germans imposed on sailing craft threatened at one time to hold up fishing all along the Brittany coast . It came about in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the port on the mainland met a British submarine . It hailed them in a friendly fashion , the Britishers bought their fish for a generous sum , and treated the men liberally to drinks . They returned , delighted with their adventure , and boasted of it openly . Within a few days everyone on the coast had heard the story . Almost at once fishing restrictions were posted : " All boats must anchor daily in the same place , at the same hour . All boats must leave together at the same hour daily and fish in a square not over 500 yards in width and not over five miles from the coast . " The notice met with scornful laughter . " What about the fish ? Have they too been notified ? " For several days the fishers sulked . Then , mysteriously , the notice disappeared and soon afterward the boats went out singly as before . Each carried two flags , the French tricolor at " half-mast " beneath the white flag of the Armistice . Those who neglected to do so risked being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port at sundown , and the men 's papers were always carefully scrutinized when they went ashore for fear a British agent might have slipped in among the crew . The Germans kept a careful lookout for Britishers . All through August and September they expected them constantly . As many rumors circulated among the German troops as among French civilians . One night , according to Hans the Rheinlander , the troops on the mainland sat all night at their guns waiting for their arrival . A launch set out with a messenger to warn soldiers on the island . But the messenger met a rock on the way , narrowly escaped drowning , and spent the rest of the night up to his waist in water waiting to be rescued . One more launch was added to the wrecks along the coast . On the night of the 19th of September ? it was a dark , rainy night ? three men landed with a rowboat on the north shore of the island and stopped at Rene the postman 's to ask for food and something hot to drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were French sailors returning from England , but their French was queer , Rene said , and they inquired very particularly about German patrols and where they could best land without attracting attention . They may have been British agents , although Rene suggested they might even be Germans , posing as British to see how the islanders received them ! In any case , they got a cordial reception , were fed and warmed and helped on their way , and we heard nothing more of the matter , though from then on German patrols stopped at houses from time to time on their nightly rounds and searched them thoroughly . V Every week or so British planes showered us with leaflets , some from the Free French forces telling us to keep up our courage , others warning us to stay away from airfields and concentrations of German troops . We were forbidden to read them under penalty of fines and imprisonment . Only children under ten were authorized to pick them up and they were supposed to turn them in at once to the German authorities . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Kommandantur . The leaflets passed from hand to hand and ended at last in the kitchen stove . So far we had been allowed to keep our radio sets , though from time to time the rumor circulated that they were to be taken from us . One day , late in September , the garde chanydtre brought news that the Germans had called them in . We were ordered to carry them to the Kommandantur that afternoon . However , Wolfgang , the Bavarian , who accompanied the garde , made a reassuring gesture behind the Frenchman 's back . " We are only going to choose ten of the best for ourselves and give the others back . Do n't bother to turn in yours ; it might be taken . " The radio was our greatest comfort in those days , and though listening to British broadcasts was strictly forbidden ( fines and prison as always ) , no one I knew listened to much else . We never admitted the fact , though the soldiers asked us repeatedly if we knew what the BBC was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical programs from England . " Theirs are always so gay . Ours are dismal ? solemn music , just like a funeral . All you have to do is tone down the loud speaker between numbers so people outside wo n't hear English spoken . " Karl August was n't the only one to express grudging admiration for the British radio . " It 's unbelievable , " Helmut Miiller said . " Here they are getting blown up every night and yet they go on singing and dancing and playing jazz just as they always did . " When British planes began bombing German cities I learned a surprising fact about German soldiers and the British radio . Johann Fuchs dropped in one afternoon , very much excited . " Have you heard ? The British have bombed Berlin ? they have hit tinter den Linden . The Potsdcanmer Bahnhof is on fire , the Lehrter station too . One of our men saw it ; he came back to-day from Urlaub ( leave ) . So it 's true what they say I " " What who says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to British broadcasts ? " " Of course we do . It 's forbidden of course , but a soldier can do anything . Ein Soldat macht was er will ! Our radio tells us nothing . They 're keeping things from us . " The news of the bombing of Berlin upset Muller even more than the others . His wife and boy were there . He told me of a soldier who had received a letter saying his family had been killed in a bombardment and who had shot himself . There was a rumor that the German censor intended to hold up letters to keep bad news from leaking out . If so it was " gemein " ( a dirty trick ) . " First they said no British planes could ever get through to G-crmany . Then they said they 'd never fly over Berlin . Now they say British bombs are n't worth anything ? they do n't do any harm . " All that was nothing but lies ? and it too was " gemein . " He told me the soldiers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been bombed and who had been killed . He said later it had been refused . " They say it would be giving information to the enemy . As if the British did n't know what they had bombed and where ! " VI In the meantime the war showed no signs of ending . The soldiers grew depressed . Hitler had promised it would all be over by Christmas , but no one believed it any longer . Even the French were better off than the German soldiers . The French were conquered but many had come home to their families , whereas the Germans had not seen theirs for months ? and who knew when they would see them again ? They were fed up with the war . Hans the Rheinlander put the general feeling into words . " Only ten thousand people at most , in all the world , ever want war ? the people high up . " Of course the British were to blame and the Jews . Germany never wanted war , Germany wanted justice and a new order in Europe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom . Everyone has to go wherever he is sent and do whatever he is told . Sometimes we feel uncomfortable ? those of us who remember the old days . But our children wo n't know anything but this and they 'll think everything is perfect . Of course after the war things will be better . Hitler says things will be better . Only we never thought the war would last so long . " Talk about the war grew increasingly bitter . Why should Britain stand always in the way of German hopes and plans ? " What made her interfere when we went into Poland ? Someone had to clean up Poland . " That experience in Poland had been a nightmare . All the soldiers said the same thing about it ? it was n't war , but sheer butchery . Guerilla warfare is no warfare , it is n't " honorable . " That was the way the Poles fought ? they all took part , even the women and children . " They shot at us from windows and trees and behind walls ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogs . I lost my gun four times ? all I had left was a knife . I was all covered with blood like a butcher . A barber cut the throat of one of my comrades he was shaving . We tied the man to his chair and threw a grenade under it . The women were the worst of all . We had to do dreadful things , but the Poles were to blame . They fought like savages . War is for soldiers , not civilians . A German is an edler Mensch . He fights in uniform . " Now they were in France . They had beaten the French , but the French did n't seem to know they were beaten . They were a funny people . " I guess you do n't realize how nice we 've been . We could have done what we did in Poland . You ought to be grateful . You do n't know what war is . Your women run a mile when they see us , the children too , though you know how fond we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was asked that question many times . For it was true , ever increasingly true , the French population had no love for the invaders . French and Germans were two parallel and hostile worlds . There was almost no interpenetration . Sailors who had come home from England after the first shock of the Armistice regretted their return openly . I had to explain and explain again to the neighbors my own contact with the German soldiers . Their continued visits were embarrassing . Madame Lebras , who from the first had done what she could to help me ? dropping in with her knitting every time she saw a green uniform enter the garden ? defended me with energy . " What can she do ? They just keep coming , and she ca n't throw them out . They are the conquerors . " By this time summer had gone . Since July a wall of silence had shut off occupied France from the rest of the world . Still no news from my husband ? already five months . No news from my sisters or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare friends who had not fled to the south and " family post cards " which the Germans had at last allowed us to exchange with unoccupied France . The cards were printed forms like the ones I used to receive from Andre , " somewhere " with the Fleet . ( " Health . . Send me . . . Sentiments . . . " ) For these " family post cards " the careful Germans had thought out all the details of our correspondence in advance and specified even the greetings . They ran as follows : Ever since August food conditions had been growing steadily worse . We now had ration cards for bread , meat , sugar , coffee , soap , fats , and fuel ; but the cards did us little good , for with the exception of bread flour , few supplies came through . Our " coffee " was roasted barley . No soap or oil had been on sale for months . What sugar we obtained ( 1 pound a month ) was in the form of stony cubes of a mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when crushed . We suspected the Germans of taking our good sugar and replacing it with an ersatz . Meat too was scarce since butchers were now forbidden to buy sheep and cattle from the farmers . There was even a shortage of salt ? the baker mixed his dough with sea water and we used sea water to salt our soup . The soldiers blamed the blockade for the food shortage ; once more it was the fault of the British . No one believed them . We knew where our butter , eggs , and potatoes went and who was buying up the sheep and cattle and shipping them out of the region . And while we lacked for food , the soldiers ' canteen was stocked with good things : jam , coffee , ham , sausage , butter , cheese , and eggs . We peered in enviously through the windows , but were not allowed the sight for long ? the Germans painted the panes . The soldiers always claimed their rations were inferior to those of the French army . In theory , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , stew and bread at noon . For breakfast and supper they had bread and coffee . However , this was conquered France and the bread was white , while with it went a big chunk of butter and ham or sausage and cheese . What was more , the soldiers had money to spend for extra food . They received 2 marks ( 40 francs ) a day , eighty times as much as French soldiers were paid . The Germans were supposed to have ration cards for what they bought in the shops and to take their turn in the lines that waited outside for provisions . Yet I neverheard of a soldier presenting tickets at a shop and never saw one standing in line . They always walked in ahead and were first served . Who could prevent them ? At all hours of the day you saw them eating . Apparently their appetites knew no bounds . However , even food lost its novelty for them . They were not happy . We could see that . They had come to Brittany keyed up for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? their morale was sagging . Once the autumn storms began the invasion rehearsals had been almost completely abandoned . As a substitute , intensive drilling took place on the village square and on the rifle range that had been leveled at one end of the island . On the village square groups of new recruits ? lads in their teens ( none of them looked twenty ) ? practiced the goose step ? a spectacle that convulsed the islanders . Four in a row , they held one another by the waist like chorus girls , to keep from tipping over backward as they flung their legs in the ataxic kick that always seems about to detach them from the trunk . Was this sufficient to keep old soldiers busy and contented ? Apparently the powers that run the German army did not think so . So it was that one afternoon late in October I received a delegation ? Karl August , Hans the RheinBinder , Johann Fuchs , and Helmut Muller . All were wearing brand-new uniforms and long winter coats that flapped in the wind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " going home on leave . Maybe we 'll still he there for Christmas . After that , they say they 're going to send us east , to the eastern front . " " The eastern front ? " " Yes , to Bulgaria ? or some place like that . It will be warm there anyhow . " " So you 're not going to invade Eng-land ? " They beamed happily . " Oh of course , next spring . But we 'll be gone . The others will have to do it . "
