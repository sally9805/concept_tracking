In a season of fast- &-furious; substitution , Southern Methodist 's " iron man , " Quarterback Doak Walker , played 48 minutes out of every 60 . When he was on the bench , the team seemed lost . Doak carried the ball , threw passes , did the punting , called signals , scored eleven touchdowns , kicked 22 points after touchdown , blocked viciously-and , outside of Arkansas ' Clyde Scott , was probably the best defensive back in collegiate football . He weighed only 168 Ibs . <P> Last week , Doak Walker won the Heisman Trophy , awarded the " player-of-the year , " following in the footprints of Johnny Lujack ( 1947 ) , Glenn Davis ( 1946 ) and Doc Blanchard ( 1945 ) . Said soft-spoken Doak , who does not seem as impressed with himself as everybody else is : " I sure appreciate it . " <P> He was everybody 's All-America . Only two other players , both linemen , were unanimous on the big All-Americas ( Collier 's board of coaches , Look 's Grantland Rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> <P> One was Minnesota 's 250-lb . Tackle Leo Nomellini , amateur boogie-woogie pianist and short-order cook who never played football in high school . Extremely fast for his weight , Leo was the star of the line that held Michigan 's great offense to 22 yards net gain by rushing . The other lineman was Penn 's 220-lb . Center Chuck Bednarik , alias The Clutch , a bear for handing out punishment . <P> Selectors gave special consideration to men who played both offense and defense ( an increasing rarity under the two-platoon system ) . This favored all-around players like Notre Dame 's Lineman Leon Hart , and made it tough on headline heroes like Army 's Stephenson and Stuart , who rode the bench when the other team had the ball . <P> No University of Southern California player made All-America-though U.S.C. gloriously wound up the season last week by tying Notre Dame , 14-14 . The tie broke Notre Dame 's string of victories at 21 , one more than Knute Rockne 's record .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
