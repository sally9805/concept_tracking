The basic course of U.S. strategy in the war against Japan was changed last week . Outwardly , it had already changed to some extent because of the worsening situation in China , marked by General Stilwell 's recall . But the U.S. joint Chiefs of Staff had long known the sad truth about China 's military plight and had discounted its effects . What really and radically changed the picture was the Second Battle of the Philippine Sea . <P> This was no Tsushima ( which decided a war ) , but neither was it a Jutland ( in which the victors lost more than the vanquished and failed to realize they had won ) . There was no precedent for this battle , unexampled in the vastness of the area over which it was fought , in the number and air strength and gun power of the ships engaged . The Japanese main fleet was " defeated and routed " : perhaps only 10% was sunk , but 30 to 40% was so damaged that it would not be able to fight again for months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the U.S. fleet control of the westernmost reaches of the Pacific . For how long ? U.S. naval officers , wizards in ship repair , were confident that the Japs could not patch up their battered craft in less than three months . It would take them longer if Jap dockyards could be bombed . And U.S. planners , in Washington and Pearl Harbor , would know how to use those months . <P> China no longer beckoned Admiral Nimitz to her shores , so the Navy must win footholds among the islands closer to Japan than Samar or Saipan , the present limits of the power drive and 1,500 miles from the goal . Available sites for the next invasion on the direct route to Tokyo : Formosa , the Ryukyus , the Bonins . <P> From these footholds , Japan must be bombed . A sideswipe at the China coast might yield another " island " ( an isolated beachhead would do ) to rivet down the U.S. iron collar around Japan 's jugular . <P> In one action-filled week , the mainland of Asia from Burma to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military backwater . The roads to Japan lay clearly outlined , to war planners and laymen alike : through the islands . And the perspective was shortening.
