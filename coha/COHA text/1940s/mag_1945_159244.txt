In the U.S. , words like cold and hunger had a remote and dimly remembered sound . Thanksgiving turkeys arrived in market by the carload ; to get more mincemeat on the holiday table , OPA raised the ceiling price 2 a pound . Shoe rationing was over ; department stores were taking orders for Christmas nylons . <P> The Congress was still bogged deep in debate over the United Nations Relief &; Rehabilitation Administration . Although the nation had long since pledged $1,350,000,000 ( 1% of its 1943 national income ) to UNRRA , the final $550,000,000 was still unappropriated . Why ? Because the House had tacked on an amendment barring use of the funds in countries which do not give free access to U.S. news correspondents ( i.e. , Russia and her satellites ) , and UNRRA 's U.S. representatives said this provision was unworkable . <P> Last week UNRRA 's Director General Herbert H. Lehman told a House Committee what damage the delay had done . Pressed for funds , UNRRA had been forced to drop $50,000,000 in orders for " critically needed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now UNRRA was completely broke . <P> The New York Times , which often acts as the nation 's conscience , took two full pages to report the findings of its correspondents on Europe 's plight : <P> " More than 20,000,000 desperate and homeless people are now milling east and west , north and south , across the Continent . . . . In all things that it takes to keep body and soul together . . . Poland is severely lacking ; 800,000 are now living in holes in the ground and dugouts . . . . <P> " Rumania is suffering from the worst drought in 50 years . . . . The average Norwegian must wait one full year before he can hope to have a new pair of shoes . Stockings are unobtainable . . . . The resistance of Europe is low . Tuberculosis is rife . The very young and the very old especially are beginning to die in droves as the autumn leaves fall . . . . " <P> Herbert Lehman also asked the Congress to lose no time in appropriating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he explained , must be bought four to six weeks in advance of shipping , medical items 90 days in advance , clothing even longer . Unless the money was available before year 's end , UNRRA would have to stop buying and its shipments would halt in February . <P> But Congress , angry at UNRRA bungling ( of which there has been plenty ) , worried about misuse of UNRRA funds in Russian-controlled areas ( of which there have been persistent rumors ) , seemed to regard UNRRA as just another leisurely political issue . <P> In China , where the land has been ravaged by eight years of constant warfare and " migration , nobody yet has even dared estimate the needs of the people . <P> For two precarious days , UNRRA 's future looked black . Republican leaders stuck by a recent report from their Food Study Committee , which recommended that 1 ) all future UNRRA appropriations be viewed with " jaundiced eyes , " 2 ) all appropriations be subject to the free press provision . Then one farseeing Republican rose in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg : " I am unable to agree that we should suddenly choose UNRRA , on the threshold of winter , as the vehicle for freedom of the press . . . .
