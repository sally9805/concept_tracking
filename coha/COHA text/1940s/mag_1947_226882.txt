In Mexico , where art sometimes crowds murder and politics off the front page , jailbirds are turning their cells into studios . Last week modern Mexican Painter Rufino Tamayo ( TIME , Feb. 17 ) , who now teaches art in Brooklyn , was combing Mexico 's prisons for new talent . Tamayo was sure he would find enough for a fall show at the Brooklyn Museum Art School . <P> Mexican prisoners scorn anything like escape art . Instead of landscapes , birds , or flowers , most of them daub away at private horrors . Samples : a half-human fetus turning away in fright from a street , a huge fist clutching eight cadavers , skeletons , three starved men craning their necks to catch driblets from a single spoon . One lifer , condemned for the murder of his wife and children , had dreamed up a lovely woman trailing blood across his cell floor . <P> This behind-bars art boom was started by 20 young proletarian artists , who call themselves " the Wedge . " The group is dedicated to teaching painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weasel . Formed six years ago-when most of its members were still art students-the Wedgies have inspired some 600 proselytes ( in &; out of jail ) . Bricklayers , factory workers and carpenters by day , Wedge members invade the prisons at night , with armloads of free paint and canvas . For their work in provincial jails and small villages , the art missionaries dip into the group kitty , which is replenished from their meager wages . <P> Wedge workers are aggressively nonpolitical . They think that Mexico 's Big Three ( Orozco , Siqueiros and Rivera ) put too much propaganda into their work . Art , according to the Wedge , should concern itself with " misery , mercy , and feelings coming out of people 's entrails . "
