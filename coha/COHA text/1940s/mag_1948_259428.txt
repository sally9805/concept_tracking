Is inflation ahead for the U.S. ? Or a price-lowering recession ? The Administration , along with many businessmen , could not agree on a forecast . Secretary of Commerce Charles Sawyer thought the danger was inflation . In a report to President Truman , Sawyer asked that the new Congress extend the waning life of all present business controls ( on exports &; imports , scarce metals , etc . ) . He clearly indicated that he would also like some potentially stiffer " standby " controls . <P> Secretary of the Treasury John Snyder disagreed . At a credit conference in Chicago , Snyder told 1,083 representatives of the American Bankers Association that " business apprehension , " which " is getting to be a seasonal affair , " had , in effect , already put a damper on overbuying , overborrowing , and overexpansion . There was no need for any additional broad controls against inflation . <P> This did not mean , he warned , that deflation was ahead . While admitting that the postwar backlog of demand for many items had just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steel products plus a demand for new products would probably take up the slack that was appearing . The economy , said he , showed " encouraging signs of stability in the vicinity of the present high levels . " <P> The bankers were not convinced , either by Snyder or by Sawyer . In a survey of 310 representative banks , A.B.A. had found that borrowers were becoming slower in their payments , working capital was being absorbed by rising inventories , and demand for loans was dropping . The bankers concluded that the U.S. " may be at an economic crossroads . A turn one way can mean a continued inflationary spiral , a turn the other way can bring a recession . "
