To support our contention that the issues of the impending election transcend normal party lines and traditional American groupings , we have asked five prominent individuals who might be expected to oppose the reelection of Franklin D. Roosevelt to state why they are in fact supporting him. - EDITORS THE NATION . JOHN CHAMBERLAIN Member of the Board of Editors of Fortune S 0 FAR as I can see I am a unique American : I face the political campaign with relative equanimity so far as domestic issues are concerned . If Wendell Willkie is victorious , I do not expect to see the social gains of the New Deal canceled ; at most they will be modified . Social security , soil conservation , the protection of minimum labor standards , and so on , all seem to me here to stay for a while . If Roosevelt wins , why so much the better on the domestic front for a majority of the population . But if Willkie wins , I do n't think the common man needs to head for the storm cellar . On foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This may seem odd for a so-called " isolationist , " for Willkie has been going about making a tacit appeal to keep-out-of-war sentiment . Maybe my fear calls for some explanation . For a year now I have been a member of the board that sponsors the mimeographed weekly Uncensored . Knowing that Uncensored is suspicious of our State Department , people are forever asking me how I can be both for Roosevelt and for an " isolationist " attitude toward Europe and Asia . This " either-or " demand gives me an acute pain . My " isolationism , " if any , is neither pacifist nor Communist nor Socialist anti-war policy , nor is it Middle Western inability to realize that the world is round and finite . I base my view on the realistic observation that " collective security " in international affairs has never worked , for reasons which Alexander Hamilton made plain long ago in the Federalist . If anyone cares to look into several book columns which I wrote for the New York Times in 1934 and 1935 he will see that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail , that " sanctions " would fail , that Europe was in for it , and that we would be forced to fall back on the luck of our geographical position and the strength of our own right arm . An old-fashioned alliance with England and France to hold the Germans down might have worked , but by 1935 it was too late to reverse the trend of a decade . As for the Stimson doctrine in Asia , it was Quixotic moralism ; we had thrown away the ships necessary to restrain Japan at the Washington conference in 1921-22 . With the expectation that the Versailles system would crumble , my feeling was then , as it is now , that the best we could do was to batten down our hatches and make the best of it . Strategically , with the oceans on our flanks , we had a chance of surviving as a democracy even with the entire outer world committed to a different system . The confusions and divided counsels that reigned in England , in France , in the China of Chiang Kai-shek 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other democratic countries right up to 1938 made it impossible for us to take the lead in forcing the world to conform to our pattern  --  assuming that we had a pattern for export  --  and we had no navy or military force capable of telling the " have-not " powers where to get off in their own particular spheres . To pretend that we had , as Roosevelt sometimes seemed to be doing prior to last May , seemed to me dangerous illusion . To help prevent any revival of that illusion I remain a sponsor of Uncensored , which , for all its mistakes , is a valuable watchdog . It is my guess , however , that the watchdog is merely a bit of extra insurance . The logic of events has forced the Roosevelt government back to my original position ? defend the Western Hemisphere ! If Germany is having such difficulty crossing Dover Strait , which is hardly wider than Long Island Sound , I do n't see how Hitler and Mussolini and/or Japan are going to bother us in our hemisphere provided we take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases between now and next spring . Conversely , I do n't see how we are to land an expeditionary force in Europe or in Asia . The fact of the matter is that the so-called " interventionists " among us have no freedom of maneuver ; they , like the " isolationists , " are limited by the facts of geography to measures calculated to bolster the ability of the United States to preserve freedom for itself . The point I am working up to is this : that to defend ourselves in our own hemisphere almost anything goes at this stage of the game . Since the Germans are in France and the Japanese are in Indo-China , we are deprived of the opportunity to thrust an unready army into dangerously exposed salients . It was in the cards from the beginning that we should be deprived of that opportunity . But we need not fear " angering " Hitler or Mussolini or Japan , for even if they win in Europe and in387 Asia I do n't think they can touch us , once our factories and shipyards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises to give us more time to arm , as it patently does , then I am all for that aid  --  although I think it wise to get a quid pro quo whenever possible , as in the destroyer deal . If it is possible to bluff Japan out of descending on the Dutch East Indies pronto , then I am for that bluff . The more we can confuse the Axis powers the better for the impregnability of our own isolationist position in 1941 . If we choose to threaten and bully Hitler , it can only help us to get the better of him if we have eventually to trade with a Fascist Europe later on . Hitler understands bullying ; he does n't understand " neutrality . " Implicit in my argument is the need for arming without delay to take advantage of our fine strategic position . And this brings me back to Wendell Willkie . Regardless of Willkie 's personal ability , which may be considerable , the Republican candidate is , after all , the leader of a party that is doing its level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have before me the copy of an advertisement of the First National Bank of Englewood , Chicago , which appeared in the Chicago Tribune for October 10 . The advertisement reads : " In a last stand for democracy , every director and officer of the bank will cast his vote for Wendell Willkie . " The attitude that lies behind those words seems to me ominous , divisive , and dangerous ; it is the attitude of men of little faith . If we are to read between the lines , it seems to me that the officers of the First National Bank of Englewood are trying to tell us that democracy can only be trusted when the " best people " are in office . That was the theory of Stanley Baldwin and of the French rightist governments ? and as a theory it has proved 100 per cent wrong . Democracy , in fact , is safe only when it is in the hands of people who are absolutely certain that it is the way of the future for their country come hell or high water ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am sure that Willkie is a genuine democrat , with a small d . But I think his party would antagonize the very people who must be counted on to arm us and , if necessary , to fight for us . It is as simple as that . Accordingly , I intend to vote for Roosevelt . JOHN G. WINANT Fortier Republican Governor of New Hampshire IN 1935 I FELT that peace was the prime issue before the peoples of the world For this reason I went to work with the International Labor Office in Geneva . I returned for a brief period to help organize social security in this country because I believed that if democracy in the United States was to continue to function it must rest on a fairer social base . These five years have convinced me that neither peace nor political democracy has been sufficiently identified with the welfare of the common man . The great contribution of the Roosevelt Administra- 388 .. . tion , in my opinion , has been its conception of democracy not as something static but as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic benefits of society to a larger section of the entire people under a wider measure of popular control . Two factors which have marked the change have been the annihilation of time as it relates to distance , whether in communication or transportation , and the extension of common-school education to the masses . The first has greatly complicated international relationships ; and the second has not kept pace in all countries with the mechanization which has tended to centralize authority without always protecting individual rights . The long years of depression and unemployment , in connection with an intensified nationalism which blocked goods and men from crossing frontiers , forced governments into experimentation in order to maintain political control . This has been a universal experience . The result has been constructive in some countries , in others detrimental , depending upon the objectives and methods and procedures employed . In the dictatorships the rights of the people have been subverted . In the remaining democracies the fundamental rights of free speech , free press , assembly , freedom of worship , and habeas corpus and trial by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare have been extended . It is well to remember that in Germany and in Italy the dictators came to power through an attack on communism which was financed by reactionary groups , while in Great Britain and the United States the central drive has been to protect the individual through progressive reforms and to give to him an increasing participation in the enactment of those reforms . To defend democracy is not warmongering . The condemnation of brutality , treachery , and aggression and the support of humanitarian action , fair play , and a good-neighbor policy are welcomed by free men of courage everywhere . I agreed with President Roosevelt when he told the world after Munich : There can be no peace if the reign of law is to be replaced by a recurrent sanctification of sheer force . There can be no peace if national policy adopts as a deliberate instrument the threat of war . There can be no peace if national policy adopts as a deliberate instrument the dispersion all over the world of millions of helpless and persecuted wanderers with no place to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women are not free to think their own thoughts , to express their own feelings , to worship God . I have talked with representatives of the organized workers in all the democratic countries of the world as well as with representatives of social and civic groups . I know of no other man who has the trust of the common people of those countries as President Roosevelt has . I know of no one else who can so inspire their faith and The NATION confidence . This is in part the result of circumstances ; in large measure , however , it is the result of the dynamic force and vital sympathy of a courageous character . In meeting the problems of these troubled times , in sustaining the hope and courage of the peoples of the democratic countries , and eventually in bringing support for a just and lasting peace , this influence is essential . It is an asset that can not be transferred . Over a period of years , with infinite tact and patience and good-will , our " good neighbor " relations with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recently , through the Act of Havana , been strengthened in a pact for hemisphere defense . We need to continue in office the men who are responsible for a friendly South American policy . The frontiers of democracy are receding . The friendly European countries that faced us on the Atlantic , sharing our common ideals of free government , have for the most part been overrun by totalitarian despotism . Great Britain , by its gallant struggle , still keeps its fleet between our shores and those powers that today offer stark threat against the principles by which free men live . Even if there were no ties of blood or common heritage of democratic faith and ways of life , enlightened self-interest , in my opinion , dictates the policy of " all aid to England short of war . " In the life-and-death struggle taking place across the sea , time is of the essence . Even a temporary interruption through change of government might have fateful results , not only to Great Britain but to ourselves . Skill and experience in business are very real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital . I do not believe that Franklin Roosevelt wanted to succeed himself . I believe he is again a candidate through force of circumstance . I believe his leadership is needed today in this period of tragic struggle in support of democracy and in defense of our homeland . VAN WYCK BROOKS Literary Historian and Socialist ALTHOUGH I AM a Socialist I am voting for President Roosevelt this year because I do not feel that Norman Thomas is realistic regarding the present world crisis . I do not see how we can hope to keep our democracy alive unless we are prepared to defend it strongly ; and it seems to me that never before have we needed so much Jefferson 's idea of a universal citizen army . With a powerful system of defense we may ward off war ; without it we shall invite war , and we should certainly lose that war . So I am also in favor of every possible aid to England . I admire the President 's foreign policy and wish to see it continued , and it seems to me that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance of our present Administration . October 26 , 1940 GIFFORD PINCHOT Former Republican Governor of Pennsylvania TWO LIFELONG DEMOCRATS ? one recently turned Republican -- are running for the Presidency . That is one reason why politics ought to play so small a part in deciding which of them to vote for . Vastly more important reasons are to be found in the situation of the country and the world , and in the training and experience of the two men . I disregard the third-term tradition : first , because it was never made for an emergency like this ; secondly , because the emergency is greater than the tradition ; and , thirdly , because when normal times come back , the American people can return to the tradition , as I have no doubt they will . I am and have long been for a single term of six years . In this crisis traditions and party politics alike are out of place . Local matters should give way to the safety of the nation . Just one question remains : One of two men will be our next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see our country through this dangerous time ? Look at them , and take your choice . One of them , Mr. Roosevelt , is beyond dispute the most widely experienced man in America in conducting the national government and in handling our foreign relations . The experience and training of the other , Mr. Willkie , in these two fields is exactly zero . He has had no experience whatever in government . He has , so far as I have been able to learn , never handled the affairs of a state , a city , a county , a township , or even a village . He simply has never learned how . But Mr. Willkie 's unfamiliarity with government at home , highly important as that is in a time like this , is as nothing compared to his complete lack of training and experience in handling our relations with other countries . That , to my mind , is the key to the whole matter . In this tremendous storm I can not vote to set at the head of this nation a man who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in charge of the ship in the worst hurricane that ever blew ? To my mind , the peace and security of our country come first . Compared with that , nothing else counts , and nothing else has a right to count . I am supporting Roosevelt because he offers the best chance we have for security and peace . I am for Roosevelt because he knows the ropes and because his foreign policy is sound and fine . I am against Willkie because he does not know the ropes , because he has no training for the job , because he is incompetent to handle it , and because the country would not be safe in his hands . I make no reference here to Mr. Willkie 's history as a utility lobbyist and magnate  --  matters which would bulk large with me in ordinary times . I do not discuss his fight on TVA or the methods his companies ern-389 ployed . I say nothing here about Mr. Willkie 's backers ? Wall Street , public utilities , concentrated wealth  --  or about his vague generalities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , sink into the background now . One question stands out . What is best for the United States ? Suppose you owned a farm . Would you hire a man to run it who had never plowed an acre or milked a cow ? I think not . I think you would look for a man who knew how . JAMES N. ROSENBERG Corporation Lawyer and Philanthropist WITH CARL SCHURZ and other refugees from the Germany of 1848 my grandfather came to find freedom in this country . He and my father were rock-ribbed Republicans . So was I for forty years . In 1928 and in 1932 I voted for Mr. Hoover , with whom I had long worked in the American Relief Administration . But in 1936 I gave up the Republicanism of all those years . It was not  --  it is not  --  easy for me . It meant breaking with a long past . It continues to be difficult . But the times call on us to lay aside every consideration but the crucial one  --  that of best safeguarding our liberties , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and admire about Wendell Willkie . In many respects he has shown himself forthright and clear  --  much clearer than many of his political bedfellows . He has done some fine things in this campaign . When he issued his stirring statement on civil liberties , when he spoke out vigorously in condemnation of bigots , I was happy to express publicly my admiration of his uncompromising and courageous stand . I rejoice in his frank recognition of the need for aid to Great Britain . But the gravity of the Presidential choice now before us transcends all these considerations . In every aspect of foreign policy President Roosevelt 's position seems to me to be sound and wise , and it is plain that the majority of his . party agree with that policy . I can not say the same for the Republicans ; the events of the past two months show that if Mr. Willkie is elected it does not at all follow that he will carry his party with him . I think we have , therefore , reason to fear that a Republican victory may mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations . Are we to forget that most of the Republicans in Congress opposed revision of the neutrality law and tried to prevent conscription , that it was Republican Senators and Representatives who fought President Roosevelt 's proposal for a 20 per cent navy increase in 1938 ? How can we dare place such a party in the saddle ? Can we turn over the reins of government to a driver who has supported conscription of men and opposed conscription of industry ? The ultimate issue is not of our choosing . It is the threat which Hitler , Stalin , Mussolini , and the war lords of Nippon have thrust at us . Against that threat Roosevelt 's superb leadership is dearly , in my opinion , our best assurance for the preservation of our democracy . When it comes to the domestic situation , I find that the Republican Party , which has for eight years  --  in season and out  --  assailed the Roosevelt program andpurposes , now gives them lip service in its platform . Though the details of administration of the Roosevelt program have left a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that I prefer to leave the improvement of administration of these enlightened laws to their friends , the Democrats , rather than to their foes , the Republicans .
