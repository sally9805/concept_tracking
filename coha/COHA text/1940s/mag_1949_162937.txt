On a bustling Nanking street , a newsboy said , " When headlines cry peace , it 's easy to sell papers . " Last week , the newsboy sold a lot of papers . A mounting clamor for peace with the Communists , at almost any price , was sweeping Nationalist China 's crumbling fronts . <P> Shanghai 's powerful city council-addressing the Communists as " gentlemen " instead of " bandits " - radioed its peace appeal direct to Red headquarters at Yenan . Peiping and Tientsin , completely isolated by Red armies , followed suit . The press burst out with reports that U.S. marines were leaving their base at Tsingtao ( where they had been training Chinese navy personnel ) . The report was quickly denied by Washington , but it was nonetheless true that plans had been made for their withdrawal . From all sides , pressure increased on Chiang Kai-shek to retire in favor of a Chinese leader more acceptable to the Communists . <P> Polite Insubordination . One of the most powerful advocates of peace now with the Reds was broad-shouldered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now Commander in Central China . He commands four Nationalist armies in the Hankow area , crucial for its position athwart the flow of food ( from the Hunan rice bowl ) and of munitions ( from Szechwan arsenals ) . <P> Last week , by what the Chinese press called polite insubordination , Pai rudely defied the Gimo . He ignored an order to send one of his armies to the Huai River front , where the Communists were attacking less than 100 miles north of Nanking . He even requested the return of two armies he had previously " lent " to Chiang . Rumors swept Nanking that crafty Pai was delaying river-borne supplies to the capital , that he was shifting troops southward to fortify his lao chia ( old home ) in Kwangsi . If true , it would be a severe blow to Nationalist hopes of holding the Yangtze . <P> In Nanking , meanwhile , amid vain attempts at secrecy , Foreign Minister Wu Te-chen conferred separately with the U.S. , British , French and Soviet ambassadors . His purpose was not made clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international mediation of the-civil war . <P> Rude Interruption . Disregarding the inevitable , the Nationalist government pushed ahead with plans for a last-ditch stand . All ordnance plants in the Shanghai-Nanking area , much light industry and operational headquarters of civil and military airlines were being moved to Taiwan and Canton . The Communications Ministry was shifting personnel and gear to Kiangsi , Hunan and Kwangtung . <P> The high-riding Reds seemed to have no thought of making peace except on their own terms . A three-day radio barrage hammered out an anti-Chiang theme built around oft-repeated symbols of " reactionaries , " " war criminals , " and " running dogs of American imperialism . " The big guns of Communist artillery then poured shells into Tientsin , North China 's leading industrial and commercial city , where a quarter of a million men had been conscripted to build defense works .
