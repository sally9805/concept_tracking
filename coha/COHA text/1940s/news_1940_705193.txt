txt AGENCY CURBS PUT UP TO ROOSEVELT BY HOUSE , 176 TO 51 Logan-Walter Bill 's Senate Amendments Are Accepted by Quick Procedure VETO CONSIDERED CERTAIN Lined Up With 113 Republicans Are 62 Democrats  --  Sumners Pleads for the Measure By TURNER CATLEDGE special to THE NEW YORK WASHINGTON , Dec. 2 ? The House today completed action on the Logan-Walter bill , subjecting rules and regulations of Federal regulatory and administrative agencies to judicial review , and sent it to the White House , where Administration leaders said it would encounter a veto . The measure ended its stormy legislative journey when the House adopted the Senate 's amendments by a roll-call of 176 to 51 . Sixtytwo Democrats joined with 113 Republicans and one Progressive in completing this setback to the New Deal so soon after the November elections . The Senate passed the measure last Tuesday by 27 to 25 , rolling over all efforts of Administration leaders to block it and save President Roosevelt the possible embarrassment over a 4lecision as to whether to approve or veto . House Proceedings Rushed The House 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan of those in charge of the bill to rush it through Congress and to the White House at the earliest possible moment . The usual procedure when the bill of one branch is amended by the other is for one to ask and the other agree to a conference , where differences may be ironed out in compromise . As soon as the House convened today , however , Representative Sumners , chairman of the Judiciary Committee , moved to concur in the Senate amendments . The first test , which came on a standing vote after Mr. Sumners had pleaded with the House to cast a vote for democracy by keeping the courts open to citizens , was 134 to 33 for concurrence . Representative Cochran of Missouri , opponent of the measure , immediately made a point of order that the vote , totaling 167 , did not represent a quorum of the House which , considering the two vacancies , was 217 members . Speaker Rayburn ordered a call of the roll to establish a quorum and vote upon the Senate amendments at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a total of ten more than a quorum . Sumners Argues for Bill Mr. Sumners argued that the bill was necessary to curb the " arbitrary power " of government agencies . He pointed to the growth of these agencies during the last few years and to their constant exercise of authority over the citizen , arguing that the time had come for Congress to correct its own errors when it failed in the first instance to standardize or regulate their procedure . " We have reached a place in dealing with these agencies where we have got to provide means whereby the citizen can have his grievances adjudicated by the courts , " Mr. Sumners said . " We have got to do this or abandon our system . " The veteran member told the House that it had been taking the easy way these last few years in adopting legislation . The very trend of government , of more and more // AGENCY CURBS PUT UP TO ROOSEVELT // centralization of power , wielded by administrative agencies under virtual blanket authority from Congress , was the easiest way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The easy way is the way down hill , " he remarked . " If democracy survives we have got to turn and go back up the hill . " Californian Opposes Bill Representative Thomas Ford of California countered with a warning that enactment of such a measure as the Logan-Walter bill would destroy the advances in social and economic reform made by the New Deal . He challenged supporters of the measure to be frank about their purpose . " When you deny the citizen the privilege of having his rights adjudicated in courts you destroy democracy itself , " Mr. Sumners retorted . Representative Cochran , who blocked unanimous consent to act upon the Senate amendments last week and thus put off action until today , denounced the bill for what he termed its " paralyzing provisions . " He argued that it would hamper the national *defense program by interfering with the work of agencies charged with conducting these preparations , adding that it might even interfere with the operations of the Selective Service law . " It wo n't hurt us to go along for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make its report on this very question , " he said . Mr. Cochran was referring to the independent committee of lawyers , headed by Dean Acheson , whom Attorney General Jackson has asked to make a study of the problem of procedure of governmental agencies which the bill sought to correct . This committee has not reported , and Administration leaders have argued from the start that action on the bill should wait its findings . Denies Interference With Defense Mr. Sumners disputed Mr. Cochran 's argument that the bill would interfere with national defense . Representative Rankin of Mississippi denounced the bill as proposing " the most dangerous concentration of power in the hands of the judiciary that has ever been proposed since I have been a member of this House . " " I shall vote against its passage and if the President vetoes it I shall take pleasure in helping to sustain his veto , " Mr. Rankin said . As sent to the White House , the Logan - Walter measure provides that administrative rules and all amendments to existing rules affecting persons of property shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after publication in the Federal Register and public hearings . Such rules must be published within ten days after issuance and can not become effective without such publication and opportunity for hearing of any interested person , unless in a public emergency . Court 's Jurisdiction Defined It provides , moreover , that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia shall have jurisdiction , upon petition filed by any person substantially interested in the effects of any administrative rule , within thirty days from the date on which any approved administrative rule is published , to hear and determine whether such rule , issued or continued in force , conflicts with the Constitution of the United States or the statute under which it was issued . No rule could be held invalid except for violation of the Constitution or conflict with the law , or for lack of authority conferred upon the agency in question . The measure then goes ahead to provide a system whereby a person aggrieved by a decision of any officer or employee of any agency may petition for a hearing of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts in case the decision of such board is not acceptable to either party to the issue . Findings Calling for Action The courts would be given authority to make a determination on the following findings : 1 . That the decision of the agency was not supported by findings of fact . 2 .
