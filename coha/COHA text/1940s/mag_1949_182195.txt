( See Cover ) <P> Most of the nation 's 3,000,000 golfers were in hibernation . Last week , except for a burst of New Year 's Eve celebrating , country clubs from Maine to Medicine Hat were silent and windswept , their fairways and greens deserted . One that was not lay in a small coastal canyon about a mile from the Pacific Ocean . Golf balls by the dozens whizzed down Riviera 's lush fairways ; crowds of gawkers hustled along among the eucalyptus trees ; caddies were busy as bird dogs . The $15,000 Los Angeles Open , which puts golf 's winter circuit in high gear , opens there this week . <P> Golf 's big names were there , straining to put a final touch of polish on their games . Ed Furgol , who manages to break par despite a withered left arm , had been drilling over the course for a month . Jimmy ( " Smiles " ) Demaret , the best wind-shot in the business , and slim Lloyd ( " Mustache " ) Mangrum haunted the practice rounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steely command of the emotions , it had taken hard work to get to the top of the tournament business and it was taking hard work to keep them there . With most of them golf was a matter of win-to-eat . <P> As the pros ( and a sprinkling of amateurs ) readied themselves for the big push , the man who held the top spot by virtue of his temperament , tireless diligence and many more qualities , was slim , wiry William Ben Hogan , 36 , of Fort Worth , the U.S. Open champion and one of the greatest tournament players in U.S. golf 's 54-year major-tournament history . <P> Some of Hogan 's fans call him " Blazin ' Ben , " but another nickname- " Little Ice Water " - fits even better . He stands 5 ft. 8 in. and weighs only 140 lbs. , but he manages consistently to hit one of the longest and straightest balls in golf . Apart from such purely technical skills , little Ben Hogan is the fiercest competitor in the game . With his relentless training schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social round of golf the most boring thing in the world . Any man who outscores the champ more than once this year will have to have most of the same qualities , because machine-like Golfer Hogan rarely has a bad day , rarely plays two bad holes in a row . <P> " Till Hell Wo n't Have It . " Hogan knows every foot of Riviera 's 7,000-yd. course . Two years running he has won the Los Angeles Open there . And there last June , leaving a hare &; hounds trail of half-smoked cigarettes in his wake , he won his greatest triumph thus far-the U.S. Open championship . He played Riviera as if he owned it ; the caddies called it Hogan 's Alley . <P> Hogan had no intention of relaxing on that account ; 1948 's laurels are no good in 1949 . He had n't played tournament golf for eleven weeks and he had some catching up to do . For an hour after he got to Riviera , he sprayed balls from the practice tee-first with the No. 9 iron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods . He considered the wind and terrain even in practice , controlled every shot as if the tournament had begun . He has a horror of what he calls the Sunday golfer 's gravest sin : " Just hitting the ball without thinking . " Like cigar-chomping Walter J. Travis , golf 's hero of half a century ago , Hogan likes to say that he never hits a careless shot .
