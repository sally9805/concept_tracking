The British had sworn to scorch the earth of Malaya , but the job was badly done . They scarcely singed the edges , left many a handsome prize for the oncoming Jap . U.S. Lieut . General Walter Krueger , commander of the Third Army , thought he could see the reason for the British failure : ignorance and insufficient explosives . He ordered an immediate training program to acquaint every combat unit under his command with the ins- &-outs; of demolition . <P> Last week , on the brush-covered , gully-cut hills of Camp Bullis , 20 miles northwest of San Antonio , Tex. , demolition experts previewed the program , found it good . Potential " students " and newshawks , advised to " look up and dodge " rather than seek cover , watched a picked demolition detail lop off a 17-in. tree with " a necklace of half-pound TNT blocks , open up a 4-ft. roadway crater , send barbed-wire entanglements up in a spray . Two TNT blocks neatly halved a railroad rail . A homemade mine ( an old cartridge box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6lb. of TNT ) tore the guns from an old World War I tank . A hand grenade and booby trap were manufactured on the spot from the same pick-up materials . <P> Walter Krueger 's plan will put 530 men from each Third Army division through a stiff ten-hour instruction course , bossed by Lieut . Colonel Merrow E. Sorley , onetime West Point teacher of engineering and military history . Lessons will be pounded home by instructors from the Corps of Engineers . Ultimate aim : to make the task of demolition , heretofore an art sacred to the engineers , a job that any soldier can do in a pinch , if he has the explosives and a bit of arson in his system .
