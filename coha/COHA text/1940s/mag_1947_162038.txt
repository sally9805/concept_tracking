New Orleans ( United Artists ) , which deals with early jazz , tries hard to give its subject the love and enthusiasm it deserves . In many respects , the movie does no more than clumsily suggest the fine picture that might be made about jazz . An elementary history of the cellar art , New Orleans barely hints at the fascinating redolence and toughness of New Orleans ' red-lighted Storyville , where jazz was born , and little of it is imaginatively filmed . <P> The plot : the king of Basin Street ( Arturo de Cordova ) is run out of town by the mother ( Irene Rich ) of a music-minded debutante ( Dorothy Patrick ) who likes him and the short-haired music played in Arturo 's basement by Louis Armstrong ( Louis Armstrong ) . Arturo and Louis move on to Chicago and finally to world success , which is excuse enough for everybody to kiss and make up . <P> Some of the people who worked on the film and acted in it plainly have a real feeling for jazz and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The genial touch of Elliott Paul ( see BOOKS ) is often clear in the script ; the Negro musicians-notably Armstrong , Singer Billie Holiday , Trombonist Kid Ory and Guitarist Bud Scott-act and play their music with freedom and pleasure . At the end , regrettably , jazz becomes " respectable " - probably the worst break it could get . <P> General audiences will be no more than mildly pleased with New Orleans ; even jazz lovers may be let down . But the film does give Louis Armstrong a chance to reproduce some of his best numbers . <P> Moss Rose ( 20th Century-Fox ) is used in this thriller as a murderer 's signature . Every time sinister-looking Victor Mature moves on to a new sweetheart , the flower is found on an open Bible beside the corpse of the girl he has just left . Peggy Cummins , a cockney showgirl who wants to be a lady , blackmails Mature into taking her for a visit to his elegant country mansion . There she hobnobs uneasily with his jealous fiance ( Patricia Medina ) and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to play detective , and falls in love with her main suspect . Next thing she knows , she is in line for the Bible , the moss rose , and the hair's-breadth intervention of Scotland Yard ( Vincent Price ) . <P> After the first few reels , Moss Rose is not very mysterious , but it is sometimes exciting , even when it does n't puzzle . Miss Cummins , a luscious little blonde , proves in this film that she certainly has a future in movies , whether she ever becomes much of an actress or not . Mature , who is generally effective in inverse ratio to the amount he talks , has little to say ; he has the advantage of being under suspicion and looks like a million dollars in counterfeit money . Miss Barrymore , trapped in foolish lines and a none-too rewarding role , appears often to be debating whether to kid the daylights out of her job or to throw it , with a queenly yawn , at Director Gregory Ratoff 's head . But the habits of a lifetime prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she gets off some first-rate croaks and eyeflashes.
