They carry out hush-hush Government missions and make big money as writers and artists . They drink lots of highballs , chain-smoke , worry about themselves and talk to each other in subtle banalities to cover their emotional high tension . They love with anxious violence-usually two people at the same time , until the last chapter . And mostly they are terribly good , terribly sensitive but terribly confused . <P> Elizabeth Janeway , whose first novel , The Walsh Girls , was a best-seller in 1943 , has made Daisy Kenyan out of these fascinatingly unhappy people and their jittery world of New York , Washington , Connecticut , and Nantucket . At 32 , Daisy is a beautiful , successful , emancipated magazine illustrator . For eight years her lover has been shrewd , rugged Dan O'Mara . Then she meets and marries high-strung magazine editor Peter Lapham . <P> But there is still something between Daisy and Dan : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very thin and clear and strong .
