Loafers in San Francisco 's Civic Center Plaza , idly feeding crumbs to the pigeons , suddenly found three circus elephants in their midst . With equal suddenness , in the midst of the elephants , appeared sober , chunky Roger Dearborn Lapham , the onetime shipowner who is now San Francisco 's bustling new mayor . Mounting a soapbox , able Mayor Lapham gave the pigeon feeders an impromptu 15-minute lecture on the merits of unifying the city 's traction system . Pointing to the elephants , he cried : " There stands an early outmoded form of transportation the likes of which we intend to get rid of in this town . " <P> This was only one of Roger Lapham 's efforts to get San Francisco voters to approve the city 's purchase of the ancient Market Street Railway , which for long years has run outmoded cars up &; down Market Street , competing against municipally owned cars . The four sets of tracks gave San Francisco a famed traffic hazard . But four times the voters had turned down the purchase proposal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one nonpartisan term in office , made 70 speeches in three weeks . On a newsman 's suggestion , he began calling up housewives at random , explaining the proposal to them in five-minute chats . On the Saturday before election he drove an old-fashioned horsecar , drawn by two white horses , for a two-mile trip along Market Street . The car was followed by a modern bus from which a loudspeaker blared : " I 've been waiting for a streetcar all the livelong day . " <P> Last week Roger Lapham had his well-earned triumph . The voters approved purchase of the Market Street system by a 22,000 majority ( last year they turned it down by 34,000 votes ) . The city will pay $7,500,000 for the private line , and operate it without change until the purchase price is paid out of revenue . Then it will be time to talk about junking the old cars , ripping up the extra tracks on Market Street . <P> The scoffers , changing their tune , began to speculate on Roger Lapham as a successor to aged ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been absent from the Senate most of the time in the last three years .
