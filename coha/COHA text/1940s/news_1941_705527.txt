He was 92 years old . With Mr. Heckscher at the time were his wife , Mrs. Virginia Curtiss Heckscher , and Robert Moore , manager of the Heckscher proper-1 ties in Florida . The aged philanthropist arrived here on Dec. 20 for his annual Winter visit . Despite ' his advanced age , he took an ac-1 tive interest in the management of a 2,500-acre citrus grove which he owned near here . Besides his wife he is survived by a son , G. Maurice Heckscher of New York , and a daughter , Lady Antoinette Esher , who is in England . Funeral arrangements had not been made tonight . It was expected that Mr. Heckscher 's body would arrive in New York on Tuesday . Mr. Heckscher 's New York home was at 52 Vanderbilt Avenue . Father a Statesman of Germany A common impression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this country a friendless immigrant boy of 19 with little education and less money . Almost the reverse is true . His father was a statesman and diplomat in Germany and the son came here under the protection of a wealthy branch of his family , members of which owned about 20 , - 000 acres of anthracite lands in Schuylkill County , Pa . He was born in Hamburg on Aug. 27 , 1848 , while his father Johann Gustav Wilhelm Moritz Heckscher , was Minister of Justice in the provisional German Government headed by Archduke John of Austria . As he was to say later , he " never knew his father very well and was a little afraid of him . " One day when he was 14 years old his father asked him what he wanted to do when he grew up . He said that he wanted to be a merchant , but could n't give a good definition of what a merchant is . His father told him he was a fool , but said that if he wanted to be a merchant he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was immediately changed  --  his father had intended him for the law  --  and he was sent to school in Switzerland . Then he was brought back and apprenticed for three years to an exporting house in Hamburg . He worked hard and learned about foreign exchange , ships and snipping , trade customs , the value of foreign money , the values of a wide variety of goods and commodities . He learned , too , that although imagination plays a very large part in business it can not be used in surveying accounts and that a sale must result in either a profit or a loss . He decided that the big thing in business is to know a profit when you see it , to know a loss when you see it , and to act accordingly . With these principles firmly fixed in his mind he decided to put them into practice here . His parents did not favor this move but , after some persuasion , his mother gave him $500 in gold in a money belt and he took passage for New York . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room in lower Fifth Avenue and set about learning Eng lish . A tutor , he decided , would be both expensive and slow . He joined the Mercantile Library on Astoz Place and for twelve or fifteen hours a day read English books . After three weeks he could read almost everything without the aid of a dictionary . He then began to make acquaintances and perfected his pronunciation by practice . In three months he had an extensive English vocabulary , could write the language readily and spoke with remarkably little accent . It was time then to call on his cousin , Richard Heckscher , who , with his uncle , Charles A. Heckscher , and other members of the family , owned the Pennsylvania coal lands . He joined his cousin in the management of a mine near Shenandoah , Pa . All he knew of coal was that it was black , but two weeks after he reached the mine his cousin became ill and he took over the management . He had all the accounting and general business sense needed , he found , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a human factor involved that was very important , for those were the days of the Molly Maguires . That secret organization of mine workers terrorized the entire region . Murder was common and convictions were difficult to obtain . The Heckscher mine owners managed to avoid serious trouble , but this was not easy to do . After fifteen years the mine was sold to a railroad and August Heckscher bought a large share in a zinc works at South Bethlehem with his share of the money paid for the mine . The company staggered under competition with the powerful New Jersey Zinc Company and in an attempt to even the competition the Bethlehem company bought land in Sussex County , N. J. , near that of the larger company . It opened up a mine and found the richest of all zinc deposits in the country . A great lawsuit started at once . Zinc Mine Contested in Courts . Powerful financial interests questioned his title to the zinc mines and fought for ten years for possession . The records of this case , famous . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from court to court and finally the New Jersey Court of Appeals ruled against the Heckscher interests . Keeping eleven lawyers busy and working constantly himself , Mr. Heckscher ransacked this country and Europe for facts , exhibits , testimony . The result of his long fight was that the Court of Appeals reversed itself , admitting that its earlier decision had been based on insufficient data . Meanwhile , however , all of Mr. Heckscher 's money was lost to him , in part through the failure of the financial institution where his funds were kept . He went to bed one night a moderately wealthy man and woke to find himself far in debt . A friend made him a loan of $50,000 to meet his more pressing obligations and he went on . His zinc company was merged with that of the New Jersey company in 1897 and he was manager of the company until 1905 when he resigned . He told friends of an intention to retire . He had all the money he ever would need and he was 57 years old . But developments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had bought the Whitney property at Fifty-seventh Street and Fifth Avenue . It did not pay . - He wondered why and started to find out . The answer seemed to be that this property was too far north for property development at that time . He put up a taxpayer on the site and started to accumulate land and buildings in the neighborhood of Forty-second Street . One property alone , the Manhattan Hotel , once in Madison Avenue between Forty-second and Forty-third Streets , he held for six years and sold for $3,000,000 more than he paid . Became Interested in S. P. C. 0 . One day Rudolph Degener , an officer of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children , tried to persuade Mr. Heckscher to give $6,000 to buy the society a motor bus . Mr. Heckscher said he would n't give any money for an automobile , but that he did have some land that " might be of some use to you . " The land was a block frontage on Fifth Avenue , between 104th and 105th Streets . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the society had n't enough money to put a proper building on the land , Mr. Heckscher decided that he had better give a building , too . The Heckscher Foundation Building was the result , the largest single gift made for the benefit of children in this city . And it was this that led to his interest in slum conditions , to his fight to end slums . The first contact was not pleasant . " The building itself , " he said later , " could not be badly hurt . It was solid stone and steel . But our walls , floors and ceilings , plumbing fixtures , storm water pipes , everything that was movable or capable of injury or clogging , was attacked and was marred from every angle of ingenuity and resentment . " He decided that the children " just did n't understand " and started a campaign of persevering kindness and patience that finally won the neighborhood over to an appreciation and use of what he offered . His philanthropic work continued and expanded , spread out into camps and parks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with New York 's slums . Meanwhile he was in some personal difficulties . His first wife , who had been Miss Anna P. Atkins , daughter of a pioneer ironmaster of Pottsville , Pa. , died , and his son , Maurice Heckscher , lost heavily in the Florida land boom and was declared bankrupt . Doctors warned him to beware of heart disease ; gout and rheumatism troubled him , and he developed a rather violent technic for self-cure and care . The technio consisted largely of thumping himself vigorously , pounding his head and chest and the heavy muscles of his legs and arms . He ate lightly and swam every morning in Long Island Sound and alternated between hot and cold shower baths . He also lessened his use of alcohol and drank a great deal of water . The cure , for him , proved effective and h4 was in excellent health and very vigorous all the rest of his life . Fanny Hurst Gave Parties Annually during the last several years of his life Miss Fanny Hurst , novelist and playwright , gave a birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer , who died on Dec. 26 . Mr. Heckscher always wrote a " poem " for these occasions , which for several years were held in restaurants . The last three were at Miss Hurst 's apartment . They were attended by close friends of the two aged men . For one of these occasions Mr. Heckscher wrote the following verse : WE WO N'T GO HOME ' TIL MORNING Feasting like the Dickens ( but he is n't here ) I propose we first dispose of all the liquid cheer . Birthdays are so common now that soon some younger nations By some deal compelled to work , will bring in poor relations . Let us then be up and doing while the sun still shines ; Fanny Hurst , who has a thirst , will no one feast who whines ; Frohman means a roving blade who never seeks the shade , Heckscher does n't mean a thing , of chestnuts let him sing . That was typical , although some , of similar poetic perfection , were on more serious subjects .

He also directed several personally owned or controlled corporations , mainly dealing in real estate , of which he had been a director for more than twenty years . He also was chairman of the board of directors of the Heckscher Foundation for Children . Each Winter he went to his home in Mountain Lake , a development near Lake Wales , Fla. , where he owned his own large home . In 1927 , three years after the death of his first wife , Frieda Hempel , German operatic soprano , brought suit against him in the Supreme Court for an amount reported to be $1,000,000 for alleged failure to abide by a contract to pay her $48,000 annually while she lived . The suit was settled out of court , but in November , 1936 , the Appellate Division ordered Mr. Heckscher to continue paying her $15,000 yearly , refusing his charge that he had been made a victim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 81 , he married Mrs. Virginia Henry Curtiss , the widow of Edwin Burr Curtiss , former president of A.
