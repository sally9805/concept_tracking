At 11:50 one morning during Holy Week the air-raid siren in Emporia , Kans. blared . A customer in Granger 's Ready-to-Wear store said , " Oh , that prayer whistle " ; a clerk clasped an Easter bonnet like a prayer book , bowed her head . Outside , car drivers pulled over to the curb . In a nearby pool hall the click of billiard balls stopped as the players stood self-consciously silent . <P> All during Lent , urged on by the town 's 30 churches ( membership : 6,500 ) , Emporia 's wartime siren had called townsmen to a daily " Sweet Minute of Prayer " for " a just and lasting peace . " At first , the siren had been heeded chiefly by school children . But last week , as the climax of Lent coincided with swiftly climaxing news from Europe , a big proportion of Emporia 's 13,188 citizens had acquired the habit of pausing each morning to pray . Emporia 's churches hoped they could keep the practice going until V-E day. + <P> + For news of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
