txt CITY URGED TO END ' FREE SUBWAY RIDE ' State Chamber , Budget Group Ask 100 Fare ? $76,000,000 Yearly Seen Given Away Declaring that New York City was giving away $76,000,000 each year in " free subway rides " because the 5-cent fare was insufficient to meet operating expenses , the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York called upon the city administration yesterday to establish a 10-cent fare without delay . At the same time William Church Osborn , president of the Citizens Budget Commission , informed Mayor O'Dwyer that pay cuts and payless furloughs were ahead for city employes if/the city did not balance its budget . Mr. Osborn said most of the city 's fiscal= troubles could be solved by adoption of the , 10-cent fare and asked that the fare be increased , now . The State Chamber 's Commit . tees on taxation and public service drew up a joint report on the city 's finances , which will be offered for approval at a general membership meeting on Thursday . The report taxed the city with preferring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than raise the subway fare to meet $75,500 , - 000 of its prospective $80,000,000 budget deficit . Cost Rise Since 1904 Noted " The nickel fare originated in 1904 , when the city 's general cost of living was comparably low ; " the report said . " Now the cost of living is two to three times higher . The general level of industrial wages has more than trebled , and in certain cases , such as the building trades , has more than quadrupled . But a ride on the subway still costs only a nickel . " The cost of running the subways has increased even more than the general cost of living . For many years each subv-ay ride for which the rider pays 5 cents has actually cost 7 cents or more , with the city absorbing the differential . In effect the city is paying each rider 2 cents for the privilege of having furnished him with a ride . As a result of . the sizable increases in wages granted operating personnel this year and the anticipated decline in passenger traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride is expected to reach 9 cents . " Why should n't users ' of the subways , like users of dther transit facilities , pay their way ? New York City 's subways are the only transit facilities in the nation whose users are able to enjoy free rides . " For every dollar of non-selfsustaining subway debt , the city must pay $2.27 in principal and interest . Because of the rigid constitutional limit on the size of the city 's debt , the less debt can be incurred for other purposes . If subway users paid their way , the city would have available some $425,000,000 of additional borrowing power for other purposes . " Instead of facing facts , the chamber said , the city administration was relying once more on Albany to help it out of its financial troubles . The chamber said this hope took two forms , one , that the State would grant additional aisl , and second , that the State would authorize the city to levy additional local taxes . Recalling the series of special relief taxes authorized in 1936 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the proceeds going to a wide variety of city functions . At present , it added , the taxes seemed to be used to meet the subway deficit . Budget Commission Letter In a letter to Mayor O'Dwyer , the Citizens Budget Commission said the city must rectify its financial situation now or meet a crisis more severe than the last one that brought pay cuts and payless furlougha to city employes . " The city has been spending far beyond its resources , " the letter said . " It is borrowing against future budgets . New and special taxes were necessary to meet the $101,600,000 increases made only last spring in the current budget . At present the city appears to have no definite plan for financing a proposed further increase of $105,600,000 in the new 1947-48 budget . " The city 's main financial troubles will be solved by a 10-cent subway fare . We believe that there can not be full subway rehabilitation , nor a program of needed schools , hospitals and other current public improvements until the transit system is made to pay its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The commission said the city could save money by reclassifying its civil service , a job that has not been done in forty years . Hyman Blumberg , State chairman of the American Labor party , criticized Governor Dewey last night for his budget message , saying it used " political arithmetic to produce a minus sign for the people . " He said the State should contribute more financial aid to its communities , especially in education and child welfare .
