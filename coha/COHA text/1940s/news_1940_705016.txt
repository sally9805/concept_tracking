txt One of the largest forces of British bombers thus far used in the war , this morning and last night further hampered any German preparations for sending land troops against Great Britain 's gates . Royal Air Force defenders carried out two big jobs to prevent their enemy from advancing the front line in the Battle of Britain . Both jobs were done with success , according to the Air Ministry . In one phase of the night 's operations , British fliers said they challenged the potential German " invasion spearhead " ? French , Belgian and Netherland coastal points where long-range gun sites , shipping , barges , docks and harbors were heavily bombed . While this destruction was going on , other R. A. F. forces flew to the northeast and tore holes in Hamburg on the Germans ' " right wing , " then penetrated behind their lines to deliver blows once more at Nazi support points , such as strategic railroad yards and distribution centers , London was told . Mine Fields Laid Meanwhile it was learned for the first time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellor Hitler 's invasion ports recently by British planes , the pilots of which have flown through every sort of , weather to perform their task . These mine fields stretch all the way from the Bay of Biscay north to the Norwegian coast . Besides long-range gun emplacements at Cap Gris Nez and shipping at Hamburg , the Air Ministry said , places along the German front line attacked during the night included the following : Cherbourg , where at least two supply ships were sunk and many fires started ; Ijmuiden , Ostend , Zeebrugge , Antwerp , Terneuzen , Flushing , Dunkerque , Calais and Boulogne . Strategic points behind the line which R. A. F. bombers visited were Krefeld , Hamm , Ehrang , Osnabrueck , Soest , Stotzheim near Cologne and Brussels . Although the raids were made on an unusually big scale and in the face of heavy opposition in some places , only two British planes failed to return home , the Air Ministry announced . So far as could be ascertained , Berlin was not bombed during the night . Calais Special Target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night was Calais . Smashing at this once friendly but new hostile port , British airmen started fires on the west side of the Carnot basin and estimated the flames to stretch for a quarter of a mile , accompanied by lesser blazes near the southwest corner of the west basin and along near-by railroad lines . Later waves of R. A. F. bombers dropped explosives on the east side of the Carnot basin , causing what they reported as " an immediate explosion followed by about sixty others . " One string of bombs fell across the tidal lock , leaving a trail of flame , it was added . In peacetime when tourist trains chuffed to Paris from the Gare Maritime they used to skirt the Carnot basin , leaving it on the right before entering Calais Ville Station , where the west basin joins the tidal harbor on the side opposite the Gare Maritime , which is on the right as seen from cross Channel boats . It was formerly cut off by lock gates , which now are said to present a bad scene of destruction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ministry reports . There incendiary bombs started " great fires " and piers and vessels lying in the Scheldt were repeatedly hit . While anti-aircraft guns thundered below them , bomber after bomber darted down through the clouds , boldly releasing their messages of destruction , and then streaked up through a protective cloud , which enabled them to get away , the description given here said . Over Flushing one flier dropped what is known in R. A. F. parlance // INVASION BASES HIT IN BIG R. A. F. RAIDS // as a " stick " of explosive bombs , and when he came home told his intelligence officer he could not spot them bursting , but did see clusters of barges break up and scatter , altering their original formation . The Air Ministry said Boulogne had another big attack and soon after midnight one raiding party flying through broken clouds enjoyed a " particularly successful " trip . This particular section of raiders released what the Air Ministry reticently described as a " quantity " of bombs which burst among barges , . other craft and harbor buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen twenty miles at sea . At Ostend about thirty sluggish barges  --  surface vessels that are not innocent sand or gravel carriers but troop transports it is believed ? were bombed . Also , the Air Ministry declared , the outer and inner harbors , the main docks and the south side of the Bassin d'Eschouage all were hit . Big gun nests were heavily attacked during the brilliant moonlight and many pilots , the Air Ministry asserted , " saw bombs expk , ding well within the target area . " During a recent aerial bombardment of Cherbourg , the exact date of which was not given , the Air Ministry said two ships , one believed to be a destroyer , were blown up . Struggling through a gale , three R. A. F. squadrons took part in that raid and when they finished dropping their loads they left a ring of flames around the harbor , it was added . One pilot describing the scene said : " It was a box barrage so thick it was like a firey carpet . " One vessel hit amidships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spout of water 200 feet high , the Ministry reported . The flight commander in charge of one raiding section related : " From 5,000 feet the dock area of Cherbourg looked like acres of Chinese gardens at night . Our bomb flashes twinkled in myriads . Concentrations of dazzling colored searchlights swirled around and from every angle came exploding shells so numerous they made a kind of crazy pavement across the sky . One fire below us resembled a crimson horseshoe and it seemed as if every yard of the central part of the docks was framed in fire . " Norwegians Get Ships Back LONDON , Sept. 18 ( UP ) ? Lashing gales , which were reported to have scattered Chancellor Hitler 's " invasion fleet , " gave way today to brilliant sunshine and moderate seas . As the " invasion weather " improved , however , information reached London that Herr Hitler has started to return to Norwegian ship owners hundreds of small ships that had been requisitioned for the launching of a large-scale invasion . The report was taken in some quarters to mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postponed or altered  --  perhaps because of the British air blows upon German bases or the rapidly changing weather over the Channel . The information came from a Norwegian just arrived in London by airplane from Stockholm . He said the Germans had requisitioned almost every seaworthy craft in Norway during the last two months and that after the seizures started there was a period of intensive preparation and training for an invasion of Britain . Even cavalry was sent to Norway to train in debarkation , the informant said . He described German cavalry horses swimming to shore from ships . Fishermen and other owners of vessels were astonished , the informant said , when last week German authorities began restoring their craft to them . The Air Ministry , in revealing that night after 1 ight the R. A. F. bomber command has been laying mines in German-occupied harbors and territorial waters , covering all possible " jumping-off points " for invasion , said the Germans were " unable to prevent the laying of mines even in strictly preserved and heavily defended waters . " It was said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed by the mines . Pilot Takes Revengo LONDON , Sept. 18 ( /13 )  - -  A British pilot who bombed Boulogne last night dove to 200 feet to make sure he had done his work well , Air Ministry sources said tonight . His London home had been demolished a few nights before by German bombers . The pilot reported with satisfaction that barges and other " invasion ships " were hit and that he could see the flames from them for twenty miles .
