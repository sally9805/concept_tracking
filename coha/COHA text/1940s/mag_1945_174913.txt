STEEL No , Thanks ! <P> Politely but firmly , U.S. Steel last week informed the Defense Plant Corp . that it would neither lease nor buy the Government-constructed $200 million Geneva steel works near Provo , Utah . Instead , Big Steel opened its campaign for the potentially lush Western market by earmarking $25 million for the expansion of its subsidiary , the Columbia Steel Co. , of Pittsburg , California . <P> This unexpected turndown left the Defense Plant Corp . with only two prospective tenants for Geneva-the Colorado Fuel &; Iron Corp . and a syndicate headed by Henry Kaiser , indefatigable champion of basic industry for the West . Neither has made a specific bid for Geneva . <P> In his letter of regret , U.S. Steel President Benjamin F. Fairless made it plain why Big Steel ' was abandoning the war baby it had built for the Government in 1941 . Prime reason was a provision in the Surplus Property Act which provides that Government metals plants costing more than $5,000,000 may not be lease ; ! for more than five years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease was not good enough for U.S. Steel for two reasons : 1 ) Geneva is still an unsettled financial property-to make Geneva a postwar moneymaker will take about $70 million 's worth of new-facilities ; 2 ) U.S. Steel is wary of professional Westerners and Congressional anti-monopolists , who feel that the Corporation is already too big and too powerful . <P> Steelman Fairless then made a counteroffer . U.S. Steel would be more than happy , he said , to buy a " substantial amount " of hot rolled coils from the future operators of Geneva , whoever they might be . " Such an arrangement , " said Fairless , " should contribute toward the successful operation of that plant . "
