txt DAMAGE $1,000,000 Freighter Panuco Pulled to Flats and Said to Be Total Loss NO SABOTAGE IS FOUND FBI , Army and Navy Join the Inquiry  --  Many Narrowly Escape Rush of Flames Fire that spread with phenomenal speed destroyed Pier 27 in Brooklyn yesterday and wrecked the New York &; Cuba Mail Line freighter Panuco , which was being unloaded alongside . Nineteen men were believed to have lost their lives . The bodies of three were recovered , and a fourth was seen on the deck of the Panuco after that vessel had been towed a mile offshore to burn out '  --  a process that may not be completed today . At least fifteen other men were declared by police to be missing , and thought to be lost . Seventy-two men were treated either at hospitals or at the seen : A large additional group , the exact number unknown , were treated at the scene for minor injuries that were not recorded , or escaped unscathed . Police calculated that at the time of the fire 140 longshoremen under ten bosses were working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the crew were aboard . The damage was in excess of $1,000,000 . Captain John J. , in charge of the Brooklyn homicide squad , who participated in an inquiry conducted on a nearby pier as the flames still were raging , said he was " reasonably sure that the fire was not caused by sabotage . " District Attorney William O'Dwyer of Brooklyn was understood to agree . Assistant District Attorney Edward.A . Heffernan expressed the view of the District Attorney 's office that there had been no sabotage . He also announced last night , after questioning of eighteen witnesses , that no evidence had been found to indicate criminal negligence . Nevertheless , the inquiry will be continued today . FBI Aids in Inquiry Participating in the investigation were representatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , the Army , the Navy , the Police Department and the Fire Department . Federal officials had quickly intervened in the inquiry because , the international situation being what it is , every major disaster nowadays arouses suspicion of subversive activities . If the suspicions of Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke , instead of a saboteur , who caused a fire that resulted in five alarms , requiring the movement of onefifth of the fire apparatus of the entire city . Not all of this apparatus was on duty at the pier ; some of it moved into sectors whose regular equipment was on active duty . The Navy was particularly interested because lighters waiting to load the Panuco , once its cargo had been removed , carried large quantities of stores , including engineering equipment , for the naval base at Guantanamo , Cuba . Some of this material was damaged . Flames Spread Rapidly Early in the fire there were numerous explosions , but all evidence is that there was no blast at the very beginning . From the firefighting point of view , the most remarkable thing about the blaze was the rapidity with which it spread . It was the fastest fire in the seventeen years of fire-fighting experience of Battalion Chief Fred Myer , whose station at 535 Hicks Street is two blocks away from Pier 27 , which is at Baltic Street , a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a box of matches and light it , " said Chief Myer . " That 's the way this fire spread . " Chief Myer said it was not more // FIVE ALARMS ON THE BROOKLYN WATERFRONT : AN AMERICAN FREIGHTER GOES UP IN FLAMES 19 BELIEVED DEAD AS PIER , SHIP BURN // than a minute after the first alarm sounded , at 11:44 A. M. , that he was at the scene . And already the entire pier , a structure ? 800 feet long and 150 feet wide , was in flames , as was the Panuco , which was moored to the north side of the center of the pier . From the stories of the survivors , investigating officials determined that the fire had started at the south side of the pier , near the point at which the structure joined the land . A workman in a crane , who was putting unloaded cargo into tiers on that side of the pier , told District Attorney O'Dwyer that he discovered a tiny flame near some piles of sisal , a fiber used in rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said that when he first saw the flame he thought it did n't amount to anything . He said : ' I could have easily put it out with a pail of water or with my windbreaker if I had had it with me . But the next instant fire was all over . It was wholly out of control in just a few seconds . ' " According to police and fire officials , the speed with which the flames spread could be explained by the type of merchandise stored on the pier . It included , they reported , a large consignment of oil in drums . a quantity of paint and paint thinner , and bales of sisal , a highly inflammable material . Workmen Cut Off by Fire Starting on the south side of the pier , the flames swept quickly across to the north side , thus cutting off escape for the trapped workmen . In only a few seconds the Panuco was blazing from stem to stern . Alongside her were several lighters , many of them loaded with drums of chemicals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tops of the drums were bursting upward . Some members of the crew and some of the longshoremen raced across these barges ahead of the fire . The barges were so close together that several men got to safety , leaping from one . to another , and on to the next pier to the north , a distance of at least 100 yards . Other men dived into the water . Some were lucky enough to make their way to shore without injury , but others were stifled by the flames and at least one man apparently died of a heart attack . The fire gave forth vast clouds of black smoke . Only a few minutes after it had got , under way , it no longer was possible to make out the Panuco from the shore . This smoke billowed about through the adjacent section of Brooklyn , and even as far as two miles away it darkened the sun . The hardest task facing the firefighters was to get the Panuco away from the pier . A fairly strong south wind was blowing , spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Panuco Pulled From Pier Eventually the firefighters succeeded in getting a line fixed to the Panuco . The tug Fred Dalzell took this line , and started to tow the ship from her berth . A companion tug , the William Dalzell , took place at the other end of the ship , nosed against her , and pushed . The city 's newest and biggest fire boat , the Fire came alongside the William Dalzell and kept water playing on her bow fender . Fire r ? 0440 ... ; 000744r14.01,4 - started there each time was water . At least three members of the Panuco crew clung to a line over the side of their ship during part of that blazing ride . They finally dropped free when they were clear of the fire area and were picked up . They suffered scorchings of the head and hands and considerable shock ? so much so that they scarcely could recount their experiences when they reached shore two hours later . But they will live . One of the known dead was the first officer , George C. Paterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn . His body was identified at the King 's County Morgue by his wife , Mrs. Christina Paterson . The master of the ship , Captain Henry H. Tevike , was not aboard at the time of the fire . Perhaps the most comprehensive account of the progress of the fire came from Joseph Budish. of 114 West Eighty-sixth Street , who is secretary of the Kay Manufacturing Corporation , distributors of bed springs . Mr. Budish 's office is directly across from Pier 27 . Intervening are only a couple of railroad tracks . " My windows were open , " Mr. Budish said , " and if there had been any kind of explosion at the beginning I could n't have missed hearing it . My first sight of the fire was when a tiny tongue of flame came through the door of the pier . About the same moment I saw it I saw a man come running out of the door . The bottoms of his trousers and his gloves were on fire . People on the pavement ran to him , put the flames out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was watching them the whole front of the pier turned into a sheet of flame . " Men in our factory , who knew many of the longshoremen , told me later that at least 1,000 barrels of oil were stored on the pier . They had heard about it from the survivors . It apparently was that oil that burned so quickly . It threw rockets of flame high into the air , like fireworks . " By the time the firemen got there  --  and they got there quickly ? it was already too late to control the flames . " Before we knew it , the windows in my office began to crack from the heat . We pulled the files away from the walls to get them away from the falling hot glass . " I was greatly impressed by the work of the firemen . One of the first things they did was to work hose lines to the roof of the pier to ' the north of Pier 27 . They were right out on the peak of that pier , heedless of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out those small fires they turned their hoses on Pier 27 . " Some of our men , who talked to longshoremen survivors , say that quite a few must have been trapped below . Two longshoremen tablished until men can be put aboard the Panuco . It was so hot in the vicinity of the grounded vessel last night that police launches could get no closer to her than 100 feet . Patrolman Earl Dumond , pilot of Police Launch No. 1 , whose boat got as close to the Panuco as it could , said that he saw one body on the after well deck . The freighter was so hot , he reported , that the plates were causing the water alongside to boil . She had listed almost 45 degrees . Battalion Chief Myer turned in the second , third , fourth and fifth alarms to call . an extraordinary amount of firefighting equipment to the scene . The second was at 11:50 , six minutes after the first . The others came at 11:51 , 11:52 and 11:53 . Pier 100 Yards Away Ignited " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Chief Myer . " The whole pier , from one end to the other , was in flames . The heat was so terrific that fire started in no time on the roof of another pier 100 yards away . " In Pier 27 there were explosions every few moments . They blew up through the top of the structure , and flaming oil went hundreds of feet into the air . " About ten minutes after I got here the whole top fell hi . I never saw a body of fire move so fast . " Alongside the pier was a small lunchroom ? Patsy 's Lunch . A flimsy structure of corrugated iron , it stood up under the flames in surprising fashion . After the fire had been brought under control there remained of the pier structure only the framework of the wall on the water end , but Patsy 's Lunch was almost intact . The wooden floor had been burned in spots , and water had caused damage , but that was all . Near the lunchroom two automobiles had been parked . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of them , belonging to Walter Edwards of 109-25 152d Street , Jamaica , Queens , was a strange sight . The glass of the windshield had melted and a huge glob of it had caught on the steering post , around which it had hardened . Emergency Unit Responds The fire provided the first duty call for the disaster emergency unit of the Kings County Hospital . Fifteen physicians and nurses of that unit arrived at the scene in four ambulances . They gave first aid to sufferers who later were dispatched to hospitals and fixed up the minor wounds of those who did not need hospitalization . In all , eleven ambulances were utilized at the fire , the other hospitals involved being the Long Island College , the Holy Family , the Cumberland , the Methodist , St. Peter 's and the Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn . Thirty persons , two of whom were reported in dangerous condition , were detained at the various hospitals . Thirty-nine were treated in hospitals and permitted to go to their homes . Fifty-seven pieces of fire-fighting equipment went directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shifted to other stations to replace those on active duty . This was necessary so no part of Brooklyn or Lower Manhattan might be without protection . Present were twenty-eight engine companies , six hook and ladder companies , one water tower , one boat tender , four fire boats , a fire rescue squad and a fire department ambulance . The police supplied five emergency , squads and five launches . Seven Firemen Hurt Only seven firemen were hurt , according to Dr. Harry M. Archer , Second Deputy Fire Commissioner . They suffered eye inflammation , caused by smoke . The fire was the most serious since the accession of Patrick Walsh to the Fire Commissionership . The Commissioner expressed himself as proud of the way in which his men handled the emergency . Similar praise came from Newbold Morris , Acting Mayor . Both Mr. Morris and the Fire Commissioner were at the scene ? the latter , wearing his helmet , taking active charge of the battle with the flames . Firemen reported that in addition to destroying Pier 27 and the Panuco , the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of damage to eighteen lighters . Officials of the New York and Cuba . Mail Line said the cargo of the Panuco was worth about $600 , - 000 , and they estimated the value of the ship at $500,000 . They expected the ship to be a complete loss . Officials of the New York Dock Company , owners of the pier , declined to estimate the amount of their loss . Of great assistance in directing the firemen particularly in the early part of the fire , was Police Airplane No. 1 , piloted by Jack Friedman with Patrolman Michael Fabian at the radio . Department officials ashore found it most difficult to determine where men and hoselines were needed , but from the plane it was possible to get an excellent view . The fliers radioed their observations to the ground and were responsible in good measure for the success of the firemen in preventing the flames from spreading from the pier and the Panuco . A rescue took place at 6:30 o'clock when a Coast Guard boat picked up seven men and took them to Ellis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work unloading the Panuco came from Louis Buckholtz , assistant pier superintendent for the New York &; Cuba Mail Line . He said he thought that most of the men had been on the so-called " upper tween deck " amid bales of as so bi aal , r d of which there were 2,400 aboard . According to Assistant Fire Chief John J. McCarthy , the ship had in its cargo , in addition to the sisal , large quantities of cotton , oil , tar products and metal cables . The owners of the ship reported that also aboard were arsenic , quicksilver , copper , goat skins , shark hides and miscellaneous vegetable products . Antonio Sonto , 34 , of 34 Cherry Street , Manhattan , ? boatswain 's mate , told police investigators that the first officer had ordered the crew to close the hatches at the first alarm of fire . They started to carry out the order , Sonto said , but found it impossible to do so because the flames progressed so quickly . Thereupon they went over the side . Panuco Arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that had been unloaded at Carney 's Point , N. J. She had arrived Sunday at Pier 27 , having touched at Guantanamo , and Havana , Cuba , and Tampico , Mexico , since she left New York July 17 . She was an oil burner long , and was built at Seattle in 1o9f137.,570 gross tons , was 351 feet Reports that shipments to Britain of war materials had been involved in the fire were denied by a spokesman for Funch-Edye , Inc. , 25 Broadway , a subsidiary of the Cunard Line that handles such outgoing supplies . The spokesman explained that Pier 26 , alongside the one that burned , is regularly used for such British shipments , but yesterday , he said , there was no cargo whatever on that pier , nor was any British material on Pier 27 . Coast Guard officials , who contributed two cutters and several smaller boats to the marine rescue armada , warned police not to send any men aboard the burned-out hulk unless they were equipped with gas masks . They said that chemicals in the cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died down . Ship Burning Late at Night At 9 o'clock last night Acting Deputy Fire Chief John J. Hurton radioed from the Fire Fighter that the Panuco still was burning from end to end . The Fire Fighter was alongside on watch . Chief Hurton said that the ship had settled in twenty-two feet of water on the Gowanus Flats , one mile offshore . It was impossible to board her at that time , he said , and indications were that it would be for some time to come . In Washington , Jesse Jones , Secretary of Commerce , appointed a board to make " an immediate and searching investigation " into the burning of the Panuco . He directed that the board meet today in New York . The members are J. Frank Staley of the Department of Justice , chairman ; Captain R. W. Dempwolf of the Coast Guard and Captain George Fried of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation .
