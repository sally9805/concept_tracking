Would its tough Argentine policy be a success ? The U.S. would get a quick answer at this Sunday 's election . If democratic candidate Jos P. Tamborini won , so had the U.S. If totalitarian Pern were elected President , it would take more than words to blast him out of Argentina 's Casa Rosada . <P> Campaign Finals . As time grew short , Pern quickened his already kinetic campaign . He harangued a Buenos Aires mass meeting which turned into a circus because tumultuous rain had shorted loudspeakers , evinced fear for his life ( " any move against my person will bring civil war in 48 hours " ) , barnstormed up &; down potent Buenos Aires province . <P> Pern tried to make capital out of the U.S. Blue Book charges ( TIME , Feb. 18 ) , called them undiplomatic , then himself screamed : " crude lies . " To a reporter he blandly declared : " If I 'm a fascist , you are Mary Pickford . " But the Strong Man 's attempt to make the election a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pern or Braden , that is the issue " ) , got a jolt when Harry Truman stated flatly that , as President , he stood behind every word in the Blue Book . <P> That Juan Domingo Pern and the Argentine Government favored the Nazis was hardly news . Outspoken old Cordell Hull had said that a year and a half ago . But the very bluntness of the U.S. Blue Book charge that Pern &; Co. had actually conspired with the Nazis , the chapter &; verse on names , places and methods profoundly shocked the Americas . Argentines seemed stunned . <P> The U.S. State Department had taken a chance in throwing its haymaker . Argentines , proud of their national dignity , might unite behind Peron as they had when Cordell Hull blasted away at him . That would mean victory for Peron in the forthcoming election . Other Latin nations might jib at lone-handed , stiff-necked U.S. action . But last week press and unofficial reaction throughout the hemisphere backed up the U.S. tough talk . If the Blue Book had not helped Argentina 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Hue &; Cry . There were dissenters . Many a thoughtful U.S. citizen asked what State Department policy was , anyhow . Why had Edward R. Stettinius Jr . and idealistic Nelson Rockefeller , presumably having much of the dope on the Argentines at the time , led the fight for Argentina 's admission to the UNO at San Francisco last April ? Others , including many a Latin , noted that the U.S. attack came at the climax of the Argentine presidential campaign , called it intervention . <P> Colts &; Mausers . Intervention or not , buoyant Jos Tamborini , full of vigor and confidence , took to the country at week 's end . He was off for Argentina 's far west and the Province of San Juan , where Pern supporters had split . Because their previous campaign train had been stoned and shot at , the Tamborini crowd now took pains to pack Colt .45s and palm-sized Mauser .25s ( the boudoir special ) . <P> This week Tamborini supporters taunted the Strong Man 's descamisados ( shirtless ones ) with a timely twist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Feb. 24 election date : " Domingo Spanish for Sunday will fall on the 24th.
