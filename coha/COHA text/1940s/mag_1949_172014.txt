The Window ( RKO Radio ) gives a modest but impressive view of how well Hollywood can do , if it tries , on a grade B budget ( under $750,000 ) . One of the last jobs done for RKO by Executive Producer Dore Schary before he joined MGM , it combines a neat story by Cornell Woolrich , competent playing by twelve-year-old Bobby Driscoll and four relatively unknown actors , and some expert camera work in the brownstone jungles of Manhattan 's East Side tenements . Smoothly mortised and joined by Director Ted Tetzlaff and Producer Frederic Ullman Jr. , The Window emerges as a fast little thriller full of grade A qualities . <P> The suspense begins to build up when Tommy ( Bobby Driscoll ) , a tenement kid with a habit of telling tall tales , sees a murder . When he tells his sober , hardworking parents ( Barbara Hale and Arthur Kennedy ) , they do not believe him ; neither do the police . But the murderers ( Paul Stewart and Ruth Roman ) get wind of Tommy 's knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film is a hair-raising chase by night which ends up in a fire-gutted tenement . As the camera stalks hunter &; hunted about the shadowy ruins , the suspense is drawn out to a fine edge . An intelligent sound track , all ears , brings it to a razor sharpness . When Bobby is finally cornered on a giant rafter , overhanging the gaping cellar , the rotted wood starts giving way . What follows is a breathless , well-executed collaboration between lens and microphone . <P> Director Tetzlaff has cannily short-circuited the improbabilities of the script by documentary-like handling of Bobby 's home and environment . Bobby , particularly in his moments of open-mouthed terror , is a reminder that child cinemactors can be used effectively for other things than wringing hearts and tears . <P> The Lady Gambles ( Paramount ) gets off to a shocking start with a handsomely photographed sequence showing Barbara Stanwyck taking a brutal beating in a murky underground passage . Barbara 's crap-shooting friends have just caught her with a pair of loaded dice . <P> Like the unfortunate hero in Dostoevsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person consumed by a hopeless passion for pitting the probable against the possible . Her downfall begins during a brief visit to Las Vegas , where she meets a suave professional gambler ( Stephen McNally ) and takes her first innocent fling at roulette . While her journalist husband ( Robert Preston ) is busy on an assignment , she takes a few more flings . By this time Barbara is a goner . Eventually she loses a wrestling match with her moral scruples , gambles away the family savings , and runs off in shame to join forces with Gambler McNally . <P> Lady pictures the how of a gambler 's obsession with a good deal of plausibility . Especially skillful are Barbara Stanwyck 's hard-breathing , glitter-eyed performance at the gaming tables , and Russell Metty 's feverish camera work in &; out of the neon-lighted dens of Las Vegas . The story gets added strength from Stephen McNally 's interpretation of a gambler who , for once , appears to be an intelligent character . <P> When it comes to the why of Barbara 's plight , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood efforts to pin Freudian labels on human weakness , this one clutters a fairly reasonable plot with murky gibberish.
