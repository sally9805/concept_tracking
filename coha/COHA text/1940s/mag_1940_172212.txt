In Europe 's bloody wars , for every ten men slain by the enemy , pestilence has killed its thousands . In the Thirty Years ' War , an estimated 8,000,000 Germans were wiped out by flea-borne bubonic plague and louse-borne typhus fever . On Napoleon 's retreat from Moscow , typhus , dysentery and pneumonia killed 450,000 of the Grand Army 's 500,000 men . <P> World War I was the first war in history in which guns were more deadly than germs . Battlefield deaths totaled 8,000,000 ; deaths from disease , 3,000,000 . Yet , despite the great achievements of medical science , disease was still a potent wartime killer . In 1914 , typhus swept through Serbia , spread to Russia , where , in four years , it killed 3,000,000 peasants . <P> Today British and French doctors expect no epidemics of typhus , typhoid or cholera . Although there is no effective remedy for any of these diseases , all can be prevented by sanitary precautions . British soldiers are given inoculations against smallpox , tetanus , typhoid . But a titanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Typhus and Typhoid . Carried by the louse and the rat-flea is Rickettsia prowazeki , a tiny organism which causes the dirty pink eruptions , burning fever and wild delirium of typhus fever . Prevention is simple : " no lice , no typhus . " Also louse-borne is trench fever , a milder relative of typhus , which made its first appearance in World War I. <P> Still to be tried on a mass scale are new typhus vaccines which have been produced independently by breeding Rickettsiae on chicken eggs , both by Harvard 's famed Bacteriologist Hans Zinsser and by Dr. Herald Rea Cox of the U. S. Public Health Service . About 8,000 doses of this new vaccine already have been sent to Hungary . <P> When the Germans moved into Poland last fall , they lugged with them portable shower baths , ran farm motors to make steam for delousing Polish prisoners . Because of these thorough precautions , there has been no large-scale typhus epidemic in louse-ridden Poland , although the disease has flickered there , as it has in China , for many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite different from typhus , transmitted by typhoid bacilli which lodge in human excrement , food , water . <P> Nor have the Finns been plagued with typhus . Bi-weekly steam baths are their chief protection . Dr. Herbert Alonzo Spencer of the U. S. Public Health Service , who recently spent a month traveling through Finland , believes that there is no danger of a typhoid epidemic . <P> Influenza . Greatest plague of World War I , if not the greatest in history , was the flu epidemic of 1918 which scourged every continent , almost every inhabited island . Throughout the world , more than 20,000,000 people died of it , 550,000 of them in the U. S. <P> Since influenza runs in cycles of some 20 years , some epidemiologists expect another great pandemic any year now . In recent months British doctors have anxiously watched flu graphs , but last week the British Medical Journal heaved a sigh of relief , announced that " this year 's epidemic certainly does not rank among the major visitations of recent years .
