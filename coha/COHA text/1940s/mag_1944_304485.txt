In China 's war-within-a-war , a great battle had ended in Chinese defeat : after six weeks of siege , heroic Hengyang , on the Hankow-Canton railway , fell to the Japanese . The last word from Hengyang 's starving , desperate Chinese garrison went on the radio just a few hours before the end . Said Hengyang 's commander : " I am afraid this may be my last message to you . " <P> Not all had been lost at Hengyang . The Jap had been delayed and suffered costly losses . The Chinese and their flying American allies fought on to block a juncture between the enemy advancing from the north and the enemy stalled in the south 40 miles above Canton . The Chinese were convinced that the Japs would persist in their campaign to bring the entire railroad under their control , and thus cut China in two . They were equally convinced that the outside world did not appreciate the seriousness of the threat . <P> Two who did appreciate it were Lieut . General Joseph W. Stilwell , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , *and Major General Claire L. Chennault of the Fourteenth U.S. Air Force . <P> Chennault threw all the weight of his Fourteenth Air Force and his Chinese-American Composite Wing into close support of Chinese ground troops which kept the Japs around Hengyang closely invested and even retook two towns near Hengyang which the Japs had grabbed . Chennault 's flyers gave the Japs a dose of their own 1941 medicine , by destroying 26 planes at a single field , without loss to themselves . <P> In this campaign the air force was fighting for its own survival as well as for the ground troops ; if the Japs could seize the whole railroad , and mop up eastern China at their leisure , Chennault would lose vital bases in Kiwangsi , Fukien and Chekiang provinces from which his patrols now fan out over Shanghai , Hong Kong and the South China Sea . If these fields are lost , an approach to the China coast by westbound Nimitz-MacArthur forces will be immeasurably more difficult . <P> *The Japs claimed to have captured 20 U.S. officers there .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
