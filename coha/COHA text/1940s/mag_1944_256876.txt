His theme : the scarcity of nipples in Russia . <P> " We said to the Chief of the Production Section of the Technical Department of the People 's Commissariat of the rubber industry : ' We are interested in the nipple . ' <P> " The Chief looked at us thoughtfully , seriously , benevolently , and asked : ' Nipple ? What aspects of the nipple ? ' We answered : ' The nipple in its philosophical and historical aspects-also why is it that a nipple is nowhere to be found ? ' It soon became clear that the question of aspects was not irrelevant . Aspect means view . Views of nipples these days are extremely limited . There are views-but almost no nipples . . . . <P> " In February 1944 , Comrade Borovik desperately appealed to the Department of Rubber-Technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not answered . At the beginning of September and the middle , he wailed : ' SOSka , SOS SOS SOS ! ' Silence . . . . " <P> Said Zaslavsky : " Wives write to the editors : ' When will there be nipples ? ' We give the following information : there will be nipples just as soon as the people who are charged with important business busy themselves , not with aspects , but with real work .
