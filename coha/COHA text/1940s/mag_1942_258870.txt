Ambassador Winant is coming home this week to report to the President . He will report on the progress of a relationship and a vision : war and post-war collaboration between the U.S. and Britain , some plan now unformed and unnamed , to build a better world . In such a world , in such a union the U.S. and Britain must meet each other with more than words , handshakes or good intentions . <P> In the U.S. , that seaborne vision was having heavy weather . Anti-British jokes had cropped up again , anti-British criticisms crept even into friendly editorials , were ridden hard by Anglophobes , spurred on by Axis propaganda . Many a U.S. citizen thought the closest U.S. ally a failure . <P> John Gilbert Winant , believer in the brotherhood of man , knew better . <P> Blue-Blooded Liberal . Gil Winant is a blueblood , son of an aristocratic New Yorker who made a fortune in real estate . As a boy at St. Paul 's School in Concord , N.H. , he was awkward , scraggly , uncouth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his other subjects . As a Princeton undergraduate , he left college in 1912 to campaign for Roosevelt I. <P> He went back to St. Paul 's as a teacher : a bachelor whose arms always seemed to be coming out of his sleeves , who groped painfully for the right word , hooked his hands in his pants-top like a Midwestern farmer , always looked funny in a hat , lived in a single room so littered with books that there was no place to sit . When he talked to his classes , in a soft , throaty whisper , he was hard to hear , sometimes hard to understand . <P> But no master at St. Paul 's had such an influence as Gil Winant . His shaggy , outthrust head , his dark burning eyes made those who saw him think of Lincoln . His young pupils found themselves wishing he had been born in a log cabin , were convinced that he would be President some day . They did not know whether this gauche , inarticulate teacher was a great man ; but he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he left his job as teacher . On the desk of the St. Paul 's business manager he dropped a sheaf of unpaid bills , all his money and stocks to meet them . Nine-tenths of the bills were for milk sent to neighboring poor people . He went off to Newport News , crammed 25 hours of air training into three days , went to France to fly . <P> As a flyer Gil Winant was absentminded . But he led a charmed life . The day before a big drive he came back from reconnaissance duty with 90 bullet holes in a wing and the motor half torn off . He took up another plane , had it shot from under him , spent the rest of the day in a third plane . <P> Altogether he cracked up seven planes . He flew with famed Eddie Rickenbacker . Years later Winant asked Rickenbacker if he had ever been frightened in the war . " Only once , " said Rickenbacker . " When you taxied me around a field . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
