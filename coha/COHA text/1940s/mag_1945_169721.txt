Ever since the days of the Flying Tigers , it had seemed to the embattled Chinese that when a miracle had to be worked , U.S. aviators were the men to work it . At war 's end , Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek asked the Army Air Forces to work one more . To implement the policy of getting National Government troops to places where they were needed to take Jap surrenders , the A.A.F. took over a massive task : to fly several armies to the east and north . <P> The A.A.F. had already lifted China 's Sixth Army twice , with its 25,000 men , 2,178 horses and mules , more than 1,500 tons of gear . Now it was time again to pick up the Sixth , which claims to be " the most airborne army in the world . " It was a bigger job than ever : at Chikiang the Sixth had been swollen to more than 33,000 men . The Tenth Air Force 's 443rd Troop Carrier Group loaded 45 to 50 of the men into each of its C-46s , flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nanking , where Japan 's puppets had reigned . It was all done in 22 days . In the same period , the Air Transport Command , loading 80 Chinese into each of its larger C-54s , carried 26,000 men of the Ninety-fourth Army to Shanghai . Soon the Ninety-fourth was on the wing again . This time it was bound for Peiping . At the same time , the Ninety-second Army was flown to Peiping from Hankow . <P> Going Home . The U.S. flyers broke all records for such operations . The bright autumn sky over ancient Peiping drummed with the 20th-Century roar of twin-engined aircraft as the planes swept down on the airfield , hour after hour . They disgorged their human cargo , taxied to gas pumps manned by Hopeh coolies , hopped off and were on their way south again within 50 minutes . <P> The job took nine days , instead of the scheduled month . An A.A.F. officer explained the speed : " You see what the boys can do when they 're going home . " Sometimes Chinese military passengers turned up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to take them along , but most showed good military discipline and resigned themselves to discomfort . The crowding was so great that they jampacked the floor in a sitting position , each man 's back against another 's bent knees . Because ground troops have a tendency to airsickness , an open barrel in the middle of the cabin was standard equipment . <P> One C-54 with 80 Chinese passengers and a crew of four Americans crashed near Hangchow , killing all the occupants - the greatest loss of life in any U.S. plane any where . A C46 struck a radio tower at Peiping and crashed . There were other casualties when superstitious Chinese walked across the runways in front of whirring propellers , hoping that the blades would chew up the evil spirits which they believed were following them . Some propellers missed the shadows but devoured the substance . But loss of life was amazingly small in proportion to the magnitude of the undertaking . Army airmen again had reason to point to the achievement as the greatest ever , of its kind . All that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few remaining U.S. units out of China .
