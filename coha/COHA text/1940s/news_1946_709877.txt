txt Methods of disposing of the vast surplus Government war stocks of radio and electronics equipment were overhauled sharply today because they were . costly , " sloppy " and provided " a gravy train " for inb-lot buyers . Responding to criticisms made by the House Investigating Cornmittee , George H. Moriarty , division chief of the War Assets Administration , said that these steps had been taken : The positions of thirty-two key employes out of eighty-nine in the Washington office of his electronics sales division had been eliminated . Thirty-two contracts under which agents named by the WAA sold surplus material for a 10 per cent commission plus sales costs had been canceled . The WAA directed that new contracts provide for a fixed fee or 30 to 35 per cent of sales price , without allowance for sales costs . Mr. Moriarity said : " We 've not licked everything but I think we 've whipped everything they ( the committee ) talked about . There has not been so much  --  skulduggery and dishonesty as lack of administration , decision and efficiency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agent under contract and selling electronics equipment had charged WAA. several thousands of dollars for warehousing costs in connectiOn with a $14 sale . Most Of the thirty-two contracts were canceled , Mr. Moriarty said , because sales costs were too , high and performance and cooperation had been lacking . He said that the new fixed fee system " Would put a premium on sales rather than on stortge costs . " Equipment declared surplus up to July 1 cost the Government more than $500,000,000 he added . Of this $97,500,000 worth had been sold for about 528.800,000 with sales costs running at about $9,500,000 . " That was a return of about 30 cents on the dollar of original cost , " he said , " with sales expenses cutting that to 20 cents . " Mr. Moriarty predicted that better surplus equipment was coming later . The Armed services , he explained , have seen holding back their best equipment until they learn the exte-t to which Congress might reduce appropriations . On another front , the House committee chairman and the Civilian Production Administration was attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration . Mr. La Guardia assailed criticism of the diversion by UNRRA of 7,000 tons of steel rails from the Chinese account to Zugoslavia in July . He also noted CPA testimony to the effect that the diversion involved international politics . Replying to what tie termed " wild and irresponsible statements , " Mr. La Guardia recalled that Congress itself had enacted the provision under which the diversion was made . Emphasizing that port congestion in China . had required the placing of an embargo , Mr. La Guardia observed : " It must he assumed that the chairman of the investigating committee , if he was on the job and knew what he was doing , was aware of this provision of the law . In order to avoid unnecessary storage charges , the diversion to Yugoslavia was authorized . " Then , pulling his coat off , Mr. La Guardia said he would " like to talk like an American.r " What the American people and the veterans want to know is why they ca n't get priorities for building when race tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine months . " If Civilian Production Administrator ( John D. Small ) wants to swap jobs for sixty days , clean up that ward-heeling corporation . If they want , they can stop shipments to Yuogslavia , and I 'll take care of the chiseling contractors who want to build race tracks . " Referring to Representative Slaughter 's criticisms , Mr. La Guardia termed them " the quackquack of a lame duck . " Mr. Slaughter was defeated in the ' Missouri Democratic primary by Enos A. Axtel , who was supported by Pres- ' ident Truman . " We must n't get angry with Mr. : Slaughter , " Mr. La Guardia added , ' " It 's difficult to learn international law in a police court . " Mr , Slaughter at one time was an assistant prosecutor for Jackson County , Missouri . Learning of Mr. La Guardia 's remarks concerning him , Mr. Small retorted : " Mr. La Guardia 's own disposition to go in for grandstand play is well known . In his latest tirade he has made irresponsible statements . " Asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Small said : " I would welcome any , help that Mr. La Guardia could give me on CPA 's activities , particularly on housing . "
