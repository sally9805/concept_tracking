Germany 's Rev. Martin Niemller was immured nearly two years ago in Sachsenhausen concentration camp for his leadership of un-Nazified Confessional pastors . Pastor Niemller , who was a U-boat commander in World War I , offered the Fatherland his services in World War II ( TIME , Oct. 2 ) . His offer was refused . Last week Pastor Niemller 's second offer to fight was rejected , by Grand Admiral Erich Raeder himself . <P> An explanation of Niemller 's militancy was offered by lank , twinkling-eyed Karl Barth , Swiss-born theologian who greatly influenced the Confessional group before his exile from Germany . Barth , famed for his gloomy view ( lately modified ) that man can do little here below , slyly ascribed Niemller 's position to Original Sin-man 's heritage from Adam . Wrote Barth to the Anglican Bishop of Chichester , in a letter which found its way into a Rotterdam newspaper last week : <P> " We must not forget that Niemller was always a good , a very good German , and he has remained so to this day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was of the justice of the German cause . Later he became a pastor , a very devoted pastor . But his old Adam-as with all of us-is not dead . I do not believe he lost his head when he offered his services to Hitler , but I believe he acted simply in the spirit which his old Adam dictated . "
