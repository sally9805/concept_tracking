LESS THAN , WORDS CAN SAY . By Richard Mitchell . Little , Brown &; Company . 220 pp. $8.95. ichard Mitchell , author of Less Than Words Can Say , is a professor of English at Glassboro State College , New Jersey . He got to be famous  --  famous enough for TV talk shows  --  by putting out a newsletter called The Underground Grammarian , which ridicules the language college deans use in their memorandums , and freshmen in their themes . Maybe the newsletter was good fun  --  like those gleeful-little fillers in The New Yorker that find strange new meanings in typos and comma faults  --  but Less Than Words Can Say is not fun . It is against fun : democratic government , public schools , the English language , human thought and human survival are all in danger of disappearing . Because Americans ca n't write good prose . We have heard all this before . Prophets of the death of English come and go like swarms of cicadas , filling the trees with their shells and the air with their dreamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarm ( Edwin Newman , William Safire , John Simon , Thomas Middleton ) , and Mitchell might have got lost in the general welter of warnings were it not for the new and serious ideas he proposes . One is that civilization is threatened by the passive voice . Another is that Black English was invented by " some unknown genius " whose purpose was " to postpone Black literacy for decades and perhaps forever . " Another is that violation of subject-verb agreement demonstrates incompetence in the writer no matter what his field  --  it is " the equivalent of a pharmacist handing out the wrong pills . " Another is that " an educational system that does not teach the technology of writing " ? that is. that does not concentrate on the rules of traditionJim Quinn is the author of a forthcoming book on the pop grammarians ( Pantheon Books ) . al grammar books ? " is preventing thought . " At least , I think those are the major arguments of Less Than Words Can Say . It is very difficult to tell , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins . And it is very difficult to separate the argument from the style  --  that of a rambling classroom lecture by the kind of teacher who likes to describe himself as a curmudgeon . We learn about the dangers of the . passive by learning about a tribe called the Jiukiukwe  --  who have no fire , no clothing , no shelter , no knots , no tools , a complicated system of counting that begins with the knuckle at the base of the little finger of the left hand , and no existence . Mitchell has made them up , the better to demonstrate conclusively the cause of their backwardness . Unlike civilized people ( like us , or the inhabitants of Manhasset , Long Island ) , the Jiukiukwe speak only in the passive voice . " Every other difference is because of this difference ; this is the difference . . . from which all smaller differences flow . " The passive voice does not require an active subject , so the Jiukiukwe see the world in an entirely passive way  --  and live only on tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Mitchell . Therefore , deans and bureaucrats are a danger to civilization . The logic is . irrefutable . If any member of the Jiukiukwe suddenly started to use the active voice , he would work harder and harder and soon become like the Manhassetite , and the whole tribe would " copy his verbs and his technology . . . . " Language and technology change together and to Mitchell " it seems more likely that language must change before technology . " We understand the value of the Jiukiukwe in the classroom  --  teacher begins with a metaphor " to make it real for us " and elaborates it at random . We never forget . If we are the kind of old grad who goes back to school and visits the kind of teacher we call a curmudgeon , we almost always start by saying , " You know what I remember ? I. remember the Jiukiukwe , ? who could n't even tie knots and had to count on their fingers . And every time I 'm tempted to use the passive , I rewrite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But classroom technique is not argument and metaphor is not fact . There are in fact no people as primitive as the Jiukiukwe . It has never been demonstrated that grammar limits activity . All human languages are capable of expressing what any human language can express . In English , we say the man sits at his table . No one supposes the table has male genitals . In French , the man sits a sa table . No one supposes the man is female . French and English have dif-. ferent grammatical forms to describe the same event  --  but the French and English languages describe the event equally well . But there is another answer to Mitchell . It is not in fact true that the Manhassetite is distinguished by his preference for the active . In fact , as Thomas Lounsbury pointed out long ago ( English Language , 1879 ) : " There is nothing more supremely characteristic of our speech , especially in its later periods , than the extent to which it has developed the use of passive formations . In this respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oddly enough , it was the nineteenth century  --  the century of the great technological advances of the Industrial Revolution  --  that introduced entirely new forms of the passive into English . If Richard Mitchell knew anything about the history of the English language , he would have concluded that the new passives made way for the production line and the railroad . His conclusion would have been equally silly  --  as history , as anthropology and as psychology  --  but at least it would have had one solitary fact to back it up . To demonstrate that bad grammar equals incompetence , Mitchell quotes from a letter sent out by the executive secretary of the Michigan Board of Pharmacy : " If the death of neither man nor gnat are desired . . . . " Are desired , plural verb form , is used with dedth , a singular subject . Sometimes , Mitchell says , we are in doubt about the number of the subject in English-but surely not here . " A man might safely spend his life using singular verbs to go with singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equivalent to a teller counting wrong at a bank , a pharmacist handing out the wrong pills . " For our society the Secretary 's mistake is more significant . . . . It suggests that a man in an important position . . . is careless and thoughtless in doing his work and that he seems not to have the habits of precision and correctness . . . . " It does no good to plead that the secretary was n't paying attention . " Is n't it his job to pay attention ? Is this the only time he failed to pay attention ? If his work is incorrect in such a small and easy matter , it seems likely that it will contain mistakes in large matters . . . it is only a , tiny indi-. cation of a much larger failure . . . . " Mitchell goes on with this extremely bad-tempered and solemn rant for several paragraphs , presenting an argument that demolishes itself . We know that there are differences , in mistakes . There are people , for example , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet if we ask them to add three and two they will always answer five , They know arithmetic , just as the secretary knows his language . To the Mitchells of the world , of course , any minor error will always demonstrate incompetence  --  so in order to convince them , I have tried to demonstrate the silliness of that claim by . . . well , by lying . The quotation about the death of man and gnat was not ' written by the executive secretary of the Michigan Board of Pharmacy . That secretary did write a sentence in which subject and verb do not agree in number , and Mitchell 's argument is based entirely on that violation of schoolbook grammar . But the bit about death and the gnat was written by Charles Darwin , and you can find it  --  along with an explanation that this is a common occurrence in English  --  in Otto Jespersen 's Modern English Grammar , Volume II . If you agree with Mitchell , you must , ' it seems to me , now suspect not only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darwin 's observation of animal behavior . And that is not all you must suspect : " Experience is the name that everybody gives to their mistakes . " The italics are mine , but the grammar is Oscar Wilde 's . " Each house of Congress shall keep a journal of its proceedings , and from time to time publish the same , excepting The Nation . such parts as in their judgment require secrecy . " Article I , Section 5 , third paragraph of the Constitution of the United States of America . Hard as it is for popular writers on language to accept , it is in fact true that in English , grammatical number frequently has as little to do with actual number as grammatical gender in French has to do with actual sex . The argument that our schools are either deliberately or thoughtlessly preventing thought is , delivered almost in a parody of Mitchell 's method . " It is no coincidence that the Greeks who first devised discursive prose also constructed formal logic , " says Mitchell , for whom no two thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but interdependent . " Thinking is coherent discourse , and the writing and the prose require one another . . . . It seems drastic , but we have to suspect that coherent thought is impossible for those who can not construct coherent , continuous prose . " We start with a declaration about the Greeks , which is offered without evidence . No evidence is presented anywhere in Less Than Words Can Say . This is a book without footnotes , without citations or bibliography ( except for a few horrible examples like the executive secretary ) and without learning . A few hours with the Encyclopaedia Britannica turn up no deviser of " discursive prose . " The first known writer of Greek prose is Pherecydes ( ca. 550 B.C. ) . The history - of formal logic , says the Encyclopaedia , begins with Aristotle ( 384-322 B.C. ) . Surely if prose caused logic , it took a long time to do it . And surely Confucius ( 551-479 B.C. ) , to mention only one great thinker who was not influenced by Greek inventions or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coherent thought ? Surely it took coherent thought to build Stonehenge ? Or to create the civilization of the Aztecs ? Mitchell 's " suspicion " becomes suspect in itself  --  the very apology of its manner seems designed as a rhetorical trick to stop us from checking up on the facts . And the " suspicion " is restated a few pages later as fact , without any apology , and with Mitchell 's characteristic intolerance and arrogance : " The logic of writing is simply logic . . . . People who can not put strings of sentences together in good order can not think . An educational system that does not teach the technology of writing IYeeiltIrcr ' 2 , /9/9 is preventing thought . " I do not want to fall into Mitchell 's trap of making mountains out of minor details  --  but it seems to me that moving from an unfounded suspicion to a. declaration of fact in this manner is evidence either of fundamental confusion of ideas or fundamental intellectual dishonesty . The declaration that Black English was " a gimmick " invented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postpone Black literacy for decades and perhaps forever " is on a level with the rest of the silliness in Less Than Words Can Say . The most important work in the study of Black English is Language in the Inner City , by William Labov ( University of Pennsylvania Press , 1972 ) . Labov reports the work of four investigators : himself , Paul Cohen , Clarence Robins and John Lewis . Robins and Lewis are black . Many people , black and white , have disagreed with conclusions in Language in the Inner City about what Labov calls Black Vernacular English ( Black English , he points out , includes many different dialects and different kinds of writing : from Richard Wright and Ralph Bunche to the first compositions of ghetto children ) . No one except Mitchell , who is apparently unacquainted with this major work , has ever questioned the integrity and honesty of the investigators or of the book . No one except Mitchell , has ever denied that the goal of the book was to make it easier to teach black children to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost without parallel  --  as if someone who had never read a word about it would declare the establishment of the state of Israel to be an anti-Seinitic plot . Mitchell 's arrogance does not , of course , destroy the argument of those people who say that Black Vernacular English is really only a sort of slang , not a separate language , and that black children  --  like all children  --  ought to be taught Standard English so that they can get good jobs and rise from poverty . After all , it is true that many employers and many college entrance exams discriminate against students who do not use the standard dialect well . They should learn the rules of grammar . It is impossible to , answer that argument completely in reviewing a book that does not bother to state it clearly and coherently  --  but here are a few counterarguments : There is really no point in arguing whether Black Vernacular English is a language , a dialect , an argot or a slang . That 's like arguing whether a particular plant is a wildflower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The distinction between a language and a dialect is also meaningless to linguists . English is related to German : both are Indo-European languages . They did not start out as dialects and then get promoted to language status because they were used for great literature or than scientific discovery  --  any more than a weed becomes a wildflower by being pretty . Black English is praised ( condescendingly ) by Mitchell because " its blithe disregard of grammatical form is as - crafty as it is cocky . " But Black Vernacular English does not disregard grammatical form : because it is a language , it must follow rules of grammar . They are different from the rules of Standard English and from the rules of most other American dialects . But to suppose that any language can function without grammar is like supposing that airplanes defy the law of gravity . On the contrary , airplanes obey the laws of gravity  --  and of thermodynamics . Labov points ? out some features of Black Vernacular English that are different from Standard English : the suffix - ed is not used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to problems when ghetto ' children learn to read sentences-where - ed is used . Pronunciation is completely different . For example , in the language of these children , the word trial and the word child may be pronounced exactly alike . If the teacher is telling kids to sound out the word before spelling it , the ghetto kid is going to have more trouble than his white fellow students . We may think that the , dialect is ugly . We may regret its existence . But it seems silly toignore it , and silly to expect that schools  --  starting now  --  will be able to stamp it out . I do not believe that Black Vernacular English is ugly  --  or that it should be stamped out . If it were possible to turn every black child white by administering some sort of pill , I think that would be a bad idea . A loss to a pluralistic society . If it were possible to turn Black Vernacular English into Standard by administering eight years of school , I think that would also be a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Scottish burr , the Southern drawl or the Yankee twang . School also does not seem to be the best place to change dialect : Our native way of talking  --  the one we learned from our mothers and fathers , the one we use in order to cry out in pain or delight  --  is too much a part of our idea of self . Alfred Kazin , in A Walker in the City , talks about how the Standard English ' taught in school was both a passport to success and a symbol to both parents and children of how shameful it was to be un-American and Jewish . Kazin suffered because he was forced to go to language class to correct a stutter ; these are the sufferings of a child forced outside " the bright circle of the city " and abandoned as inadequate . Surely we do not want our schools to teach children that the language of their parents and friends , of their whole culture , is inadequate and ignorant and wrong . Surely that is one lesson that is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains that there is a way of writing that is necessary to success , just as there are rules about which fork to use at an expensive restaurant . And preparing children for success means preparing them to manipulate those rules , just as they have to be taught to manipulate the salad fork and the demitasse spoon . There is really no argument about teaching children to read and write Standard English  --  only about how it is to be done . With humanity and with understanding , or with drills that the children can not understand . There is another question , of course : What kind of Standard shall we teach our children ? Shall we teach them a set of rules that no one follows ? Or shall we teach them the actual dialect of the successful ? As an example , Charles Fries , in 1940 , wrote American English Grammar , subtitled " The Grammatical Structure of Present-Day American English with Especial Reference to Social Differences or Class Dialects . " He got access to letters written to the United States Army during World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided the letters into three classes : the illiterate , who mentioned in the let- ters that they had not finished eighth grade and demonstrated that they could not punctuate or spell Standard English ; the upper class , who mentioned in the letters that they had graduated from college and were successful professionals with considerable standing in their communities and who made no gross errors in punctuation or spelling , and the middle class  --  everybody , in the middle . Fries found that expressions like " these kind of things " ? a grammatical confusion of logical number both prized and despised as a horrible example by so-called purists , ' could only be found in upper-class writing . The lowest class used " them kind of things . " The middle class avoided the construction entirely . What shall we teach our chidlren is correct ? Which construction is a barrier to success ? Finally , does n't it seem sensible to teach children  --  while we are teaching them this Magical language of success  --  that there is such a thing as tolerance , even of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday " ? If we must change the language of our children , ca n't we at least try to point out to them that they have a chance , by being sensible and humane , to make it unnecessary to change the language of our grandchildren ? And if the language is to be changed , would n't it be better to put the responsibility for the change into the hands of people who are willing to learn something about language ? At least , it seems to me , we should not be taken in by writers like Mitchell and appalling books like Less Than Words Can Say . On the dust jacket of this book Edwin Newman , himself a writer of grotesque books on language , says of Mitchell , " If English is saved , he will be one of its saviors . " The problem is that Mitchell and Newman want to save English from the people who speak it . But English does not need to be saved . The study of English , needs to be saved  --  from the ignorance and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . ?
