It was not all blood and fireworks from Moscow last week . One big piece of news was that Nikolay Tsitsin , the Soviet Union 's 46-year-old Luther Burbank , had produced a new annual wheat yielding 144 bushels an acre , quadrupling the best previous yield in the Moscow latitude . He had also got the first live seeds from attempts to cross wheat and rye with a desert plant ( Elymus giganteus ) , which may make it possible to grow those grains almost anywhere , thus opening to cultivation 150,000,000 acres of hitherto untillable Soviet land . The biggest news , however , was this : Nikolay Tsitsin appeared on the verge of perfecting a perennial , self-sowing wheat-the dream of farmers all over the world . <P> Tsitsin , a small , black-mustached scientist , showered with all manner of Soviet awards , gets $15,000,000 a year from the Government for large-scale studies in " grain economics for non-fertile soil . " He has grown fruit on vegetable vines , vegetables on trees ( e.g. , beans grafted on willows , tomatoes on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For 15 years he has worked toward a perfect wheat : one which would come up year after year without seeding , resist drought and disease , survive killing winters , wind and rain , yield at least 25 bushels an acre . <P> No. 34,085 . Now Tsitsin thinks he almost has it-his No. 34,085 meets most specifications . This strain , a cross between wheat and couch grass grows summer or winter , is drought-and rustproof , pollenizes itself , thrives even in salty soil ( producing salty wheat ) , and has a gluten content of 60% , equal to that of the best annual wheats . Experimental plantings have yielded two crops ( totaling about 68 bushels an acre ) a year . No. 34,085 still has some serious defects : it bears wrinkled grain , is hard to mill , is not as resistant to frost as Tsitsin would like . But foreign experts who have visited laboratories are convinced that in a year or two Tsitsin will have produced a true mnogoletnia pshenitza ( many-year wheat ) . <P> Tsitsin 's dream is to cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supergrain which would revolutionize the world 's bread and cereal economy . Says he : " The battle between wheat and rye in my laboratories is one of the most momentous in the world . "
