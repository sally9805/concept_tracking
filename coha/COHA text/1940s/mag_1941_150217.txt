THE STREETS OF LONDON - Thomas Burke-Scribner ( $3.75 ) . <P> The Streets of London is a rich distillation of writings on London by Londoners of every century . Distiller Thomas Burke , who discovered Limehouse as a boy , is now 53 , a gentleman of letters ; and his book is sometimes a little fat-mouthed with **32;5925;TOOLONG antiquarianism . But his subject has recently become titanic . <P> Only the masked violence of time can finally destroy London . But its streets , now being more monstrously manhandled than ever in their history , are bound to emerge from this war profoundly altered in shape and spirit . Through them has run for centuries the life and soul of a great people . In Burke 's abundant data this life and soul are glimpsed in brief , suggestive fragments , as though in a 700-year newsreel , whose end is yesterday 's bomb . <P> For centuries , London life had an almost Mediterranean vitality . Its medieval and Elizabethan fairs were riots ; its May Days were wide-open phallic festivals ; its murders were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were deafening , by night as dark as doom , at all times filthy enough to guarantee the survival only of the fittest . Londoners were so energetic that despite a generous round of fairs , festivals , bear-baitings and other formal diversions , they repeatedly broke forth in impromptu mass hell-raising . They loved sport , splendor , cruelty , gayety , anarchy . There was no regular police force in London until 1829 . <P> The 17th-century dictatorship of the Puritans , thinks Burke , cast a blight over these high spirits from which London never recovered . Its energy remained ; its gayety did not . In the 18th century , London girls no longer went maying into the fields to be deflowered ; instead May Day workmen cadged pennies around town like little boys ; Elizabethan violence gave way to the swinish japes of the well-born " Mohocks " and Regency bucks . Industrialism thickened London 's misery and thinned its spirits still more . Victorian street children ( next to Victorian factory children ) were the most wretched in England 's history ; and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen on a bathetic species called the Rowdy-Dowdy Boys , to whom hell-raising meant tipsy harmonizing on the top of a hansom . <P> The physical city tamed too . Gothic extravagance yielded to gracious Georgian faades ; Disraeli snorted over London 's architectural insipidity . The criminals , the riffraff and the poor were vital ; the rest of the nation was one sallow hunk of middle-class mutton . Where berserk bulls had once been a traffic problem , " scorchers " on bicycles were called a public menace . The last gold sovereigns of England sang on the counters of World War I. Most revealing of all was the history of city lighting : after centuries of blackness , a slow , fuliginous dawn of lanterns and dim cressets , then mirrored lamps and gas , then the star-destroying terrors of electricity , then the icy twitching of neon ; and now , suddenly , the starlit darkness , as profound as that of Norman times .
