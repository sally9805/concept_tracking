About 21,200,000 U.S. women are busy as squirrels this year trying to put up the crops of vegetables and fruit with half as much sugar as they would have used last year . To get any sugar at all for canning , each had to look her local ration board in the eye , cross her heart and tell how many quarts of fruit she canned last year , how many quarts remain on her pantry shelves , how many quarts she expects to put up this year , the number of people in her family . The ration board then allowed her only one pound of sugar for every four finished quarts . For jams and jellies , she was allowed only one pound of sugar for each member of her family . <P> All the Government agencies were strong for increased home canning , for each jar of fruit put up at home leaves a commercial-pack can for the armed forces , and more freight space for shipping other foods . WPB had provided enough glass jars , paraffin , rubber rings , OPA chipped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Bureau of Home Economics , passed out hints for spreading it thin : can fruits in their own juices without adding water ; put up without any sugar and sweeten later out of current sugar allowances ; use honey to replace half the sugar called for , corn syrup for one-third .
