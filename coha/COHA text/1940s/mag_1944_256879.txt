Cuba 's tough ex-President . Fulgencio Batista , was not in Cuba last week . He was making an ambitious tour of South America . Proclaiming himself a democratic hero , he blandly accepted praise for unexpectedly allowing his hand-picked candidate , Carlos Saladrigas , to be defeated for President in a fair election . <P> But a high Cuban official reported that when ( and if ) Batista returns to Havana , he will be arrested , " for criminal , not political , offenses.
