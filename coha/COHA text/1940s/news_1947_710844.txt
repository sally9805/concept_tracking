txt The State Department has survived what Under Secretary of State Robert A. Lovett has called " hell week " and can now discern the main points and problems of what is to be known officially as the European Recovery Program . According to responsible officials , the main points of this program , which will go to the Bureau of the Budget Friday , may be listed as follows : 1 . The Administration will ask Congress to cooperate with the sixteen Paris conference nations in attaining the production goals set out in the Paris report , but will . not endorse the $22,440,000,000 total suggested at Paris as the probable cost Of the program . 2 . Instead , it will ask for authorization to work on the fouryear plan and request an appropriation for one year . This one-year request is expected to add up , in one way or another , to between $6,000,000,000 and $7,000,000,000 and Congress will also be asked to authorize the Treasury to make available , when necessary , $3,000 , - , 000,000 for a European stabilization fund . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not propose a system of consumer rationing or price control at this time , but will adopt the recommendations of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers . These include : Allocation of scarce materials for domestic use , continuation tied strengthening of export controls , maintenance of taxes at existing levels , restrictive measures against commodities in short supply and penalties or premiums to discourage hoarding of scarce materials . In addition to these requests the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House and the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate will have before them Nov. 10 the President 's request for further shortrange relief and occupational funds . This request will include $642 ? - 000,000 for food and fuel for Italy and France this winter , plus $400 , - 000,000 for additionaL occupation costs in Germany , Japan and Korea . There was no decision over the week-end about the problem of supervising any aid that is approved by Congress . An interdepartmental committee which has been studying the Paris conference report put in another five hours on the controls problem today and Representative Christian A. Herter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Averell Harriman conferred on it in Hot Springs , Va. , but no final conclusion was reached . Four Major Questions Four major questions are plaguing both the State Department and the members of Secretary Harriman 's citizens committee as they prepare for the special session of Congress Nov. 17 . These are as follows : 1 . Should the United States insist on trying to control the expenditure of funds obtained in Europe by the sale of the food , fuel and fertilizer supplied under the European Recovery Program or should we merely negotiate separate agreements with the 16 countries , defining the ways in which the money should be spent ? 2 . Should the United States allow the 16 countries to spend dollars obtained under any European Recovery Program in third countries or should we insist on the dollars being spent in the United States ? 3 . Are restrictions to be placed on the export of finished goods Which were processed by the 16 countries wholly or partly out of materials supplied by us under the European Recovery Program ? 4 . Should the aid to Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods ? There is general agreement among the executive departments on one or two of these points . For example . their preference is to grant the aid in dollars as far as possible and to permit those dollars to be spent in third countries as far as possible . Also , the members of the interdepartmental committee and top State Department officials favor allowing the European nations to export as freely as possible all goods processed out of ERP raw materials . But all these questions are expected to invoke the sharpest debate on Capitol Hill , and if this debate is as evenly divided as is the interdepartmental committee 's ! argument over how to control the funds of the ERE ' . it can be expect-ed to go on for quite a while . The question of how to keep the aid flowing into projects that will ' achieve the broad objectives of the recovery program . instead of be-1 ing diverted into non-recovery projects , has caused the most search- ing debate not only in the interdepartmental committee but in the Harriman and Herter committees as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely , that each country receiving food , fuel or fertilizer under the ERP should set aside , in its own currency , funds to the full value of these commodities supplied to them . All three committees also seem to be in general agreement that these funds should be used to promote specific projects which will contribute most to the recovery of Europe and not be squandered in ways that will keep Europe on the dole . The question is , however , who is to decide precisely how these funds are to be used ? Also , who is ' to retain ownership of the currency and how are the agreements to be arranged and protected ? Linked to Congress Action These questions are being carefully debated now , for it is generally agreed that what is decided in the Harriman and Herter committees in the next few days is likely to be decisive with Congress . In fact , if the State Department I can not bring the leading members of the Harriman and Herter committees to its point of view before Wednesday , it is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriman experts . Of the three committees dealing ' with the subject , the Interdepartmental Committee at the State Department aims to keep the controls to a minimum . In the last few days its experts have been arguing that it would be sufficient for the United States to negotiate arrangements with each of the sixteen countries defining the broad terms under which the food-fuelfertilizer funds should and should not be spent . The Herter committee , however , wishes to be more specific in the agreements to be negotiated and it favors much stricter controls . It would keep the funds under the close control of a five-main trust , three members of which would be from the United States and two ' rom the country concerned . Such a committee , with an ' unerican majority , would , in the ipinion of Mr. Herter , be in a bet , ter position to see that the money ' is spent for recovery and nothing else . This system , which has influential backers in the Harriman committee , is opposed by officials of the executive branch for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad faith and can easily be evaded by manipulating the currency ; and second , because it would give the Communists justificationfor the charge that the United States would be interfering ' in the internal affairs of the European nations . These arguments will get a final review tomorrow at the State Department and will be put into final form for Capitol Hill within another week . Then the issue of controls is really expected to come to the fore .
