txt Exploitation of Egypt by the British was assailed by Dr. Hafex Afifi Pasha , Egyptian delegate to the United Nations security council , in a speech here tonight before the Overseas Press club . Dr. Mill expressed admiration for " such an achievement as the creation of ' the British empire , " but said it is bound to evoke strong resentment in " those who are exploited . " The resentment is the same , " Dr. Afifi said , " whether such exploitation is accompanied by some benevolence and semblance of freedom , or by downright iron rule . " Industrial Growth Retarded Ile said Egypt is grateful to Britain for developing the country 's irrigation system and for establishing financial stability , but accused the British of " purposely or perhaps unwittingly " overlooking o t h e r things ' essential to Egypt 's progress and prosperity . " Industrial growth was discouraged , " he charged . " Education , health , and sanitation were sadly neglected . " Reviewing British . activities in Egypt , Dr. Afifi said British troops were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting foreign interests " and have been there ever since . British Real Rulers From 1882 to 1922 , when " independence with yeservations " was granted , ' he said Egyptian cabinets were " no , more than window dressing , " and that the country was ruled by the British . Egyptians were forced to ship cotton to England for conversion into piece goods , which was then exported and sold to Egyptians at a good profit , he said , He said these conditions were corrected by the declaration of 1922 , but added that since then British business men got . favored treatment in government contracts thru pressure . Costly to Treasury " Nearly all big government con tracts , ? such as for dams , bridges , railway rolling stock and so forth , were given to a British firm , regard . less of the fact that offers from nonBritish firms would have been less costly to the Egyptian treasury , " he said . . Dr. Afifi pleaded for " the friendliest relations " with Britain , but insisted that " we also want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I hope no one will deny us that right . "
