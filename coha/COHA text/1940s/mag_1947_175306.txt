Alexander Neill 's father was a strict Scottish schoolmaster , who used to spank his children rather repetitiously . Young Neill developed a fear of his father that haunted him until early manhood . Years later , when he began studying child psychology , he decided to found a school of his own , to produce children who would go through life free from fear and who would never need to be psychoanalyzed . Last week , by special invitation , Headmaster Neill , 64 , was in the U.S. to give a series of lectures to interested educators and parents on the psychological and educational theories of Alexander Neill . <P> In 1921 , in a rambling , red-brick Victorian house with a rambling garden , he opened his famed progressive Summerhill School for boys &; girls , where 70 sons &; daughters of middle-class parents enjoy its unusual atmosphere . " The art of teaching , " Neill decided , " is the art of leaving children alone . " Summerhill is Britain 's most progressive school . At his school ( " That dreadful School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no discipline , except for such rules as the children lay down in their weekly meetings . The children are permitted to swear , steal , smash things up , masturbate , lie , play hookey or do anything else that , in Schoolmaster Neill 's judgment , will rid them of inhibitions . At Summerhill , " inhibitions " are a prime preoccupation . Discipline , Neill believes , is " a substitute for a knowledge of children . " <P> The school teaches the usual British public-school curriculum , but in a way that would make most public teachers ' hair stand on end . There are no examinations ( says Headmaster Neill : " They are easy methods of discovering what is n't worth discovering " ) . There is no compulsion to attend classes . Says plump , pleasant Mrs. Neill : " The young children are so terribly active with their own interests , they often do not attend school much until they reach the age of twelve . " <P> General Meeting . The big event of the school week is the Friday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible to be progressive unless the children govern themselves completely . The general meeting is presided over by a student chairman . Each child has a vote . The vote of a four-year-old counts just as much as Neill 's or any other teacher 's . All school problems are brought before the meeting and suitable punishments ( for offenses such as excessive rowdyism or chronic stealing ) are voted by a show of hands . <P> Often Neill is voted down by the council . Once he tried to introduce automatic fines for swearing . He took a shrewd line : " Why should I suffer if some fathead swears in front of a prospective parent ? It 's not a moral question at all ; it is purely financial . You swear and I lose a pupil . " Said a 14-year-old : " Neill is talking rot . If the parent is shocked he does n't believe in Summerhill anyway . " The council decided to go on swearing .                  @ @ @
