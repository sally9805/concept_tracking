Suburban real estate , like everything else in the U.S. , is having a spanking fine boom . Demands and prices for homes are at record levels ; mortgage loans are being made on appraisals far in excess of the long-term property value . Yet only a minority of observers see a repetition of the record real-estate panic of the early ' 305 . This time the boom seemed on much firmer ground . <P> Gloomiest observer was the Federal Home Loan Bank Administration . Over &; over again during the past two years FHLB Commissioner John H. Fahey has warned that every type of financial insti tution has been making " reckless " loans , that the " unsound wartime realty boom " could have but one end : a postwar wave of foreclosures that might make the last depression look like a sideshow . <P> But the majority of bankers , realtors and neutral observers regarded this hair-raising view as far too extreme , for three reasons : <P> Loans being made now , even on inflated values and for long terms , are being steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the last panic , second mortgages have virtually disappeared , as poor risks . <P> Now , instead of running three to five years , and therefore requiring payment in huge sums , mortgages today go up to easy 25-year terms , comparable to rent . <P> There is no really wild speculation . Instead of buying property sight unseen and finding it later two miles out at sea , the U.S. people have bought homes to live in , or as a hedge against inflation , or both . <P> Sky-high war wages and a drastic short age of dwellings are responsible for sky-high prices . But the would-be homeowner wants a home for his family , whatever the cost . During the first half of 1944 , average prices for all types of real estate were 12% above the 1943 level , with some industrial areas reporting a wartime rise in private dwellings of 54% and up . For example , one Los Angeles house that sold in 1942 for $7,850 brought $15,500 last winter . In Pittsburgh a man bought a new house for $10,000 last summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the really big real-estate boom has not yet even started . Washington planners are counting on new residential building as a chief item in providing postwar employment . Predictions as to the number of houses that will be built in the first post war year vary from 560,000 to 1,000,000 . <P> And an even bigger project will be repairs , since hardly a house in the U.S. will not need some kind of refurbishing . Thus , while $2,000,000,000 may be spent in the first year for new houses , $3,000,000,000 will go into repairs on existing structures .
