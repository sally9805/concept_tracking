ALBANY , Aug. 18 ? Governor Dewey accepted by telegraph today Secretary Hull 's " invitation " to consultation on international security questions and named John Foster Dulles , his adviser on foreign affairs , as his " representative " at the conferences . Early this evening Governor Dewey received a telegram in which Secretary Hull said that he welcomed conferences with Mr. Dulles . The Governor sent his message , his secretary said , solely on the basis of Secretary Hull 's remarks at a press conference yesterday , when , asked by a reporter if , in view of his desire to keep security discussions out of party politics , he would welcome a conference with Governor Dewey , ife replied as ollows : " I welcome such conferences with others who come solely in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down in conference and offer any feasible cooperation entirely free from personal political partisan chip . I would welcome such a conference with Governor Dewey . " Text of Dewey Telegram Mr. Dewey 's telegram today was as follows : " Hon. Cordell Hull , Secretary of State , Washington , D. C. " I am happy to accept your proposal for consultation made at your press conference yesterday and to designate Mr. John Foster Dulles as my representative . " Mr. Dulles , who is well known to you and to President Roosevelt , has given a lifetime of study and constructive action in the field of foreign affairs . I consider him one of the ablest of American authorities on international relations . He is fully acquainted with my views and has my complete personal confidence , which I am happy to say is shared by a number of members of the United States Senate of varying political views . " In view especially of the progress of the war in Europe I am convinced that every effort to organize both temporarily and permanently for the establishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extend my fullest cooperation to the end that the result should be wholly bipartisan and should have the united support of the American people . " Mr. Dulles is prepared to come to Washington and be available regularly for conference and consultation as soon as I receive your reply . " Thomas E. Dewey . " Two days ago Governor Dewey issued a statement declaring that proposals preceding the Dumbarton Oaks conference , starting Monday , indicated that the United States , Russia , Britain and China planned to rule the post-war world Permanently on a power politics basis , " coercing " the smaller nations . This was denied yesterday by Secretary Hull , who recalled the Moscow declaration and the Senator Connally resolution , and asserted that no arrangement such as that described by Governor Dewey and denounced by him was " contemplated or ever has been contemplated by this Government , or , as far as we know , by any of the , other Governments . " Governor Dewey 's desire to participate in the coming talks on the shape of the post-war world re // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin D. Roosevelt in December , 1932 , and February , 1933 , when Mr. Hoover , on his way out of the White House , invited his1 selected successor to conferences to work out a continuing policy on the domestic crisis . Mr. Roosevelt accepted the invitation , but made it clear in the talks that he regarded a joint policy unwise , if not impossible . Mr. Dewey 's move , as a poten-1 tial successor to Mr. Roosevelt , is along a different track . A sharing by Governor Dewey in information about and responsibility for the various peace moves would remove from the election campaign the argument that continuity in foreign policy and an informed representation at the peace table could be presented only by a continuation of the Roosevelt Administration . It was noted that Governor Dewey again stressed today , as he did two days ago , that his views had the approval of Senate members who would be called upon to vote on any peace treaty or plan of international cooperation , whether or not he was elected President . Mr. Dulles has long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs . In today 's telegram the Governor presented him , officially for the first time as his adviser in the field . He was put , in the New York delegation to the ' Republican national convention at Governor Dewey 's personal request . Mr. Dulles is senior member of the law firm of Sullivan &; Cromwell , 48 Wall Street . He was born in 1888 . His grandfather , the late John W. Foster , Secretary of State in the Harrison Administration , took him to the second Hague peace conference in 1907 , where he acted as a secretary . He was later an aide to Woodrow Wilson and was chief counsel on reparations and financial matters at the Versailles Peace Conference . He was also an American member of the Reparations Commission and held various other international advisory posts during the Twenties and Thirties . He is now chairman of the Commission on Just and Durable Peace of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America .                   @ @
