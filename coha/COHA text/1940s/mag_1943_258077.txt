To answer some of the questions our subscribers have been asking about how TIME gathers , verifies , writes , and distributes its news . <P> If you had to take off for India-or Sicily-or just England-where would you start looking for transportation ? What permits would you need ? What would you do about inoculations-and insurance-and money ? <P> Right now we have sixteen TIME &; LIFE correspondents , editors , writers and cameramen slated for foreign assignment-so multiply your own imaginary travel difficulties by sixteen , and I think you will see why Jack Manthorp has a full-time job here just helping our editors get quickly to where they need to go overseas . <P> Outside the Western Hemisphere getting anywhere except to England is almost impossible unless the correspondent is officially accredited to the Army or Navy . That means weeks being looked up by the F.B.I. , G2 , or Naval Intelligence , and then getting cabled permission from the U.S. Area Commander . ( For that matter , there is absolutely no way of getting through to most war zones except on Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondent can even apply for a passport he must get permission from his local draft board to leave the country-and after the passport comes through the visa rush begins . Manthorp got one correspondent visas for thirteen countries in a single day , but some governments are not so easy . For example , no visa for India is granted without a cabled O.K. from New Delhi , and Portugal is even harder . <P> Currency regulations change so fast that they always have to be looked up again at the last minute . In Mexico , for instance , you can carry all the money you want- provided it is all in silver and two-dollar bills . England , on the other hand , set a $50 limit . For most countries the best rule is to take as little cash as possible-but Costa Rica wo n't take a chance on letting you in unless you have $250 . ( Incidentally , it is almost impossible to estimate costs on trips like these . Some expense accounts run over $10,000-but Senior Editor Wertenbaker 's three months with our Army in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps each man buy the right correspondent 's uniform for the climate he will work in ( average cost $358 ) . He sees that they get the right inoculations against as many as nine diseases-typhoid , paratyphoid , smallpox , tetanus for everywhere-plus yellow fever and typhus for the South Pacific or Africa-plus cholera , bubonic and pulmonic plague for Asia ( the tetanus inoculations alone take 42 days ) . And through Lloyds of London we take out a $25,000 personal insurance policy for each TIME traveler . <P> If a correspondent carries a camera , Manthorp must register it with the customs . And the censors must have a look at any printed matter-even dictionaries and travel guides-that our man may want to take along .
