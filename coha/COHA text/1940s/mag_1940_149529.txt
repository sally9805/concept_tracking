New York City 's Hunter College is the world 's biggest college for women . Seldom mentioned in the same breath with Wellesley , Smith and Vassar , although it is older ( 70 years ) than Wellesley or Smith , free , plebeian Hunter College boasts no distinguished line of presidents , no dormitories , no daisy chain . Its main " campus " has long been a group of ugly old buildings on Manhattan 's East 68th Street . Its 10,000 students commute to classes by subway . <P> This month Hunter students get a new building and a new president . Their new building , a 16-story affair at 68th Street and Park Avenue , is as splendid as a cine-mansion , with thickly carpeted floors , teakwood walls . Among the first to move in ( the building was not quite completed ) was Hunter 's new President George Nauman Shuster . <P> Wisconsin-born , a Notre Dame graduate , Mr. Shuster was head of his alma mater 's English department for four years , from 1925 to 1939 was an editor of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic , has lectured and written extensively on Catholicism , English literature , modern German history , edited an edition of Mein Kampf . <P> Last week he had many plans for Hunter . What the college lacks in swank , it makes up in vigor . Hunter girls , mostly Jewesses who grew up on the sidewalks of New York , go to college to study . Smart ( they must pass stiff entrance tests ) and hardworking , they often help support their families while attending college . Many Hunter girls become public-school teachers ; some , Macy 's salesgirls . But most of them ( relatively more than at such a college as Vassar ) will be housewives . <P> To prepare them for that career , President Shuster plans to start an institute of child psychology , teach his girls homemaking , dietetics , self-grooming . His toughest problem : how to deal with patrioteers ' attacks on Hunter girls for their " radicalism . " * His policy : let the girls have their say . " New York students , " said he , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. " <P> - Already under way is a legislative investigation of alleged subversive influences in New York City schools .
