Imogene Stevens was the kind of girl at whom men always looked twice . When Imogene landed in neat , suburban New Canaan , Conn. ( pop . 6,500 ) , New Canaanites looked at her in various ways . <P> Dark-haired , dark-eyed Imogene was the bride of young Major George Stevens III . She had come to New Canaan because that was where George 's parents lived . George , an officer in an airborne division , had to go overseas . Imogene settled down in a brown-shingled little house next door to the Charles Miltons on decorous East Maple Street . <P> Beauty 's Lot . Parting from soldiers seemed to be Imogene 's lot . Born on a farm near Amarillo , Tex. , she had first married when she was only 18 and just out of high school . The man she married , Carl Funderberg , was more than twice her age . They had a baby . <P> Funderberg , who became a gunner in a B17 , finally divorced her . She was an " unchaste " person-that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their child , but Imogene refused to give the baby up . She moved to Nebraska , got a job at the Alliance Air Base , where she met and married George Stevens . Sergeant <P> Funderberg finally went off to Europe , where he was shot down , captured and later released . He came home and married a widow named Mrs. Schmaltz . <P> But all that was past . In New Canaan , Imogene was more interested in the present . She was frequently photographed in scanty swimming suits . She turned her dark , innocent eyes on next-door neighbor Charlie Milton , susceptible treasurer of a bolt company , father of three . New Canaan tongues began to clack . <P> End of a Party . Charlie Milton 's wife left home . She was gone for months . But she finally came back , and one night last week she and Imogene went out together . Charlie met them at Amend 's Tavern and they all went back to Imogene 's , where they had a heated argument . Focus of the argument : Charlie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen door . Imogene , just as wrathful , rushed out and hurled a beer glass through one of the Miltons ' windows . <P> Charlie took his wife for a walk to cool off . Imogene , fondling an automatic pistol which her husband had given her , fired a few practice shots into her fireplace . <P> End of a Fishing Trip . At this point 19-year-old Seaman Albert Kovacs , with his brother James , appeared on the dangerously crowded stage . Al , a veteran of the Pacific , now stationed at Portsmouth , had been fishing . He had had a date with Faith Coombs , an 18-year-old high-school girl who looked after the Milton children . He was late ; Faith was not there . Except for the children upstairs , asleep , the Milton house was empty . Al raided the icebox for some beer and he and James sat down to drink it . <P> Al was sitting at the piano when Imogene burst in . The Kovacs brothers were a little startled . She demanded to know what they were doing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and walked toward the stairway . As James Kovacs remembered it later , there was the crash of a shot and Al dropped . Imogene fired two more shots . Then she demanded : " Now will you leave ? " <P> James later told police : " I half dragged , half carried him to the porch , with her holding the gun on us . ... I put my hand on his breast . I decided he was dead . "
