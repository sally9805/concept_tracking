Bomb bursts and gun cracks are not the only war noises that shatter or dull the mechanism of the human ear ( TIME , Nov. 2 ) . The racket and roar of heavy machinery is also a menace . To quell such clamor , some workers use plugs of cotton , rags , rubber , wax . These are not always sanitary , are sometimes dangerous . <P> They are now being replaced in a number of industries by made-to-measure ear mufflers of smooth plastic , put out by Manhattan 's Maico , Inc. , an adaptation of their main product-hearing aids . An impression is taken of the outer folds and canal entrance of the ear . From this cast a polished plastic plug is made which extends into the auditory canal , is locked in place by a lip which fits over the helix ( rim of the external ear ) . Light and clean , the plug is easily inserted with a twisting motion , can not be pushed in too far , leaves sufficient leeway to equalize air pressures .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
