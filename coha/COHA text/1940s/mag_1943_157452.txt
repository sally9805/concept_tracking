In booming West Coast war centers , metal filing cabinets are hens ' - teeth scarce . The Army , Navy and the big manufacturers have combed the countryside , town by town , unable to find any . <P> Result : up blossomed a tiny war-baby industry , making wooden filing cabinets whose drawers are apt to sound like a crate of apples rolling downstairs when they are opened-when they can be opened . <P> One of the best of these war babies is the Carnation Lumber Supply Co. in Carnation ( pop . 400 ) , in Washington 's Snoqualmie Valley , some 35 miles from Seattle . Father of the baby is chunky , inventive Claire W. Austin , 34 . In the spring of ' 42 , he quit his carpenter 's job in Seattle 's Grandy Shipyards after he got a $35 Army order for wooden letter trays . Soon he landed a bigger order for a desk he designed . He also designed special jigs and fixtures , so that beginners could turn out good cabinet work . <P> Shortly , the Carnation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later , Austin designed a wooden filing cabinet whose drawers actually slide smoothly . His simple secret : when resinous pine is rubbed against a hard wood , both become slippery and glass-smooth , slide more easily the more they are rubbed . Orders for 1,700 poured in , have kept the Carnation Co. hustling as it supplied a good chunk of the requirements of the Army and Boeing Aircraft in Seattle . <P> Unlike many a war-baby boss , Austin does not worry over absenteeism . His workers wander off at any time to do chores , tend their bees , chickens and strawberry plants . Nor does he worry over profits . Said he : " We are n't exactly doing this to make money . What would we do with it ? We 're just having some fun . "
