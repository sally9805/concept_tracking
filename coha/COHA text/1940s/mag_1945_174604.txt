One helper President Truman needed badly was a press secretary to replace Franklin Roosevelt 's seasoned Steve Early . <P> As they had for two of his other appointments in nine days , his thoughts turned toward the men of Missouri . A Missourian was available . <P> His choice : tall , stooped , scholarly Charles Griffith Ross , 59 . Washington correspondent of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , a discerning and fair-minded news veteran who has long had the respect of Washington 's critical , competitive correspondent corps . In the decades since he was graduated from the Independence ( Mo. ) high school with Harry Truman , Charley Ross has served 16 years as chief of the P-D 's Washington bureau , handled almost every kind of story , and specialized brilliantly in political reporting . <P> In 1931 Charley Ross won journalism 's Pulitzer Prize for his thoughtful inquiry into the depression era and the remedies applied by the Hoover Administration . <P> In 1934 his boss , Joseph Pulitzer , called him home to edit the editorial page , but Ross missed Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his constant readers was Truman . <P> <P> Last week , Charley Ross was both elated and worried by the abrupt offer of his boyhood chum . If he accepted , he would have his finger on an exciting piece of history . Still , the job was a well-known heartbreaker , and it paid only $10,000 a year ( Ross gets $35,000 from the P-D ) . Besides , Publisher Pulitzer was dead against his leaving . <P> But Harry Truman 's mind was made up . He called in Ross , convinced him , then called Pulitzer long-distance and convinced him . Truman agreed to let his new press secretary cover the San Francisco Conference for the P-D before coming to the White House . Together , they agreed to keep the appointment secret until Ross 's return . <P> Then they decided to call Miss Tillie . <P> Moments later , a telephone rang in Independence , Mo . Sprightly Miss Matilda Brown , 75 , who had taught high-school English to Harry Truman and Charley Ross , answered it , heard an operator say : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said the President : " You 'll be glad to know that Charley Ross has agreed to work with me as press secretary . " <P> Fairly bursting with pride , Miss Tillie promptly spilled the beans to the local papers . Next day , the President made it official in an announcement to the press .
