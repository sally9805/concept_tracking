In the raw , early darkness of a Christmas-week evening , Manhattan 's slushy 45th Street rustled with the shuffling sound and movement of people . Fifth Avenue 's traffic brayed and rumbled close by . But the opened window , 16 floors above the din , was just an anonymous rectangle of light-one of thousands held by the city 's glowing towers against the black sky . No one in the streets noticed the man who was silhouetted in its frame . No one saw him start his long , tumbling drop to the street . <P> He fell on a heap of dirty snow . Passersby stopped , turned , and saw him then ; a thin , black-haired man lying broken and dying . The curious gathered , and with them blue-overcoated policemen . Then an ambulance nosed up . <P> At the hospital , where he was pronounced dead , he was given back his name : his billfold showed that he was Laurence Duggan , 43 , of suburban Scarsdale .

He had spent 14 years in the State Department , nine as head of the Latin American Division , four as adviser on political relations . Since 1946 he had held a $15,000-a-year job as president of the Carnegie-financed Institute of International Education , which provided for a flow of exchange students between the U.S. and foreign countries . <P> An Airplane Ticket . But none of this explained his death . Police , who hurried to the Institute 's 16th floor offices , found few clues . Duggan 's brown tweed overcoat and his briefcase ( which contained a ticket for an airplane trip to Washington the next day ) were placed near his desk . His left overshoe was on the floor ; he had been wearing only the right one when he fell . Police found no note . <P> One of the two windows of his office was open . Measuring , the police found that it was raised 28 inches , was 44 inches wide . Its sill was 33 inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was slight , but fairly tall ( 5 ft. 10 in. , 140 Ibs. ) , could have fallen out ? How ? Or had he jumped ? Why ? <P> The police had no quick answers . But when the news of Duggan 's death reached Washington , South Dakota 's headline-hunting Republican Congressman Karl E. Mundt decided excitedly that he had them all . He called a midnight press conference and made a sensational announcement . <P> Duggan 's name , Mundt said , had cropped up at a secret hearing held by the House Committee on Un-American Activities early in December . At that time , Russian-born Isaac Don Levine , an ex-Hearstling who edits the anti-Communist publication Plain Talk and who collaborated with General W. G. Krivitsky on his memoirs , had made a damaging charge . He said that in 1939 he had heard ex-Communist Whittaker Chambers tell former Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle that Duggan was one of six men from whom Communists had obtained secret documents . <P> Mundt was asked when the committee would disclose the rest of the six names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parnell Thomas as a stumbling block to a just and objective investigation of Communist activities in the U.S. " We will give them out , " he wisecracked , " as they jump out of windows .
