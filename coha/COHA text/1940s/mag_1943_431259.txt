It was Christmas Eve of the year 1939 , and the snow lay knee-deep on the campus of the SpanishAmerican Normal School at El Rito , New Mexico . The headmaster of the school was already in bed when a little past midnight he was awakened by the ringing of the doorbell . A beautiful Christmas scene greeted him when he opened the door . For there in the snow stood a farmer and his two little children , behind them a flock of sheep , above them a waning moon and a sky full of stars . The farmer had brought the children to the school for a year 's stay ; the twentysix sheep were in payment of the fee ; the moon and stars were the silent witnesses . Without knowing it , the farmer was reenacting history ? ancient history . He was going back to a time long ago , before money existed , when man 's wealth was reckoned by the number of cows , sheep , and pigs he possessed and when the chief medium of exchange was cattle . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also was dramatizing the history of several of our words associated with money . Fee , for instance , comes from the word feoh , which among the AngloSaxons meant any cattle . Pecus , the Latin word for cattle , in the same way gives us pecuniary , our adjective for money , and impecunious , which means to be habitually without money . In Italian , pecore still retains the original meaning of sheep . Our words capital ( money ) and cattle come from the same Latin word , capitale , which means property of any kind . Curiously enough , we use the word stock with both ? on Wall street with bonds and on the farm live ! Words coming from the m and stars preserve for us a record of some of man 's superstition Lunatic , for example , comes from luna , the Latin word for moon . It was once believed that the changes of the moon affected your mental condition , especially if you stared at the moon too long or let it shins on you while sleeping . Though there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there still are some who look upon the stars as beacon lights of they destinies . The word disaster show us how widespread this belief was in early times . The Greek word for star is aster ( giving us astronomy .. asterisk , and the flower aster ) . Dis is a negative prefix meaning cos -- Crary to or against , so that a disaster is something contrary to the star ? contrary to your " lucky " star . The farmer who was exchanging twenty-six sheep for a year 's lodging for his children probably wanted them to be above superstitions . F one thing , he wanted them to real books and to learn how to write Our word write ( related to the modern German word reisses ) comes from the old Anglo-Saxon word writan , meaning to scratch ? because among the Saxons writings were scratched on the inner bark of the beech tree . Their word beech was boc , giving us our wo book . In time , too , the farmer 's children , would learn to sign their names . Notice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again through a word we get an insight into man 's development . The expression " signing one 's name " takes us back a time when the man who could write was the exception rather than the rule .  | Therefore , he had literally to sign his name ? to make his mark or sign . The farmer 's children would sign their names with pens , but they would not use penknives to make or mend those pens . From a backward glance at the word pen ( Latin penna , meaning feather or quill ) we realize that the steel pen is a modern invention . Before that , all pens were literally feathers . In French ( plume ) , in German ( feder ) , in Russian ( pero ) , the words for feather and for pen are identical . Once a penknife was needed to make a point on a quill ! The farmer may have known something of the prejudices of big-city people toward him , but he probably did n't know how deeply rooted these prejudices are in words that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment words like , boorish , savage , heathen , pagan , and villain . None of us would feel flattered to be called any of these . Yet once , before the corrosion of prejudice began its work , they were perfectly respectable words . Boor meant a farmer . We see it in our word neighbor , which merely meant a nigh ( or near ) bor or farmer . We see it in Bauer , the German word for farmer . We get savage , via the French , from a Latin word , silva , meaning woods ; a savage was merely someone who lived in the woods . Pennsylvania means William Penn 's woods . The word villain obviously comes from the same word as villa and village , and in the word heathen we recognize the word heath . Pagan , related to the French paysan , which gives us our English word peasant , originally meant merely a country dweller . The word peasant itself is so corroded that we reserve it for farmers of foreign countries . THE big-city boys were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning . They also decided to use " city " words for the more attractive human traits . An urbane person is wellgroomed and refined in manner , the opposite of a boor . Urbane comes from the Latin word for city , which also gives us urban and suburban ( sub means under , reminding us that ancient cities , like fortifications , were built on hills or heights whenever possible ) . Civilized comes from a word from which we get civic , civilization , and finally city itself ; and it is possible that our word polite is ultimately related to words like metropolis ( mother city ) and cosmopolite ( a citizen of the world ) . We see polls , Greek for city , in Indianapolis , Sevastopol , Annapolis , and Constantinople . From the Greek , too , we get the X in Xmas . The Greek letter chi ( the same in form as our X ) , is the first letter in Christos . Christmas is , of course , Christ plus Mass . Noel , which we sing so frequently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natalis , the Latin word for birthday . The Yule in Yuletide comes from jol , an old Norse word for Christmas feast . From jol we probably get our word jolly , too . Tide is just an old English word for a special time or occasion . And so ? with the children safely tucked in bed , the sheep secure in their corral , and the farmer on his way home through the snow ? a merry Christmas , a joyous Noel , and a jolly Yuletide to all !  |
