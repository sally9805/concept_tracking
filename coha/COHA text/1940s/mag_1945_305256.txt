This havoc was created not by a demolition squad , but by three nine-year-old boys . On a Sunday afternoon they broke into Brooklyn 's Public School 173 by cutting a window screen , rampaged until suppertime . When the janitor arrived next morning , he found windows shattered , pictures torn , walls smeared , light bulbs smashed , desks and chairs ripped apart , a grand piano stripped of keys and strings , the remnants of two bonfires , the leavings of crackers and jam in a domestic science kitchen , a total of 21 classrooms in shambles . The damage-which added up to $5,000 in a five-page , single-spaced report-was so extensive that school had to be let out for the day . The three boys , traced through some model airplanes they had stolen from the school , are from decent but cramped homes . Questioned by police , they said that they were just having a little fun .
