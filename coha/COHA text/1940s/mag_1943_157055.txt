The outstanding military lesson of this campaign was the continuous , calculated application of air power . . . employed in the most intimate tactical and logistical connection with ground troops . <P> This summary by General Douglas MacArthur of the successful Papuan campaign last week won the Army 's only four-star field commander editorial plaudits as a new and forceful advocate of air power . But it made many an airman sad . <P> They were not sad because General MacArthur , not always an enthusiast for air operations , had recognized and proved air power as an adjunct of vast potency to the ground and naval forces . The Germans had proved that in Poland , in the Lowlands and many times since . So , with great virtuosity , had the U.S. Navy . <P> Doctrine . What made airmen sad was that that was the only recognition made by the Hero of Bataan of war 's newest mode of fighting . Douglas MacArthur 's conclusion was that with the help of air transport , reconnaissance and bombardment the advance of U.S. fighting men up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Most men of the Army Air Forces , and probably many in the naval air arm , still believe in independent air power . They believe that Japan can be beaten by bombardment from China , that Germany can be struck down if enough air power is amassed in Britain . <P> They know that Germany failed in the first great application of independent air power ( against Britain ) . But they argue that Germany came with too little and that its little was stopped , perilously close to success , by independent air power from British soil , i.e. , the R.A.F. Fighter Command . Yet by events and the utterances of Army ground generals they see only waning hope that an all-out air theater will be established in this war . <P> Many an influential general is against it , prefers the old reliable way , still contends that " infantry is the queen of battle , " that air force is just a new handmaiden . Beyond that , the development of World War II to date is against concentrating air strength anywhere . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II has the beginnings of an air theater envisioned by Billy Mitchell in Britain , where Sir Arthur Harris ' Bomber Command and Ira Eaker 's Eighth Air Force have more than the nucleus of the kind of organization airmen want , to prove or disprove their doctrine for all time . But the force is not yet prepared to hit Germany day &; night with full strength . And even if it is built to that strength , the proof will not be conclusive . Men on the ground in Russia and in North Africa have weakened Germany too much for air power to fly in at this late date and claim credit for victory . <P> For air power 's failure to be ready for the test , airmen can blame themselves as much as the officers they accuse of having old-fashioned views . Even Gring , with the resources of his country behind him , overestimated the potency of his new weapon and therefore underestimated the needs of his air armada . In the U.S. , where economy , not battle , was the goal , the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new Flying Fortresses ( and got 19 ) . * Even Britain , with an independent air force , had too few aircraft when war came . Only in fighters was the R.A.F. strong enough .
