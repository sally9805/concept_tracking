When a Dominican wanted to buy a pair of shoes or bet on a horse-or pay cash for anything with folding money-he paid in U.S. greenbacks , because his country had no paper currency. * That was the heritage of bankruptcy and economic dependence on the U.S. Now the Dominican Republic is strong , its external debt paid off ( since July ) , its internal debt minuscule . Last week , Dominican banks started taking in time-worn green-inked engravings of Washington and Lincoln , replacing them with crisp Dominican peso notes bearing the likeness of local heroes . <P> For the present , both the U.S. dollar and the Dominican peso will be legal tender , but after three months , by Dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo 's law , the dollar may be withdrawn from general circulation . The Central Bank will have the right to control all dollar exchange . Chief advantage for Dictator Trujillo : complete control over all his country 's dollar purchases . <P> * Other countries in which U.S. greenbacks circulate : Honduras , Panama , Cuba , Haiti .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
