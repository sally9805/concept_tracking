The U. S. has in recent years heard more about civil liberties than about the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee . Senators Robert Marion La Follette ( Wisconsin ) and Elbert Duncan Thomas ( Utah ) spent $200,000 and four years studying the seamy side of U. S. industry . They uncovered a grubby array of labor spies , gunmen , strikebreakers , provocateurs of labor strife , propagandists , munitionists-and industrialists who bought these seamy services . <P> Last week Bob La Follette and Elbert Thomas finally had up in the Senate a bill to " give vitality to the rights of free speech and assembly . . . which have been denied by private spy systems and by private force . " They proposed to ban i ) spying on labor ; 2 ) professional strikebreakers and strikebreaking agencies ; 3 ) armed , private guards anywhere except on company property ; 4 ) the private possession or use of such industrial munitions as machine guns , sawed-off shotguns , gas bombs . <P> No worse time could have been chosen for such a bill ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but Defense . La Follette &; Thomas watched the Senate hack away . Trying to save the essence of his bill , Bob La Follette conceded , placated , did some hacking himself . But he did not concede enough to satisfy Senator Robert Rice Reynolds of North Carolina . <P> Resplendent , redundant Bob Reynolds has devoted most of his Senate career to saving the U. S. from aliens . ( In 1938 , despite this prejudice , he returned from a trip to Germany , admonishing the U. S. to stop hating the Nazis , and one of his subsequent speeches was heartily endorsed by Fritz Kuhn . ) Last week Mr. Reynolds ' somewhat poppy eagle eye saw his chance . Down he swooped on the La Follette-Thomas Bill , tacked on an amendment providing that no more than 10% of the employes in any interstate enterprise may be aliens . Caught in a national wave of fifth columny ( see p. 21 ) , the Senate dared not object . Exultant Bob Reynolds then produced his master stroke : <P> " . . . It shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce ... to have in his employ any alien , Communist or member of any Nazi bund organization . ... " Maximum penalty on employers : $10,000 fine ; five years ' imprisonment . <P> Bob La Follette jumped to protest . " I very much dislike even to appear disagreeable , " crooned Bob Reynolds . Reminded that his previous amendment left a few jobs open to aliens , he stripped his prohibition down to employment of Nazis and Communists . A few Senators ventured that under Senator Reynolds ' terms all employers would be suspect , that none could ever be sure of his innocence . Senator Reynolds waved this objection aside , got his unenforceable amendment passed without a recorded vote . The Senate then passed what was left of the La Follette-Thomas Bill , sent the measure on its uncertain way to the House . The La Follette Bill had been smothered in aliens .
