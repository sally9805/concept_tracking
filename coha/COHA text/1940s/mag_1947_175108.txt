ARMY &; NAVY <P> The orders which the American Graves Registration Service gave its 200-man detachment in China were deceptively simple : they were to recover and identify the bodies of U.S. servicemen who had died there during World War II . But few soldiers had ever had a tougher peacetime assignment . Many of China 's 3,700 missing U.S. dead had vanished almost without a clue , lay scattered in remote and inaccessible regions from Manchuria to the hot forests of Thailand . The most dramatic example : the 879 men who had died in the wrecks of 468 different airplanes trying to fly the cloud-hung Himalayan Hump . <P> The A.G.R.S. recovery teams soon found that they had to become rivermen , mountain climbers , explorers , bush diplomats and detectives . A.G.R.S. men , almost one-third of them Chinese-Americans , went out in groups of from three to ten . They traveled by jeep , mule , native pony , oxcart , sampan or on foot , were almost always supplied by air . Some of them headed west of Chungking toward Tibet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others battled leech-ridden jungles and flooded rivers ; one group swam a swollen stream to find the bodies of a B-29 crew , swam back , pushing their grisly burden on a raft . <P> Everywhere the search crews had to go through a slow and painstaking quest for information . Early offers of rewards backfired badly . Bandits dug up bodies , reburied them until sure of being paid , and sometimes claimed reward money for remains which were not those of U.S. soldiers . Most graves were found through the patient questioning of local natives . One body was traced through the discovery of a short-snorter bill , another after quizzing a woman who wore an identification disk as an ornament , several through coolies who were found wearing shirts of parachute nylon . <P> More than a few A.G.R.S. men fell into situations which savored of Terry and the Pirates . Communist detachments held some of them prisoner , in the belief that they were spies for Chiang Kai-shek 's Nationalist forces . One A.G.R.S. team crossed into Indo-China and found a blonde French woman leading a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashed in the Himalayan hills , walked back 350 miles through bandit country . For fear of dysentery they lived entirely on boiled eggs until natives talked them into a meal of fried bees ( which tasted like a cross between meat and nuts ) . <P> By last week the A.G.R.S. detachment in China had recovered the remains of about 2,800 U.S. military dead . But their work , like that of other A.G.R.S. groups who are searching for 17,126 bodies in former theaters of war around the world , was far from done . There were still 876 unrecovered bodies in China , and most were in distant and dangerous country .
