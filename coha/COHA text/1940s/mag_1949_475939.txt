FIFTY-FIVE American writers , led by seven of their number , have produced a comprehensive Literary History of the United States ( Macmillan , 3 vols. $20 ) . The title by its very ambiguity suggests the nature of the attempt : to tell the story of American literature in close alliance with the history of the nation . The succession of great names , ideas , and schools is steadily regarded as an aspect of the entire society , not as the arbitrary pastime of eccentrics , singly or in cliques . Together with this vertical unity of literature and life , the feeling of horizontal continuity is maintained by the editors ' effort to link the eighty-one chapters into a consecutive account . Here is no symposium or set of essays held together by chronology and binding cloth , but a deliberately organized survey of America 's writers and the place of their work in our past and present history . As such the two volumes of text and their bibliographical companion will undoubtedly exert a great though quiet influence . The simplicity and dignity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the agreeable no less than convenient format of the books will bring the work into every sizable library , municipal and collegiate . The authors modestly state in the Preface that every generation must produce a history like theirs , but it may be doubted whether the conjunction of energy and intelligence for a similar undertaking will occur again in so short a span as they predict . Certainly they worked as if they meant their collective judgment to stand weathering , and since its strength and bulk arc bound to mark theminds of at least several student generations , it becomes important to assess its bearing as a whole . For despite seeming indifference to scholarship and belles-lettres , we are intellectually a most docile people . Fifty men write a history ; within a short time seven hundred colleges transmit their ideas ; and pretty soon ten thousand high-school teachers arc conscientiously pushing the portable conclusions into every young mind . In the work before us the weight of scholarly authority is re-enforced by the tangible blessings of three wealthy foundations , so that the book comes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . It is more than likely that the middle-aged citizen of 1980 will spontaneously echo the opinions of the present Big Four : Messrs . Robert Spitler , Willard Thorp , Thomas H. Johnson , and Henry Seidel Canby , assisted by Messrs . Howard Mumford Jones , Dixon Wecter , and Stanley Williams . in forecasting this sequence of awe-inspiring results , I do not mean to imply anything sinister . The Literary History is better than any we have had on this scale . It is thorough . many-sided , and truly written for the general reader . A person , for instance , who had just finished enjoying one of Poe 's tales could on an impulse turn to the appropriate chapter by Mr. F. 0 . Matthiessen and find there much information entertainingly put , precise without scholarly apparatus or irrelevance , extensive enough to whet and satisfy ? in short , popularization in the best sense of the term . Most of the first volume , to which this essay belongs , keeps to this even tenor : the figures are familiar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen to deal with them have usually given us in books of their own the full range of rheir argument . One notes with pleasure in passing a more generous treatment of Oliver Wendell Holmes , Sr. than he has been wont to receive as a writer of prose . But even in this first half of the history , the characteristic shortcomings of the work may be noticed . Trivial as some of them may appear at first ? jargon , a tendency to over-classify , a back-tracking chronology , and a less than irreproachable syntax ? these defects are , I feel , ultimately related to a faulty conception of what literature is , or ? what amounts to the same thing ? a faulty theory and practice of criticism . If this should prove , true , then the very effectiveness of the book is a thing to ' be regretted , since every page of it strengthens a false image ; the better this book is of its kind ? and I have dwelt on its solid merits ? the worse it is for those who read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trouble I CAN put my objection in a word by say-ing that the spirit of Parrington hovers over the text like a ghost on the verge of re-incarnation ? and again by saying that in reading these 1,400 pages one rarely has any inkling that literature is something to love . Certainly our great writers arc not shown as if they had had much passion for it , and most of our fifty-five critics write as if they were above contagion . This is not invariably true , but it tends to be true . Nor do I mean to make Parrington solely responsible , but he has certainly affected our generation through the very channels I indicated above , and his own demonstrable lack of zest Eor the written word has become a genre . He was interested , it may be , in social history , having a retrospective desire for reform , hence he scanned works of art for signs and portents like an ancient augur discussing entrails , so that much of the time even his social sympathy was abstract . Similarly in the present work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history sound perfunctory . One thinks at once of literary history as Saintsbury wrote it ? uneven , prejudiced , andsometimes pedantic , but never by any chance perfunctory . In prejudice and in real pedantry there is ardor , there is the power to discriminate , and there is forward motion , the sum of which manages to convey more reality than we feel in the all-too-estimable work under review . What for instance is one to think of comments such as this : " As a result of a mayoralty campaign in Memphis , Tennessee , in 1909 , in which W. C. Handy , a Negro singer , played a prominent part , the blues began to sweep the country " ? To write in this manner one must have what might be called the musicologist 's touch , e.g. " In 1590 , he ordered the murder of his wife and her lover , after which he composed six books of madrigals . " One may recognize the need for compression , yet feel that when it does violence to one 's sense of cultural causation it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrudes itself : compression is for fullness , but there are various ways of being full , and one of them is to render main subjects in proper scale . Now , volume two takes us from the Civil War to the present and in this span I could find no figure except Henry James actually brought into high relief . Mark Twain never shows up large as life , which is not the fault of Mr. Wecter 's always fluent prose , but the fault of the plan by which major writers are doled out in slices stuck in various contexts . When in the chapter on Humor we find Twain actually slighted in favor of Aldrich and Tarkington , his recovery of stature becomes obviously difficult , and meanwhile a deplorable confusion has taken hold of our minds : the History has lured us into thinking that literary activity is synonymous with Literature . We keep hoping that we shall come to grips not only with Twain , but also with " Mr. Dooley , " Bret Harte , 0 . Henry , Joaquin Miller and others ? not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less men of weight compared to the nonentities that clutter up the foreground : Prentice Mulford , George Horatio Derby , James Lane Allen , and dozens more who fill enumerations and occasionally paragraphs : wherefore Anne Trumbull Slosson , " who reached full stature only with Dumb Foxglove in 1898 " ? All this justifies the fear that the evil fate of American political history has overtaken American literary history , namely , a systematic featurelessness . In the politics of a democracy there may be an excuse for the pretence that the dismal patronage seekers of 1861 were the equal of Lincoln in their effect on the nation 's history , though I am not certain that the endless delight in finding such mole-like influences really adds to our historical awareness ; it may add rather to the number of history Ph.D . ' s while making the nation 's history just so much less graspable . But in literary history I have no doubt that the distinction of merit can not be blurred without erasing the whole subject . This is not to deny the cultural value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amateur , but the gradation , precisely , must be felt : a few very great artists at the top , then the grand company of the first to the fifth rate , and trailing after , the comet 's tail of scribblers . Failing to make these separations clear , our historians perpetually contradict themselves . We have no sooner finished reading the praise of Sarah Orne Jewett than it is thrown overboard to make room for the merits of Mary Wilkins ; Sidney Lanier is credited with high poetic achievement , only to have it fade away as soon as Emily Dickinson comes on the scene . The " minor master " of one page becomes " artificial " and " lacking in technical skill " as the page turns . This changing perspective is in fact the device most often used by our critics to connect their several subjects . It tempts one to quote a sentence of their own about Lowell : " It takes more than a sane and comprehensive conception of literature to make a critic . " Just so : a little concentration instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of insanity would have done wonders for their style and thought . Port of Missing Men Considering that so many harmless bunglers were scooped up for embalming in the Literary History , is was a disappointment not to find the names of two writers who deserved mention and perhaps a bit more . I am thinking of John Jay Chapman and Albert Jay Nock . It strikes me now on seeing their common middle name that they must have been kin through common descent from that elegant writer of colonial days , John jay . In ours his distant offshoots undoubtedly wrote with elegance and both possessed in a high degree the specifically critical qualities . Illustration from Chapman 's work is not in order , but one from Nock is aptly at hand in the Journal of Forgotten Days which has just been posthumously published ( Regnery , $3.50 ) . " A pleasant conversation , " writes Nock on May 17 , /934 , " about the lyric poets of the Restoration . They always interested me by the quality of their verse , and some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sir Charles Sedley were as hard citizens as history makes them out , how did they manage to write such exquisite simple lyrics ; and above all , how did they manage to give them an accent of unimpeachable sincerity and tenderness ? if the tone of high seriousness does not pervade Rochester 's lines to his mistress , then I simply do not know it when I hear it . Probably history judges these erring brothers by the worst they did instead of by the best they could do , or even by a fair conjectural average . When a man speaks himself out in verse as unmistakably as they did , I should call it evidence that at least he has his moments , and that they are rather great moments . " Allowing for this being an extract from a diary , see how complete a critical sample it actually is : it begins with history and biography . describes the literary work and asserts its quality in the form of a personal judgment , and winds up with art allusion to conventional opinion and a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an essay or a book , every sentence of which would be suffused with this same light of intellect charged with feeling and weighted with two sorts of knowledge ? of fact and of tradition . The genuine critic is a critic in everything he says ; he can not choose but take his bearings frequently and report them to us ; he is superconscions , as we may see in Hazlitt , Shaw , Swift , or Stendhal , and hence proportionably alienating , uncomfortable . Yet the critic can not be dispensed with . In any literary culture he functions as the digestive organ , and does this not merely once for each book but all the time for all books , the greatest works being the most indigestible and having to be chewed anew every dozen years for the mentally toothless . The age-old argument against The Critic is therefore misdirected . When a young poet says of him ? as does Miss Barbara Howes in The Undersea Farmer ( The Banyan Press , $2 )  - -  she is right , but her disgusted con-clusion is gratuitous . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's worse , universally declared inedible . The legitimate complaint is of the bad critic , but does he occur more frequently than the had poet ? And is the good poet always at the top of his form ? The self-evident answers suggest that we should coddle critic and poet alike : each a precious rarity . Mr. Nock 's little volume contains many good things other than criticism , but there are neglected essays of his worth reprinting ; and an even greater number by his friend Mr. H. L. Mencken , whose critical work we think we have absorbed : we have n't , any more than we have assimilated the astringent Chapman . American literature needs these peptic minds . Meanwhile , an early work of Mr. Cyril Connolly 's has met with the proper good fortune of reissue . Enemies of Promise ( Macmillan , $4.00 ) is a very funny and very serious discussion of modern fiction , attached to a picturesque fragment of autobiography . As a conscientious critic , Mr. Connolly felt that we must know something of his character before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cate dissection of his youth , corn plete with school miseries and firs Paris visit One takes delight in hi prose while awaiting mit Angst hi graduation from puberty ; but in r trospect one feels that the critica first half of the volume , though seems more cavalier , is really more considered , Perhaps this is only to say that criticism should always be vigorous and witty . Mere " appreciation " is another thing , but the critical passion is not languishing . no matter how much beauty you shovel in its path ; and it is solemn only in brief respites from acting the gadfly . Criticism No Science This leaves but one more outlet for critical energy : the would-he scientific system , a current example of which is provided in Mr. Arthur Koestler 's Insight and Outlook ( Macmillan , $5 ) . It is a work based on much reading and correlation of data in biology , psychology , aesthetics , literature , and the fine arts . Any sketchy account must inevitably do a grave injustice to the quantity of wisdom it holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while I recognize and respect Mr. Koestler 's insight , I resist and repel his outlook . By this I do not mean his desire to establish the common nature of creative activity in science and art alike , but his feeling that this unity of spirit can be proved , or needs to be , by means of definitions , diagrams , psychiatric case histories , and classifications of artistic objects from jokes to Joycian prose . In the course of his laborious effort ? and there is another volume to come ? he seems to me always to be slipping off one facet of the work of art into the deep blue sea . He is ever reducing a quasi-living thing to a single significance . Nothing can he more contrary to the lesson of the two disciplines I hold to be alone reievent : criticism and history . Different observers legitimately find in a given work diverse sets of attributes at the same time , and at different times the prevailing mode changes the object virtually out of recognition . On these points the urbane essays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $3 ) , are very persuasive , the author having much of Mr. Koestler 's purpose at heart but without any hankering after scientific formulas . To create in his own fashion , the critic must speak to the people ; his true business being , as P. G. Hamertou long ago pointed out , to expound Unpopular Truth . Hainerton 's proof was itself simple and full of wit : Popular Truth needs no preaching ; Unpopular Fallacy of course should not he taught ; which leaves ? Unpopular Truth .
