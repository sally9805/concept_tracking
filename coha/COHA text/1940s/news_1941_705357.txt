txt The days are growing warmer and brighter here in Washington . Whether this has anything to do with it we do n't know , but it has become quite apparent during the past few weeks that the Administration is increasingly optimistic both over British chances of winning the war and over the progress being made at home in national rearmament . Please do n't misunderstand . This optimism Is still very restrained and has been kept pretty well under cover during discussion of the lend-lease bill . There is no thought that either the United States or Great Britain is out of the woods  --  or anywhere near it . Perhaps one can say that officials here are at last beginning to feel that the path through these woods of unpreparedness and past defeats is growing broader and that a final Anglo-American victory is in prospect if dogged perseverance and high inspiration cap carry the democracies through the next few months . This upswing of confidence is being fed by a number of sources , among them the continued Anglo-Greek victories , the recent lapse in submarine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war in the United States and , not least of all , the quiet confidence expressed in the latest address of Prime Minister Winston Churchill , whose blunt truths in the past strengthen his statements of today . Increase in Plane Production Of the four factors given above , the only one that can be discussed at length from Washington is the steadily deepening flow of American war equipment , particularly aircraft . After the bitter disappointments of last fall , when previously grandiose predictions as to plane production had fallen through , today 's undeniable upswing in production is doubly heartening . Although no official announcement as to the number of warplanes produced during January has yet been released by the Office of Production Management , it is already known that the figure was not far from 1,000 . Not only is this figure considerably ahead of what was expected on the basis of the revised estimates of last fall , - but it also shows a very decided jump over the ** produced during December . December 's total was , in turn , approximately 100 more than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the past week confidence has been expressed by a number of persons most intimately connected with the production and procurement of aircraft that this rise will not only continue but will be accelerated during the months to come . Not hesitating an instant when asked to assume the role of a prophet , Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson recently predicted with the utmost confidence that America would soon see an enormous increase in airplane output . Backed Up by Knox He was ' seconded in this by his colleague , Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox , who said this week that plane deliveries to the Navy were now ahead of schedule and predicted that the rate of delivery would increase strikingly within a short time . There is , moreover , accumulating evidence that American aircraft is just about equal , if not entirely so , to any now being built . The Italian Government has cited the fact that considerable American equipment is being used by the British in North Africa , while the British themselves have declared that much . of American plane deliveries up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command . Then there is the recent report from Britain of a trial between an . American Curtiss P-40 pursuit plane and the famous British Hurricane fighter , in which the former is said , and by the pilot of the Hurricane himself , to have outstripped the latter . The P-40 is a standard United States air force fighter and is now being produced in quantity at the Curtiss-Wright plant in Buffalo . Passage in the House of the lend-lease measure and the prospect of quick Senate action , with the bill left substantially as desired by the Administration , is a further cause of optimism here . This has been reflected by both President Roosevelt and Wendell L. Willkie , with the former reputedly telling a friend that " I am an optimistic man . I 'll bet it . will be over within a year . " Mr. Willkie , who is generally recognized as knowing a going concern - when he sees one , told the Senate hearings on the lend-lease bill that a British victory waited upon American aid . AU these , and many more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misgivings of last fall . Joseph G. Harrison
