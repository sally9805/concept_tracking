An old military saw : when the U. S. Army begins to fancy itself up with new uniforms , a defense emergency is just around the corner . Two years ago , running true to form , the U. S. Army designed a new blue dress uniform . Later a new regulation prescribed formal uniforms for official social functions after retreat at all posts in the continental U. S. <P> Last week the Army went back to field uniform ( khaki or O. D. ) . Issued at Washington was an order putting the new blues and all other formal uniforms back into moth balls except for one kind of occasion-social functions at the White House .
