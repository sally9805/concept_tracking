On President Roosevelt 's desk this week were at least five different drafts of an executive order setting up a U.S. version of Britain 's Ministry of Economic Warfare . In Washington , where the phrase is already a cliche , three names were mentioned for the Minister 's job : Dean Acheson of the State Department , Deputy Loan Administrator Will Clayton , Brigadier General Russell L. Maxwell , now Administrator of Export Control . Biggest question mark was not whether such an order would be signed , but whether the man who runs it will be given any real power . Even if he is not , the job could affect businessmen throughout the U.S. <P> Two examples of the need for such a job were particularly evident last week : the freezing of Axis assets ( see below ) and various import difficulties such as the coffee situation ( see p. 76 ) . <P> Argument for such a job is that the U.S. is too deeply involved in war to retain the world 's last vestiges of free-market principles . On the domestic front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is annoying to businessmen but not fatal . But in dealing with totalitarian foreign powers , the U.S. needs to confront the world as one power , with one policy and one personnel . <P> At present , export policy is settled by a maze of departments , including State , Treasury , Commerce , as well as several independent agencies . The Maritime Commission has jurisdiction over shipping , Federal Loan Agency over loans to foreign governments , the Agriculture Department over many hemispheric food matters , Treasury Department ( and the Federal Reserve Board ) over foreign funds . Justice Department over aliens . Army and Navy over foreign bases , etc . Each of these departments has a different policy , and there is no effective coordinator except the President . Better-organized foreign governments find many ways to take advantage of this unintegration . <P> First problems the new agency will face : 1 ) Define the U.S. economic front and , if it includes the Hemisphere , implementing a Hemisphere policy . 2 ) Take measures to prevent the Hemisphere 's strategic materials from reaching Axis hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations in Latin America . 4 ) Negotiate for still more air and naval bases . 5 ) Control all foreign trade and financial matters .
