txt The Army told its soldiers throughout the world today exactly how to calculate their chances for immediate demobilization . Combat veterans and fathers will come first among the estimated 1,300,000 who are to return to civilian life this year . At a special press conference at the Pentagon Henry L. Stimson , Secretary of War , and his chief military demobilization planners announced , for the benefit of anxious wives , mothers and fathers , the point values in the demobilization plan under which some of their husbands and sons would be released . All over the world , at noon today , the same information was being made available to the troops . The program provides for issuance to every enlisted man and woman in the Army of what is known as an Adjusted Service Rating Card . ( Officers come under the same general plan , but their release will be governed more closely by military necessity . ) The enlisted men and women will credit themselves with points based on certain service and parenthood factors . All whose total points exceed a definite number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be released as quickly as shipping and processing facilities permit . Interim Scores Established It will be about six weeks before the actual Critical Scores can be computed , as the Army has to fix these scores in relation to the actual number of troops it feels it can discharge safely within the coming year . This will not delay the beginning of demobilization , however , for , in the meantime , an Interim Score of 85 points has been established for . enlisted personnel of the Army Ground , Air and Service Forces , and 44 points for members of the Women 's Army Corps . Here is the official table front which soldiers  --  and their families ? may figure how many points they have toward their return to civilian life : 1 . Service Credit-1 point for each month of Army service since Sept. 16 , 1940 .. This is the same as 12 points a year . 2 . Overseas Credit-1 point for each month served overseas since // Sept. 16 , 1940 . This , too , is the same as 12 points a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each additional award of the following decorations for service performed since Sept. 16 , 1940 : ( a ) Distinguished Service Cross , Legion of Merit , Silver Star , Distinguished Flying Cross , Soldier 's Medal , Bronze Star Medal , Air Medal , Purple Heart and Bronze Service Stars for battle participation . ( b ) Credit will also be given for the following decorations awarded by the Navy Department : Navy Cross , Distinguished Service Medal , Legion of Merit , Silver Star Medal , Distinguished flying Cross , Navy and Marine Corps Medal , Bronze Star Medal , Air Medal and Purple Heart Medal . ( c ) Credit will be given for those Awards and decorations of a forown country which may be accepted and worn under the War Department regulations in effect when the Readjustment Regulations are put in operation . 4 . Parenthood Credit-12 points for each child under 18 years up to a limit of three children . Maj. Gen. William F. Tompkins , director of the Special Planning Division of the War Department Special Staff , which formulated the demobilization plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work : " Let us suppose , " he said , " that a soldier has been in the Army thirty-six months , has served overseas for eighteen months , has won the Silver Star and Purple Heart and participated in three major campaigns , and is the father of a child under 18 . He would receive thirty-six points in service credit , eighteen points in overseas credit , twenty-five points in combat credit and twelve points in parenthood credit , " On the basis of the above table and the Interim Score , a soldier who can count up eighty-five points for himself is reasonably certain of discharge within one year ( any delay will be caused by lack of shipping facilities , not by the Army 's desire to hold him up ) unless he is a man who can not be spared until a qualified replacement is ready . Actually , the critical score will be lower than eighty-five , so that men whose points are close to that figure may rope for discharge . General Tompkins explained that eighty-five was fixed because it allows " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual score would be . What the actual critical score would finally be , however , he would not guess . Special Skills Involved General Tompkins warned that 1where " considerations of military necessity " made it impossible to let a high-score man go immediately , his demobilization would have to be delayed until a qualified replacement was ready . This would apply particularly " to men possessing special skills required in the war against Japan , and to men in units that will have to move into the Pacific so swiftly that no opportunity is provided for replacing men with high scores until they reach the new theatre . " The Army had previously announced that it would reduce its present strength of 8,300,000 to a total of 6,968,000 a year from now . This will be accomplished by releasing about 1,300,000 under the demobilization plan , plus some oth ; ers to be eliminated by other forms of discharges and attrition . Actually , the Army plans to drop 700,000 men through attrition , medical discharges , etc. , in addition to the 1,300,000 , and these 700,000 will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the draft call will be kept up to replace the 700,000 , so , actually , the size of the Army will not sag below 6,968,000 . Maj. Gen. Idwal H. Edwards of the Army 's Training Section cautioned , however , that it might not be correct to assume the draft call would amount to exactly 700,000 in the coming twelve months . It might vary on the basis of future demands , not foreseen now , he stated . The 100,000-a-month draft call for the Army would be kept up during the balance of May and June , although it might be cut in July , both General Edwards and Brig . Gen. R. W. Berry of the Personnel Section agreed . Secretary Stimson said that an effort would be made to bring even more men of the younger-age group into the Army as replacements for those discharged or lost in Pacific combat . Generals Edwards and Berry said that some men above 30 would be taken through June , but that after that the Army would strive at least to fill its needs from the 18 through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharge by virtue of their high scores , men holding the Medal of Honor and men over 42 years of age may be discharged on their own request . Also , married members of the WAC will be released on their own requests if their husbands have been separated from the armed forces and returned to civilian life . Both Secretary Stimson and General Tompkins stressed the point that the demobilization plan had been formulated after troops themselves had been interviewed and polled on what they considered the fairest methods . More than 90 per cent of the men interviewed favored the point system which gave earliest release to combat veterans and fathers , General Tompkins said . The War Department estimates that all except 2 per cent of those to be released will be men who have served overseas , and that the other 2 per cent will be fathers with long Army service . General Tompkins pointed out that it would have been much simpler for the Army to have demobilized entire units , leaving other units to go on to the Pacific war . But this would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and arduous service , so the Army took the more complicated way , he stated .
