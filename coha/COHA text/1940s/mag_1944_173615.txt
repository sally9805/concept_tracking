The six million U.S. farmers took in $19 billion last year . That was $3.5 billion above 1942 and more than twice as good as their $8.5 billion average for the five years 1935-39-This bumper harvest of dollars was partly due to higher prices . For their produce farmers collected about 20% more than they charged in 1942 . At year 's end farm prices had soared to 15% above " parity , " and the ill-famed farm lobby , with nothing much remaining to fight for , was left brooding over new formulas for a bigger and better " parity . " <P> But the farmers ' lush income was not all due to price inflation . Much of it they had earned the hard way , by longer hours of sweat , toil-and some cause for tears . After a wet late spring that brought disastrous floods and killing frosts , they plowed and seeded from sunup to midnight . Some worked by moonlight ; others - rigged up floodlights , or mounted battery-operated searchlights on their tractors . <P> In Iowa Will E. Jacobs , 67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 72 pooled their feeble manpower , collectively worked their 900 acres of farm land . In Minnesota , stocky , soish Oscar Berning and his teen-age son handled all the work on 375 acres . In the year of great need the farmers , despite fatigue and a wartime loss of three and a half million workers , produced 32% more food than they averaged in 1935-39 . <P> The remarkable feature of the 1943 farm income was the sum the farmers managed to carry over to net profits . Despite soaring feed costs and fabulously high wages demanded by the few workers available , the U.S. farmers ' net profits-out of a gross of $19 billion-are estimated at $12.5 billion . This 65% profit ratio scared the economists . With the farmers jingling so much inflationary money in their pockets , some economists fear another runaway land boom . <P> But all the evidence shows the farmers <P> have scant interest in more land . Their <P> dream of a postwar Utopia is less work , <P> fewer acres , more tractors and better housing . For their ticket to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $17.5 billion of demand deposits-almost three times 1940 ' $ $6 billion .
