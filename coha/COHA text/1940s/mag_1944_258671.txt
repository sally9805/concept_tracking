Your correspondent and your photographer Bob Capa drove into Paris with eyes that would not stay dry , and we were no more ashamed of it than were the people who wept as they embraced us . <P> We had spent the night at General Leclerc 's command post , six miles from Paris on the Orleans-Paris road . Here the last German resistance outside Paris was being slowly reduced , while inside the city the Germans and the F.F.I , fought a bitter battle that had already lasted six days . Late in the afternoon a French cub plane flew in 50 yards above the Cathedral of Notre Dame , on the He de la Cite where the F.F.I , had its headquarters , and dropped a message which said simply : " Tomorrow we come .

The tall lovely bending trees that lined the roads and fields stood dark against the sunset .

The Germans held a large circular area bounded by the Eiffel Tower , the Invalides , the Gare du Quai-d'Orsay , the Place de la Concorde , the Madeleine and the Grand Palais .
