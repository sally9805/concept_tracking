txt Lieut . Gen. Ben Lear 's heavily outnumbered and all but defeated Second Army rested tonight after five days of heavy simulated battle which started with initial successes but ended in rout . The respite came when Lieut . Gen. Lesley J. , chief of staff , general headquarters , in charge of maneuvers , called a halt to the first phase yesterday after General Lear 's Red Army had lost its commanding general 's headquarters , and was almost encircled by hard-hitting forces of the Blue Army under Lieut . Gen. Walter Kreugcr . By Joseph C. Harsch Former Berlin Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor now covering Army maneuvers in Louisiana . WITH THE SECOND ARMY IN LOUISIANA , Sept. ** are plenty of new ideas about military tactics in this young American army . A lot of them may not work . But the command is showing initiative and the men are going through the experiments with enormous interest and pride in their work . For example , one night a squad of " Blue , " Third Army , men made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured truck , drove to " Red " GHQ , brushed past unsuspecting sentries , and set off smoke bombs in the vita communications and command rooms , theoretically putting control of the entire Red Army out of action for several hours . The next morning the " blues " landed a company of parachute troops 25 miles down the road . While their landing was drawing the attention of the defending " Red " air force , a squad of " Blue " dive bombers again attacked the " Red " headquarters . Within half an hour a squad of the parachute troops arrived at the back entrance in a captured truck , cajoled sentries. , into believing they were delivering some typewriters , and got inside the building . What is more , they wandered around inside for 10 minutes hunting for Lieut . Gen. Ben Lear , commanding officer of the " Red " army . They did n't catch him . but they did theoretically put another general out of action before they were rounded up . All of which is strictly unorthodox , and might prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not work . But it showed a lot of imagination and a freedom from the old hide-bound customs of warfare under which generals and high commands were considered immune from attack . It is just as new for the American Army as the tiny Bantam cars , the Army calls them " peeps , " which are proving a great success in the field . With four-wheel drive and two gear ranges they can make 60 miles an hour on a highway or go across country over terrain which a motorcycle could not rover . They can be fitted to carry a 3 mm. antitank or antiaircraft gun . They are sq low they can be concealed by a slight rise in the ground . They are cheap and easy to produce , particularly for the Amer-can automobile industry . These " peeps " are so successful that there is a growing tendency to substitute them for motorcycles for everything except quick dispatch work well behind the line . In all probability they will be substituted for motorcycles for advance scouting because of their lower visibility and their ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may prove to be the real answer to tanks . It is a new American device . More encouraging even than the new weapons and tactics is the initiative of the men and their interest in new ideas . The " Blue " parachutists who reached " Red " army headquarters were tremendously keen about their exploit . It was the first time their particular outfit had made a jump in numbers larger than a squad . They did it easily , without accident . After being captured in the headquarters buiing they expressed complete confidence that the trick could be pull0 under field conditions . They bilieve in their outfit , in its value and workability. safety tactics of pilots of 800 planes in the Louisiana war maneuvers in which five airmen have been killed said today the Air Force 's new type bombers have withstood their first tremendous field tests . Included among the new ships tested under simulated war conditions was the B-26 bomber which Robert A. Lovett , Undersecretary of the War Department for Air , has described as the fastest in the world . Army airmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
