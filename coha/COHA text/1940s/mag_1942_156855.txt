Each in its own way , the nation 's 6,443 draft boards are scraping the bottoms of their I-A barrels . Urgently they are tapping other manpower pools , and the time approaches when no man and his employer can find certainty in being over 40 or a father or one-eyed or a skilled craftsman . <P> In San Antonio the boards , overworked like many another and far behind their quotas , had to take one-eyed men , illiterates , expectant fathers , 4-F men with curable defects . Only remaining single men were over 45 , or were farmers or key war-workers deferred only upon recommendation of hard-boiled reviewing boards . Los Angeles , 50% behind quotas , desperately sent for induction almost everybody who could walk , among them a father of eleven children . Worried to sleeplessness were war plants ' personnel managers who had to replace critical workers-in August , September and October , Douglas Aircraft Co. lost 11,000 employes , some of whom took years to develop special skills . <P> About half of San Francisco 's boards expect to draft childless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inducting married men without children , many another with thick glasses , poor hearing , few fingers . Such men can relieve others for duty and up to 30% of them can be repaired for combat by special medical attention . Examples : at one replacement center 18 one-eyed men are mechanics and clerks ; out of a I-B battalion 10% entered officers training schools for administrative jobs . <P> In East Point , Ga. , four firemen and three city council members were called this week for examinations . Without waiting for teenagers , Illinois draft officials started working on registrants with collateral dependents and expected to induct childless married men by Dec. 15 . <P> The Army &; Navy took one step toward making order : the banning of enlistments by essential employes in aircraft and shipbuilding plants . Draft boards and personnel officers advocated two more steps : 1 ) a manpower coordinator to end bureaucratic conflicts ; 2 ) a lengthening of industry 's work week . <P> Emperor Haile Selassie had another way in 1935 when Mussolini 's troops attacked : " Everyone will now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spear will be sent to Addis Ababa . Married men will take their wives to carry food and cook . Those without wives will take any women without husbands . Women with small babies need not go . The blind , those who can not walk or for any reason can not carry a spear , are exempt . Anyone found at home after receipt of this order will be hanged . "
