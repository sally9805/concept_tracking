Standing there in the soft glow of that great orange moon , with the sea pounding a fluid poem against the base of the cliff far below them , he lifted up her face and spoke with his lips almost touching her mouth . " My darlin , " he said , " etaoin shrdlu etaoin shrdlu Readers , look not for the hidden meaning in his words . " Etaoin shrdlu " is the most versatile letter grouping you will not find in the dictionary . It has been used as a proper noun and a very common one , as an adjective , an adverb , and a verb . Yet etaoin shrdlu is nobody and nothing , means nothing and stands for nothing . Like any other meaningless line of type , it is called a pi line , and it appears most often because it is the easiest combination of letters to run off on a typesetting machine . So famous has it become that last summer a designer brought out a popular print dress with the two unpronounceable words all over it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the most unexpected places . That a typesetter makes such gibberish is due to one of the many hazards of getting words into print without distorting them or their meanings , and each of these hazards may cause  | e errors that the trade calls bulls or pos . In the complex process of printing , e-aoin shrdlu has its place , though that place is not in the finished product . To hear writers and editors talk , one might assume that the printer is some sort of extra-inferior cretin who twists the meanings of the written word and is responsible for every mistake in print . As a matter of fact , the most hilarious errors originate with the writer and the editor who corrects and puts heads on the writer 's stories . Ambiguous writing fives unintentional meaning to these heads , which appeared in newspapers : CHRISTMAS SALE OF METHODIST WOMEN To BE HELD TUESDAY PRINDIVILLE TAKES STAND IN UNION SUIT Strictly accurate was this head on a story in the Santa Monica ( Cal . ) Evening Outlook describing a drugstore 's offer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonetheless startling : THRIFTY DRUG PROVIDES BOWL SEATS AT LOW COST Careless writing bas made collectors ' Items of such paragraphs as these : Only one of the old bloc will be missing ? pretty Winifred Stanley of Buffalo . Her seat disappeared in the New York redistricting . The members of St. John Baptist Church met with the pastor in bed . . . and had i lovely meeting ; reports were good ; amount $37.80 . Statements about wearing apparel are especially susceptible to ambiguous iniuendo , and so we have read that : Beautiful costumes were worn till midtight , when lunch was served . Sheer stockings designed for dressy wear . BUT SO SERVICEABLE THAT LOTS OF WOMEN WEAR NOTHING ELSE . Even Eleanor Roosevelt fell into this trap when her newspaper column came out with the questionable declaration , " After supper with the men , we went back to dress . " ILLEGIBLE script was responsible for many errors , but the typewriter , too , can be obscure , as the Fall River ( Mass . ) Herald learned to its dismay when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " How can the student council take an active part in promoting the sex relations ? " When the original story was looked up , it was found that the reporter , Xing out a mistake , had typed , " thesexxx relations . " Dictating to printers , especially over the telephone , is even more dangerous than writing obscurely . Ask the man who ordered a ribbon printed for a funeral wreath and told a literal-minded printer he wanted it to say , " Rest in Peace , " on both sides . That 's what he got ? a ribbon that said , " Rest in Peace on Both Sides . "  | But with everything neatly typed in clear , single-meaning phrases , many awful things still can happen . In the second stage of copy 's journey toward publication , it becomes subject to mechanical as well as human error . The machine that sets most modern printed matter is a delicate and complicated device commonly called a linotype , because it molds a full line at a time on a metal cast , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the original and there are other makes . Least mysterious feature of these automatic typesetters is the keyboard , somewhat resembling a typewriter keyboard , with the main characters arranged like this : e s c v x t h m b z a r f g fi fl o d w k Y i 1 y q ff ffi n u p j w A glance at the first two vertical lines reveals the origin of etaoin shrdlu . The lightest touch , as the compositor slides his finger down them , serves to test his machine or fill a line to be discarded . When the compositor lightly depresses one of these keys , a brass mold of the corresponding letter slides into place . The machine spaces these molds to fill a line evenly . When the line is full , the machine pours molten metal into the molds , cools it , and drops the slug into a rack alongside the keyboard . The machine then redistributes the brass molds into their proper channels , to serve again . A truly wonderful . device , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key wrong on this machine and you must fill the rest of the line , wait for it to drop onto the rack , and throw it away . In the quotation cited at the beginning of this article , the printer dropped the " g " of the word , " darling . " filled the line , then forgot to discard it George Dixon , the Washington columnist , recalls an incident on the Philadelphia Inquirer when a girl reporter was assigned to a story about a kidnaping scare She wrote a poignant piece , which so pleased the city editor that he granted her the priceless thrill of having her name over a story for the first time . Naturally she was first to reach for the paper when it came out ; but to every- , one 's surprise , she dissolved into tears as soon as she saw it . The story of which she had been so proud began , " Where of where is my baby etaoin shrdlu . " Entirely aside from human frailties , the type-setting machine itself , if not maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the following , all of which have appeared in print : It can substitute a letter : Attractive Room ? Everything furnished , Venetian blonds . Dewdrops on freshly blown noses . She had tight bridesmaids at the ceremony . The vast concourse rent the air wir their snouts .

The rain descends with the force of water from a fire horse . Women-girls . . . . No experiences necessary . . . . Night work . Because of a scheduled mixup , reporters for San Francisco and Oakland newspapers were left behind . And it can misplace a space : And them asses ( the masses ) believed him . ALL SUCH mistakes could conceivably be blamed on the machine , which , fortunately for erring operators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed this double error in a story of a bridge disaster could hardly blame his linotype : " The bride collapsed because the girdle slipped and fell . " When the compositor has carried his work to the type bank , or dump , it has survived only half the perils of the press . Often he has set merely part of a story , and , for the sake of speed , other compositors have set the rest . It is assembled in its proper order by means of identifying marks , also called slugs , on each part . If parts of two stories accidentally are put together on the dump , you may find something like this newspaper bawl-up : The Rev. James Thompson , rector of St. Andrew 's Church , preached to a large concourse of people on Sunday last . This was his last sermon . In a few weeks he will bid farewell to his congregation , as his physicians advise him to cross the Atlantic . He exhorted his brethren and sisters , and after offering a devout prayer , took a whim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timothy St. to Johnson and down Benefit St. to College . At this stage of the proceedings , a couple of boys seized him , tied a kettle to his tail ,  | and he again started . A great crowd collected , and for a time there was a gran , , scene of noise , running and confusion . After some trouble he was shot by a policeman . If something like that has n't happened on the dump ? or if it has ? the type is slid onto galleys ( trays ) , proofed on a small ' press , and sent to the make-up table , or , in printers ' jargon , make-up stone , where more awful things can happen to it . It is not until then that the proofreader gets to compare the set-up type with the original story , and order corrections . The sad fact is that on most newspapers there just is n't time to make all the corrections , because the make-up stone is the last step before molds , called matrices , are made of assembled pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be clamped on the presses . The head type frequently is put on the story on the make-up stone , again by means of an identifying slug . If a mistake s made at this point , it may be as arresting as the time a New York newspaper got the head for a shipping list over the obituary column , bringing the deaths into print with the announcement : PASSED THROUGH HELL GATE YESTERDAY . The same thing often happens with pictures . Years ago , in Fort Smith , Ark. , the Mayor 's wife died unfortuitously at the same time a dilapidated ice house was razed , and the mix-up in captions to the local paper left the picture of the deceased lady reposing under the line , OLD EYESORE GONE AT LAST . REGULARLY , it becomes necessary to cut up a story in type to fit into the column . Careless make-up editors sometimes yank off the last paragraph or so , without reading the type , as the ideal news story is written so that it can be cut from the bottom up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But suppose a story is cut , then moved to a different space , where there s room for more type . The make-up man ashes the cut type off the kill bank to restore it , and he sometimes picks up he wrong lines . Papers have printed : A recital of a wedding that concluded ; As this aggregation has an immense amount of stuff to unload , no parade will 3e held . " A personal note , possibly overtruthful about a matron " improving after are operation in St. Joseph Hospital . Ter guests enjoyed this delightful affair . " A notice that " several of the Rev. D. Mudge 's friends called upon him yeserday and after a conversation the unsuspecting pig was seized by the legs ant slid along a beam until he reached the hot-water tank .

The make-up man ha accidentally tacked on the item some type from the marine news , making th story read that while the young woma was in the city , she would be " entertaine at a round of parties and have her bottor scraped . " Everyone who handles type must is careful to keep the lines in their props order . When it is moved around to  | much , or spills and has to be put back hastily , mix-ups like this have happened Mrs. Margaret Rousseau , 21 , related in circuit court some of the reasons she wanted a. divorce from William , 25 . One was that he painted a divorce . wedding picture . She was granted mustache and spectacles on her In an Oakland ( Cal . ) Post-Inquirer obituary , a line or so referring to the newsboy experiences of the deceased dropped out , making it read , " who died last Friday , was buried today on different street corners . " All correctly set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanings by juxtaposition , such as the " reader " that appeared in the Amsterdam ( N. Y. ) News after a story quoting an expectant father , " The baby was due on June 26 . I do n't know why it is n't here . " For QUICK RESULTS , use an Amsterdam News classified ad . Even after the proofreaders have finished and the type has been corrected , the danger is n't past . Many mistakes are made in the corrections themselves , because , to correct even a letter , a whole line must be reset and substituted for the wrong one . These single lines are seldom proofed . So it was n't too surprising when a Southern paper corrected a story that had described a local hero as " a bottlescarred veteran , " only to have it come out as " battle-scared veteran . " After a newspaper page has been molded and it 's too late to do it over , there is only one course left a harassed editor for eliminating an error , He can have the offending word or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is one reason you occasionally see a blank space or a battered word in your paper . If that 's the cause , you may be quite sure it was an extremely offensive error , to force such an extreme . IT IS newspapers ' constant struggle against time that makes them the chief repository of typographical errors . But the typo is an insidious little intruder . which creeps into the slowest of publications , proofreading and rereading notwithstanding . Several editions of the Bible have become collectors ' items because of typographical errors , notably the one variously known as the Devil 's Bible , the Wicked Bible , and the Adulterous Bible , which omitted the third word from the Seventh Commandment , " Thou shalt not commit adultery . " Another is the Vinegar Bible , which . by a misprint , substituted that word for " vineyard . " And still another , printed before 1702 , makes the apt mistake of quoting King David in Psalms 119:161 , as saying , " Printers have persecuted me without a cause . " The original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is remarkable that we encounter as few errors as we do , especially in hurriedly produced newspapers .
