In 1941 as in 1666 catastrophe is British architecture 's opportunity . <P> When congested , slum-ridden London was leveled by the Great Fire , Britain 's greatest architect , Sir Christopher Wren , urged his Government to rebuild it better . But , like many a would-be city planner , Architect Wren ran smack into public apathy . The Wren Plan was dropped and London was rebuilt as slummily as before . Wrote Wren 's son later : <P> " The Practicability of the whole Scheme . . . was at that time demonstrated , and all material objections fully weighed and answered . The only , as it happened , insurmountable difficulty remaining , was the obstinate averseness of a great part of the Citizens to alter the old Properties and to recede from building their Houses again on the old ground and Foundations . . . . By these means the opportunity was lost of making the new City the most magnificent , as well as Commodious for Health and Trade , of any on Earth . . . . " <P> Today forward-looking Britons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great opportunity of rebuilding not only London , but all of urban England , according to a sensible plan . And this time it looks as if something were really going to be done about it . <P> Last spring the British Government 's Ministry of Works &; Buildings got a dynamic boss : dour , violent-tempered Sir John Reith , who took over his new job with formidable enthusiasm . " God Almighty help us ! " bellowed he in his debut speech , " Is this our civilization ? Are we to plan our future cities for future totalitarian wars ? Are we to have reversible signs marked ' Garage ' on one side and ' Air-Raid Shelter ' on the other ? Are we always to have public trenches as well as public lavatories ? Somebody has got to answer that question before we plan our cities . " <P> His main problems are the same as those that confronted Wren : 1 ) public apathy ; 2 ) finance ; 3 ) land and property laws . The first has been solved gratis by the Luftwaffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second has been partly solved by the War Damage Insurance Acts of 1940 , which subjected all building property and working assets in Britain to compulsory insurance . Most property owners can not collect this insurance until after the war . Thus a huge fund , insurance on 6 to 8 billion worth of building property alone , is in the Government 's hand for post-war reconstruction . <P> As for property laws , the speculators who at first bought up bombed sites for a song ( intending to collect handsomely from the planners ) have been stopped . The Government decreed that land taken over for post-war reconstruction should be paid for at rates not exceeding its value as of March 1939 . <P> The Reith blueprint for the future England tackles , among other big problems , the permanent elimination of slum areas-particularly by introduction of balanced industrial mixtures into one-industry towns . Thanks to electric power and speedy transportation it will be possible not only to rebuild England 's existing cities on more spacious lines , but to decentralize whole industries . Meanwhile Reith 's Ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas until the time when its Master Plan could be put into execution .
