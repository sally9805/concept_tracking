Several examples were cited upon questioning regarding results under the new law which allows a jobless person . $2 a week extra for each of his children . A jobless carpenter with 11 children has drawn $47 a week in unemployment compensation from the State of Massachusetts , more than he would be getting if working . Several weeks ago he exhausted his payments , after ' receiving . his maximum of $544 . Similarly , a maintenance man with 10 children was paid jobless insurance of $45 a week . His average weekly wage in the two high quarters amounted to $47 . A welder with nine children got checks of $43 a week from the State . His average weekly earnings had been $43 . Hence he obtained from the State for being out of work 100 per cent of what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &chef; with 10 children received unemployment compensation of $45 ? a week , as against average earnings for the previous year of $50 a week . The carpenter with 11 children . received the biggest weekly check any single individual has obtained in the 1 ' 0 years of unemployment compensation . He got the maxium allowed a jobless worker for himself , $25 a week , ' plus 422 for his children under 18 years . No other unemployed person with as many as 11 children has as yet claimed benefits . Altogether the State paid out of its jobless insurance fund $1 ,  - -  091,204 in dependency allowances from April 1 , 1947 , when the law went into effect , through Dec. 31 . The number of the unemployed receiving extra unemployment compensation for their children was 33,493 . Twenty-two jobless with families of 10 children showed up in the first nine months of dependency allowances . They were paid a total of $4,635 .

When paid by the State while idle as much as when employed , it is said that a man or woman has no incentive to work . Only three states beside Massachusetts and the District of Co- , lumbia grant dependency allowances . The others are Connecticut , Michigan , and Nevada , Connecticut and Nevada limit their payments for children to a total of . $6 , the District of Columbia to $3 . A special commission relative to the employment security law set up by the last legislature has been studying the problem .
