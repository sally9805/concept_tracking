Personal War <P> Sirs : Like too many other busy people , I buy TIME on the newsstands , read it on the run-and consequently miss many issues . I will miss no more . <P> TIME 'S splendid tribute to the American correspondents in China , appearing in the newspapers , first attracted my attention . As a former Far Eastern correspondent who has lived under the Japanese terror , I know and appreciate the danger and the horror of living with the assassin 's gun at one 's back every minute of the day and night . Those correspondents who remained on the front lines of the Sino-Japanese War have long deserved recognition for their services to the American people . <P> Without detracting one whit from the courage and heroism of the American correspondents in Europe today , I would like to point out that Hitler 's war is not a personal war against the U. S. newspaper men in Europe . In Asia , however , the frustrated Japanese war lords blame the American correspondents in Shanghai and elsewhere for their failure to frighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occupied areas . The Japanese and their hirelings are today waging a personal war upon those heroes of the American press-Randall Gould , J. B. Powell , T. H. White , Tillman Durdin , Arch Steele and Hal Abend . <P> After reading TIME 'S advertisement in the papers , I bought my first copy of the magazine in weeks and there I found the most complete , accurate and fair estimate of the true situation in the Orient that I have yet to read in any magazine . <P> EARL H. LEAF <P> New York City <P> Gutteral <P> Sirs : <P> Please let me express to the editors of your Foreign News department my appreciation for the admirable expression contained in the following sentence : " Therefore , some of the sentences of Vichy have had a gutteral German hardness about them TIME , Oct. 28 . " I assume , of course , that this was intentional coining of a new word which certainly hits the nail on the head . <P> WALTER PHILIPPSTHAL <P> Minneapolis , Minn . <P> &gt;It was n't so bad as most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> This is my answer to that unknown Frenchwoman who wrote the letter entitled " Speak to Us " TIME , Oct. 28 : Chere Madame : <P> It is with great emotion that I read your letter in TIME . The sentiments expressed therein go straight to my heart . I am a Frenchwoman who in the afterglow of 1918 married one of those soldiers who came to help us at that time . . . . <P> Like you I listen to every word of the BBC . From my faraway home , I have followed with wonder and despair the events up to and beyond the fall of France . . . .
