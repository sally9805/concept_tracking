It reminds me of another episode in the history of that statue . Many years ago it was discovered that it was far from securely fastened in its lofty position . The Legislature , then in session , debated at length as to what should be done  --  reinforce its underpinnings or remove it to the interior of the building . Charles Hopkins Clark , editor and publisher of The Hartford Courant , in a brief editorial described the situation as follows : " The House and Senate are confronted with the dilemma  --  whether to have a loose woman above them or a fallen one in their midst .
