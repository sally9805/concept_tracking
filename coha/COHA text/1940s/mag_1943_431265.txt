THE impact of San Francisco at war comes like the kick of a big gun to anyone who has n't seen it since Pearl Harbor . Fighting men have taken over the city as did the Vigilantes of old . They have geared its life , colored its streets , inspired its people . Troops , guns , bayonets , motor units , ships , supplies ? on the move . Soldiers , marines , mines , nets , bayonets , barrages , barbed wire ? on guard . " It is absolutely forbidden to cross this line . " " No cameras or field glasses , please . " " Men in uniform ? welcome ! " If for a moment you lose yourself in old smells , sounds , memories , fighter planes come screaming down the skyline and , lifting you right up on your toes , almost clip off the top of the old Ferry Building to remind you that this is 1943 ? and a city at war ! Helmeted , bullet-belted patrols guard every bridgehead , river mouth , slip landing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barren hills . I picked up my camera to catch a barrage balloon rolling drunkenly down a slope , and , at a click , looked up into the nose of a gun pointed down from a ridge that two seconds before had been plain brown scrub . You feel the electric thrill of an area charged with action . You hear the rivet guns and hammer presses of shipyards ; the screech of braked wheels grating on steel rails as oil moves in thousands of tank cars from refineries ; the roar of blast furnaces ; the thunder of Army trucks speeding by under guard ? 10 , 20 , 30 ? filled with soldiers . You see hills being leveled as giant shovels slap at their sides like fly swatters . You see new towns rising from reclaimed swamps and dust holes . You look across fields of barrage balloons suspended awkwardly in midair like tail-heavy sausages . Finally , you look across to the Golden Gate where , against a low sun , a line of blue , heavily burdened ships is slowly steaming out . Threshold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Army 's Western Defense Command and 4th Army , and the Navy 's Western Sea Frontier and 12th Naval District . From here command extends to the whole Western Theater of War . The city 's magnificent , wave-washed Golden Gate is the most strongly fortified spot in America ( page 281 ) . The Navy has here the Mare Island Navy Yard , the new Alameda Naval Air Station , a blimp base , supply depots , drydocks , and training centers . All other activities are subordinated to the moving of troops and supplies , defending the harbor , maintaining port facilities , and supporting new war industries . During the early months of the war San Francisco cleared more military supplies than all other United States ports combined . In peacetime 25,000 replacement troops cleared this port every year to relieve men garrisoned overseas . Today , figures withheld , one can only watch and wonder at their numbers as soldiers in full kit swing onto rows of dark blue ships . Laughing , sweating , swearing , shoving , they pour over gangways and packing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The low basses of the fog horns repeat their monotones on the Bay . The smell of fish and sea rises from the water front . Some of these soldiers have had a few days  | or hours in town . Others , fresh from staging areas , have just pulled off a blacked-out train . Only a few familiar objects tell them where they are . Nothing tells them where they are going . For the thousands of men who pass through that Golden Gate , it is their last glimpse of America for many months ; it holds all their parting memories . For these men , and the thousands of families , sweethearts , and friends who are here because of them , San Francisco has a tradition to maintain , and she knows her job . Some of the greatest names in Army history have passed this way . Generals Phil Sheridan , William Tecumseh Sherman , Winfield Scott , Albert Sidney Johnston , and John J. Pershing have commanded here . Today , under the able General John L. DeWitt , San Francisco 's military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lies the Enemy Here as strongly as in any other place in America people are aware of what defeat by Japan could mean and they are ready for any emergency . You get the sense of this , and of the confidence behind it , as you travel from the big guns of the coastal defense , across the tallest bridge in the world , and drop down over old Fort Point into the Presidio , largest military post in the United States built entirely within the limits of a city . In normal times the Presidio lies in quiet , parklike detachment , with the Pacific curling in great white waves at its feet . But now it bristles with war activity . On a bouncing , bounding jeep we drove from one barricaded extremity to the other . On every parade ground , in every available clearing , clusters of men were drilling , exercising , holding bayonet practice on rows of stuffed dummies , or running over Commando obstacle courses . We roared down to the " Old Fort , " or Fort Point , sequestered beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Civil War casemates which once mounted 10-inch columbiads ( and never fired a hostile shot ) , we watched the return of the busy fishing fleet which each day comes and goes grandly under naval escort ( page 288 ) . We went by hospital buildings , once a bright yellow . Up and down hills past historic guns and live ones . At each crossing sentries appeared out of the mist to ask for identification . Through shady eucalyptus and cypress and along green parade grounds today there is a constant thunder of trucks , troop lorries , armored scout cars , jeeps , and prime-movers : an endless coming and going of more soldierthan the Presidio has ever seen at one time in all its long , romantic history . Coast Artillery on Guard The security of San Francisco lies in the hands of the Coast Artillery , whose Harbor Defense headquarters are at Fort Winfield Scott , on the bluff overlooking the Golden Gate . The defenses themselves are distributed about the Bay among Forts Scott , Barry . Baker , Funston , Miley , and Cronkhite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The solid San Franciscans who weather the foggy season to live out over the Pacific today see only sand dunes , sleeping brown hills , and quiet cypressed coves . Clumps of brush that used to fire 12-inch batteries in routine maneuvers sway in an afternoon breeze . Rocks that belched flame and smoke lie peaceful under a warm sun . Silent ridges , empty beaches , and bleak cliffs show no life but a few white gulls floating lazily to and fro . They watch the fog roll in , night fall . The coast turns black and silent . Combers break over the shore , but no other sound is heard as barren hills and shorelines settle in for a lonely watch . As huge guns point out to sea , night stations are manned , and men fall back to watching and waiting ! One black , moonless night Coast Artillery officers took me to a coastal gun emplacemen , where I could stand on an unnamed bluff in some near-by rolling hills and sense the magnitude of San Francisco 's Harbor Defenses . We drove in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a deserted road . At a given point the driver snapped off the headlights , and we began to wind over miles of dark , silent hills . It was like a spy film . Or like spiraling slowly down the black insides of a gun barrel . Not a movement , not a sound in all those vast reaches of gloom . A light would flicker for a second away off , then go out . Suddenly , from out of the blackness a voice would ring out : " Halt ! Who 's there ? . . . Advance and be recognized ! " In the darkness ahead I could barely make out soldiers in great-coats and heavy helmets with their guns leveled at us . An officer would jump out of the car , take a certain number of steps , and a soldier would bark , " Halt ! " He halted . ( Three men did n't once . ) The password was given ? " Holy Bible " or something ( it is changed every few hours ) ? and identification was established . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on for a bit , and then go through the whole thing again . A Strange Life Underground Eventually we reached a blacked-out headquarters and dismounted . Through the face of rocks we entered a strange troglodyte world of life underground . Past storerooms , barracks , offices , kitchens , refrigerators , guns ; through countless passages we made our way . Suddenly we were out again in the night air . It was blacker than ever now . We began to work single file up the hill . We climbed over narrow catwalks between camouflaged nets , up steps cut in the side of the hill , through brush , over paths that I 'm sure did not exist . Field mice scattered from underfoot , rustling off as if through straw . I clung to the coat ahead of me and prayed I would n't slip and fall through a net and set off an alarm . that would put the whole harbor defense in action . We crawled through damp 3-foot-square tunnels revetted and lined with burlap . I was handed a phone and told to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard an amused , " Very good , sir ? a ? ma'am ! " Finally we reached a lookout station which , after all that climb , you had to drop down into . There was the choice of swinging down by rope or using a hatch ladder . I used the ladder ! Here in a dugout no bigger than a dinette we found officers and men , desks and bunks , a complicated communications board , and powerful telescopic equipment .  | The guard was being changed . The quarters were small , and there were several of us , but there was no confusion . Everything had a place , and movement seemed easy as men swung up the ladder and out into the night . Back in the underground city , we explored more channels and more quarters . Soldiers would look up and smile as we walked over the concrete floors . An officer glanced at my heels and said , " That 's a sound we do n't often hear around here . " We went along from room to room watching the soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These men were trained regulars . Some of them had had no furlough in two and three years . The boy who drove us through the blackedout hills had been in the Hawaiian Islands for two years and , starting home for leave , had reached the mainland just as war was declared . Another who had not seen his family in four years requested three days to meet them in Sacramento , where they had just arrived from the Midwest . When asked why he had n't applied for any before , he said , " I have n't needed it , sir . " Surrounding gun batteries and antiaircraft units of the Coast Artillery are giant searchlights of 800,000,000 candlepower . These are familiar sights to shore dwellers in San Francisco . Many times we watched coastal searchlights play back and forth , but only for split seconds at a time . Once , from out of the huge girders of the bridge , a beam flashed on , shot out to sea , past Mile Rocks , picked up a small craft , held it a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identification .  | Fanned out from antiaircraft positions are ground observers who , in covering a battery of , say , four guns may throw out 100 miles of telephone wire . The work of these men has been augmented by the civilian volunteers of the Aircraft Warning Service , which operates under the Army Air Forces . The Utility of " Pips " " What are those ? " " Pips . " I looked down again at the tiny rocketshaped markers on the table below . A girl tossed one up to the balcony where we stood behind a row of telephones in the " filter " room at an Air Forces interception headquarters . As an officer of the 4th Fighter Command caught it , he explained , " Pips . They give preliminary information on a flight as it is reported in from a civilian observation post . " When it proves to be more than just a local flight , say in training practice , the information is filtered through to the main operations room . " In the " Ops " room a larger table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by soldiers and women with long wooden sticks . Like croupiers at a gaming table , they pushed in or raked out small " target stands " covered with plastic flags ( page 289 ) .  | In a glassed-in balcony sat liaison officers of the Army , Navy , and Civil Aeronautics Administration . They identify all scheduled flights and get clearance for everything reported in the air . Here , too , sits the commanding officer , or " controller , " who , upon receipt of the flash , " Unidentified Planes , " may order up an interceptor squadron and put the 4th Fighter Command in action . " And those others ? " I indicated the group seated on the far end of the balcony . " Liaison officers of the Antiaircraft Artillery , Federal Communications Commission , and Civilian Defense . When the alert is given , the AA prepares for action . The C.A.A . may ground all commercial flights in the area . The F.C.C. orders radio stations off the air . The Civilian Defense officer alerts CD headquarters . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interceptor force is probably up there , and identification made . If not , the alert goes to an alarm . Traffic is stopped on the bridges , certain industries are halted , Civilian Defense swings into action , and more planes take the air . " When the unidentified aircraft reach 50 miles offshore , that means the warning ? and blackout . The signals have gone through yellow , blue , and are now flashing red in every information or control center of every branch of the combined military and civilian services . " There are no practice blackouts in San Francisco . When the sirens wail , it means " Unidentified Planes ! " ? and business . " All Clear " drops things back to routine , and an explanation goes out . News releases  | from Army headquarters here are sent out over a single line which connects directly with the metropolitan newspapers , the wire services , and the radio networks . One ring on an oldfashioned wall phone automatically plugs them all in so that they receive a report simultaneously . Figures may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aircraft Warning Service , but of the spotters alone there are well over a million in the United States . California has tens of thousands and a big percentage of these are stationed in the Bay area . Mare Island Remembers Farragut ? and Pearl Harbor ! The Service was organized in this area in August , 1941 , and was to be tried out in the war games scheduled for December 11-14 . For the first time in American military history civilians were to become cooperating participants in U. S. Army war maneuvers . When the war broke , the whole thing went into actual operation , and has been functioning without a hitch ever since . But the San Francisco Bay area does n't belong entirely to the Army . Mare Island was the first spot in America to get the news about Pearl Harbor . With its powerful radio station it intercepted Kimmel 's historic message to the Pacific Fleet which ended with " This is no drill . " The news was flashed to Washington and read to President Roosevelt by Secretary Knox before an official communique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaw limped home from the attack , Mare Island gave it a new nose and sent it back to fight ( page 296 ) . When from 500 to 600 Pearl Harbor wounded arrived on Christmas Day , 1941 , Mare Island went to work patching up their hurts and has already discharged 99 percent  | of them . It is still mending ships and men , and turning out new ships besides . The first commandant of the Mare Island Navy Yard was Admiral David G. Farragut who damned the torpedoes . More than 38,000 men and women at Mare Island are at this moment passing his words down the line . A medley of unholy discords rises from the shipyards , machine shops , drydocks , warehouses , and other centers of shipbuilding and ship-repair activity on this small Manhattanlike island in the north end of the Bay . Shipfitters , pattern makers , molders , painters , flange turners , electricians mill about in purposeful confusion , eventually losing themselves in the crushing crowds of a changing shift . Sprinkled throughout the thousands of civilian workers are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital to recreation center , destroyer to corvette , ship to shore . Ordinarily about seven or eight thousand people are employed here . It is the largest naval construction yard in the West . The extra 30,000 or so have charted a production curve which is almost vertical . Besides the construction and repair of naval vessels , merchant ships are being converted to war use ? cargoes to refrigerator ships , and liners to cargoes . We drove up to a channel dock and stepped out to look at a damaged submarine in from the sea . It lay there like a wounded lizard baking in the sun . Rust and camouflage were practically indistinguishable . Dirt and scrap lay over her topside . There was a gaping hole in the stern which looked sickening , but they said it had been shut off by compartmentation and the ship returned under her own steam . Lined up in wooden cradles in another section were the half-formed shapes of escort vessels for both the United States and Great Britain . In other precise rows were corvettes , tenders , destroyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . What construction has n't done , camouflage has . Bomb shelters cover the island , and on every turn you see the poison-gas attack warning signals ? iron-bar triangles to be rung like the dinner gongs used in old mining and lumber camps . The shipfitter 's shop with a crew of 10,000 is the largest in the United States . Here and in the machine shops we found girls and grayhaired women in bluejeans and bandannas bending over lathes of all sizes . Men were picking up hot slabs of steel with long pincers and tossing them across a passageway for cooling . Huge blocks of red-hot metal were being smashed with 2,000-ton drop hammers and taking new shape as if they were wax . The screaming of giant planers followed by the rattling of rivet guns sounded like fighter planes pulling out of power dives with all machine guns hammering . The noise was deafening ? but its vibrating strength was magnificent . In their overalls and goggles the shipyard women look rough , but they are doing a job . Their talk has tang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates with acid to eliminate rust and scale : " counterbore " is a form of drilling , not something you do over a bridge table : and they do n't eat a " rabbet , " they calk it . Three hundred special buses carry thousands of Mare Island workers to and from the mainland and neighboring Bay cities . Workers commute from as far away as Sacramento and San Jose . Noncommuters are ho , used in barracks and emergency dwellings sprawled all over the dusty hills surrounding Vallejo . Rows and rows of new buildings file up and down the undulating landscape . They look like cookie boxes with holes punched in them . On sidings , in special clearings , behind billboards ? wherever room can be found trailers are bunched together like frightened beetles . Vallejo , " The Naval City , " and Richmond , with its petroleum industry and shipyards , have caught the main overflow of new war worker residents . Normal suburban towns before the emergency , they now operate on a stepped-up 24-hour schedule . Rippling rayon banners around movie houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties by the shift . Bands frequently begin to play at five and six o'clock in the morning . Old sections of Vallejo 's main street , usually quiet at night , now twinkle with lights and entertainment . Jeeps piled high with sailors and soldiers go roaring up the street , as civilians crowd and cheer and try to get on , too . New restaurants and hot-dog stands along the highway advertise the boom . We passed the " Hunk-a-dory " somewhere along the way . Berth of the " Flying Navy " In 1938 the United States had seven naval air stations handling the maintenance and overhaul of our Navy 's heavier-than-air craft . Today there are many more than 20 . One of the largest of these new bases is the Alameda Naval Air Station , directly across the Bay from San Francisco . Called the " shore hope " of many Navy officers , it spreads out like an architect 's dream with stream- lined barracks , mess halls , theater , recreation centers , and dispensary . Here , too , is located one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runways , hangars , machine shops , and training schools ( page 297 ) . We saw endless lines of boys in work blues and sailor dinks marching along with notebooks . Winging off over the breakwater was a magnificent Sikorsky amphibian which had just left its wake in a burst of foam . Aircraft of all types were in constant motion here . And along one hangar alley we saw also some planes from Pearl Harbor which had been returned for scrap . They looked like broken butterflies raked up on a garden path . Farther on was the control tower in its green-glassed , war-painted modernism . Regulation , too , were weather instruments and radio units . Naval aircraft support the most powerful radio equipment yet devised . Naval aviation radio operators used to be trained aboard ship . Today the Alameda , San Diego , Seattle , and Jacksonville Air Stations all include aircraft radio study in their training schools . Students who graduate from these schools and complete their indoctrination training are called " qualair . " Following a marching line of sailors to the mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Steaming hot , twenty 80-gallon soup coppers were lined up along the center of the room ; a chef was stirring one with an oar . " Court of Pacifica " Seems Ironic Now Huge refrigerator rooms held mountains of vegetables , fruits , and dairy products . In the bakery , which also is a training school , we saw part of the 750 pies and 1,500 loaves of bread turned out daily . In the Navy , incidentally , bread is not eaten fresh and warm  | the first day ; it is put in closets for 24 hours . Across Treasure Island 's " Court of Pacifica , " where lights once played on a dancing fountain and melody drifted from a screen of stars , bluejackets now march to gunnery practice or patrol duty . " Pacifica , " raised in tribute to the peace and comity of Pacific nations , looks down on strange goings-on these days , for Treasure Island is today an active unit of the Navy 's war program . Based here are naval patrol forces , a large boot camp for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , while awaiting assignment to merchant ships , devotes its time to signal study and gunnery tactics . In the former Science Building of the Fair we found sailors straddling small two-man benches taking code . The original Administration Building houses Naval Headquarters and the offices of Pan American Airways ; the Hall of Air Transportation is Pan Am 's hangar ; and the Palace of Fine Arts is the Navy machine shop . The mess hall here is now the biggest in the Navy . An average of 6,000 men can be fed in 40 minutes . They get all the milk they can drink , and that week it was 25,000 gallons . Besides mine sweepers , patrol boats , and other business units , we discovered two famous craft lying off Treasure Island . On one side , swarming with sailors hard at work putting her in shape for a naval training ship , was the schooner Zaca , Templeton Crocker 's handsome two-master on which Dr. William Beebe made his two scientific expeditions along the American Pacific coast in tropical zoological research . And on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heart ship of Pan American Airways . She was wearing her wound stripe , won in the escape from Midway , December 7 , 1941 , proudly over her port bow ( page 302 ) . Schedules are secret these days , but the  | thrill of watching for the Pacific Clippers is still in the heart of everyone in the Bay area . There is always traffic confusion on the Bay Bridge when one of the big ships comes winging over the towers , or another guns for one of its magnificent take-offs just below . These main naval bases form only a part of the Navy 's story out here . There remain all the things which make up the spirit of San Francisco 's naval tradition : the movement of warships on the Bay and along " Battleship Row , " the blimps on their coastal beats , the flights of naval aircraft , the numbers of men on duty here , and the stories ? those tall , fantastic tales which come straight from the Pacific front as men reach the mainland for the first time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legend of the naval hospitals which can be told only in very small measure at present . At one base hospital we saw men who had gone through a few of the less glorious phases of battle . These were ones whose stories are not told because there is nothing to tell . They simply fought until they fell or were thrown into a sea of burning oil ( page 299 ) . We walked down the long wards , stopping here and there to ask a man his name and home town . We saw men from all parts of the Pacific ? the bat tles of Java , the Coral Sea , Australia , Midway . The stories we have read of their exploits have seemed so incred ible and distant , that meeting them here was like coming face to face with characters you had grown to know in fiction . One of the men was from the U. S. S. Peary , the destroyer which escaped the Philippines , hid by day under green branches near tropical isles , reached the Java Sea just in time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , contracted malaria on board . and finally reached Darwin , where it was bombed in a raid . The seaman showed us his hands where new skin had been grafted over the burns he had received while sliding down a rope to safety . We stood by the bed of a boy named Ban nowsky from Ballinger , Texas , who was still a little groggy from an operation earlier in the day . He was a chief aviation pilot shot down off Soerabaja in the battle of Java . When his ship crashed , the Japs bombed him  | in the water and he was hit by shrapnel . A Netherlands doctor operated on him , then sent him home for special treatment . The Navy doctors told also of the tail gunner who went down 40 miles off Australia . He stayed in the water eight hours with a broken leg before he was picked up by an ammunition ship . When that was bombed he got on a rubber raft and waited for 30 more hours until a destroyer picked him up and put him off on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited a week , and it finally returned to take him to Australia . There he was put in a plaster cast and started for home . For 70 days his ship zigzagged along a strange route without sight of another ship of any kind . When he arrived at the base hospital here , he was completely healed . After a week 's rest , he started back . Boys from the Yorktown had just come in , bringing the story of her fight for life . They talked proudly but with heavy hearts . They had loved that ship , as only men of the sea know how . Chinatown Since Pearl Harbor San Francisco 's crowded Chinatown has changed since Pearl Harbor . On the surface this is hardly noticeable , except for the empty stores of the Japanese who had " infiltrated . " The same old scents of musty sandalwood and potent perfume still waft from ornate , lacquered doors . The clacking of the abacus where accounts are being added ; the windows filled with carved teak and ivory , silks and jade , candied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops of incredible variety and aroma ; little Chinese women in black trousers and soft slippers ; old men in skullcaps and long coats ? all these remain . But underneath the old familiar scenes there have been far-reaching changes . Traditions have gone overboard with the rise of a new wartime generation . Some six thousand men have left their old jobs in Chinatown to go into shipyards . Being a race of craftsmen with small agile hands , they have taken to precision-tool work as ducks to water . As for the armed services , more than three thousand boys from Chinatown have either been called up or have enlisted , and about three-fourths of the colony 's doctors and dentists are on their way .  | In the crypt of Grace Cathedral , the loudspeaking and electrical systems were contributed and installed by Chinese volunteers . Yet of all the war workers in Chinatown none is more colorful than Dr. Margaret Chung , the colony 's most famous woman physician and first doctor for the Grace Cathedral unit . An aviation enthusiast , Dr. Chung is the founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or as she calls them , her " Fairhaired Bastards . " It may be 561 by now . Some flyer may have gone through San Francisco , been recognized by " Mom , " received his green jade Buddha , and gone off to fly for freedom . The 560 represent all the air services of the United States ? Army Air Forces , Navy Air Arm , and the big commercial lines . Dr. Chung gives them numbers as she adopts them ? No. 408 , No. 409 , etc . " Where are they ? " repeats Dr. Chung . " They are wherever men are flying and fighting for freedom . " From all over the world come souvenirs for " Mom 's " Trophy Room , just off her redlacquered office ( page 301 ) . A wing tip , a strip of fuselage , a huge prop  | shaft , photographs from far corners of the earth where " Fair-haired Sons " are stationed for the duration ? all are placed here in a confusion of wreckage . Over in the corner is the control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her boys over the English Channel ; next to it some trophy from an A. V. G. Flags , pennants , insignia cover the walls . Here is a piece of shrapnel from a Jap plane which landed on the U. S. S. Astoria in the Coral Sea battle and was sent in by Rear Admiral W. W. Smith , Bastard No. 52 , who watched it fall . When Lt. Comdr . " Red " Gill , No. 4 , slid off the Lexington just before it went down in the Coral Sea , he automatically grabbed a couple of things that happened to be handy to stuff in his pockets . When he reached land , he sent them on to " Mom . " " Mom " had already read about them . They were the now famous cans of Spam and Planters Peanuts . Dented and battered from concussion , they look very much at home among the tattered trophies of the Bastard Room . Most thrilling of all recent souvenirs , however , is a flimsy piece of red tin , which does n't  | look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : " The setting of the Rising Sun , emblem from the first Jap plane shot down at Pearl Harbor on the morning of December 7 , 1941 .

" One day recently a message came through from a boy of hers in the Far East who had avenged a few of the losses in her ranks . It said simply , " 7 for them . 7 for you . " Most colorful corner in Chinatown today is at California and Grant , where the large three-story establishment of S. Matsumoto , famous Japanese importer , long stood empty and gaunt . Directly to the rear is tiny , quarterblock St. Mary 's Park with its shining statue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen . Diagonally across from the old Matsumoto store is busy Cathay House , where , in a glassed-in kitchen , you may watch Chinese wizards dream up Hop To Gai Kow ( boneless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( squab with select bird 's nest ) , or delectable Or Doong Goo Opp ( steamed duck with orange peel ) . Then directly across from both institutions rises fire-scarred St. Mary 's Cathedral , where Americans and Chinese move in unending little clusters through its huge doors . The gold inscription on the Cathedral facade which looks down on this crossroads of many thoughts and peoples reads , " Son , observe the time and fly from evil . " Before their evacuation the Japanese in the San Francisco area were found mainly in the big shipping lines , in banking , in the exportimport business . They had nurseries , truck farms , goldfish and marine-plant aquariums . They were merchants , photographers , gardeners , house servants .  | They played an extravagant role in the business of shipping out an annual $16,000,000 worth of cut flowers . But they did not fish ! This is one of the strangest circumstances in their relations with the city , and nobody seems to know the answer . The larger fishing craft down along the water front were owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese owned fishing boats , and few , if any , were employed on them . Italians Loyal to U. S. A. International colonies have been part of San Francisco since the first windjammers raked in through the Golden Gate . It does not surprise a San Franciscan even now to turn his radio to an Italian program and hear men of an enemy tongue selling bonds for American defense . Now that alien restrictions have been lifted , the Italian colony goes on its normal ItaloAmericano way , hoping the war will end as soon as possible so it can get on with its fishing ? and send money home to the " poor ones who have been so misled . " The impassioned loyalty of many local Italian leaders to the war cause has made a good impression on the city . They have worked unsparingly to see that there would be no doubt as to the sympathies of their people . War work , hospitality work , volunteer service work , and a wartime city at play have made changes in San Francisco 's old way of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government in its decentralization plan has sent many important war boards and agencies to this area . Bring in 250,000 people as a resident war population , and watch the natives warm up for action . Tell the tourist to " See California AFTER the War ! " and notice the transformation in a land which in  | one year absorbed $200,000,000 in transient trade . The problem now is to keep everyone away from San Francisco who has n't a direct connection with the war effort . Railroads plead with people not to waste space , not to expect the usual service , not to come at all unless they have to . Change and no change . San Francisco is the same enchanting thing it ever was . Panorama from Telegraph Hill Stand on Telegraph Hill , from where , when the city was young , men used to semaphore the approach of a ship through the Golden Gate .

The water front sends up its full aroma of steaming lobsters and frying bass or sole . A hundred corner stands waft the fragrance of gardenias . The salty draughts of sea air mix with the scent of eucalyptus from the hills . Here is the same tradition of things well done . Excellent food exquisitely served : symphony , concert , and opera beautifully produced ; museums and art galleries unchanged by war measures , only more crowded , more alive . Physical changes tell mainly of military restrictions . No more Embarcadero for the civilian : no more the disorganized congress of freight trains , trucks , vans , taxies whirling in confusion along the water front . No more Kodachroming red lobsters , pink shrimps , and bronzed fisherfolk along Fisherman 's Wharf . p 300 No pictures of bridges , buildings , skylines , communications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No driving out through the Presidio along El Camino del Mar to the Palace of the Legion of Honor ; you go by way of town now , perhaps past Sea Cliff with its beautiful homes boarded up or blacked-out , or frequently " For Sale . " No sitting in a window at the Cliff House watching the moonlight play on huge waves breaking against Seal Rocks . By Army proclamation everything visible from the sea has been totally blacked out and every bright light for 150 miles inland has been dimmed . Street lights are painted black on the top and seaward sides . From San Francisco you can scarcely make out where the city of Berkeley lies across the Bay . Crescents of metal shield the orange sodium-vapor lights strung like amber beads above the bridges . Beach concessions look ghostly in their abandonment , and still worse , the huge Ferris wheel moves around silently without lights ! At night barely a handful of cars , their lights dimmed to less than an eightieth of their normal strength , fumbles along that magnificent shore highway . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless you join the spirited crowds and forget the past . In a city famous for its luminous fog-banked brilliance , the Army dimout has worked some eerie changes . " Let 's Keep This War Moving ! " Take a trolley out Market Street . Hang on , because there are lots of them , and four abreast , and they have a job to do . The conductor may be a girl ; there are dozens of them and hundreds more in training for these jobs . If it is n't a girl , it will be one of the old crew whose disregard of rank or station is a San Francisco fable .  | " Climb on , kids , " said one to two grayhaired Navy captains , " let 's keep this war moving . " Look for the old Bank of America Building on the way . It has been converted into a penny arcade . " Fun Center " says the large sign swinging out from its classic , pillared front . You 'll catch a glimpse of soldiers , marines , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polished boots milling through the concessions ; British and American sailors , arm in arm , having their picture snapped in front of a cardboard battlewagon with a cardboard girl in a hula skirt . A New Barbary Coast The old Barbary Coast has come back to life . But now it is the " International Settlement . " Ray and Bee Goman 's " Gay Nineties , " with its East Lynne atmosphere of red plush and gilt , plays to packed houses . In the same row , one club is an old mining-town saloon , one is prewar Paris , and one is The Hurricane . " South Seas and Hawaiian themes are always the favorites out here . You ca n't pass many blocks without seeing bamboo and coconut trees behind a city door . The San Franciscan is at heart a Bohemian . Though engrossed in his wartime work , he will seize every opportunity to enjoy the savor of life ? to watch the passing show . He can , and does , still dine in the tradition of almost any country . As whim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrimps at Fisherman 's Wharf , then cross the Bay to Trader Vic 's for a Tiara Tahiti and sweet-andsour spareribs served in a Polynesian bamboo garden . He may stand on a quiet street and listen to the familiar whir of cables running under his feet ? or travel by one of them to the top of a steep hill just to watch the rippling pano- rama of the city swaying under its myriad banners . Here flags fly from the tops of buildings more often than from the fronts . The land of constant breezes keeps them always unfurled . The San Franciscan who knows and loves these things may still listen for the evening Angelus or the noon bells from St. Patrick 's ; but now the chimes which once played only religious hymns ring out with " From the Halls of Montezuma . " A Water Front Geared to War He may drive out to Coit Tower for the exhilarating view of sea and bay . But instead of looking down on a yacht basin preparing for a regatta , he sees a water front charged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-possessed ships plying a bay that is restless , fitful , wary of the strange things that have been done to her , the strange nets strung over her , the strange craft that ride her . He looks up to see a sharp , startling skyline suddenly fade into the softness of a tulled fog , a shaft of sunlight break through the white bank and strike down to great blue warships lying motionless on a gray bay . He sees the contrast of peace and war . Yet these are but the froth and sparkle and battle raiment of San Francisco at war . It is the deeper spirit of the city which defies definition and is the real birthright of her sons . It is the very greatness of her that has caused the West and the Far East , perhaps the whole world , to look this way and wonder what will happen to Fremont 's beautiful " Chrysopylae " ? to this Golden Gate which has always been the symbol of the Setting Sun .  |           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
