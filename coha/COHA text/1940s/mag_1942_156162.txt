Hollywood wiseacres sometimes call the sonorous roll of an elite society known as the R.K.O. Alumni Association , for R.K.O has let more talent slip through its fingers than it has kept . Examples : David Selznick ( now de facto head of United Artists ) , William Le Baron ( now sparking 20th-century Fox ) , Sam Briskin ( who has helped put Columbia into the big money ) , Joan Fontaine ( whom R.K.O. once had for practically nothing a week-as Hollywood salaries go-but had to borrow back last year at $75,000 for Suspicion ) , Katharine Hepburn , Jack Oakie , ired Astaire , Ginger Rogers. * <P> Last week R.K.O. had a new alumnus : its president , George Schaefer. ex-general manager of United Artists , ex-sales vice president of Paramount , resigned . Mr. Schaefer was pushed into R.K.O. in 1938 by Rockefeller Center ( alias Nelson Rockefeller ) and R.C.A. ( alias David Sarnoff ) , which were both stuck with large R.K.O. holdings . The choice of a salesman to lick production and financial problems roused grave misgivings in Floyd Odium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in R.K.O. stock too , and Mr. Odium turned out to be right : the studio mess at R.K.O. was too much for able Salesman Schaefer . <P> For the first 13 weeks of this year , R.K.O. 's consolidated net earnings were only $439,000 v. $643,000 last year . For a while there was only one picture in production-and a huge operation like R.K.O. needs much more than that to stay in the black . In fact , R.K.O. is scraping the bottom of the barrel again , and Mr. Odium , who got it out of receivership in 1939 was out looking for a $3,000,000 working-capital loan ( which he will probably get from New York City 's Manufacturers Trust Co. - provided he guarantees it ) . <P> R.K.O. 's troubles are all the more obvious when contrasted with the rest of the industry , which is coining money , and even mild Floyd Odium was ready to put up a fight if need be to get a new management . In the past few months he has been pouring good money into R.K.O. , has bought incontestable control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $8,500,000 . <P> But by last week nobody on the Rockefeller side of the fence had any fight left anyway . From now on R.K.O. will sink or swim at Floyd Odium 's orders . <P> <P> *Loyal Ginger still has a three-year contract to give R.K.O. one picture a year , in gratitude for the early build-up R.K.O. gave her .
