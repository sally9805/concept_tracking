Rebecca ( United Artists ) . From beyond the grave dead Rebecca de Winter dominates the lives of her husband and his second wife as Manderley , the de Winters ' rambling Tudor stronghold , dominates the misty Cornish coast . Beyond there is always the sea to which Manderley 's weird housekeeper , Mrs. Danvers , once listens as if to a sound nobody else can hear . <P> Nobody else can . For Alfred Hitchcock directed Rebecca , and the 17-stone British melo-maestro knows that nothing is more mysterious in a film than extra sensory perceptions . He knows too that of all mysterious things the most mysterious can be the ordinary human face . <P> The picture is full of watchful faces . <P> Rebecca is Director Hitchcock 's second try at filming a Daphne du Maurier novel . <P> The first , Jamaica Inn , did not quite come off , due to friction between the bulgy Hitchcock and the bulky Charles Laughton egos . This time Hitchcock does it all his way , does a splendid job and has a splendid cast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taciturn , Byronic Maxim de Winter , the master of Manderley . Surprise of the picture is Joan Fontaine , who plays the second Mrs. de Winter with a shy , overeager , childlike charm suggestive of Selznick 's Swedish star , Ingrid Bergman . Judith Anderson is the housekeeper who worshiped the first Mrs. de Winter , hates the second . She stalks about as impassive and implacable as a Cornwall druidess . <P> Producer David O. Selznick has seen to it that Rebecca follows Daphne du Maurier 's novel as faithfully as Gone With the Wind followed Margaret Mitchell 's . So Director Hitchcock faced the usual problem of filming a wordy book - how to convey long-winded off-stage narrative background without slowing up the fast-moving camera . Out of this handicap Director Hitchcock makes his most exciting scenes . Touching are Joan Fontaine 's half-apologetic , half-reluctant reminiscences about her artist father . <P> Olivier 's eight-minute monologue in the abandoned boathouse , as he tells Joan Fontaine about his last night with Rebecca , is the picture 's real climax . <P> Hitchcock uses every directorial device to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expletive , now subdued , now casual ) of Olivier 's beautifully controlled voice , the dramatic pantomime of his gestures ( now hopeless , now resentful , now resigned ) . Every angle of the fatal room is probed as the camera follows Olivier while he walks about aimlessly or leans restlessly against a wall , a chair , a window . <P> As his voice describes Rebecca 's death , the actors disappear from the picture . <P> The camera reveals in the still life of the room-Rebecca 's ash tray still heaped with cigarette stubs , the over-plump cushions of her flowered couch-the real life of the woman which her husband is revealing for the first time to another person . As Olivier pauses , the cobwebbed telephone shrills like a police siren in the silence ; scene and story reach their star-shell denouement . <P> Joan Fontaine has played bit parts in half-a-dozen pictures . She raised critics ' eyebrows as Fred Astaire 's leading lady ( A Damsel in Distress ) , then made critics sit up with a small part in The Women .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
