Sadie Thompson ( adapted from John Colton 's and Clemence Randolph 's Rain by Howard Dietz and Rouben Mamoulian ; music &; lyrics by Vernon Duke and Mr. Dietz ; produced by A. P. Waxman ) is more frost than Rain . Behind the famous play of the missionary who brought a scarlet woman to God only to be himself ensnared by the Devil there was a steady theatrical drive . In Sadie Thompson that drive is halted by every song , every dance , every stage procession . <P> Sadie Thompson might have recouped many of its dramatic losses with a winning run of songs &; dances . But Composer Duke 's tunes are undistinguished and the dancing , although better , is uneven : a montage of scenes from Sadie 's life has real choreographic color , and last season 's Merry Widow team of Milada Mladova and Chris Volkoff have style and skill ; but there is too much regulation South Seas wriggling and a generally poor ballet . <P> The show 's biggest asset is June Havoc 's Sadie . In a role that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeanne Eagels , Tallulah Bankhead , Gloria Swanson , Joan Crawford and others , the frisky comedienne ( late of Mexican Hayride ) does not always measure up . But she lifts the part above its surroundings , is always engaging as June Havoc .
