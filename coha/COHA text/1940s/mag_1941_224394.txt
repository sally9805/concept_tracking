The President added a ninth point last week to the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration of peace aims-religious freedom . Said he , in transmitting his eight points to Congress : " It is also unnecessary for me to point out that the declaration of principles includes of necessity the world need for freedom of religion . " <P> By declaring this unnecessary , the President acknowledged its necessity , answered the criticism its omission had previously stirred up in religious circles . <P> &gt; Same day the ungodly Russians tried to cash in on Christianity . The Moscow radio , in its Slovak , Dutch , Rumanian and Bulgarian broadcasts , charged the Nazis with " menacing the very existence of Christianity , " called upon " all God-loving inhabitants of the occupied countries " to rise in defense of their religious freedom . <P> To prove the godliness of Russia , Moscow announced that there are 8,338 churches , mosques and synagogues for the 192,695,710 people in the land of the Soviet Union . Comparable ( but not cited ) figure for the U.S. : 244,319 for 131,669,275 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
