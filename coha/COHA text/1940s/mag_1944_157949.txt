For the time being the U.S. Army had its manpower problem under control . Last week it had a cushion of 150,000 beyond its planned strength ( 7,700,000 ) . <P> But this extra margin of manpower would bring no cobwebs to U.S. draft boards . Last week the Navy asked Selective Service for 194,000 more men by year 's end than it had originally asked ( new total : 3,200,000 ) . Reason for the Navy 's new draft : the speedup in the Pacific war .
