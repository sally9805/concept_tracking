txt The two-weeks-old " food saving " program is saving little food . But it 's raising a crop of confusion among those who sell and those who buy for the dinner table . These are the key findings of a week-end Wall Street Journal survey of restaurants and retail food distributors in 10 cities from coast to coast Said a member of the National Association , of Food Chains in Chicago : " We ca n't tell whether the housewife Is observing meatless Tuesday or not . We do n't know when she serves what she buys . But we do know she 's continuing to buy as much as she has been buying ever since meat prices got so high . " This statement reflects the general picture ? no noticeable , over-all drop in meat sales as a result of the " meatless " days . But some markets report actual cuts in their trade . Typical among these is one small Philadelphia market operator who says : " Last Tuesday I sold only about 25 pounds of meat . Normally I sell around 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost all retail market men name soaring prices as a bigger curb on meat buying than " meatless Tuesdays . " Typical comments : " Even before the ' conservation ' started many women were feeding their families spaghetti till it ran out their ears . " " All days will soon be meatless if prices keep climbing . " Some food retailers say Tuesday meat sales have dipped  --  but then quickly add that it 's balanced by bigger buying on Mondays and Wednesdays . Others say that as far as they can tell , housewives are n't paying any attention to the Tuesday " ban . " Said the manager of the butcher department in a big Los Angeles market : " Last Tuesday we had the biggest meat sales of any day in two weeks . On Thursday the first two sales were chickens . " Chicken Is Sunday Meal But Thursday chicken business is an unspirited activity any time , market operators declare . " ' Poultrylcss Thursday ' does n't mean a thing . " says one in Pittsburgh " Women do n't buy chicken on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This comment was repeated in city after city . ( Word from Washington yesterday indicated that poultryless Thursday might be dropped from the food conservation program . Story on Page 3 . The " conservation " program has spread its worst confusion in the ranks of the restaurant fraternity . " Cooperative " restaurants that do n't serve meat find huffy customers trotting off to other eateries that do . In the Pittsburgh area it is estimated that for every 50 restaurants " cooperating " there are another 50 operating " as usual " In San Francisco , almost all the hotels are trying bravely to keep step with the " program " But practically all restaurants are ignoring it . Problems in Portland A typical story of confusion comes from Portland , Oregon . There the independent meat markets decided to do a real job of " cooperation , " and 72% of them voluntarily closed shop on Tuesday . But the chain stores stayed open and snapped up the business . The Portland independents blamed Washington for not giving them support " We did get a telegram from Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't mean a damn thing . He said he was greatly heartened by our effort and thanked us " This Portlander and his fellow independents say they are wide open for business from here on out . Three out of every four Portland restaurants served no meat last Tuesday . But now 75% of last week 's " cooperators " say they are going to observe no more meatless days . Probably the most confused among the food men are those trying to figure out how eating fewer grain-consuming animals is going to help the government attain its announced objective of saving 100 million bushels of grain . Befuddlement in Los Angeles One befuddled Los Angeles meat buyer who has been in the business for 35 years has been thinking the " conservation " matter over for two weeks and always comes up with this conclusion : " There are going to be an awful lot of chickens around eating grain this winter if we do n't eat them first . And a dead cow wo n't eat as much as a live one . " Retailers everywhere report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying of some foods . This Is so far mainly centered in sugar and /Sour . Grocers try to tell the ladies that sugar is more than plentiful and that flour will be spoiled by weevils if kept in quantity for long . " But , " as one says , " it does n't do much good . They read the ' shortage ' headlines . And they 're getting the hoarding psychology . " Some grocers say women have started stocking pantries with canned goods . Others name other foods . Says a retailer in Detroit : " One woman I know has bought 100 pounds of beans where she usually buys one or two pounds a week . She 'll have to move out of her two-room apartment to make room for the beans . " Bread Reports Mixed On the question of whether bread conailmntion has fallen off since the " conservation " program got under way , reports vary : but concenaus is that if there has been an overall decline , It has not been sharp . One big East Coast baking chain says bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Sunday night broadcast launching the program of less eating . A big Detroit bakery says it has noticed no sales decline . A bakery in Los Angeles which sells only to restaurants estimates that its business is down only about 3% or 4% . One thing on which all food men are agreed Is that they want no return to food rationing . And leaders in the trade almost all agree that there is extremely scant likelihood that any attempt will be made at reinstating ra ' tioning . This opinion is shared among most officials in Washington . One tremendous obstacle to a return to rationing , food experts in and out of Washington agree , would be the job of setting up ' the vast mechanics of a rationing program . A top Washington official put it this way : " Even in 0 P.A. 's palmiest days . when it had thousands of employes , it was estimated that 90 days would be required to get a breadrationing program started . It would be unthinkable that anything like that could be attempted today , with no basic @ @ @ @ @
