IN this true story of the French Air Force in May 1940 , Captain Saint-Exupery describes the experiences of his own decimated escadrille ( six planes out of twenty-three survive ) , and more particularly what is happening to his plane , Dutertre his observer , his gunner , and himself on a dangerous sortie over Arras . Here in prose of epic quality is the story of man 's courage in the face of defeat . The chapters describing the take-off and the chaos within the French lines appeared in the Atlantic for January and February . ? Tnc Eniron XIX Right ! 179 ? . ' Call it one seventy-two . Epitaph : Maintained his course accurately on 172 ? . ' How long will this crazy challenge go on ? I am flying now at two thousand three hundred feet beneath a ceiling of heavy clouds . If I were to rise a mere hundred feet Dutertre would be blind . Thus we are forced to remain visible to the anti-aircraft batteries and play the part of an archer 's target for the Germans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves as a mark for the whole plain . You drain the cannonade of a whole army . You are within range of every calibre . You dwell an eternity in the field of fire of each successive weapon . You are not shot at with cannon but beaten with a stick . It is as if a thousand sticks were used to bring down a single walnut . I had given a bit of thought to this problem . There is no question of a parachute . When the stricken plane dives to the ground the opening of the escape hatch takes more seconds than the dive of the plane allows . Opening the hatch involves seven turns of a crank that sticks . Besides , at full speed the hatch warps and refuses to slide . That 's that . The medicine had to be swallowed some day . I always knew it . Meanwhile , the formula is not complicated : stick to 172 ? . One seventy-four . ' Right ! One seventy-four . ' Call it one seventy-four . Must change that epitaph .

One sixty-eight . ' Right ! 0110 sixty-eight . ' Call it one sixty-eight . Interesting , that the road to eternity should be zigzag . And so peaceful ! The earth here looks like an orchard . A moment ago it seemed to me skeletal , inhumanly desiccated . But I am flying low in a sort of intimacy with it . There are trees , some standing isolated , others in clusters . You meet them . And green fields . And houses with red tile roofs . One seventy-five .

Engine coughing ? Growing cold . I shut the ventilators of the hood . Good . Time to change over to the reserve tanks . I pull the lever . Have I forgotten anything ? I glance at the oil gauge . Everything shipshape . Beginning to get a bit nasty , Captain . ' Beginning to get nasty . And yet I can not help being astonished by the blue of the evening . It is so extraordinary . The color is so deep . And those fruit trees , plum trees , perhaps , flowing by . I am part of the countryside now . I am a marauder who has jumped over the wall . I am running through the wet alfalfa , stealing plums . This is an odd war . A war nostalgic and beautifully blue . I got lost somehow , and strayed into this strange country in my old age . . . . Zigzag , Captain ! ' Here is a new game . You kick the rudder bar with your right foot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch you . When , as a child , I fell down I used to bruise myself and raise swellings . I am sure my nurse used to cure me with compresses of arnica . I am going to need arnica awfully , I think . Forward of my plane I saw suddenly three lance-strokes aimed at my machine . Three long brilliant vertical twigs . The paths of tracer bullets fired from a small-calibre gun . They were golden . Suddenly in the blue of the evening I had seen the spurting glow of a three-branched candlestick . Captain ! Firing very fast to port . Hard down ! ' I kicked my rudder . Getting worse ! ' Worse ? Yes , it is getting worse ; but I feel none of those things I thought I should feel when facing the claws of these shooting stars . I am in a country that moves my heart . Day is dying . On the left I see great slabs of light among the showers . They are like panes in a cathedral window . Almost within reach , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are those plum trees with their plums . There is that earth-smelling earth . It must be wonderful to tramp over damp earth . Arras ! ' Yes . Very far ahead . But Arras is not a town . Arras thus far is no more than a red plume against a blue background of night . Against a background of storm . For unmistakably , forward on the left , an awful squall is collecting . Twilight alone would not explain this half-light . It wants blocks of clouds to filter a glow so sombre . The flame of Arras is bigger now . You would n't call it the flame of a conflagration . A conflagration spreads like a chancre surrounded by no more than a narrow edge of living flesh . That red plume permanently alight is the gleam of a lamp that might be smoking a bit . It is a flame without flicker , sure to last , well fed with oil . I can feel it moulded and kneaded out of a compact substance , something almost solid that the wind stirs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's it : a tree . Arras is caught up in the mesh of roots of this tree . And all the pith of Arras , all the substance of Arras , all the treasures of Arras leap , now become sap , to nourish this tree . I can see that occasionally top-heavy flame lose its equilibrium to right or left , belch forth an even blacker cloud of smoke , and then collect itself again . But I am still unable to make out the town . The whole war is summed up in that glow . Dutertre says that it is getting worse . Perched up forward , he can see better than I can . Nevertheless , I am astonished by a sort of indulgence shown us : this venomous plain sends forth few stars . Captain ! Captain ! I 've never seen anything like it ! ' Nor have I. Where now is my vulnerability ? Unknown to myself , I had been hoping . . . . xx Despite my lack of altitude , I had been hoping . Despite the tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been hoping . I had been using every trick in my bag . When Dutertre said to me , ' It 's getting worse , ' I used even that threat as a source of hope . We were at war : necessarily , then , there had to be evidence of war . The evidence was no more than a few streaks of light . ' Is this your terrible danger of death over Arras ? Do n't make me laugh ! ' I myself could not but be deceived ? since this whole world was snug and verdant , since the wet slate and tile shone so cordially , since from minute to minute nothing changed or promised to change . Since we three , Dutertre , the gunner , and I , were men walking across fields , sauntering idly home without so much as the need to raise our collars , so little was it raining . Since here at the heart of the German zone nothing stood forth that was really worth telling about ; whence it must follow that , farther on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since it seemed that the enemy had scattered and melted into the wide and rural plain , standing perhaps at the rate of one soldier to a house , one soldier to a tree , one of whom , remembering now and then the war , would fire . The order had been drummed into the fellow 's ears : Fire on all enemy planes . ' But he had been daydreaming , and the order had been dimmed by the dream . He let fly his three rounds without much expectation of results . Thus at dusk I used to shoot ducks that meant very little to me if the evening invited my soul . I would fire while talking about something else . It hardly disturbed the ducks . How vulnerable I was ! Yet it seemed to me that my very vulnerability was a trap , a means of cajoling the enemy : Why fire ? Your friends are sure to bring me down a little farther on . ' And they would shrug their shoulders : Go break your neck somewhere else . ' They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were anxious not to miss their turn at the soup , were finishing their funny story , or were simply enjoying the evening breeze . I was taking advantage of their negligence , and I was saved by the seeming coincidence that all of them at once appeared to be weary of war . And why not ? Already I was thinking vaguely that from soldier to soldier , squad to squad , village to village , I should get through this sortie . After all , what were we but a passing plane in the evening sky ? Not enough to make a man raise his eyes . Of course I hoped to get back . But I could feel at the same time that something was in the air . You are sentenced ; a penalty hangs over you ; but the gaol in which you are locked up continues silent . You cling to that silence . Every second that drops is like the one that went before . There is no reason why the second about to drop should change the world . Such a task is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows safe .. guards your silence . Already this silence seems perpetual . But the step of him who must come sounds in the corridor . Something in this countryside suddenly exploded . So a log that seemed burnt out crackles suddenly and shoots forth its sparks . How did it happen that the whole plain started up at the same moment ? When spring comes , all the trees at once drop their seed . Why this sudden springtime of arms ? Why this luminous flood rising towards us and , of a sudden , universal ? My first feeling was that I had been careless . I had ruined everything . A wink , a single gesture is enough to topple you from the tightrope . A mountain climber coughs , and he releases an ava- lanche . Once he has released the avalanche , all is over . We had been swaying heavily through this blue swamp already drowned in night . We had stirred up this silent slime ; and now , in tens of thousands , it was sending towards us its golden bubbles . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jugglers was dribbling its projectiles in tens of thousands in our direction . Because they came straight at us , they appeared at first to be motionless . Like colored balls which jugglers seem not so much to fling into the air as to release upwards , they rose in a lingering ascension . I could see those tears of light flowing towards me through a silence as of oil . That silence in which jugglers perform . Each burst of a machine gun or a rapid-fire cannon shot forth hundreds of these phosphorescent bullets that followed one another like the beads of a rosary . A thousand elastic rosaries strung themselves out towards the plane , drew themselves out to the breaking point , and burst at our height . When , missing us , the string went off at a tangent , its speed was dizzying . The bullets were transformed into lightning . And I flew drowned in a crop of trajectories as golden as stalks of wheat . I flew at the centre of a thicket of lance-strokes . I flew threatened by a vast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now bound to me , woven and wound round me , a coruscating web of golden wire . I leaned towards the earth and saw those storied levels of luminous bubbles rising with the tardy movement of veils of fog . I saw as I stared the slow vortex of seed , swirling like the husk of threshed grain . And when I raised my head I saw on the horizon those stacks of lances . Guns firing ? Not at all ! I am attacked by cold steel . These are swords of light . I feel . . . certainly not in danger ! Dazzled I am by the luxury that envelops me . What 's that ! I was jolted nearly a foot out of my seat . The plane has been rammed hard , I thought . It has burst , been ground to bits . . . . But it has n't ; it has n't . . . . I can still feel it responsive to the controls . This was but the first blow of a deluge of blows . Yet there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns had probably blended into the dark ground . I raised my head and stared . What I saw was without apfical . XXI I had been looking on at a carnival of light . The ceiling had risen little by little and I had been unaware of an intervening space between the clouds and me . I had been zigzagging along a line of flight dotted by ground batteries . Their tracer bullets had been spraying the air with wheat-colored shafts of light . I had forgotten that at the top of their flight the shells of those batteries must burst . And now , raising my head , I saw around and before me those rivets of smoke and steel driven into the sky in the pattern of towering pyramids . I was quite aware that those rivets were no sooner driven than all danger went out of them , that each of those puffs possessed the power of life and death only for a fraction of a second . But so sudden and simultaneous was their appearance that the image flashed into my mind of conspirators intent upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I felt on the nape of my neck the weight of an inescapable reprobation . Muffled as those explosions reached me , their sound covered by the roar of my engines , I had the illusion of an extraordinary silence . Those vast packets of smoke and steel , moving soundlessly upward and behind me with the lingering flow of icebergs , persuaded me that , seen in their perspective , I must be virtually motionless . I was motionless in the dock before an immense assizes . The judges were deliberating my fate , and there was nothing I could plead . Once again the timelessness of suspense seized me . I thought , ? I was still able to think , ? ' They are aiming too high , ' and I looked up in time to see straight overhead , swinging away from me as if with reluctance , a swarm of black flakes that glided like eagles . Those eagles had given me up . I was not to be their prey . But even so , what hope was there for me ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their aim . New walls of smoke and steel continued to be built up round me as I flew . The ground-fire was not seeking me out , it was closing me in . Dutertrel How much more of this is there ? ' Stick it out three minutes , Captain . Looks bad , though . ' Think we 'll get through ? ' Not on your life ! ' There never was such muck as this murky smoke , this mess as grimy as a heap of filthy rags . The plain was blue . Immensely blue . Deep-sea blue . What was a man 's life worth between this blue plain and this foul sky ? Ten seconds , perhaps ; or twenty . The shock of the exploding shells set all the sky shuddering . When a shell burst very near , the explosion rumbled along the plane like rock dropping through a chute . And when for a moment the roar stopped , the plane rang with a sound that was almost musical . Like a sigh , almost ; and the sigh told us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thunder : the closer they came , the simpler they were . A rumble meant distance , a clean bang ! meant that we had been squarely hit by a shell fragment . The tiger does not do a messy job on the ox it brings down . The tiger sets its claws into the ox without skidding . It takes possession of the ox . Each square hit by a fragment of shell sank into the hull of the plane like a claw into living flesh . Anybody hurt ? ' Not I ! ' Gunner ! You all right ? ' O.K. , sir ! ' Somehow those explosions , though I find I must mention them , did not really count . They drummed upon the hull of the plane as upon a drum . They pierced my fuel tanks . They might as easily have drummed upon our bellies , pierced them instead . What is the belly but a kind of drum ? But who cares what happens to his body ? Extraordinary , how little the body matters . I used to wonder as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last moments were like . And each time , life would give the lie to the ghosts I evoked . Here I was , now , naked and running the gauntlet , unable so much as to guard my head by arm or shoulder from the crazy blows raining down upon me . I had always assumed that the ordeal , when it came , would be an ordeal that concerned my flesh . My flesh alone , I assumed , would be subjected to the ordeal . It was unavoidable that in thinking of these things I should adopt the point of view of my body . Like all men , I had given it a good deal of time . I had dressed it , bathed it , fed it , quenched its thirst . had identified myself with this domesticated animal . I had taken it to the tailor , the surgeon , the barber . I had been unhappy with it , cried out in pain with it , loved with it . I had said of it , ' This is me . ' And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body to me ? A kind of flunky in my service . Let but my anger wax hot , my love grow exalted , my hatred collect in me , and that boasted solidarity between me and my body was gone . Your son is in a burning house . Nobody can hold you back . You may burn up ; but do you think of that ? You are ready to bequeath the rags of your body to any man who will take them . You discover that what you set so much store by is trash . You would sell your hand , if need be , to give a hand to a friend . It is in your act that you exist , not in your body . Your act is yourself , and there is no other you . Your body belongs to you : it is not you . Are you about to strike an enemy ? No threat of bodily harm can hold you back . You ? It is the death of your enemy that is you . You ? It is the rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you exchange yourself against something else ; and you have no feeling that you lost by the exchange . Your members ? Tools . A tool snaps in your hand : how important is that tool ? You exchange yourself against the death of your enemy , the rescue of your child , the recovery of your patient , the perfection of your theorem . Here is a pilot of my Group wounded and dying . A true citation in general orders would read : Called out to his observer , " They 've got me ! Beat it ! And for God 's sake do n't lose those notes ! " ' What matters is the notes , the child , the patient , the theorem . Your true significance becomes dazzlingly evident . Your true name is duty , hatred , love , child , theorem . There is no other you than this . The flames of the house , of the diving plane , strip away the flesh ; but they strip away the worship of the flesh too . Man ceases to be concerned with himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . If he should die , he would not be cutting himself off from his kind , but making himself one with them . He would not be losing himself , but finding himself . This that I affirm is not the wishful thinking of a moralist . It is an everyday fact . It is a commonplace truth . But a fact and a truth hidden under the veneer of our everyday illusion . Dressing and fretting over the fate that might befall my body , it was impossible for me to see that I was fretting over something absurd . But in the instant when you are giving up your body , you learn to your amazement ? all men always learn to their amazement ? how little store you set by your body . It would be foolish to deny that duringall those years of my life when nothing insistent was prompting me , when the meaning of my existence was not at stake , it was impossible for me 10 conceive that anything might be half so important as my body . But here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' One way and another , I have dragged you through life to this point ; and here I discover that you are of no importance . ' Man does not die . Man imagines that it is death he fears ; but what he fears is the unforeseen , the explosion . What man fears is himself , not death . There is no death when you meet death . When the body sinks into death , the essence of man is revealed . Man is a knot , a web , a mesh into which relationships are tied . Only those relationships matter . The body is an old crock that nobody will miss . I have never known a man to think of himself when dying . Never . Captain ! ' What 's up ? ' Getting hot ! ' Gunner ! ' Er ... yes , sir . ' What ? ' My question vanished in the shock of another explosion . Dutertre ! ' Captain ? ' Hurt ? ' ' No . ' You , gunner ! ' Yes , sir . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze wall . A voice in my ear said , Boy ! oh , boy ! ' as I looked up to measure the distance to the overhanging clouds . The sharper the angle at which I stared , the more densely the murky tufts seemed to be piled up . Seen straight overhead , the sky was visible between them , they hung curved and scattered , forming a gigantic coronet in the air . A man 's thigh muscles are incredibly powerful . I bore down upon the rudder bar with all my strength and sent the plane shuddering and skidding at right angles to our line of flight . The coronet swung overhead and slid down on my right . I had got away from one of the batteries and left it firing wasted packets of shell . But before I could bring my other thigh into play the ground battery had set straight what hung askew ? the coronet of smoke was back again . Once more I bore down , and again the plane groaned and swayed in this swampy sky . All the weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had swung , had skidded squarely to starboard . The coronet curved now above me on the left . Would we last it out ? But how could we ! Each time that I brought the ship brutally round , the deluge of lance-strokes followed me before I could jerk back again . Each time the coronet was set back into place and the shell bursts shook up the plane anew . And each time , when I looked down , I saw again that same dizzyingly slow ascension of golden bubbles that seemed to be accurately centred upon my plane . How did it happen that we were still whole ? I began to believe in us . ' I am invulnerable , after all , ' I said to myself . ' I am winning . From second to second , I am more and more the winner . ' ' Anybody hurt yet ? ' ' Nobody . ' They were unhurt . They were invulnerable . They were victorious . I was the owner of a winning team . And from that moment each explosion seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each time , for a fraction of a second , it seemed to me that my plane had been blown to bits ; but each time it responded anew to the controls and nursed it along like a coachman pulling hard on the reins . I began to relax , and a wave of jubilation went through me . There was just time enough for me to feel fear as no more than a physical stiffening induced by a loud crash , when instantly after each buffet a wave of relief went through me . I ought to have felt successively theshock , then the fear , then the relief ; but there was n't time . What I felt was the shock , then instantly the relief . Shock , relief . Fear , the intermediate step , was missing . And during the second that followed the shock I did not live in the expectancy of death in the second to come , but in the conviction of resurrection born of the second just passed . I lived in a sort of slipstream of joy , in the wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through me . It was as if , with each second that passed , life was being granted me anew . As if with each second that passed my life became a thing more vivid to me . I was living . I was alive . I was still alive . I was the source of life itself . I was thrilled through with the intoxication of living . ' The heat of battle ' is a familiar phrase ; the heat of living is a truer one . ' I wonder , ' I said to myself , ' if those Germans below who are firing at us know that they are creating life within us ? ' All my tanks had been pierced , both gas and oil . Otherwise we seemed to be sound . Dutertre called out that he was through , and once again I looked up and calculated the distance to the clouds . I raised the nose of the ship , and once again I sent the plane zigzagging as I climbed . Once again I cast a glance earthwards . What I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with short wicks of spurting flame ? the rapid-fire cannon . The colored balls were still floating upward through an immense blue aquarium of air . Arras was glowing dark red like iron on the anvil , a flame fed by subterranean stores , by the sweat of men , the inventions of men , the arts of men , the memories and patrimony of men , all these braided in the ruddy ascension of that single plume that changed them into fire and ash , borne away on the wind . Already I was flying through the first packets of mist . Golden arrows still rose and pierced the belly of the cloud , and just as the cloud closed round me I caught through an opening my last glimpse of that scene . For a single instant the flame over Arras rose up glowing in the night like a lamp in the nave of a cathedral . The lamp that was Arras was burning in the service of a cult , but at a price . By tomorrow it would have consumed Arras and itself have been consumed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain . Two-forty , please . We sha n't be able to come down out of this cloud for about twenty minutes . Then I 'll pick up a landmark along the Seine somewhere . ' Everything all right , gunner ? ' Everything fine , sir . ' Not too hot for you , was it ? ' No , I guess not , sir . ' Hard for him to tell . But he was feeling fine . I thought of Gavoille 's gunner . In the days when this was still a very odd war , we used to do long-distance reconnaissance over Germany . There was a night over the Rhine when eighty searchlights picked up Gavoille 's plane and built a giant basilica round it . The anti-aircraft began to fire , and suddenly Gavoille heard his gunner talking to himself ? for the intercom is hardly a private line . The man was muttering a dialogue of one : ' Think you 've been around , do you ? I 'll tell you something you 've never seen ! ' He was feeling fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaths . I filled my lungs to the bottom . It was wonderful to breathe again . There were many things I was going to find out about . First I thought of Alias . No , that 's not true . I thought first of my host , my farmer . I still looked forward to asking him how many instruments he thought a pilot had to watch . Sorry , but I am stubborn about some things . One hundred and three . He would never guess . Which reminds me . When your tanks have been pierced , it does no harm to have a look at your gauges . Wonderful tanks ! Their rubber coatings haddone their job ; automatically , they had contracted and plugged the holes made by bullets and shell splinters . I had a look at my stabilizers too . This cloud we flew in was a storm cloud . It shook us up pretty badly . Think we can come down now ? ' Ten minutes more . Better wait another ten minutes . ' Of course I could wait another ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alias . Was he still expecting us , I wondered ? The other day we had been half an hour late . A half hour is generally longer than you ought to be : it means trouble . I had landed and run to join the Group , who were at table . I had opened the door and fallen into a chair beside Alias . At that moment he had a cluster of spaghetti on his fork and was preparing to tuck it away . He jumped , took a good look at me , and sat perfectly still , the noodles hanging from his fork . Well , I . . . Glad to see you , ' he said . And he stuffed the noodles into his mouth . The major has one serious fault , to my mind . He insists stubbornly on examining his pilots about their sorties . He will examine me . He will sit looking at me with embarrassing patience , waiting for me to spin out my commonplace observations . He will have armed himself with paper and pencil , determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall presumably have brought back . Intelligence is Dutertre 's business , not mine . He is the observer ; I am the pilot . From where he sits he can see straight below . He sees lots of things ? lorries , barges , tanks , soldiers , cannon , horses , railway stations , trains , station masters . From where I sit I see the world at an angle . I see clouds , sea , rivers , mountains , sun . I see roughly , and get only a general impression . Major , you know as well as I do that a pilot .. Come , come , Saint-Ex ! You do see some things , after all . ' I . . . Oh , yes ! Flames . Villages burning . Does n't the major think that interesting ? Nonsense ! The whole country is on fire . What else ? ' Why must Alias be so cruel ? XX II What I bring back from this sortie is not matter for a report . When Alias examines me I shall flunk like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall seem very unhappy , and yet I shall not be unhappy . Unhappiness is behind me . It fled in that instant when the shell bursts began to drum upon the plane . Had I turned back one second before , I should have missed knowing myself . I should never have known the flood of affection that at this moment fills my heart . I am going back to my own kind . I am going home . I am like a housewife whose shopping is done and who is on her way home , her mind on the savory dinner with which she is about to delight her family . Her market basket swings on her arm to left and right . Even in the belly of this cloud I am on my way home from market . The major was right , after all . When he sent us off in a voice that seemed to say , And then you take the first turn to the right , where you will see a tobacco shop , ' his voice was pitched on the right note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major 's matches in my pocket ? or more truly , Dutertre has them in his pocket . How Dutertre manages to remember what he saw , I can not imagine . But that is his business . My mind is on more serious things . We shall land ; and if the enemy spare us the nuisance of a sudden rush to still another field , I shall challenge Lacordaire and beat him at chess . He hates to lose . So do I. But I shall win . Yesterday , be it said without dishonor , Lacordaire got tight . At least , a little tight . He had got tight in order to console himself . Coming in from a sortie , he had forgotten to release his landing gear and had set the plane down on her belly . Unfortunately , Alias had seen him do it ; but he had not said a word . And Lacordaire , a pilot of long experience , had stood by , waiting for Alias to turn upon him . He had stood by hoping that Alias would curse him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have allowed him to explode too . It would have allowed him to get off his chest the rage against himself that was swelling in him . But Alias had merely shaken his head sadly . Alias 's mind was on the plane , not on the pilot . To the major , this accident was a kind of anonymous misfortune , a statistical tax levied on the Group . It was the effect of one of those moments of absent-mindedness that attack even the most experienced pilots . It was an injustice , and Lacordaire was its victim . Except this blunder , Lacordaire 's professional record was clean . Alias knew this , and all that bothered him was the plane . Automatically , without thinking , he turned to Lacordaire and asked him how bad he thought the damage was . And I could feel Lacordaire 's pent-up rage rise a degree at the question . You put your hand cordially on the torturer 's shoulder and say to him , ' How badly do you think your victim is suffering ? ' Truly , the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sympathy exasperates the torturer . He flings a black look at the victim and is sorry he has n't finished her off . I am on my way home . Group 2-33 is my home . And I understand my kind . I can not be mistaken about Lacordairc . Lacordaire can not be mistaken about me . Nothing is stronger than the community of feeling between us , the feeling that goes through me when I say , We of Group 2-332 The particles , the fragments that we are , collect and possess meaning in the fact of the Group . Flying in the cloud , I think of Gavoille linesdeleted swing round the sky except a slightly better right to sit down at their table and be silent with them ? The right is dearly bought ; but it is a dear right . It is the right to be , and thus to escape non-being . Yet the notion that I shall stammer when , some minutes from now , Alias will put his questions , makes me go red . I shall feel ashamed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiotic . The shame that I feel already by anticipation is genuine . Yet . . . Once again I had taken off ? this time to Arras ? in search of the proof of my good faith . I had risked my flesh in this sortie . I had risked it being pretty sure that I should lose it . I had given everything to the rules of the game in order to turn them somehow into something other than the rules of the game . And this being so , I have won the right to appear sheepish when the major examines me . The right , that is , to participate . To be interwoven with the rest . To commune with them . To give and receive . To be more than myself . To possess this plenitude that swells so powerfully within me . To feel the love that I feel for the Group , a love that is not an impulse from without but is something inward and never to be manifested ? except at a farewell dinner . At a farewell dinner you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born of alcohol is sure to make you lean towards your friends as a tree whose boughs bend with gifts . My love of the Group has no need of definition . It is woven of bonds . It is my substance . I am of the Group , and the Group is of me . And as I think of the Group , it is impossible for me not to think of Hochede . Hochede made a total gift of himself to this war . More , probably , than any of us , Hochede dwells permanently in that state which I have striven so hard to attain to . Hochede has arrived at the goal towards which the rest of us tend , the goal I seek to reach . Hochede is a former sergeant recently promoted second lieutenant . I can imagine that his culture is slight . He is unable to shed any light upon himself . But he is constructed , he is complete . The word ' duty ' loses all bombast when applied to Hochede . Any man would be happy to accept his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I reproach myself all my petty renunciations , my negligences , my laziness , and my moments of intellectualism , which is to say skepticism . This is not is sign in me of virtue but of intelligent jealousy . I should like to exist as completely as Hochede does . A tree solidly planted on its roots is a beautiful thing . The permanence of Hochede is a beautiful thing . Hochede could never disappoint . Volunteer ? We were all volunteers on all our sorties . For the rest of us , the reason was a vague need to believe in ourselves . By volunteering , we outdid ourselves a little . Hochede was a volunteer by nature . He was , in essence , this war . The fact was so evident that when a plane was bound to be sacrificed the major thought automatically of Hochede . Look here , Hochede . . . Hochede was steeped in this war as a monk is steeped in religion . For whom did he fight ? For himself , since he was interwoven with the war , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a certain substance , and that substance , which was his own significance , had to be saved . At Hochede 's level , life and death are somewhat the same thing . Hochede was already part of both . Perhaps without realizing it , he hardly feared death . Stick it out ; make others stick it out ? that was what mattered . For Hochede , life and death had become reconciled . I am part of Israel , of Gavoille , of Hochede , and they are part of me . I am part of Group 2-33 , and it of me . I am part of my country , and it of me . My country and I are one . And all the men of Group 2-33 are one with their country . XXIII I have changed a good deal . I had been bitter these last days , Major Alias ? these last days when the armored invasion was meeting no resistance , when our sacrificial offerings cost the Group seventeen out of twenty-three crews . It had seemed to inc that we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of dead men merely because the show called for dead supernumeraries . I had been bitter , Major Alias ; and I had been wrong . You in particular , but the rest of us too , had clung to the letter of a duty whose spirit had ceased to be visible for us . You had driven us intuitively not towards victory , which was impossible , but towards self-fulfillment . You knew as well as we did that the intelligence we brought back would never reach the Staff . But you were salvaging rites whose power none of us could perceive . Each time that you examined us on the lorries , the barges , the railway trains we had spotted , examined us as soberly as if our answers could possibly serve a purpose , you seemed to me revoltingly hypocritical . But you were right , Major Alias . Until I learned what I learned over Arras , I could feel no responsibility for this stream of refugees over which once more I fly . I can be bound to no men except those to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I am bound . I exist only to the degree that I am nourished by the springs at my roots . I am bound to that mob on the highways , and it is bound to me . At three hundred miles an hour and an elevation of six hundred feet , now that I have come down out of the clouds , I have become one with that mob . I , flying in the descending night , am like a shepherd who in a single glance counts and collects and welds his scattered sheep into a flock again . That mob is no longer a mob , it is a people . We dwell in the rot of defeat , yet I am filled with a solemn and abiding jubilation , as if I had just come from a sacrament . I am steeped in chaos , yet I have won a victory . Is there a single pilot of the Group who ever flew home without this feeling of victory in his breast ? This very day , when Penicot came in from a morning 's low-altitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he spoke : ' Whenever one of their ground batteries seemed to me to be aiming too well for my comfort , I would zoom down just above the ground and make straight for the battery at full speed , and the spray from my guns would blow out their ruddy fire as if it was a candle . Before they knew it , I was on their gun crew , and you would have thought I was a bursting shell . Bang ! The crew would scatter and flop in every direction . I swear , I felt as if I was scattering ninepins . ' And Pimicot , victorious captain , roared with glee , as pleased with himself as Gavoille 's gunner when they flew through the vault of the enemy searchlights like a military wedding-party marching under an arch of swords . Ninety-four , Captain . ' Dutertre had picked up a landmark along the Seine , and we were down now to four hundred feet . Flowing beneath me at three hundred miles an hour , the earth was drawing great rectangles of wheat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windscreen . Divided by the stem of the plane , the flow of the broken landscape to left and right filled me with a curious satisfaction . The Seine shone below , and when I crossed its winding course at an angle it seemed to speed past and pivot upon itself . The swirl of the river was as lovely in my sight as the curve of a sickle in a field . I felt restored to my element . I was captain of my ship . The fuel tanks were holding out . I should certainly win a drink at poker dice from P ? nicot and then beat Lacordaire at chess . It was impossible for me not to con- trast in my mind the two worlds of plane and earth . I had led Dutertre and my gunner this day beyond the bourne at which reasonable men would stop . We had seen France in flames . We had seen the sun shining on the sea . We had grown old in the upper altitudes . We had bent our glance upon a distant earth as over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight with the dust of enemy fighter planes . Thereafter we had dropped earthward a'gain and flung ourselves into the holocaust . What we could offer up , we had sacrificed . And in that sacrifice we had learned even more about ourselves than we should have done after ten years in a monastery . We had come forth again after ten years in a monastery . And in the little time we ha . d taken to wander so far , the caravan of refugees over which we flew had perhaps advanced five hundred yards . In less time than it would take them to lift a motorcar out of a ditch and set it back on the road again , in less time than many a driver would sit drumming impatiently on the wheel as he waited for a stream of traffic to empty itself out of a crossroad , we should be safely back in our haven . At a single bound we had leaped over the whole defeat . We were above and beyond it , pilgrims stronger than the desert through which they toil because already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is their destination . This night now falling would park that unhappy people of refugees in its stable of misery . The flock would huddle together for comfort , but to whom , to what would it cry out ? Whereas we fly towards comrades and a kind of celebration . A lamplight gleaming from the humblest but can change the rudest winter night into Christmas Eve . We in this plane are bound for a place where there will be comrades to welcome us . We in this plane are bound for the communion of our daily bread . Sufficient unto this day is the weariness and the bliss thereof . I shall turnover to the ground crew my ship made noble by her scars . I shall strip off my cumbrous flying clothes ; and as it is now too late to win that drink from Penicot , I shall go directly to table and dine among my comrades . We are late . Those who are late never return . Late , are they ? If late , then too late . Then nothing can be done for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet at the dinner hour , when the Group takes a census of its dead , one thing is done for them : they are made handsomer than was their wont . They are sketched forever in their most luminous smile . But we in this plane are surrendering that privilege . We shall surge up out of nowhere , like demons , like poachers in a wood . The major 's hand will stop with his bread half way to his mouth . He will stare at us . Perhaps he will say , ' Oh ! . . . Oh , there you are ! ' The rest will say nothing . They will scarcely throw us a glance . Men do not really grow old . Men are as pure when you come back to them as when you left them . ' Oh , there you are , you who are of our kind ! ' The words thought and not spoken , out of delicacy of feeling . We come home from our sortie ready for our silent reward . Its quality is unique , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize it as love . Love , when ordinarily we think of it , implies a more tumultuous pathos . But this is the veritable love ? a web woven of strands in which we are fulfilled . XXIV When I got back to my billet I found my farmer at table with his wife and niece . Tell me , ' I said to him ; ' how many instruments do you think a pilot has to look after ? ' How should I know ? Not my trade , ' he answered . ' Must be some missing , though , to my way of thinking . The ones you win a war with . Have some supper ? ' I said I 'd had supper at the mess , but already he was n't listening to me . You , our niece , there . Shove along a little . Make room for the captain . ' I was made to sit down between the girl and her aunt . Here was something besides the Group that I formed part of . Through my comrades I was woven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed : it has only to sprout , and its roots spread far and wide . Silently my farmer broke the bread and handed it round . Unruffled , austere , the cares of his day had clothed him in dignity . Perhaps for the last time at this table , he shared his bread with us as in an act of worship . I sat thinking of the wide fields out of which that substance had come . Tomorrow those fields would be invaded by the enemy . Oh , there would be no tumult of men and clashing arms ! The earth is vast . My farmer would see no more of the invasion than a solitary sentinel posted against the wide sky on the edge of the fields . In appearance nothing would have changed ; but a single sign is enough to tell man that everything has changed . The wind running through the field of grain will still resemble a wind running over the sea . But the wind in the grain is a more wonderful sweep , for as it ruffles the tips of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes stock of a future . The wind in the grain is the caress to the spouse , it is the hand of peace stroking her hair . Tomorrow that wheat will have changed . Wheat is something more than carnal fodder . To nourish man is not the same as to fatten cattle . Bread has more than one meaning . We have learned to see in bread a means of communion between men , for men break bread together . We have learned to see in bread the symbol of the dignity of labor , for bread is earned in the sweat of the brow . We have learned to see in bread the essential vessel of compassion , for it is bread that is distributed to the miserable . There is no savor like that of breadshared between men . And I saw of a sudden that the energy contained in this spiritual food , this bread of the spirit generated by that field of wheat , was in peril . Tomorrow , perhaps , when he broke bread again and sent it round the table , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow , perhaps , his bread would not bring the same glow into these faces round the table . For bread is like the oil of the lamp : its merit is in the light it sheds . I looked at the beautiful niece beside me and said to myself , ' Bread , in this child , is transmuted into languid grace . It is transmuted into modesty . It is transmuted into gentle silence . And tomorrow , perhaps , this same bread , by virtue of a single gray uniform rising on the edge of that ocean of wheat , though it nourish this same lamp , will perhaps no longer send forth this same glowing light . The power that is in this bread will have gone out of it . ' I had made war this day to preserve the glowing light in that lamp , and not to feed that body . I had made war for the particular radiation into which bread is transmuted in the homes of my countrymen . What moved me so deeply in that pensive little girl was the insubstantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed by the features of her face . It was the poem on the page , more than the page itself . The little girl felt that I was looking at her . She raised her eyes to mine . It seemed to me that she smiled at me . Her smile was hardly more than a breath over the face of the waters ; but that fugitive gleam was enough . I was moved . I felt , mysteriously present , a soul that belonged in this place and no other . There was a peace here , sensing which I murmured to myself , The peace of the kingdom of silence . ' That smile was the glow of the shining wheat . The face of the niece was unruffled again , veiling its unfathomable depth . The farmer 's wife sighed , looked round at us , and spoke no word . The farmer , his mind on the day to come , sat wrapped in his earthy wisdom . Behind the silence of these three beings there was an inner abundance that was like the patrimony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , threatened . Strange , the intensity with which I felt myself responsible for that invisible patrimony . I went out of the house to walk alone on the highway , and I carried with me a burden that seemed to me tender and in no wise heavy , like a child asleep in my arms . I walked slowly , not caring where I went . I had promised myself this conversation with my village ; but now I found that I had nothing to say . I strolled and lingered , filled with the thought of the ties that bound me to my people . I was one with them , they were one with me . That farmer handing round the bread had made no gift to us at table : he had shared with us and exchanged with us that bread in which all of us had our part . And by that sharing the farmer had not been impoverished but , enriched . He had eaten better bread , bread of the community , by that sharing . I strolled and lingered on the highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeless ; yet even in this I was not cut off from the rest . I was their part in hope . True , we were already beaten . True , all was in suspense . True , all was threatened . Yet despite this , I could not but feel in myself the serenity of victory . Contradiction in terms ? I do n't give a fig for terms . was like Penicot , Hochede , Alias , Gavoille . Like them , I had no language by which to justify my feeling of victory . But like them I was filled with the sense of my responsibility . And what man can feel himself at one and the same time responsible and hopeless ? Defeat . . . . Victory . . . . Terms I do not know what to make of . One victory exalts , another corrupts . One defeat kills , another brings life . Tell me what seed is lodged in your victory or your defeat , and I will tell you its future . Life is not definable by situations but by mutations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , and that is the victory that is lodged in the energy of the seed . Sow the seed in the wide black earth and already the seed is victorious , though time must contribute to the triumph of the wheat . This morning France was a shattered army and a chaotic population . But if in a chaotic population there is a single consciousness animated by a sense of responsibility , the chaos vanishes . A rock pile ceases to be a rock pile the moment a single man contemplates it , bearing within him the image of a cathedral . I shall not fret about the loam if somewhere in it a seed lies buried . The seed will drain the loam , and the wheat will blaze . He who accedes to contemplation transmutes himself into seed . He who makes a discovery pulls me by the sleeve to draw my attention to it . He who invents preaches his invention . How a Hochede will express himself or act , I do not know , nor does it matter . He will surely spread his tranquil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prime agent of victory . He who bears in his heart a cathedral to be built is already victorious . He who seeks to become sexton of a finished cathedral is already defeated . Victory is the fruit of love . Only love can say what face shall emerge from the clay . Only love can guide man towards that face . Intelligence is valid only as it serves love . Concerning the part played by intelligence , we were long in error . We neglected the substance of man . We believed that the virtuosity of base natures could aid in the triumph of noble causes , that shrewd selfishness could exalt spirits to sacrifice , that withered hearts could by a wind of phrases found brotherhood or love . We neglected Being . From the armored divisions that defeated us I learned a lesson which is to be read in their manual of tactics : ' An armored division should move against the enemy like water . It should bear lightly against the enemy 's wall of defense and advance only at the point where it meets with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth 's immensity . A continuous wall of men in France would have required a hundred million soldiers . There were always gaps between the units , and through those gaps the tanks made their way . The seed haunted by the sun never fails to find its way between the stones in the ground . And the pure logician , if no sun draws him forth , remains entangled in his logic . What direction should the armored column take to invest the rear of the enemy ? I do not know . What should the armored column be for this purpose ? It should be weight of sea pressing against dike . What ought we do ? This . That . The contrary of this or that . There is no determinism that governs the future . What ought we be ? That is the essential question , the question that concerns spirit and not intelligence . For spirit impregnates intelligence with the creation that is to come forth . And later , intelligence is brought to bed of creation . How should man go about building the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship will be born of a thousand errors and fumblings . But what should man be to build that first ship ? Here I seize the problem of creation at the root . Merchant . Soldier . In love with the prospect of faraway lands . For then of necessity designers and builders will be born of that love . They will drain the energy of workmen and one day launch a ship . What should we do to annihilate a forest ? The question is not easy . What be ? Obviously , a forest fire . Tomorrow we of France will enter into the night of defeat . May my country still exist when day dawns again . What ought we do to save my country ? I do not know . Contradictory things . Our spiritual heritage must be preserved , else our people will be deprived of theirgenius . Our people must be preserved , else our heritage will become lost . For want of a way to reconcile heritage and people in their formuke , logicians will be tempted to sacrifice either the body or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want my country to exist both in the flesh and in the spirit when day dawns . Therefore I must bear with all the weight of my love in that direction . There is no passage the sea can not clear for itself if it bear with all its weight . We are warmed by the awareness of the ties that bind us to our people ? wherefore we feel ourselves already victorious . We know that we are one with the rest . But that the rest may know it , we must learn to express it . That is a matter of consciousness and language . A matter also of avoiding the verbal traps of superficial logic and polemical wrangling in which substance is destroyed . Above all , we must not reject any part of that to which we belong . And therefore I , leaning back against a wall in the silence of the village night , home from my flight to Arras , enlightened , as it seemed to me , by my flight to Arras , imposed upon myself these rules that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of France , I shall never reject my people , whatever they may do . I shall never preach against them in the hearing of others . Whenever it is possible to take their defense , I shall defend them . If they cover me with shame , I shall lock up that shame in my heart and be silent . Whatever at such a time I shall think of them , I shall never bear witness against them . Does a husband go from house to house crying out to his neighbors that his wife is a strumpet ? Is it thus that he can preserve his honor ? No , for his wife is one with his home . No , for he can not establish his dignity against her . Let him go home to her , and there unburden himself of his anger . Thus , I shall not divorce myself from a defeat which surely will often humiliate me . I am part of France , and France is part of me . France brought forth men called Pascal , Renoir , Pasteur , Guillaumet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inept , were politicasters , were cheats . But it would be too easy for a man to declare himself part of the first France and not of the other . Defeat divides men . Defeat unbinds that which was bound . In this unbinding there is danger of death . I shall not contribute to these divisions between Frenchmen by casting the responsibility for the disaster upon those of my people who think differently from me . Where there is no judge , nothing is to be gained by hurling accusations . All Frenchmen were defeated together . I was defeated . Hochede was defeated . Hochede does not blame others for the defeat . Hochede says to himself , ' I , Hochede , who am one with France , was weak . France that is one with me , Hochede , was weak . I was weak in her , and she in me . ' Hochede knows perfectly that once he begins distinguishing between his people and himself , he glorifies only himself . And from that moment there ceases to exist a Hochede who is part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation : there remains a Hochede who is part of a desert . If I take upon myself a share in my family 's humiliation I shall be able to influence my family . It is part of me , as I am of it . But if I reject its humiliation , my family must collapse ; and I shall wander alone , filled with vainglory , but a shell as empty as a corpse . I reject non-being . My purpose is to be . And if I am to be , I must begin by assuming responsibility . Only a few hours ago I was blind . I was bitter . But now I am able to judge more clearly . Just as I refuse to complain of other Frenchmen , since now I feel myself one with France , so I am no longer able to conceive that France has the right to complain of the rest of the world . Eachis responsible for all . France was responsible for all the world . Had France been France , she might have stood to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rallied . She might have served as the keystone in the world 's arch . Had France possessed the flavor of France , the radiation of France , the whole world would have been magnetized into a resistance of which the spearhead would have been France . I reject henceforth my reproaches against the world . Assuming that at a given moment the world lacked a soul , France owed it to herself to serve as the world 's soul . The spiritual communion of men the world over did not operate in our favor . But had we stood for that communion of men , we should have saved the world and ourselves . In that task we failed . Each is responsible for all . Each is by himself responsible . Each by himself is responsible for all . I understand now for the first time the mystery of the religion whence was born the civilization I claim as my own : To bear the sins of man . ' Each man bears the sins of all men . This being so , I shall carry out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall consider that I am responsible not only for my own weakness but for the fanaticism of my enemy . To confess this guilt is to be neither soft nor tame-spirited . It is to abide by a principle of action . Had we considered ourselves responsible for the freezing up of our aerial cannon , our aerial cannon would not have frozen up . But when we proclaimed ourselves innocent of the faults of others , we lost the power to influence those others and to persuade them to produce flawless cannon . If I excuse myself on pretext of fatality , I subject myself to fatality . For my part , I refuse this subjection . Fatality does not exist . I am endowed with the power to influence that whole of which I form part . I am a constituent part of the community of mankind . xXV A religion that complained of the existence of infidels would seem to us preposterous . Where are religions recruited except among the heathen ? A civilization is like a religion : it is a seed , and its function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian values out of which it was born were placed in jeopardy by my failure . There was a time when those values radiated energy . Why is it that they are unable to make their way in my enemy ? It is distasteful to me to cast all the blame for this upon my enemy . It is distasteful to me to play the part of the lamb in order to denounce the wolf . The wolf is action . The lamb is inertia . To play the lamb may soothe my conscience , but it makes me out a victim . The role of victim is distasteful to me . There was a time when my civilization was action . It transformed mankind , freed slaves , cast down the cruel , reigned over empires . And am I to snivel and whine , call myself a poor bullied lamb ? I do not feel that I was born to play this miserable part . If I am feeble , the reason is that somewhere I was false to the rules that once made me strong . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before taking thought of my civilization . As soon as danger threatened , I took shelter behind my civilization . ' What ! ' I cried . ' Are you not ashamed to attack such a beautiful cathedral ? ' But I had long ceased to be the builder of that cathedral . I had been living in it as sexton , as beadle . Which is to say , as a man defeated . I had been taking advantage of its tranquillity , its tolerance , its warmth . I had been a parasite . It had meant to me no more than a place where I was snug and secure . My civilization had given me the right to believe in the community of men . Trapped , I had cried out to that community for help . My enemies , I cried , are betraying our community . But my friends pleaded other business . Thusthey too betrayed it . And I had been filled with indignation over their treason . But was I myself not guilty of treason ? When I cried out , I no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been founded upon the respect for something present in every individual which it called Man . But I had let the notion of Man rot . I myself had confused Man with the individual . When I spoke of the community of men , I no longer knew what I was talking about . It might have been a slave market I was talking about ? for I saw my community as a mere numerical sum and not as a Being . I looked upon it as a mere phenomenon of nature . Stones in the rock pile are meaningless ; they are endowed with meaning by the cathedral they constitute . Men in the mass are meaningless ; they are endowed with dignity by the existence of Man . It was because of this that my civilization had ever and always striven to reveal Man to men , to define that universal being , Man . And Man , exalted as the object to be revered by the individual , in turn exalted the individual . It was Man as a quality inherent in each individual that my civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand this when I myself no longer understood it ? When I myself had ceased to speak of the rights of Man and was mouthing phrases about the rights of the collectivity , of the mass ? Here and there I and my kind had still retained a vague notion of the truth . We still agreed , for example , that a hundred men ought to risk their lives to save the life of a single miner entombed ; and that if ten of those men died , their death was nevertheless profitable , since they died paying homage to Man . And we recognized that the miner rescued could be called upon to help rescue another miner entombed ? since it was not he , the individual , who had been saved , but Man in his person . Yet little by little I had forgotten Man . My civilization had declared that all men were equal . But when I forgot Man I ceased to know the meaning of my words . Men are equal in something . Stones are equal in the cathedral . The soldier and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal in Man . It is this specific equality that demands of the physician , however distinguished he may be , that he risk his life in the treatment of a plague-infested nobody . That nobody is not an individual , he is a representative of Man . It is not as a political individual , or an economic individual , but strictly as a human being that he is the object of the physician 's care , and the equal of the physician . My civilization forbade me to enslave men , which is to say , enslave Man . It forbade me to put any obstacle in the way of the upward striving of the individual , which is to say , prevent Man , present in the individual , from ennobling the human race and enriching the human community by his creation . Man makes a choice of this or that individual as the vessel of Man 's expression , and I have no right to bar the passage of that vessel . True equality is equality in respect of the rights possessed by Man present in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every individual is free in it to enunciate the new verity that has taken shape in his consciousness , to bring forth the new poem , the new theory , the new song born in him . No tyrant may constrain him to silence . For through him it is Man that creates . But my civilization also guaranteed the individual agair.st the tyranny that might be exercised by the sum of other individuals . It is intolerable that a single individual should oppress thP mass . But it is also intolerable that the mass crush out the creative impulse of Man at work in a single individual . But I , forgetting Man , defined my liberty by asserting that it must stop at the point where it does injury to the liberty of my neighbor . This seeming ideal is void of meaning , for in fact no man canact without involving other men . If I , being a soldier , mutilate myself , I am shot . An isolated individual does not exist . He who is sad saddens others . But above all , forgetting Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to draw our substance from a whole greater than ourselves , receive our significance from it , we must first see that it exists . Mar , must give before he can receive , and build before he can inhabit . The gift to something greater than oneself is what my civilization called sacrifice . If I insist upon giving only to myself , I shall receive nothing . I shall be building nothing of which I am to form part , and therefore I shall be nothing . And when , afterwards , you come to me and ask me to die for a cause , I shall refuse to die . My own cause commands me to live . Where is that rush of love that will compensate my death ? Man dies for a home , not for walls and tables . Man dies for a cathedral , not for stones . Man dies for a people , not for a mob . Man dies for love of Man , if Man is the keystone in the arch of a community . Man dies for that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery here that is like the mystery of the infant 's milk . The mother gives to the child . By her giving , she creates her love . To create love , we must begin by sacrifice . Afterwards , it is love that makes the sacrifices . But it is we who must take the first step . When I took off for Arras I asked to receive before giving . My demand was in vain . We must give before we can receive , build before we can inhabit . By my gift over Arras I created the love that I feel for my kind as the mother creates the breast by the gift of her milk . At first the heart is a desert . The child smiles , and the heart is filled . I came back from Arras , having woven my ties with my farmer 's family . By the smile of his niece I saw the wheat of my village . By the aid of my village I saw my country . By the aid of my country , all other countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has chosen Man as the keystone in its arch . I came back to take my place in Group 2-33 , the Group that had volunteered to fight for Norway . I came back to be one of those who are made richer ? not poorer ? by the wealth of other countries . The web that is strong has no fear of diversity ; it delights in the variety of the strands that compose it . In the ages of faith the cathedrals were able to absorb gargoyles as easily as saints into their canticle . Tulips are grown in Holland , flamencos are sung in Spain , Christmas is snowy in Norway ? and by all these I am enriched , for I partake of Man . I dressed this day for the service of a god to whose being I was blind . Arras unsealed my eyes . Like the others of the Group , I am no longer blind . It may be that tomorrow Alias will order me to fly still another sortie . If , at dawn tomorrow , I fight again , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the war is already lost , but for self-fulfillment . My eyes have been unsealed , and I want now to remember what it is that they have seen . I feel the need of a simple Credo so that I may remember . I believe in the submission of the individual to Man and of the particular to the universal . I believe that the cult of the universal exalts and heightens our particular riches , and founds the sole veritable order which is the order of life . A tree is a unit despite the diversity of its roots and branches ; it is an object of order . I believe that the cult of the particular is the cult of death , for it founds its order upon likeness . It mistakes identity of parts for unity of Being . This is why every foreign way of life , every foreign people , every foreign thought is to it an affront . Its order comes merely to this , that it destroys the cathedral solely to line up the stones in orderly rows . Therefore I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular way of life upon other ways of life , a particular people upon other peoples , a particular race upon other races , a particular system of thought upon other systems of thought . I believe that the primacy of Man founds the only equality and the only liberty that possess significance . I believe in the equality of the rights of Man inherent in every man . I believe that only liberty makes possible the creations of Man through the instrument of the individual . Equality is not identity . Liberty is not the exaltation of the individual against Man . I shall fight against all those who seek to subject the liberty of Man either to an individual or to the mass of individuals . I believe that what my civilization calls Charity is the sacrifice granted Man for the purpose of his own fulfillment . Charity is the gift made to Man present in the mediocrity of the individual . It fulfills man . Symbolically , on Maundy Thursday the bishop washes the feet of the poor . There is no worship of the individual in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it speak to us neither of inferiority nor of demagogy . They exalt the individual solely in the fact of recognizing Man present in his person . I shall fight against all those who , maintaining that my charity pays homage to mediocrity , would destroy Man and thus imprison the individual in an irredeemable mediocrity . I shall fight for Man . Against Man 's enemies ? but against myself as well . XXVI We collected again at midnight to receive orders . Group 2-88 was sleepy . The flame in the fireplace had turned to embers . The Group seemed to be holding up still , but this was an illusion . Hochede was staring glumly at his precious watch . Penicot stood against a wall in a corner , his eyes shut . Gavoille , sitting on a table , his glance vacant and legs hanging , was pouting like a child about to cry . The doctor was nodding over a book . Alias alone was still alert , but frighteningly pale , papers before him under the lamplight , discussing something in a low voice with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture . The major was talking . Geley was nodding his head and saying , Yes , of course . ' Geley was hanging on to that Yes , of course ' by main strength . He was clinging more and more eagerly to the major 's discourse , like a half-drowned man to the neck of a swimmer . Had I been Alias I should have said without a change of voice , ' Captain Geley , you are to be shot at dawn , ' and waited for the answer . The Group had not slept for three nights . It stood like a house of cards . The major got up , went across to Lacordaire , and pulled him out of a dream in which perhaps he was beating me at chess . Lacordaire ! You take off at dawn . Ground-scraper sortie . ' Very good , Major . ' Better get some sleep . ' Yes , Major . ' Lacordaire sat down again . The major went out , drawing Geley in his wake as if he were a dead fish on the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days since Geley had been to bed . Like Alias , not only did he fly his sorties , but he carried part of the burden of responsibility for the Group . Human resistance has its limits : Geley seemed to have crossed his . Yet there they were , the swimmer and his burden , going off to the Staff for phantom orders . Vesain , the skeptical Vesain , asleep on his feet , came teetering over to me like a somnambulist : ' You asleep ? ' I had been lying back in an armchair ( for I had found an armchair ) and was indeed dropping off . But Vesain 's voice bothered me . What was it he had said ? ' Looks bad , old boy . . . Categorically blocked . . . . Looks bad . . . You sleep ? ' I. . . . No . . . . What did you say looks bad ? ' The war , ' he said . That was news , now ! I started to drop off again and murmured vaguely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What war " ! ' The major flung open the door and called out , ' All set ! We move out tonight ! ' Behind him stood Geley , wide awake . He would put off his ' Yes , of course ' until tomorrow night . Once again he would somehow find a reserve of strength in himself to help him with the wearying chores of our removal . The Group got to its feet . The Group said , ' Move again ? Very good , sir . ' What else was there to say . There was nothing to say . We should see to the removal . Lacordaire would stay behind and take off at dawn . If he got back he would meet us at our new base . There would be nothing to say tomorrow , either . Tomorrow , in the eyes of the bystanders , we would be the defeated . The defeated have no right to speak . No more right to speak than has the seed .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
