txt By Wireless to Tom New Yorx Timm . WITH AMERICAN THIRD ARMY , in Germany , Dec. 10 ? There was one part of Sarregtiemines today that sounded and looked like a Coney Island shooting gallery . The proverbial bull in the china shop was a well-mannered lamb compared with the GI 's and two companies of Germans battling for the possession of a ceramic plant . For four hours the crash of crockery , vases and porcelains could be heard above the rat-atat-tat of machine guns , as elements of the American Thirtyfifth Infantry Division fought from behind pottery-molding machines , crates of dishes and anything else that would afford protection . The Jerries had first started to defend the plant from the doorways and windows , but after they , had been driven inside the factory the real battle began . Fire could be expected from any quarter . It was no time for a connoisseur of ceramics to start appraising , or even admiring , the pottery , because death might lurk Just behind it . The advance was made from crate to crate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as each round was fired . It was serious business but the interposed shattering of pottery gave the battle a slapstick under // tone that added zest where it would least be expected . The grand finale came with a bang when , to rout the Germans from prepared positions , it was necessary to use hand grenades . It was then that the china shop bull was eclipsed once and for all . The destruction , chaos , bedlam and monumental clatter that followed within the four walls of the plant was something ' that the few who took part in this strange engagement will never forget . When the battle ended there was little pottery left and few Ger- ' ans , except those who had been captured , wounded or killed . Maybe the enraged bull could have , duplicated the destruction but I there are a good many GI 's from the Second Battalion of the 137th 1 Infantry Regiment , commanded by Lieut . Col. George T. O'Connell of Emporia , Kan. , who will always doubt it . Germans Ambush Troops The factory was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense of the eastern end of the city . As our forces approached they ran into ambush just outside the plant and were pinned down for some time with fire concentrated on them from half a dozen points . After the troops had been properly deployed for an attack Tech . Sgt. Michael J. Padiaro of Chicago led a platoon in a frontal assault on the factory while First Lieut . Robert Webster of Bloomsbury , Pa. , took another platoon around to the rear . Upon reaching the interior they found that the plant was a series of buildings with connecting tunnels . It was through these tunnels that the first phase of the battle was fought . The Germans were driven out of the first building at the outset , but staged a counterattack that might have been successful , except that Sgt. Donald W. Park of Baltimore , Md. , commanded a tunnel entrance and threw the charging Germans into chaotic retreat with hand grenades . Right after this point hand-tohand encounters started and the battleground reached the pottery department . Lieutenant Webster said his men were throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pulling the pins on the genades while others hurled them . The final count on German casualties was forty-three dead and twenty-seven captured . SS Men Discard Uniforms The troops who won the factory have had a rugged time ever since they reached Sarreguemines , which is still partly in German hands . We hold only a portion of the eastern end of the city and the Germans are fiercely contesting every inch of ground . The city is just south and slightly east of Saarbruecken , capital of the province , and is but a stone 's throw from the German border , which juts downward here like a finger pointing southward . Virtually every type of resistance has been met , including mines , booby traps , heavy artillery and bombings , from the vanishing Luftwaffe . But Germany 's latest secret weapon , which has appeared here for the first time , was an SS sniper dressed as a civilian . This lethal weapon , which has a high degree of accuracy , was discovered today when several of them were captured , and subsequently investigation uncovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform to civilian clothes . Under the rules of war they are spies and can be treated as such .
