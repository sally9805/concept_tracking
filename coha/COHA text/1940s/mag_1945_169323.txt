The American Rangers were always expendable . They were the Army 's cestus in punch after armed punch on the slogging road across North Africa , in the invasions of Sicily and Italy . Black-haired , chunky , 34-year-old Colonel William Orlando Darby , who had organized the Rangers in Northern Ireland during the anxious summer of 1942 , stayed with them through thick &; thin . <P> West Pointer Darby was a soldier 's soldier , undismayed by his command 's suicidal missions , full of cool recklessness and the yeast of humor and enthusiasm . At Gela , with 18 blackfaced men , he caught 52 Italian officers holed up in a hotel , unhesitatingly went in with grenades and automatics , killed or captured all . Once , with one companion , he took on a tank with a .50-caliber machine gun and knocked it out . <P> He fought in front of his men , was thrice wounded , ten times decorated ( e.g. , D.S.C. , British D.S.O. , French Croix de Guerre , Russian Order of Kutuzou ) , became a figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new commands . But finally , last summer , his Rangers were withdrawn from combat-of 1,500 original members of three battalions , only 199 were still alive . <P> Bill Darby , assigned to a War Department desk job in Washington , itched to go back to combat . When General " Hap " Arnold took an inspection party to Europe last month , he went along . In Italy he headed for the headquarters of the 10th Mountain Division-its assistant commander had just been wounded . He got the job , went happily back into action at the head of a combat team . But his fabulous luck had only eight days to run . Last week , shortly before German resistance crumpled , Bill Darby was killed by a German 88-mm. shell .
