Last week Marshal Henri Philippe Ptain . France 's earnest Catholic Chief of State , drafted a decree which he hopes will keep French home fires banked if not burning . <P> There will be no more quick divorce in the France that Vichy rules . Instead of allowing couples 20 days to think things over before divorce , the new law will require two years for an attempted reconciliation . <P> A Ministry of Justice spokesman denied that Marshal Petain 's new decree was dictated by religious considerations , insisted it was one more effort to halt the downward spiral of France 's birth rate . <P> While Vichy was encouraging human procreation in Unoccupied France , German-occupied Paris cracked down on animal increase . The Society for Protection of Animals asked owners to prevent their cats and dogs from mating . Reason : food is so scarce that Paris pets are already starving .
