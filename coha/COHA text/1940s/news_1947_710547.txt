txt Abroad . The Promise Hidden in the Atom Bomb By ANNE O'HARE McCORMICRThe only use of atomic power the world has so far seen is the destruction wrought by the atom bomb . Scientists in many countries know how to explode the atom , and the United States knows how to make the bomb . There the thing rests in the mind of the general public . For two years now the smoke of the holocaust of Hiroshima has sha , dowed men 's thinking with a fog of fear . The unsuccessful effort of the United Nations to secure international agreement on control of the atom bomb causes more widespread alarm than the deadlock in the peacemaking or Russia 's refusal to participate in a joint endeavor for European recovery . In the general view the Soviet Union 's will to cooperation and peace is revealed in its attitude on this issue more than in economic and political policies . In his ignorance of anything but its effects , about the only questions the ordinary layman asks about atomic energy are : How soon will Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be said in passing that even Mr. Molotov must find it hard to explain why the second question is never asked of the United States . Everybody knows we have the bomb and nobody worries about our using it . It is not fear of the United States that keeps Europe in a state of jitters and prevents the eastern states from taking independent , action . For Purposes of Peace All the man in the street knows about atomic power is that it makes war more dreadful . He has heard a great deal about its immense potentialities in the works of peace , but to date the councils of the world have discussed nothing but its military application . Yesterday came the announcement from Chairman David E. Lilienthal that the United States Atomic Energy Commission is about to establish a bureau of medical research to study the . beneficial uses of atomic energy . The board of independent medical men who made the survey for this project assures us that the benefits man will derive from the application of atomic power to his life , comfort and health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it appears that for the present the program will be mainly to protect the public against the effects of radio activity . " The need for medical and biological research on the various effects of radioactive substances and atomic fission is both urgent and extensive , " says the report . " It is urgent because of the extraordinary danger of exposing living creatures to radioactivity * * * and because effective defense measures ( in the military sense ) are not yet known . " It goes on to say that , since the commission has an absolute monopoly of new and powerful resources of knowledge for research , it has an obligation to share the results with the scientific world " whenever security considerations permit . " The French meantime  --  perhaps because they have not yet acquired the know-how to manufacture atomic bombs  --  are preparing to construct near Versailles what Joliot-Curie , high commissioner of atomic energy , calls an " atomic village , " an experimental laboratory to study all the problems and possibilities of this new source of energy . In an article in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort of the United States has so far produced only bombs . He quotes the late Paul Langeyin to describe the aim of the French enterprise : " I recently calculated that a single cargo vessel bringing 10,000 tons of uranium to France would make possible the production over the period of a century of ten times the amount of electric and thermic energy of which we now dispose . " What Could Happen " In the present state of the world , " Senator , former chairman of the Senate Committee on Atomic Energy , declared in a broadcast yesterday that this country has no choice but to continue manufacturing bombs . Experimentation and research for peacetime uses will go on , he said , but unfortunately we have to put the main emphasis on the production of weapons . This is just one of many vicious circles in which the world is caught . If science and skill could concentrate on developing atomic power for constructive purposes , the problems half of Europe will try to tackle at next week 's conference would have a very different aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a substitute for coal were in prospect . The struggle for manpower , waterways , sources of electric energy , would be immeasurably eased if every nation could put nuclear energy to work . No single thing would do so much to change the direction of men 's minds as the thought of atomic power as a savior instead of a destroyer . If one nation could give even a small demonstration of the miracles of healing and enriched life hidden in the capsule that now stands for death , it would do more than any other gesture to dispel fears , revive hopes and create the first condition . of peace .. The great value of the Marshall proposal was in shifting the emphasis from war to reconstruction . We who possess the atom bomb can not surrender it as a weapon until it is put under effective international control . But we might bring this control nearer if we were the first to exhibit the other uses of atomic power . As a promise as well as a threat , ht would be a double argument for cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
