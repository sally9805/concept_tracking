At the annual livestock convention in Toronto 's Royal York Hotel last week , the big talk was about Holsteins . The Holstein-Friesian Association of Canada reported that in 1948 , its best year yet , registered sales of purebred Holsteins reached a record total of 61,539 ( there were all sorts of guesses on how many more sales went unregistered ) . Almost half of the animals had been exported , the largest number to the U.S. , whose big demand for Holstein and other breeding stock has made Canada a leading exporter in the business . The rest went to 18 different countries , most of them in Latin America . <P> On the convention floor , breeders buzzed about an export deal that made 1949 look even more promising . Just a few days before , on his first trip to Canada , a Chilean cattleman named Jos Barros had agreed to pay Hays Ltd. , Canada 's largest exporter of Holsteins to the south , a whopping $79,340 for 15 purebreds , including a $15,000 bull named Sonniwilk Sovereign . <P> The man most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Chilean-raised , U.S.-trained salesman for Hays named Eladio Susaeta . His first employer , a rich Chilean rancher , sent him north to study animal husbandry at the University of California . Susaeta wrote his boss what he learned about milk-rich Holsteins , convinced him that milk could be as profitable as the beef on which Latinos concentrated . Returning with a B.S. in 1917 , Susaeta brought several head along with him . He later stocked a ranch of his own with los Holsteinos , began promoting them far &; wide . Ultimately he gave up as a breeder , decided to become a broker . <P> The owners of Hays Ltd. , two brothers named Tom and Harry Hays , first met Eladio Susaeta in 1940 when he came to Canada looking for clients . Five years later he was on their payroll . Since then Susaeta has made two trips a year through the hemisphere , has sold Holsteins from Puerto Rico to Argentina . Venezuela and Uruguay are his steadiest customers . Elsewhere sales have increased in direct ratio to urbanization , which has boosted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were n't for the dollar shortage he could sell $500,000 worth of Holsteins to Chileans alone . Chile has done as much as it could to help . This year it raised the permissible limit on dollars for purebred imports by 100% . Unfortunately for Salesman Susaeta , he has already almost filled the resulting $100,000 limit , and still has eleven months to go .
