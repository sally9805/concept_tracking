It began in silence . At 4 o'clock one morning a drizzle started in a big section of the Texas Panhandle . There was no wind . The temperature hovered at the freezing point , barely above , barely below . Fog , rain &; sleet froze on trees and telephone wires . By noon trees in Amarillo were groaning with the weight of ice on their limbs . By midnight three-fourths of the town 's telephone circuits were useless . By 1:30 the next afternoon the power lines were down . Western Union lost 800 poles , 2,000 crossarms , had 100,000 wire breaks . In Amarillo 100 telephone poles toppled ( throughout the storm area , 2,200 ) . Radio towers went down . When electric power failed , Amarillo 's water supply went dry , for 10,000,000 gallons stored underground could not be pumped to the surface . Amarillo 's fire department , answering many false alarms , had only enough water for 15 minutes of real fire fighting . <P> Still no winds blew . The cold was not intense . Like some legendary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Amarillo sank quietly , irresistibly deeper &; deeper beneath its sheath of ice , until it was cut off from the outside world . Now and then a lonely radio amateur got through with some word . The nerves of civilization quietly parted . Wide clean streets became tangles of wires . Forty-year-old trees , planted and cared for as trees are cared for only in the plain country , groaned and creaked all through the night , booming as they split open . <P> The Texas Panhandle is a high ( 4,000 ft. ) plateau , famed for its freakish weather , its cities that rise abruptly above the plain , its ranches , wheat and oil fields . It is so flat and landmarks are so rare that around Amarillo ( pop . 52,000 ) early settlers plowed furrows from settlement to settlement to guide travelers across the trackless , treeless expanse . One such furrow was about 150 miles long . It was so bleak that an army officer who explored it in 1849 reported : " This country is , and must remain , uninhabited forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texans said , " There 's nothing but a sagging barbed-wire fence between Amarillo and the North Star . " <P> Meteorologists explained that a low pressure area trapped over southern New Mexico by a high pressure to the north and northeast caused the storm last week . Temperature two degrees higher would have stopped the ice . A high wind would have broken the spell . But for 48 hours nothing happened . The region seemed deserted . An airline pilot making the first flight over the Panhandle two days after the storm reported that there were no signs of life , no cars on the highways and no trains seen operating , only a few lights showing in Amarillo 's business district . <P> Then a slight warm wind arose . In four hours the ice was gone . There were no major catastrophies , no fires of consequence , no deaths . Amarillo stirred like a somnambulist awakening , estimated its damages in the millions . Four days passed before telephone and telegraph communications made Amarillo once again part of the outside world .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
