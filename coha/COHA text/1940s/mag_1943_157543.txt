The American Scene was under ludicrous attack again last week . Cartoonist Whitney Darrow Jr. , for ten years a comic ornament to The New Yorker , published his first collection of drawings , You 're Sitting on my Eyelashes ( Random House ; $2.50 ) . In the title cartoon a raucously artificial brunette addressed a startled gentleman who had just taken her seat at the movies . <P> Most of Darrow 's cartoons stick to urban life and the middle class - which he treats with a ridicule heavily touched with fondness . Darrow 's favorite subjects include the laughable aspects of human underwear , the drastic results of heavy , middle-aged drinking , and the leering onset of sex in very small Boy Scouts ( " Would you like to come up and look at my merit badges ? " ) . Sometimes Darrow strikes a fine fantastic strain of social criticism . There is , for example , his classic comment on the profit motive . An incredibly cushy plutocrat sits in deep torpor and upholstery and hands a newspaper to his butler : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take it out and sell it . " Other Darrow scenes : <P> &gt;A nursemaid reading a bedtime story to enthralled five-year-olds ( " Coked to the gills , Beardon lunged toward the supine figure on the red-plush couch " ) . <P> &gt;A dashing young matron addressing her young son ( " Your father and I are now separated , Robert . After this you will please refer to him as ' that heel ' " ) . <P> Whitney Darrow Jr. , a thin , neat , nervous young man of 34 , is the son of a vice president of Charles Scribner 's Sons . The cartoonist went to Princeton ( ' 31 ) , there art-edited the Princeton Tiger . He sold his first drawings to Judge , College Humor and the old Life . After college he studied at Manhattan 's famed Art Students League under Thomas Hart Benton . Says Darrow of this training : " He taught me how to roll Bull Durham cigarets . " Darrow 's first New Yorker appearance was a study of two girl nudists admiring a male fellow nudist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serge suit . Zowie ! "
