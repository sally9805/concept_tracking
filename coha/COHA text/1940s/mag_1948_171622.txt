In the ordinary way-through the mails -a handsomely tailored magazine last week went to 4,000 subscribers in the U.S. , 7,000 in Britain and 9,000 elsewhere . But that was the only ordinary thing about Future . The editors had assembled their copy in London , had it set in Prague , and flown proofs to Britain for correction . After a three-week delay ( while Communists nationalized the Prague plant ) , Future had gone to press in Czechoslovakia . <P> Roly-poly Wolfgang Foges ( rhymes with bogus ) , the effervescent Viennese refugee who founded Future , had had to do it this hard way . To save paper , Britain 's Board of Trade bans new magazines , but encourages them to print abroad-provided they sell only on subscription and keep off Britain 's newsstands . <P> Two-year-old Future has built itself ( at $1 a copy in the U.S. , $1.20 abroad ) a circulation of 20,000 . Patterned after FORTUNE and aimed at the managerial class , Future 's slick paper and color layouts make it the best dressed among Britain 's dowdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which gets around the government rules by donning stiff covers and calling itself a book , has better writing , a broader editorial outlook . ) <P> Escape . To Wolfgang Foges , 38 , Future is a show window for a resourceful printing company known as " Adprint , " which is backed by Britain 's potent chemical firm , C. Tennant Sons &; Co . Ltd . Tennant helped Foges get out of Vienna shortly before the Anschluss ; he had already made a name as editor of a youth magazine at 17 , a fashion magazine at 23 . <P> Under the Tennant wing , Foges founded Adprint in 1937 , and made it a refugee rendezvous . It printed playing cards and catalogues , supplied teams of experts to produce books in " packages , " all ready for publishers to bring out . Its cheap ( $1 ) Britain in Pictures series sold 4,000,000 copies , ran to 120 volumes covering everything from windmills to cricket . <P> Invasion . Last month Foges secured a beachhead in the U.S. He reorganized Chanticleer Press , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall Chanticleer will invade the U.S. market with children 's books , nature books , a series on American furniture , silver , etc . <P> Most Foges enterprises make money , but Future is still in the red , thanks to its printing costs - $1.20 a copy . Nevertheless , it will grow from a quarterly to eight issues this year , go monthly in 1949 . It can not look forward yet to printing in England , but it is getting closer to home . Last week , things being what they were in Czechoslovakia , Foges &; Co. planned to transfer their production to Holland .
