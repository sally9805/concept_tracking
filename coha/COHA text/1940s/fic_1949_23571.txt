No Boat for Four Months A Story by Maxence Van Der Meersch Translated by Georges Surdez and illustrated by Tracy Sugarman , T HE island was very small , a platform of volcanic rocks a few degrees north of the Equator in the Indian Ocean . But its importance as a strategic point , as a French naval and air base , had increased suddenly because of the international tension . I reported for duty there a few months after September 1938 , after " Munich , " and as assistant medical officer I had the job of watching over the health of the Senegalese battalions laboring at the defense works . Elongated from east to west , the island afforded a roadstead sheltered by a jetty . This jetty was being finished at emergency speed . Inside was a passage with listening posts against submarines and a pipeline to service ships and tankers outside the port itself . The dike was formed by enormous cement-filled caissons . Three diving-bells were on the bottom constantly , connected to the pumps by large air hoses . In these bells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifts of two hours , naked to the waist , closed in like bugs in a bubble . These Negro soldiers , tirailleurs , were all robust chaps , selected from the elite of their magnificent race . They did not look as if they needed my services . At the eastern end of the island , at Port Clementine , less favorable for anchorage but better sheltered from the winds , Colonel Chavaigne was directing the construction of a flying field . Major Daiquin was in charge of our detachment . He was an old colonial officer , with a leathery , tanned , thin face , gray hair , and a sharp tongue . He immediately assigned an orderly to me , one of his best men , Baghi , a gigantic Senegalese who did my cooking , cleaned my shack , which was in the shade of a clump of coconut-palms , and set traps for the swarms of rats and mice that were eager to share my rations . He had his own method for this : a mess kit propped on a stick greased with bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mess kit dropped over them . And in the trimming , Baghi would turn them over to my dog , Diogenes , who delighted in snapping their spines . My shack was next to that of Major Daiquin , one hundred meters from the camp of the Negro troopers and their wives . There were no snakes . There were no mosquitoes because of the strong winds . But there were lizards and nasty black spiders , and ants without number , ants that could bite right through cloth . They would have tormented me at night had not Baghi , each evening , taken care to pour a little kerosene into the sardine cans in which the props of my camp cot were set . Thus isolated from the world , I enjoyed sound sleep . 0 N THE fourth day after my arrival , I was finishing my lunch , eating roasted ears of corn served for dessert . when I saw an old Ford touring car , coughing and rocking on high wheels , the black top a sort of majestic hood over the seat . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , leaped out . I went to meet him , holding the snarl- . NO BOAT FOR ing Diogenes by the scruff of the neck . The man walked towards me with quick steps . I noted the red velvet tabs on his collar , embroidered with the badge of the medical corps , and guessed who he was at once : my superior officer on an inspection tour . " Mon capitaine , " I greeted him formally . " Hello , Daurigny , " lie replied . " So ! You do n't know your schoolmates any more ? " I took another look at him . Under the white helmet , the thin , fine-featured face , creased and tired , quite yellow , sprouted a badly trimmed beard . It did not mean anything to me . But there were the eyes , gray , lively , intelligent , piercing , and his voice- " Vialez ? " " Of course . " A senior at medical school , an old comrade ! Yet I had not recognized him . People certainly did get old quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rather poor ? " He laughed a bit stiffly . " All right , all right . And so how are you here ? " He followed me into my quarters , inspecting them at a glance . " Not bad ! You 've already settled , I can see that . Daiquin must have given you an orderly up to his job ! Trust him  --  a queer old codger , that Daiquin , a rabid vegetarian , and a teetotaler on top of that , but just the same a wonderful guy ! By the way , I bring you an invitation to dinner , for Monday . The Colonel is entertaining . Sure , he is  --  what do you think we are here , savages ? Wants to meet you . Be there at six o'clock . You have some way of motoring ? Or do you wish me to fix it for you to be picked up ? It 's all of twelve kilometers . " " Well , I think Major Daiquin would be glad to lend me his motorcycle . " " Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of the road  --  not to mention that of the motorcycle  --  I 'd advise you to start at five . It would be wiser . " I We both laughed . " So , it 's understood . Follow the north road , on top of the cliff , beside the shore . Magnificent sight , you know , with the mangroves and the islets . But you 'll see for yourself . " He took out a cigarette case , offered it . " Do n't smoke ? Lucky chap ! " He sat on my bed and blew smoke into Diogenes ' nostrils . " And so ! Dld Daurignyl I 'll be damned if I 'd have believed that we 'd meet here some day . Eh ? " " Right . " " Getting used to things ? Not too much work ? " " Getting along fine . Matter of fact , not enough work . " " Of course not ! Those lads are regular Hercules . All you get are severe indigestions , most of the time because they wo n't chew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainy season , sometimes a decayed tooth . Can you extract a molar ? " " Well ? " " I 'll show you how . I 'll lend you a few forceps . For the fakers , a word of advice . You examine them , you take a very serious air and you prescribe a dose of castor oil . Watch out for their women  --  if you have the misfortune to smear one with iodine , you 'll have all the dames in the place after you . They 're crazy to get painted with the stuff  --  decorative , you know . " We smiled . " But you 'll make out . Your infirmary ? " " Pretty good . " " Did you keep Vimmerin as your orderly there ? Good . You can rely on him . Did you bring a few boxes for the pharmacy ? " " Yes . " " That 's wise . By the way , come to think of it , I need morphine . I have n't any more . Could you spare some out of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He looked at his watch . " Yes , I have time . Is that your dog ? " " Diogenes ? Yes . " " Why Diogenes ? Is he a cynic ? " " No . But he lives in a barrel . " " Ah ! Very good . " He laughed . We went out with Diogenes , to the shack of the infirmary , where Vimmerin , the orderly , met us and showed us around . I opened the padlocked little zinc chest where I kept my tins of morphine . " You have plenty ? " Vialez asked . " I can help myself ? " " See for yourself . " He took about half of my stock and said , " Keep that chest closed . " " ' Thieves ? " " No . Ants . Vimmerin , please make a package of this . Imagine your predecessor , on arriving here , had carefully placed his stuff on shelves . Well , one night , old man , the ants ate up all his labels ! Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he nearly went crazy , poor fellow ! Thanks , Vimmerin . " We went back to the car . He got in , placed the small package on the seat beside him . The motor turned over . Vialez held out his hand . " Then , Monday , agreed ? Just a minute  --  there 's something else . If you have any wounded , do n't throw away the dressings . Have them washed and disinfected . They can be used again . You often run short of things here . Naturally , with a boat only every four months . So long , old man ! " A friendly smile , then the Ford was off , with a quick leap , like a rabbit springing away . It left in a cloud of dust , with Diogenes racing after it . I went back into my shack , feeling pleased with the interview . T HE . next Monday , on the stroke of six , thanks to the smoky motorcycle loaned by Major Daiquin , I arrived at the Colonel 's . Port-Clementine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little town . The bungalow of the Colonel had a verandah , and in the spacious dining room , with orderlies changing our dishes and pouring the wines , I almost felt back in Europe . There I met Saint-Servais , the engineer in charge of works , Vialez , and the old and gentle Father Pothievres , chaplain of the tirailleurs . Vialez was brilliant . The wit , culture , polish of that fellow amazed me . Music , letters , sciences , nothing seemed strange to this physician . With Colonel Chavaigne , who had a passion for music which he fed with a splendid collection of records , he discussed an oratorio of Handel . A moment later , he was conversing with Father Pothievres on the Manicheans , then on Saint Augustine . Then he took an interest in Saint-Servais ' troubles with the dike . The speed and precision of his questions showed that , before anyone else , he understood a problem , saw difficulties . Toward the end of the meal , however , I had the impression that he was growing weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two or three times , he passed his hand over his forehead , as if ill at ease . I noticed a slight quivering of his eyelids , a sign of nervous fatigue . Behind him , his orderly , Mongis , watched him with visible concern . MAGAZINE Suddenly , in the middle of the conversation , Vialez rose and left the room . Mongis followed him . Five minutes passed . Then Vialez returned , oddly relaxed , smiling , and somehow stronger . He sat down , resumed the talk . He had recovered all his spirit , all his humor . Again , he was the life of the gathering . And a lightning thought , a terrible suspicion , crossed my mind . I remembered his call on me , what he had asked for  --  could it be possible ? And the more I looked at him the stronger my suspicions grew . His complexion , his thinness , that sudden fatigue wiped out in a short absence , everything , even to the worried expression of his orderly Mongis , who must know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scandal , a catastrophe  --  everything pointed to my having guessed right . Poor mortal ! We finished the evening on the verandah , facing the invisible sea , which we could hear in the long , sighing , endless crash of the rollers on the beach . We talked of the threat of war . Chavaigne alone was pessimistic . All the others , including myself , thought we would behold a gigantic game of poker , all bluff and outwaiting . I left Port Clementine about midnight . T ILE week that followed was exciting . Several accidents occurred . A crushed finger . A broken leg . And that fool of a Diogenes during a walk in the bush contrived to get bitten by a cobra . We returned in all haste , I injected twenty cubic centimeters of serum under the skin of his back , wrapped him in warm flannel , shot him full of heart stimulants . For three days and three nights , Baghi , my Senegalese , watched over the patient like a despairing father . The fourth day , stilt somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed hygenic duties satisfactorily , fussed around a while with his nose , selected for himself a few curative herbs and came back with his tail wagging . Everything was all right ! But we had worried . About four in the afternoon , I was preparing a good meal to build him up again , when steps sounded on the planking of the sidewalk before my shack . There was a knock on my door . " Come in . " NO BOAT FOR It was Vialez , a small parcel under one arm . " What good wind blows you in ? " I asked , a bit surprised . He looked around before answering , " Are you alone ? " " I think so . Baghi ! No . He is in the garden , working . " Vialez took off his helmet , wiped his fore-head , sat on the edge of the table . " I need you , Daurigny . " " At your service . " " I have something to tell you  --  to confide . You are a physician , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stayed three years in Saigon . I 've mixed with all sorts of people , I 've been in all kinds of places --  " I guessed what he was leading up to . There was worry and there was hope in my heart . He went on , " I was young . curious , avid of sensations . Wanted to know everything . A friend took me along --  " " I understand , " I murmured , " I understand very well , old man . " " To be brief and brutal about it , I am a drug fiend. 1 am saturated to the bone . " I made a vague gesture . I suffered for him having to make that confession . I stammered a few words of affection . " You know , it 's never too late , Vialez , when one has the will to --  " " I know , and I have the will . I have the will to cure myself . Help me , Daurigny . " " You want to be cured ? " " Yes . Your arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know each other , we were friends . I dare tell you anything . And you 're a doctor , you can keep check on me , take me in hand . You must save me , Daurigny . " I muttered , as moved as he was , " That 's good , that 's very good , Vialez --  " He took the parcel from the table . " Here 's the morphine . AlI of it . I did n't keep any . Not a single ampoule . Seeing that my intoxication is of long standing , we must have a progressive treatment . I 'll come here every day for my injection , every day , at the start . Then we 'll space it . Right ? " " Yes , " I agreed , " yes . " I was so upset that I did not know what to say or what to do . He took off his blouse , his shirt , bared his thin torso , pinched the skin on his arm , pulled it , let it go : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . So far , the heart is not hurt much . Listen for yourself . " I pressed my ear to his chest . Hardly a few slight irregularities . Vialez continued his own diagnosis , the physician was uppermost in him just then . " Constipation , of course , anorexia . From time to time , palpitations . But still very rare . Want to take a look at the retraction of the pupils ? " I took a look at his eyes and made a few notes . " All in all , " he concluded , " I think the balance is still on the credit side . " " That 's my definite opinion , " I agreed . " We 'll get out of this mess ? " " I 'm sure of that , Vialez ! You put yourself in my hands ? You become my  --  patient ? You 'll obey ? " He pointed to the parcel of ampoules . " That should prove something . " " Weil , you 're as good as cured . We 'll proceed descrescendo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little coffee as a substitute stimulant , laxatives  --  and in six months --  " I smiled at him . I wanted to give him confidence . I loved him with all my heart at that moment , for the faith he had in me , for the burden he brought on me . And I could see that I was doing him some good even then , bracing him up . Already , the physician yielded place to a sufferer , a sick man , a poor being who called me , who needed me , who hoped in me . He said in a shaky voice : " Aft ! My friend  --  if you get me out of this --  " I gripped his hands . " Do n't worry ! Everything will be fine . " " Yes , indeed , yes --  " He held on to my hands . He looked at me . And I went on smiling , to give him courage , that courage of which I now needed enough for two . What a magnificent trade ! V IALEZ visited me regularly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the injections grew widely spaced , every two days , then every three days . There were a few incidents , but nothing alarming . Like stomach cramps and deep intellectual depression at the start . Only once , after six whole days without a dose , there was a minor syncope , which forced us to resume injections for a time . I noted the excellent effects of castor oil which accelerated the expulsion of poisons liberated by the cells . My patient was docile , rather somber in MAGAZINE mood , depressed on the whole , despite the coffee I prescribed and of which he drank rather too much , which was understandable in his case . We did not talk at length . I felt him tight with concentration on himself , holding his grip to save energy . He suffered and he struggled . How well I understood ! His visits and my gardening were the only breaks in my life , oddly monotonous , as a colonial physician . Under my very eyes , without much visible change , immense and costly works inched ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sand separated my shack from the sea . Here was a steam shovel , there a huge crane , a little further , an elongated machine with buckets , used to scrape the mud . Afloat near the dike was a motionless dredge , held by anchors . All was rusty , hall sunk , rarely in motion , seemingly abandoned . A few Negro soldiers passed by , pick on shoulder , carrying tools . A tractor , squat and black , occasionally chugged by hauling a huge timber , like an insect towing a burden too large for its size . And all of it was minuscule , as if lost in immensity , in the dazzle of the violent light dropping from the sky , reflected and doubled by ' the white sand . It was hard to believe that this represented the spending of billions , so much effort and so much pain . " Our trade does n't show us off , " the engineer , Saint-Servais , once told me sadly . " All our effort is under the earth or water , buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's what counts . " I kept on with the treatment . Vialez was getting along better and better . One out of two injections , without telling him , I was using distilled water . He did not notice this . I figured that in two more months he would be saved . Then , as he had several accidents to keep him busy in Port-Clementine , I took to using the motorcycle to go and give him his shots . That allowed me , on August 15 , to witness a procession organized by Father Pothievres in honor of the Virgin Mary . I shall never for get that young Holy Virgin with her blacl ? skin , very moving nevertheless , with her beau tiful sincerity shining in her naive eyes , no that little barefooted Negro who incarnated for us , with his wooly hair and brown fact the most unexpected and touching Chili Jesus . NO BOAT FOR FF VERYTHING seemed to be going well , SO that I was surprised when , a few days later , Baghi came to the works to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the threat of war and the endless negotiations . " Lieutenant , " Baghi stated . " Major Vialez he be at infirmary . " I went there at the double . Vialez was in the little room used as a pharmacy . He was standing , waiting for me . He flicked his leggings with strokes of his chicotte , a sort of riding crop of thick hippo hide . " Ah , " he greeted me. - There you are at last ! " " What 's the good news ? " " Old man , I do n't feel good . Not good at all . " " Nonsense , " I tried to laugh . " What 's the trouble ? Dizzy spells ? " He cut me short with a gesture . " Listen , I 've had enough . I 'm going crazy ! I 'm suffering too much . Give me back my morphine ! I 'd sooner croak than live like this . " " Vialez ! Vialez ! You are not reasonable . Come ? " " No ! I 'm telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . So you ca n't know  --  I ca n't eat  --  I ca n't sleep , I 'm incapable of reading , writing , working , incapable of thought . Everything sickens me , everything exasperates me . I have only one thing in my head , only one thing , one idea , one desire , it 's a fixed idea , an obsession , madness , yes , and it will drive me mad , I 'm telling you ! " But that 's enough , see ? Life is not worth living after all , if you have to take this kind of thing . I 've made my choice . I 'd rather croak with a nice , soft , easy death . Give me back my ampoules , Daurigny . " When I did not answer , he resumed , " I appreciate all you 've done for me . I admit your efforts , admire your friendship , your affection . I regret everything . But I ca n't take it , old man , it is n't my fault . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were swell . " / did not speak , I did not move . " Come on , " he snapped . " Give me my poison . " As I still did not move he added , " Well , what are you waiting for ? " " Nothing , " I told him , " You mean --  ? " " Nothing . You know quite well I ca n't give you that stuff . " " Why not ? " " It 's not up to me to poison you . " " What 's that ? " " I am a physician . I must cure you . " " In spite of myself ? " " Even in spite of yourself ! " He laughed nervously , whipped his leggings with the crop . " What do you know about that ! You 're joking ? " " I 'm not joking . " " You wo n't give me back my morphine ? " " I do n't want to kill you ! " " You think you have a monopoly on dope ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of a few days  --  I 'll wait and you wo n't have achieved anything . " " You know better . You know that the next boat wo n't be here before four months . That is , if there is no war ! And four months from now , you 'll be cured . " " So , you want to play retriever at any cost ? " " At any cost ! " He dropped his casual tone and grew angry . " But , damn it , I 'm still my own boss ! I have the right to die if I want to ! " " It is n't my job to help you . " My quiet assurance proved disconcerting . He paced around that little room , in the green shade , like a wild beast . Then he whirled on inc violently . " It 's childish , come , it 's childish ! Whether I die from dope or a bullet through my brain , what does it matter to you ? It is none of your business , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But do n't ask me to supply the weapon . Moreover , I am sure you wo n't shoot yourself --  " " I wo n't kill myself ? " " No . You 've reached a crisis , Vialez , you are beside yourself , bewildered , furious . But , believe me , tomorrow you 'll be around to thank me . " " Enough of that , " he exploded . " Cut it out ! I do n't need a sermon ! For the last time , give me hack my morphine . " " No , " I retorted , firmly . " It is n't enough to say no , " he screamed . " It 's an order , do you hear ? No such thing as friends , now . It 's an order ! I'ni your superior officer , after all . You must obey ! " and he tapped the stripes on his cliff . " I am your chief ! Arid I order you --  " " Primarily , you 're my patient . There is no question of service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusted yourself to my care . You are my patient . On that ground , I deny you the right to give me an order . The chief no longer exists . " " It 's a refusal ? " " Clean-cur refusal . " " Very well ! But damn it , that morphine is mine ! You 're a crook ! I gave it to you ! You have no right to hold on --  " He tried to wound me , to lash me with insults , but I looked at him without answering . I wanted to remain calm , above him , so that nothing irreparable would occur between us , to get hold of him again later . I held on to myself with all my will . Then he headed for me , fists clenched , lifting the crop , shouting . " You robber , you dirty thief ! " I did not answer , impassive , with his clenched fist an inch from my face . I waited the blow . I decided not to strike back unless I was forced to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irreparable . Leave things so that you can take care of him later , tomorrow . I looked at him , mastering my rising anger mixed with fear , looked into that mad face , which wept , howled , foamed , spouted biting insults . " Thief ! Crook ! Coward ! Swine ! Ah  --  if I  --  you know  --  if I let myself go --  " and he raised the crop with a frenzied gesture . " Watch out , the dog ! Diogenes , here , Di-ogenes ! " Diogenes had slid silently from beneath a cot , legs bent , back bristling , ready to_the leap for his throat . My shout stopped him just in time . Vialez turned and saw the dog . It seemed as if the sight brought hack a flicker of sense , and a human light flashed in his eyes . He hesitated , then , furiously , he threw his crop into a corner , slumped on a chair , hid his face and wept . It was over , that crisis had passed : He felt nothing now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not answer . I brought him some cold coffee , offered him a cigarette . I walked with him back to his car . He followed like a child . He got in , took the wheel , and was off without another word . T HE war  --  always the war , coming nearer and nearer , the futile negotiations . My anxiety increased . That enormous dark cloud overhead kept me from thinking over-MAGAZINE much of Vialez . I thought I would see him the following day . Nothing . The day after , still no news . I would have liked to run over to Port Clementine , but Daiquin 's motorcycle had run its front tire into a spine bush and could not be used . I would have to wait for it to be repaired , and that would take time . Work on the dike was geared to a frantic pace . The coast batteries in their cement barbettes were tested daily . The two tugboats were painted gray , and so was the peaceful dredge , an unexpected glory . Daiquin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that dazzling , eternal sun before a sea that seemed sprinkled with diamonds , how could we imagine that great massacre to be possible ? The third day , after lunch , I was ready to take my siesta when the telephone rang . I was needed on the dike . An accident , I surmised . I took my kit and helmet and walked out rapidly under a sun strong enough to boil the brain inside one 's skull . Diogenes , heroic and resigned , accompanied me , his tongue lolling out , walking in my shadow . I found Daiquin bare-headed , directing the handling of a hoist . My arrival surprised him . " No , " he said , -I did n't call you . But never mind , I 'll walk back with you . You know the sensational news  --  a German-Soviet pact ! So get set . " Up at the infirmary , we discussed the possible consequences of , that startling bit of news . Then Daiquin said , - See here , a broken pane . Your pharmacy window is broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed . " And you know we 're short of glass here ! And if we do have war , you are likely to wait for your pane until the next armistice  --  we 'll be isolated here . live like savages , my friend  --  no boat , no nothing . " " Baghi , " I called the orderly , who cattle running . " You broke a pane , you ass ! " He opened his eyes in bewilderment . " Me no savvy , Lieutenant . " I gave him a dressing down . He took it Without protest , then went back to watch the heap of coals on which he was baking bread in an old biscuit tin . Daiquin went his way . I went into the infirmary to paste a paper over the empty pane . And immediately I noticed an empty space on a shelf . There was something missing  --  yes , that was right , the zinc box in which I kept the stock of mar-phine had vanished . A fraction of a second , I was as if stunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must have paid someone to  --  to steal -- The poor wretch , I thought . T RE wart There we were , isolated from our country , like a piece of France set adrift , like a besieged fortress . Every day now the naval guns practiced shooting . The Buffie , our big tugboat , towed the target out to sea , at the end of a long cable , and our coast artillery shelled it . From the dike we tried to follow the flight of the black birds of death flying and snoring toward the target . We would wait for the jet of foam out there , for the black smoke of the explosion , and then discuss the shots . Colonel Chavaigne and Saint-Servais came almost every morning to check the progress of the works . I was surprised on one occasion to find Vialez with them . He showed no embarrassment . He smiled , shook hands . His talk was alert , optimistic , careless , sparkling . One would have thought that nothing unusual had happened between him and me , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cause awkwardness . He understood very well that I was tied by professional secrecy , that , like fessor , I could do nothing but remain that I could not talk to anyone about even to him . But his orderly , Mongis , followed him with a worried glance , the glance of a faithful dog . And the man also looked at me . That fellow loved his chief . He hoped and expected me to do something . But what could I do ? What was odd was that it was I who felt ashamed before Vialez . ? ? GREAT silence had settled upon our island . The voices of the ships were no longer heard . Aside from a few coded messages , incomprehensible , the wireless was mute . The pouring of cement went on in port . The naval guns shelled sea and sky in practice barrages . Baghi lived in a state of excitement detrimental to his cooking . I promised , to ease his fever , to take him aboard the Buffle so that he could see the shells drop near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us started out , Baghi , Diogenes , and I , headed for the dike where the Buffie was steaming up and coughing stinking black smoke into the sky . We were halfway there when a sergeant came running after me , gesticulating and shouting . " Quick . come quick  --  an accident ! " We broke into a trot . Baghi took the lead , reached the spot first . A steam winch had snapped . There were two victims , a petty officer From the crew and a Senegalese soldier . Nasty wounds . And burns from scalding steam too . Splinters of iron in a belly . Stretchers . Infirmary . First aid . False optimism . " Right , fellow , do n't fret ! A matter of a few weeks in bed --  " Worry . Dull anguish and anxiety . Somber days . Sudden calls during the nights . Nocturnal walks between my shack and the infirmary . Tendency to be short-tempered with Diogenes and Baghi . All physicians are familiar with that condition . Their wives also ! Things did not go right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might pull through . But the Negro , Semba Madjou , aroused my fears . His wounds were hideous . The explosion had tossed him into the hold , and he had dropped astride the edge of an open barrel . Although I am toughened to it , I would sooner not dwell too long on that wound . Morphine , morphine , that 's all I could do . With only a few ampoules left in my stock , I wondered what I would do when that ran out . Two days passed . Three days . The thought came : if only Vialez would come . I was sure he had morphine , my morphine . But all that week , Colonel Chavaigne came alone , on horseback . That Saturday I learned that Daiquiri was going to Port-Clementine on his patched-up motorcycle . I asked him to take me in the sidecar . We rolled at a surprising speed , and I could n't get over Daiquin 's skill with that old motor . Ten times I thought we would drop over the cliff into the creeks running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed me high , he would turn his head an instant to ask , " Still there ? Good . " And he would drive on faster . We reached the chief engineer 's bungalow at last , thirsty , burned by the sun , dizzy from the wind . Major Daiquin scorned acid lemonades and was satisfied with a glass of water , water filtered through a wad of cotton-wool , and he laughed at Saint-Servais ' gasps of horror . As for me , I ran in haste to Vialez 's place , and found him relaxed in a steamer chair , smoking . He was surprised . " Oh , it 's you ? " " Yes  --  ou t for an airing  --  needed the change . " " Tired out ? " " Annoyed , rather ! Two patients that are n't getting along . " " Really ? " I told him about the accident , the condition of the two men . He listened , asked me a few details concerning the burns , the aspect of the wounds , the draining . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as Semba is concerned , there 's nothing to be done save shoot in the morphine  --  and that 's what bothers me ? " " I understand how you feel , " he agreed , " but when you 've surely done everything possible --  " " That 's not it , it 's just that I 'm going to run out of morphine . " " So ? " he breathed . Before his long glance of irony , I did not dare say more . Obviously , he did not believe me . His eyes followed me out , as he evidently thought , " Does n't work , old man ! " I felt embarrassed and furious at the same time . I left hastily . T wo days more passed . We heard that our troops had won some small successes in the Warndt Forest . Daiquin stamped with anger to he stuck out here while others were fighting . So far as I was concerned , the care of my patients took my mind from the general fever for news that burned everyone around me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I used up all my analgesics to gain a few days , but with poor results . I had to go back to morphine . " Two shots last night , " Vimmerin , the orderly , told me when I went over on Monday morning . " Go easy , Vimmerin , go easy . on , call me for the shots . His of the door , I ran into a woman with two little kids holding on to her cloth . They stepped in timidly  --  Madjou 's wife and two children --  All through that morning , worry weighed my heart . I went about aimlessly . I watched the working at the diving bell , but all I could think of was Madjou . At noon , I hardly touched my food , berated Baghi , and then made for the infirmary . Things were not so good . He was suffering . His poor face , drawn and almost grayish , turned towards me and he evidently expected from me , the white man , the magician , the all powerful white healer , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his suffering . Last joy and last triumph of a beaten physician  --  to give relief from pain . But that joy would not be mine for long . I hesitated  --  could n't he wait a while longer ? Then I heard him groan . No matter what , I could not resist the pleading in those eyes , the glance charged with suffering , hope , and imploration . I gave him a shot of morphine . Madjou , relieved , sank into torpor . All right , he would know a few hours of forgetfulness . But I counted my ampoules . There were only four left . " What about tonight , if he wakes up ? " Vimmerin pressed me . " Better leave me some of the stuff ? " " No . I 'll come back myself . " Throughout that afternoon filled with work and mechanical activities , I thought of little but my dying patient . At six o'clock , I was back at the infirmary . " How goes it ? " " He 's coming out of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left two ampoules for the night . I borrowed Daiquin 's motorcycle again and hurtled along the cliff road . I reached Port-Clementine . A servant squatted before Vialez 's shack , scouring copper pans with damp sand . He introduced me into the place and I found Vialez , his meal over , nibbling at peanuts and smoking at the same time . " What a pleasant surprise , " he said . " I need you , Vialez . " " Whatever for , old man ? " " A consultation . " " What 's up ? " " My patient is not doing well at all . " NO BOAT FOR He became serious , knocked the ash from his cigarette . " If my poor skill can be of use , Daurigny , you know --  " " Yes . " " All right ! I 'll be over tomorrow at noon . " " Make it in the morning , rather . " " Understood . " He had become grave and calm , for the physician in him was taking over . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seemed absorbed . I left him feeling strangely happy through my anguish  --  the real man was not quite dead in Vialez . I got back very late , went to the infirmary . All was quiet . I checked on the card  --  Vimmerin had given Madjou some morphine ! I went back to my shack and found that Diogenes had helped himself to my meal , carelessly left on the table by Baghi . All around , it had been a rotten day ! / WAS shaving in the morning when I heard a car outside . It was Vialez , already . We made for the infirmary . Vialez examined Semba Madjou , and I admired his concentration , his intelligence and sharp analysis as he bent over the dying man . And once again , I felt keen regret that such a  --  he beckoned to me and I followed him outside . " Well ? " " Done for . " " Nothing more to be tried , is there ? " " Nothing . " " Nothing , " I said , " except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vialez lighted a cigarette . I heard him mutter , " Poor devil ! " Then he added thoughtfully , " One wonders why , eh ? What 's the use of it all , eh ? Martyrdom and a frightful death for a poor slob of a Senegalese Negro , in the month of September 1939 , in a little island lost in the Indian Ocean . What 's the use of that in the monstrous history of this inhuman universe ? Eh , Daurigny ? " He laughed a terrible , bitter laugh . And I guessed his worry , his need to believe in something , behind his skepticism and his rebellion . I remembered a saying of Pascal , of which / understood for the first time the pathetic depth , " Pity the atheist who seeks . " Vialez wanted me to give him some answer , he wanted me to reply , " No , it is not useless . You are mistaken ! Everything serves , everything makes sense ! " But I was mute . I found nothing to say . Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What purpose will be served in the history of the world , by the obscure finish of this poor being ? And I myself felt a fierce anger . rebellion against that unexplainable suffering , against this man , Vialez , who had hurt me , and against myself , who had allowed myself to be shaken , lessened , who had lost a little of that faith , willed and necessary , so difficult to achieve and to preserve , faith in life and in destiny . " No matter what , " I said , " our duty is to soften his end . " " That 's sure . " " So , morphine . " He looked at me and I insisted , " No ? " " Oh , sure , " he murmured . " But , as I have already told you , I have no snore morphine . " He looked at me again , and his glance probed me to the soul , I pressed on . " I 'll snip off my last ampoule , tonight . " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saying not a word . He yielded to a vague gesture . I guessed the struggle inside him . I hoped . But he did not speak , gestured again helplessly . He shrugged , walked a few paces . He was escaping --  I realized then that I should have understood . It was impossible for him to turn hack . He could not give me back the morphine . It would have meant an admission too difficult for a man with his immense pride to make . And then , the stuff is his life , I thought , his food , his bread , the drug without which he can not continue , and that no ship can bring , now . In any case , how could he have told me to my face , " I stole ! " He walked ahead of me toward the car , and I let him go . He waited for me. and spoke of something or other , of the coming rainy season , of the resistance made by the Poles . But I did not answer . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was just as well . I would not get my morphine . I felt resentful , furious , desperate . With little more provocation , I would have spat out my hatred and disgust to his face . Yet I understood that he was also prisoner of an absurd situation without possible issue . In his place , what would I have done ? That dirty dope is his whole existence  --  and could I have admitted , myself , in his place , " I am a thief ! " He got into his Ford and rolled away . I went home . r-ri HERE followed another day of shuttling 3 between the port and the infirmary . The dying man was suffering . And I had only one ampoule left . I wanted to keep it for the night , because suffering is always harsher at night . I would be able to ease him just once more  --  then what ? What would I do with the poor creature who clung to me , who had faith in me , who was eased by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the might of the great white physician . l read all that in his eyes . His face split into a smile when I appeared . He suffered less . He panted and tried to keep smiling , waited for me to speak to him , to touch him , to ease him . Always , until that time I had managed to do something , to stop his torment , to push away suffering , to achieve , for an instant , the miracle , the poor miracle of erasing his pain , to bring him some sleep , to make him forget a while . And it happened that this would be no longer possible : with terror I saw the time coming when I would not be able to do anything , when I would have to watch his martyrdom , powerless to help  --  I would have to listen to his calls As the day progressed , Semba Madjou became more awake , more lucid , suffered more . I hardly left his side . When I was away from him , I thought of him all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six o'clock . It was time . He was worn out with suffering . Instantly , he fell asleep . " What about tonight ? " Vimmerin asked me . " Finished , " I said . " I have none left . " " No more morphine ? " " No . " " So then what ? " " He 'll sleep until midnight . At midnight , I 'll be back . " I leave the bewildered Vimmerin , my nerves quivering . " I 'll be back . " Yes , I 'll be back at midnight  --  but what will I do ? Live his agony with Madjoul A physician must have courage . Just the same , I have not much . I did not touch my meal , the braised bananas served by Baghi . I wound up my alarm clock , set it for fifteen minutes before twelve . I sat upon my bed , unlaced my leggings , and remained there , stupid , inert , thinking , thinking . Dlogenes was worried , he came to push his head tinder my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He annoyed me , and yet I would have liked to confide in him . I needed someone to talk to  --  but Diogenes was merely an animal , could not have understood . I was ready to break down and cry . What a hell of a profession  --  medicine . I took off my boots , put the clock under my pillow and stretched out on the cot . Diogenes settled under it . The tick-tock of the alarm clock , like a regular pulse , beat into my ear . One , two , three , four  --  one , two , three , four ? D IOGENES started to bark furiously . Vio- lently torn from my sleep , I opened my eyes in the darkness , sat up , listened a second and rose . Diogenes deafened me with his barks . " Peace ! You fool , shut up , Diogenes , " I lighted my lamp . I listened . There was the noise of a motor outside . It stopped , a door slammed . Steps . Someone was coming to fetch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my boots , my leggings . Then the door opened brusquely and , bewildered , I recognized the tall silhouette of Vialez in the doorway . He was livid , and he stammered . " It 's me , only me  --  forgive me for  --  at this time of night --  " " Come in . " " How is he ? " " How is who ? Ah , yes . He 's sinking fast . No change . You came just for that ? " Awkwardly , Vialez placed a parcel on the table . " I  --  well  --  there  --  there 's the morphine . " That struck me like a blow in the chest . I looked at him , unable to speak . He added in a low voice , " I used up four tins . The rest is there  --  all of it --  " My throat tightened , but I managed to say , " That  --  that  --  Vialez  --  that 's swell  --  that 's very swell ? " He resumed , with embarrassment and shame in his voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my treatment  --  if you agree ? " I answered flatly , stupidly , " At your serv-ice . " " All right . It 's a deal . Well , so long --  " He took a step to leave , turned hack . Then he checked a gesture he did not dare finish , which I guessed . So , although he was my chief , I touched his shoulder , I slapped his shoulder , and I held out my hands . " Thanks , Vialez . " Then he collapsed . He sank on a chair , dropped his face in his hands , and sobbed . " Vialez , Vialez ! " I ran to him , slapped his shoulder again , bewildered , lost . " Vialez , please ! Vialez ! Do n't cry ! You 'll he all right now , you 're safe ! " But he hid his face and sobbed on . He muttered . " Ah , old man , old man ! If you knew how sick of myself I am ! Letting a man suffer ! Me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am ! Slob ! Slob ! " For his great , his only remorse was that  --  it was not the theft and the lying , nor his miserable passion  --  he felt remorse because he , a physician , had left a patient to suffer S E MB A MADJOU died three days later . Vialez and I went to see him for the last time . He was on a cot at the infirmary . His poor face was drawn and thin , a dark , dingy , gray against the white of the pillow . But his naive , childish face had achieved a grave dignity in death which impressed me . Yet he had been nothing on earth , nothing more than a humble Senegalese tirailleur . Beside the cot stood his wife , black and heavy breasted , and his two weeping little children . Father Pothi  --  vres had laid a wooden crucifix on the martyr 's chest and I noticed that Vialez looked long at the image of the Saviour of men .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
