The Verein Einsamer Kriegerfrauen ( League of Lonely War Women ) wishes to remind German soldiers that there is still one commodity at home not on the ration list . Circulars disseminated by this forthright organization , picked up by Allied troops in captured German positions , read as follows : " Dear Front Soldier : When will you come back on leave ? . . .

Display it visibly on your glass in every tea room , in every bar ... in the vicinity of a railway station . Soon a member of our League . . . will take charge of you and ... the longings of lonely nights will find fulfillment . . . . <P> " Naturally we are not unselfish . . . we long to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be shy . Your wife , your sister , or your sweetheart is also one of us . <P> " We think of you , but also of our country 's future . He who rests , rusts. "
