Last fall Henry Morgenthau got enough whacks from the banking community to fracture a softer skull . Over the dead-body opposition of almost all U.S. bankers , the Treasury Secretary insisted on shoving through a $4 billion bond issue of 1% notes of 1946 and 2% bonds of 1952 . The issue barely squeaked through for a total of $4,100,000,000 , whereas most issues theretofore had been oversubscribed 50% or more . Even to achieve this the Federal Reserve begged the banks to increase their subscriptions , offered to take over all the banks did n't want . ( Subsequently they did take over a half-billion dollars ' worth . ) <P> Bankers criticized Mr. Morgenthau furiously for his " fetish of 2% , " arguing that the offering would have been a success if it had consisted of 2% bonds of 12 to 14 years maturity . But Mr. Morgenthau , breathing heavily , stuck to his old cheap-money theory , fighting the war boom as he had fought the depression . His program " to finance this war in the seven-to-ten-year range at 2% " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labeled as " eyewash " ) : " to save this and future generations many millions of dollars on the public debt . " <P> Treasury Wins . Last week Mr. Morgenthau got the last laugh . The Treasury hung up an alltime record : applications for $19 billions worth of Treasury 1% notes ( due in 50 months ) had come in for the $2 billions worth the Treasury was offering . No oversubscription for any major Government issue had ever been so great . <P> Reasons for the cataract of oversubscriptions were varied , some good , some dubious : 1 ) banks and investors had become at least temporarily reconciled to the present interest rate ; 2 ) Government borrowings have fantastically increased the banks ' capacity to lend ; 3 ) in order to get the amount of notes they actually wanted , banks and investors subscribed for more than they expected to get , thus inflating the size of the oversubscription . <P> Speculators Win . In the wake of the frenzied demand , the " free riders " had a field day . Because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks and safety deposit boxes of individual investors , it had stipulated that subscriptions up to $100,000 would be allotted first . Speculators hastened to put their names down for such sums , confident they could sell the notes as soon as they got them to people and institutions really intending to hold them . Because it was necessary to put up only 2% of the subscription at the time of making the commitment , many a " free rider " made $500 by laying out $2,000 for three or four days ( the notes sold as high as 100 and 17/32nds almost as soon as they were issued ) .
