Drapes of eggshell rayon silk , fully a verst of it , hung from the ceiling to the floor . Behind the table stood a large portrait of Stalin , edged in red . There was no soft music , no suave couturiers . The mannequins ( rather plump ) sported no fancy make-up or nifty hairdos . Commissars , scholars , artists faced the circular platform . Paulina Semionovna Zhemchuzhina ( Madame Molotov ) , head of the Soviet Cosmetics Trust , was there , chatting brightly with Textiles Vice Commissar Dora Moissevna Khazan . In Moscow 's House of Fashions , tailors and dressmakers of the state were displaying what the well-dressed tovarish should wear in 1946 . <P> Soviet styles had always leaned to the practical rather than the pretty . But now Premier Stalin himself wanted Russians to look as smart as Westerners . The Red Army men who had seen the slinky silks and fancy figures abroad approved warmly . <P> The models stalked back &; forth Though many of the 274 designs still stressed utility , a distinct shift to the sophistication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfit might have come straight off the floor of a Paris salon-a form-fitting dinner gown in cool grey with an austere neckline and sweeping sleeves caught in narrow cuffs . <P> In honor of the Red Army , coats and suits struck a martial note with padded shoulders and belted backs , but ( and this was new ) dressy hats helped soften the severity of line . Skirts were slim , with kickpleats back and front . <P> Male styles stayed dourly conservative . In 1946 , as in 1945 and before that , men will wear sack coats without vests , topped by cloth caps in unrelieved dark shades . Hats , when worn , will be high-crowned , narrow-brimmed . <P> The experts made their choices . In due course the favored designs will be produced for the millions by the Commissariat of Light Industry . <P> From the ruins of bombed Berlin la haute couture was peeping boldly too . In draughty salons along what was once the elegant Kurfrstendamm , bright-eyed mannequins modeled the first designs after the defeat . They were almost as frothy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handicap , but gold lame , for instance , could be made to do for both cocktail gowns and housecoats ( see cut ) . For Berlin 's new army of cyclists there was a snappy yellow- &-black; suit with a matching belt in canary suede .
