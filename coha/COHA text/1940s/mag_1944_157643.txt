For the first time , a Negro newsman was admitted last week to the President 's regular press conference , granted credentials . He was light-skinned Harry McAlpin of the Atlanta Daily World ( circ. 23,000 ) and the Negro Newspaper Publishers ' Association . Previously , President Roosevelt had received 13 Negro newspaper publishers , heard their plea for an end to " second-class citizenship " and their 21-point statement of war and postwar aspirations . <P> Reporter McAlpin went into the conference without having been accepted by the Congressional Galleries ' standing committee or by the White House Correspondents ' Association , which ordinarily pass upon an applicant before credentials are issued . No Negro has ever received their approval . <P> Virginia-born Presidential Secretary Stephen T. Early took responsibility for McAlpin 's admission , said his status as correspondent had satisfied White House requirements . At week 's end the bypassed Galleries ' committee and the Correspondents ' Association had said nothing , done nothing .                    @
