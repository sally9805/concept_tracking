For the last four weeks , two students from Maine 's Bates College , both veterans , have been touring Britain , debating with British undergraduates . The Bates boys have won only twice , and lost five decisions . Defending capitalism 's ways , they lost the audience 's vote . <P> Last week at Nottingham 's University College , the two Americans argued that government should not step in to provide full employment . One Nottingham debater clinched victory by tartly observing : " The question is not in most advanced countries considered a debatable point . " Said ex-Lieut . Norman Temple , back near his wartime bomber base : " We just could n't sell free enterprise to Britain . " <P> High spot of their tour was at Cambridge , where Bates found itself on the popular side , arguing that advertising is a disgrace to modern civilization . They won hands down by singing , in duet , Pepsi-Cola Hits the Spot. * <P> *Which Englishmen could recognize as a corruption of John Peel .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
