txt Conflict Over Operational Research special to Tux LONDON , Sept. ** the liveliest meeting held at Dundee , Scotland , by any of the thirteen sections of the British Association for the Advancement of Science was the one in which Drs . J. D. Bernal , F. A. E. Crew , Louis Moss , 0 . H. Wansbrough-Jones , W. C. Wilson and S. Zuckerman discussed operational research and advocated its adoption in extricating ' Great Britain from its economic crisis . Operational research is a term coined by Sir Robert Watson-Watt , the physicist who invented the radar method of detecting hostile planes . It analyzes jobs , equipment , people , attitudes , working conditions ? and materials . It measures and correlates . It is icily objective . It cares not where its inquiries may lead and embraces not only the obvious , but trifles that are usually ignored . Out of all this emerges a clear picture of a problem . Operational researcn grew out of the war . A start was made with antiaircraft fire and radar , largely guided by Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem included even zoologists , for operational research draws on all sciences . On principle each has something to contribute , and integration of knowledge is bound to yield important results . Wartime Research Thus radar was properly linked with fire-control . Guns were located in positions military men deemed unpropitious , but which were demonstrated to be right . The result was so satisfactory that operational research thereafter was applied to tanks , infantry weapons , submarine warfare , bombing and every phase of war on land and sea .

It is even charged that operational research is communistic in origin . Its defenders ridicule these attacks . F Robert Watson-Watt says , " We believe in freedom , but it must be an informed and responsible freedom . We want no isolationism .

In fact , it is held that unless operational research is invoked by high Government quarters , unless it permeates every Government department , factory and farm in the next six months , Great Britain will collapse economically . Prof. J D. Bernal cited the coal problem as an example . In his opinion , no startling improvement in coal production can be expected , even if methods are introduced that are more efficient . But a 100 per cent improvement ( and nothing less satisfied operational researchers in war ) can be effected in the way coal i8 utilized , he said . Professor Bernal excoriated English open fireplaces and inefficient domestic stoves . He declared that operational research of the short-term variety could modify the traditional fireplace already installed to get more heat out of less coal and to indicate the type of insulation needed to keep - heat in houses . In this way millions of tons of coal now wasted could be made available for industry .
