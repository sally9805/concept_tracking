When the 1942 Revenue Act finally ground to passage , it contained under Title VIII , Section 801 , this sentence : " The term ' excessive profits ' means any amount of a contract or subcontract price which is found as a result of renegotiation to represent excessive profits . " <P> Thus in a masterpiece of ambiguity did Congress recognize one all-important fact : what U.S. business can make on its war contracts ( now some 3,000,000 in number ) is coming to depend more &; more on the decisions of Government price adjustment boards . <P> The Army , the Navy , the Maritime Commission and the Treasury now all have such boards . Their power is immense . And the game that must be played with them is complicated and important . <P> Opening Moves . The game starts in Washington . The top agencies divide the contractors . The winning board then pores over its contracts , warns companies their contracts are up for renegotiation . The companies ' first move : bookkeepers tally up the latest figures , cost accountants wrangle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-to-pin-down items like depreciation , obsolescence , reserves for post-war conversion . Sometimes gimlet-eyed price-board agents hang around to try to make sure no penny is mislaid . This statistical roundup takes days , perhaps months , sometimes actually interferes with war production . <P> Play of the Cards . With chin up , bulging brief case and a staff of lawyers and experts , the manufacturer then traipses to a regional price-board office , starts trying to take the tricks which may decide whether he makes or loses money for the duration . The board scans the books and the company 's records , checks &; double-checks for the six major factors : 1 ) production quality , 2 ) delivery rate , 3 ) inventive contribution , 4 ) cooperation with other manufacturers , 5 ) economy in the use of raw materials , 6 ) efficiency . <P> After the cards on the table have been examined , the board starts with a proposal to slash profits 25% , 50% , or maybe more . The manufacturer counter-proposes . If all the high cards belong to one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks for a hearing before the top Washington board . Since Washington is the last chance , most contractors go armed with an arsenal of facts , ready for a last-ditch fight . They usually get it . One small steel company spent two twelve-hour days arguing with the top board , got only an invitation for a return visit . <P> Sample Games . When it is all over , dollars- &-cents; results are as jealously guarded as prize patents . But six medium-sized companies wound up with an average net of 12% on sales before taxes . After 40 to 80% income taxes their profits run from 4 to 7% . <P> The Odds . The game is immensely profitable to the Government . Through the end of June ( latest available figures ) , the Army had saved $556,998,000 , the Navy $348,786,000 , the Maritime Commission $28,500,000-mostly voluntary kickbacks in anticipation of renegotiation . Before Christmas these three boards expect to save another $1,065,000,000 . Even that is just a starter . The Automotive Council for War Production , whose members hold about one-sixth of all U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much through mass production that they will voluntarily return to the Government no less than $3,000,000,000.
