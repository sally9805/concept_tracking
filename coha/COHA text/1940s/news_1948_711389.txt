txt President Truman accepted the Democratic Presidential nomination in a fighting mood this morning , predicted victory in November and announced that he would call Congress back into session on July 26 to deal with housing , education , civil rights and other controversial measures . The President was in turn scornful and bitter about the Republicans . They had made a lot of proud statements in their campaign platform , he said , anti now he would give them a chance to prove that they meant what they said . The Congress would have every chance later this month to deal with most of the questions that needed to be settled . These questions could be debated in a hurry , in fifteen days , he said , if the Republicans really meant what they were saying . But the real test the people would make , he emphasized , would be action not words . The immediate reaction at Convention Hall was that the President 's summons to Congress would create even more bitterness than now exists between the Republican-controlled branch and the Democratic executive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never precisely in a deliberative mood , and with an election campaign going on simultaneously the temperature is not likely to be reduced . Housing and high prices , Mr. Truman said , would be the main items before the new session of the Congress . " My duty as President requires . " Mr. Truman said , " that I use every means within my power to get the laws the people need on such important matters , and I am therefore calling this Congress back into session on the 26th of July . " That is on the 26th day of July , which out in Missouri we call Turnip Day . " I am going to call that Congress back , and I am going to ask them to pass laws halting rising prices and to lower the housing prices , which they say that they are for in their platform . " At the same time I shall ask them to act upon other vitally needed measures , such as aid to education , which they say that they are for ; a national health program ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ; and increase in the minimum wage , which I doubt very much they are for ; an extension of social security coverage and increased benefits , which they say that they are for ; the projects needed in our program to provide public power and cheap electricity . " If there was any reality behind the Republican platform passed by the GOP last month , the President said , " we ought to get some action out of the short session of the Eightieth Congress . " " They ( the Republicans ) are going to try to dodge their responsibilities , " he added , " and they are going to try to drag all the red herrings they can across this campaign , but I am here to say to you that Senator Barkley and I are not going to let them get away with it . " What " that worst " Eightieth Congress does in this special session , Mr. Truman concluded , will be " the test . " The American people , he remarked , " will not decide by listening to mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide on the record and the record as it has been written . " Kicker " at Start and Finish Mr. Truman started and finished his speech with a " kicker . " He came into the hall bronzed and confident and threw out this opening shot : " Senator Barkley and I will win this election and make these Republicans like it . Do n't you forget that . " The partisan audience , weary from twelve hours in this Turkish bath , howled at this one . It sobered down a bit when he entered into the Republicans ' record in Congress earlier in the year , and roared again when he announced his plans for calling Congress back . There had been considerable talk about a return of Congress among the Presiden'ts leading advisers for some days . The plan evidentlly is to keep the campaign on domestic issues as much as possible and dramatize the conservative tendencies in the Republican Congress . This strategy , likewise , is cal- , culated to draw a distinction between Gov . Thomas E. Dewey and the Republican Congress , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while Mr. Dewey 's record on domestic questions may not be bad , the Republican congressional record is . The American people will be I most " ungrateful , " he observed , if I they pass up the Democratic party this year . But they wo n't , he predicted . They had returned this party to power four times in a row , he noted . and they 'd make it five in November . Of noise there was no lack , such is the capacity of our mechanical howlers , but the delegates were all weary , some of them were bitterly silent , and while the rest , aided by the band and the loud speakers , made the noise-meters tremble , the demonstration , held down by the chairman and the hour , scarce ' ly came up to the uproarious standard of past Democratic antics . Informal Approach Pleases /When he war in an informal , extemporaneous , accusative mood , in the first minute or so of his talk , the President had the audience with him . When , however , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Republican party , the roars died down considerably . Mr. Truman early took notice of the differences within the party but this did not dampen his enthusiasm . " This convention , " he said , " met to express the will and reaffirm the beliefs of the Democratic party , There have been differences of opinion , and that is the democratic way . Those differences have been settled by a majority vote as they should be , and it is time for us to get together and beat the common enemy , and that is up to you . " Truman Waits Outside Hall For more than two hours while the convention went - through the dull business of seconding speeches , President Truman sat on a ramp outside the stage entrance to the hall and watched the trains go by . Secret Service agents had sequestered him , in a remote office within the big building but the Chief Executive preferred the open spaces and the much lower temperature outside . Senator Alben W. Barkley , whom he finally designated as his running mate in the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs brought from the guest platform . Homer L. Cummings , Atteorney General under President Roosevelt , occupied the other chair . Members of the President 's official family who were on hand to witness his arrival at the hall stood at a distance . Smartly attired in white linens with two-tone black and white summer shoes , Mr. Truman appeared entirely relaxed as he chatted with the Senator and Mr.1 Cummings . There was a flurry of excitement when , in the distance , someone set off some fireworks that sounded like three quick pistol shots . President Truman appeared not to notice the disturbance and the smbIl regiment of police and Secret Service operatives quickly resumed their stations after a cursory investigation . As the balloting began on the Presidential nomination , the President went back to a room just off the entrance leading to the speaker 's platform . White House newsmen were directed back into the hall and the Chief Executive was next seen approaching the battery of microphones while the delegates and alternates cheered him to the rafters .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
