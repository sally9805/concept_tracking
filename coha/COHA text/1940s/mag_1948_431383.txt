VICKSBURG , Miss. ? The Colonel will drive around the make-believe Mississippi Basin ? from Chicago to Pittsburgh to New Orleans , and back via the Texas panhandle , Montana , and Minnesota ? in seven or eight minutes . As the Colonel reckons time , however , this 30-m.p.h. trip will have taken about 24 hours . " Better send a man with a broom and dustpan over to clean those leaves out of the Missouri River near Omaha , " he may suggest when he returns to the control house . " Yes , sir , I 'll have it done before March 5 , " the engineer may reply . " This is February 27 , 1945 . How about having lunch now ? We can be back in plenty of time to see what the Ohio River does on March 10 . " Such Alice-in-Wonderlandish remarks will be commonplace at Clinton , Miss. , in the 1950s . Men- will speak of minutes as though they were days , of feet as though they were miles , and of ripples in a test tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the officers and engineers at Clinton actually will have North America 's greatest river system in a concrete test tube . It will be 1,500 yards long , 1,300 yards wide ? a working model of the Mississippi and all of its important tributaries . This model will cover 220 acres . It will  | depict 41 percent of the United States ? 1,200,000 square miles , including 15,700 miles of rivers . The brooks that babble across the model 's surface will be eight miles long . They will do what just comes naturally to big rivers , and thus help the engineers manage the real streams . This hydraulic relief map is being built now . It is no plaything . It will be as big a model as a practical person can imagine ? much the biggest thing of its kind in the world . To appreciate its immensity , I had to fly over it . Observation towers for visitors may be built when it is finished , but the hundreds of men now employed on the site are not preparing a mere exhibition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make him behave better . Authorities on potamology ( the science of rivers ) believe that floods actually will be warded off by this project of the U. S. Army 's Corps of Engineers and the Waterways Experiment Station of the Mississippi River Commission . The model will cost nearly $6,000,000 , but it may turn out to be a bargain . For it will *save money in two distinct ways : On this imitation of the restless Mississippi and its 40 satellites , the great floods of 1912 , 1927 , 1937 , 1945 , and 1947 or any other year can be re-enacted . Conditions that may arise in the future also can be simulated . Thus , the model will settle arguments that have raged since the French started building levees at New Orleans in  | 1717 about where more levees , dams , reservoirs , etc. , are most needed and the types of structures that will be most useful . That can save Uncle Sam billions . But Midwest 's rich , green , flat valleys . now are threatened by man-made as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pour into the Mississippi . More are being built . Still more are contemplated . The danger of floods is increased every time another , such structure is built ? unless it is propefly operated . This model will show the operators of these dams and reservoirs how to operate them so as to protect their own neighborhoods without creating floods elsewhere . Suppose , for example , that the men in charge of the 4,100,000-acre-foot " reservoir in Kentucky , the 3,350,000-acre-foot reser- voir in Montana , and several others in between were to release water independently . The result might be a catastrophic flood at Memphis . Suppose , however , that the reservoir operators first wired the scientists in Mississippi . " Reproduce present conditions on the rivers , " the director could tell the engineer in charge of the model , " then add water at rates and times corresponding to those at which these reservoir operators say they 'll be discharging it . " " Gosh , boss , this looks bad , " the engineer might report eight hours later , and lay a sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , " the director might agree . " But do n't worry . I 'll phone Hank Johnson up at Fort Peck . He and some of the others can change their schedules enough so that nobody will get wet at Memphis , or anywhere else . " Billion-Dollar Menace How many lives , and how much property , can be saved by such fast , sure teamwork ? There 's no telling , but recent history is en-lightening : Last summer 's floods in the Midwest took 16 lives and caused damage estimated at $1,000,000,000 . Very little of that damage was covered by insurance , because the people who live along many of these rivers can not buy flood insurance the way they buy fire insurance . This estimate , moreover , takes no account of the misery of 48,000 persons whose homes and shops were left caked with stinking mud , or the sums spent by the Red Cross and other relief agencies . Manmade floods could be equally costly . This model , in short also to save farmers , merchants , and manufacturers from flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will it work ? The engineers at the largest hydraulics laboratory in the world , the experiment station in Vicksburg , are sure that it will . They have built dozens of models of rivers and harbors . They have been solving difficult problems with these models for 18 years . They even have a thoroughly tested , 21i-acre model of the lower part of the Mississippi , built on the same scale as the big one now under construction . And it works fine . Horizontally , one foot on the big model will represent 2,000 feet of the earth 's surface . Vertically , however , one foot on the model will represent only 100 feet , because if the vertical scale were the same as the horizontal scale , the rivers would be too shallow and the currents too weak to be measurable . Actually , the currents in the model rivers will be from one-seventh to one-eighth as swift as those you 'd have to buck if you were in a rowboat on the real streams , and 1,000 gallons per minute will suffice to portray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The site for the big model , several miles from the Vicksburg laboratory , was chosen  | because of its natural approximation to the desired dimensions . Even so , 1,000,000 cubic yards of earth had to be moved . The knolls that represent the Appalachian slope rise 20 feet now , and those representing the Rockies rise 50 feet above the model 's " sea level . " The river beds and valleys will be long , zigzagging strips of concrete , varying in width from a few feet to several yards . These are being built now . The rolling land between these winding waterways will be sodded . Signs will mark the sites of cities , and eventually there will be roads around and through the model . Like a modern city 's utility lines , however , the things that make the model tick will be concealed underground . There will be 15 miles of storm sewers , big water mains , and a maze of wires for electrical instruments below the surface . Water for the midget rivers will come from and return to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere near the site of Mobile , Ala. , on the model . It will be nice , clean water because the kinds of research that the engineers have in mind can be done without mud . The pumps and instruments all will be operated from a control house " north of Chicago . " The pumps will be capable of delivering 10 times as much water as will be needed to simulate a Mississippi flood . This abundant supply will enable the engineers to operate various parts of the model separately , and study several problems at once . Like designers of complex industrial plants , the architects of this colossal and intricate device built a " pilot " model first . But these planners bumped into a problem that seldom bothers industrial engineers ? the curvature of the earth . To allow for this , Karl A. Dupes devised a method of combining a French mapping system ( the Bonne projection ) and a rectangular grid system ? and thereby won himself a merit award from the Secretary of War . Robots Will Run It The gauges along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments . One of the several types now being considered will have a tiny motor suspended from an arm over the water . This motor will spin a set of pins , the points of which will barely touch the water at all times . The arm to which this pin wheel is attached will rise as the crest of a flood approaches and descend when it passes . Although a rise of a tenth of a foot in these creeks will correspond to a 10-foot rise in a genuine river , this instrument will yield as accurate data as can be obtained from human observers on the big streams . There will be from 600 to 800 such gauges . These and other devices will do just about everything except shout " Mark Twain . " They will make it astonishingly easy to conduct experiments . The switchboard in the control house will look like the switchboard of a power plant , and the operator will be able to twiddle his thumbs most of the time  | because the whole river system will be managed for him by robots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a foot in diameter on its face . A paper record will be placed on this dial . A tiny arm then will follow whatever curve is drawn on the record and send appropriate signals to automatic valves at from 200 to 300 inflow points . Some of these faucets will have fixed orifices of various sizes ; others will have single openings that widen or diminish like camera shutters . Another programmer will control the amount of water flowing out of the model , at from 60 to 70 points , when the operator wants this measured . Some of these outlets will handle only 10 gallons a minute ; others will dispose of up to 800 gallons a minute . To change from a simulation of conditions that prevailed in 1947 to those that existed in 1917 , the operator will simply change the records on the programmers . It will be no more difficult than putting records on phonographs . A row of lights will show how the pumps are working and the operator will have a communication system by which he can bark orders to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the proceedings . The results of experiments run on the model will be jotted down , automatically , by a great battery of square-faced instruments . These instruments will produce a continuous record of the tiny rivers ' stages at points corresponding to those at which comparable figures are kept throughout the Midwest . There is no other known way , in many cases , of obtaining such data about floods before they occur . Models of this type are used only to solve problems so complex that they stump the experts ' slide rules . And this model will differ from its predecessors in only two ways : it will be bigger , and the instrumentation will be much better . Construction of this giant was started during the war by Maj. Gen. Eugene Reybold . Three thousand prisoners of war from Germany ( where the hydraulic-model technique had originated ) were employed on it . Among them were civil engineers , surveyors , and craftsmen of all kinds . They did about a third of the work . Civilians are continuing the job now under the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Station . Completing the colossal model will take at least three more years .  |
