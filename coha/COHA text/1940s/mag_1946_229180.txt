Chiang Kai-shek won his greatest ' victory in years over the Communists last week : General Fu Tso-yi 's army marched into scorched and abandoned Kalgan , the Reds ' Great Wall " show place . " Because Kalgan 's fall convinced many that Chiang could take Harbin or any other large Chinese city ( as long as he had U.S. help ) , the victory held a happy political significance for Chinese Nationalists who believe with Chiang that the Communists can be beaten into agreement . <P> However , U.S. General George C. Marshall and Ambassador Leighton Stuart have been impressed by the Communist threat that if Chiang took Kalgan the Reds would begin all-out civil war in a " total national split . " For those who started from that premise , the fall of Kalgan held an unhappy political significance . <P> In spite of his conviction that China " could be effectively unified by military victory , the Gissimo had , just before Kalgan 's fall , acquiesced to Marshall 's proposal for a ten-day truce that would have javed the Red city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalgan go , though its loss drove a wedge between Communist Yenan and the Reds ' Manchurian rampart . Kalgan 's capture was the climax and the symbol of six months of campaigning in which the Government army had been more successful than impartial observers had expected . In addition to several Red cities ( notably Chengteh ana Changchun ) they had cleared many miles of economically vital North China railroads . <P> But in Yenan , defiant Communist Leader Mao Tse-tung called for unlimited guerrilla warfare from hundreds of Red village bases . In Manchuria , Communist Li Lisan , who had opposed Mao in internal Communist politics 20 years ago ( TIME , Sept. 9 ; Sept. 23 ) , was urging a separate , Soviet-backed state . <P> Within the next month the Communists would have to make up their minds between 1 ) guerrilla war , 2 ) a separate state inaccessible to Chiang 's armies or 3 ) peace on terms in which a Chinese Government can function without a Communist veto ( see below ) .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
