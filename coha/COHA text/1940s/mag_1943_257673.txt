Once again this week the professional farm leaders descended on Washington to fight for higher prices . <P> Quick and efficient from long practice , they set about laying their battle lines . They rounded up friends and satellites , isolated foes , started political pressures back home , conferred on strategy . <P> This was an old pattern : last September the farm bloc came perilously close to forcing through Congress an inflationary bill that would have handed a few top-drawer farmers billions of dollars at the consumers ' expense . <P> But this time the Farm Bureau 's Edward Asbury O'Neal III , the National Grange 's Albert S. Goss and the representatives of smaller farm pressure groups were smugly confident they could put through a broad-beam farm program of their own . In the new Congress they counted on a bigger , friendlier farm bloc . They knew the country , desperately in need of more food , was hardly disposed to much argument about ways of getting it . And their onetime friend and present opponent , the Agriculture Department , was scared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlines ready . <P> First is an all-out attempt to boost farm prices by changing the bases for calculating the farm parity ( although farm income now is 15% above parity ) , busting loose OPA and its price ceilings . <P> Second is an attack on New Deal farm agencies , particularly Farm Security Administration , which by loans and counsel has been helping hundreds of thousands of small ( i.e. , non-Farm Bureau ) farmers to double their war-needed food production . These agencies the lobbyists hold to be social experiments and luxuries in wartime . <P> Third is getting recognition for agriculture as a wartime industry-in terms of more rubber , more money , gasoline , manpower , transportation . <P> For winning their battle , the farm leaders have tested devices : direct farm bills , amendments attached to administration measures , restrictive riders to appropriation bills . Exclaimed Ed O'Neal : " By God , if this is a war industry , you 've got to give us a price . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
