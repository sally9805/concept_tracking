At a publisher 's Christmas party in Manhattan , the Devil , who is everywhere , found himself cornered by a critic from a Little Magazine . The critic thought that the Devil looked too forceful for an intellectual , too thoughtful for a book publisher , and decided at first that he must be somebody high up in cinema . So he began to tell him about the esoteric first novel he hoped to sell to Hollywood . <P> The Devil broke in rudely : " Have you read The Gauntlet ? " * <P> " Certainly not , " said the critic . " Have you ? " <P> " Certainly , " said the Devil . " In my line we try to keep up with all the latest religious fiction . Rather a bore these days . But The Gauntlet has something special . " <P> " What ? " asked the critic . <P> " For one thing , a two-month sale of some 800,000 copies , " said the Devil . " Why , more than a million people must have read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the critic . <P> " Instinctively , I might even say professionally , I am democratic , " said the Devil . " When I see that many people reading a book , I want to know what they are reading about besides a hero named the Reverend London Wingo . " <P> The critic groaned . " Now The Gauntlet " said the Devil , warming up , " is about Baptists . Who but me , with my intense interest in religion , would ever read about Baptists except in a novel ? This one takes you right into a Baptist seminary , shows you the callowness , the shallowness , the dingy personal problems of the young men who will become fishers of souls . It takes you into a small Baptist church in a small Missouri town , shows you the political shenanigans , the scandalous gossip , the social going-over every minister and his wife have to take . Even I learned something from it . " <P> " You pronounce the word Baptist like an Anglo-Catholic . " said the critic . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no religious prejudices . When The Gauntlet opens , this Wingo is studying at the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary . He has married ' a tiny , merry raindrop of a girl ' who has bobbed hair ( it is 1923 ) and insists on being called Kathie instead of Katherine . She is also pregnant , and the Reverend Wingo is wondering where he is going to get the money for the delivery . So he goes to his friend , the Reverend Page Musselwhite , and tells him : ' I want to find Truth . It seems to me that at times my mind , my reason , is challenging my spirit , throwing down a gauntlet and daring my spirit to pick it up ! ' " <P> " I suppose , " said the critic wearily , snatching a highball from a passing waiter , " that is why the novel is called The Gauntlet . "
