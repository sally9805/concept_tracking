The lights of Butte , Mont. , when seen from the Continental Divide , have a strange , haunting beauty . But in the daytime Butte is anything but beautiful to look at- " by dark a diamond set in jet , but by day ... an uncorseted wench dissipated from the night before . " Last week Butte ( pop . 37,000 ) had a book all to itself . The book ( Copper Camp ; Hastings House ; $2.75 ) is the latest of the series compiled by the late Federal Writers ' Project of WPA . <P> Few memories in Butte are long enough to go back to the hot day in July 1864 when G.O . Humphrey and William Allison struck gold on Butte Hill a few years before the hill 's true wealth-copper - was discovered . But more than one Butte citizen could recall the icy December day in 1881 when an old-fashioned locomotive huffed &; puffed up the newly completed Utah &; Northern narrow-gauge railroad to connect Butte with Ogden , Utah ( and the outside world ) by rail . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedlock to the price of copper , its pioneer past forever coloring its psychology , its rough- &-tumble; legend becoming part of the legend of the U.S. Some of Butte 's legend : <P> &gt;Saloons with such names as the Alley Cat , Collar and Elbow , Pick and Shovel , Graveyard , Pay Day . &gt;Waitresses with such names as Skip Chute , Mag the Rag , Hay ride , The Race Horse , Take-Five Annie , Ellen the Elephant , Little Egypt . <P> &gt;Sporting " girls of the line " who made Galena Street one of the most notorious wide-open districts in the U.S. , ranking with San Francisco 's Barbary Coast . Wrote one observer : " I 've often seen it on the old line with the girls late in the evening walking up the street , their stockings so weighted down with silver dollars that it was all they could do to navigate . " Added another : " There were some sprightly-lookin ' lasses down there . . . . But there was plenty of tough-lookin ' blisters too . A man could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> &gt;Butte 's oldtime motto , " Spend it while you 've got it and do n't cry when it 's gone , " and the hell-roaring characters who lived up to the motto . Among them : Larry Mullins , a mine shoveler , who inherited $3,500 and spent it by installing a public harem in a hotel suite where he played host for a riotous three days . <P> &gt;Callahan the Bum , who whiled away most of a summer afternoon trying to hang himself on one of the main streets and gave up in disgust because nobody would notice him . <P> &gt; " The Centerville Bull , " a coal-black animal with uncontrollable mating instincts , which roamed the streets " causing consternation as he smashed down fences and led cows away from their paths of rectitude . ... A Mrs. Sullivan , tiring of the depredations , decided to take matters into her own hands . She scored a bull's-eye , hitting the bull in a spot that measurably reduced his virility . " <P> &gt; Dynamite , Butte 's own dog , whose tax was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food at restaurants , became so spoiled it would eat only T-bone steaks and turkey and chicken scraps .
