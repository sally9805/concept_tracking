Missouri last week held a Senatorial primary as sizzling as the weather , as stubborn as a Missouri mule , as mixed-up as a mule 's parentage . Senator Bennett Champ Clark stuck his reddish nose into it by stumping for Senator Harry S. Truman , elected six years ago by Kansas City 's Boss Pendergast . It was evident that Bennett Clark did not enjoy backing Truman so much as he loved clapperclawing Truman 's rival-stiff , Roman-nosed Governor Lloyd Crow Stark . Also to the aid of New Dealer Truman went New Deal Wheelhorse Alben Barkley . At a St. Louis campaign rally attended by 300 party hacks and laborites , he conferred the Roosevelt blessing on Candidate Truman . But Alben Barkley was not happy to find himself in the same camp with Champ Clark . They are bitter enemies , for Clark , a shrewd parliamentarian , has consistently made the clumsy majority leader look ridiculous by outmaneuvering him in the Senate . <P> Meantime Governor Stark kept his end up . He denounced Truman for his link with Boss Pendergast ; for playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District Attorney Maurice Milligan , who last year sent Boss Pendergast to prison . Lincolnesque Mr. Milligan , in turn , blazed away at Truman , charged him with having won his Senate seat in 1934 with the help of 60,000 fraudulent votes dug up by Pendergast ; at Stark for sticking with Pendergast until Milligan sent the boss to jail . <P> When the yelling had quieted down , Truman had beaten Stark by 8,000 votes , with Milligan a poor third , and Missouri voters found to their dismay that , in a year when Louisiana had kicked out the remnants of the Huey Long machine , they had voted to restore Pendergastery . Old Tom Pendergast was out of Leavenworth on probation , and under the lee of Mayor Bernard Dickmann 's St. Louis machine the Pendergasters in Kansas City could now mend their battered breeches . No one believed that Republican Candidate Manuel A. Davis would be strong enough to beat Truman in November . If Missourians cared , they had only themselves to blame . In St. Louis alone 169,000 registered voters had failed to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
