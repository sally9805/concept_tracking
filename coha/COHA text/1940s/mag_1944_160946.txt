Ch'en Li-fu , China 's frail and handsome Minister of Education , won a great victory last October . He succeeded in extending his dictatorship over China 's thinkers as far as the U.S. In a new set of rules his Ministry declared that a bureau to " guide and control thought and conduct " of private Chinese students studying abroad would be set up in each foreign country . To these thought controllers the students would have to give unconditional obedience and " the moment facts are substantiated and reported to the Ministry that their speech or writing is contrary to the teachings of the Three People 's Principles* . . . they will be sent back to China . " In February similar regulations were drafted for professors and instructors going abroad . <P> All might have gone well had not the regulations a fortnight ago come to the attention of Harvard Philosopher Ralph Barton Perry . As leader of Harvard 's American Defense Faculty Group , Perry asked the State Department to investigate and , if it found the regulations as sinister as they appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrupulously avoided mentioning the similarity , shocking to all American educators , between these rules and the Japanese system of thought control . <P> How to Eat Soup . Last week at Chung-king 's foreign press conference , the Chinese Government , stung by the Perry incident and a scorching New York Times editorial , made reply . Spokesman was the ablest of China 's three governmental mouthpieces-young Dr. P. H. Chang , who speaks for the cabinet . Dr. Chang blithely kissed off the controversy as a misunderstanding . A poor translation had made the regulations read as if the supervisors were " to guide and control thought and conduct " ; actually the correct translation was " to guide the thoughts and control the actions of students abroad . " As for the training a student had to receive before going abroad-that was simply to teach him " how to eat soup , not to put his knife in his mouth , or to put salt in his coffee . " <P> Less comforting , however , was the formal statement issued by Ch'en Li-fu to the press : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Principles shall be the basic educational principles of the Republic of China ; just as democracy is the basic principle of America 's education and should not be contravened . Any Chinese who violates the Three People 's Principles violates common interests in the war of defense , students being no exception . " <P> These were interesting words . No one knew what they meant in practice , but in Chungking and the U.S. alike observers were prepared to apply to Ch'en Li-fu the maxim of his great mentor , Confucius : " Listen to men 's words , but watch what they do . " <P> These Principles Principles-nationalism , democracy and livelihood-were laid down by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in 1924 as the theoretical basis for reconstruction of China . They are the cardinal articles of faith of the Nationalist Party .
