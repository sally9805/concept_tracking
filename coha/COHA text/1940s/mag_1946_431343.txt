NEVADA has meant many things to many people . To that surging " golden army , " the Forty-niners , who trekked their hard , hot way across the continent to California , Nevada was only an accursed highroad in the desert wilderness ? a grueling trail of swirling alkali dust , high mountain barriers , blistering heat , and choking thirst . Hollow-cheeked men , their eyes reddened with alkali , grumbled that the water ? if indeed there was water at all ? was like none they had ever tasted before . It was stinking and bitter and hot and would kill their oxen if lack of pasturage did n't . The sagebrush plains and salt-encrusted sinks soon became littered with broken wagons , abandoned cookstoves , walnut dressers , tools , and skeletons of fallen beasts . Prowling Indians added to the travail and death . To the Mormons here was a short-lived outpost to Zion , a portion of Utah Territory , where tough , daring pioneers could dig irrigation ditches in the greening valleys and grow precious turnips and a few other vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Area of the West To Jedediah Strong Smith , fur trapper Peter Skene Ogden , John Charles Fremont , and other trail blazers who had gone before , here was the great unknown land , a wide mystery area of the West , that they must probe . Did the mythical Buenaventura River of the Spanish or some other waterway flow through the land to link the heart of the continent with the sea ? Fremont found that none did . Rivers born in the snow-whitened hills died in inland lakes or on vast salt flats . To the region he appended the name " Great Basin . " " I believe that God never made anything without a purpose , " ejaculated Horace Greeley after he had jounced across the Overland Trail in 1859 . " But the wilderness I have just crossed is certainly worthless for agriculture . Unless there shall prove to be great mineral wealth there , it has been created in vain . " Nevada was n't created in vain , as events in that year were to prove ! A small group of placer miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been gaining slender winnings in the gravel beds of a ravine , grandiloquently named Gold Canyon . Among them was restless , tippling James ( Old Virginny ) Finney . One day Old Virginny prevailed upon three of his pals to climb with him to the head of the gulch to see if they could find something better . They found gold , gold enough not only to make a good living but to cause a local flurry in claim staking . As workings progressed , the miners in the vicinity accidentally uncovered some rich deposits , but they cursed the black rocks and bluish sand that kept clogging their rockers . Out of curiosity someone had that " bluish stuff " assayed . It ran $3,876 to the tonthree-fourths silver , the rest gold ! The blue sand they had been tossing down the hillside was silver sulphide . The Comstock Lode had been struck ; the " Washoe Rush " was on ! In the annals of American mining the Cornstock still stands as one of the great bonanzas of all time . Its output of silver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tons ! Headlines of Mining History Tonopah , Goldfield , Rhyolite , Tuscarora , Eureka , Austin ? these and many others are names to conjure with in Nevada 's exciting mining history . One after another new strikes  | were discovered and new camps mushroomed up all over the State . For years there was a hubbub of excitement . Some of the mines were destined to be shortlived and their camps abandoned . Others set tled down to steady production for , years . Some still are producing metal from scientific development of huge deposits . Spanish tales tell that when Pizarro and his conquistadors marched into the high Andes they imprisoned the Inca ruler and held him at ransom for a roomful of golden ornaments . If all the gold dug from these bare Nevada hills were cast into a single solid block , it would form a cube as big as a fair-sized room . It would weigh more than 672 tons ! And the silver from this Silver State would form a colossal lump the size of a mansion ! Nor is this all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead and zinc that the State has produced into cubical piles , the pile of each metal would rise on the landscape like a 10- to 15-story office building . To Abraham Lincoln , guiding the Nation through the strained years of the Civil War , Nevada 's admission to the Union was worth " another million soldiers , " since it would give the additional votes necessary to pass the 13th amendment . And so . in the midst of the conflict , on October 31 , 1864 , the Territory was given full statehood . adding the thirty-sixth star to the National Flag ( Color Plate III ) . Its constitution was wired to Washington for acceptance ? the longest telegram on record to that timeat a cost of $3,416.77 . The output and potential wealth of Nevada mines did much to bolster the credit of the Union . These mines also shared in the fulfillment of Lincoln 's prophetic statement , made at the time he signed the bill authorizing the building of western railroads : " The western mines will prove to be the treasury of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Last Frontier . " Frontier it still is , but one in which the turbulent West of its youth has been tamed and streamlined . Streamliners Supplant Covered Wagons Swift , sleek streamliners whiz across the State on shining steel rails . Passengers lounging in soft-cushioned Pullmans look out the windows onto the Humboldt River route where thirsty men of the Bidwell party prodded  | skinny ox teams to cut the first dusty wagon tracks in the sagebrush and sand wastes 105 years ago . In the blazing heat of midsummer the quivering mirages and dust whirlwinds , doing dervishlike dances over the alkali sinks , were enough to drive the early emigrants mad ? and they sometimes did . Today 's trekkers wail if an air-conditioning unit quits and their car gets warm ! Motorcars rolling along wide , asphalted Route 40 , which follows the same path , pause now for gas where the ox drivers sought grass . On windows of many autos hang air coolers to temper the heat . Splendid Route 50 has replaced the rutted road over which the Overland Trail stages once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in the West , but they are huge high-speed buses now . One stage line evokes memories of an earlier day by : ring the name " Pony Express . " Travelers stopping u Nevada towns have their choice of comfortable hotels , model auto courts , and air-conditioned " motels . " Air beacons sweep the desert skies to guide transport planes roaring overhead . Because of the long hours of sunshine and the wide unimpeded spaces in the State , both the Army and Navy established air training stations here during the war . A Modern Mining Land Indians now live peacefully on reservations and till the soil , tend cattle , and go fishing . Feathers and buckskin suits are worn only at festivals , and families hop in old jalopies when they ride to rodeos or go to shop and see the movies ( Color Plate VII ) . Nevada is still a mining land , but with little of the wild scramble of years past . During the last few years the war curtailed mining of gold and silver . Emphasis has been on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tungsten , and magnesium . Trim Nevada towns glare at night with big neon signs . One such sign , arching over Virginia Street in Reno , proclaims that the town is the " biggest little city in the world " ( Plate XVI and page 7 ) . It is big in that it has excellent shops selling  | goods as up-to-the-moment as any store in New York or Hollywood . It has modern hotels , fine homes , shady parks , and public swimming pools . Neither here nor in any other town throughout the State , however , will you find tall skyscrapers . If you would see those , you will have to look for them in San Francisco , where the wealth from Nevada 's mines contributed to their building . But here , and in smaller communities , you will find a metropolitan aspect that quite belies the size of the city , for Nevada 's towns are distribution and shopping centers for extensive districts . On a lovely tree- and lake-landscaped hill at the north end of Reno sprawls the 86-acre campus of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women  | students attend its Colleges of Arts and Science , Agriculture , and Engineering , which includes also the famous Mackay School of Mines ( page 35 ) . Linked to the University , too , are the Agricultural Experiment Station and Agricultural Extension Division and four State Public Service Departments ? the Analytical Laboratory , Food and Drugs Control and Weights and Measures , Veterinary Control , and Bureau of Mines . The United States Mines Experiment Station for rare and precious metals also shares space on the campus . University Maps State 's Future " The task before us now , " said President John O. Moseley , " is to transfer the dynamics of war to the dynamics of peace , for life here at the university is a guide to the future course of the State . " Here is the laboratory in which the research must be done to further the State 's prosperity in mining , oil , soil , water , and other natural assets , and for the stabilization of homes and social amelioration . " Among all the 48 States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size , has the fewest people . Reno , its biggest city , has about 25,000 persons ; Carson City is the smallest State capital in the Nation . Indeed , the 110,000 square miles of area would provide a square mile for each of its residents . Population statistics , however , are no measure of the stature of the State or of its citizens . To understand Nevada 's comparative emptiness , look briefly at its map spot and see why . Between the Wasatch Range in Utah and the high Sierra Nevada lies the vast region which Fremont labeled the Great Basin . It extends northward into Oregon and southward into California , but the major part of it falls within the boundaries of Nevada . Actually , the Basin is not a single giant saucer , but many . During early geological ages the earth here underwent many violent contortions of rising and falling , buckling and cracking , and spewing forth wide flows of lava . But in fairly recent geological times the Great Basin assumed more or less its present form when the earth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faults , and its broken blocks tilted up edgewise into mountainous ridges . These " basin ranges , " as geologists call them , rib all Nevada in a general north-south direction . Between them lie numerous basins ? lakes , desert sinks , and vast dried mud or alkali flats . Over most of the State the basin areas range between 4,000 and 6,000 feet in elevation , though in the south they tilt downward and finally dip below sea level in Death Valley , California . Intervening mountains rear to heights of from 5,000 to 7,000 feet above the floor of the valleys . Lakes Once Filled the Basins Once the land had an abundance of rainfall . Big lakes filled the basins . The climate then turned drier and warmer , and desiccation began . Again , geologists say , the lakes were refilled and again re-evaporated . Largest of all these prehistoric lakes within Nevada was Lake Lahontan , which at its maximum covered 8,500 square miles . Its complement , Bonneville in Utah , of which Great Salt Lake now forms a remnant , was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lying 70-odd miles apart , are cupped in the deeper hollows of ancient Lahontan . You can ride for miles across the desert now in the region . of these lakes and see the old beaches of Lahontan still etched on the sides of the mountains high above your head . Evaporation continues , for the lofty ant : still-growing Sierra Nevada forms a rain screen to the moisture-laden winds blowing from the Pacific . Pyramid and Walker Lakes are shrinking and becoming more brackish . Winnemucca Lake has dried up several times since Nevada became a State . The Humboldt , Carson , and scores of other onetime lakes have become either bone-dry salt plains or only shallow sheets of water which vary in size from season to season . Black Rock and Smoke Creek Deserts . which once formed an arm of Lahontan in the northwest portion of the State , are as desolate wastes as any spot you could pick on earth . When Swinburne penned the lines , " That even the weariest river winds somewhere safe to sea , " he knew not of Nevada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State  | flow into the lakes or sinks within its own confines . Some rise in the snowy peaks of the Sierras , notably the Truckee , Walker , and Carson . The lowly Humboldt and its tributaries start within the heart of the Great Basin and die within it . Altogether , the Humboldt meanders nearly 600 miles to get 250 miles across the State , but , as someone has quipped , " It starts nowhere and ends nowhere ! " After its weary wanderings it vanishes in the Humboldt and Carson Sinks . Not all Nevada is a desert of sagebrush and greasewood . Today , rivers have been dammed , irrigation ditches dug , and thousands of acres of land turned to cultivation . But like the Psalmist of old , Nevadans look unto the hills , whence cometh their help . Most of the water that feeds the rivers comes from the deep snows that are precipitated on the mountains in winter . An Expert on Melting Snows From Dr. James E. Church , Jr. , at the University in Reno , I learned how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecast is made of the summer water supply derived from melting snows ( page 6 ) . Though he is a professor emeritus of the classics , Dr. Church 's interests have been many , and his snow studies have brought him world fame . Years ago he tramped the high Sierras in winter to sample and weigh the snow that piled deep on the slopes . Now younger fieldmen from the Nevada Agricultural Experiment Station carry on the systematic survey . Equipped with long aluminum tubes specially designed for the work , they take samples over specific areas of Nevada 's watersheds . The tubes are driven through the full depth of the snow ? in many places 25 feet deep ? and the samples then weighed to determine the water content . From an accumulation of such data , obtained from year to year , the amount of water runoff during the summer , as compared with that of previous years , can be forecast with a high degree of accuracy . If sampling , for example , should reveal that snowfall is but three-fourths that of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acreage to conform to onefourth less water for irrigation . In a land where approximately 90 percent of the crops rely on irrigation , such information is of paramount importance . Out near Fallon , some 55 miles east of Reno , the Federal Government began the Newlands Reclamation Project ( Truckee-Carson Project ) back in 1903 , the first such irrigation task in the country under the Reclamation Act of 1902 . The Reclamation Act , which has done so much to redeem the thirsty lands in the West was framed by Francis G. Newlands , who long represented Nevada in both the House and the Senate . Popular " Pat " McCarran , now senior Senator from Nevada , serves on the important Committee for Irrigation and Reclamation . He is doing outstanding work for the development of the National Capital by his service on the District of Columbia Committee , as did Mr. Newlands before him . A Band of Fertility Water , here at Fallon , has been diverted from both the Carson and Truckee Rivers to serve 87,000 acres of land in all-year irrigation . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valley . Famous , too , are the district 's Hearts of Gold cantaloupes and the prize flocks of Fallon turkeys . Much of the length of the Truckee River is bordered by a verdant band which winds through Reno , spreads into the broad Truckee Meadows , and then narrows again into a green ribbon as the river twists through canyons on its way to Pyramid Lake . The Truckee 's source is lovely Lake Tahoe . " Lake of the Sky , " cradled high in the scenic Sierras . Tahoe is shared by both Nevada and California , but only about a third of its area lies within Nevada . While the Nevadans may regret that they do not hold more of the pine-studded mountain shores of this delightful summer resort , they are grateful that the all-important crystal water spills down through the Truckee into their thirsty land . That all interests around Tahoe may be properly served , the amount of water emptying into the river is regulated down to decimals of a foot ! With maximum water level established at 6,229.1 feet and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , possesses a 6-foot-deep reservoir spread over the top of that extensive body of water which stretches 21 miles in length and 12 miles in width . Along the Carson Valley , where the Mormons established the first permanent Nevada settlement of Genoa and planted their turnip patches , farmers and ranchmen have diverted water and created miles of rich farmlands and pastures . As we drove down through the spick-andspan town of Minden and past Gardnerville , acres of heavy alfalfa were being cut , raked , and stacked . Balers also were busy ( XV ) . Some of the trucks hauling bales from the  | fields were using bale loaders . This novel arm implement was designed as a labor saver tiring the war . It is an inclined wheeled elevator which can e attached to the side of a truck . As the truck moves across the field , the heavy bales are mechanically scooped up and borne on the sloping elevator by carrier chains to the men loading the truck . From blueprints provided by the Agriculcultural Extension Division of the University of Nevada , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they require only the rear axles of old automobiles , some gear chain , and a few pieces of metal and wood . Extensive acreage about Yerington on the Walker River , the " Big Meadows " around Lovelock , fed by the Rye Patch Reservoir on the Humboldt , the Owyhee River district , and watered valleys at the foot of the Ruby Mountains are among other sizable oases of cultivation in the State . Many smaller watered areas form vivid splashes of green against the surrounding duncolored desert . Altogether , Nevada has approximately 500,000 acres of crop land , of which about 90 persent is devoted to alfalfa and other hay crops . Nearly Half a Million Cattle The preponderance of hay in the State 's agriculture is directly linked with her large livestock industry . In early days some of the soldiers who came to man the forts against Indian attacks settled down and started raising stock . Cattle then were the rangy Texas longhorns ? more head , horns , and tail than thick , juicy steaks . Now you see the ranges alive with plump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 , - 000 cattle on its vast ranch lands . Large herds graze in the northern portion of the State where moisture is somewhat more plentiful and better grass grows . Big Elko County , particularly , is a cattlemen 's land . Roughly seven-eighths of the State is Government-owned , and much of it is administered by either the United States Forest Service or Grazing Service . Stockmen gain grazing privileges to these lands by Federal permit . Only watered valley pasture and agricultural districts are privately owned . Some herds roam the range all year round . Others graze in the high mountain pastures during the summer and then winter in the valleys and eat hay . Although cattlemen do not pamper their stock here , as in some States , they have found that it is sound economics to feed and protect it against " winterkilling . " " We have fewer big fall drives to railway loading yards now , " explained a cattleman in Elko . " It is cheaper to truck them from the ranches to the railroad than it is to have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only to the bawling of cattle and plaintive wail of lost calves but also to the bleating of more than 800,000 sheep . Herded largely by Basques , or Boscos as they are called locally , flocks browse on the high hill slopes and isolated grassy canyons during the summer months and move to warmer lowlands when snows blanket the mountains . Not so many years ago recriminations and open feuds flared persistently between cattleand sheepmen over pasturage . Rifles were used to force decisions . Both sides even poisoned waterholes where opponents ' stock drank . Under grazing control , however , old conflicts have been eliminated , and today some ranches run both sheep and cattle . An often-told tale in Nevada deals with a prospector who came upon a sheepherder high up in a remote mountain valley and fell into conversation with him . " I should think that the perpetual baabaaing of all these sheep would drive you crazy , " remarked the prospector , used to the solitude of his task . " Sometimes it does , " admitted the herder . " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , " drawled the sheepherder with a chuckle , " then I go prospecting ! " Today the traditional old grubstaked prospector with floppy-eared burro toting his bean pot , blanket , and sampling kit has almost vanished from the Nevada scene . But some are roaming the countryside in old highwheeled flivvers looking for another Comstock or Tonopah . Most Are Prospectors at Heart Most Nevadans are prospectors at heart , either amateur or professional . It 's in their blood . Few persons out in the country can resist picking up an interesting rock and examining it . " Every year we get 5,000 to 6,000 samples of minerals sent from practically every post office in the State , " said one of the assay chemists at the State Analytical Laboratory at the university in Reno . " When men go hunting deer they send in numerous samples for assay . Many persons who have regular jobs go out to prospect during holidays . Women also join rock and mineral clubs and listen to experts who give them lectures on the ores of the State .  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature to provide free assay for the citizens of Nevada who might otherwise lose valuable mineral rights from their inability to have them assayed commercially . " " Do they ever find anything worth while ? " I asked . " Oh , yes . As an example , take the persons who once brought in some brownish-white rock and thought it might be barite . It turned out to be scheelite ? tungsten ore . They later sold their claim up beyond Lovelock for several thousand dollars . " The faults , or cracks , that once split the Great Basin area are what made Nevada the mining land it is . In the passage of centuries many of these faults filled with valuable minerals ; other fractures , earth heavings , and erosion have laid some of them bare . At Steamboat Springs , a few miles south of Reno , you can see Nature 's strange processes still at work . From cracks in the earth rise sulphurous bubbling waters and clouds of steam . The waters are being commercialized as medicinal baths , and someone with imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of interest to the geologist , however , is the fact that a number of little overflow rivulets are depositing sulphides in the same manner in which some of the ore veins were formed ( page 22 ) . From such minerals in the making , Nevada 's geological revelations range back to petrified forests and to footprints left in primordial mud by clumsy mammoths , lithe deer , and strange birds . To see this land of many surprises , let us take a quick swing around the State . Pioneer Days of Virginia City Mount the hills eastward from Steamboat Springs by a new highway that has replaced the tortuous Geiger Grade and you come soon  | to Virginia City , redolent in its memories of big bonanzas , gun fights , gaudiness , and genteel living . Here was a world where poor men became millionaires and millionaires went broke in the vagaries and manipulations along the Comstock Lode . Here miners slept dozens together in " bull pens " and bars were their clubs . Here Comstock kings banqueted on iced oysters from the coast , costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold doorknobs and European fittings . Virginia City was anything and everything during the fevered years when fortunes lay in the barren hillsides . Estimates of its boom population range from 15,000 to 40,000 persons . Shafts drove downward ; whole forests from the Tahoe region of the Sierras were carried underground to brace the square-set mines . Here new techniques and new tools for mining were developed . Deep in the earth the miners hit hot water and sweltering heat . " I operated a pump down in the bottom , " one former Comstocker told me . " The heat was so bad we worked only a few minutes , jumped into a tub of ice water to cool off , and then went back to work . " An End to Booms and Slumps Water , heat , and played-out lodes finally brought an end to deep operations after years of fantastic booms and slumps . Today the buildings along famous C Street , the main thoroughfare , stand drunkenly awry , their paint peeled away . Many of the homes are gone . Some were torn down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still others were moved to growing towns . One was taken all the way to Los Angeles at a cost of more than $6,000 ! The famous 160-room International Hotel burned down , but the Courthouse , several  | churches , Miners ' Union Hall , bulky Fourth Ward School , and other landmarks remain . Piper 's Opera House stands unpainted , sagging , and askew . Inside , its flooring gapes in places to reveal the hand-wrought coil springs upon which the floor is mounted . Old posters and a collection of faded programs bear names of theatrical royalty who played on its sloping stage . McKean Buchanan playing Othello , Adah Menken in Mazeppa , Lotta Crabtree , James O'Neill , child star Maude Adams , David Belasco , Edwin Booth ? these and many other stars came to Virginia City . The Bloody Bucket Saloon now houses a souvenir shop , and the Crystal Bar still boasts the original elaborate chandeliers . Virginia City is a symbol of the exciting growth of Nevada , but it is more . It is a vivid chapter of Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City . Before war halted operations , several companies worked here and at nearbv Gold Hill and Silver City , excavating poor grade ore and reworking tailings for metal that earlier operators ignored or threw away . The long ravine down to Devil 's Gate is strewn with mining equipment and tailing dumps , old and new . Our Smallest State Capital Carson City , the State capital , lies in Eagle Valley only a few miles away . It is mature and serene now , but still small . Fewer than 2,500 persons live in this pleasant tree shaded town , named for Kit Carson and godfathered by Abraham V. Z. Curry and Maj. Wi11iam M . Ormsby , who was killed by the Paiutes . A rival in its beginning to Genoa , a short distance farther south , Carson City soon usurped the other 's position as transport and trade station when the rush came to the Comstock . Though it was then but a gangling shanty town , Carson City was proclaimed as perma nent capital of Nevada Territory in 1861 , shortly after the arrival of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , while Nye traveled to California by ship , were two Clemens brothers , Orion and Samuel . Orion was to serve as secretary of the Territory , and Samuel as secretary to the secretary . In a resourceful effort to separate the sen ate from the assembly when the legislature  | convened in a building loaned by Abe Curry , Orion strung up a canvas partition at a cost of $3.40 . But the United States declined to pay for it and deducted the amount from Orion 's salary ! For the truth of the story we have the authority of the secretary 's secretary , who later distinguished himself in Nevada ? and , need I add , elsewhere ? as Mark Twain . Carson City still claims a home where Mark Twain stayed and has several mansions dating from early years . Its Mint , however , which coined gold and silver until 1893 , has now been converted into a museum and displays Indian artifacts , mineral collections , and other things Nevadan . The elm-shaded capitol and many other State and business buildings are constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State prison near town ( page 5 ) . While blasting in the quarry years ago , workmen uncovered an interesting collection of prehistoric bones and found footprints in a deeply buried layer of rock . Here , in hard stone , is the trail left when big heavy-footed beasts squashed through several inches of hardening ooze beside some ancient lake or waterhole . All around are tracks of birds and what appear to have been deer and other small-hoofed creatures . Rodeos Replace Indian Clashes One day when I visited Carson City the towns- and countryfolk had turned out to enjoy a rodeo . The men who wore ten-gallon hats , blue jeans , and high-heeled boots were no dudes . They were sun-bronzed cowmen from outlying ranches who had come to have fun . Amid swirls of hoof-driven dust they roped steers , tied calves , and took jolting rides ? and spills on bucking broncos and snorting , kicking Brahman bulls ( Plate IV ) . There was prize money for the winners , but it was the sport that counted . Seconds of time in roping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score is to a country club golfer . A number of towns throughout Nevada hold rodeos on at least one week end in summer . In most places about the only concession to the mechanical age is that announcers call results over loud-speakers and some riders bring their horses to town in auto trailers . Main highway through southern Nevada is U. S. Route 95 . It winds eastward from the Truckee to Fallon , turns sharply southward to Walker Lake , and thence streaks across the desert to Tonopah , Goldfield , and on to Las Vegas . Where the last irrigation ditch in Fallon 's farmland ends , the sagebrush desert begin , A narrow banner of green marks the course the Walker River , but the blue , brackish waters of Walker Lake are hemmed by high barren hills .

Wasteland Rich in Minerals Only a few tiny settlements dot the route the rest of the way to Tonopah . Each , however , at one time or another has served as a transportation link in the chain of mining operations strung across the desert . An unbelievable variety of mineral wealth has come from this seemingly empty wasteland . Off to the south a plain glistens white with borax beds where four companies once worked . In the opposite direction were the gold , silver . copper , and lead deposits of Rawhide and other mines . Back in the 60 's , slow-stalking camels lent a Levantine touch to the dusty landscape when they hauled salt from Teels Marsh to the Comstock . For nine busy months in 1944 twenty-two giant Wells Cargo " teapots , " or specially constructed hopper-body trailer trucks , hauled 30-ton loads of magnesite ore night and day from near-by Gabbs Valley to the Basic Magnesium plant at Henderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century Jim Butler , hunting his donkey on a barren hillside , stumbled onto an exposed ledge of ore that gave rise to Tonopah . More enduring than many of the other strikes , its Mizpah , Tonopah , and other mines have brought in $160,000,000 of dore bullion ? silver mixed with a small amount of gold . After the Comstock , Tonopah is perhaps the greatest name in Nevada mining , in that its discovery came when earlier finds had largely been worked out . In quick succession new prospecting brought in Goldfield , Rhyolite , and other spectacular strikes . At its height Tonopah had some 6,000 persons . Its business buildings grew high to keep out of the way of the diggings , and few of its streets go far without having to dodge a mine dump .  | " We had perhaps 150 miles of tunnels within its three-quarter-mile-wide and threemile-long workings , " a Tonopah mine manager told me . " Ore often moved downhill to the mill at the rate of 2,000 tons a day . " An interesting note on the mill is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cyanide water seeped back into the mine wells . Faucets became silver-plated . When the mill was torn down , the water pipes were scaled and yielded $23,000 in silver ! " Since 1930 the mines have operated on a limited scale by lease , each individual miner getting a small plot along the vein . Some diggings are very lucrative . Not long ago one leaser sent out three carloads of ore in one month . It was $300-a-ton mineral and brought the tidy total of $45,000 . Just before the war Tonopah 's population had fallen to about 1,560 persons . Homes could be had for a pittance . But when the Army established an airbase near by , hundreds of families flocked in and filled up all available space . Some even fitted up sagging shacks and large garages for occupation . Tonopah seemed almost a boom town again .

Rhyolite and adjacent Bullfrog ( named for the greenish-colored ore ) , outside the little town of Beatty , never ascended the heights of Goldfield , but they have fallen even farther . Gold ore deposits that gave early rich promise soon were worked out . Vaults of two banks now gape wide ; stores are only piles of rubble ; the schoolhouse was a skeleton long before the bond issue for its building was paid . Only buildings intact are a " museum " house made from beer bottles and the railway station , which has been converted into a night club for visitors from Death Valley .

Varied Annals of Las Vegas Las Vegas is one of the oldest , and yet one of the youngest , settlements in Nevada . Successively , it has been a way stop for water , a stockaded Mormon outpost , a fort , ranch , railway division point , and now the second largest city in the State ( page 38 ) . The present town dates only from 1905 when the railway , completing the link with Salt Lake City , sold lots , provided streets and water , and assured incoming settlers employment in railway workshops .

A few miles southeast from Las Vegas is war-born Henderson , where a gigantic magnesium plant grew to utilize Boulder 's electrical power for manufacturing strategic metal from Nevada 's deposits . Part of the plant that makes chlorine is still operating . Much has been said about spotless Boulder City , built by Uncle Sam as construction and administrative headquarters for Boulder Dam . More words have been used in attempts to describe the colossal 726-foot-high block of concrete that engineers poured into the awesome canyon to dam the mad , mud-laden waters of the Colorado ( page 23 ) . Boulder Dam is shared by both Nevada and Arizona , but its whirring electrical generators and water control mean power , light , and new irrigation projects to the whole Southwest . " Has the water in the lake risen since you put in the dam ? " an overawed visitor once asked a guide . " What lake ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mead was only a river canyon and dry valley lands before the erection of the dam . One home owner at now-submerged St. Thomas , nearly 40 miles up one arm of the lake from the dam , refused to move because he felt certain the water would never reach that far . But when waves began lapping at his door , he quickly evacuated !  | Along with St. Thomas vanished the ruins of an ancient Indian settlement and some of the irrigated farmland southeast of Moapa . In years to come Lake Mead will become a novel recreation area , for it affords opportunities for swimming , fishing , sailing , and exploration by motorboat through miles of spectacular steep-walled canyons . Hard by lies the Valley of Fire , where flaming walls and fantastically eroded rocks of red sandstone tower above the valley floor , on which also are scattered petrified trees ( Plates VIII and XI ) : On the face of many of the rocks primitive red men carved strange symbols and pictures . Near by , too , is Gypsum Cave , where prehistoric man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead- and zinc-mining town of Pioche and you come to Cathedral Gorge . Here is wasteland where man would erect no tall cathedrals or skyscrapers , but erosive forces have fashioned both ( Plate VI ) . In massive cliffs of grayish-tan clays , rain and wind have found a comparatively soft , pliable medium with which to do their sculpturing . The walls hemming a narrow valley have been hewn into castles , domed shrines , pinnacles , and columned recesses beyond count .  | Eighty miles farther north , southeast of Ely , subterranean waters have created an interesting wonderland in limestone deep within the hill bastions of 13,058-foot Wheeler Peak . Lovely stalactites and stalagmites of every conceivable size and shape fill the large underground chambers and galleries . Altogether , more than a quarter of a mile of rooms and passages have been developed here at Lehman Caves National Monument . At Ruth , seven miles outside the prosperous town of Ely , man has taken a hand in reshaping the landscape . In the quest for copper , miners have torn away a hill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere on earth ( Plate XIII ) . Since operations began in 1907 , some 230 million tons of earth overburden and ore have been hauled from this single excavation . Today the pit looks like a stadium for giants ; it is a mile long , three-fourths of a mile wide , and has a maximum depth of 700 feet . And it 's still growing . Electrically operated shovels scoop ore from the benches deep in the pit and load it onto trains at the rate of 11,000 tons a day A company under contract to strip overburden for an extension to the pit is ripping  | away 30,000 tons of dirt daily . The total stripping operation to uncover more ore calls for the removal of 15,800,000 tons of earth ! Trains that haul ore from the crater have to spiral and switch up four miles of track to reach the assembly yards atop the rim . In addition to the ore extracted from this colossal open cut , underground output by the two companies Kennecott Copper Corporation and Consolidated Coppermines Corporation ? operating here and at adjacent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth round about cracks and caves from work that goes on underground . The ore from both mining companies is hauled to the Kennecott reduction plant at McGill , 22 miles away . There the metal is extracted and shipped in the form of blister copper ( pages 18 and 20 ) . Virtually all the 10,000 persons living in the Ely dis trict gain their living from copper in one way or another . U. S. Route 50 , which slices across the center of the State , fol lows a trail of spent mines . Eureka and Austin are the only towns that have sur vived . Even they are but shadows of departed prosperity . Eureka , however , has hopes of staging a comeback . Its earlier mining activity halted when its rich ore vein ended at a fault . Men have persistently probed the earth on the opposite side of the fault to find the continuation of the vein . At last they believe they have found it , far below the level of the other workings , indicating that the earth 's crust here has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you ever out of sight of bold moun tain ranges . To me , however , the most striking of them all are the Ruby Mountains , whose rocky crests rearing high above the plains are seldom free of snow . As you loop northward from Ely to Wells and cross down to Elko you ride around three sides of them . Northward also beyond the valley from Elko rise the Independence Mountains . Large copper and other mines are tucked away in the hills , but primarily these ranges and valleys are pasture lands for large herds of cattle and widely scattered flocks of sheep . Elko is the stockman 's capital of the State . Tall , tanned buckaroos swing along its streets in high-heeled shoes . Hotels , clubs , and bars buzz with the talk of cowmen . In one hotel you seldom hear anything spoken but  | Basque , for it is the gathering place for sheepherders in from the range . Elko is modern and still of the West . New bungalows and apartments nudge Victorian homes of the town 's earlier growth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress shops and in stores selling saddles , bridles , and other horse togs ( Plate V ) . Although the event was weeks away , every room in the hotel where I stayed had a sign tacked on the door stating that it was reserved for the annual Elko County Fair and stock sale . Almost everyone from the whole countryside converges on the town at that time to see the horse races , prize stock , and rural exhibits . Elko is seldom quiet . Trains of the Western and Southern Pacific thunder right through the middle of town on their route across Nevada . Down through Carlin , the red basalt can yon of Palisade , past Battle Mountain , and through Winnemucca along the Humboldt River , the roads parallel each other much of the way . By agreement , both lines now use one track for all westbound trains ; eastbound traffic rides the other . Sparks , just outside Reno , is division headquarters for the Southern Pacific line . Here the railway maintains roundhouses , switch yards , and large repair shops for reconditioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More Precious than Gold Northeast of the town of Winnemucca I climbed into the hills to see Getchell Mine , which since 1938 has produced a gross of some $12,800,000 in gold and tungsten . Largest of the present gold operations in the State , it continued to function during the war because its by-product , arsenic , was needed by the Government , as was the tungsten it milled . A rich tungsten mine , one of the three largest in the country , lies southwest of Winnemucca . Although the mills process thousands of tons of scheelite ore , you never see any metallic tungsten . Only a concentrate ? 78 percent tungsten trioxide and the rest mainly silica ? is produced . It looks like heavy gray dirt . Despite the apparent barrenness of wide areas of Nevada , it has an interesting variety of wildlife . Up in the northwestern corner of the State is a sanctuary for large herds of pronghorn antelope . Many deer and a few  | hundred elk roam the hills . Its mountain streams are well stocked with trout . Nevada , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geese , and other water fowl , and in autumn its rivers , lakes , and even municipal ponds are pausing places for the birds in flight . Riding along the Humboldt one day I came upon hundreds of white pelicans fishing in the shallow stream . They had flown over from Pyramid Lake to feed . Fish are becoming more and more scarce as the lake grows increasingly brackish and irrigation dams in the Truckee reduce spawning . An island in Pyramid Lake is the breeding ground for thousands of these huge white birds , and as guest of the U. S. Navy I later visited the rookery ( Plate XII ) . Clambering over the island we found large flocks of waddling young birds not yet old enough to fly . Overhead soared anxious adults , their white bodies and black-edged wings gleaming in the sun against the blue sky . When first hatched , the pelican chicks are about the ugliest birds that Nature ever created ; nesting grounds seem like some reeking , forgotten world of misshapen creatures . From the pelican rookery we cruised around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 475 feet . Fremont , seeing this odd upthrust in 1844 , named the lake for it . Hot chemical-laden waters spurt from its sides . Numerous tufa , or calcareous , formations surround this 30-mile-long body of water . At its northern end stand many pinnacles , atop some of which also nest numerous cormorants . Pyramid Lake lies within an Indian reservation , but during the war the Navy established an airbase in the vicinity . Here , and on the open plain , pilots gained some of their final practice in torpedo launching , strafing , and bombing before they shipped aboard carriers to the Pacific . The Navy in the desert ? this is but another of the vivid contrasts one discovers in Nevada .  |
