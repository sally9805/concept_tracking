txt The nominations of the six appointees to high posts in the State Department will be taken to the Senate floor tomorrow with widely varying votes of the Foreign Relations Committee asking for their confirmation . One of them , that of Archibald , Librarian of Congress , to be an assistant Secretary of State , did not receive official and final committee recommendation until midnight . The other five , apparently comfortably sure of Senate confirmation , were reported in the afternoon . The committee agreed unanimously to let the decision on Mr. await the results of strenuous efforts to round up the vote of two absentees , setting midnight as the deadline . Until this last minute , the contest over the author-poet was one of the most spirited , and unusual in many years , Capitol observers agreed . In the course of many changes of mind and jockeying , complicated by intricate parliamentary moves and counter moves , the committee vote on Mr. had been 12 to 8 against him , had tied twice at 10 to 10 , and shuttled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead was cut to 11 to 10 . Possibility of Tie Passes Yet , until midnight there remained a possibility that it would be tied again , in which event the nomination , said Senator Connally , Committee chairman , would be taken before the Senate " without recommendation . " This , committee attaches added , would constitute , in effect , an unfavorable report . First , the 10-to-10 tie was broken by Senator Joseph F. Guffey , Democrat , of Pennsylvania , with a vote switched by telephone after the committee had concluded a threehour closed meeting . A tie again ensued when , at another committee meeting hurriedly summoned to make his action official , he withdrew his request to change . The second breaking of the tie came when Senator Robert F. Wagner telephoned his vote for Mr. from New York , in response to urgent calls . Opponents of Mr. continued to operate by telephone to locate Senator Gerald P. Nye . Republican , of North Dakota , who was also reported to be in New York and was believed ready to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Senator Connally waited until nearly 10 P. M. , and when Mr. Nye had not been found , he closed the books on the contest and directed that Mr. 's nomination be reported , 11. to 10 . But the books did not close . At the Capitol the report was received and sent to the Government Printing Office with a warning that a cor- I rection might follow . Capitol attaches disagree as to whether a report was filed officially when it reached the hands of the committee clerk , when it was sent to the Government Printing Office or when it was the end of a legislative day or actually midnight . Midnight was decided on to prevent further confusion . Committee Room Kept Open The committee room was kept open with an executive clerk standing by to take a possible lastminute telephone call from Senator Nye . Proofs of the report were held back awaiting a possible correction . When midnight came , the report was released for printing . Two committee members did not vote , Mr. Nye and Senator Carter Glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was learned , an attempt was made to vote the proxy of Senator Glass , who is ill , in favor of Mr. . Senator Clark demanded proof of personal approval of the vote , suggesting that he would challenge it otherwise . The committee decided . Senator Connally said later , against communicating with the Senator . The other five nominees , whose qualifications have been considered at hearings since Tuesday , after a // coalition of Administration and anti-Administration Senators returned the nominations to the committee for that purpose , were reported favorably by substantial margins . But in all tests the divisions found Administration or anti , Administration members either forming coalitions again or taking unexpected positions . Before any committee votes were taken three Administration Democrats , Senators Joseph F. Guffey of Pennsylvania , James E. Murray of Montana and Claude Pepper of Florida , and Robert M. La Follette , Progressive , of Wisconsin , offered a resolution calling on President Roosevelt to reconsider ' all of the nominations . It contended that the six nominees , ' ' considered altogether " did not " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to the foreign policy of the United States . " The resolution was defeated , 12 to 4 , with its sponsors voting for it . They will meet with other Senators tomorrow morning to decide on future steps . They predicted floor opposition to some of the nominees . The other five nominations were reported to the Senate by the following votes : Joseph C. Grew , 15 to 4 ; Brig . Gen. Julius C. Holmes , 15 to 4 ; : James Clement Dunn , 13 to 5 ; Nelson Rockefeller , 12 to 7 , and William L. Clayton , 11 to 7 . Pepper , Murray Shift Votes On the first vote on Mr. , seven Democrats and one Republican supported his nomination , while five Democrats , six Republicans and one Progressive opposed it . Senator Pepper moved for a reconsideration and he and Senator Murray switched their votes to yes , thus causing the first 10-to-10 tie . Senator Guffey was the only Democrat who voted against all of the nominees , as final votes were tabulated . Senator La Follette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican , of Vermont , voted for the six nominees , Word came from the office of Senator Wagner that he had telephoned affirmative votes for five of the nominees , but withheld his vote on Mr. Clayton . It was believed , however , that his vote arrived too late to count for any other than for Mr. . Senator Pepper , speaking for himself and Mr. Murray , said that they had cast their original votes against Mr. in order to be consistent with their resolution seeking the reconsideration by the President of all the appointments . " As a matter of fact , " Mr. Pepper said , " I regard the appointment of Mr. as one of the best of the six . I certainly hope he will not be the goat . We took our position because we believe the time has come when voting on appointments to the Statel Department constitutes a voting ' on much of the future of our relaJ tions with the world at this critical time and in an equally critical future . " The committee voting was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session by Senator Guffey and others on his position on foreign policy questions , but , it was reported later , he was not interrogated on certain documents relating to the Spanish civil war which Mr. Guffey sought at the State Department last night . The data , Mr. Guffey said , had been sent to the State Department by Claude G. Bowers , former Ambassador to Madrid , during the Spanish war , but the Senator added that he had been informed that the full force of their recommendations in favor of the Spanish Republicans had not reached President Roosevelt or former Secretary Hull . It was reported after the closed meeting that Mr. Guffey had located the Bowers ' reports , that they had borne out his understanding that they were favorable to the Spanish Republicans , but that the Senators had been unable to tell from the initials on them , whether they had been transmitted to Mr. Hull . Meanwhile , the Senate confirmed the nomination of Norman Armour , now director of the State Department 's Office of LatinAmerican Affairs , to be Ambassador to Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
