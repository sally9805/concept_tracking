A short , grey-moustached man stood , looking pleased , behind the standees in Manhattan 's spacious , echoey Center Theater , and watched the red velours curtains close in front of the shadowy vault scene of Verdi 's Ada . He had a right to be pleased . For the 150 members of his troupe , it was merely the last perform-ance of another season , but for Fortune Gallo it was a milestone . His San Carlo Opera Company had wound up its 30th season , giving the U.S. public opera at popular prices , and without deficits . <P> In a world where opera is looked on as champagne &; caviar for the rich , this was a feat . The San Carlo has never had wealthy backers or subsidies . Its goal has been low-priced opera for mass audiences . In its 30 seasons it has played 9,000 times to 19,000,000 people ; and except for its first year , when it lost $700 , it has made money . Though its performances some-times creak , and its singing is as uneven as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Behind its success lies the colorful shrewdness of Impresario Fortune Gallo . Unlike top-flight opera companies , Gallo 's San Carlo keeps away from operas which are artistic monuments but financial hazards . For its 20,000-mile tour this season , 13 operas were enough . Seven of them ( Ada , Carmen , Faust , Trovatore , Rigoletto , Traviata , Boheme ) are such longtime favorites that Gallo 's troupe has given them more than 1,000 times apiece . <P> Operaman Gallo keeps out of the red by paring expenses to the bone . Instead of having an executive staff , he handles all decisions and details himself , working at a rolltop desk in a mousy Broadway office building . He pays no fancy salaries : minimum for principals is $40 a performance . On the road , San Carlo 's orchestra numbers only 23 , the total company 100-odd . Expense-conscious Fortune Gallo once spied the orchestra 's harpist strolling down the street while a Rigoletto performance was going on , angrily inquired why he was not in the pit . To the harpist 's reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not paying a harpist to walk the streets , " ordered a harp part written in . Another time , Impresario Gallo avoided the expense of through Pullmans to Toronto by sending his troupe to Scranton , Pa. on excursion rates , thence by sleepers to Buffalo , thence by day coach . Saved : $600 . <P> Fortune Gallo was a dreamy , 16-year-old Italian lad when he came to the U.S. His first job was at $3 a week , in an Italian bank , but by 1906 he had blossomed out as a band manager . When Mario Lombardi 's South American opera company got tangled in difficulties in St. Louis , Gallo was called in to help push the operatic ship off the reefs . <P> The refloating brought him a fat contract , hoisted him into the opera management business for good . Last year he received his most prestigious appointment : as managing director of the white-elephantine Chicago Opera . He and Tenor Giovanni Martinelli , artistic director , put on a season that lopped the annual loss from $125,000 to $18,000. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
