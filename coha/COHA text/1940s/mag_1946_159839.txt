The Strange Love of Martha Ivers ( Hal Wallis-Paramount ) is described by its own pressagents as " a stealthy plot of murder , false witness , assault , lust , perfidy and tender love . " The summary is too modest . The picture also includes some tidy touches of sadism , juvenile delinquency , blackmail , civic corruption , adultery and dipsomania . <P> The story begins back in 1928 , when most of the film 's principal characters are mere problem children . The youngsters get older but never any better adjusted . The little girl who inadvertently murders her horrid old aunt grows up to be a wealthy , power-mad , neurotic woman ( Barbara Stanwyck ) , living fretfully with a bad conscience and a weakling husband ( Broadway Actor Kirk Douglas ) . Meanwhile , the little boy from the wrong side of the tracks has grown up to be tough , tinhorn Gambler Van Heflin . <P> These ruthless , wretched people finally knot themselves up in such a tangle that the only way out for the plot is one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most law-abiding character is Lizabeth Scott , a blonde jailbird who looks suitably stunned by all the perfidy , lust and other such carryings-on . <P> As a high-class strumpet , Barbara Stanwyck does her usual easy , convincing job . Van Heflin , back on the screen after three years in the Army , makes the hard-shelled gambler plausible . Lizabeth Scott , a onetime fashion model , is no worse-and not noticeably better-than the other delectable , deadpan ex-models ( e.g. , Warner 's Lauren Bacall , 20th Century-Fox 's Nancy Guild ) who are currently being peddled to the public as dramatic actresses . <P> In spite of biting off more wholesale villainy than it could possibly chew , The Strange Love of Martha Ivers is strangely good in detail . The steady hand of Producer Hal Wallis , an able craftsman , shows up in some excellent individual scenes , the picture 's considerable suspense and its high , overall polish . <P> But in case Junior and Sister get the idea that it might be fun to see , suggest a nice Technicolor musical instead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at being a bouncy summertime diversion , has everything it takes except bounce . Pretty as a candy box , the picture oozes rich Technicolor , Jerome Kern music , crunchy-sweet humor and double-scoop romance . Its seven big-name players , dressed to the teeth in fetching costumes , cavort through costly 1876 sets . <P> All the effort never conjures up enough magic to lift a would-be airy movie very far off the ground . One obvious reason : Centennial Summer is loaded down with the self-conscious weight of a million dollars-plus investment . ( By now , the investment seems a pretty sure thing : the trade press has already cheerfully promised movie exhibitors that Centennial Summer means " big grosses . . . marquee lure . . . money picture . . . box-office success . " )
