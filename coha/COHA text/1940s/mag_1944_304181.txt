Bob Montgomery , Philadelphia Negro challenger for Beau Jack 's lightweight crown , stood naked in a noisy gathering . He was weighing in for his 15-round bout with Jack ( TIME , Nov. 23 , 1942 ) last week in Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden . To be eligible , he could not tip the scales at more than 135 Ib . And he was tipping them . <P> Even though he was trained to the minute and had not eaten solid food nor had a drink of water all morning , he registered slightly more than the 135-lb. mark . Chick Wergeles ( rhymes with Hercules ) , Beau Jack 's voluble little manager , let out a roar of protest . William Brush , of the Department of Weights &; Measures , called it 135 Ib. , maybe a slight bit over , but explained that the crowd around the sensitive scales would cause enough extra pressure to account for this . <P> Wergeles fumed . He said the fight was off . He said Jack would fight , but not with the title at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeopardy because of a fraction of a pound , took a long breath and held it . <P> " One thirty-five . " <P> That night , before a crowd of 19,066 , Montgomery won a split decision over Beau Jack and regained the lightweight championship . He won by some cool , canny boxing-and by holding his breath . <P> *The title at stake was the New York State Athletic Commission version of the lightweight " world championship . " The National Boxing Association , recognized by 37 states , also has a " world champion " lightweight , Sammy Angott , who fights once more before meeting Montgomery March 31.
