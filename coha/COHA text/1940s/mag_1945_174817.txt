And if it be a daughter , just bounce her on your knee , <P> And if it be a son , send the blighter out to sea , <P> With bell-bottom trousers and a coat of navy blue , <P> And let him fool the Navy the way that I fooled you . <P> This salty chantey of a too-trusting maid and her love-'em- &; - leave- 'em sailor was a favorite barroom ballad of World War I. Wherever servicemen gathered , it was sung with gusto-provided no ladies were present . <P> Last week Bell Bottom Trousers , revived as a song hit of World War II , placed first in U.S. sheet-music sales and fourth in radio performances . But the lyrics had been thoroughly scrubbed up . Veteran fathers , momentarily alarmed by the melody the bobby-soxers were singing , were quickly reassured . Songwriter Moe Jaffe 's modernized maid , as coolly respectable as a Junior League Nurses ' Aide , has the situation well in hand ; her sailor is as wholesome as an Eagle Scout .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
