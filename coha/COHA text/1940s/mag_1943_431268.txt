 | Who wrote The Business of Getting Well Many people in good health have minds very sensitive to every faint suspicion of trouble . Among sick people this sensitivity is the rule , and it can play the dickens with one in the great business of getting well . Getting well has been my business for eighteen months , and I never have found that it helped to try to dodge real worries . Problems of finance , of family adjustments , of how to tote the burden of illness in comfort must be faced and solved . Once faced , they lose their power to terrorize . But unreal worries actually are needless . Most of them come from physical causes , which encourage false views of the past , distrust of the present , and fear of things that have n't happened and probably never will . During the toxic stage of my illness , I could rise at times like a starved bass to any lure of slight funereal hue . When no lure was in sight , I manufactured one . Ii a nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ha ! I 'm worse . Much worse . " If a nurse banged in on machine-gun heels , that meant I was beyond the point where quiet could help . I had spells of trying to trick doctors , nurses , orderlies , and cleaning girls into statements out of which I could concoct a juicy worry . People like me are to blame for the maddening wariness of doctors . I remember saying to Frank , my favorite orderly , " Those second-floor patients ? they 're all in pretty good shape , are n't they ? " " Pretty good , " Frank said . " Pretty good , yah . " " Must be some real sick ones on this Boor , huh , Frank ? " " Maybe . A few , maybe . " " I guess they put all the worst cases this floor , do n't they ? " Frank gave me a funny look . " What 's use of stewing ? " he said . " You do n't a doe . All you need is somebody tell you what not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What not to think ut " rattled around in my head like bble in a drum . Even if I could track the sources of malaise , how could put them out and keep them out ? I ed for pencil and paper and began inventory of my chamber of horrors . t away I hit on an ancient truth : put writing , these complaints did n't have the effect they had when I let them about in my mind . y first item went like this : " Why this trouble happen to me ? I feel pa. put-upon , and resentful . How can that so I wo n't think about it any ybe there is a formula for handling pity ; but I believe each of us must @#  | wrestle with it his own way . My way is based on the point that self-pity makes no sense . It only plagues a fellow because he wo n't accept facts and get on with his business . As it works out , failure to accept the facts is ten times as worrisome as the facts themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I suppose all invalids are attacked now and then by the notion that they are flat on their backs because they ca n't take what the world dishes out . And so what is the use of getting well ? I am ashamed of the moments I spent exposing my faith to this poison . I would lie without a care in the world , gazing on the planting and the stately trees of the hospital grounds . and I would slowly sink up to my ears in the muck of self-reproach . Every fool thing I had ever done , every shabby act . every failure , would parade across my counterpane . What does this notion amount to ? It is simply the vicious propaganda of disc and , like all vicious propaganda , it contains a speck of truth . Many of us , course , have only ourselves to blame when we land in hospitals . But this payoff of illness is usually a heavier penalty than our sins warrant . For everyone who breaks down , ninety-nine other people . equally foolish , go their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger or more beautiful characters . saves these ninety-nine from a long hospital siege . A germ is a germ , a weak heart is a weak heart , and they do n't hold a court of justice when they go after a person . In my hospital , the hundred-odd longterm get-wellers differ in no respect , except for the accident of illness , from any department-store crowd of respectable citizens at a sale of porch furniture . Illness is an accident , frequently unjust . and perhaps that is why Providence has arranged that it is almost invariably a lucky accident . We convalescents and exinvalids have a theme song . " Until I got sick , " it goes , " I never dreamed how lovely life could be . " DURING the deep-purple moments of getting well , the future can look even more unpromising than the past . One year ago I owned a farm , with pigs and cows and horses running around and getting into all kinds of trouble . I had not been curing long when a vision of chaos and approaching bankruptcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals . A year ago the mere ownership of that farm seemed at times to entail as much crushing responsibility as the Presidency of the United States . I could fret half the night over a report that the windmill squeaked , and I could not bear to think of a future in which the squeaks might multiply . The squeaks , sure enough , did multiply , and other crises have occurred on the farm to justify my fears . But I am convalescent now , instead of sick . It 's a joy now to face these ordinary tangles of living . They have an entirely different aspect , now that the curtain of illness has lifted . I wrote in my notebook : " What Not To Think About : 1 . Do n't think about what a mess you are . If you must think about it , do it only on Tuesdays and Fridays while the bed linen is being changed . 2 . Do n't try to make any plans for the future except when you are feeling especially perky . " I know get-wellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter on a murder case involving a beautiful blonde . They keep their own charts ? temperature , pulse , respiration . They draw diagrams of the places where they are on the blink and fill their bookcases with the latest medical tomes . They prepare long and detailed memoranda of their symptoms . Maybe it 's a lot of fun ; but not for me . I never have lost my terror of medical jargon , and I do n't expect to . Many months ago I bought a medical book , and , though I still take furtive peeks in it , I invariably wish I had n't . It does n't matter where I open the book . There I am in every line and even between the lines , just as though the author had pecked out his manuscript with one hand while the other explored my anatomy for more material . Someone once invented this one-line system for getting well : " Do n't let what ails you spread above your shoulder blades . " GOOD judgment generally in reading matter is a fine defense against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will power , as I discovered when I decided to learn how to read a newspaper . Until then I had lapped up the daily welter of murders , suicides , and political hysteria with all the masochistic relish of the average healthy citizen . As a result , my entire morning , and often my entire day , was ruined . Slowly I trained myself to duck depressing items . I changed papers to avoid one columnist whom I could not resist reading even though he drove me frantic . I became an addict of comic strips , crossword puzzles , sports news , Hollywood , how to make a pineapple crumpet , and when to ask my girl friend if I might come in . I found out , to my surprise , that newspapers deal chiefly with happy things . In experiments with books , I learned that biography and history are by all odds the safest invalid fare , and the most instructive . The troubles of the past do not lead my thoughts into depressing channels , and they correct a too-dreary attitude toward the troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works of writers famed for frivolity . Current masterpieces of social significance will be read at some future date , when I 'm completely well . In the great business of getting well , " what not to think about " is a personal problem . The items I have mentioned are typical , not exhaustive . Grisly radio programs , sad songs are taboo . Serving as a receptacle for another patient 's woe never did me any good , and I doubt if it helped the person who was sounding off . Dire suspicions of doctors and hospitals are pretty silly . Most doctors and hospitals have more business than they can handle , and they are tickled to death to get rid of us when the time is ripe . But one sad thought ? the tragedy of war ? is hard to escape , and I do n't think any invalid should try to escape it This worldwide destruction of human material constitutes one of the most vital reasons why all of us who are ill must get well . It is nonsense to bewail our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lessons and values we are learning in a hospital bed will be of help to those around us when we join in the peacetime work of reconstruction .
