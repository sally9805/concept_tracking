NINETEEN STORIES ( 247 pp. ) - Graham Greene-Viking ( $2.75 ) . <P> Graham Greene deprecates these 19 stories as " byproducts of a novelist 's career . " This amounts to fair warning to readers of Brighton Rock and The Heart of the Matter not to expect anything of comparable quality . <P> The first of the 19 was written in 1929 , the last in 1948 , and like the chase-and thriller-books that Writer Greene calls his " entertainments " ( The Ministry of Fear , etc. ) , many of them seem to have been written with his left hand , or written to sell . But Greene is obviously not at ease with the short story ; it brings out his second-rate gift for contrivance and cramps his now clearly first-rate gift for dramatizing the lives of the weak-abandoned , as one of his characters puts it , " to the enormities of Free Will . " <P> Killed by Duty . People interested in Graham Greene 's view of such enormities will find six pieces in the book worth careful reading . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Party , concerned with a small boy 's helpless integrity in face of an overpowering terror . Another , The Basement Room ( recently made into a movie called The Fallen Idol ) , suggests the disastrous effect on a small boy of being made a responsible agent in an adult affair . A third , Brother , examines the troubles of a man who acts according to his principles , does his duty as a citizen , and gets another man killed . A fourth , A Chance for Mr. Lever , stacks everything in favor of the choice of sin by a middling good little man and notes his exhilaration after making it . A fifth , written last year , is called The Hint of an Explanation and deals briefly with the same theological theme as The Heart of the Matter . Besides these , there is a fragment of a novel written in 1936 ( he gave it up , wisely , to write Brighton Rock ) , in which the author intended to use the West African locale later picked as the scene of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four were written in 1936 , apparently a crucial year for Novelist Greene 's development . What gives them literary value is the clarity with which they confront the author 's religious faith with the paradoxes and atrocities of reality , including a certain " drab empty forest ... where it is impossible to believe in any spiritual life , in anything outside the nature dying round you . . . " <P> Saved by Disloyalty . " It does seem to me , " says Graham Greene in Why Do I Write ? ( just published in Britain by Percival Marshall ) , " that one privilege the writer can claim , in common perhaps with " his fellow human beings , but possibly with greater safety , is that of disloyalty ... I belong to a group , the Catholic Church , which would present me with grave problems as a writer if I were not saved by my disloyalty ... There are leaders of the Church who regard literature as a means to one end , edification . That end may be of the highest value , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different world ... As a novelist , I must be allowed to write from the point of view of the black square as well as of the white : doubt and even denial must be given their chance of self-expression , or how is one freer than the Leningrad group ?
