7HE SCHEMERS A Story NICCOLO TUCC1 T wo summers ago we had decided to stay in town and make the best of the Hudson River that flows right under our windows , of Fort Tryon Park two blocks away from us , and of the black , burning-hot , dusty roof of our apartment house . But , alas , just as we were beginning to be reconciled to this substitute for a real vacation , the mother of a former roommate of mine in college invited us to go and spend five days on her beautiful Long Island estate . Five days are better than nothing , but then they are also worse than nothing . It takes about five days to forget New York and accept the reality of true Heaven around you , and when you have just reached this point , how can you suddenly reverse the process and hope to recover from health and clean air , from the smell of flowers and the gentle shadow of green trees ? Having weighed all these drawbacks of a short vacation in my mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take along more luggage than we would need for five days , and then hope for something to happen that would result in a prolonged vacation for us . But my wife , who is apt to say good-bye the moment she arrives where she is invited , was very much against it . " I am not the type to extort invitations from anybody . . . I this and I that . . . " " Now look here , " I said . " First of all , I have known these people for years and they will not be bashful with me if they have to say no . Secondly , you must not think that we intend to impose our presence on them by any devious means . Far from it . We shall just go there and hope . Do you see anything tactless in hoping ? " She did . Hope to her , who comes from a very pessimistic family , was the height of bad manners . " And now suppose , " I said , " just for the sake of argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break one of my legs ? " " In that case , " she said , " we would all come home in an ambulance with you . " Seeing that even destiny was to pattern itself on her decisions , I quietly changed my strategy while she went on with hers , declaring for the first time in our married life that this weekend we would try to Leave town with just one suitcase , a wish expressed by me in every tone hundreds of times before . Our weekends had always looked like planned evacuations ; after ten pieces of luggage were filled , five more took the overflow , until every bag , basket , box , kerchief , and hand was filled to capacity . It had always come to the point where I was ready to throw myself on the floor and plead , " Now wrap me in tissue paper too and bury me in a suitcase . " But with all the memory of those past horrors , this was certainly a strange occasion for her to try to " please " me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all that luggage and I am determined not to repeat the errors of the past . " " But please , " I said , " ca n't we postpone my being right until next time ? May I stay wrong just once more ? Wo n't you persevere in your old errors ? " WOKE up the children and said , " Do you I know where we are going tomorrow night ? To Duck Island , to the sea , hur-ray ! " My children had never seen the sea and insisted on calling the Hudson the sea ; so after many attempts to teach them the truth , I had given up . Their notions of hydrography were rather limited , but they revealed through them an instinct for classification . The waters of the world had been divided by them into the following categories : ( a ) drops , ( b ) glasses , which are made up of many drops , ( c ) lakes . which are nothing but glasses thrown on the floor , ( d ) bathtubs , ( e ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . The idea of a non-Hudson sea excited them very much . During the morning they behaved like angels . We had a sun bath on the roof and they stayed right on the old square mat without soiling their feet on the black roofing ; they remembered not to jump and to run because that is apt to bring the ceiling down on the tenants and the tenants up to the roof and it is so unpleasant . After we had perspired a little , we had our daily tanning treatment : a big cloud of smoke was ejected from the incinerator and curled itself thickly around us , until the ashes had settled on our wet skins . At this point , as usual , we went downstairs to wash and dress up to go to the park . But oh , it was hot downstairs , with the windows tightly closed to keep the heat from coming in ( a refinement unknown to those who leave town for the summer ) , and the books and all the inanimate things had that dry perspiration of theirs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and perspire again . My wife was aging quickly from the untold suffering of deciding what she might not need . In the old days , when she still refused to adopt my point of view , she used to pack her indecision by taking alongall the things she would later discard . But this time , oh , this was time for decision indeed . She had emptied all the closets and displayed all our earthly belongings on beds , window sills , tables , chairs , dressers , and the floor . The suitcase was there , open , waiting for the miracle , and she was looking at each object , studying it , suffering in front of it all the temptations of the abundant packer . Then she closed her eyes and tried to visualize five days in all their practical details : so many sweaters , so many playsuits , so many handkerchiefs , against a background of the big murmuring trees , the tennis court , the flowers , and the glittering waters of the sea . Indeed it seemed an extremely difficult job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed . Yet I knew they did , and the thought that in six days we would again take our sun bath on the roof under that half-chewed lollipop called the sun , in the hypothesis that the real sun did not exist , confirmed me in my scheme to exploit this invitation to the bitter end . Before we left for the park , my wife said , " Will you choose from these three piles of shirts which ones you want with you ? " " All of them , " I said . " Impossible . " " All right , then I am going to pack them myself in my suitcase . " She was so horrified at the thought of my packing ( she alone knows how ) , that she agreed with me and I left with the clear conscience of the devil who has done his daily bit of evil . In the park I tried a little propaganda with the children . " What is this park ? " I asked . " Look at it . Smell the bitter asphalt from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grass . Keep Off , Keep Off ! Wherever there is a nice spot to lie down , it reads Keep Off on a stupid little sign of black wood . You would think that a man named Keep Off was buried there . " Then to mark the contrast I described the freedom of Long Island , with the cherry trees , the flowers to be picked , the sea , and they promptly repaid me with the same propaganda : they spoke about the ugliness of the park and the signs to Keep Off and they told me what the sea was like ; not a Hudson , but bigger than three Hudsons . Then they fought , because each of them felt that this was his or her secret and the other had no right to reveal it to me . At lunch they refused to eat unless their mother promised to pack all their dolls and teddy bears , and Vieri left the table to write on a large sheet of paper : FIFTY YEARS . That was how long he intended to stay . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim and not even I would support him . He contended that fifty years passed very quickly and I said : " That 's right , but vacations are not measured in those terms . " Then , while his sister was taking a nap , he and I sat on the window sill near the suitcase and I told him he must not soil his clothes , because probably they had no washing machine out in the country . After a brief interruption to help my wife drag another suitcase out of the closet , resumed my conversation with him . " And you know what ? " " What ? " " Long Island is a strange place . At times on hot days like this , it turns cold and you have to wear an overcoat . " Second interruption . My wife asked me to call the Weather Bureau , but I said , " What 's the use ? If we only stay five days it will be sufficient if we take one extra sweater along . " So we decided that a large suitcase with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might forget at the last minute , and thus the familiar procession of suitcases was brought in . Then I went to the grocer to ask for five large cardboard boxes , and they all stood there , gaping , ready to receive thing after thing in careful wrapping and in the slow thoughtful movements of my wife 's hands . Teddy bears and dolls descended into their traveling grave , I took along enough papers and books to write three novels , and we left in the usual frenzy ( " Close the doors , lock the windows , where are the keys ? Should we turn off the ice box ? Have we enough toys ? Cash this check at the superintendent 's " ) . I had won . I WAS hating the family as I usually do on such occasions . It was hard to find a cab ; when it came , the children had to go upstairs to the bathroom ; then , MAGAZINE at last , we got to the Pennsylvania Station  --  redcaps , shrieks , Population of the World with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible , microphones intoning " **35;775;TOOLONG **32;812;TOOLONG , " in pure Gregorian chant . Then we found that the five-eleven , which does n't change at Jamaica , did not run on Fridays , so we had to wait an hour under the black stairway between trains . And to amuse the children I had to dance with them and sing nursery rhymes , while my wife stood there with two winter coats on her right arm and a handkerchief in her left hand to wipe her brow . The station wagon was waiting for us . On our way out to Duck Island we began to believe in the existence of the world again as we sped up on the strip of land between the sound and the bay and saw sailboats and people in shirts and pants as white as sails ; then we felt in our stomachs the pleasant skimming sensation of driving over gravel , and finally we got there . My wife would of course greet our hostess with one of those pieces of polite nonsense it takes generations of good upbringing to learn : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want us for a long weekend ? " I pinched her on the arm , Vieri shouted , " She does ! " and Bimba began to cry . The nonsense of her politeness became even more apparent as the chauffeur began to unload our luggage . " You see , " I said to our hostess , " all these suitcases and boxes contain bricks we have brought from New York to build ourselves a cottage on your estate . " Vieri took me to task at once : " Oh father , please let 's build a cottage here . " " Shut up , " I ordered , " and go up-stairs . " They ran upstairs and from there shouted at the top of their voices , " Look , but look , please , we are here ! " Then came the adventure of the bath , and where did the water go , and was it from the sea , and , if not , where did it come from , and could they see the plumbing all the way to New York , oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vieri inspected all the rooms and counted fourteen beds . There was a bunk room and he wanted to sleep there , but it was at the other end of the house with two squeaky doors to pass , so we said , " No . Tomorrow night if you behave . " Then supper on the porch and Vieri refused to drink his milk , so I whispered something into his ear and he shouted back , " Oh no ! You said fifty years and not two weeks ! I wo n't drink my milk if we arc only to stay two weeks . " " What nonsense ! " I shouted . " Who ever spoke of such things ? " " You , " said Vieri and looked at me with indignation . He was technically right , but I had not quite  --  that is to say  --  anyway , no explanation was possible , and my wife said in her gentle voice , " I think it will be better if we go back Sunday night instead of Tuesday . " " You stay out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something between father and myself . I must have a chance to behave and make no noise , and it will take me much longer than that . " O FT , how good it was to be awakened next morning by the birds , so many of them , near and far away , and they sang clean sunrise and not thick fog and perspiration as they do in town . I woke the children and we ran down barefoot to the beach , where I told them to shout as much as they could so as to use up all their shouting reserves for the day . Then they ran down the slope and Vieri felt that he could run faster than anything on earth . As we came back and went through the house I went after them from room to room , asking them to tone down , reminding them of our secret plan : " Prudence , prudence . We , the schemers , must be careful if we want to attain our goal . " I was making signs with my hands as if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything brought out the instinctive generosity of their souls . For example , later on while we were playing on the beach Bimba ran away shouting , " Wait for me here , I am going to tell Mrs. R. that the sea is here . " Vieri of course ran after her to be the first to give the news , and after a fight under the trees , she came back to me crying and he joined us a few minutes later . " That was very unfair , " I began . But he said , out of breath , " Oh no , you do n't know what I have done . I have been very kind . I have shown Mrs. R. the sea and she said thank you . " More shrieks from Bimba who wanted to be kind too . What could I say ? Of course he had been kind and I could n't ask him to be a hypocrite , to be kind the way we grown-ups are . So I began to give up my scheme of staying there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were true that she disliked children who make noise , she reproached me very bitterly and said in his presence , " I think children should make noise , even though we grown-ups are not always in a mood to enjoy it . " " And now , " said my son to me in Italian , " now tell her about the fifty years and also about always . " My defeat as a schemer could not have been greater . The only one who triumphed was my wife , but sadly , as befits a civilized person of her type . She discovered that our hostess expected a great number of her grandchildren at the end of the coming week . " And obviously , " she said to me , " she invited us only because you must have said something to her the last time you saw her in town . Otherwise , " she concluded , " there would be no point in inviting noisy people like ourselves for the only weekend in which she might enjoy a little rest . " " Nonsense , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's you who ruined everything . You made me so self-conscious that I told the children that she did not like their noise . This upsets all my plans now . " Vieri came in and said in a patronizing tone , " Never mind , Father . Mother does n't know . We can stay even if she has guests . I have counted fourteen beds , and there are couches too , and I can sleep on the floor . And tonight , " he added , " I shall sleep in the bunk room , as you promised yesterday . I behaved and was even kind and Mrs. R. liked my noise . " vr prepared his bed in the bunk room and all during dinner we ran upstairs in turn to see how well he could climb into bed without the ladder and how well he could come down the same way . His voice resounded like a trumpet all through the house ; the doors were continuously swinging back and forth as we passed them in a hurry ; and the two doors that Ied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was impossible for me to impress upon our hostess the desirability of continuing this sort of vaca , tion much longer . " Poor child , " she said to my wife , " you must be very tired . " " I am not tired , " said my wife . " I am anxious to go back to town so you wo n't hear this awful noise all day long . " " Oh , never mind me , " said our hostess . " I think you are very wrong in this . You should leave your children free to make all the noise they want . As I told your husband , I think children must be noisy . " In the night , however , her opinion too must have changed , not because the night brings counsel , as they say , but because that night brought noise , a great deal of it . Vieri came to my room at two to tell me a dream ; he slammed all the doors , and finally bumped into a wall , so that instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain , and as soon as that was over he cried even more loudly than before because he had forgotten the dream . I consoled him and we exchanged beds . I went into the bunk room and he slept in my bed . Under my feet the stairs squeaked much more distinctly than they had for him , and also the squeaking of the doors seemed to respond much better to the experienced hand of a grown-up . Then , just as I had climbed into his bed , he came again , preceded by the entire sequence of the same noises I had just stopped producing , and he wanted his teddy bear . " You will not go back , " I said . " Yes , I will , " he said . " No , " I said , but he ran away , stumbled twice , and gnt to the end of his journey crying so loudly that the entire house must have heard him . I wanted to go and frighten him into silence with the most horrible threats , but I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed where I was , whispering an uncontrollable " Sssssshhh " in the direction of the door . fr-pH.E next day , which was Sunday , our a mho- 1 ' ; rt.ri qairl sn . It was decided that I would act as an absorbent of whatever noises the children were going to emit that afternoon , but alas , right after lunch , while our hostess was taking a nap , they discovered in the room adjoining hers the strangest collection of drawings made right on the walls and the ceiling by the guests who had come to Duck Island years before . When I saw their wide-open eyes I realized immediately that the situation measures ; re - , quired emergency easures ; so instead of applying the technique of an orchestra conductor , I said to them : " Children , the first of you to say that this is beautiful will be punished . " Vieri looked at me for a second , and when he saw that I was trying hard not to laugh , he said to his sister : " Bimba , father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to shout : " Uhuuuu , what horrible pictures , uhuuuu , what a horrible house , uhuuuu , how disgusting everything is ! " And they laughed so convulsively that my wife emerged from the room where she was blueprinting her next packing job . She grabbed Vicri by the arm and went with him to the end of the corridor . There she stopped in front of the old American clock and said , " See this clock ? Look at it . Every minute that goes by on that clock will never come back . We are leaving Tuesday afternoon at three ; you still have forty-eight hours to play outside , after which you wo n't go to the seashore for the rest of the year . Now you know it . Go out and play , and do n't come back before supper time . " Vieri disentangled his arm from her grip , looked at the clock and said , " That clock is a dirty swine . Tfu ! " He went through the motion of spitting on it . My wife went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around him quite badly . She did n't dare touch him and #bring out the noises of which he was so full . Then she dispatched us three downstairs with the gesture of the Angel that banished Adam and Eve from Heaven . I could n't help laughing . I felt sorry for the clock . It had such a gentle old face with those Roman numbers and the little house and tree painted in the middle . But what does one say when a child insults a clock ? " Nice thing , to laugh , " she said . " Those are the words he learns from your political discussions with your friends . " So my son had a political thought and said , " That clock is Hitler . " The rest of the afternoon Bimba stayed around her mother to help her pack the dolls , and Vieri tried to bargain with me : " Tell Mother that I will be good . I want you to change every single idea in her head . " " Enough of this , go out and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Go out and play . " " I will eat everybody 's soup . I will sleep all afternoon . " " It is not a question of that , my son , we have to go . " " I 'll stay here alone . " " No . " " But I will help . " " No . " " But there are fourteen beds . " " Listen . Do you remember what Mother said about that clock ? " His last question was quite sad : " Does it go all the time ? " " Yes , it goes all the time . " " But I do n't want that . " This was his protest all during Monday and Tuesday . The weather was beautiful , but he sat in the darkest corner of the porch , with his face in his hands , looking at the cricket balls with which he had played so well the day before , and doing nothing . He did n't want to run faster than anything in the world ; he was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked : " Is tomorrow the last day ? " And he fell asleep mumbling : " I do n't want that . " The last day of his fifty years , of his millions of years . It was quite sad . T UESDAY at three o'clock we left with all our luggage , our regret , our winter coats , and our handkerchiefs to wipe our brows . At seven , with God 's help and assistance , we entered the apartment in town , and it smelled like the inside of the Pyramids . I opened all the windows . The tanning cloud was being blown into our house from the neighboring roof now . The sun was there , shaven of all its glorious crown of rays , the same pink lollipop that had nothing to do with shedding light on anything , because the world was all in pencil , dusty and gray as an unframed etching on top of a hot radiator . The tugboats were spitting something white in front of them , and that was water . It was real home again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on my bed patting my wet knees with my wet hands , the phone rang . From Long Island . Oh , if we could only smell the clean air through the receiver . There came the voice of our hostess : " Did you get home safely ? Is it hot in town ? How arc you all ? By the way , do you know that my clock stopped today for the first time in years , and that the pendulum is missing ? " " Hold the line , " I said , " I 'll be right back . " " Vieri , Vieri ! " I shook him out of his slumber . He was naked , wet , and suffering . He turned his face to me without opening his eyes . " Vieri , " I said , " do you remember that clock ? " He was snoring again , but a voice came , " That clock is Hitler . " " Yes , " I said , " but where is the pen-dulum ? " His hand pointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , in Long Island . " " But where in Long Island ? " " Under the dresser . " Ile scratched his eyes with anger as the perspiration was falling into them from his hair and went back to sleep , still mumbling something against his great enemy .
