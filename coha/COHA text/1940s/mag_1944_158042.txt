Murder at Pavie <P> Eighteen Canadian soldiers and a Canadian officer had been captured by the Germans , then " wilfully " murdered . The shocking announcement was based on a factual investigation by an unhurried and " completely dispassionate " joint U.S.British-Canadian Court of Inquiry . Details were meager and evidence undisclosed . But it was known that the murders had occurred at Pavie , on the Caen-Bayeux highway , two days after Dday . Thirteen of the victims had been machine-gunned in a group . The Germans responsible were " members of the 12th SS Reconnaissance Battalion of the 12th SS Panzer Division . " ( The SS murderers , reported Canadian Pressman Ross Munro , had been Hitler Jugend-most of them less than 20 years old . ) <P> " These Canadian soldiers , " said Prime Minister Mackenzie King in the House , " had the status of prisoners of war and . . . met their deaths in a manner . . . clearly in violation of the well-recognized laws and usages of war . " * <P> Canadians groaned for revenge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normandy , where the announcement of the murders was posted for all Canadian troops to see , Lieut . General H. D. G. Crerar cautioned his men against retaliation in kind . " Instead , " said he , " Canadian anger must be converted into a steel-hard determination to ... hit harder , to advance faster . . . . " <P> <P> <P> * The Geneva Convention of 1929. to which Germany was a signatory , clearly states that " prisoners of war shall at all times be humanely treated and protected . . . . " Canadians had forgotten that , as far back as October 1942 , Berlin had announced the intention to repudiate the Geneva Convention , promised the Allies a " war of atrocities .
