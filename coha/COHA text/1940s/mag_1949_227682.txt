MAGISTER LUDI ( 502 pp. ) - Hermann Hesse-Holt ( $5 ) . <P> When Hermann Hesse won the Nobel Prize in 1946 , few U.S. readers had ever heard of him . Magister Ludi , his last and his greatest book , is not likely to make Hesse popular with them , but it will at least serve to give them an idea of what his dry , remote , ironic and highly individual writing amounts to . Hesse was born in Germany 72 years ago , wrote autobiographical novels and lyric poetry in his youth-he is considered one of the best German lyric poets since the age of Goethe - became a Swiss citizen during World War I in protest against German militarism . He traveled in India , wrote a volume on Hindu mysticism in his middle years , published a Dostoevskian psychological , novel in 1930 and after 15 years of silence brought out his masterpiece in 1945 . <P> Magister Ludi has an underlying theme as savage as some of Jonathan Swift , but it is written in an elegant , leisurely , almost wearily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laid in some remote and undefined future , purports to be a study of the career of one Joseph Knecht . Hesse is not so simple as to imagine that biographers in the future will write like those of the present . Many dates , names and places will mean little then , and many historical events nothing . This biographer of the future in the present rambles and rapturizes , leaves out everything a contemporary would regard as essential information and is , by current standards , as dull as Historian Robert Sherwood might have seemed to Suetonius . <P> Variable Alphabet . It appears , however ( by page 320 ) that after a satiety of bloodshed and moral corruption , " a colossal need arose for truth and justice , for reason and for some form of order out of the chaos . " The very alphabet and the multiplication table had become instruments of power politics , and were liable to be changed from one moment to the next . There was a growing longing for reason and " the rediscovery of a common idiom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this need arose the Order of . Eastern Wayfarers , a semi-religious body composed originally of scholars and musicians . Members were chosen as students , sent to elite schools , from which only the best were selected to become members of the Order . Since they were not allowed to marry , they were much favored as lovers in the towns where they received their training ; after they became members , they followed lives of chastity . But to the biographer of the future , sex is of little interest and the subject is otherwise scarcely mentioned . <P> Out of the monastic life of the Order came the Bead Game , a kind of synthesis of human learning , which , in its subtlety , resembled both the chess game of master players and the improvisation of great musicians . One player stated a theme , perhaps a thought of a great philosopher , or a phrase of some medieval musician ; his opponent replied with a complementary phrase , or with one opposing it , or related to it , and the Game proceeded , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ingenious . The greatest players became the leaders of the Order , and the greatest of all its central authority , the Magister Ludi ( master of the Game ) , who was regarded by the members as almost a god .
