THE LAST TIME I SAW PARIS-Elliot Paul-Random House ( $2.75 ) . <P> Global , bearded Elliot Paul is one of the rare writers who has been able to turn an amiable yen for the gutter into pay dirt . If publishers ' advance sales figures mean anything , some 25,000 readers were waiting avidly last week for this naughtily natural history of a Paris side street . <P> Paul is the author of the best-selling The Life and Death of a Spanish Town , of two best-selling murder mysteries , and of three worst-selling novels ( Indelible , Impromptu , Imperturbe ) . He is the ex-coeditor of the esoteric expatriate magazine , transition , and an expert on boogie-woogie and the accordion . He is the man who introduced into the Massachusetts Legislature a bill ( defeated ) forcing book &; play censors to pass an intelligence test and to prove that their sex lives were normal . <P> The Last Time I Saw Paris is a loving , microscopic peep at the infusorial life of the block-long rue de la Huchette ( just off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedonistic heaven . Its hotels , bars , bordello and habitues exhale for him the garlicky breath of the real France- " the France one prefers to remember . " Mostly they stagger between the tough tenderness of a Daumier cartoon and William Locke 's The Beloved Vagabond . They also suggest a reason for France 's fall . <P> Author Paul discovered his beloved street one soft summer night in 1923 , when it was still possible " to do things without premeditation . " After dropping into " the most perfect small Gothic church in France , St. Severin , " he picked up a trollop named Suzanne . She steered him into the rue de la Huchette . <P> France Found . The rue de la Huchette runs parallel to the left bank of the Seine for some 300 yards . On one corner stood a tiny police station . Usually the cops tried to chase the drunks , their commonest clientele , into another precinct . The Paris police , says Author Paul , were " almost saintly ... in their gentleness and understanding . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store . " When surprised by the even more astonished agents , " the marauder wounded one of them . " He was kicked to death that night , on the cold stone floor of our little . local station , and , with intestines steam-ingly exposed , was lugged under a cheap stiff blanket to the morgue . . . . That ended the unfortunate affair . " <P> Across from the police station was Le Panier Fleuri ( The Flower Basket ) , " the neighborhood bordel run by Madame Mariette . " The other corner was occupied by a laundry " which employed three hardworking girls and also served as a clandestin . That is to say , men who found it banal to patronize the orthodox establishment could , if they were known to Mme. <P> Lanier , go upstairs with the laundress of their choice . " <P> At the other end of the rue de la Huchette stood the Hotel du Caveau . Thither Suzanne steered Author Paul . After losing Suzanne , Author Paul sat down at a table awash with Dubonnet .
