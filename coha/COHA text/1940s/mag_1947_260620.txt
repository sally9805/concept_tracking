Pittsburgh 's " Carnegie " is the biggest U.S. art show ; the " Chicago Annual " ranks second . That 's the way it has been for the past 50 years . Last week Chicago , tired of running second , put on a provocative show that was certainly the biggest and strangest of its kind . There was hardly a recognizable landscape or embraceable nude to be seen . Said one headline : WITCHES ' ORGY COVERS ART INSTITUTE WALLS . The directors of Chicago 's usually middle-of-the-road Art Institute had gone all out with a survey of abstract and surrealist art in the U.S. <P> The Chicago Daily News 's Critic C. J. Bulliet led the sneering section with the remark that " these ' ' isms , ' grown stale and sterile in the lands of their origins , are further enfeebled crossing the Atlantic . " Whatever the critics might say , Director Daniel Catton Rich was convinced that he was showing not the dead hand of the past but the shining face of the future . Only ten years ago , documentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beautiful vacation views had been the style . Now , Institute scouts , back from a 24,000-mile trip around the U.S. , had convinced Rich that abstractionism is " the prevailing mode for most artists under thirty . " <P> The show 's top prize ( $1,000 ) went to Abstractionist William Baziotes , 34 , a diffident little Manhattanite who had been almost unknown outside of his tight , bright circle of admirers . Baziotes ' winner was an undulant , candy-pink , two-legged shape with one big blue eye . After he had finished it , he decided what to name it : Cyclops ( see cut ) . <P> When Baziotes begins a painting he has no idea how it will turn out . " The subject matter may be revealed in the middle of the work , " he explains , " or I may not recognize it until a long time afterward . " Instead of starting with something in nature , he begins by doodling . Each morning he lines his doodles-in-progress up against the walls of his studio . " They are my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I am like at the moment . " <P> To Institute Director Rich , the doodle called Cyclops seemed " a rather gentle , nice monster . "
