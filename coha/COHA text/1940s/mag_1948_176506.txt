INTRUDER IN THE DUST ( 247 pp. ) - William Faulkner-Random House ( $3 ) . <P> <P> Yocknapatawpha County , bound by the Tallahatchie and Yocknapatawpha Rivers in northern Mississippi , is one of the most remarkable landscapes created by the American imagination . Notably similar to <P> Lafayette County , where William Faulkner lives , it has become , in the novels of this most powerful of present-day American novelists , a symbolic place suggesting the diseased condition of the South and the entire modern world . In fiercely Gothic melodramas Faulkner has spun out his cobwebby legend of the South . Intruder in the Dust is the latest installment of that legend . <P> Creatures of Decay . Faulkner 's view of the South has no trace of **27;493;TOOLONG romanticism ; it is tough and realistic , even if sometimes debatable . From novel to novel , weaving backward and forward in patterns of time as intricate as his twining sentences , Faulkner has developed his picture of a society devastated by war-a society that was both honorable and doomed by an inherent guilt . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty but cursed by the shame of slavery . It had to fight and was doomed to lose . <P> In the ruins of the war , Faulkner shows the mean-spirited and hard-driving Snopeses , poor whites who absorbed the cheap commercialism of the carpetbaggers , rising to economic and social power by defeating the Sartoris clan , impotent aristocrats talking about the code of chivalry but unable to bring it to life . Faulkner is especially adept at portraying the creatures of the decayed South : Gowan Stevens , a gentleman of the old school , who learned to drink in a Virginia college but not to overcome his cowardice ; Flem Snopes , who would not hesitate to stamp on every living creature to satisfy his greed ; and the famous Popeye , a ghastly symbol of machine-age amorality , with the " vicious depthless quality of stamped tin .

Two main characters dominate the novel . One is Charles Mallison , a 16-year-old boy who , in the scheme of the book , represents innocence and freshness , the potentiality of Southern white manhood unspoiled by ancient hatreds . Counterposed to Charles is Lucas Beauchamp , an old Negro farmer with some white blood in his veins , who lives in solitary dignity on a patch of land bequeathed by a white ancestor . Lucas Beauchamp is one of the most magnificent and majestic characters in all American fiction . " Solitary , kinless and intractable , apparently not only without friends even in his own race but proud of it , " he suggests the reserve and strength of a people inured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
