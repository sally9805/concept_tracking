The National Labor Relations Board this week told U.S. labor unions some of the things they can &; can not do on a picket line . In general they can not try to prevent those who want to work from working . The unanimous rulings were the first of their kind under the Taft-Hartley law . Some of the new rules of etiquette : <P> No chasing in autos after non-strikers . <P> No blocking of driveways to the plant 's parking lots . <P> No blocking by mobs of entrances to plants . <P> One old and favorite practice of pickets was still all right . Under the Taft-Hartley guarantee of free speech , pickets could still vilify strikebreakers , yell " scab " to their heart 's content .
