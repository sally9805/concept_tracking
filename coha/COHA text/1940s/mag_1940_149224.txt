Last Saturday night 300,000 regular , National Guard and reserve soldiers wound up the first week of the Army 's greatest peacetime maneuvers and went to town to act like brutal soldiery on their night off . In northern New York , where 82,000 are in camp , saloons were not well attended . Most soldiers headed for soda fountains , fought their way through such concoctions as " General Drum Specials " ( marshmallow sundaes ) and " First Army Maneuvers Splits . " This behavior was too much for an old Army sergeant , who groused to the New York Times : " Yes , and they all carry miniature cameras , too . "
