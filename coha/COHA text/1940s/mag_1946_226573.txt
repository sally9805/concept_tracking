Deep in the oak and pine timberlands of the Southwest , a headsaw whined through the soft June night . Now &; again the hooting of horned owls broke into the steady cough of the gasoline engine , the dull banging of the sawmill carriage , the slap , slap of cut slabs . At dawn , the fireflies and the old crew left the sawmill and the day gang took over . <P> In the timber stands of Texas , Arkansas , Louisiana , Oklahoma , this nocturnal scene was common last week . More than a thousand " peckerwood " ( portable ) sawmills had suddenly appeared and gone into frenzied production . The piles of lumber around them , and the permanent mills , covered acres ( see cut ) . But little of it was moving legitimately into the lumber-starved housing industry ; it was apparently being hoarded to cash in on high-prices if OPA ceilings came off . <P> The total extent of the cache is estimated at 400 to 500 million board feet , less than prewar 's normal stock , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broken Bow , Okla. the lumber was piling up . Lumbermen said they were " curing it . " But up till a few months ago , many of the yards had shipped it green . Said one Texas lumberman after flying over the area : " It looked like there were acres of lumber around some of those mills . " <P> And as lumber piled up , houses all over the U.S. stood half-finished ; black-market lumber prices soared . <P> In Pittsburgh , lumber was being bought at 30% over the legal price . Boston builders have to pay from $200 to $500 per 1,000 feet for oak flooring ; ceiling price is $150 . But the peckerwoods have plenty .
