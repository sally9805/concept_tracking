Formal Defense <P> Sir : <P> DELIGHTED TO SEE THAT WAVE OFFICERS NOW HAVE FORMAL EVENING UNIFORMS TIME , NOV. 1 . RECOMMEND LIBERAL INCREASE IN NAVY BUDGET FOR SUCH VITAL NATIONAL DEFENSE PROJECTS . <P> W. WALTER HAYUM <P> Reading , Pa . <P> Note to Reader Hayum : officers buy their own. - ED . <P> The Id &; I <P> Sir : <P> Resounding plaudits to TIME for a remarkably lucid and informative article on psychiatry TIME , Oct. 25 . If I may be permitted so metaphysical an expression , my faith in journalism as a vital factor in public education is renewed . <P> THOMAS JACKSON INGRAM III <P> Washington , B.C. <P> Sir : <P> . . . The ones who are being " done good " are the psychoanalysts at $25 per hour for a couch sance that the patient could get from any fortune-teller for a dollar . . . <P> D. S. HAYES , M.D. <P> Washington , D.C. <P> Sir : <P> . . . You present a difficult and controversial subject . . . with a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . But . . . is n't there a misprint under the picture by Artzybasheff ? Should n't it be " We Are Getting to the Bottom of Id " ( not " It " ) ? . . . <P> W. GORDON <P> Ross Berea , Ky . <P> Sir : <P> ... It seems to me that . . . Dr. Will Menninger 's campaign to sell a regrettably oversold psychiatry to the U.S. public might better have won the story a Business head rather than Medicine . <P> I would also like to take issue with you on ... the overemphasis of conflict in the human personality . One could easily assume therefrom that mental health is reachable through the elimination of conflict . This is not so . Conflict is as natural to man as his desire to avoid it . . . <P> It would have been better to posit the situation in terms of balance . Then you would have reminded your readers of a basic truth-that emotional buoyancy and mental stability come , not so much from the resolution of conflict , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance between drives of varying intensity . . . <P> You quote Dr. Menninger as saying : " One does not have to know the cause of a fire to put it out . " While I have long suspected that some doctors simply buried their mistakes , I had hoped that psychiatrists at least analyzed theirs . Did the good doctor ever try to put out an oil fire the same way he 'd douse a paper one ? <P> JACK PERLIS <P> Brooklyn , N.Y . <P> Sir : <P> MENNINGER ARTICLE IS OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTION TO MENTAL HYGIENE MOVEMENT . CONGRATULATIONS . <P> BOARD OF DIRECTORS <P> Southern California Society for Mental Hygiene <P> Los Angeles , Calif . <P> Sir : <P> ... As suggested by TIME , I read the article in connection with Religion . . . The religionists have it , by far . For whether you " renounce " with Buddha , " resign " with Thomas Kempis , or " respect the Infinite " with Santayana , the end result in each case will be the same : the " peace of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in earnest about this pursuit , couches are unnecessary . . . <P> GEORGE DE HAAN <P> Monrovia , Calif . <P> R.A.F.
