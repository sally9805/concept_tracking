" There 's nothing amazing about what I 've done . There are thousands of guys in the country who could do the same thing . Let more little fellows like myself have the subcontracts and you will really see the defense program roll . Even the machinery problem wo n't bother them . Those fellows can make their own . . . . " <P> <P> Homer Clayton Price , who said this , is turning out $60,000 worth of aircraft accessories under subcontract for Cleveland 's Pump Engineering Service Corp . ( which makes hydraulic parts for Martin bombers ) . He is doing it with machine tools he built or converted himself . His factory is the dining room , kitchen , laundry , one bedroom , and garage of his middle-class Columbus , Ohio home . Two of his 22 employes are ex-convicts whom he met at the Ohio State Penitentiary . <P> No jailbird himself , Homer Price was superintendent of the Pen 's machine shop . Thither last spring went a representative of Pump Engineering with the offer of a $30,000 subcontract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , borrowed $3,000 , began converting his hillside home into a machine shop . Since precision machinery for aircraft parts was nowhere to be found , he made his own . <P> <P> He redesigned a 50-year-old pipe-threading machine into a milling machine , a 40-year-old spindle drill press into a vertical milling machine . To start production he hired five Ohio Pen ex-convicts . Three of them , a burglar and two forgers , have since left him for better jobs. * His other employes include students from Ohio State 's engineering school , a neighbor , a penitentiary guard on vacation , and his wife . By last week they were on a three-shift , seven-day basis , and Price 's home-built machinery has increased to five lathes , three drill presses , three milling machines , three grinders , a press , a power hacksaw . His original subcontract has been doubled . <P> <P> Only his house has suffered . Its ground floor is all factory . The second floor is part factory , part office , part living quarters . On the third floor is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slow-spoken Homer Price was orphaned at eleven , at 16 went to work as a machinist . During World War I he machined for the U.S. Navy ; after the Armistice he got his job at the Pen . Because his wife and daughter were interested in outboard motor racing , Homer Price in 1923 bought a bench drill press and lathe , installed them in his dining room , made parts for outboard motors which he sold commercially . ( That is how the Cleveland Pump people heard about him . ) His wife " is more at home in a machine shop than in a kitchen , " can do any job in the shop . She also pops the corn with which Homer feeds his own hobby : crickets . He keeps several hundred around the shop , singing in time with the power lathes . <P> <P> * Other Ohio State Pen alumni : Trainrobber Al Jennings , Bankrobber O. Henry .
