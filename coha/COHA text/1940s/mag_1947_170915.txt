The deadly , premeditated dullness of financial ads last week brought scornful shouts from two premeditating wits . In an address before the New York Financial Advertisers Association , Bernice Fitz-Gibbon , ad boss of Gimbel Bros. , snapped that it was time banks stopped such " pious pronouncements " as these : " a great institution founded on the cornerstone of service and courtesy " ; " the challenge of a new era demands the ultimate in achievement . " Said she : " One bank says ' You are invited to use the name of this bank on your checks . It is a symbol of strength and security . ' What a lot of malarkey . If a check 's good , it 's good . Everybody will honor it . " <P> It was not the adwriters themselves who should be blamed for such marble rhetoric , said Miss Fitz-Gibbon , but " the heavy hand of the heavy head of the heavy institution . . . . Every president ought to be kept out of advertising . " <P> Manhattan 's Billy Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dullness of financial ads , gave a Rosey example of how they might be done : " AMALGAMATED GOULASH-The Stock That Has Everything !
