If the weather had been as good for seven days as it was for three , last week would have been an Allied airman 's dream week . Even in spotty weather air power dealt the Germans bitter blows . <P> On the best flying days , half of everything the enemy tried to move to the front was estimated to have been wiped out or halted . In the first twelve days of the offensive , Allied aircraft destroyed or damaged 775 tanks , 3,300 motor vehicles . <P> In the first seven flying days Allied heavies and mediums poured nearly 35,000 tons of bombs on German supply centers , pummeling the foe 's rail and road junctions close to the front , pocking his airfields . <P> More than 1,000 German aircraft had been destroyed ( against Allied loss of about 300 ) . Such attrition sapped the Luftwaffe 's hoarded strength at once : it flew an estimated 800 sorties on its first day , but by its third day could manage only 400 sorties . With some 12,000 planes at his disposal , Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7,000 daily sorties . <P> The complete story was yet to be told , but there was no doubt of air support 's momentous part in blunting the German attack . And there was no doubt in Allied airmen 's minds that , given clear days , aviation could be the decisive factor in turning the Germans ' offensive into their worst defeat in the west .
