txt Persian Influence Seen The discussion of the modernism of the new municipal asphalt plant on the East River Drive seems to have quite overlooked the fact that this elliptical arch is no wild , modernistic fancy , but it is almost identical with the Sasanian elliptical arch which dominated the facade of all monumental buildings in Persia from the second to the seventh century , only gradually giving way to the pointed arch . It was selected apparently because of its presumed superior stability , and was frequently of majestic proportions . The still-standing arch of the Palace of Khusrau at Ctesiphon , south of Baghdad , is 121 feet high and 84 feet wide . It is the largest portal arch standing anywhere . Both our discussions and practice of modern architectural forms would benefit from a more thoughtful study of ancient models . ARTHUR UPHAM POPE . New York , May 3 , 1944.
