Dr. Charles Earl Sando , 45 , U. S. Department of Agriculture biochemist , gets rather excitable when he has two cocktails in succession . One evening last week he had three . But it was quite an occasion . Philadelphia 's Franklin Institute had opened the first big public showing of Dr. Sando 's neat method of preserving biological specimens ( and almost anything else , for that matter ) in blocks of transparent , synthetic resin . <P> Entomologists have occasionally found ancient insects beautifully preserved in hunks of amber , which is fossilized natural resin . It occurred to Dr. Sando that if a suitable substance could be found , the same sort of thing could be done deliberately . After much experiment he chose Plexiglas , a mixture of monomers ( methyl methacrylate , ethyl methacrylate , etc. ) which hardens into a glassy plastic . In blocks of this stuff he immured small dead frogs , a tarantula , the bones of a human hand ( see cuts ) ; a rattlesnake 's head , complete with fangs , a peacock feather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears of corn , ears of barley . Secretary Wallace , Dr. Sando 's chief , keeps a 13-inch ear of hybrid corn , forever young and fair , imbedded in Plexiglas on his desk . Spectators marveled last week at the realistic look of tiny hairs on the tarantula . <P> Like Secretary Wallace , Biochemist Sando* is an enthusiastic boomerang thrower , and he has made some fine boomerangs from Plexiglas for the Wallace group of boomerangers . The first ones were transparent , and so hard to see that , when they boomeranged , they sometimes bopped the thrower . Now Dr. Sando makes his boomerangs of red Plexiglas . <P> <P> *The family name was originally Sandow . Dr. Charles is a distant relative of Eugene Sandow , famed oldtime strongman .
