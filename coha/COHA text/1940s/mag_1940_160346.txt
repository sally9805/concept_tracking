Last week the final counts were coming in from each of the 3,072 counties of the U. S. In a few States-Washington , Massachusetts , Missouri , Kansas . New Hampshire-the fate of Governors depended on the final count , a recount , or perhaps on the tally of absentee ballots . Election oddities bubbled out of the county tallies : in Lincoln County , N. Mex. , old stamping-and-shooting ground of Billy the Kid , Willkie and Roosevelt were tied . So were they in Gilpin County , Colo. , in Marinette County , Wis . In almost uninhabited Armstrong County , S. Dak. , nobody voted . <P> The vote by counties ( see map ) illustrated the great main trend of the 1940 election : industrial centres had voted for President Roosevelt , rural counties for Wendell Willkie . Every city of more than 400,000 , with the exception of Cincinnati , went for President Roosevelt . The President won Illinois by only 94,000 votes . But Chicago gave him a plurality of 295,206 , and the same city-county discrepancy appeared in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular vote of the nation ( see p. 67 ) . He carried approximately 52.5% of the popular vote outside the Solid South ( where , nevertheless , the Democratic majority dropped from 4.4-10-1 in 1936 to 3-5-to-1 ) . <P> Here &; there candidates had spent an uncomfortable week on the anxious seat : <P> In New Hampshire Republican Robert Blood was still considered Governor-elect one week after the balloting , by 2,814 votes , with Democrat Clyde Keefe still talking of a recount . <P> In Massachusetts there was still recount talk , although last figures gave Governor Saltonstall 9,000 votes over Democrat Paul A. Dever . <P> In Missouri there was one of the biggest upsets in the State 's political history . For years Lawrence McDaniel , a roly-poly , wisecracking , dependable Democratic wheelhorse , has missed big victories by a hair . Once he was almost mayor of St. Louis . This year he resigned as City Excise Commissioner to run for Governor . Opposing him was Forrest Donnell , an unassuming Republican attorney who had never held public office before . Confident Candidate McDaniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through on schedule , jubilant Candidate McDaniel had a lead of 50,000 on Tuesday night , with 75% of the vote reported . Down it went by morning to 17,000 . By week 's end , Donnell was ahead by 3,698 votes . With 8,000 still to be counted , newspapers hailed Forrest Donnell as Governor-elect . But disappointed Candidate McDaniel said he still had hope . <P> In Kansas , Republican Governor Payne Ratner appeared to be defeated in a State that went Republican , with absentee ballots officially deciding Kansas ' new Governor . Residential voters gave Governor Ratner 416,480 ; Democratic Candidate William H. Burke , 418,359 . But before that 1,879-vote margin made Mr. Burke Governor-elect , some 16,000 absentee ballots remained to be counted . Kansas politicos guessed they would not change the result .
