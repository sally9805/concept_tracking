txt Residents of the administration 's first planned community , the $2,646,000 pet project of Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt which Is now to be sold to its homesteaders for $175,000 , are not agreed that they are getting any bargain even at that great price reduction . Purchasers arc paying prices between $1,000 and $1,500 over a period of 10 years for homesteads that represent an average government outlay of $16,000 each . " Dirt cheap ? Not at all , when you look into it , " declared 0 . C. Brown , one of the now disillusioned men who came here with their families to find homes . Tied Up for 40 Years . " For one thing , the government has strings attached to it for 40 years , during which the homesteader is barred from selling or subleasing the property without written consent of the government . I wo n't be living that long . " That penalizes the homesteaders working outside of the community and there 's no guarantee the people here will have enough income to meet even these payments . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us employment , but they all failed  --  the vacuum cleaners , the shirt factory , cooperative tractors , and the cotton picking machines . " I am working in a plant in Morgantown and have to drive 16 miles there arid " 16 miles back every day . What 's going to happen when my tires wear out ? I 'm prevented from renting this house to some one else and moving in closer to my work for the time being . Others here are faced with the same problem . " A Hal/ Mile of Mud . The white frame house and garden plot where Brown and his wife and three children live is about half a mile down the muddy road from the cluster of Arthurdale 's fancy community buildings  --  the 20 room inn with its good food and tearoomy at , ' mosphere , offices of the Farm Security and National Youth administrations , a craft shop , a community hall , and stores . Arthurdale , t h e administration 's project in " human engineering , " sprang into being in the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's wife has visited Arthurdale frequently and has taken a lively interest in its administration . Homesteaders have vivid memories of being led by her in square dances at the community hall . Village Mirrors Dejection . ? Outwardly the village mirrors the dejection , disillusionment , and bitter . ness voiced by Brown and his neighbors . The houses look dingy and are in need of paint . A belated blizzard has left a blanket of gray snow on the landscape . The dirt roads are quagmires . Here and there a hardworking homesteader has set out hedges , rose bushes , trees , paths , and bird baths . Bitt there are other properties with the stalks of last year 's weeds , bent over under the March wind , on ground that was meant to be lawn or garden . Brown , a sandy haired , stocky . Individual , came out on the side porch and apologized for not asking the visitor inside . He was driving to Morgantown shortly to pick up a friend , a coal miner who had been injured in an accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the new government purchase contract . Ills Heart Was in It . " I helped build Arthurdale and had my heart in it , " Brown said . " But we 've had one failure after another here . A few weeks ago the government told us we had to sign these new contracts , either for the purchase or rental of the home , or get out . We were given only three days to decide . After we do pay up , none of us is sure he really owns his home . " It was not . until a few weeks ago that these people were told they finally would be given a chance to buy their properties . They were shocked by the terms . Brow n and 53 of his neighbors have signed up to buy the dwellings in which they have been living , and their adjoining garden tracts of two to seven acres . The rest of the homesteader s ? signed rental contracts . Some could have signed purchase agreements , but others arc Ineligible because they already owe too much back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are returning to their old jobs in the coal mines and coke plants , which are reopening around the countryside , and others are finding work in defense plants in nearby cities . This , however , results from the war , and not to any specific Washington remedies for Arthurdale 's ills . Nobody knows what will happen to the place after the war . " We all would like to own our homes . like any other American citizens , " Brown said . " All we have is a contract which the government can break any time . What we want is a regular deed , recorded it i the Preston county court . " Brown inveighed against a clause in the contract which he said forces homesteaders to pay the salaries of a lot of political jobholders . Part of each monthly payment goes toward management , which means the people Washington sends here . Mr. Mott Ca n't Talk . The community has had a number of resident managers . The present manager is ' Milford B. Mott , who arrived two months ago after holding various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of Kentucky . Mr. Mott says he is not authorized to give any publicity about the community . Homestead buyers pay little more than $17 a month apiece . Only $3 of this amount goes toward the amortization of their purchase , both prin principal and the 3 per cent interest charge . Some of the homesteaders do n't like it because the government will not permit them to make the purchase outright In less than 10 years . That was one of the complaints of Mrs. J. L. Fullmer , who lives down the road several houses from Brown 's home . Mrs. Fullmer was in the kitchen washing dishes . She came to the back door , drying her hands on her apron . Always Owned Own Rome . z es . we re paying , " seta Mrs. trunrner. " but we 'd like to buy In less than 10 years and then be able to call our house our own afterward . We always owned our own home before and paid all our debts before we came over here . " Mrs. Fullmer is the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a farm near Morgantown because they thought their boys and girls would get a better education . A few doors farther down Mrs. Kent Hartzell said they were buying their house . Did they like it ? " Well , we either have to like it or leave it , " she observed . The Hartzells want more land . Their live stock population is expand . ing . Their Jersey cow had two calves . They have a Bock of 50 white Leghorn chickens and want to buy some pigs later in spring . One homesteader was found who thought the government contract was all right . He was the only one , incidentally to whom Arthurdale offtdais steered the visitor . He was Wil ? Liam , a former coal miner who is employed as janitor for the community buildings . Fifty Dwellings Prefabricated ThehIcNelis family lives in one of the 50 prefabricated dwellings , the first type of building which later gave way to more livable homes . While talked , his wife kneaded bread dough in a pan on the kitchen table . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. . " The fact I signed it shows I do . I believe Arthurdale has a future . To some extent the future of the place depends on what happens to the rest of the country , but It also depends on us people here . " The first house In Arthurdale on the road from the town of Reedsvine , a mile away , is occupied by Harry Robinson and his wife . Robinson , a member of the board of directors of the Arthurdale association which managed the 111-fated enterprises , said he was so disgusted he decided to continue renting instead of signing one of the purchase contracts . Signed in Good Faith . " We came here in good faith from Republic , Pa .. " said Robinson . " The depression caught us . We wanted a home and did n't have enough cash available for the down payment . So we moved to Arthurdale because the government promised us employment and the chance to own our own home . The government fell down on its side of the bargain , " Robinson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefabricated houses did n't fit the faun. dations  --  the walls would be as much as eight feet away from chimneys and fireplaces . He estimated that 115 of the houses would have to be reroofed this year because the shingles , laid carelessly in the first  --  place , were rotting and blowing off .
