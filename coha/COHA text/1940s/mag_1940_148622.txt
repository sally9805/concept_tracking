Returning alone and tired to his Villa Torlonia home one evening some years ago , Benito Mussolini decided on the spur of the moment to go into a cinema . He entered and took a seat , unrecognized . Presently , his own limber face flashed on the screen . Everyone present stood up and applauded , except Il Duce . His secret enjoyment of the demonstration was interrupted by a man behind him who leaned over and whispered : " Better stand up and clap , pal . They 'll arrest you if you do n't . " <P> This incident , which is supposed to have happened early in the days of Il Duce 's power , might easily have taken place again last week . Once more the Dictator was alone and tired . Italians still salaamed to his face on screens , his name on walls , but there were certain new mental reservations in their reverence . Foreign journalists in Rome received anonymous letters : " The Italians desire the end of the dictatorship which renders impossible prosperity and peace . Viva Italia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , in his monstrous office , Il Duce 's heart was not cheered by the reports on the country 's state of mind given him by Chief of Italian Police Arturo Bocchini . Italy 's Himmler-an efficient , honest , courageous , unpublicized bustler who hangs a sign over his desk which says : " Please make it snappy " - daily reported the findings of his intricate wiretapping , eavesdropping machine , and the sum of the findings was not to Il Duce 's taste : Italians want peace . <P> Since the Year One ( of Fascism-1922 ) Benito Mussolini had given his people a martial slogan : " Believe ! Obey ! Fight ! " He hurried from naval reviews to maneuvers at sea , from military exercises to parades to grandiose mock campaigns on land . He learned to salute like Caesar , scowl like Napoleon , wear uniforms like the Kaiser . Of all his Cabinet portfolios , his favorites were those of War , Navy , Air Force . He raised a whole generation of young Italians-among them his own sons - to live dangerously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , esthetic pleasure from the pattern of exploding bombs and the music of gunfire . He told them time &; again that supine neutrality is a cowardice fit only for decadent democracies . <P> He gave Italy an Empire , won in blood , albeit from some poor colored people and a handful of Adriatic hillbillies . He made his countrymen feel that Spain 's victory was Italy 's . He held out the Axis to his people as a double-bladed fasces which would cut a big place in the sun for Italy . <P> By last week Benito Mussolini was a thoroughly disillusioned warrior . The first step in the process of his disappointment was the frenzied joy with which Italians greeted him back from Munich-a far more spontaneous ovation than any military triumph had ever earned him . On the Piazza Venezia balcony that day he made no martial speech , but said only : " You wanted peace . I have brought you peace , " then turned gloomily and went indoors . Next came the German-Russian Pact , which he was not told about until the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes Il Duce may have reposed in his partnership with Adolf Hitler . Worst of all was what happened last autumn .
