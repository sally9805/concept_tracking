txt The united front presented by the principal legislative leaders and Governor Lehman in favor of the $396,000,000 State budget and the proposed $15 , - 000,000 increase in the income tax was broken today by Joe R. Hanley , Senate majority leader . Senator Hanley , summoning reporters to an interview at his home here , said today : " I hope that some way can be evolved so that we will not have to resort to new taxes this year . It is by no means certain that the Legislature will enact any new taxes at the current session . " He denied emphatically that the Republican legislative leaders had entered into an agreement with the Governor to pass the budget and tax program as submitted . " We simply agreed with the Governor that under his estimates for revenue for the next fiscal year this budget was the best that could be worked out , but we never agreed to pass the income tax increase as recommended by him , " he said . He indidated that after the public hearing on Feb. 12 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fiscal year , so that a balanced budget " on paper " could be arrived at without a new tax . He noted that it had been suggested that the income tax increase could be passed , and then repealed next year , prior to its collection , if found to be unnecessary . Higher Revenue Estimates Urged " If we can do that then why ca n't we wait until next year to pass the bill and find out for certain if $15,000,000 is needed to balance the budget ? " he asked . " It might very well be that we would find only $5,000,000 in new taxes was needed to balance the budget . " Personally I am becoming more and more convinced that the Governor should increase his estimates of revenue for the next fiscal year instead of increasing taxes this year . I hope we will be able to persuade the Governor to take such action . " There is considerable legal doubt as to whether the Governor has the legal right to increase his budget estimates once they are submitted . The Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information on which they are based . Presumably , with an increase in estimates , the Governor would also have to change his information . A much more likely prospect for avoiding a new tax at the current session appeared today when David C. Adie , State Welfare Commissioner , announced that home relief costs in December were the lowest in five years , dropping 10 per cent below the level of December , 1938 . The December cost of relief , according to the figures , was $9,934 , - 000 for the entire State , compared with $11,125,000 in December of 1938 . Of this total , the State re- imburies the localities 40 per cent , so that the saving to the State for the month is slightly more than $400,000 . Should this saving be carried through the year , the home relief cost would be cut by about $5,000,000. $82,600,000 Relief in Budget The State budget contains $82 , - 600,000 for relief . Of this sum , $22,600,000 is for debt service on past relief bonds , and this can not be reduced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed that $5,000,000 be made immediately available as a deficiency appropriation for this year , and that $55 , - 000,000 be used as " new money " for the coming year . What the Legislature can do , if it wants to , is to cut this $55,000,000 down to $40,000,000 with the distinct understanding that it will make whatever deficiency appropriation is necessary at the start of the session next year . The $40,000,000 of new money would be sufficient to carry the State through to budgetmaking time next year , even without taking into consideration the reduced spending rate . The principal objection to this plan is that it might make the Republicans appear to be cutting relief appropriations , even though they would , in fact , only be postponing them . They may not want to create any doubt on the subject of relief in a Presidential campaign year . The advantage of the plan is that it would avoid a new tax , or the income tax increase , this year , and would permit amortization of the State 's deficit over a two-year period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year , the remaining $10,000,000 might be made up next year , partly in decreased costs and partly In increased State revenues . Republicans Study Tax System Senator Hanley 's statement today aroused considerable interest and . private comment by other Republicans , who nevertheless declined to make any statements further than they had already made . The attitude on the Assembly side is apparently to wait until the public hearing has been held before attempting to commit the members to any plan . In the meantime , Senator Hanley said that the Republicans were making a careful study of the State 's tax system in an effort to find some revenue that may have been overlooked by the Governor and . Abraham S. Weber , budget director , in preparing the new budget . Senator Hanley is inclined , however , to stand with Governor Lehman in the restoration of full State aid for education and for town and county highways . He said that it was upon his insistence that the Governor included $1,700,000 in the budget for restoration of full State aid for towns and county highways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for education , for town and county highways ; $1,400,000 to restore normal salary increments for State employes and $7,700,000 to cover increased capital outlays had not been included in the budget there would have been no necessity for Mr. Lehman to recommend any tax increase this year . Senator Hanley said he favored restoration of full aid for education because a survey indicated that in about one-third of the school districts real estate taxes were increased to take care of the reduction in aid made by the last Legislature and that in about one-third of the other districts the salaries of teachers were reduced to offset the loss .
