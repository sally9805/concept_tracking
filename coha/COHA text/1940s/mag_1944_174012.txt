There are as many Indians ( 200,000 ) in the South African province of Natal as in the Indian city of Benares . Some 35 years ago Mohandas K. Gandhi , then a fully clothed Natal attorney ( see cut ) , first used passive resistance in defending the Natal Indians against repressive race legislation . <P> South Africa 's Prime Minister Jan Christian Smuts has also tried for years to temper the country 's harsh anti-Indian color laws . The latest of them , which has caused South Africa 's voteless Indians to hum like a swarming hive , is a Natal ordinance dividing the whole province into Jim Crow residential zones . Smuts was in <P> England when this ordinance was passed . <P> The loudest reverberations came from India . Cried Sir Syed Raza Ali , who spent a term in South Africa as India 's Agent-General : " Repressive , offensive , objectionable . " Said Dr. Narayan Bhaskar Khare , member of the Viceroy 's Council in New Delhi : " I wish India was in a position to declare war on South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so , I would have lost no time in taking an army there . " <P> Last week the Government of India imposed residential restrictions on white South Africans living in India ( about 120 people ) . The Indian Central Legislative Assembly resolved to apply economic sanctions , thus threatening South Africa with a jute-bag famine . <P> At week 's end , Prime Minister Smuts was taking long walks on the veld around his farm near Pretoria . For him the question was whether to veto Natal 's ordinance by an Act of Parliament and rock his Government , or let the ordinance stand and perhaps rock the Empire .
