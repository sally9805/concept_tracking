Americans the spring of 1942 , emphasizing that " you Americans can do anything , " Prime Minister Winston Churchill asked us to invent a com-pletely new vehicle to support a daring , desperate invasion of Norway . High on the list of objectives was destruction of Norwegian power plants , including those already being used for preparation of heavy water for German experiments on an atomic bomb . The basis of this invasion was to be the new vehicle . It had to be small enough to be carried by an airplane , light enough to be dropped safely by parachutes , and powerful enough to carry a 1200-pound load . It had to be able to travel at least twenty-five miles an hour and climb a forty-five-degree slope in soft snow , cross bare rock and railroad tracks , get through spring freshets , maneuver through forests like a weasel and have a guaranteed life of at least 1000 miles . Churchill asked us not only to invent and produce this new machine six times as fast as the American automotive industry would normally require for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special task force to use it in the vanguard of the attack . No other secret weapon , not even radar or , at the time , the atomic bomb , had a higher priority . The task force was organized from hand-picked volunteers and became the 1st Special Service Force , Lt. Col. ? now Major General  --  Bob Frederick 's famous " Black Devils , " known throughout the services as the " bow-and-arrow boys . " And the vehicle was invented and produced . Known today as the weasel , it can travel over hard roads , turf , mud , soft sand , plowed fields , swamps , rice paddies , rivers , lakes , soft snow and bare ice . If you can find the place on the map , the weasel can get there . The birth of this omnibious machine was not altogether painless . Before the first of some 12,000 weasels came clattering off the production lines , Churchill , Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten , General Marshall , Secretary of War Stimson , Lieutenant Colonel Frederick , Harry Hopkins and Dr. Vannevar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development , were all but convinced that the weasel was a low and vicious beast which should be destroyed before it completely demolished Anglo-American relations . Complaints came through diplomatic channels that the weasel project was being distressingly mishandled by certain American generals and civilians , that these certain persons were quite obnoxious , and that something should be done about this situation forthwith . If a slightly more calm and dispassionate environment surrounded the technical development , the difference was scarcely noticeable . Dignified professors were whisked out of their laboratories and classrooms , placed on waiting airplanes and deposited in meetings . Expeditions were dispatched all over North and South America . Special highly guarded test grounds had to be laid out in the Canadian Rockies and a special air shuttle service had to be established to supply it . Tens of thousands of feet of moving-picture film were taken at the test grounds , flown to Toronto , developed in special laboratories and then flown back to the Rockies for showing forty-eight hours later . Automobile engineers , who had once boasted that they could unflinchingly face any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when OSRD scientists and Army officers visited their plants . Many hundreds of experts on snow were rounded up for questioning  --  arctic and antarctic explorers , meteorologists , physicists , engineers and sportsmen . Every vehicle which had ever been built to travel on snow was investigated . For  --  and this was the biggest problem of all  --  with the weasel to be developed primarily as a snow machine , at the start nobody knew quite enough about the physical fundamentals of snow , the weight it would support or the best type of vehicle to use on it . The demand for the weasel was issued when Geoffrey Pyke , a British writer and psychologist , convinced Lord Louis Mountbatten , who convinced Churchill , who then convinced General Marshal ! , that the sudden airborne invasion should be staged soon after Christmas of 1942 , when Norway would be covered by snow and ice , and the Germans would neither expect a large-scale , fast-moving attack nor be able to stop it . On a Friday morning in a small office in the Pentagon Building in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined by the Prime Minister 's mission  --  Brig . Nigel Duncan , Major E. A. W. Wedderburn , of the British Commandos , and Pyke , Listening were Brig . Gen. Raymond G. Moses , the War Department G-4 and Assistant Chief of Staff to General Marshall ; Col. Earl Hoag , of the General Staff , and executive officer to General Moses ; Doctor Bush ; Hartley Rowe , chief engineer of the United Fruit Company and chief of Division 12 of the National Defense Research Committee  --  a division of OSRD  --  and Palmer Cosslett Putnam , Rowe 's head technical aide . Putnam was the man who was already calling the signals on OSRD 's other secret vehicle , the General Motors " duck , " A Job That Surely Called for Short Cuts T O this group the British delegation gave the broad general specifications for the weasel , and stipulated that delivery of the first 600 vehicles must begin within 180 days . General Moses turned to the OSRD men . " Weil , " he asked , " what do you think ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Putnam . " What do you think , Put ? " they asked . " You 'll have to do it . " " I 'm not sure , " said Putnam . " After all , you have to realise that the actual production of this vehicle must be done by an automobile manufacturer , and that in the automobile industry the average length of time to get out -- say , even a new chassis  --  is about twelve months from drawing board to consumer . Now you want us to design not one component , but a whole vehicle . Furthermore , even in the automobile industry , it takes about a hundred and forty days to tool up for production . You want us to design a snow vehicle , and find snow fields in the middle of summer to test it , and then tool up and produce , all in one hundred and eighty days . " Pyke interrupted , " Then , Mr. Putnam , you do n't believe you can do it ? " " I did n't say that , " Putnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timing is to be met , some fantastic short cuts must be taken . " " What have you in mind ? " asked Moses . " Plenty , " said Putnam , and listed the following demands : the highest priority , so that the basic design could be frozen in seven to ten days ; duplicate designing , tooling and manufacture of at least some components , with the understanding that perhaps less than half of these then priceless tools and metals would be used , and the rest junked after tests ; repossession of steel and machine tools already allocated to other manufacturers ; the full services of the Army and of the State Department in finding accessible snow fields in July and August ; the services of Colonel Sverre Petterssen , a former professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , then on leave from the Norwegian Army as the top weather forecaster for the RAF in London , and the man who was pushing the buttons for the RAF raids over Germany ; and the services  --  recommended by Pyke  --  of Herman Mark , former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on snow and avalanches in the Tyrol , then in Brooklyn as an enemy alien . " Enemy alien  --  fine ! " said Moses . " All right , we 'll get them  --  and the other things . So far , you 've started fights with the WPB , the State Department , the RAF and the FBI . Anything else ? " " Yes , " Putnam replied . " I think we should collect every kind of snow vehicle that we can find in North America and get them all on to the last patch of dry snow , wherever that may be , within the next few days . As a starter , I think I should leave with Major Wedderburn for the Army 's winter-warfare camp at Mount Rainier this afternoon , " That Friday afternoon , after studying the massive review already . THE SATURDAY Studebaker , to help design and engineer the weasel . Presented with the urgency of the assignment. , Cole agreed to take the job . It was decided immediately that Goodrich and Firestone should be invited to work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Putnam , " let 's get them into this right now . Let 's have their engineers ? " " Just a minute , " said Cole . " Today is Sunday . We may have trouble in finding them . " A moment later he was on the telephone talking to a startled sergeant of the Ohio State Police and asking that the top engineers of Goodrich and Firestone be found , wherever they were , picked up and brought at once to the Akron airport . Two hours later , Major Wedderburn , Colonel Hoag and Putnam landed at Akron , introduced themselves to the waiting and somewhat puzzled rubber engineers , and went into conference . Studebaker soon discovered that there was a real similarity between the mechanical weasel and its four-legged namesake , which is a slinking , dangerous , crafty animal that wo n't fight fair . " We used to come out at night and look at those machines sitting on the shop floor , " one of the Studebaker men said , " and the damned things would actually leer at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Studebaker agreed to take on the project . On Monday preliminary studies and layouts were started ; on Wednesday these layouts were checked and preliminary specifications were approved ; on Thursday the engine , transmission , front drive and other standard items were released for production , and experimental orders were placed for the first four pilot models . " That , " said E. M. Douglas , executive engineer of Studebaker , " was a week . Those OSRD men not only did n't want us to sleep , they did n't even want us to sit down . " But on Friday of that first nightmarish week , Studebaker 's body-engineering department began a full-sized draft of the hull and body . On Sunday the first drawings were yanked from the boards and rushed to the sheet-metal department . The first body began to take shape . Similar hell was popping simultaneously at Goodrich and Firestone , where the two companies were off on a race to invent and build the rubber track for the weasel . Here was one of the duplicate jobs which OSRD had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realization that only one design would be accepted and the rest of the priceless rubber would be junked . On Monday , May twenty-fifth , another parallel job began at Studebaker when OSRD approved a shorter , more compact model suggested by the automotive engineers . While Studebaker 's engineers were ramming the weasel job through on a twenty-four-hour schedule  --  OSRD 's Bush had given it priority as one of the hottest secret weapons in America and had approved spending as much as S100,000 apiece on the first four test models  --  the OSRD men opened their search for summer snow . It was coming on to June , however , and the snow that remained in this country could have been put in your eye . It was agreed , therefore , to send an expedition to Alaska , and on May thirtieth , the members of this OSRDArmy expedition took off with brief cases full of credentials . They were preceded by other authorizations sent directly from the War Department to EVENING POST the late Lieutenant General Buckner , then head of the Alaska Defense Command , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anchorage , the explorers telephoned General Buckner with the idea of paying respects , picking up equipment and getting on with the job . General Buckner would be delighted with the respects , they discovered , but knew nothing about the equipment or the job . The men thereupon went to the general 's headquarters and presented their duplicate credentials in person . Buckner looked at the papers . " Of course , " he said , " we 'll take care of you , but we 're likely to have the Japs on our hands at any moment . Don't. you think you could find better snow conditions elsewhere  --  say , in South America ? " However , after a conference lasting until 1:30 in the morning , arrangements were completed for getting the expedition on its way  --  and preferably out of Alaska in a hurry  --  and the men went back to their hotel . Before dawn , they left on a 3000-mile tour of Alaska 's highly touted summer snow fields . " What we wanted , " said Putnam , " was deep powder snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached and used for the weasel tests . " How do you find deep powder snow from the air ? Easy  --  you fly over it and look for wind blowing the snow along the ground . If there 's no wind , you fly a lot lower and try to loosen the snow with the wash of your propellers and at the same time try to avoid hitting incidental rocks , trees , canyons and mountains . After forty-four hours of inspecting the Wrangel Range , the Mt . Kimball Range , the unexplored Endicotts , the glaciers north and east of Mt . McKinley and the glaciers northwest of Valdez , the men returned to Anchorage without having found a trace of powder snow in a terrain that was suitable for a proving ground . Their ship landed at 2:30 in the morning . Less than four hours later , the Japs bombed Dutch Harbor . Six hours after that , the Japs came back to see if they 'd left anything . At ten o'clock that night an air-raid warning screeched over Anchorage . At . eleven o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , after General Buckner had told them , ? " You 're welcome to stay as our guests as long as you wish , but we can't. give you any more help ; we 're in the middle of a fight , " they rode out to Anchorage 's Elmendorf Field and reluctantly took off for the United States . " The Army gave us every assistance in departing , " they reported . Two days later , the Japs landed on Kiska in the Aleutians . Meanwhile , back in the United States , Geoffrey Pyke continued to offer his full assistance on the weasel project . He urged that the weasel be designed so it could leap sideways and thus be able to elude enemy dive bombers . He perfected his plans for the Norwegian campaign . He proposed a study of the average number of trees in a Norwegian forest . He telephoned General Marshall at three o'clock one morning to suggest the immediate development of emergency air fields made of ice and located in the North Atlantic . None of these proposals , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States War Department and OSRD . At Studebaker , day-and-night work was having its effect . The first two pilot models were finished on June twentieth , the second two on July third . The 47 Then the snow conditions on the glacier improved and the weasel began to co-operate . On the five-mile test course , hour after hour , day and night , it breezed along in a cloud of snow , ice and gasoline fumes . It huffed and sputtered and clattered up the fortyfive-degree , snow-covered flanks of Mt . Castleguard , 8500 feet above sea level . Most : of the time it kept its tracks on , As each change in design improved its performance , the details of I he change were telephoned to South Bend and the necessary modifications were made . While the engineers were trying all their threats and wiles on the weasel , another group of workers was studying snow  --  measuring its weight , its water content , its strength and its changing characteristics under every climatic condition . Petterssen , the Norwegian , slaved over his records and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or days ahead . It would be his job to tell the task force , " Tomorrow you can not invade Norway , for the snow will be soft and enemy skiers can catch you , " or " Tomorrow you can invade ; your weasels will be able to give you at least twenty-two miles per hour on the level snow and you can elude enemy ski patrols . " Overseeing the whole job under Hartley Rowe 's direction was Putnam , cursing with the engineers , measuring with the scientists , expediting with the Army and even rushing off to rescue poor Herman Mark , the enemy-alien snow expert  --  now an American citizen  --  who was grabbed by the immigration authorities every time he tried to cross the border . " For heaven 's sake , Put , " the Army bosses said , " get . rid of that guy . This project is secret. ! We ca n't have any Germans on this job ! " " Ca n't do it , " said Putnam . " Mark is invaluable . He 's our textbook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret enough . " Too many people keep hearing about the weasel , " they said . " The Signal Corps hears , and they want us to put on a big radio . Somebody in Ordnance wants us to add steel armor . Somebody else wants us to put on guns . Now lookit this . They want us to add two hundred pounds of TNT ! What are we building , a battleship ? " Finally on October 14 , 15 and 16 , 1942 , before a galaxy of top-ranking American and British officers , the weasel showed its stuff , competing against every other snow vehicle that could be assembled . Many times a weasel was sent out to rescue one of its competitors which had been stalled in a snowdrift . In a tactical teat , a whole pack of weasels was used in a mock-invasion maneuver : the invaders raced across the snow , blew up Quonset huts temporarily posing as Norwegian power plants and then roared hack to their rendezvous , pursued by an " enemy " ski battalion . The skiers , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slope , but they had no chance to catch the invaders , who finally turned around , picked up the exhausted " enemy " and brought them back to headquarters for hot coffee . The weasel was good , and it proved it up on the Columbia Ice Fields . Right I hen anti there , you could get odds of 10 to 1 that the weasel would carry General Frederick 's Black Devils straight I hrough Norway to Berlin . The weasel was in . And then the weasel was out ! Behind sealed doors , the Combined Chiefs of Staff changed their minds . Another method  --  fifth-column sabotage  --  bad been selected to destroy the Norwegian power plants . Norway was crossed off and North Africa was written in ; North Africa , and then maybe Italy  --  which meant sand and mud . What could the weasel do in sand and mud ? Well , what could it do ? A little mad now , remembering the weeks and months - of constant rush , the Studebaker and OSRD men went back to work . They redesigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trying still new tricks on the tracks , which still occasionally insisted on flying off . They added a false bow and stern to increase the weasel 's buoyancy , and applied special housings around the upper part of the track , so the snow vehicle could not merely ford shallow streams but actually navigate in deep water . All winter they worked on these improvements , checking the results in sand pits and mudholes near South Bend . Then they sent their new weasels down to Louisiana , where the Army claimed they had some swamps that were real swamps . They had swamps , sure enough , and the new weasels went right through them . A general heard about the weasels and borrowed them to try out in maneuvers through the Louisiana bayous . Later he was criticized for using them to solve problems which , by all the rules of war , could not be solved . The new weasel soon went to work in Italy , carrying men and supplies through snow and mud up to the line , bringing hack wounded , laying wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't go . It went ashore on Normandy , clattering back and forth across the beaches by the hundreds , and through France , Belgium and Germany  --  through sand , mud , water and snow . It performed miracles in the breakthrough at St. L ? , the Battle of the Bulge in the snowy Ardennes and in the mud of the Boer and the Rhine . The Marines and the Army took the weasel with them to Iwo Jima , where for four days the soft volcanic dust immobilized every other vehicle , and to Leyte and Okinawa . Many a wounded soldier and marine is alive today because the medics came and got him in a weasel over swamps or mud or quicksand or soggy paddy fields where no jeep or truck or ambulance could travel , where not even a pair of stretcher bearers could get through . Many an aviator came back to fly again because a weasel patrolling the air lines in Northern Canada , Alaska or Greenland came out to get him on the snow or packed ice or unfrozen slush . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulled up to a stop , climbed out and kissed their mud or snow covered tracks . On Okinawa one day , an Army captain was notified that his shipment of weasels was waiting for him on the beach . He called over to his sergeant . " Look , " he said , " go get six trucks and go down to the beach . Pick up those weasels . Put ' em on the trucks . Carry ' em back . If you drive those things before you get ' em here , murder you . I do n't know how many miles those weasels are good for , but every blasted foot is going to belong to me ! "
