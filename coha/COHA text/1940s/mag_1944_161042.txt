The Army &; Navy can now prevent measles epidemics with a blood substance called gamma globulin . Last week this news spotlighted Harvard Medical School 's unique Department of Physical Chemistry , where gamma-globulin extraction was perfected . <P> Gamma globulin is a blood protein . The solution the Army &; Navy use is made from donations to the Red Cross blood bank . In tests it has prevented attacks of measles entirely or made them mild . One obvious use for gamma globulin : to prevent measles in children under two , for whom the disease is very dangerous . <P> Dr. Edwin Joseph Cohn , 51 , has headed Harvard 's Department of Physical Chemistry since it began ( 1920 ) . He refuses to talk about himself , talks about his laboratory only in scientific journals in abstruse articles on the devious ways of blood . From the beginning , the laboratory 's work has been too deep for most laymen , as near pure science as work on flesh &; blood can be . In 1940 the National Research Council picked Dr. Cohn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wartime transfusions . So far the answer is no , but in turning beef blood inside out , techniques were developed which led to the new ways of mining human blood for its useful components . <P> Since the war began , backed chiefly by the Navy , this busy laboratory has perfected the extraction of : <P> A stable preparation of serum albumin ( TIME , Jan. 31 ) , which is especially useful in shock . It is five times as powerful as plasma in drawing blood fluid back from the tissues into the blood stream . ( Leakage of blood fluid into the tissues , with consequent reduction of blood volume and lowered blood pressure , are characteristics of shock . ) <P> Fibrin film , fibrin foam and thrombin ( TIME , March 20 ) . Fibrin film is used as a substitute for brain covering ; fibrin foam and thrombin stop oozing blood . <P> Blood grouping globulins ( also called isohemagglutinins ) for use in blood typing . There are two kinds , one which reacts with type A blood , one with type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs a transfusion of whole blood . <P> Seven commercial houses under Navy contract use Dr. Cohn 's methods to extract serum albumin and other blood components . Since Dr. Cohn 's laboratory does war work , the outside door is locked , the number of white-garbed assistants secret . So is most of the work being done within .
