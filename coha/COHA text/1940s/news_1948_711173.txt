txt America 's airports , which have been dependable as clockwork at losing money . are finally learning how to pick up some loose change . They 're doing it by shifting their attention from the sky to the ground . Instead of relying mostly on aircraft landing fees and airline rentals , they are collecting cash from a multitude of ground concessions  --  which are transforming them into shopping and entertainment centers . Classed as customers are not only plane passengers . but airfield visitors and even the airport workers . They are yielding coin to parking meters. drug stores , vending machines , swimming pools , photo shops . At the Wichita airport you can rent an auto . Tha swank Cloud Room and coffee shop at the Chicago municipal airport , opened less than a month ago by Marshall Field Ss Co .. are serving 7.000 " very profitable- customers a day The evangelist of the modern airport talks more like a real estate man than an aviator .

Curtiss. director of concessions and revenue for the Port of New York Authority , which has taken over the giant air facilities for the nation 's biggest city , waxes enthusiastic over a vending machine he says is earning at an annual rate of $174 a square foot . LaGuardia Field now has 69 machines selling nylon hosiery , toothbrushes , photographs , candy , nuts . soft drinks and popcorn . Richard G. Appel , Jr .. assistant manager of Boston 's Logan International Airport , points fondly to a news stand earning $14 a square foot yearly . And across the continent B. M. Doolin , manager of the San Francisco Airport , is looking forward to $20,000 of parking lot revenues this year . The more fantastic developments of this sort are still on paper . Mr. Doolin Is dresyning ot the " city unto itself " which is supposed to be finished in 1950 as the culmination of his airport 's current expansion program .

The trend extends to smaller air centers . For example , the manager of the Cedar Rapids , Iowa , municipal airport , 29-year-old Frank Hidinger , has drawn up plans that include shops of all kinds and an outdoor theatre . Special Language Strategy of this sort is already helping many an airport become " self-supporting " ? putting it " in the black . " But one word of warning . Phrases such as these often seem to have a special meaning when used by airport executives . As one leading authority on airport financing says . many of the fields ignore amortization , depreciation and interest charges . A port that 's covering its operating expenses is likely to consider itself " out of the red. - And sometimes even this accounting fails to include services such as snow removal performed by municipal or other governmental agencies . This was reflected at a recent session of the American Association of Airport Executives in Chicago . where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather typical ports represented have become s ? llsupporting President Neil Brackstone , or Lansing , Mich. , rightly claimed " great strides. - Yet nearly all these 22 are merely meeting their operating costs . not their tots , costs . The International City Managers ' Association will soon publish a survey showing that " the number of airports currently operating in the black has increased substantially over a year ago . " Again , it 's a matter of operating costs . , .11% Apparently few people expect ordtnaty business accounting procedures to be applied to airport financing . The federal government appropriated $48.9 million last year as s . early instalment on a half-billion-dollar airport development program to which states and cities are supposed to contribute as much again Enthusiasm is not flagging . The Aeronautics Administration calculates tbe Ile. - tion had 4,921 non-military airfields on March 1 , which is 829 more than a year ago .

The toughest ones to convince that airports can pay for themselves , Mr. Fisher comments , are the old-timers in aviation . " Many of theca were once barnstorming pilots who still think of an airport as a flat piece of land on which planes take off and land . " It 's still that , but much more . Also alert are men like Louis Leverone , president of Automatic Canteen Co. of America . His sales story is that airports still are n't taking full advantage of the possibilities of vending machines . He says s. full complement of the dispeners would take care of 10% to 15% of most ports ' operating costs . At a recent gathering of the Airport Operators Council in Boston , field managers from scattered cities showed him they were ready to learn : they devoted most of a closed discussion meeting to bombarding him with questions about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling of non-flight activities . First , they are increasingly inclined to have a. single concessionaire handle all the business in his particular field . Second . they are more and more minded to lease space on a percentage basis rather than a flat rental . Short-term leases with cancellation clauses are becoming increasingly popular . Too many airports have seen airport crowds jump to unexpected volume while rentals were fixed at slowbusiness levels . He Glowers at the Clocks A sharp eye for a dollar has proved just as important as grandiose expansion plans . Boston 's Mr. Appel glowers when he looks at the clocks installed in his air terminal by an earlier management . Installed by a well-known manufacturer , " they could be worth several thousand dollars a year to us. " he grumbles , " but they were put in under long-term contract , and we do n't get a cent for them . " He thinks they should draw advertising revenue .

New York 's Mr. Curtiss prides himself on persuading businessmen to take on apparently impossible concession locations to their ultimate advantage . He says a reluctant photographer he placed under the rotunda stairs next to the ladies room is doing a handsome business recording visiting South Americans for posterity . The aircraft activities of a busy field are so natural a magnet for rubbernecks that many a port has long charged a small fee for the right to gaze . But standard practice can be lifted into business art : the take at LaGuardia Field 's observation deck jumped $10.000 last summer when a public address system was installed to explain what was going on . The port 's revenue rose another $8,000 when a concessionaire was persuaded to send hawkers of ice cream sucks out along the simmering deck . The consumer market at airports is ; . - , To ? ing .

Manager John Casey estimates the running time will be halved when the city realizes plans to fill in an abandoned canal and build a high-speed road from the loop to join a six-lane highway on the outskirts of town .
