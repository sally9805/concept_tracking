EXPERIMENT-Helen Hull-Coward , McCann ( $2.50 ) . <P> This book consists of four short novels . <P> 1 ) In With the One Coin for Fee two aging women , girlhood friends , meet after many years as 1938 's New England hurricane blows up . One is at the end of a sexually avid and shameless career ; the other is a spinster who jealously despises her . They die in the hurricane , reconciled . <P> 2 ) In Food for Thought an indigent young professor , almost parted from his wife , his sons , his frowsy household , by a first flirtatious glimpse of suburban high life , is cured because he has a bad time at a high life dinner . <P> 3 ) In Snow in Summer a Michigan dentist 's wife wins a prize for a novel , goes in innocence to Manhattan , suffers cruel treatment at the hands of literary racketeers , returns to find her once secure family at the brink of disruption . <P> 4 ) In Experiment the brief return home of a young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his relatives some into sad , some into bitter reflection upon the three frustrate generations it took to produce him . <P> Taken as wholes , each of these stories is almost as warm , as living , as persuasive , as if a first-rate writer had written them . But they have a woman-magazine-overtone , a sort of moral odor of Ivory Soap which gets oppressive . Thus tuned for housewives , the high quotient of safe-and-sane marriages , superior wives , is notable .
