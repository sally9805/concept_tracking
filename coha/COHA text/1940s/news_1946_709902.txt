txt In the housing shortage for veterans we have also been laboring under a shortage of dependable facts . This has been somewhat alleviated now by the release of results of a survey made in July by the Census Bureau at the request of the National Housing Agency . Of the 765,000 Second World War veterans living in the New York City area in July as many as 116 per cent were married . What could these married veterans afford to pay for housing ? It is the answer to this question that must raise grave doubts of the direction that visible housing activity in the New York area seems to be taking . Veterans who would buy or build homes , if they could find what they want , could afford on the average to pay only $6,700 , but one-fourth of the veterans could pay only $5,600 or less . They would , of course , be making their purchases largely on a monthly basis , and the prospective home-owners figured that they could afford monthly payments of not more , on the average , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire insurance , heat , light and cooking fuel . But one-fourth of these veterans who hoped to own a house could pay only $52 or less . Even if we assume that the veterans who would like to buy " or build houses could afford the outlay they estimate per month , in view of the , high price they must pay now for the other elements that go into the setting up of an independent household it must be clear that the prospect for these veterans owning their own home in the New York City area is dismal indeed . A new five-room house in Westchester is more likely to cost $12,000 to $15,000 than $5,000 , and the taxes , insurance , maintenance costs , heat , light , water and other charges that go into living in it combine to put home ownership for the average veteran far out of reach . If the Government wants to see veterans housed at a monthly rate they can afford it should devote its policies in the New York area almost entirely to encouraging large-scale building of new apartment house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained at all , on the cost of individual homes for which materials can legally be used should be raised  --  with the aim not of producing new homes that veterans could afford to buy , but to restore something like free enterprise in home building . The result , under present conditions , would be many more modI ern homes built , a movement into these homes of high-income families , and the vacating of their former homes . These vacated homes then go on the market for the veteran to buy , or are available for remodeling into small apartments for the veteran to rent . We have proceeded too largely on the assumption that the only tenable aim of the building program should be a newly constructed home for the veteran . The wiser policy is a building program , as nearly free of restriction as it can be made , that frees for the veterans ' use the largest number of dwelling units , old or new .                    @
