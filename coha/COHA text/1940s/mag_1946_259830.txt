George Strausser Messersmith was U.S. consul general in Berlin when Hermann Goring paid him a call one day . Hitler 's No. 2 man was in his usual arrogant mood . He swept his hand over a map of South America . There was one of Germany 's spheres of influence , he boasted , and began pounding the table . Messersmith stopped him . " This is my house , " Messersmith said coldly . " No one pounds the table here but me . If there is any pounding done , I will do it . " <P> This is the man whom the State Department chose last week to run the U.S. Embassy in Argentina , a job which has been vacant since bull-necked Spruille Braden was called back to Washington last August to become Assistant Secretary in charge of Latin American affairs . <P> Some Argentines will remember Messersmith-he was consul general in Buenos Aires in 1928 . They will remember a stubby man with a cocky gait , invariably armed with a cane and wearing a flower in the buttonhole of his well-draped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his unbending ways and a cold manner punctuated by discreet belches ; he is dyspeptic . <P> Braden 's Man . A onetime Delaware schoolteacher , George Messersmith has been in the diplomatic service 32 years-he had served in Canada , the Dutch West Indies , Belgium and Luxembourg before he went to Berlin . According to a colleague , he has " an uncanny nose that can smell an s.o.b . as far as the wind can carry the scent . " He got the scent in Berlin almost immediately . In 1933 he wrote to Washington : " There is a real revolution here , and a dangerous situation . " He was home , serving as Assistant Secretary of State , when the situation cracked in September 1939 . <P> For the last five years he has been a conscientious Ambassador to Mexico . Although he was sometimes tactless , Mexican officials approved of him . <P> In Argentina , Peronistas hailed his appointment as a defeat for Braden and a sign that the U.S. now intends to conduct its Argentine business on a strictly professional basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. policy . Messersmith is Braden 's man . And Peron might remember Messersmith 's " uncanny nose . " <P> In another shuffle of its South American representatives , the State Department switched 49-year-old William Douglas Pawley from Peru to Brazil , to fill the spot recently vacated by Adolf Berle Jr . Swashbuckling Bill Pawley* began a fabulous , up- &-down; career at 18 by selling diving suits to Venezuela pearl divers , more recently helped organize the famous Flying Tigers . He once modestly remarked : " Unquestionably I have been one of the prime contributors to China 's defense . " As Ambassador to Peru he earned the respect and awe of the Bustamante Government . He , too , was the personal choice of Spruille Braden . <P> * Not to be confused with Oilman Ed Pauley.
