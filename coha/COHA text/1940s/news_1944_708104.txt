txt Governor Dewey headed homeward tonight , with his transcontinental tour ended so far as speech-making is concerned . In an extemporaneous address at Tulsa this afternoon the Republican candidate promised to clean out of office in Washington all Communists , charging that President Roosevelt had pardoned Earl Browder , their leader , so that he could take part in the current campaign . Mr. Browder was convicted of perjury in connection with illegal use of a passport several years ago . Mr. Dewey told a crowd of more than 10,000 at the Tulsa railroad station that he would also get rid of the " elegant collections of loafers " contributed to the public payroll by the Kelly machine in Chicago , the Pendergast machine in Kansas City and the Hague machine in Jersey City . Repeating much of his speech in Oklahoma City last night , the Governor again charged the President with seeking to undermine the country 's unity , and trying to stir one group against another . Mr. Dewey , who was introduced by Senator Moore , Republican , of Oklahoma , told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be here today and continue with you the task of bringing to our Government an administration which will not , from the day the President takes his oath of office until the end of his term , ever use his office to divide one part of the American people from another . Wo n't Undermine Unity " After Jan. 20 , your President will never speak to one group for the purpose of inciting them to dislike , hatred or distrust of another group of fellow-Americans . " After Jan. 20 , your President will never seek to undermine the Unity of this country for his political purposes either in war or in peace time . " It will be our sole purpose to speed the winning of the war and the greatest possible victory over Germany and Japan . It will then ' be our purpose to promote and keep the unity of all our people in a program whereby we can work with all the other peace-loving na-1 tions in the world to see that this holocaust of war does not descend Upon us again . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that for those seven dreary years from 1933 to 1940 we had handouts . We had unprecedented government deficits . We had political propaganda . We had legislation . We had pomp and circumstance , but we never got jobs . " By the year 1940 when the New Deal was seven years old , and its whiskers were growing very gray , we still had 10,000,000 Americans unemployed , and I do n't want to go back to that kind of an America at the end of this war . West Only Started to Grow " It is my purpose in this cam-1 paign to bring a government to our people which , first of all , will set its face in the future and will not for any purpose stand gazing at the past either in sorrow or at.1 admiring its splendor . " We need an administration which is looking forward in this country . I have for the last three weeks traveled through the western half of the States , and I say to you the western half of these United States has only started in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " My opponent founded his administration twelve sad years ago with the statement that our industrial plant is all built . that there is nothing left for us to do but squabble over what we have , and that is what has been going on now for twelve long years . " I say that our industrial plant is not built . I say that our frontiers have not been discovered . I say they have not even yet been heard of , and when we get an administration which believes in the future of this country , which believes that we have places to go , which believes that we have infinite possibilities for a technical expansion , agricultural expansion , for every form of improvement in our standards of living , which believes invention is absolutely unlimited in the future , then we can start going places again . " The second thing I want to do , it is something in which I have ' had a little personal experience . I should like on Jan. 20 , or as soon I thereafter as the needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a large number of field offices in the forty-eight States , the largest and best house cleaning that anybody ever did . " I should like to clean house on ! those political satellites which have fastened themselves on your pock-I etbooks and mine for twelve years . ) I should like to get rid of the wasters . I should like to get rid of that crew to whom my opponent is so indispensable . " We should start , of course , with Harold Ickes and Madame Perkins and then we would go through with the elegant collection of loafers contributed to the Government by the Kelly machine in Chicago and your neighboring Pendergast machine in Kansas City , and those destroyers of civil liberty on the Federal payroll from Jersey City , and then we would go through the Sidney Hillman crew of the PAC and , finally , or perhaps first of all , clean out those who hold their office and whose political and philosophical affiliations are with the gentleman whom my opponent had to pardon so he could wage this campaign , Mr. Browder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restore in Washington , on Jan. 20 , a Government which does never promise one thing and gives you the opposite . We shall restore the Government of the United States in the position of the hearts and minds of its people so they know its spoken word can be trusted and believed . " We shall believe honestly in our Government . intellectually , morally and every other way , and with that as a beginning we can then go forward and do those things that are so necessary . We can start rewriting the laws so men may know what they may do . We shall start rewriting the laws so that men may know that they are going to work , that they can create business , that little business can thrive and prosper without the tentacles of Washington choking them slowly to death . " We shall revise the tax system so offensive to our people and we shall restore an attitude in the point of view of our Government which says that we believe in the American people . We shall go forward . We want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the sun , and we want every man with an idea that he can make a job and go ahead and make it . " We want all our men to come back here to a free America . We want a free people . We do n't want to regulate their lives , but to go I ahead and bring forth richer and better life which is the birthright of every American . "
