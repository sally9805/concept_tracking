James Sloan , 42 , male , 225 W. 110 Street , apartment 42 . Date-October 28 , 1940 , 11:15 p.m . Place of Occurrence-33rd Street and Seventh Avenue , Pennsylvania Railroad Station . Nature of illness-Contusion of lower abdomen . Home . <P> Was attended by Dr. Mascitelli , of St.Vincent 's Hospital , for injuries received while on duty . Was kicked by one Stephen Early , secretary of President , U. S. <P> So ran the police report last week on Steve Early 's greatest mistake . Of all the reports , it alone was terse . <P> For seven years Washington correspondents have noted and written much of Secretary Early 's blunders . An imposing , hot-tempered , red-faced Virginian ( distant kinsman of Confederate General Jubal A. Early ) , a onetime newspaperman himself , and President Roosevelt 's press secretary since 1933 , he has also been the White House spokesman . Once he delivered what sounded like a Presidential rebuke to Henry Wallace for urging the Third Term . Once he relayed the President 's views on the Monroe Doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorials or his own cryptic statements later could clear them up . But none of these compared with his act last week . <P> President Roosevelt had topped a day of New York barnstorming with his Madison Square Garden speech . Down to Pennsylvania Station hurried the Presidential party . President Roosevelt was taken to the train level by a freight elevator . Some 40 newsmen and photographers , held up at the station door , were rescued and passed through police lines by Secret Service operators . Steve Early got through one police line by showing his credentials with their engraved golden Presidential eagle . Before he could get to the train itself he was stopped by a police sergeant , flanked by one Irish and one Negro cop . They were under orders , once the President got aboard , to let no one approach the train . <P> Vainly Steve Early argued , hauled out his Secret Service commission . Vainly he tried to push past the bluecoats , was pushed back in plain sight of 35 waiting newsmen , between Secretary of Treasury Henry Mogenthau and Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cops . Steve Early jerked up his knee into the Negro policeman 's groin . Then , while an ambulance was called for the policeman , Mr. Early went back upstairs , called Secret Service men , who took the party to the train . <P> The Negro policeman whom Steve Early kneed was the father of five children . He had been cited for bravery . He had returned to duty three months before , after an operation for hernia . And when the incident occurred , no one knew which way the Negro vote would go . Manhattan newspapers published guarded interviews* with Patrolman Sloan , invalided to bed , in which he said that he had been kicked , that he felt terrible , and that he had been ordered not to talk . In Washington Steve Early denied that he had kicked a cop , admitted he had " given him the knee . " Harlem 's New York Age headlined : " Secretary of Pres. Roosevelt Kicks N. Y. Negro Policeman . " New York 's Police Commissioner Valentine ordered an investigation . So did District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and denunciations began to blister in the press . Somebody remembered that Steve Early had written a Saturday Evening Post article last year on the unfair attacks on President Roosevelt . Its title : " Below the Belt . "
