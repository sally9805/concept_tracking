London 's Financial Times gloomed , " soaking the rich again . " But in fact Brit ain 's first full peacetime budget , slanted slightly socialist , offered everybody a little something , sent industrial shares up a respectable 1% and Government securities to ten-year highs . <P> Labor 's shy Chancellor of the Exchequer , Hugh Dalton , was happy about it . <P> For long months he had wrestled with the dilemma of controlling inflation with high taxes , spurring production with low taxes . <P> Every figure he set down depended on whether the U.S. loan would come through . But now he was sure he had the answers . <P> Now in April . For 2 hours his voice boomed confidently through the House of Commons as he explained just how far Britain could loosen its belt . Only thrice did he pick up the little teacup from its green tray and fortify himself with sips of rum and milk. * Once he drew a laugh as he absently rubbed his high , sun-browned bald dome , announced a reduction in the purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class bias in the Dalton budget . Purchase taxes on pots , crockery , blankets , mattresses were reduced or removed , but not on cars or furs . Income-tax rates for a married man with two chil dren and earning $1,200 a year went down from 3% to nothing ; for a man in similar circumstances earning $4,000 a year , from 30% to 24% ; for the man earning $10,000 a year , only from 68% to 65% . <P> Come December . Excess-profits taxes , earlier reduced from 1 00% to 65% , would ! end entirely by December . More impor tant , the $17 billion total expenditure was 31% less than last year 's , and 91% of it would be paid from revenue . The next budget might be even better , for more than 40% of this one goes to defense supplies , demobilization gratuities , war contract terminations and other non-recurring expenses . <P> The big " if " of the budget was the pending $3,750,000,000 U.S. loan . Without that , warned Dalton , Britain would have to cut imports sharply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if " grew less " iffy " ; the bill for the loan was sent to the U.S. Senate floor last week with a 14-to-5 vote of approval by the Banking &; Currency Committee . <P> Perhaps Dalton did not have all the answers , but opposition to the Dalton budget was perfunctory . Even Conservative speaker Anthony Eden was partially reassured : " The Chancellor has played his part , " said he , though he added , " but what are his colleagues doing ? " His answer came from Leeds ( see below ) . <P> <P> * In similar circumstances Chancellor of the Exchequer Gladstone drank eggnog ; Disraeli , brandy &; soda ; and a grinning Churchill announced that he was not sure whether his amber-colored liquid was cider or ginger ale ( he prefers brandy to either of them ) .
