Every good politician knows how important control of local governments can be to a national election . But last November , when they swept 14 of the 16 offices then at stake in Cook County , Illinois ' elated Republicans committed a major political blunder . They figured they could win this spring 's Chicago mayoralty with anybody . <P> They got some help in this belief from national headquarters . Said National Chairman B. Carroll Reece : " It will be said , undoubtedly , that the abilities and character of the individual candidate are more important than his party label . Do not be beguiled into accepting such arguments . " <P> Last week Chicago 's voters gave their answer to this political naivete . In the biggest turnout in a Chicago city election , they rejected the G.O.P. 's Russell W. Root-a political nobody-and elected the Democrats ' businessman candidate , Martin H. Kennelly , by a 273,354 majority . Kennelly 's margin had been exceeded only once before in the city 's history . <P> Observers conceded that the G.O.P. state administration 's part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the loss of about 75,000 votes . For the rest , the Republicans could blame their own blunders and the political genius of the new Democratic boss , Jake Arvey . Little Jake 's astute handling of the old Kelly machine and his timely dumping of Boss Ed himself had gone far to retrieve last November 's disaster . <P> Republicans had had fair warning . But there was some doubt whether its meaning had been driven home to Carroll Reece . He now said blandly that the Chicago election had " no special significance . " <P> In East St. Louis , Illinois ' fourth city , Mayor John T. Connors , Democrat , was elected to a third term , despite the fact that he and two of his henchmen had recently been under indictment for winking at gambling . No one was much surprised . In grimy , roistering East St. Louis , such an accusation is about the best endorsement a politician can have .
