<P> " In hanging the assassin , " said Gandhi 's old newspaper Harijan , " there is something which positively takes away from the glory of the Mahatma . . . Granting of life to murderers . . . would be an act . . . of which only a government trained by Gandhi might dream of doing . . . " <P> One morning last week , Nathuram Vinayak Godse , the young fanatic who shot Gandhi ( TIME , Feb. 9 , 1948 ) , drank his last cup of prison coffee . While jailers waited , Godse and his accomplice , Narayan Dattatraya Apte , recited from the Hindu Holy Writ , the Bhagavad-Gita ( " Fight , and have no fear . The foe is yours to conquer " ) . They walked to the scaffold , clutching their Gitas between the palms of their tied hands . <P> Then they were hanged by the neck until dead .
