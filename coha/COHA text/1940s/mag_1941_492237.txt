25 W HEN the late Mary Desti , the mother of Preston Sturges , incorporated her Fifth Avenue I cosmetic business as the Mai-son Desti , she named an office boy as one of her dummy directors . A few days later she received a telephone call from the Maison Desti informing her that the office boy had gone mad . Mme. Desti went to the scene immediately . She learned that the office boy had been scolding the manager , requiring financial statements from the bookkeeper , rearranging the furniture and reorganizing the personnel . The great Desti herself was then called on the carpet and lectured on the principles of business administration . As soon as she had a chance to get a word in , she began to question the boy soothingly . She learned that he had been reading a fat calfskin volume which set forth the duties and responsibilities of directors . He had discovered that he could he sued for millions , fined and jailed , if he neglected his obligations . Far from being a lunatic , the boy was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . Thousands of directors would have been saved from damage suits and jail if they had followed his example . The boy , however , was fired . That was about twenty years ago , and there seems to be no record of his subsequent history . The Great McGinty T HE office boy underwent several transformations in the mind of Preston Sturges and finally emerged on the screen last year in the form of The Great McGinty . McGinty is the third-ward gorilla who rises in public life because of bad qualities which endear him to a political machine . But on being elected a dummy governor , McGinty is , Iike the office boy , suddenly impressed with his own dignity . He commits one good act and is hounded out of society . There was some complaint that the McGinty story was exaggerated , but it is basically a familiar tale in many states . " Old Bill " Sulzer , veteran Tammany politician , was impeached and thrown out of the governorship when he was caught in the act of promoting the welfare of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story with authentic detail because of long conversations with the late city magistrate , Andy McCrery . Both as a machine worker and a minor judge , Andy had an intimate knowledge of election stealing , graft , larceny and other branches of the black art of local government . These conversations were later particularly impressed on Sturges by the circumstances of McCrery 's death in 1929 . The price usually quoted for a Tammany Supreme Court justiceship at that time was $75,000 ; the price of a city magistracy was $35,000 . McCrery made his down payment and some of his installments , but then fell into arrears and was beaten to death . As the lawenforcement agencies were then in Tammany hands , it was found possible not to discover the slayers . " Remember what happened to McCrery " became a historic reminder of Tanimany 's energetic dunning tactics . Lessons From Life TURGES wrote the screen play seven years ago under the title of The Mantle of Dignity . He took it to a famous producer , who went to sleep four times during the reading of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " sordid " and " unattractive . " All the important picture studios rejected it at one time or another . It . was on that account that Sturges got the opportunity to direct his own story and to strike a heavy blow at the Hollywood bucketbrigade theory that an idea must pass through innumerable hands before it is ready to be photographed . The McGinty picture was not an exposure , a sat ire or a political document . Sturges is not a Lincoln Stefi w feils or a Samuel Seahury . The boys 411 the Kelly-Nash or Hague machine might regard the picture as a justification of their existence , especially when the boss utters the line that the state " has had honest government for so long that the whole damn place is in rack and ruin . " The playwright 's only purpose was to tell a good story . In combining the oilice-boy and citymagistrate episodes . Sturges merely followed his usual procedure of taking material from his experience and reworking it for the stage or se ref , r I . Whiifi he first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sturges started to dramatize the first thing he saw . As old before , an operation for appendicitis in 1927 transformed him from an unsuccessful cosmetician and inventor into a playwright . After he emerged from the ether , he started to dramatize the Presbyterian Hospital in Chicago . He got Irvin S. Cobb 's permission to turn Speaking of Operations into an operetta ; he planned to dress his chorus in chic nurses ' uniforms ; the comedy was to be based on the humorous side of surgery . Sturges had no professional equipment ; only a conviction that he had suddenly been reincarnated as a playwright . Having heard that a dramatist needed " technique , " he bought a book . It happened to he a good book Brander Matthews ' A Study of the Drama , ( Continued from Page 81 ) " Dolly , " I said , " I 'm a changed man . I 'm going to buy a blue serge suit ; I 'm going to get a Homburg hat and a Chesterfield coat . I 'm going to dress like a banker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie , " Dolly said . " Keep it ? " " And the plaid cap . " " The cap too ? " which is still Sturges ' bible of the theater . This volume does not purport to teach stagecraft , but it is full of practical dramatic wisdom and is rich in instructive quotations . The book , together with a few phrases and aphorisms , formed Sturges ' entire professional kit when he started on his career as a playwright . The cornerstone of his knowledge was a line from the elder Dumas , translated by Sturges as follows : " Let the beginning be clear , let the end be short , and let it all be interesting . " The only trouble with this otherwise simple and infallible recipe is that it is not self-executing . " Fertility of invention " was a phrase which Sturges had heard used to explain the quality of Bayard Veiller 's dramas ; the phrase contained encouragement for Sturges , who had been a fertile though unsuccessful inventor before his appendectomy . He added a line of his Own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to have said except that you did n't think of them in time . " Finally , how ever , he adopted as his master maxim , " All generalizations are false , including this one . " But the Matthews book and the slogans were not sufficient to perfect a musical comedy about abdominal surgery . That was thirteen years ago , when musicals were all supposed to he about Heidelberg . A Broadway producer convinced Sturges that his operation operetta would not only empty its own theater but would evacuate the entire theatrical district . The plot of Sturges ' first completed play came as directly from life as any plot ever did . He had had a misunderstanding with a young lady playwright . She was n't content to give him an ordinary dusting-off ; she explained to him that she found his society painfully insipid and that she had endured it only because she wanted to discover how dull a human being could actually be , since she hoped to make one of the characters in her play the champion bore of all time . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pig for her purpose . Sturges set to work that night on his first play , The Guinea Pig . He wrote the third act in one sitting . The Brander Matthews book said that playwrighting is largely the art of preparation , of laying the foundation of things to come . Sturges found this to be true . The third act was easy ; working up to it was hard . It took him a month to write the first and second acts ; in that month he taught himself most of the profession of playwrighting . Once , when he was having trouble getting characters on and off the stage , he sought outside help on technique . He went to see Tonight at Twelve , by Owen Davie , the most experienced dramatist in the country . Ranging from Nellie , the Beautiful Cloak Model , to the Pulitzer prize winner , Icebound , Davis has written more than 200 " And , Willie , do all the crazy things you want to . " Who can understand women ? But I did n't care . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my son , and the sky was blue to Rockaway and Dolly loved me . Willie , I said to myself , yoo 're a fool for lock . " When it 's Mardi Gras at Coney , " I sang , Oh , when it 's Mardi Gras at Coney ? " plays . The one that Sturges saw happened to be a bad one , but it was an inspiration to him ; he felt that The Guinea Pig was great by comparison . He went home feeling like a mental giant and attacked his own problems with self-assurance . Sturges ' greatest stumbling block in writing The Guinea Pig was the tendency of his characters to wind up a conversation so completely that he could find no way of starting the dialogue again . He solved this problem by means of the " hook " system . The " hook " is planted in every line or speech ; it is a word or thought which the next character can pick up and hang his words on . The " hook " system works so well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that of keeping it going . Sturges was unable to invent any universal formula for getting his characters on and ' off the stage ; each entrance and exit had to be thought out separately . His only guide here was a certain amount of negative lore to the effect that it was old-fashioned to have a character say , " I must step out and enjoy the moonlight , " or , " I must tear myself away , because I have an engagement with Aunt Emma . " In his attempt to lift himself by his bootstraps from an amateur to a professional status in one month , Sturges failed to professionalize himself in one particular . He stuck to a habit of putting the point at the beginning instead of at the end of his comic lines , telegraphing his laugh . Like a bee , a good line should carry the sting in its tail . For example , in Sturges ' recent picture , Christmas in July , one of the characters , in denouncing a half-witted jury , says , " I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Guinea Pig days , Sturges would have written it , " I have seen umbrellas that have better heads than you have . " This fault was pointed out to him by Alexander Carr , the famous comedian of Potash and Perlmutter , who appeared in The Guinea Pig . The playwright then reversed many of his lines . Broadway producers were of one mind in rejecting The Guinea Pig . Its first performance took place at the Wharf Theater in Provincetown . Sturges had to borrow the money to get to Provincetown . As it was feared that the inexperienced actors would lose their poise if they knew the great playwright was present , Sturges was introduced as a mysterious stranger by the name of Peter Jackson . One small technical flaw appeared in the first performance . Sturges had used the same cue twice , once in the second act and once in the third . When the cue was spoken in the third act , the players did the scene from the second act over again . Aside from that , The Guinea Pig went over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered a triumph . It brought no money to the author , who gave a watch as security for fourteen dollars to pay his Provincetowu landlady and get back to New York . He went to lunch at Pirolle 's , where he had credit . The first man he met was Georges Renavent , the actor . " I 've just seen my first play produced , " said Sturges , " and it is a very funny play . " On Renavent 's recommendation , Brock Pemberton hired Sturges for sixty-four dollars a week as assistant stage manager . Pemberton was having author trouble . The man who had written the play which Pemberton was producing was always hanging around and making suggestions . Sturges ' first assignment as a theatrical executire was that of taking the author to a cafe and saying at half-hourly intervals , Let 's have another . " On the first night , Sturges had an inauspicious debut as an actor . He was one of two stretcher-bearers to a 285-pound corpse . He first took the solemnity out of the scene by walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ropes in the wings prevented the stretcherbearers from making an exit , and the deceased Goliath had to wriggle off the stage like a sea elephant . That play was a failure . Sturges was rehired as assistant stage manager for another play , also a failure . He then asked for a letter of recommendation . Pemberton gave it to him , adding , Now that you have had a taste of the theater , you 'll probably never do an honest day 's work as long as you live . " During this time Sturges talked constantly about The Guinea Pig to anyone who would listen . , He held forth most insistently on the subject at The BrokenDown Stage Managers ' Club , an informal group which met shortly after midnight at Childs Restaurant in Times Square and stayed there drinking coffee and talking theater until daybreak . It had been estimated that it would require $15,000 to produce the Sturges play . Charles H. Abramson , the producer , who was a member of the club , said he could put it on for $2500 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or it M usica to do this . Sturges , however , mentioned $2500 everywhere he went . One day he named that sum in the presence of a lady , who walked right over to a table and wrote a check for that amount . Baptism of Fire Sturges obtained the scenery by giving 25 per cent of the show to a scene builder . He signed up Alexander Carr , a $2500-a-week actor , for a small salary and 10 per cent of the gross , but he had to pay $750 down to ransom the comedian , who was practically a prisoner in the Hotel Manger pending payment of his bill . Oscar Serlin , now the producer of Life With Father , was hired as general manager at fifty dollars a week . Sturges engaged a leading man and a leading lady ; they quit to take more promising parts with another producer ; he hired two more to take their places ; they quit for the same reason . The third set stayed with him , however . Sturges broke the news to the third leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  eighteen dollars fur a street dress and twenty-five dollars for an evening gown . He advised her to outfit herself in Klein 's basement . She said she would cut her throat first . Finally she bought her own clothes at Milgrim 's , to be paid for if sufficient cash ever accumulated in the box office . The playhouse itself was a bargain at $300 a week , but it only held 300people . Sturges economized where he could by doing most of the odd jobs , such as stoking the furnace . After a sea of small troubles , the crisis came when there was no more money for rehearsals and there was an absolute necessity for an out-oftown tryout , which would normally cost $5000 or more . At this point Sturges had an inspiration . He had once , seen a summer show at the Beechwood Theater on the Frank A. Vanderlip estate in Scarborough in Westchester County a few miles outside New York City . It now struck him that it might be a popular novelty to hold a winter opening in a summer theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an event in the wealthy suburban community , He got the theater for thirty dollars a night , with the gardeners from the estate thrown in to act as stagehands , and with the free use of tapestries and antiques from the Vanderlip mansion as stage properties . The audiences were enthusiastic . The play was praised in the suburban newspapers . Two-Line Inspiration The Guinea Pig opened in New York within the $2500 limit and received good notices . George S. Kaufman , then second-string dramatic critic on The New York Times , placed a stamp of moderate approval on it . He noted a trace of amateurishness , but considered that a merit rather than a drawback . The play ran for sixty-seven performances . It had one grave defect : the guinea pig was not then so well known in its capacity of a laboratory animal ; theatergoers were repelled by a vague idea that the play dealt with rats . The title was changed to Passion Preferred when the show was taken to Philadelphia , but that did n't work either . Another trouble was that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the background . This faction , eager to please a woman who wrote $2500 checks offhand , fired the leading lady and substituted the backer 's daughter . Sturges made no money except his salary of fifty dollars a week , but he had his experience and his name 218 a playwright . He kept a diary and scrapbook on his first play ; at the conclusion of it he wrote in a big round hand , " Thus endeth the first lesson . " Sturges then went on the road as assistant stage manager for another show . It failed in Chicago and he settled down there to write another play . He had nothing to start with except two lines from an ancient conversation : SHE : What are your intentions toward me ? HE : Strictly dishonorable . The bark of these lines , both in the ancient conversation and in the play , was worse than the bite . Strictly Dishonorable was , in fact , selected as the title of the play because the behavior of the characters was , technically . honorable . Sturges was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hardheaded stockbroker , The broker was disgusted when the playwright announced that he was going to write his new play in thirty days . He was still more disgusted when his foster son wrote it in nine days and started to rave about its transcendent merit . Preston calculated the time it would take the manuscript to reach Pemberton by mail and the time it would take Pemberton to read it ; he then predicted that a telegram of congratulations and ( Continued from Page 86 ) reasons against it , he had spent a fortune on private detectives , who had turned up startling information to the effect that Sturges , among other things , had not written Strictly Dishonorable , but that his mother had written it for him . Sturges left Tony 's that night in great dismay and hunted up his close friend and adviser , Charles H. Abramson , the theatrical producer . Abramson listened calmly and said , " What of it ? " " What of it ? " said Sturges . " Nothing except that it is the worst thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere in search of material , " said Abramson . " How 's that ? " asked Sturges . " An author can go anywhere in search of material , " repeated Abramson . Sturges saw the point . Giving it out that he was writing a play ahout taxidance hells , he sat dow n and wrote one . The result was Child of Manhattan . It served its purpose of killing the tabloid story and had a brief run on Broadway , after which the movie rights were sold for $40,000 . Picture money is split fifty-fifty between playwright and producer under ordinary circumstances . But Sturges ' producer was A. C. Blumenthal , better known as " Blumey , " a dexterous businessman . With more than his usual dexterity , " Blarney " arranged the split in this case : $38,000 to A. C. Blumenthal , $2000 to Sturges . Sturges was advised to sue , but he decided that he could make money faster by writing for the movies . The picture money was useful , as he lost $64.000 in producing an operetta called The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Recapture , which apparently went wrong because audiences were disappointed by the tragic finish . His first picture script , The Big Pond . written fur Maurice Chevalier , was a success , but a financial mistake for Sturges . He wrote it in two weeks at $1000 a week . and later learned that $111,000 was the ordinary price for a script of this type . After alternating between stage and pictures for a while , Sturges settled down in Hollywood . lie was once asked at Paramount when he was going to write another play . He replied , " I have never stopped writing plays . This is the theater . " Pioneering in Hollywood He wrote his first movie at the Astoria studio in New York City . That was in the early days of the talkies , when it was thought that the picture industry might have to move to New York City in order to he near the dialogue writers . In 1932 Sturges first went to California to write H. G. Wells ' The Invisible Man for Universal . Eight scripts had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wells too closely . The Sturges script was shelved hecause it did not follow Wells closely enough . Sturges made his first decided impression on Hollywood in 1933 with The Power and the Glory , which he wrote at home between studio engagements . It was a trail blazer in several respects . It is said to have been unheard of up to that time for a writer , acting as his own boss , to write a complete , or shooting , script . It was such a novelty that Jesse L. Lasky , who produced it , did not know how to place a valuation on it , so he gave Sturges a down payment of $17,500 and a percentage of the gross . This is said to have been the first time that a screen writer was ever cut in on the gross . William K. Howard , the director , and Lasky were both so impressed with the script that they decided that it should go before the earners without a change of any kind . That was also a pioneer adventure . Some critics predicted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glory , motion pictures would soon cease to represent the missteps of a puzzled mob and become one-man enterprises . These prophets ' were wrong , or at least premature ; The Power and the Glory caused a stir , but started no trend . The picture had one important incidental result . It put Spencer Tracy on the map after his great talents had been wasted for years on quickies . The Golden Ladder Sturges had made the mistake of starting at $1000 a week in the pictures , Once a man accepts soap cou-pons like that , he usually remains a $1000-a-week slave for the rest of his life . A $1000-a-week man may do great work for years without getting a raise ; a $2000-a-week man may do bad work for years without getting a cut . As far as Hollywood is concerned , a salary is something that a man is born with ; an inherent attribute , like his height or the color of his eyes . This is what makes it so serious to be in the $1000-a-week class ; it is almost impossible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonders what he uses for money . He has to pay cash on the barrelhead for everything ; tradesmen quickly learn that he has taken a vow of poverty . Now and then , one of these untouchables gets to see t he color of real money , but such cases are rare . Sturges managed to climb out of the depths and reach the subsistence level of $2500 a week as a result of accidents . Haulier ' Mamoulian , who was directing Resurrection far Samuel Goldwyn , liked the work of Sturges and insisted on having him . Sturges wanted $1500 a week to work for Goldwyn . Sam was more outraged and indignant than usual . However , Anna Steil was to appear in Resurrection ; Sam was so eager to make her a great star that he allowed Mamoulian to have his way temporarily . Goldwyn soon fired Sturges , but the salary was now fixed at $1500 a week and other studios paid it without question . A little later Universal came to Sturges and wanted a script turned out in a great hurry because contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near future . Sturges offered to do the script for $10,000 and promised to finish it in a month . Executives of Universal said such an arrangement would perplex their bookkeeping department and asked Sturges if he would take a straight salary of $2500 a week . Sturges consented . That made him a $2500-a-week man . He was never even asked to take less . He was like the man with seven hero medals who received the first medal by mistake and the six others because he had the first . When The Power and the Glory was being shot in 1933 , Sturges remained on the set as a consultant or technical ad-viser . This was equivalent to a ten-week course in directing under William K. Howard . Ever since then , Sturges has had the ambition to direct his own script . It has been his contention that director and writer understand each other better when the director and writer are the same man . Though some of his scripts have been well directed , Jr ' ( Continued from Page 88 ) others have not ; every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition to be his own director has been rekindled in Sturges . Among the pictures written by him and directed k by others were The Good Fairy , Diamond Jim Brady , Easy Living , If I Were King and Remember the Night . When Sturges first started on a campaign to direct for himself , he was repeatedly confronted by the maxim that it was best to let well enough alone . Finally he asserted that the desire to direct was afflicting him like a mortal disease . William Le Baron , studio chief at Paramount , said , " All right . I 've never known a man to go wrong who had so much enthusiasm . " The office-boy story , which had at various times been called The Mantle of Dignity , The Biography of a Bum , and Down Went McGinty was finally entitled The Great McGinty and given to Sturges to direct . As a gesture of enthusiasm and good will , Sturges gave the script to the studio for one dollar . The price was later raised to ten dollars ; the legal department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the whole thing was an experiment , the studio did not care to make a big investment in the picture , and Sturges was not allowed to make use of costly stars . When he was looking for an actor for the part of McGinty , Sturges happened to remember a remark by George Jean Nathan on Mae West ; the critic had said that one factor in her sensational success was that audiences , bored by a decade of adolescent stars , found it a novelty to look at a woman . Conversely , Sturges sought to get as far away as possible from the tomboy for junior-college-student type of hero , 91 so he chose Brian Donlevy , who was as undebatably male as a Memphremagog bull moose . Donlevy , previously known as a rugged villain , was a perfect McGinty , but he gave Sturges sleepless nights at the outset . In the discussion of his part , Donlevy objected to the way Sturges read one of the lines . Cold chills ran up and down the new director 's spine . He felt that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every point . On the morning when shooting started , Sturges dropped in at Donlevy 's dressing room . The actor , about to play the part of a Bowery bum , was wearing an artistically clipped mustache , and Sturges feared that Donlevy was prepared to defend the mustache with his life . The director took a walk around the Paramount lot as he considered how to handle this problem . Then he went back to the actor 's dressing room . " I was wondering about that mustache , " he said . " Do n't you like it ? " demanded Donlevy . " I certainly do not , " said Sturges . " Off it comes , " said the actor . Sturges now felt that he had passed the crisis , but there were two more chills in store for him . On the set he found that the camera was not where he had indicated it should be put . The photographer thought the shot should be taken from a different position . Sturges ordered it back . He picked up the finder and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot for the camera . Everybody on the set had eyes fixed rather skeptically on the new director . It made him nervous . He kept putting the finder to his eye without being able to see anything . ( Continued from Page 91 ) The cameraman said , " Perhaps you had better look through the other end . " There was a laugh , in which Sturges joined hollowly . " That just gives you an idea , " he . " said , " of what to expect from now on . " The early scenes showed Donlevy voting thirty-seven times in one day . In one balloting place , as he painfully forged a name on the register , he was scrutinized by a suspicious lady election official . Under the directions of Sturges , Donlevy kept his nose almost on the pen point as he wrote , while the suspicious lady had her nose only a few millimeters away . Eying each other dubiously , they lifted their heads slowly , so that their profiles came together like revolving sprockets . Like most visual gags , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on paper , but everybody who saw it recognized that Sturges knew his business . Donlevy slapped him on the shoulder and said , " Boy , you 're going to he tops . " From that point on , the director had no trouble with actors or technical men . His next trouble was pneumonia , which sent him to bed on the eleventh day of shooting . Sturges believed his long-sought opportunity had vanished . He thought another director would be - substituted immediately . Worry sent his fever up to 104 . The rushes of the early scenes in McGinty , however , had impressed the studio greatly . William Le Baron sent word to Sturges that work would be suspended until his recovery , even if it took three weeks . On this news the fever dropped immediately and Sturges was buck to work in a week . &; The Great McGinty was one of the surprise hits of the year . Sturges proved that he was not a flash in the pan by following this up with another surprise hit in Christmas in July . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There had been writer-directors before ? Capra , La Cava , McCarey , Wellman and others . The Sturges pictures were unique , however , in that the original idea , the picture script and the direction were all the work of one man . Probably because there could be no conflict of ideas between writer and director in the case of Sturges , his pictures have a speed like the great chases of the silent days . There is another mark of the great director in Sturges ' work : he takes infinite pains even with the least important of his characters . The man who speaks only one word or who says nothing registers as a definite personality in the Sturges pictures . The Tin-Pan Touch Sturges has a few side lines . He is a song writer , restaurateur , Diesel-engine manufacturer and general inventor . He became a musician in the late 20 's through answering an ad by a man calling himself Piano Bill . Bill offered his correspondence course in pianoforte at a special rate of twenty-five dollars ; Sturges did not answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special price of fifteen dollars ; then ten dollars ; then , with the warning " now or never , " to five dollars ; then to one dollar , The last offer brought the Piano Bill system within Sturges ' means . i ? It is a system which does not involve the reading of notes ; Sturges still uses it , playing the piano with spirit and originality . On the failure of his project for making an operetta out of Speaking of Operations , Sturges had been left with hints for various tunes which he had laboriously worked out by the Piano Bill technique . Hiring Sammy Grossman as an arranger , he wrote several songs , including Keep Smiling . With the help of a process of intaglio ; engraving which he had invented himself , Sturges produced business cards of irresistible elegance . These homemade passports opened the doors of big music publishers who made it a rule never to have personal contact with newcomers . Louis Bernstein , of Shapiro , Bernstein &; Co. , picked up the object of art between his thumb and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned who his visitors were . " Now that you 're here , let 's have it , " he said . Grossman played and Sturges sang Keep Smiling . " Another one of those damned cheer-up tunes , " groaned Bernstein . " They 've almost ruined the business already . " From Soup to Song Grossman and Sturges tried another . " They 're amateurish , " said Bernstein , " and you wo n't know why they 're amateurish , because you 're amateurs . " Ted Snyder , author of My Wife 's Gone to the Country , gave Sturges a hearing . " This is terrible , " he said . " You do n't know anything about writing tunes , but I think you have a talent for writing lyrics  --  that is , short sentences . " Every night for six weeks Snyder took him to dinner and then gave him instruction in song writing . At the end of this period , Snyder said , " Now you are a professional . You may not be any good , but you are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , My Cradle of Dreams , which was later published . Sturges ' own published works include Oh , Minnie , Keep Smiling , Asia Minor Blues , Maybe You 'll be My Baby , and others . Years later Snyder went to Hollywood and decided to open a restaurant . Sturges backed him . The venture collapsed . The playwright , however , had become interested in the restaurant business , probably because it gave so much scope for his inventive gifts . A few months ago he opened his own restaurant , The Players , for which he invented tables that slide on tracks , and windows that open and shut at the touch of a button . Sturges got into the Diesel-engine business a few years ago when he built a yacht . He had learned a good deal about boats in his early life in France and something about engines in 1917 and 1918 when he was in the U. S. air service . For his Hollywood yacht . he built a specially designed vibration-less Diesel engine ; a fifty-cent piece can be placed on edge on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . Sturges went into business with the designer , Ivan A. Addison , establishing the Sturges Engineering Corporation at Wilmington , California . One of Sturges ' inventions is a doubleexercising rowing machine . The user gets ordinary rowing exercise by pulling the oars ; the machine then pulls the oars back and the user gets the extra exercise by resisting . Sturges has not seen his yacht or paid too much attention to his other side lines since he became a director .
