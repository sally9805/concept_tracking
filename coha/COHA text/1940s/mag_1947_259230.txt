Twenty-three years had passed since Vladimir Ilyich Lenin 's death . Two scientists last week assured the ikon-loving Russians : " We are convinced that Lenin 's body will remain in its present state for hundreds of years . " Lenin 's place in the Soviet hagiology , however , was not equally secure ; he was becoming a mere peg on which to hang verbal votive offerings to Russian nationalism and to Stalin . <P> Comrade Pompadour . At last week 's memorial ceremonies , a huge , floodlit portrait of Lenin looked down from the faade of Moscow 's Bolshoi Theater . But when the official party arrived , the crowd 's eyes turned from Lenin 's benignly sly features to those of Premier Stalin . Inside , on the red-draped stage , Georgi Fiodorovich Alexandrov , chief of the Party Central Committee 's Bureau of Propaganda and Agitation , delivered the memorial address : <P> " Consolidating its ranks around Comrade Stalin , the party smashed the enemies of the people , all manner of counterrevolutionary Trotskyites , Bukharinites and other traitors and capitulators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Britain and the United States launched their biggest military operations only after . . . it had become clear that the Soviet Army was able to ... liberate the peoples of Europe from the German fascist yoke . . . without Allied assistance . " <P> From Soviet ex-Minister to Sweden Alexandra Mikhailovna Kollontay , 74 ( also known as the Madame Pompadour of the Russian Revolution ) , came a bit of rhapsodic reminiscence : " I remember the room in Smolny where the Central Committee met . The windows looked out on to the Neva , and a strong wind from the river rattled the panes . One electric lamp burned dimly over a small table around which the Committee members met . The situation was tense . ... On Lenin 's right sat Stalin in his dark Russian shirt , his silent self-possession forming a strong contrast to the excited tirades of some of our number . . . . Stalin was the very personification of strong will , clarity of purpose and coolheadedness . " <P> In 1920 , Kollontay had temporarily broken with the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what looked like a coy explanation of why she took so long to be converted to Stalinism : " Stalin . . . always seemed engrossed in his thoughts , so that when we met him , we hesitated to accost him for fear of interrupting his chain of thought . " <P> Whoosh ! Next day , U.S. Communists got around to paying their tribute to Little Father Lenin at Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden . Climax of the memorial rally was unquestionably a song ( see cut ) . The words were by C.I.O. Organizer Vern Partlow , music ( a prolonged monotone ) by leftist , talented Earl Robinson ( Ballad for Americans , Porterhouse Lucy ) . Robinson rendered it in person , strumming his guitar and crooning close to the party line : <P> We hold this truth to be self-evident <P> That all men may be cremated equal . .. . <P> Atoms to atoms and dust to dust , <P> If you listen to the moneybags , something 's bound to bust . . . . <P> Listen folks , here is my thesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces <P> Whooooosh ! * <P> <P> * c 1947 by People 's Songs , Inc.
