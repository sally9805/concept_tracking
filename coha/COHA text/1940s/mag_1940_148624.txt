More than sheltered has been Japan 's little Crown Prince Akihito ; he has lived in a positive vacuum . At the age of three he was removed even from his own family , shut up in a house of 774 mats ( 3,096 square yards of floor space ) on the Palace grounds , under the constant surveillance of four tutors , two governesses , three physicians and 60 retainers . At the age of five he was permitted to meet eight hand-picked noble moppets , who visited his compound on Saturdays and squabbled over his princely bicycle and sandbox , while Akihito stood by and gaped . <P> On rare occasions , he is taken unannounced into the public world . In the hope that he had inherited his father 's passionate interest in " biology , " he was taken to Uyeno Park Zoo one day last autumn .

Then he romps all day in the Palace grounds . Once a fortnight he attends the peers ' kindergarten , where he outbellows all his little comrades in patriotic songs . <P> But last week the carefree life was drawing to a close for Akihito . His cute rice-bowl bob was shaved right to the pate . He was given last fittings for a navy blue serge uniform trimmed with red cord , a cap with a bright brass cherry blossom badge . The Prince was ready for school . <P> To protect Akihito on his daily passage to the exclusive Peers ' School would have required whole battalions of police to line the streets . The Imperial Household totted up the cost , found it would be cheaper to build a new schoolhouse next to the Palace grounds . They did-complete with twelve classrooms , auditorium , laboratories , music hall , handicraft room , gymnasium , library , offices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This week for the first time , the son of the son of the Sun , with shining morn ing face , romped across the Palace grounds , across one public street , to school . On rainy days he will ride-in a red lacquered , charcoal-burning car . After six years , a special educational institution will be built around Akihito , and professors will lecture a one-man class on The Art of Becoming an Emperor .
