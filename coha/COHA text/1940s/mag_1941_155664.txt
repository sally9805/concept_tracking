The Are You a Missing Heir ? program ( sponsored by Ironized Yeast and created by Lawyer James Waters and Adman Alfred Shebel ) , which for nearly two years has been dramatizing each week over CBS true tales of estranged souls whose deaths - and estates-were unknown to their presumptive heirs , last week turned up its luckiest missing heir so far : a quiet , 40-year-old , much-buffeted Chicagoan named Rawlins Phillips . His inheritance : $85,000 . <P> Rawlins ' mother took her son and left his father when the boy was two because Father Phillips , a dining-car steward on the Santa Fe , would not give up railroading . Father Phillips dropped dead in Kansas City last May . He had invested his earnings to good purpose . Fortnight ago his story was broadcast . Son Phillips and his wife had heard all but one of the Missing Heir programs . That evening they were-for the second time in two years-not listening . But friends told them about it . Last week they claimed their estate .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
