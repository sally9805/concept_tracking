txt The House Rules Committee , which has blocked the universal military training program from floor consideration for nearly ten months , was urged by the majority of the armed services committee today to permit a two-year revival of the draft to go to a voting showdown in its place . Although Rules Committee hearings usually are completed at a single session , Representative Leo E. Allen , Republican , of Illinois , the chairman , served notice that these hearings might go on for a week or two , at this stage of adjournment rush . Mr. Allen is an open foe of both universal military training and the stop-gap draft . In blocking universal military training by not . scheduling hearings on the bill , which the Armed Services Committee approved last July , Mr. Allen has had the support in this election year of the Republican House leadership and many Democrats as well as Republicans of the rank and file . Thus , the committee holds a position of great power . Allen Predicts Approval Chairman Allen predicted today that , despite prospective delays so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on here ? " the committee eventually would allow the draft bill to gn to the House floor . Some members said this might be done next week . Others were noncommital . While the House rules body was holding its first hearing on the manpower problem , the House Armed Services Committee approved unanimously a prompt concentration upon the building of an American aircraft carrier of most " super " dimensions . It would be the biggest craft afloat . It would base , even In Arctic waters , planes that could handle atomic bombs over an operational radius of 1,700 // miles . A subcommittee yesterday gave the first Congressional support . The authorization measure was expected to receive approval of the full House promptly . As the rules committee took up the question of sending the stopgap selective draft measure to the floor , a unique method of argument was introduced . Representative Walter G. Andrews of New York , Armed Service Committee chairman , had faced the rules body with the related problem , the UMT , last July . He got nowhere . Today Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had developed within his ' own committee as the draft program was deliberated . He gave the replies of the Armed Services Committee 's majority of twentyeight to the complaints against the I draft program raised by the minority of five . They ran as follows : Opponents of the draft  --  a revived selective service will say to the world that the United States expects war , that it is convinced that the world is irrevocably divided into power blocs . Military threats will not meet the economic needs of Europe , as have been planned by the European Recovery Program . Mr. Andrews : There remains a necessity for military support to the integrity of the ERP . American economic and military efforts are interdependent . The ERP is not sufficient unto Itself , " because Soviet communism does not expand the areas of its control through economic misery alone . " " It spreads , " representative Andrews continued , " as well by the application of excessive political pressure , backed by a poised military strength . " Previous testimony had indicated that Russia had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans , most of whom were deployed in foreign theatres . This , it was pointed out , was in comparison with data that showed the American armed forces to be undermanned in about every military department . A second opposition argument was put this way : the United States , through the proposed draft , would promote distrust and unrest abroad by spending billions for preparedness . Mr. Andres replied : There is ( he underscored the word " is " ) a large portion of the non-Communist world today that is in for great trouble . But , except for a realization by Russia that the United States would go to war to block power encroachments upon nations trying to be free , the whole of western Europe , as one example , could be overrun and consolidated with comparative ease in a possible enemy camp . Need for Security Cited Opposition : The proposed stopgap draft would destroy the careers of young men and affect adversely their lives by taking them from their homes at a formative age . Mr. Andrews : Many young men would suffer an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some even might have to give up higher education already started . This disadvantage , he argued , would have to be weighed against the requirements of national security . Another opposition argument was replied to by Mr. Andrews . It was as follows : that inasmuch as the United States has the greatest navy , a splendid air force , the atomic bomb and a superb industrial capacity , there is no need foz an increase in Army ground forces , where the greatest call foz Manpower exists . Mr. Andrews argued that the ground forces were needed to do these things in the event of an emergency ; Serve as strategic reserves foz the American forces scattered throughout the world . He said that , if reserves should have to be drawn upon if trouble broke out abroad , they could be supplied from only 2 1/3 divisions at home , none of them at fighting strength . Men were needed , he said , to serve with the United Nations police force , when it was established . Vital , he added , was the need fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air force in the event of war . The Senate Armed Forces coin ? mittee , meanwhile , grappled win the problems of an industrial re . serve in case of serious interns , tional trouble .
