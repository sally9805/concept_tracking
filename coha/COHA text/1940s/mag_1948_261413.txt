Will television put newspapers out of business ? To help find out , the New York Times made a five-day test-yourself survey . Last week , at a meeting of the New York State Publishers ' Association , the Times ' ' ' s Publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger announced the comforting results . The Times is practically untelevisable . <P> " During those five days , " he said , " the New York Times published just over 2,000 individual stories . In making this check , the stock table was counted as one story whereas reports from London and Berlin of the same situation were counted as separate stories . Of these 2,068 stories we calculate that 207 , or 10% , would have lent themselves to some phase of television . . . Fully half of these were in the sports category . . . Only . . . eleven appeared on Page One and it is doubted that more than six would have been good viewing . <P> " Television and radio can never replace the newspaper which devotes itself to the comprehensive publication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper , which gives information , is not threatened by them . On the other hand , the newspaper which holds its readers through its entertainment features is , threatened . . . The New York Times at the present moment has no plans for entering the television field . " * <P> In Harper 's Magazine , New York Lawyer Bernard B. Smith took a less professional but much darker view . " Newspaper publishers , " said he , " are threatened by television 's sudden rise . That the publishers realize this is demonstrated by the fact that about half of the applications for television licenses have been filed by newspapers . . . According to many surveys and tests , television advertising has a sharper impact than advertising either in the newspaper or over the radio . When , therefore , five years from now . . . there are 11 million television-equipped homes in America , as against the present figure of only some 400,000 , a not inconsiderable portion of our free American press may be headed toward becoming a bankrupt press . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York channel is now available . The Times also has no plans for a fac simile edition , after months of experimental trans mission .
