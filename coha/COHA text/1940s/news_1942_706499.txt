txt The white rabbit has been pulled out of the American hat for the duration . Ordinarily , U. S. hat manufacturers use about eight million rabbit skins a year  --  mostly white rabbits from continental Europe . Native American rabbit fur is too coarse for the fine felt bat makers want . The dearth of continental iabbits will not stop production of felt hats , but it will limit the number of colors available and just about eliminate pastel shades , light grays and buffs for men , pinks , blues and pale greens for women . The darker furs still available wo n't take light dyes There is still a little white rabbit fur available . cal efully culled out from the light parts of Russian rabbit pelts . But that supply is limited and erratic . English rabbit skins are available in quantity but , unfortunately , the British rabbit runs to dark colorings , limiting its usefulness . Run Into Competition Hat manufacturers , when their normal European sources were that cut oft by the German conquest , turned to Australia for supplies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay higher prices because they were making " leopard skin " coats from rabbit pelts . The coat makers have n't competed for the English product , apparently because the pelts are smaller than the Australian variety . In addition to rabbit furs , hat manufacturers use bearer for their most expensive creations . Also the synthetic felt made from milk casein ( known as arlac ) is mixed with furs used in some lines . The supply of furs is only one of the wartime problems confronting hat manufacturers . In making felt hats , brims are reinforced by dipping in a solution of shellac , and there is a limited supply of shellac for everything but direct war uses . There has been very active Pperimentatior with starstittit , : ? 5 ( phonograph iecord makers Si ... ! e the Litt raansif.cturer 's anxiety over the shellac shortage , but as yet no entirely satisfactory replacement has been reported . The lack of shellac eventually may cut down on derby production , because this type headgear needs a lot of stiffening . One Substitute May Stay For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine silks and satins ; these materials are now being replaced with rayon . Dyestuffs are more difficult to obtain and some substitutes are being used , but manufacturers do n't feel too enthusiastic . At least , they are not talking about keeping them after the war . In one department , at least , a substitute is expected to become a permanent feature of hat making . Ever since furs were first worked into felt hats , manufacturers have treated the pelts with a solution of nitrate of mei cury This was tricky stuff to work with and recently an equally efficient non-mercuric solution was found . Its great merit is that it can not affect the health of workers using it Supply problems of the felt hat department are more than matched by the straw hat division which ordinarily draws its major supplies from China . Japan . the Plullippines and Java . Whether in anticipation of hostilities in the Orient . or in anticipation of higher prices , importers accumulated large supplies of rice and baku reeds last winter from China and Japan . However , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Phillip-pines Panama hats are made from the Jipi Jana palm grown in Ecuador and supplies are limited only by transportation space . All in all , the stra.v hat situation is better than would appear on the surface . Manufacturers say that supplies are ample to carry through not only this summer but perhaps next year as well . Higher Priced Hats in Demand In the meantime , the American male seems to be concentrating his buying on the higher priced hats . Hat Corp . one of. , the leading manufacturers , reports an increase of about 30 ' , in its hats selling for $7 30 and higher . with strong demand for the $10 and better grades The history of felt hat manufacturing antedates ancient Greece and Rome . As early as 1662 , the colonial government in Virginia offered 10 pounds of tobacco for every good wool or felt hat made there and by 1731 the British Parliament became worried about the 10.000 beaver hats made in New York and New England that year Hat manufacture has remained pretty miah an industry of the Atlanta- seaboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry Year in and year out , the American hatmaking business has been safely in the $100 million class , figured at the wholesale price level Production runs in excess of 90 million hats a year . In 1939 , the ls ' . t year for which complete statistics are available . about 20.4 million fur felt hats were made , valued at more than $42 million Last year sales and production figures ran about 10 " , higher . Straw hat sales which had dropped to 10 million , with an $8,896,000 value in 1939 have been rising sharply . Last year they ran about 40 ? , over the 1939 level . This is attributed by the trade to the introduction of multi-colored , lighter hats Wool felts and chat the industry calls " harvest " straws , the big brimmed coarse straw hats favored by farmers and truck drivers , and other varieties boost total hat production to around 90 million annually . Him Felt Hats Are Made The manufacture of modern felt hats begins 1 ? the fur shop where skins are cleaned , chemically treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lawn mower . It is then sorted acording to grade , and sent to the forming mill where it goes into a machine resembling a cotton carder Here the fur is constantly agitated by air currents which remove any foreign matter . After cleaning , the fur is weighed out and put through what is called a starting machine which blows the fur onto a large cone-shaped sieve which is removed and dipped into a warm water solution . At this stage , the hat resembles a huge dunce cap about three feet long . It is then shrunk by a couple of processes , dyed . the brim shellacked and put on a block to be tipped , brimmed and blocked . At this stage the material begins to look like a hat . It is later sandpapered , reblockerl , treated with oil and colored powder to give it an even shade , banded , lined and labeled . Most of these processes are done with machines in the lower priced hats , but the higher priced lines still are made very largely by hand Even when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's problems are not over . Hats u huh once went out in fancy band boxes are now shipped mostly in cartons . Manufacturers are asking and getting the cooperation of retailers who are taking athance shipments . Some have returned packing cartons to an effort to conserve supplies .
