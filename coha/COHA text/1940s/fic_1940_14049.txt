SCENE Before the Temple at Jerusalem , in the year 8 A.D. It is night , and we see only half of one vast column of the Temple , which ascends at the right . At its base are two or three steps leading into the Temple . At the extreme left there is a low wall which marks the boundary of a courtyard before the Temple . A Roman SOLDIER is pacing back and forth between the steps and the wall , looking out occasionally , toward the sky . A WOMAN , wearing a Greek cloak and head-dress , appears at the left . THE GREEK WOMAN Soldier ! MARIUS Yes , woman ! THE GREEK WOMAN I brought the wine . MARIUS You 're late . THE GREEK WOMAN No , soldier ; you told me to come when the red star touched the earth . MARIUS You pnobably waited for the wrong star . Or your husband was awake and you could n't leave . They say never trust a Greek or a woman , and you 're both . THE GREEK WOMAN I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine . She brings out an earthen wine bottle , and a handful of dates . I 've been watching those stars go by six deadly hours , without one human squeak or rustle to keep me awake . This Jerusalem  --  the Jews must have a good conscience ; when they sleep , by Jupiter , they sleep ! He drinks from the bottle. p. 3 THE GREEK WOMAN And you sleep a little , just a little sometimes ! MARIUS If they caught me asleep here they 'd run a short sword through my lower intestines and shove me in a corner . No , I do n't sleep . I walk up and down on this sentry path , and by the procreative gods of Rome , and the polluted gods of Greece , and the pimping gods of Egypt , I keep good watch . He eats . THE GREEK WOMAN But here in the night , by a Jewish temple , where nobody comes and nobody cares who comes , why should it matter if it 's not guarded ? He sits warily , looking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my mouse . Herod 's crazy , like his father . He sits there in his palace , and thinks he sees the walls cracking , and fire leaking up through the floors , and devils tearing the curtains . He jumps and glares and there 's nothing there . He thinks the Messiah 's coming and he 'll be snatched down into some Jewish hell to squirm on a grill-while the Messiah rules the chosen people . Now Caesar knows Herod 's crazy , and ca n't trust any Jew to knife the Messiah when he appears , so Caesar lends a few Romans to guard key points and satisfy the old dolt that everything 's under control . THE GREEK WOMAN But this Messiah , what is he ? p. 4 MARIUS Mouse , I never saw a Messiah , but I gather he 's a kind of Jewish god from the machine , let down from the Jewish heaven in a golden chariot of fire , to purge the heathen . And according to the Jews you 're a Greek heathen and I 'm a Roman heathen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink . She takes the bottle . He starts up suddenly to look about . THE GREEK WOMAN Any chariots ? Or gods falling in fire ? MARIUS The centurion sometimes passes this way to check on me . I thought I heard the jingle of iron . THE GREEK WOMAN There 's no one . MARIUS And twice Herod Antipas has been here in the night  --  in a quilted gown and straw sandals , slopping along like a market-woman . I knew his yellow face from seeing it on his shekels . THE GREEK WOMAN He 's in Galilee . You would n't see Herod here . MARIUS Oh , he comes down to spend a night in Jerusalem , and watch the procurator and myself . He 's serious about this game of " Look , here comes the Messiah ! " I 've been posted three different places watching for that mule 's egg of his to hatch . I stood guard for three months on the road from Egypt  --  then for half a year I stayed awake nights pacing back and forth across an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning . And no matter where you 're stationed you 're likely to see him , shuffling by in the dark , alone always , and peering back as he goes to make sure you 're there . p. 5 THE GREEK WOMAN RisingWhat are you supposed to do if you catch a Messiah ? MARIUS Well , an intelligent soldier destroys the enemy upon contact ; I 'm an intelligent soldier  --  you follow me ? THE GREEK WOMAN But suppose he comes from the sky with an army ? MARIUS Well , who wants to suppose a thing like that ? Look , the last light 's gone out in the governor 's palace . The Sadducees and the robbers and the kings are all in bed beside their women . Sit here a minute . They sit down together . THE GREEK WOMAN Wait ! I think I heard  --  I thought there was something . She rises , points out left , and runs into the Temple at the right . MARIUS rises , looks out left , and resumes his pacing . Not till after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come half-way back , does HEROD ANTIPAS slip out of the shadow at the left and stand watching him . HEROD is a middle-aged man , wearing gown and slippers , and some kind of skull-cap for sleeping . He stands staring at MARIUS , who turns at the Temple steps and sees him . For a space they are motionless , then HEROD turns slowly and goes out . MARIUS stands transfixed . The WOMAN emerges from the Temple. p. 6 MARIUS Not turningStay where you were ! Go in ! We came within a hand's-breadth of it , mouse . They say he burns them hollow with a hot iron when he catches them with women . Go in , and be quiet . He 's climbing down the path . CURTAIN p. 7 Act 1 , Scene 2 Act OneSCENE II SCENE &amp; &amp; The roof of the palace of HEROD ANTIPAS in Tiberias , Galilee . It is surrounded by low white walls , and looks out over the sleeping city . It is night . HEROD sits on the wall at the rear , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THE SOOTHSAYER It is now understood that each man has his star , and as this star moves in the heavens so will the man 's life prosper . By his birth in time his star is known , by the water drop that falls when the midwife takes his head in her two hands and brings him forth to earth . HEROD My star is known ? THE SOOTHSAYER To me only . HEROD Tell me which is mine . THE SOOTHSAYER Just before daybreak it rises over the lake . At this time of year dawn is your best hour . HEROD I shall remember that . Go on . THE SOOTHSAYER But first , your Highness , is there any truth you would not wish to hear ? HEROD What kind of truth ? THE SOOTHSAYER The length of life , the threat of evil fortune to be avoided  --  p. 8 HEROD If it can be avoided tell me then . Yes , tell me all of it . Only if it should be my death comes soon  --  spare me that . THE SOOTHSAYER You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HEROD I shall outlive them , and they shall die old . Yes ? MIRA , the first wife of HEROD , enters silently , and stands looking off to the right . THE SOOTHSAYER Your star has been attacked , and will be attacked again . A comet returning every twelve years , fights against your star , attempts to shatter it , to dull it , to drag it from its course . It was this comet that burned over Bethlehem twelve years ago and triumphed over your star a single night ; but that ended well , your father executing the children born that year in Bethlehem , who would have endangered you . But now the twelfth year comes round again . The comet will return and you must beware . HEROD Beware of what ? THE SOOTHSAYER Whatever threatened you then , threatens you now again . HEROD The star of the Messiah . THE SOOTHSAYER It may have been . I know nothing of that . HEROD But if my father slew the Messiah , among those born that year in Bethlehem-then there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 9 THE SOOTHSAYER I can only say that if an adverse star returns to plague your guardian fire , then the evil was not killed but only countered  --  somehow warded off or frightened underground . HEROD If the star return . THE SOOTHSAYER And it may not appear . For three nights now I 've stared at the Constellation of the Serpent all night long , awaiting . It may be it will not return , for by my own reckoning it should have come and gone . HEROD How would you know it ? THE SOOTHSAYER Oh , it would brighten the sky like a chandelier let down among candles  --  HEROD He would be twelve years old if he were still alive . His age and birthplace are identifying marks that could be used in case a search was made . If this one is not found then perhaps all should die . Your pardon , Mira but if these are your Arab manners , you may keep them for your return to the desert ! This , ask you know , is my hour alone ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I have no wish to be angry ! MIRA Your saintly father , Herod the Great , made a great slaughter of children , a slaughter of the innocents , and made his name a horror among men , because he believed in some fantastic prophecy concerning the birth of this Messiah . p. 10 HEROD I know this . MIRA And remember it ? HEROD Yes . I hold it in my mind always  --  to take no step that will not look sane to others  --  to you , to myself , to anyone looking up from among the people , or from abroad , from Rome or Egypt . I shall give no order that might remind them of my father . MIRA No ? What do you contemplate ? HEROD This is the year of the census . From every part of Jsrael and Judea the tribes go up to Jerusalem in spring to attend the Passover . Once in so many years we set our enumerators at the gates and make our count for the tax rolls . It will be easy to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophesied . MIRA But this prophecy and your fear of it , and what action you may take to find out the Messiah  --  these are all irrational  --  HEROD You are not of our race ; you come from the desert  --  MIRA And I see you as you are ! HEROD I must find a way to make sure I 'm not endangered by a Messianic revolution ! At present I am in danger ! There 's a star crosses mine ! MIRA A star ! p. 11 HEROD And not only a star ! There 's a wind rising  --  and if it storms as it may there 'll be little left for any son of ours . MIRA But how are we threatened ? We 're at peace with the world . HEROD When a man 's a ruler he feels the tides and currents under him as a helmsman feels the sea . I keep a lookout.  --  The revolution of Judah washed clear up to the palace walls . The next wave may run higher . And what do the agitators cry , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth ? Listen and you can hear it  --  " The Messiah , the Messiah ! " You hear it in the back streets , in the shops , among men employed to dig the foundations of our palace here in Tiberias . It happens the palace site was pitched where an ancient Jewish cemetery had filled the ground with bones . And the workmen , piling the bones together , have a saying among themselves , " When the Messiah comes these bones will rise and tear Herod 's palace down ! " MIRA Then what you fear is only the Messiah ! HEROD I fear him only ! Whatever else God sends a man can meet and face it like a king ! But this seed of fire that slumbers among the old books , this will breed a kingship that I can not face and have no weapon for ! I must take him while he is young ! Before he knows his mission , before the people begin to turn to him ! If ten thousand die , if half my people die , and he die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! p. 12 MIRA Do you remember how once you woke me in the night to ask that if ever I saw signs of the old brain-sickness. your father died of , I should save you from it  --  shriek it out at you  --  have you beaten with whips , chill you with ice and burn you with fire , but somehow for our old love keep you sane  --  ? HEROD Yes , I remember  --  MIRA But now it 's upon you  --  this dread of the Messiah surrounds you like a dream  --  you never see me  --  see no one  --  see only maniacs  --  you will bring us all down together if you persist in this delusion ! HEROD turns to go , then comes back to her . HEROD Is it in my mind ? It can not be all in my mind . MIRA Yes , but it is ! HEROD That would be loathsome . To be like my father , To be as he was . And be watched  --  and know  --  and suspect that you 're mad  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the palm-courts and the baths , sunning themselves on a Sabbath afternoon , and looking about lest someone hear ? They say he 'll die as his father died , choking in the blood of children  --  they say Antipater 's gone mad with his father 's madness  --  that you see the Messiah rising out of the very steam of your morning bath , and scream for your attendants ! They say you search , as your father searched , for tokens and entrail-signs of this mythical Messiah who will descend to overthrow you  --  till the soldiers scoff in the barracks , and Caesar 's weary of you  --  till Caesar says , " Humor the madman . The Messianic worm kills quickly . Let him alone ! " And you are alone here with your seers and prophets , like a madman shut up with keepers ! p. 13 HEROD Oh , God of our fathers , reveal your truth to me ! Let the heavens speak or the voice from your whirlwind ! MIRA It was your misfortune to be with your father when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with living worms , and you saw the bright blood bubbling up in his throat from his many murders ! It will be my misfortune to watch you die as he died ! HEROD Take my hand , Mira , save me ! Keep me from that death ! A sudden flooding of light falls round them . THE SOOTHSAYER Your Highness , look toward the Constellation of the Serpent ! MIRA What is it ? What is this light ? THE SOOTHSAYER The comet has returned . HEROD Then the Messiah lives , and must be dealt with , and I was not mad ! Send for the praetor ! Quick , I shall give the order before his comet dims , and before my star has risen ! He claps his hands . To MIRA . Fool ! Fool of a woman ! It 's written in the stars the child still lives ! He must be found  --  and must die ! CURTAIN p. 14 Act 1 , Scene 3 Act OneSCENE III SCENE The interior of JOSEPH 'S house at Nazareth . The entrance is at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of carpenters ' tools and appliances hang or lie about . At the rear wall a long low carpenters ' bench has been set where it can be used for a seat . In the middle of the room , somewhat to the right , a curtain , half-drawn , divides the shop from the sleeping apartment . Just to the right of the curtain sits MIRIAM , weaving at a small hand-loom . JESHUA , a boy of twelve , is reading intently in a scroll . JOSEPH , the carpenter , sits astride a hurdle , working with a draw-knife on an oxbow . JACOB , a younger boy , is reciting a lesson for him . JOSEPH Will you say it again ? And remember the third reason has to do with something to eat . Think hard about that and it should be easier . JACOB " Tell me why this night should differ from all other nights of the year ? On other nights we may eat either leavened bread or unleavened , but tonight only the unleavened ; on other nights we may eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter herbs . On other nights  --  " He pauses . Why do we always leave an empty place at Passover ?  --  No , I know that 's not what I 'm to say , but why is one place left empty ? p. 15 JOSEPH That 's for Elias , if he should come , or for an angel , if an angel should come in  --  or for the Messiah . Or if none of these should come then for any stranger . JACOB But how would one know Elias or the angel if he came ? JOSEPH We might not know , and so anyone who enters is asked to sit at the vacant place .  --  But you have n't said the third reason .  --  JACOB " On other nights  --  " He pauses . Oh , but I know it perfectly well except for those two herbs  --  the names of those herbs run backward away from my mind  --  and as fast as I run they run faster so I never catch them  --  JOSEPH The time will come , my Jacob , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as the youngest it becomes your turn to open the Haggadah . Then you 'll be sorry you have n't listened and learned . JACOB But I do know it except for the words that run away ! MIRIAM Will you look at the oven once more , Jeshua , and tell me if the loaves are brown ? JESHUA Yes , Mother . JOSEPH Before you go and while I remember it , here are the silver pieces for the burnt offering . Each child must carry his portion of silver up to Jerusalem , and take care of it , and not lose it , for with that you must purchase the doves for sacrifice . He gives a coin to JACOB and then one to JESHUA. p. 16 JACOB I shall care for it . And thank you . JESHUA Yes , thank you , father . They start to go out . JACOB runs ahead of JESHUA . JACOB Turning at the doorThen came the butcher and killed the ox that drank the water that quenched the fire , that burned the stick that beat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father bought for two zuzim ! An only kid ! An only kid ! So you ca n't say I do n't know that ! He runs out . JESHUA He 'll know the rest , too , tomorrow . But he likes to tease you a little first . He goes out . JOSEPH How many loaves are you baking ? MIRIAM Only four to eat on the road . Did I hear you say there 's a great census at Jerusalem this year ? JOSEPH Yes . MIRIAM How is it taken ? JOSEPH The last time there was a row of scribes at the city gate writing at tables . And as each of us passed by they took down name and age and place of birth for the Roman tax rolls . MIRIAM Can you think what to say when we bring Jeshua to the gate ? p. 17 JOSEPH Well , no , I ca n't . It keeps coming back to bother me , but I never find an answer . It has always seemed the best thing was the truth . MIRIAM And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it possible a soldier would take him from us  --  and we 'd never hear what happened ?  --  and torture ourselves forever , thinking we might have saved him  --  wondering which dungeon of Herod 's he might lie in ?  --  or might be dead  --  or might be better dead ? JOSEPH Yes , yes , I know . MIRIAM In all Bethlehem and round about they say there are no boys twelve years old . If a lad came down this spring to Jerusalem , and told the scribes quite calmly , I was born in Bethlehem , my age is twelve  --  JOSEPH Then the scribe would say , without doubt , this is the child the first Herod overlooked  --  this is the child our Herod 's hunting for  --  this is the budding horn of the Messiah that must be nipped before it grows too tough for the Roman pincers . MIRIAM If it be true  --  what sometimes we have said  --  then it may be God cares for him  --  and yet  --  if it be true  --  perhaps our God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so precious . JOSEPH Could we speak to him ? Could we some way prepare him ? Tell him that this is only a doubtful guess  --  and yet it may be true  --  and he must therefore be wary in his answers ? p. 18 MIRIAM No , truly , Joseph  --  Whatever is in him he must find himself  --  Whatever he is to be  --  he must discover  --  We must never say it  --  never until he asks , I know this as if I were being warned to let him walk to the gate without taking thought . Yet if I were wrong , and he should tell his truth quite innocently , and never speak again  --  JOSEPH We shall be three days on the way to Jerusalem . Some thought may come before we 're at the gate . An emaciated BEGGAR , bent over and with a sack on his back , appears in the doorway . THE BEGGAR You 're Joseph of Nazareth ? JOSEPH Yes . THE BEGGAR I wo n't give my name , though you might know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had when I went into the hills . I 'm one of the few remaining culls left over from the revolution of Judah . There are thirty of us still hiding above on Mount Tabor . What we get to eat I leave you to imagine . We wo n't trouble you long , nor anyone . But whatever you have in the house that you were about to throw away  --  I 'll take it . A little mould or mildew would n't matter , and we 're used to worms in the meal . MIRIAM There 's half a loaf left over from our supper . p. 19 THE BEGGAR If it means you go hungry never mind it . They 'll get us before the year 's out , and whether it 's better to starve or rot on a cross we have n't decided yet . JOSEPH The revolution is seven years old . Are there still thirty men at large in the hills ? THE BEGGAR There are thousands , one place and another . But the fight 's gone out of us . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to stay , and the Romans are here to stay , at least for our time . And Judah 's dead , and we 're dying . He turns . If it 's true about the half loaf , let me have it . As MIRIAM fetches the bread the two BOYS re-enter . JOSEPH I only wish that it were more . THE BEGGAR You could give more , but why should you ? You could have fought when we fought , but why should you  --  because we lost . JOSEPH They rejected me from the phalanx . I was n't young enough . THE BEGGAR I was young enough . God knows I 'm old enough now . The greeting of God go with you for the half loaf . He goes out . JESHUA What man was that ? p. 20 JOSEPH We 're not a free people . Seventy years ago the Romans came this way , and since that time their governors have ruled our kings . Our high priests are appointed from Rome ; we pay a tax to Rome and another to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not free , and seven years ago a man named Judah led a revolt against the Roman census and the Roman tax . He 's dead now , and this man was one who followed him . Will follow him further , to the end of what can be done to a man . They are silent for a moment . MIRIAM Are the loaves ready ? JESHUA Not yet , I think , Mother . A VOICE is heard from beyond the door . THE VOICE Some of the most unappetizing people emerge from this residence . JOSEPH It 's Shadrach and the others . Come in , come in ! SHADRACH , a carpenter , enters with his wife , CASSIA . They are followed by two stone-masons , ZEBULON and JESSE , and their wives , REBA and ESTHER . SHADRACH carries a torch , which he puts out . SHADRACH There was a cabbage-green sort of bitten-off fellow , with a sack on his back that came out of here . Have you missed anything ? JOSEPH No , Shadrach , only a bit of bread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad name , if it allows gangrene beggars that smell like that .  --   --  Now any other color  --  but this squeamish-green ! MIRIAM Come in , all of you . CASSIA And do n't mind Shadrach ; he has a good heart . SHADRACH No , but that was a spoiled man ; he was mouldy ; he was on his way back into the substance from which we do n't admit we come  --  MIRIAM Sit here and rest , mother Reba . See , Cassia , we have new rush mats , so that all can sleep here tonight and start early in the morning . And the blessing of God on all of you , since Shadrach must break in without God 's blessing . She smiles at SHADRACH . REBA God 's greeting to the house . CASSIA AND ESTHER And to all here . The two MASONS mumble a pious word with them . SHADRACH Did I leave that out ? The truth is I 've been God's-greeting the wide world today and I want a place to sit down . The blessing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . ZEBULON We took to the road before noon . p. 22 JOSEPH Perhaps you 'll be too weary to start again in the morning . ZEBULON No , I think not . We 'll make it a three-day journey , and cool our feet in the river when we 're tired . JESSE When we were young Jerusalem was only two days ' away by the path along hither Jordan . Now , of course , even the young folks take three days to it . SHADRACH Yes , and why not ? It 's our one holiday . I work every day in the year , except holy days , and so does Cassia . But then when the spring comes round I begin to smell the Passover feast . That 's once we can forget about hammers and nails and prices and set off across country like young lovers . I tell you I 'm no strict believer  --  give me Ecclesiastes for my money  --  " Vanity of vanities , all is vanity , " there 's a prophet  --  of the making of many books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sawing of many boards , there 's no end  --  JOSEPH You were about to say something ? SHADRACH Yes , I was ! I was about to say man is of few days , and evil  --  he 's born to trouble as the sparks fly upward , and wherever he walks there 's a hollow place preparing in the ground to house him at the last  --  so let him have three days on the way to Jerusalem .  --  - It 's spring and the flowers are out in the desert . p. 23 MIRIAM I 'm always grateful that Passover comes in the spring when the desert lilies are at their best . There 's a kind of happiness in the temple courts ; one 's happy just to see the Sanhedrin , and to know that some men are wise and care for wisdom  --  but what one remembers most is sleeping open to the air , and singing as we did when we were children , then waking to find the Jordan suddenly , and turning inland and returning to find it again . JOSEPH We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this Ecclesiastes when he seems to be saying that nothing matters and there 's no God , and the life of man is wind . I wonder about Ecclesiastes . CASSIA And about Shadrach ? She touches SHADRACH 'S hair . JESSE Yes , about Shadrach , too . CASSIA Yes , I wonder about him . For a good husband and a good carpenter he has some remarkably sharp things to say about man 's evil days . SHADRACH Few and evil . All too few to spend with so lovely a woman . He puts an arm around her . MIRIAM I must look at my loaves . I 'm baking for the journey . p. 24 CASSIA I 'll go with you . MIRIAM And since we start early , perhaps you should choose your own pallets where you 'll sleep . Mother Reba will have my bed , if she does n't mind  --  REBA No , girl  --  I 'm for the floor with the younger pilgrims . MIRIAM , CASSIA and ESTHER go out . A Roman CENTURION appears in the entrance . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so I 'm told ? JOSEPH You wish to see me ? THE CENTURION AffablyYou 're a fine set of treasonous heathen , you are , live down here among rocks and ditches , where a Roman ca n't find his way even by daylight . I think you do it to make soldiers break their necks . JOSEPH We hardly know there are stones and ditches , we 're so used to them . THE CENTURION Well , forget about that . I came on another matter . You 're a carpenter , and now I see you have guests , and they 're carpenters and masons . I 'm here about the palace at Tiberias  --  Herod 's new palace , and the work on it . When I saw you last at the market I told you we 'd need carpenters and masons to work there in the spring . Well , now it 's spring , and we have n't seen you . A female devil take those rocks ! - They 've cut a strap in two ! He works at his sandal. p. 25 JOSEPH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival and we shall all be in Jerusalem . THE CENTURION I know , and I have my orders not to interfere with a Jewish festival . That 's understood between Herod and the governor and whoever else makes out the edicts . But I 'm also told to damn well get the palace built , and get the men to do it . And the men are n't there . And I 'm here , as you may have noticed , and my neck 's not broken so far . JOSEPH Is it not understood also , that a workman may pick and choose among the tasks that offer , thinking of the wage , and whether the overseers are of his race , and the distance from his home ? THE CENTURION There 's no wage better . We 're authorized to pay the best wage there is . And as for the overseers , I 'll make you one with your own men under you . You 're known around for an honest man , and we 'll trust you . JOSEPH Let me think and give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not through your scarps and outworks . Answer me now . Will you come when you 're through with your Passover ? SHADRACH If you 'll forgive me I think the Centurion should be told the reason why we avoid Herod 's palace , and prefer not to work on it . p. 26 THE CENTURION Why ? JOSEPH Have you never heard that Herod 's new palace in Tiberias is built on the oldest Jewish graveyard known in Galilee ? Our fathers were buried there , yet I 've seen the bones of Jewish patriarchs corded up by the workmen in long rows out in the sun and rain ! THE CENTURION Well , Herod 's your man , not ours ! JOSEPH And not ours ! He 's no Jew , and would n't stay long where he is without a Roman guard behind him and Caesar reaching from Rome ! THE CENTURION Oh , Mother of Hermes , are we so touchy about our father 's bones ? You 'd better take more care of the living skin that grows on your backs !

He acted as my helper . THE CENTURION Let him stand , too . JESHUA ranges himself with the others . When you 've had your holiday , and taken your time about it , as you will , no doubt , you 'll come to work on Herod 's palace , and I 'll hold you responsible for the others . Bring your son . p. 27 JOSEPH He 's still at school . THE CENTURION Bring him anyway . I 'm being tender with you , my dear Joseph . The only question is  --  will you say yes to a pleasant man like me , or must they send another less pleasant ? You 'll have to answer now because I 'm short of time .

THE CENTURION Curses wo n't hurt . The empire stands on curses , and I 've stept on a number of cursing mouths myself . No Roman dies of the evil eye . MIRIAM But let them answer after the Passover . Maybe some mind will change . Let us not run after evil . Let us meet it when it has caught up with us . THE CENTURION You Jews go out to meet it , and drag it in with you . He sees the loaves . Speaking of bread , somebody gave half a loaf to one of Judah 's outlaws  --  a known rebel . We took it from him and here it is . He pulls a sack from under his arm .

ZEBULON There was a shadow moving among the rocks ; he may be taking a look about . p. 30 JESSE Alone ? He should have carried a light . ZEBULON Surely no wild beast would come so close to our fire . JOSEPH I 'll walk out that way . I think I hear him . He steps out left . JESSE There were voices along the river earlier in the evening . By this time a number have risen and look out to the left . JACOB Is it true there are lions in the desert , Mother ? MIRIAM No , not here , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerusalem city . On the other side of the river there may be lions . JACOB And leopards ? MIRIAM Yes , leopards , too . JACOB Do n't you remember in the book of Kings there were lions this side of the Jordan ? MIRIAM Yes , long ago , there may have been then . JACOB I think there are lions here . He sits up . I really think so . It 's not such a wide river . They could come right across . JESHUA Did I ever tell you the story of the lion who would n't get his feet wet ? p. 31 JACOB No . JESHUA Once there was a lion who lived alone in the trans-Jordan country . He lived quite well there on the other side of the river , and ate nearly every day . But then there came a season when all things failed on his side of the river . JACOB lies back to listen . He could n't find anything , not even a cony among the rocks , and so every day he sat empty and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry , and looked at his paws and licked them , and cried . And he said to himself , " This hunger is a terrible thing ; it 's a thing stronger than lions , because it 's stronger than I am . " Then he set one paw in the shallow of the river , and said , " This water is an ancient enemy , and I dislike it , but I must cross the river , and taste the sheep on the hills of hither-Jordan . " Then he shook his paw , like this , to shake the water from it , and roared , and put in another foot , and snarled , and said , " This hunger is stronger than I am , but I am stronger than water ! " and at that he jumped straight in and beat the river with his paws , and choked , and jumped out again . Then the lion said . " It seems I was mistaken . A great lion like myself is stronger than hunger . I 'm not hungry at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked very fierce , but the trouble really was he was afraid of water . And from that day there are no lions on this side . p. 32 JACOB But did n't he ever get anything to eat ? JESHUA Yes , after a while  --  in the rainy season . But no matter how hungry he was he never swam the river . JOSEPH returns from the left . JOSEPH He 's not that way . I think he 's walked on up the valley . CASSIA CallingShadrach ! ESTHER Is n't there a fire ? I saw the flash of a fire . She looks out to the right . ZEBULON Yes , and that 's where he 's gone . There 's another encampment like our own . REBA Then what was the need to frighten the women and children ? My legs give way and bend all the way down , like a pair of tallow candles in a warm house . JESSE Yes , I do see a fire , and someone coming this way . ZEBULON This will be Shadrach . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Entering from the rightWe must put out our fire and move our camp toward the path along the river . Gather your things ! Quick , Cassia ! Quick , all of you  --  and the children  --  we 'll find another place ! p. 33 CASSIA But why , Shadrach ? SHADRACH Never mind  --  only we move . JESSE What have you seen ? The company stirs itself to move . SHADRACH It was n't so much what I saw as what I heard . A nest of wild men warming their hands around a fire and estimating gravely what we 're worth in gold or silver  --  or hides . I 've heard of these naked and hairy bandits in the hills , but these are hairier than I expected . Come , if our fire 's out , and we 've vanished , they 'll give up and turn on somebody else . JACOB Maybe they 're lions . SHADRACH No , they 're not lions . They 're men , but not of the sort I want to talk with . As he speaks , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him . He turns , and two or three other BANDITS enter . Some carry weapons , some staves . ISHMAEL The ist BANDITYou are on your way to the holy city ? SHADRACH Yes . ISHMAEL How many of you ? JOSEPH Ten . ISHMAEL Do you bear offerings ? p. 34 JOSEPH No . ISHMAEL Have you money to pay for offerings ? They are silent . Answer as if you stood in the presence of your God , for you are held responsible in your answers . JOSEPH There is no one here who knows what the others have . What little we carry in silver or copper coins we took with us to buy our sacrifices . ISHMAEL And do you not know that whatever you buy in the temple courts yields profit to Hanan the high priest , and that Hanan paid for his place , giving money to Herod , and Herod in turn bought his seat from Augustus ? Is it worship of God that pays tribute to Rome ? JOSEPH Sir , we have heard these things , or guessed at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family must worship , and in all the sacred books there is no door open for access unto God , save the rites of the temple , and the high priest of our people . If these be corrupt are we corrupted , worshipping ? And if so , should we then shut ourselves from God entirely , and eat as the beast eats , without thought or thanks for Him who made him ? ISHMAEL How can I answer you , you who have forgotten Judah ? How can I answer you who bow your necks to the oxbow and plow for Herod and reap for Caesar ? Who pour out money for burnt offering on a captured altar , and think God is pleased ? You and those with you have betrayed your God , as , when Judah was dying , you betrayed him , sending no succor to him ! p. 35 THE ROBBER The men will come forward and give over what money they have . ISHMAEL Then if afterward you are searched and money is found on a man , then by Jehovah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nailed to the desert floor with thorn-sticks sharpened in fire ! JOSEPH Will you tell me your name ? ISHMAEL They call me Ishmael because my hand is raised against every tribe that sends up tribute to Rome ! JOSEPH We must pay them quietly , Shadrach , for these men are armed , and we are not . He detaches a purse from his girdle and surrenders it . SHADRACH Very well . He also pays , followed by JESSE and ZEBULON . JOSEPH Were you a follower of Judah ? ISHMAEL Yes . JOSEPH And did Judah hold it righteous to rob pilgrims in the desert ? ISHMAEL No , but the days have made it righteous ! JOSEPH And are you a prophet , to say what is righteous ? ISHMAEL Come up into the hills with me , you who travel easily to Jerusalem ! Come into the hills , and I will show you the men who followed Judah ; how some of them are sick and there is no physician , how some of them are stricken with the sun and some with hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and day and night , when the noon is fire , or the darkness falls like a winter , there are always the Romans , the Romans out of their camps , with metal shields before them , and short swords thrusting at the belly ! This is our life . And you are soft and have not helped us . You will help now a little . Against your will . p. 36 JOSEPH But even if this is true , could I not say , " Lo , I am a poor man , and my neighbor is rich ; I will go to my neighbor and take from him lest my child hunger tomorrow ? " ISHMAEL Would you hear what Judah said when he was dying ? This was the message of Judah . " The Messiah is born who will conquer the Romans ! His star has been seen , and he lives , and he will deliver us ! Whether he come in fire , with wings of iron , or with chariots over the earth , whether he come with thousands or alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Messiah , and keep watch , and you who are called Ishmael , keep you my men , this little remnant , keep them and live in hope ; for the old law has been broken like tablets of glass , and shall bind you under no more ! And no man ever again shall loose or bind save the Messiah , who now lives among you , and has not spoken , but will speak , and burn out the hearts of over-lords , and wither kingships  --  till there 's neither procurator nor tax nor Caesar left above you ! " This said Judah when he was dying , and he died above in the hills of an old wound . And we wait here for the Messiah , even robbers , even sleepers in the rain , but doing the will of God ! SHADRACH It wo n't help to argue with a madman , Joseph , and these folks are plainly mad . ZEBULON Yes , they are mad . p. 37 JOSEPH Then the Messiah lives ? ISHMAEL This too was promised me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the Messiah , though he should never see him . Now I am dying too , for I have a mortal lesion , and can live but a few days . Yet I shall see him , for this was prophesied .  --  But go to Jerusalem ! As the Jordan runs to Bahr Lut  --  to the Dead Sea , go down to that sink which is called Jerusalem ! Worship a shame-faced god at his dirtied altar ! Kneel down in the courts where kneeling is at a price , and harken to Pharisees ! But remember , rising , that you have fed for a day those who kneel among rocks , who worship a free God freely , and await that which is promised , and will come ! He turns to go . JESHUA Ishmael ! JESSE Be quiet , and let him go . ISHMAEL Did someone call me ? SHADRACH No ! These are insane men , Jeshua , and criminals ; let them go if they will . JESHUA Will you take my silver ? ISHMAEL Who was it called me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come penniless to my brother 's house . JESHUA I should like to give him my silver , Mother . p. 38 SHADRACH Well , now that they know he has it  --  He shrugs and turns away . JESHUA crosses to ISHMAEL and offers him the coin . ISHMAEL You give this freely ? JESHUA Yes , freely . ISHMAEL You are not frightened ? JESHUA No , not frightened . But I can not give it unless you put out your hand  --  and I wish to give it . ISHMAEL What is your name ? JESHUA Jeshua . ISHMAEL And how old are you ? JESHUA Twelve . ISHMAEL And where were you born ? JESHUA In Bethlehem . ISHMAEL takes the silver . ISHMAEL Let me see your face . Now blessed be the God of Judah , who has let me live to this hour .  --   --  Give back what we have taken , for this is a holy company . And go quickly into the hills , and bring news there we are gone to Jerusalem  --  for our waiting nears an end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 2nd ROBBER restores the money to JOSEPH , and goes out . Lie down and rest , and we will guard you . Yes , many more will come from the hills to guard you . I keep only this silver penny , as earnest of the kingdom . p. 39 JESHUA Coming down to his FATHER and MOTHERWhy does he look at me ? SHADRACH Tapping his foreheadHe 's touched . They 're all touched , But they have their uses . JOSEPH There was some kind of magic in your gift of silver . MIRIAM It 's not a usual thing that they receive alms . ZEBULON What does this mean to you ? JESSE I gather one thing : They 've given the money back . SHADRACH And they 're setting a guard . ZEBULON But these are robbers and desperate men . Do we dare lie down and close our eyes and let them guard us ? SHADRACH I shall lie down , because I 'm tired . Besides , what else can we do ? JESSE Well , sleep well , Shadrach . SHADRACH Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soundest guarded by robbers . CURTAIN p. 40 Act 1 , Scene 5 Act OneSCENE V SCENE Evening before the city gates of Jerusalem . A SCRIBE sits writing at a small table ; a line of people is forming to the right . The party that we know has arrived and is now answering . MARIUS , who has been posted at the gate , approaches to listen . JESHUA has perched on a-rock at the rear , and reads a scroll . A WOMAN passes the group and enters the gates . She carries bird cages on her back . THE DOVE WOMAN Buy my pigeons and doves ! Buy my white doves ! Buy my pigeons and doves ! Buy my white doves ! THE SCRIBE To REBAYour birthplace ? REBA Capernaum . THE SCRIBE Your age ? REBA Sixty-five . He nods to her . She passes on . JESSE comes next to the table . MIRIAM and JOSEPH sit on a stone a little forward from the others . JOSEPH The soldier has come out from the gate . MIRIAM Yes . He listens . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath fails me  --  and my heart . Shall we go back ? Shall we turn and not stay for the Passover ? p. 41 JOSEPH But all eyes would be upon us  --  and those who thought no harm of us might then wonder why we had been afraid . THE SCRIBE AngryMust you mumble your words down toward the earth ? JESSE Sir ? THE SCRIBE To MARIUSGod pity the census-taker . Humanity poured over him like a vomit ; the infirmity of age , the noses and rears of inarticulate children , the  --  MARIUS It 's a long day here from sun-up to sun-down and your pen gets worn down like your patience  --  THE SCRIBE Well , pass on . I think I have it . MARIUS The porter 's coming now to close the gates . THE SCRIBE Jesse , the son of Kerith , living in Nazareth , sixty-nine years old , a mason . JESSE Yes , sir . THE SCRIBE Looking at JACOB , who is in line behind JESSE . Is this your son ? JESSE Why , no , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 42 THE SCRIBE Are you his guardian ? JESSE No . THE SCRIBE Then why does he come pushing in behind you ? Who 's with you ? JACOB I can answer for myself . I 'm Jacob , the son of the judge , Gennesareth , I was born in Jerusalem , and I live there ; see  --  I 'm here with my kinsman Joseph . MARIUS Ask his age . THE SCRIBE Your age ? JACOB Ten years old . THE SCRIBE To JOSEPHThis boy is with you ? JOSEPH Yes . THE SCRIBE These answers are correct ? JOSEPH Yes . Quite correct . THE SCRIBE Pass in , then . And hurry . The sun has touched the hill , thank God , and the gates will soon be closing . Come , your name ? SHADRACH steps before the table . JESHUA continues to read obliviously . SHADRACH Shadrach of Nazareth , a carpenter . JOSEPH We ca n't leave now . MIRIAM No . JOSEPH The soldier wished to know Jacob 's age . It would have been better to hide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out toward Phoenicia . To have kept no feasts , and lived only to guard him from them . p. 43 MIRIAM Let us leave now , Joseph . Jacob will enter the city with the others , but you and I and Jeshua must turn back . and find our way home . I feel it strongly  --  we must  --  no matter what may be said  --  JOSEPH Yes , I feel it strongly  --  and yet I ask too why there 's been no sign if there was danger . MIRIAM We are lost now if we pause ! Come , we will turn together , and , if they call , we will not enter still , but give quite different names and be seen no more at Nazareth , be seen no more in any city  --  JOSEPH I fear even that may be fatal now . They look at us under brows and wait for us  --  They turn to take their places before the SCRIBE . At this moment ISHMAEL and the 2nd ROBBER enter and take their places at the table where Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your name ? ISHMAEL Ishmael . THE SCRIBE And occupation ? ISHMAEL I gather desert honey , and parch grain over the fire , and study God 's word . THE SCRIBE That 's three occupations . And none recognized . Will you give me one that I can write down here as a livelihood among civilized men ? p. 44 ISHMAEL I will .  --  I study God 's word . THE SCRIBE And are you paid for that ? ISHMAEL I 'm paid in the words of God , and in understanding of His words . Are any paid better ? THE SCRIBE Looking up at him , then smothering his angerLet it go . Where do you live ? ISHMAEL In Bethbara , in the desert of the Salt Sea . I have my brother with me , and my son . My brother , who stands behind me , is deaf and dumb , and can not speak for himself . His name is Dark , and we are the sons of Rabbath . The SCRIBE writes . THE SCRIBE And your own son , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scroll , the lad there yonder . JESHUA looks up and listens . THE SCRIBE And his name ? ISHMAEL Jeshua . THE SCRIBE And where was he born ? ISHMAEL Sir , on the slopes of Mount Nebo where his mother was tending flock . In no city and no town but desert born . MARIUS Who has taught him to read ? p. 45 ISHMAEL I taught him to read . He reads the word of God . THE SCRIBE What is his age ? ISHMAEL He is thirteen years old . JESHUA gets down and crosses to MIRIAM , who puts her finger to her lips . MIRIAM Say nothing , and go with him . THE SCRIBE And now if you 'll kindly pull all your wits together in an effort to make sense , we 'll have a last try at your occupation . Something must be set down as the thing you do .  --  ISHMAEL I have told you I gather honey and parch corn over the fire , and study God 's word ! THE SCRIBE Are you paid for any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when you need money for taxes , and all men born pay taxes , where do you get it ? ISHMAEL You may set down that I sell the honey . THE SCRIBE Well , I will set it down , but the desert north of Nebo is full of robbers and I have no doubt you 're among them , both of you , if the truth were known . ISHMAEL And Jerusalem , your city , is full of robbers , and that truth is known , full of scribes and Levites and Pharisees and Sadducees , sucking the very gristle from children 's bones , to make profit of gold and silver for Herod and his Arabian wife ! p. 46 THE SCRIBE Very well  --  but I say you 're a robber , as most of them are robbers across the Jordan , and ripe for crucifixion , and they 'll get you before you 're through ! ISHMAEL But first the scribes and Levites  --  and the ravenous house of Hanan  --  God will see them hung up first ! THE SCRIBE As you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JESHUAGo in with your father . JESHUA follows Ishmael . Jeshua ! JESHUA Yes ? THE SCRIBE That is your name ? Jeshua ? JESHUA Yes . THE SCRIBE What is it you read ? JESHUA This scroll ? The book of Isaiah . Only these latter chapters of Isaiah were written by an Unknown Prophet , of whom the name even has been lost . THE SCRIBE And what does it say in the book ? JESHUA Here where I read it says that the earth was better at one time , and will be again . THE SCRIBE Do you believe that ? JESHUA Yes , I believe it . THE SCRIBE Go in . JESHUA goes in . JOSEPH and MIRIAM come to the table. p. 47 THE SCRIBE Yes ? JOSEPH Joseph of Nazareth , a carpenter , and his wife Miriam . THE SCRIBE There 's a boy with you named Jacob , who went in before you ? JOSEPH Yes . THE SCRIBE WritingGo in then . The porter may close the gates . The sun went down some time ago . JOSEPH and MIRIAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARIUS We shall have the old fox Herod here tomorrow , and we 've caught nothing yet . THE SCRIBE No . MARIUS This last lad  --  you called him to make him turn  --  for a look at his face ? THE SCRIBE To make him answer his name  --  and say what he was reading . MARIUS He was reading Isaiah , Whatever Isaiah is . THE SCRIBE It 's a holy book . Quite holy enough to make him the madman 's son . MARIUS To the PORTERLet us through before it 's locked , boy . Wait , let us through . We 're too old to pile over it . They go in. @x SCENE An inner room of the Temple , used for the meetings of the Sanhedrin . The session is over for the day , but a few members linger to discuss an unfinished question . GENNESARETH We are all friends of the high priest  --  or must seem to be his friends . Our seats in the Sanhedrin would soon be filled with others if we dared dispute his policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have you turned suddenly by chance and seen the curious eyes upon you there in the crowd ? Eyes that say , " This is a priest , and I should reverence him , " but which also say , " This man serves under Hanan , and Hanan serves under Herod , and all three stand together between my God and me . How can reverence to them be reverence to my God ? " You have seen this question in people 's eyes  --  and you have wondered , too , " Do we serve God or do we serve corruption , here in the temple ? " MALACHI Only people who are free may serve God as they please . GENNESARETH Then when will our day of deliverance come ? How long will our God be kept a prisoner at His own altar  --  and we His jailors , paid to betray Him in Silence ? ABBAS A visitor . The high priest Hanan . HANAN enters p. 49 HANAN Forgive me , gentlemen . I asked you to wait after the others were gone , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herod , a message and a commission . You are men of the spirit and he of the flesh  --  or such is his word to you  --  and there are matters wherein he is blind though you may be able to see . Among these matters is that of the Messiah 's coming . This has been foretold by seers you study hourly , and when this prophecy has come to pass it will be those attuned to it in mind who will first know  --  who will feel the first faint trembling of earth beneath the footstep of its king and be aware of him . And your commission from Herod is only this  --  when you first know or first suspect his presence in our midst  --  it is his wish that you will send this news through me to him . Or directly if you will . For Herod and myself wish to do him honor and submit ourselves to his kingdom .  --  I come to ask for Herod  --  as from himself  --  if this magic news should touch you , will you come first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABBAS If it comes to us you shall hear , lord Hanan . CHORAZIM And if this revelation should come to you , a much more likely thing , you being the high priest and the friend of God , will you not share it with us then , so that we may worship with you ? p. 50 HANAN You have my word for that , if God should favor me . CHORAZIM Thank you , my lord . HANAN Also  --  I hope you have not mistaken Herod  --  he is a mystic and a dreamer of dreams , but his dreams are the same as yours . Until tomorrow . He goes out . CHORAZIM Yes , my lord . GENNESARETH The adder in the nest ! A snake could argue quite as plausibly that he means to worship the bird ! ABBAS But do you think so ? GENNESARETH This welcome prepared  --  ABBAS Yes  --  ? GENNESARETH Is a quiet murder . And what he asks is that we join with him in a conspiracy to destroy the Messiah ! MALACHI Come ! Come , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of our state against what might be called the flowering of our race . They and all of us would gain by that flowering . CHORAZIM You refer , I believe to the Messiah as a flower ? MALACHI I do . CHORAZIM Perhaps another metaphor were more apt . Suppose he 's planted like an acorn in a jar , which grows and spreads his roots and must become a tree if he 's to live . And then suppose that we 're the pottery that hems him in and must be shattered when his swelling roots reach out for earth . p. 51 GENNESARETH But obviously , Chorazim , we can not let self-interest affect us in such a matter . Who values the clay pot if by its breaking this eternal oak is set in our soil to flourish forever ? MALACHI I value my clay pot . And Herod values his , and Hanan his , more than any oak or acorn . GENNESARETH But think what you say ! You 'd let them murder him and make no outcry  --  CHORAZIM Come , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  GENNESARETH Is it stronger than death ? For that 's what they mean ! Death ! ABBAS But think what you say , Gennesareth ! Suppose a Messiah comes and the high priest does not welcome him , but finds him worthy of death  --  are we not bound to believe that he is worthy of death  --  that he is not the true Messiah ? GENNESARETH If there were grave doubt , perhaps  --  But any child or man who appeared and seemed to be the Messiah , they would seek his death ! Whether he were doubtful or not ! ABBAS Would there not be doubt always ? What test have we for the true Messiah ? None . None generally accepted . GENNESARETH Would you then  --  if the Messiah were to stand before us  --  if he came here  --  and revealed himself  --  would you  --  report his presence to Hanan ? p. 52 CHORAZIM There is none among us , my dear Gennesareth , who would care to have it said , " The Messiah passed this way , and spoke to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never knew him . " GENNESARETH Which means if he came , you would betray him ! ABBAS Come , again , the word again  --  the word is strong  --  betray  --  why should we say betray ? Let us say announce , for that is our meaning . If the Messiah comes I shall announce him gladly . CHORAZIM Yet he will not come  --  he will not come  --  Be sure of that  --  the question will not arise . The children of Israel are fools to hope for him and the high priest and the king are fools to fear him  --  for he will not come . JESHUA enters behind them . GENNESARETH There are passages as early as the pentateuch of Moses that can not be interpreted except as the promise of his coming ! CHORAZIM It is promised , yes . And so we wait for it . Meanwhile the Romans govern us as they like , and pick our pockets with ease , because we 're watching the gates of Heaven for the coming of a god ! MALACHI My theory is  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that we are watched ? p. 53 GENNESARETH This is Jeshua , the son of my cousin Joseph of Nazareth , who stays with me during Passover at my house . To JeshuaHow did you come here ? JESHUA I was walking here among the columns , and thought I was alone till I heard your voices  --  You will forgive me ? MALACHI ContinuingMy theory is that we of this generation shall not see the Messiah because he has come and gone . Two centuries have passed since Judas Maccabaeus marched to Jerusalem , expelling the foreign legions that had conquered us . Could not our Maccabaeus have been the Messiah ? He fulfilled the conditions . I think he was the Messiah , and that we shall see no other . JESHUA But  --  Judas Maccabaeus could not have been the Messiah ! CHORAZIM No ?  --  then why not ? Your kinsman 's son has opinions of his own . JESHUA I 'm sorry . I spoke without thinking . I had forgotten  --  this is the court of the Sanhedrin  --  GENNESARETH It is indeed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know . He turns to go. p. 54 MALACHI And yet I should like to know why your cousin 's son should say so passionately that Maccabaeus could not have been the Messiah . For myself , I can not see why not . GENNESARETH Stay , Jeshua  --  stay and answer . JESHUA But you can answer this . You could all answer better than I. CHORAZIM No , truly , we have no answer . JESHUA We know the works of men can be undone . We know that Maccabaeus once set us free , but we were conquered again . If Maccabaeus had been sent of God we should still be free , for the works of God can not be undone . ABBAS It 's a shrewd answer . CHORAZIM Yes . Yes , he has a certain logic which is not bad . ABBAS He lives in Galilee . MALACHI Let 's not despise the country . As you know it 's the shepherd boys come fresh from off the hills who prosper in Jerusalem . You learned this from your father , Jeshua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things , from him , but , I think not this . Is n't it a plain meaning ? It came to me  --  if the Messiah stood on earth , alone , and found himself a man , expecting no help from God , he could not have much hope . He could have no hope at all . p. 55 CHORAZIM I do n't follow you . You 're too abstruse for me . JESHUA If it were given to you to be the Messiah , and you stood here in this room , and looked out over the earth , and saw our poverty of men and things , and knew that we were a pathway for the empires that lie to east and west  --  would you have courage even to begin ? CHORAZIM But I am not the Messiah . JESHUA If he were a man , and without the help of God , he would be much like you . CHORAZIM SmilingAh , a shrewd thrust ! The country boy strikes home ! Take him off , someone , because he bites and scratches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled the wise men time out of mind  --  When the Messiah comes will he descend from heaven or be born , a man among men , here on our earth ? JESHUA He will be born among men . ABBAS SmilingYou see ! He knows ! MALACHI Now you must have some reason  --  some weighty reason for this answer ? JESHUA Yes.I have a reason . MALACHI Give it , sir . We await you . p. 56 JESHUA It 's written that he 's to come of the line of David , and David was a man . MALACHI A casuist  --  He throws up his hands in mock despair. an absolutist and a casuist  --  I must admit that David was a man , and according to the prophet the Messiah will come of the line of David . Some country priest has worked these riddles out , brooding alone over his crust of shew-bread and the Torah , and schooled the boy in his answers . ABBAS But now I think you 've stepped into difficulties , Jeshua . The work of Maccabaeus was undone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore not the Messiah . But you also say the Messiah will be a man . JESHUA With the help of God . A man with the help of God . ABBAS Is that so different ? JESHUA Is n't it all the difference in the world ? ABBAS Yes , if a man were ever sure he had it  --  it might be . JESHUA But a man would know if he had it . ABBAS You think he would ? JESHUA If God should speak to a man the man would know . CHORAZIM I think when you grow up you 'll be among us here in the Sanhedrin  --  But answer one last question : How will you know the Messiah when he comes ? p. 57 MALACHI Yes , how shall we know him ? Answer that , Jeshua . JESHUA By his victories . By his great victories . And by the immortal army from the sky that fights beneath his banner . ABBAS Oh , God will send an army ! JESHUA He must . MALACHI Is there any prophecy regarding such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could our little handful of tribes win against Rome unless God sent us help out of his Heaven ? If there 's to be a Messiah God must help him ! CHORAZIM Meanwhile , we 've wandered far from our last question : How shall we know the Messiah when he appears ? Instead of your vague answer were it not better to put those facts together which the prophecies reveal ? It 's true , as you say , he 's to come of the line of David . His birthplace , too , has been predicted . No doubt you know it ? JESHUA No . CHORAZIM You can not name his birthplace ? JESHUA No . MALACHI There are gaps , my scholar , in your erudition . The place is named in a passage which you must have studied  --  the fourth chapter of Micah .

CHORAZIM To GENNESARETHYes , we must go . But bring your kinsman up to Jerusalem when he 's of an age to come . MALACHI Yes , bring him when he 's older , Gennesareth . ABBAS and MALACHI go out . GENNESARETH Would you care to be one of us , Jeshua , when you are older ? JESHUA To be with you here ? Yes , and yet  --  if God dwells here , should one not feel his presence even in passing by ? GENNESARETH You have n't felt it here in the Temple ? JESHUA With self-reproachNo . CHORAZIM Not in this room ? JESHUA No . Least of all here in this room .

CURTAIN p. 59 Act 2 , Scene 2 Act TwoSCENE II SCENE Before the Temple at Jerusalem . It is toward evening but the court and the steps are still busy with activities associated with the Passover . The GREEK WOMAN is selling jewelry , and her neck and arms are loaded with bangles . The DOVE WOMAN is offering doves to passers-by , two MONEY-CHANGERS have set up shop on the steps , a MATZOH-SELLER is seated on a step , and a FRUIT-SELLER has spread his wares for sale . A PHARISEE stands behind them in silent prayer . JESSE , REBA , ZEBULON , SHADRACH and CASSIA enter and stand in a group below the Temple steps . THE DOVE WOMAN Buy my pigeons and doves !

One per cent of all amounts above one aureus , and below that , two per cent . My competitor deducts an indefinite and exorbitant fee which you feel though you do not see it ! THE 1ST MONEY CHANGER If you are wise you will disbelieve the slanderous attack of my associate at the next table , a man of criminal record , the son of an Arab pirate and a Phoenician strumpet , whose practice it is to extract full fifty per cent of all he touches and swear that he took but one !

CASSIA Yes . Yes , I would . SHADRACH You do n't need to be hung around with gewgaws ; You 're still pretty without them . CASSIA I know how it is . When you 're young you 're handsome enough without jewels  --  and when you 're old nobody will buy them for you . SHADRACH I think the Pharisee 's about to pray . He 's flapping his wings . Watch !

MARIUS , the soldier , enters . MARIUS The Tetrarch Herod has ordered a distribution of alms ! On the first day of Passover in each year the Tetrarch distributes silver !

To the court of the Gentiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises , picks up her basket and exits , followed by the GREEK WOMAN , the FRUIT-SELLER with his basket , and the DOVE WOMANwith her cages . The MONEYCHANGERS pick up their tables and follow , with the PHARISEE behind them and , after him , MARIUS . SHADRACH It looks as if business was not so good , the way they abandon it . ZEBULON Does he indeed give silver ? JESSE Yes . No doubt Herod learned this trick from Caesar , a giving of public money to make all men his servants . SHADRACH DoubtfulAnd yet it is silver ; it 's a day 's wage . Will I go any more quickly to the eternal grinding machine because I took silver from Herod ? I think not . p. 63 REBA I think , since it 's not an hour for prayer and nothing is lost in duty or sacrifice , we may accept the money . JESSE Why , let us take it then . SHADRACH , CASSIA and ZEBULON go out . Perhaps I speak for an older and sterner time when the patriarchs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and REBA follow the others . JESHUA is left alone on the stage , looking after them . MIRIAM enters . MIRIAM Joseph , he 's here . JOSEPH enters . JESHUA Father , there are money-changers here in the Temple  --  and Herod gives silver here . JOSEPH Yes , Jeshua . But it should not be so  --  and was not when I was a child . There was no buying or selling licensed then within the Temple enclosure . MIRIAM We were frightened , Jeshua , and came to find you . JESHUA Mother , something so strange has happened . I was in the court of the Sanhedrin and they spoke of a prophecy I 've never heard . Father  --  why have we never studied Micah ? Why have I never heard of the prophecy concerning Bethlehem ? JOSEPH Will you let me tell you a little later ? It goes back so far into many things that have happened . Many times I 've tried to think of how to tell you . Still  --  I 'm not sure . And whatever I said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves  --  might fix our thinking . So that we quite believed something we only guess . Perhaps this much I can say now . When you were but a babe and the first Herod still lived , I had a dream warning that we must leave the realm of Herod and carry you secretly to Egypt . Now , we had no way of knowing whether my dream was merely a dream-or a dream sent of God . There is no proof of such things . But we were afraid , and obeyed it , and went to Egypt . Then it came true  --  for Herod killed all the children . p. 64 JESHUA Yes . That I knew . JOSEPH But that was not all . When Herod died in this blood and Herod 's sons became governors of his kingdom , we made our way back from Egypt-and again a dream warned me against the province of Judea , and we kept on north , to settle in Galilee under Herod Antipas . And now we must question , were we led wisely , was this last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no answer . JESHUA Only we 've been safe . JOSEPH Yes . Safe until we came to the city gates . Then-while we waited-the robber came from the desert to take you through . MIRIAM And that , in a way , was an answer . JOSEPH Or may have been . JESHUA I must tell you  --  in one night two or three years ago , when I 'd been ill , I felt you bending over me with a light when I was half asleep  --  and heard mother saying : " It 's as if there were an ushering of wings when I come to bring him water  --  and then a shadowing of wings overhead , when I shield him from the sun  --  Do you remember , Mother , what you said ? MIRIAM Yes , the whole air seemed troubled in the room , as if I were never ministering alone , but with bright companions . p. 65 JOSEPH You 're a child , Jeshua , but you see how we 've been troubled . From the beginning our race has always held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to release all Israel and destroy those who oppress us . Now we 're oppressed as we were in former times , and we hear all about us the whisper , and the cry , and the prophecy , too  --  " The Messiah , the Messiah ! " How are we to know that we have not dreamed because of our desire ? It 's not fair to lay the burden of this question on a child  --  for it 's only a question . It may not be true  --  but if you were he  --  in such case would it be fair to keep it from you ? JESHUA But , Father , would this be a burden ? Mother , would this be a burden ? You speak so strangely The Messiah is the Promised One , the Anointed who comes to us with an army , with the bright sword of justice , to war on evil , and make an end of weeping in Israel ! I have nothing in me to make me this prince who is promised .  --  You know me well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much , and goes about too much in dreams of the old heroes .  --  But if the day has come now for our Messiah  --  whether it light on me or another child  --  is it anything to be feared ? Let us say it is not for me  --  but it is our hope , the coming of the Messiah ! Is n't it , Mother ? MIRIAM Yes , Jeshua. p. 66 JOSEPH And yet our race  --  our dark , fierce , wistful race will not see the earth as the earth is . We live in a doubtful legend , and tell ourselves these tales  --  JESHUA The Messiah 's promised even in the wisdom of Solomon , the latest of all the wise books we have ! JOSEPH Yes , I know that . The sun 's dropped below the wall . It 's time to go . We have half an hour . JESHUA Could I sit here on the step  --  just a few minutes ? JOSEPH We dare not leave you , Jeshua . MIRIAM No , we dare not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's best that you should come with us now and never go out alone till we return to our house in Nazareth . JESHUA May I not stay in the Temple ? There was something I wished to find here . And have n't found . If I could sit here alone  --  MIRIAM We took no care at the gates  --  yet he was cared for . If this is a wish and from his heart  --  it may be wrong to take thought  --  we may lead him into danger . JOSEPH Then we 'll leave you , Jeshua . But come before it 's dark . JESHUA Yes , Father . JOSEPH and MIRIAM go out . JESHUA sits on the step with his head in his hand . FLACCUS , FESTUS and MARIUS enter and cross the stage . MARIUS pauses and looks back at JESHUA , then the SOLDIERS go out . ISHMAEL enters with a dagger in his hand . When he sees that MARIUS has gone , he replaces the dagger in his belt. p. 67 ISHMAEL Jeshua ! JESHUA rises . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert . The prophet Ishmael . ISHMAEL Not the robber Ishmael ? JESHUA Are you not a prophet ? ISHMAEL I am sent of God . Whether a prophet or some lesser tongue I shall not know . But God has given me words and my message is to you . Listen carefully for we have little time . JESHUA My father and mother have asked me to come home before the service . I fear I shall be late . Could you come with me ? ISHMAEL No , I must say it now , and you must hear it now . Though you be late . This is the culmination of my life , and for you it means the beginning . You may stay now or go  --  to join the others forever . JESHUA Then if I go , I could not see you tomorrow ? ISHMAEL No . I shall not speak tomorrow . Only tonight is illumined with the crossing of two stars , one dying and one born . JESHUA Is it good or evil you bring me ? ISHMAEL When you are older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know . p. 68 JESHUA Let me go home . ISHMAEL Yes . JESHUA starts to go out , then stops and turns . JESHUA I must stay to listen . I do trust you . You took me through the gates and watched over us in the desert . ISHMAEL When I spoke and knew you in the desert , did you know then why I watched over you ? JESHUA No . ISHMAEL Do you know now ? JESHUA is silent . Because I saw The Messiah in your eyes , and , taking your silver , felt the immortal substance in your hand , burning my clay . Are you not the Messiah ? JESHUA I have dreamed I was the Messiah . ISHMAEL In the night  --  or a waking dream ? JESHUA First it came in the night  --  then I remembered the dream , and called it back to see the beauty of fiery images and the men who came from the sky . ISHMAEL Tell me your dream . JESHUA I have never told it . ISHMAEL No , but tell it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JESHUA I walked among the cedars over Lebanon , and said to myself the words of the Unknown Prophet who has written in Isaiah  --  " Awake , awake , put on strength , O arm of the Lord ! Awake , as in the ancient days , in the generations of olden time ! " And , as I said these words , I heard a distant singing , and a little door was opened in the sky , high overhead many roods above me . Out of this small door came shining warriors clad in steel and silver who marched out into the clouds . Then a voice said , " Go up to them . " And I said , " I can not go , because they walk on cloud , " but the voice said , " Try , " and so I essayed a step , and the moving air had set itself like stone beneath my feet , so that I could climb . Then I went up the cloud among the army , and took the sword that hung above the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps of air . The Romans had drawn up across the Phoenician plain , toward the great sea , but when they saw that we walked above the sunrise they sent out an embassy . This came to me , and I said , " Send out the evil men . " They sent the men from galleys and prisons , but all these I turned back to them , and said again , " Send out the evil men , " This time they sent the beggars and the panders from the streets , but I turned them back , and said , " This one last time I ask it of you  --  send out the evil men ! " Then they sent their kings and the Emperor Augustus , and the tetrarchs , and the men who are set over at tasks and taxing , with the officers beneath them . And I came here to the holy city , to make it my capital , and rule wisely and justly . This was my dream  --  and now I 've told it . There is a pause. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you ? I have n't wept since the death of Judah , but now I find myself weeping . JESHUA Was this an evil dream ? ISHMAEL Not evil , but mistaken . If you wish to go you should go now  --  go back to Nazareth and root yourself there among poor villagers who are happy with what they have . JESHUA Why should I go ? ISHMAEL Because there 's no turning back once I 've spoken to you . Because it is my mission to fill your soul with a torment that will become an exaltation  --  because it is your mission to torment the earth , and exalt it . But tonight you will look with a child 's eyes into darkness and not see beyond . JESHUA How was my dream mistaken ? ISHMAEL It is true the Messiah will stand before the officers and the people and say , " Send out the evil men ! " But he will make this demand alone . There will come no army out of the sky to help . He will have few friends and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cry out wisdom to all men in the streets but they will not hear . The words that come from his mouth will scatter on barrens and in meagre places . He will be defeated . He will cause laughter and be set aside . p. 70 JESHUA But now I think you speak evil . You have not read the prophets . I will not believe you . The Messiah will win victories ! You know the Messiah must conquer ! ISHMAEL Yes , after a thousand years  --  or ten thousand . JESHUA How could it be he conquered after a thousand years ? ISHMAEL Or after ten thousand . After these years the memory of his face and the words he said , and his unearned affliction will move among men  --  will catch and move among them like fire  --  and they will turn and follow him  --  seeing evil where he saw it . JESHUA How can you know this ? This is a dream like mine . ISHMAEL I once believed that he would win his victories in the field , our Jewish Messiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat , and no solace for the mind save the reading of God 's word , I set myself to study what was said concerning the Messiah  --  and I found that none had understood . You quote to me the Unknown Prophet in Isaiah . Listen ! these words are his : " He was oppressed and he was afflicted , yet he opened not his mouth : he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and , as a sheep before her shearers is dumb , so he opened not his mouth . He was taken from prison and from judgment , and who shall declare his generation ? For he was cut off out of the land of the living , for the transgression of my people was he stricken . " Do you know what this means ? p. 71 JESHUA It seems to me a dark saying . ISHMAEL It means that the guiltless must suffer for the guilty , that the good are those who live their lives for others  --  that those who are evil , those who are base , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what has this to do with the Messiah ? Or with me ? The Messiah is sent to conquer the Romans ! ISHMAEL Yes  --  but not as you understand the meaning of conquest , The Messiah is sent to hunt out wisdom and truth , to speak this wisdom and truth in love to those who need his love , and in bitterness to those who have earned bitterness . And in the end for this love and bitterness with which he speaks he will become a symbol of those who are guiltless  --  and those who are guilty , seeing in him this symbol , will turn and destroy him . He will suffer for them and conquer them in their hearts . JESHUA The Messiah is not to suffer . He is not sent to suffer for others . I have never heard this said by my father or in the temple . ISHMAEL Remember the prophets  --  and listen again . " Yet it hath pleased the Lord to bruise him .  --  He hath put him to grief . Because he hath poured out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transgressors , and he bore the sin of many . " You have read this ? p. 72 JESHUA Yes . ISHMAEL Has it any meaning ? JESHUA Yes , it is true . I have read these things , and wondered . Yet if this is the Messiah the elders are wrong  --  and my father . ISHMAEL Yes , they are wrong . JESHUA Some of the words seem to say that he must die  --  that the Messiah must die . ISHMAEL Even this is true . He will die early ; a hateful and intolerable death , and nails will be through his hands . JESHUA Who has sent you to me ? ISHMAEL Who it is that orders the wheeling of the nights and hung your star on the mountain . Do you believe me ? Do you believe that I am come from God and speak his word ? JESHUA Yes . If I must .  --  When must he die ? ISHMAEL When he has spoken his wisdom , and the earth is roused up against him . JESHUA Could he not keep silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must say , what he has to do he must do . JESHUA There will be torture used before he dies ? ISHMAEL Yes . p. 73 JESHUA No , I can not ! I can not ! I have never borne pain ! I can not bear pain ! And I 'm afraid of death ! I can not face death ! I say this is not for me  --  to be this Messiah ! ISHMAEL Yet you will bear it ! JESHUA No ! ISHMAEL But if you were frightened  --  if you were afraid  --  afraid of Herod and of Herod 's men  --  and ran  --  then Herod would win  --  then you 'd die quickly and all men would die with you . JESHUA If I were afraid ? ISHMAEL Yes , if you were afraid .  --  You will go your way and be a child and forget . Yet in your mind what we have said will become a leaven that works in all you are and do . JESHUA Why did I trust you ? It 's grown dark , and you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've given you all I have . I 'm weary now and empty . Go if you wish . JESHUA If there were only someone I could ask ! Someone who could give an answer ! ISHMAEL Go into the Temple and pray for your old dream . If your God will give it back then you may have it still . JESHUA Yes , I will pray . He goes out . MARIUS enters opposite. p. 74 MARIUS I heard your conversation with the boy  --  the boy who was your son when I first saw you at the gates of the city . I heard what you said to him . What kind of madman are you ? ISHMAEL God knows how mad I am  --  and spent and weak and empty  --  MARIUS Something you said to this boy had a kind of meaning for me ; I 've been set here to watch the Temple and guard against a Messiah . What this is I never have quite known . But now it seems you feel quite certain what the Messiah is , and this lad is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then back before he speaks . Yes , it is true . I looked to my God for an answer , and within I heard his voice : " Speak to the soldier boldly , and say , ' This is the Messiah . ' " MARIUS I 'm grateful to you , and to your God , who makes things simple and clear even to men-at-arms , He crosses toward the Temple . ISHMAEL takes out his dagger . MARIUS turns. for I should hesitate indeed to strike down a child without good warrant . But I think your word is quite sufficient . He draws his sword and goes toward the inner Temple . ISHMAEL runs lightly after MARIUS and leaps to his back . A knife flashes and MARIUS is wounded , but turns and strikes down ISHMAEL with his sword . ISHMAEL lies where he falls ; MARIUS has sunk to one knee but rises and staggers out. p. 75 MARIUS Flaccus ! Festus ! I 'm wounded ! As he goesHelp , Flaccus  --  the beggar  --  help ! He crashes to the flag-stones offstage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs to him . JESHUA Ishmael ! Ishmael ! You 're hurt ! What is it ? There 's a trail of blood out toward the court ! ISHMAEL Run back , Jeshua ! Run back into the Temple ! The soldiers will come and find you here ! JESHUA But , Ishmael , I dare not run away ! I dare not be frightened ! ISHMAEL Quick , quick ! JESHUA You warned me not to run away , and you spoke for God ! He holds ISHMAEL 'S head on his arm . FESTUS OutsideThe beggar had a knife ! FLACCUS OutsideThere 's no life in him ! FESTUS EnteringThat 's the fellow , there ! FLACCUS EntersThere 's a child with him ! FESTUS Put the spawn out of the way  --  the dirty beggar and all his generation ! p. 76 FESTUS Yes , make him run , that 's best , and cut him down as he runs . They come near JESHUA . Run ! Run while you can ! Do you want to die there on the stones ? JESHUA rises and faces them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are Herod 's men . JESHUA I went into the Temple and prayed to God . I asked him whether Ishmael was false or a true man . Then a voice spoke out loud and said , " He is a messenger of my word . Follow him and turn not back . " I can not run from Herod 's men , nor be frightened of them . FESTUS draws sword . FESTUS This is a clean , sharp sword ! Do you want your blood to darken it ? JESHUA No . FESTUS Then let me see you run while you still can run ! JESHUA But if I run from Herod or Herod 's men , I shall die quickly , having displeased my God ! I must stay and face you . There is an uncertain pause . FLACCUS Put up your sword . You ca n't strike down a child who looks up at you . Let them alone . There 's some necromancy with these Jewish gods and temples . And the beggar 's dying . Let them alone . p. 77 FESTUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits and again pillows the old man 's head on his arm. @x SCENE The roof of HEROD 'S palace . HEROD and MIRA are looking out over the city . MIRA For ten days now they have done no work . The walls of our new palace stand as they stood then , below the line of trees . Is it abandoned ? Is it never to be finished ? HEROD Why do you ask ? MIRA Because there 's been no work done these ten days . HEROD This is the time of year when all the Jews go up to Jerusalem . I encouraged them to go this year  --  for my purposes . But now the work will be resumed . Before the end of summer , you will have your apartments overlooking the lake . For now the work will proceed with a vengeance . There 's been too much talk among the Jews , and too little done . The SOOTHSAYER enters . Yes ?

HEROD Good evening , my lord Hanan , and to you , and you . You all know what I seek for . Give me what evidence you have . I begin at once , Lord Hanan , and begin with you . Has the rumor of this presence passed your way ? HANAN I have had no word . HEROD You conveyed my message to the scribes and priests ? HANAN Yes . As you said it to me , Lord Herod . HEROD There came no answer  --  of any sort  --  no cryptic message , wrapped in words , which I might understand if I heard it ? HANAN Not a whisper from all the Temple . HEROD You were thorough ? There has been no miracle , no sudden apparition to those that tend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; no wisdom in the Temple or among the men of the Sanhedrin beyond what 's usual there ? HANAN I should have heard of it , of that I 'm certain . HEROD Then you , sir  --  taking the census , some unexpected presence at the gates disturbed you for a moment  --  on some day which may come back to you now I mention it .  --  Some child with a strange wisdom on his face that caused your hair to rise , just for a moment , and then was forgotten ? p. 80 THE SCRIBE Your Highness , I hesitate to speak of this , lest I seem negligent , but there is one face , out of those that passed the gates , which haunts me in the night . HEROD The face of a child ? THE SCRIBE Yes , of a child . HEROD Was he of the age and city which have been specified ? THE SCRIBE No , he was not . HEROD But bring him to me . THE SCRIBE My lord , although his name is written in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot-hills of Mount Nebo  --  the son of a bandit or a wild tribesman . This is desert country , full of desperate men , impossible to search . HEROD Yet we will search there ! We will search the plains of Nebo thoroughly . I give you this task . THE SCRIBE Bowing and stepping backYes , my lord . HEROD Centurion ! THE CENTURION Yes . HEROD How did it come that a trusted man was killed in the Temple court  --  a man I myself had set to guard against the Messiah ? THE CENTURION He was struck down by a wild man from the desert  --  and the wild man was killed in his turn . This would seem to end the matter . p. 81 HEROD Was there a child about the Temple , or near it , at the time ? THE CENTURION Nothing was said of a child . HEROD Everywhere he eludes me , and he does elude me , for he was there . His hand was in this . Can it be , I wonder that he has left our kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still hangs on the Galilean night , and out-burns Jupiter , and dims great Mars along the west . He is here . HEROD Try this stratagem , Centurion  --  try this ! My wife has asked why the work 's slow on our palace . From now on the work will go rapidly . Use what force you need ; drive them , listen to no excuses ; let them understand that they are slaves , incite our Galilee to rebellion if you can . Then out of this we 'll get our palace done , and out of this , if there should be rebellion , and it should find a leader , there 's our man  --  he 'll be the one we seek . Do you understand ? THE CENTURION Make them desperate , and look for a leader . HEROD Yes . And now you may go . Go all of you except Mira , my wife . The SCRIBE , the CENTURION , the SOOTHSAYER , and HANAN go out . MIRA We may get our palace done , and for that I thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped you ! p. 82 HEROD Escaped me ? It 's in my star  --  that I shall destroy the Messiah ! It 's in his star that I shall destroy him ! Though he escape me now , as he may  --  though he escape me for years , yet soon or late , I shall be his death . Yet sometimes it seems that I seek the impalpable , try to put my finger on that which walks the streets and is not seen , on that which pierces to the heart , yet leaves no wound or scar . Suppose the Messiah came like the voice of a bird , suppose he came like dawn across the earth ? What man has turned back the morning ? What king has taken the measure of the wind ?

Whatever you have to say to us can be said without a waste of voice . The CENTURION enters after JOSEPH . THE CENTURION As you remember I was easy with you when I was here last . Things have changed a little . I ca n't make you the same offer . You 'll come to work , and you 'll take your chance as to who 's the overseer and what you 'll get to do . To JOSEPHYou once said to me , there are no slaves in Galilee.  --  That 's changed . That 's different now . There are slaves .  --  I want five men from this house at the palace this morning . If you want to know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're troublemakers . You 've been seen in company we do n't like  --  men from the desert  --  and prophets that go about inciting to revolt . There was a beggar around this house before you left , and another was seen with you on the road to Jerusalem . Judah 's men probably  --  both of them . You know when you 're wanted  --  and where . You 'll come . He turns , goes up steps and out. p. 85 ZEBULON The voice of Caesar . JOSEPH Yes , and of Herod .  --  I tried to put it from my mind while we were away . But under the happiness of our journey , under the ritual of the Temple and under our holy songs , this undertone was heard incessantly : We must return to face the Centurion . SHADRACH How can we serve them and keep our faith  --  even a shred of faith ? JESSE But disobedience to a Roman edict means death for all of us . SHADRACH If we had a leader ! JOSEPH If we had a leader , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader  --  even then our revolution would end as Judah 's ended  --  in death for many , and life on the hills for many  --  and nothing gained . SHADRACH A leader like Moses then , who could take us out of this into something better  --  something with a hope in it ! JOSEPH I 've heard it said there are no more promised lands . JESSE But easy , Shadrach  --  this is a matter of bones in a cemetery . Bones are not sacred . SHADRACH To them it means desecration ! They spit on our lips and our altars ! And our God is up for sale in Jerusalem ! We saw it , and this is all part of it ! p. 86 JOSEPH If the men will come with me we can talk this over better among ourselves . SHADRACH , ZEBULON , JESSE and JOSEPH go toward the portal , JESHUA rises . No , not you , Jeshua . The men go out . MIRIAM You should take your eyes from your book sometimes , my Jeshua . You read as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MIRIAM Yes.As if you were fevered , and only more and more reading would quench your thirst . JESHUA It is like that . MIRIAM What water is it you seek , my son , reading your eyes out early in the morning , and then into the night , till the last light 's gone ? He is silent . What was it happened the night you were late at the Temple ? JESHUA Oh , mother , tell me  --  is it true  --  or did I imagine it  --  that I stayed all night with the prophet before he died in the court of the Temple  --  and you found me there in the early morning ? MIRIAM We came in the early morning and found you there . JESHUA Then it may all be true  --  it may be true  --  even in this bright daylight ! Oh , Mother , is it so sure  --  is it certain , Mother , that I  --  am this one  --  who is chosen ? p. 87 MIRIAM Your father 's not sure . JESHUA But you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who dreamed ? Did nothing come to you ? MIRIAM No dream . JESHUA Then was it all his wishing , as he had feared , his own desire ? MIRIAM Could you believe so , Jeshua ? JESHUA I could wish to believe so . MIRIAM When you are older you shall know all my heart in all these things , when you 're only a little older . JESHUA Tell me your heart . Say it now . MIRIAM Why , Jeshua ? JESHUA Because it 's part of my fever  --  that I must hear it . Because I must know what I am and what will come to me . In all this I read in the holy books it 's as if I set my lips to Dead Sea water , so that I 'm thirstier still  --  and must know more ! MIRIAM What do You read ? JESHUA The prophecies . MIRIAM Concerning the Messiah ? JESHUA Yes . MIRIAM If I could tell you now  --  She puts out her hand to JESHUA , JESHUA sits on floor at her feet . Mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never said this  --  perhaps I ca n't say it now . When a mother speaks to a son who is twelve years old , there 's a veil woven between what she may know and he may hear  --  it 's as it was when you tried to tell your dream  --  do you remember ? p. 88 JESHUA Yes . MIRIAM And now I find that I can not speak . Only an angel came to me in a vision , saying when you were born your name was to be called Jeshua , and of your kingdom there was to be no end . This you may keep in your heart , as I have kept it till now in mine . You are indeed  --  you are He . Whatever has been prophesied for Him will be yours , will come to us  --  and we shall see it when you are grown a man . JESHUA Oh , mother , I know you would n't hurt me  --  MIRIAM Hurt you , Jeshua ? But it was you who said in the outer court of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could mean only happiness . JESHUA Yes , I said it then .  --  When you spoke with the angel did you learn from him how the Messiah must die ? MIRIAM I have never heard that he will die . There is to be no end to the Messiah 's kingdom . JESHUA But he must die . This is what I heard from the robber prophet , from Ishmael , when he lay dying in the court , and I held his hand . The Messiah will not live to see his kingdom . He will be arraigned and tortured , and die under torture . He will find a teaching which can save men , but they will not follow it . They will despise him , will send soldiers to find him and set him before the judges . He will die to save others . This was said to me by the robber , and I could n't believe him . But now I read the rolls day and night  --  read all the passages that have to do with his coming . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means is that I 'm chosen out of all the children to be tortured for the others when the time comes for us to be men together . It 's not a kingship  --  not to lead armies , not to die old , or in battle , but to be hurried to a sacrifice and die young , a criminal 's death ! p. 89 MIRIAM He was evil , evil  --  this man from the desert ! JESHUA I said he was evil ! Yes , it seemed like madness to me ! But all the books say what he said  --  it 's there to be read by all who wish to read it ! MIRIAM But it has no meaning ! JESHUA Yes , Mother , it has a meaning . Its meaning is that the death of the innocent will work in the hearts of those who murder them , till the murderers are sorry , and have changed , and never again take life unjustly ! It may mean more , may mean even that our race is chosen , our poor race of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messiah must suffer for our own . MIRIAM Where have you read this ? JESHUA In all of them . That 's why I 've lain awake to read when light came into the sky at morning . and at night till my lamp went out . And they do say this . How we could all have missed it , and hoped so long for angels out of Heaven , I do n't know  --  for it 's plain there in the prophecies ; there 's to be no help come down from God . Our help must come from within , from our hearts , from those who are willing to die rather than accept injustice . And now you tell me your vision . And I know . I must somehow find the truth , according to my soul , and speak it , and die for it  --  hoping somehow it will prevail long after I 'm dead . p. 90 MIRIAM I will not believe this , Jeshua  --  JESHUA But I wish you would . Then I would n't be alone . In all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died for saying it to me . And now I must carry it . Will you read the books ? MIRIAM I 'll read them if you like . If it will help . JESHUA And then we can talk about them . MIRIAM Yes . JESHUA The book of Enoch says it clearly . MIRIAM I 'll read the book of Enoch . JESHUA You 'll read it first ? MIRIAM Yes . First of all .  --  If this were what it means to be the Messiah  --  to suffer and to die for others  --  if it were not an honor  --  no , but a dishonored death and misery  --  JESHUA Yes ? MIRIAM Would you choose it then  --  ? JESHUA If I should find that I 'm still chosen and still wanted when I come to be a man , then it may be God would help me . Maybe even if I came to you you could help me then . MIRIAM I , Jeshua ? JESHUA We shall be older . We shall both have learned by then . I must find my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , JESSE and ZEBULON enter. p. 91 JOSEPH If we are to go we must go soon . And Jeshua should be ready . There were five called for . SHADRACH Yet I still say what hope have we as a nation ? Give us a little something to look forward to , and we can go on ! But what is there . unless it 's plain slavery ? MIRIAM Is our Jeshua a workman among you ? JESSE Yes . MIRIAM Could he speak to you as if he were a man ? JESSE Yes , if he wishes . Do you wish to speak . Jeshua ? JESHUA I have nothing of my own to say . But just as Shadrach asked what hope we have , the book of Enoch opened under my hand , to a part that I 've read often May I read it ? SHADRACH Yes , read it . JESHUA It 's the last chapter . " A city is but the outer hull , or garment , of the faith which dwells within . Its palaces and walls that stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are blown into these shapes by the spirit which inhabits  --  blown like a bubble , and will subside again when the spirit is withdrawn . And what is true of cities is true of kingdoms . For a cycle of years they keep their faith , and this faith holds them steady against the winds . But when they cease to believe only a little while , the high roofs take rain , and the walls sink to the moat . There was once a city whose walls were destroyed by music blown against them , but the walls of every city are raised up by music , and are held foursquare in the sun by a people 's secret singing . " p. 92 SHADRACH I must read the Scriptures . There are others beside Ecclesiastes . JESHUA Yes . Then he says : " The palace built by a king without a faith will not endure  --  but there are palaces not built by hands , and those can not be torn down by the hands of kings . " SHADRACH It 's true . The kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , even for the people of Israel . But tell us then ; Are we never to turn on the kings ? Where is the line ? How far can a man serve Herod ? JESHUA Until he asks of you what belongs to God . MIRIAM rises and looks at JOSEPH . JOSEPH Until he asks of us what belongs to God . SHADRACH What part of a man belongs to God ? JESHUA His mind . his freedom , his freedom to find his way to God in his own way . SHADRACH Turns to othersWell , shall we go ? ZEBULON RisingWhy , yes , we can go now . He and JESSE go out JOSEPH And you 've not Lost your faith ? SHADRACH Lost it ? Lost my faith ? I 've just now found it . Just this moment found it . He goes out. p. 93 JOSEPH So have I , I think . Yes , so have I. He follows the others . JESHUA I must go with them , Mother , I 'm needed , too . MIRIAM Yes , Jeshua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
