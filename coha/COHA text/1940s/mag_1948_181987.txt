For three years , British athletes had gone from bad to worse . They just could not win . Even their race horses got beaten by interlopers from France . Last week , when 275 golfers teed off in the cherished British Open , few Britons had much hope . Their best bet was acid Henry Cotton , now an old veteran of 41 . It had been 14 long years since he had cracked a ten-year U.S. monopoly by winning his first British Open . <P> Henry Cotton is the highest paid and best dressed pro in Britain . At last year 's British Open , he parked his big black Rolls-Royce beside the 18th green at Hoylake , so that he could drive away triumphantly when his day 's work was done ( he finished sixth ) . No such liberties were permitted last week at Muirfield , which Scots regard as hallowed ground . In the qualifying round he shot two 69s , to lead the field . The skeptics considered it a fluke . Some crack golfers had struggled in behind him . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Open Champion Lawson Little and Claude Harmon ( winner of the recent Masters ' Tournament ) . <P> When the real shooting began , Cotton kept close to the leaders with a 71 . Next day he was presented to King George VI at the first tee ( the first time a reigning monarch had ever witnessed a British golf championship ) . With his King watching , Cotton smacked a prodigious drive down the fairway . He birdied that first hole . Then he proceeded to tear Muirfield apart-green by green and fairway by fairway . His best round : a blistering 66 , a record for the course in a British Open . <P> As he stepped out for the final 36 holes , his tanned face furrowed , a spectator murmured : " He looks like the wrath of God . " Knowing how he hates distractions , Cotton 's plump , wealthy wife ( daughter of an Argentine cattle baron ) followed him at a safe distance . He had a four-stroke lead to protect . <P> On the last hole of the tourney , he flubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But on the next try , the ball hopped out like a trained rabbit , five feet from the pin . He canned the putt for a score of 284 , enough to win his third British Open and the cheers of 10,000 spectators . The first prize was worth only $600 in cash , but a hundred times that in prestige . As a shot in the arm for British sport lovers , the value of his victory was beyond reckoning .
