txt Dixie newspaper people , harassed by the scarcity and high price of newsprint , have cheering news these days : The supply of the priceless paper made in their own backyard may soon be-quadrupled . The south 's first  --  and still only  --  newsprint factory . Southland Paper Mills , Inc. , started operations in 1940 , deep in the pine forests near Lufkin , Texas . This plant , using a revolutionary technique , was the first mill in the country to manufacture newsprint from southern pine . That timber had been considered undersirable for newsprint making , mainly because of its high pitch content . Southland Paper Mills , supplying papers throughout the southwest and in Mexico , was first geared to producing 50,000 tons of paper a year . Now capacity has been doubled : a second giant machine is expected to begin operation next month . Plans are now under way for a second Dixie newsprint'mill . Its paper is to be distributed even beyond the south . Next week . a company partly owned and financed by southern newspaper publishers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractors to build a plant , capable of 100,000 tons a year , near Childersburg , Alabama . Power and water facilities left over from a big wartime ordnance plant will be utilized by the new firm . By October . construction should start and the first batch of paper . it is hoped , will be coming off production lines by January 1 , 1950 . Southern pine will be the main pulp source for this factory , also . Headline Hunger Last year the nation 's hunger for headlines gobbled up 4.2 million tons of paper , between 800,000 and 1 million tons going to states below the Mason-Dixon line . About 80% of this newsprint came down from Canada , the rest principally from Maine , Texas Washington and Oregon within the United States . Southern newspaper owners , far from producing sources , pay a list price of from $4 to $5 a ton more than New York City counterparts , largely because of higher freight fees Ever since 1931 , they 've been looking at thousands of acres of loblolly and short leaf pine in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own newsprint . Wood . water and labor . the prime necessities of paper making , are all available in great quantities . Besides , presence of a- newsprint industry would open up possibilities for a wholly new kind of agriculture in the back country scrub lands  --  tree farming . Southern publishers are famous home country " boosters " and the idea appealed to them . The Coosa River undertaking started back in 1944 when a group of Alabama citizens became concerned over the shut-down of the big ordnance plant near Childersburg producing TNT and other high-caliber explosives . They formed the Talladega County War Plants Conversion Committee to look for a peacetime substitute for their war industry . They discovered an ally in the Yinuthern Newspaper Publishers Association , which had been looking for a likely place to set up a newsprint factory since the early 1930 's . By coincidence , the publishers ' independent surveys had established that a location just 30 miles from Childersburg was the ideal spot . Last June a 40-year lease was signed for the facilities of the ordnance plant , which Include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , capable of handling 23 million gallons a day . An Unconventional Financing Meanwhile , the promoters had formed a corporation and placed an initial $1 million in common stock , largely with neighboring Alabama business men and influential publishers . The whole program by-passed the conventional underwriting method of distributing new securities . The founders looked around for a trained organization to manage actual plant operations . Kimberly-Clark Corp. , 75-year old Neenah . Wis .. manufacturer of Kleenex and Kotex. was selected . Kimberly-Clark , which is buying $2.5 million of the common stock itself , promises if the company does n't earn 5% on a $32 million total capitalization , it will step out . The Wisconsin firm also is contracting for a third of the new plant 's newsprint output , which it will sell to regular customers  --  The New York Tunes , Cleveland Plain-Dealer , Richmond ( Ind . ) Palladium and others . These outside customers are putting up another $2 million in stock . Even more important , Kimberly-Clark will be the largest single customer of Coosa River for another product , bleached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons will go to the Wisconsin firm 's plant in Memphis for fabrication into cleansing tissue and sanitary napkins . Sale of sulphate , at prevailing market prices , will add about $16 million a year to gr6ss volume . When it comes to producing the paper . the Alabama entrepreneurs contend they have it all over their Canadian rivals in everything except power and taxes . The southern company will have the advantage in timber- and labor and the important matter of inventory . Because of difficulty in getting wood down from cutting sites in winter , the Canadians have to keep more than a year 's timber inventory on hand . In the mild south only a six weeks ' supply is necessary . Wood is the major cost item . In the Coosa River area , pine wood , suitable for paper making , is available at around 514 a cord . Timberland for a Start When southern farmers heard the new company was going to be in the market for timberlands , prices inflated fast . However . by making arrangements with large landowners , the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights were obtained for 65,000 acres from the Alabama Power Co. , 20,000 acres from the University of Alabama and 70,000 acres from Georgia Power . In addition , about $600,000 was spent buying land from private sources , and 17 Kimberly-Clark foresters arc now on the job preparing for cutting . Eventually , the company will need between 300,000 and 400,000 acres of woodlands . The possibility of reoccupation of the ordnance plant by the army in case of war has been anticipated . A " recapture clause " provides the enterprise supply power and water in the same amounts used by the ordnance plant in World War II . which would still leave enough for full paper production . As sulphates are used in explosives , there would be an additional market for their by-product . Coosa River pays the government $50,000 a year for use of the power and water facilities . Edward L. Norton , company president , says the governhient had figured on spending about 510,000 annually in preserving the facilities in good stand-by condition , so will be the gainer . Mr. Norton says an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life Insurance Co. , before it sank $8 rrullion into the venture , prophesied newsprint prices could drop to $70 a ton from the present $96 northeastern zone price and still allow a profit at Coosa River . ( In depression years , the price got down to about $40 per ton . ) The one-third of production going to northern newspapers is considered a protecting factor , spreading the economic risk should the south have an economic set-back . Fatal Calculation " We have figured this thing from every possible angle , " says Mr. Norton . " For example , we know , or think we do , we will have two workers killed constructing the plant and another 20 will probably be sent to the hospital at one time or another with injuries . " A big job remains for the Coosa River backere ? raising the money to finish the job Part will come from insurance companies which . led by Metropolitan Life , have promised to be heavy takers of $14 million in 4% bonds The publishers , themselves , must ante up at least 58 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75,000 tons ofnewsprint a year , or more . As amateur securities salesmen , the top men in the new firm are making the rounds of southern cities now , talking to publishers and taking orders . Charlotte , Richmond , Atlanta , Louisville and New Orleans have been covered by the officials : Chairman Donald Corner . head of Avondale Mills , a big Alabama texthe firm : President Norton , Birmingham raelio chain owner : and board member , Clarence Ronson. chairman of the Southern Newspaper Publishers Association 's newsprint committee . At the halfway point , in Dallas last Tuesday , the novice promoters had sold $4 million of stock and solicited commitments for $2.5 million more . The goal : $10 million worth of $50 par common from fellow publishers . With each two shares of $50 stock , the newspaper owner is entitled to buy a ton of newsprint a year . Subscriptions From $500,000 to $1,000 Largest subscribers , to date , have been , surprisingly , a couple of papers from outside the area  --  the Washington , D. C. , Star and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miami Herald , New Orleans Times-Picayune , Oklahoma Publishing Co. , Nashville Tennessean and Banner have taken ownerships of more than $150,000 each . At the other end of the scale , the Dothan ( Ala . ) Eagle is listed for $15,000 and the Borger ( Texas ) News-Herald is understood to have put up $1,000 . When Coosa River goes into production , the south cain turn out a total of 200,000 tons of newsprint , or about a fifth of present requirements . There wo n't be any publishers relying wholly on southern sources for a long time to come . In the first place , publishers ' paper needs have been growing . But it will come in handy . A. H. Belo Corp. , which publishes the Dallas Morning News , says to take care of increased requirement , it has had to pay over $500,000 in premiums for extra allotments in the last seven months . ? Newsprint is contracted for in long-term contracts , running usually 10 years , partly as depression insurance for the paper producers and partly to assure newspapers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't alter existing contracts . In fact , they profess to be constantly worried over the prospect of northern shippers withdrawing from southern markets . Recent freight raises have at least in part been absorbed by newsprint makers which would tend to make southern delivery less profitable than sales to customers closer to the sources of supply .
