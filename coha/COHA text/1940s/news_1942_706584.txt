txt The text of the address by .51-r . Nelson is on Page 6 . DETROIT , July ** nation 's war goods production will be $45,000,000,000 this year and $70 , - 000,000,000 to $75,000,000,000 the next , Donald M. Nelson said in an address tonight at a dinner of the Automotive Council for War Production attended by 2,000 executives of the automobile industry . Pointing to production achievements so far , which he said had been greater than were believed possible , the chairman of the War Production Board declared that " we can look to the future with the sober , solid confidence of people who have tested their own strength and determination . " Now " it looks as if we would have a rather long war , " but though " we are going to be tried very hard " if that proves to be the case , " we can face those trials without flinching , " he said . Points to " Great Common Aim " Of major importance , he said , was the fact that " we are rediscovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one great common aim , " he went on , " to perfect our freedom and guard it fiercely . " Speaking of production Mr. Nelson said : " During this calendar year , the factories of the United States will turn out war goods of one kind or another to a value of approximately 45 billion dollars . Next year I expect that that figure will rise to 70 or 75 billions , at current prices . I do not believe that it can ever rise much above that figure , because I think that that is just about the limit that our economy can stand . The materials which would be needed to get production substantially higher than that simply are not available , and as far as we can see now they can not be made available . But in any case , getting up to the 45 billion dollar level this year will be a splendid achievement , and raising the level to 75 billions next year will be nothing less than magnificent . " Praising accomplishments of the automobile industry , he paid tribute to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than five billion dollars worth of war orders have been placed with the industry since Pearl Harbor , he said , and when the peak is reached output will be at the rate of $12,000,000,000 a year . This , he pointed out , is three times the industry 's estimated 1941 sales and will represent about one-sixth of the nation 's total war production . " Those are amazing figures , " he observed . " I think every one connected with the automotive industry is entitled to feel a great deal of honest pride in the fact that such great reliance can be placed upon this industry in this time of national peril . But I think we also must realize that this tremendous job is just getting under way . The peak is still ahead of us . The decks have been cleared for action , but the action has barely begun . " Turning to civilian economy , Mr. Nelson said that the country had set up an excellent mechanism for getting and keeping the proper balance in our over-all production , but when the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should rest in civilian hands . " That does not for one moment mean that our civilian economy is going to be pampered , " he said . " On the contrary , our civilian economy for the rest of this war will operate at an efficiency level , and no higher . By that I mean that we shall produce for our civilian economy those things , and only those things , which we must have in order to get maximum productivity and efficiency out of our national plant . We are going to get along without things , as individuals , and adjust ourselves to the second best , and make old things do , as we have never done before in all our lives . " At the speaker 's table were sixty leaders in automotive industry . Among them were Edsel Ford , Lieut . Gen. William S. Knudsen , C. E. Wilson and Ernest Kanzler , chief of the automotive branch of the War Production Board .                    @
