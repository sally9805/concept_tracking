txt LONDON , March ** Atlantic pact was hailed here today ( with more fervor and hope than any agreement in the memory of living men . From Foreign Secretary Bevin , who spoke in Parliamer ? and in a broadcast to the nation , to the humblest British citizen it seemed to bring the first genuine promise of peace in our time . Mr. Bevin brought out much more clearly in his simple broadcast tonight than in his statement to Parliament that the Atlantic pact is primarily a defense against Soviet communism . He provided a catalogue , into which tones of sit // terness often crept , of the way in which the Russians have obstructed the efforts of the Western nations to achieve peace and collective security . He blamed Moscow for what he termed the failure of the United Nations to date , for the futility of the Council of Foreign Ministers , for the violation of those peace treaties that were made and for the suppression of democratic liberties in Eastern Europe . " Frankly , " Mr. Bevin said , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations did not fulfill its purpose , neither has the United Nations . " There was nothing to do , he said , but to build up collective security in the west through the Brussels Pact , the Marshall Plan and now the Atlantic pact . This was a day of quiet and heartfelt satisfaction expressed in Parliament , in the newspapers , weeklies , and in all comments except the lone and derided voices of the Communists and fellow travelers . The pact was greeted as the opening of a new era , the end of United States isolationism , the beginning of real collective security and  --  quite frankly and openly ? as , the most powerful bulwark yet erected against the spread of revolutionary communism . " I think I can say without exaggeration that this is an historic occasion , " Mr. Sevin told a cheering House of Commons this afternoon . " It is certainly one of the greatest steps toward world peace and security which has been taken since the end of the first World War , and if we look at the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Hemisphere I think we can say that this agreement marks the opening of a new era of cooperation and understanding . " Wider Roof of Security Mr. Bevin emphasized that it was purely a defensive pact , aimed against " no nation innocent of aggressive intentions " and that it was i conformity with the United Nations Charter . He told how " this new pact brings us under a wider roof of security , " a roof , he stressed , from the United States and Canada over the whole of Western Europe , including Greece and beyond to Turkey and Iran and the British Commonwealth and Empire . Members of Parliament credited him with putting his finger on one of the main factors when he said : " The pact must be regarded as the complete expression of identity of views long held among the Western nations . It recognizes the common heritage and civilization of their peoples , founded on principles of dgmocracy , individual , liberty and fhe rule of law between nations . It is not elaborate ; its simplicity is apparent , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding and a determination to preserve our way of life . " In concluding his statement to the House the Foreign Secretary paid tribute to the " wise understanding " of the United States Government and people , a tribute that was echoed by other speakers and throughout the British press . " This is the first time that the United States have ever felt able to contemplate entering into commitments in peacetime for joint defense with Europe , " Mr. Bevin said , " and it is a most famous historical HAILS TREATY Ernest Bevin Mae New York Yirmeri Mond or Ekrreau , undertaking in which they are now entering in common with the rest of us . " It seems generally agreed that the United States has gone as far or even farther than could have been hoped , especially in the already famous Article 5 defining the obligations of members . " No more binding formula than this could fairly be asked by the countries of Western Europe , " The Times , London , will say in its editorial tomorrow morning .

Butler , speaking for the Conservatives and , in this case , for all of the members , expressed regret that Winston Churchill , who has done so much to bring the pact into being , should have been absent , as he sailed today for the United States . The only Labor M.P . who spoke against the pact was W. N. Warbey , left-winger , who was repudiated by a number of other Laborites and who certainly spoke for a very small group in his party . The atmosphere in and out of Parliament was well expressed by Mr. Sevin at the end of his broadcast when he said : " We have today embarked on a great adventure . " Mr. Bevin ' sails from Southampton next Friday on the Queen Mary for the ceremony of signing the pact in Washington where he is expected to stay about ten days .
