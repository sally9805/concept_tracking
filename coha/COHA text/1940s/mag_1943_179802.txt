A far-reaching cut in airline passenger fares was announced jointly this week by giant amphibious Pan American Airways and its scrappy , up- &-coming; offshoot , Pan American-Grace Airways . The cuts average 10% , affect all flights between the U.S. and Latin America , will save 500,000-odd Pan Am-Panagra customers $1,250,000 yearly . Sample cuts : Miami to Buenos Aires $550 to $495 ; Miami-Lima $354 to $320 ; Miami-Bogota $213 to $183 . The new rates will become effective whenever the airlines get CAB approval ( probably two months ) . <P> Unlike most price-cutters , Pan Am and Panagra did not reduce rates to get more business-they already have more traffic than they can handle , practically all flights have long waiting lists . Instead they cut rates after CAB held a closed session with airline operators , broadly hinted the jam-packed U.S.-Latin American airlines were making too much money-especially in wartime . Next to get a similar hint will be U.S. domestic airlines , which hiked profits over 100% in the first nine months in contrast to a 30% decline in general corporation profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings , most operators are not worried , feel confident their profits will be quickly regained when they get enough planes and equipment to handle all available business . Meanwhile the airlines will put themselves in a better spot to lure still more traffic from the rail and steamship lines .
