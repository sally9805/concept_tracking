txt Ailing western pine prices are showing signs of renewed health . In the last few days pine sawmills , which dot the twelve western states . have raised prices $2 to $5 per thousand feet on many grades . The increase has not affected all mills and types of lumber . But the trend , say operators . is clearly upward , reversing a prolonged downswing . Average prices now are still 10% under a year ago . pine men . who were bearish on prospects in June . when the price shakedown was worst , have turned optimistic . They think the upward movement will continue . Fir and pine are the chief building woods . Fir is used mainly for the framework of houses ? in beams , studs . joists and other framing . Pine is an interior lumber . It 's used to make cabinets and other millwork , window sashes , doors and door frames . Both are softwoods . Together . the western states Douglas fir and pine mills provide the nation with about half of its softwood . Orders Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after dropping as much as 20% in a three-month period last spring . For example . two-by-fours that now bring $52 a thousand at the mill sold two months ago for $44 . Sales and production are holding high , too . In the week ended September 24 the fir industry had the biggest cut of any week this year , but orders exceeded output by 9.6% . Back of the western pine price boost is rising demand . The industry 's sales in the week ended October 1 were the largest so far this year ; orders ran 23% over production . In the like week last year orders were P% below output . There 's a variety of surmises in the industry on what 's behind the flood of orders this late in the season : ordinarily buying in . the autumn slackens off as home builders get ready for wintertime shutdowns in the colder ' regions of the country. - Many mill men acclaim the bigger-thanexpected boom in home building late in the summer as the cause of the lumber buying spree . Inventories of lumber in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift building pace and there 's a rush now to re-stock . Of course , in balmier chines. like California 's , building goes on most of the winter . A Rise in Dixie A wholesaler here points out that higher prices for southern pine have had an effect on the western market . " A few weeks ago . " he reports . " southern pine went up sharply . In a search for lower-priced lumber , buyers turned to a surplus of- No. 3 western pine and just about cleaned up the stock . That helped to bolster prices . " Another factor in th " scramble for lumber arises from the mechanics of getting pine boards ready for market . Before shipment they have to be dried , either in kilns or in the open air . Otherwise the gi een dripping umber would stain and turn black . But about half of the 2,000 sawmills in the western pine area do n't have kiln drying equipment . They air-dry lumber in yards near their mills . In the warm spring and summer months that process takes only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air it 's a matter of months . " We figure . " says a veteran pine manufacturer , " that just about anything cut after mid-September ca n't be on the market until late spring if it has to be air-dried . " Result Is a Rush As a result , buyers now are rushing to get as much pine as possible on order before the supply is cut back . The current race for pine has boosted the western industry 's unfilled order file to the highest level in three years : at the end of October order backlogs totaled more than 700 million feet . Most mills report they now have all the business they can handle for several months to come . That helps make up for the lag in volume earlier this year . S. V. Fullaway , Jr .. secretary-manager of the Western Pine Association , reports that in the first nine months of 1949 shipments totaled 4,566 million feet , or 11.8% less than in the like period of 1948 . The industry , from its half-billion dollars of plants , set a production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lumber . Pre-war production of western pine never exceeded 5,000 million feet in any one year . This year Mr. Fullaway estimates the cut will be at least 10% under 1948 because , when prices sagged last spring , many marginal . high-cost mills closed down . Preponderantly Ponderosa . The majority of western pine lumber is Ponderosa , the rest is Idaho white pine and sugar pine . Ponderosa trees grow up to 31/2 feet in diameter . The wood closely resembles white pine and it is used for similar purposes . For years , finished Ponderosa has been the leading material for interior woodworking . Rough lumber goes for sheathing and sub-flooring. roof-decking , concrete forms , industrial crating and box stock . Idaho white pine is a western cousin of the white pine found in New England . The trees , varying between two and four feet in diameter and rarely over 150 feet in height , are the smallest of the three pine-s . However , the lumber has leas pitch and is popular for patternmaking . Its softer texture makes for less waste . Sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average about 31/2 feet and can top 200 feet skyward . Sugar pine lumber ranges in color from creamy white to a pale brown . faintly tinged with pink . It is distinguished by little flecks and intermittent lines of darker shade running parallel with the grain . For this reason . it is popular for interior trim . Wood technologists say " there is absolutely no positive means of identifying the three while pines one from another microscopically . " However , nature has given her own mark to the trees . A Ponderosa has three needles in a cluster , the other two have five . Record of Pine Prices The price index published by the Western Pine Association tells what has happened to pine prices since last January . As the year started , the average for all grades of Ponderosa was $72.33 a thousand feet . as compared with $68.86 for January . 1948 . By June the average had slumped to $70.33. as compared with $72 25 for the like month last year . Last month the average price was $66.82 as contrasted to $75.97 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be up sharply . Larger mills now are getting from $55 to $60 a thousand feet for kiln-dried lumber which they eold for $50 in June . And they get $50 for air-dried lumber that was sold for $44 and $45 in June . Many smaller mills , however , have n't been able to boost prices , or have raised less than the big companies .. Pine manufacturers welcome higher prices . of course , in their battle with rising costs . Other than a slight drop in log prices , all costs remain high ; some are still mounting . One big cost factor is the lumber drying process . Kiln drying costs between $3 and $6 per thousand . One Montana manufacturer put his kilning cost at $3 60 per thousand board feet . including steam , power , repairs . and sorting after drying . Air drying costs about $5 per thousand . Kiln drying takes about 24 hours for a quarter-inch piece of lumber , lip to 96 hours for the thicker boards . Two weeks is needed to kiln-dry a four-inch piece of select lumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 3.5 million to 4 million feet a year . The lumber is wheeled into the kiln on dollies , where steam heat forces out the moisture which is dried out by circulating fans . The costs of constructing dry kilns has increased steeply . One pine mill , in the process of building five standard kilns , reports a cost of $22.000 for each unit . In pre-war days . it would have been about about $14,000 per unit Sheds , to protect the lumber until shipping , now cost 530.000 , double pre- , ivar . Tics lt-p the Money What makes air drying costly is that . in addition to requiring yard space , time , and much handling , it involves an investment in huge stocks of lumber . For example , pine now being cut at the higher elevations for air drying , wo n't be ready for market until early spring . That means that a small mill . cutting only about 20 million feet yearly , must carry from 8 to 10 million feet in stock . That ties up a lot of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with dry kilning facilities , would need only 3 to 4 million in inventories . For air drying , lumber is stacked in piles from 12 to 24 feet in height . At least two inches of space is left between each piece 1 of lumber , and stacks are never closer than ; three feet . It usually takes hand labor to stack the lumber and to unstack it , Ialthough many of the larger mills use auto ' mane loaders . Wages paid to workers in pine mills are more than twice as high as pre-war . The average hourly rate went from 71 cents its 1939 to $1.58 in 1947 , and up to ** now . Log Price Pattern Logs also cost far more than pre-war . The average price for stumpage ( trees standing in a forest ) was $3 46 a thousand feet in 1939 ; it was $6.41 in 1947 and kept on up to $9.28 in 3948 , but has shown a slight decline this year . A pine mill that made money at low prices is one that acquired timber at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states of Washington and Montana . estimates that in one area its own Ponderosa stumpage cost only $2 76 . When the firm had to buy neighbot ing stumpage from the government , the cost was $12.50 . Another endless worry of pine men is rail freight rates . They must deliver their finished product in the Chicago area , for example , as low-priced as possible to compete with southern pine . The thousand feet of lumber that in 1939 traveled from Spokane , Wash. , to Chicago for $13.68 now pays $20.52 to make the same trip . In addition to the always-present competition from southern pine , western producers also look with a worried eye on 750 million feet of spruce that is imported annually from Canada . Maybe more will come in now that Canada has devalued its dollar And then there 's about 200 million feet of Ponderosa pine that comes in from Mexico .
