In Rome last week , while newsmen shot questions at him , Prime Minister Winston Churchill sat down on an open barrel of political TNT and calmly lit a cigar . He had arrived in Italy four days before the Allied armada invaded southern France , three days after the sudden arrival of Yugoslavia 's Marshal Tito . Since then he had talked to Tito , to Italy 's Premier Ivanoe Bonomi , Marshal Badoglio , Lieutenant of the Realm Prince Umberto , to Pope Pius XII . These talks might have concerned military plans . They almost certainly concerned the future plans of Britain and Russia in the Balkans , in Italy , in the eastern Mediterranean . In the case of Pope Pius XII , they concerned Poland . The newsmen wanted to know what had been said . Winston Churchill had his own reasons for not telling . <P> " Mr. Prime Minister ! Mr. Prime Minister ! What did you and Bonomi talk about ? " <P> ( It was almost the fifth anniversary of the beginning of World War II . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Nazis , he had said : " ' I have nothing to offer but blood , toil , tears and sweat . . . . " ' ) <P> Winston Churchill looked at the newsmen , chewed at his cigar , belched smoke , said nothing . <P> " Mr. Prime Minister ! Mr. Prime Minister ! What did you and Badoglio talk about ? " <P> ( Then Dunkirk had come and Britain stood alone against totalitarian might and night . The cigar chewer had said : " . . . We shall defend our island , whatever the cost may be , we shall fight on the beaches , we shall fight on the landing grounds , we shall fight in the fields and in the streets , we shall fight in the hills ; we shall never surrender , and even if , which I do not for a moment believe , this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving , then our empire beyond the seas , armed and guarded by the British Fleet , would carry on the struggle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all its power and might , steps forth to the rescue and liberation of the Old . " ) <P> Winston Churchill looked at the newsmen , puffed at his cigar , said nothing . <P> " Mr. Prime Minister ! Mr. Prime Minister ! What did you and Pope Pius talk about ? " <P> ( Then had come the Battle of Britain . <P> A handful of men &lt; &; boys had gone up with wings and , though outnumbered , was fighting the Luftwaffe to a standstill . Was not that aerial battle the Marathon of World War II ? " Never . . . " the cigar-chewer had said , " was so much owed by so many to so few . " ) <P> Winston Churchill squinted at the questioning newsmen , lit his second cigar , said nothing . <P> " Mr. Prime Minister ! Mr. Prime Minister ! What-did you and Marshal Tito talk about ? " <P> ( Then , in the deepening darkness , the battle of the dinosaurs began-Germany leaped at the throat of Russia . The cigar chewer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he spoke to the world over the air : " Any man or state who fights on against Nazidom will have our aid . Any man or state who marches with Hitler is our foe . " ) <P> Winston Churchill , 69 , puffed at his cigar , looked at the newsmen , said nothing .
