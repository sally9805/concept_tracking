The City Coffee Shop <P> Sirs : <P> I 've been in the Army for four years , and seen the public reaction change from " We must do all we can for the boys , " to " What ! Another damn soldier ! " Today I had my faith restored . . . . <P> While enroute to a new station I stopped in the little town of Braman , Okla. ( pop . 427 ) and entered the City Coffee Shop . . . . When I asked the proprietor for the check , he informed me that there were no charges . <P> Amazed , I asked for an explanation , and then he ( Mr. Carl Iman ) stated that he had not charged a man in uniform for a meal since the bombing of Pearl Harbor . . . . <P> He feeds anywhere from five to ten servicemen a day , whether they order a sandwich or a steak dinner . <P> I 've saluted many an officer , but none with more sincerity than the salute I gave Carl Iman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kan . <P> American Abroad <P> Sirs : <P> Your timely statement on Lend-Lease ( TIME , Nov. 22 ) covers but briefly the situation under so much discussion by wiseacre stay-at-homes . . . . <P> When I was shipped out to India quite early in the war , I must admit that I , along with my brother officers and enlisted men , openly ridiculed the men of the British forces . <P> . . . We had absolutely no valid reason for such an attitude other than that of the average American at home who so easily be littles everything and everybody not American . . . . <P> What an acute about-face we all made . . . . <P> In India I was stationed in the Sind desert for a tour . . . . We lived in British tents , ate British field rations . . . . Improvements to our camp were made by Indian coolies . We discarded the sorry sun helmets issued by the Army , as well as the unbearably hot G.I. khaki and wore British topees and summer battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central India command . . . . There , our troops were quartered in British-built barracks . The officers lived in grand style in hotels for the ridiculous sum of 52 rupees a month . <P> Our sick were cared for in the British military hospital . We drove British ambulances , used their gasoline , rode their bicycles , ate the Indian food which some unusually smart quartermaster obtained by hiring an Indian agent to buy for us in open market . <P> When I was hospitalized , the whole layout had been planned , engineered and built by the British with coolie labor . Our diet was Indian with some British and a very pitifully small amount of American food added . The medical supplies would have been appallingly inadequate at times had it not been for the British supplies . <P> I was returned to the States on a British troop ship . <P> The members of the various branches of the British armed forces were certainly the best of companions on the long voyage home , and I believe I made some friendships that will pay dividends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American troops in the China-Burma-Indian theater are deeply indebted to the British . <P> ( SERVICEMAN 'S NAME WITHHELD ) <P> Fort Lauderdale , Fla . <P> Farmer , Fill the Flowing Bowl <P> Sirs : <P> Having just read your summation of the liquor situation ( TIME , Nov. 15 ) , I am obligated to suggest a way out .
