txt WASHINGTON , Feb. 18 ? Edwin G. Nourse , chief economic adviser to President Truman , today - characterized the current business situation as one of " disinflation " that was healthy unless the public became " jittery . " His summation was given at the White House after he had called on Mr. Truman , who had said yesterday at a news conference that prices seemed to be leveling off . Dr. Nourse carefully explained that he did not wish to seem in disagreement with the President but he thought the term leveling-off implied a drift of prices to a definite point , a factor he does not foresee . Dr. Nourse continued his explanation by saying that " dis-inflation " was taking pressure from inflation , while deflation would mean a ' general collapse . The aim now , he added , was to achieve a workable set of price relationships " which we would believe to be below the peak of inflation but above the general level of the pre-war period . " This estimate ? of the business situation impressed many as being closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee on the Economic Report , which closed today a fortnight of hearings . ? Views Voiced at Hearings At these hearings , conducted by Senator Joseph C. O'Mahoney of Wyoming , as chairman of the joint committee , about thirty prominent spokesmen for Government , industry , labor and agriculture have testified as to the desirability , or vice versa , . of the broad program advanced by President Truman in his " anti-inflation " campaign . These measures include extension of credit controls , continued rent and export controls and a set of reserve powers , written into a bill introduced earlier this week . These would virtually authorize the President to re-impose wartime regulations governing production , distribution and wage payments in the fields of scarce commodities . Out of the hearings a general pattern has come involving gen ? eral support for the President 's program , or major parts of it , by spokesmen for labor and agriculture , and rather general opposition by business spokesmen . Today 's hearings saw James B. Carey , speaking for the Congress of Industrial Organizations , and Lewis Hines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in support of the whole program . With them in full support stood James G. Patton of the National Farmers Union . Endorsements of some proposals were given . by Albert Goss , speaking for the National Grange , and Roger Fleming of the American Farm Bureau Federation , who asited for strong supports under farm prices but who appeared to question the price-fixing and wage , fixing phases of the program . None of the business spokesmen opposed the program as a whole , but at the same time none approved the specific bill to grant to Mr. Truman extraordinary powers to fix prices and wages in peacetime . Criticisms by Business Philip Reed , speaking for the General Electric Company , ques , tioned the validity of estimates for foreign aid . He particularly criticized plans to spend relatively little on the information part of the foreign program in ? comparison with the Economic Cooperation Administration and planned arms lend-lease budgets . Emerson Schmidt , representing the United States Chamber of // By Winston Churchill : The Second World War Installment 14 of the excerpts from Mr .. Churchill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page 17 BUSINESS IN PERIOD OF DIS-INFLATION ' // Commerce , and RaIp/ W. Robey , for the National Association of Manufacturers , raised the question whether the pending program would not itself generate dangerous fears . S. Abbott Smith c the Smaller Business Association of New England , and Meyer Kestnbaum , president of the Hart , Schaffner and Marx Company , opposed strongly any program to fix prices generally , if at all . Ten witnesses appeared today before the joint committee in a round-table session . All made brief statements and joined in an interchange of views in an atmosphere as informal as possible . The key to the discussion was set by Senator O'Mahoney in the question , " Does the Government have a function to perform ? " Mr. Reed said of the proposed control measure that " nothing could be more drastically influnetial than this bill , " because " it is wrong on its merits and in its substance , and very much more wrong in its climate . " The Government could accomplish most , he went on , " by reasserting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " by encouraging self-reliance and resourcefulness . " Discussing the budget , with its implied need for more taxes to finance the Administration 's program , Mr. Reed said he was not convinced that so much money need be spent on the arms program and on European recovery . He urged that these programs be studied carefully , and that if lendlease arms were sent to Europe they be held to $1,000,000,000 in value . He said this total might be saved from current estimates for the cost of next year 's operation of the recovery program . Mr. Reed said also that General Electric had not encountered the grave shortages in steel and other materials pictured by other witnesses . He added that the company was spending $30,000,000 on new generating equipment . He predicted that the power-development programs scheduled for 1949 and 1950 would solve existing national shortages . Mr. Schmidt attacked the pricecontrol theory on the ground that it " over-stimulates demand " at a time when " the function of a free leconomy is to discover the proper relationship between prices and supplies . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an answer to the problems that we face . " Kestnbaum , whose business is particularly close to consumers , predicted that the present " inflationary period " would give way to readjustment . " A further round of wage raises , " he asserted , " would be disastrous . In the long run the price trend will be slowly downward . There has been a certain softening in the consumer goods lines . In industries where business is competitive these conditions are solving themselves . " Labor and Farm Support Mr. Carey told the committee , on the other hand , that the whole program was " in keeping with the declared policy of this country Calling for full employment , full production and ful consumption . " To this Mr. Hines added : " We are for the President 's objective 100 per cent . The most essential method of achievement is cooperation of all elements . " Mr. Smith , speaking for the small business men , smilingly noted that his seat at the table placed him " between the General Electric Company and the National Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulatory legislation . " Frankly , as I read the bill I do n't like it , " he said more seriously . " If you 'll just give us a healthy business climate we 'll stand on our own feet and do all right . "
