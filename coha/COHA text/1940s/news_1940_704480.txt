txt False Economy Deplored Decreasing School Budget Regarded as One Example of It To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : No group in the community is more concerned with the Governor 's budget for 1940-41 than the parents . As constituting the largest aggregation of taxpayers and homeowners , they naturally share the common responsibility of all citizens in insuring that expenditures be not needlessly swollen and that money is spent ' n right directions . More than ever before , budgets , both State and city , are now menaced , and will be in days to come by mounting costs for police services , hospitals and correctional institutions which are , at best , but curative agencies . The parents do not accept these increasing expenditures fatalistically as inevitable and inescapable , but on the contrary insist that they are in large measure unnecessary and avoidable . Believing in prevention rather than cure , they are convinced that by checking incipient crime , preventing ill health and maintaining adequate recreational facilities , much money to be spent now and in the future to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for constructive purposes . It ' is for this reason , primarily , that parents are so anxious to see both State and city support to the full the requirements of- the Board of Education , a body charged with such large responsibilities for the welfare of the people . Should the State budget be cut the Board will be helpless , for ' the city has reached practically the limit of its now- ' ers of taxation . The Board of Education can economize only by reducing or eliminating the few services which are not Mandatory . These include all those educative and social agencies which presage so much for the improvement or deteriora ? tion of our citizens . Adolescents , for the most part , will be unable to prepare themselves in night schools for future careers ; remedial health services will go ; school buildings will . be barred at night against recreational and community activities ; newcomers in our midst will be denied opportunities for Americanization . In fact , just those very services which make for a decent citizenry and counter ill health and crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can possibly be justified by any man or woman willing to see the picture as a whole . A shortsighted cut in the educational budget now must inevitably spell increased expenditures in the future to correct the harm that will certainly be done . Under the circumstances , it seems to me inevitable that the Ways and Means Committee of the Assembly must seek again a source of revenue for supporting full educational needs without taking the easiest path of additional taxation , ' or of penalizing the schools . WHEELER B. PRESTON , President , United Parents Associations of New York City , Inc . New York , Jan. 31 , 1940 : Courtesy on Downward Path Women Are Blamed for the Condition Against Which They Inveigh TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : To the Madcos brothers from Vermont , who lament the passing of chivalry , may I say that I , too , was once a young man and invariably gave my seat to a woman , young or old , pretty or . plain . But in those days it was regarded as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tougher and more metallic generation of females expects the seat as a matter of right . If she gets it , well and good ; if not , she does her best to show that she has been abused . More important , however : in former days , girls and young women invariably relinquished their seats to older men and women , to parents with infants , to crippled . people . Not long ago I was sitting in a subway car , the only man in my half of the car . A man entered using a crutch . Not one of the twenty young women and girls offered him her seat , and some of them even looked at me . Well , I did get up , and the moment I did a young woman who had been holding her young son on her lap squeezed him next to her , thus forcing all the others to make way until the place I had just vacated was taken up . What is the result ? I have simply stopped these courtesies to women , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy and consideration themselves , in acknowledging these favors from men and in sacrificing their own seats to older women and older men , to cripples , or to burdened parents , am I going to change . Who is to blame for this passing of chivalry ? I do n't know , but it seems to me that if women want their daughters to receive courtesies they must teach them to deserve them . HERMAN A. KARSIE .

Tariff in Restraint of Trade To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : What may seem to be a minor detail in the letter of Ernest Flagg msty be of major importance in the consideration of our national tariff policy . I refer to his passing comment on the misleading use of the term " protection . " It is a historical fact that this term was introduced by those who would benefit by excluding imports which competed with their higher-priced domestic products . If protection to American industry , to American labor and to the American people meant what the phrases suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nobody could reasonably oppose it . But it really means helping some at the cost and to the injury of others . Protection is thus a question-begging word . It carries its own desired answer in the argument . The word " restriction " is colorless and strictly accurate as a description of whit is done and its purpose . Imports ' of merchandise and services are not free gifts to Us . Every dollar 's worth of imports must eventually be paid for with a dollar 's worth of exports . If some domestic productions are stimulated by tariffs , others are hampered . We might ask ourselves whether we are in favor of restricting American industry , labor and trade . If we would think clearly on this question , let us quit using the question-begging word , " protection . " Let us call it what it truly is , " restriction . " Then let those who are in favor of it , say so . FRANK ALBERT FETTER . Princeton , N. J. , Jan. 29 , 1940 . Christianity in Germany Consul General Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your writer in today 's Topics of The Times deserves credit for an admirable measure of dialectics in contrasting Adolf Hitler 's and my own recent citations of the Bible . I also gratefully acknowledge his implied gentle hint that I might have gone too far out on a limb by reporting that the Bible is a better seller in Germany than " Mein Kampf . " It was kind of him to overlook the fact that I further jeopardized my position by saying that the German attitude during the last seven years has not been without mistakes . According to the vast majority of printed accounts on German conditions , I should now at least be prepared to be recalled immediately and to be " purged . " Yet , while I am still alive in New York , may I not be permitted to suggest that Adolf Hitler and myself might have had two different yet completely consistent thoughts in mind . Certainly , Adolf Hitler is not the first to have pointed out that the nation which gave birth to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatrical talent in the political field . Great Britain 's " carrying of the white man 's burden " is a case in point . My statement , however , that the Bible is the best seller in Germany should be read in connection with some further remarks made in the same speech ? namely : 1 . That the National Socialist party program states expressly in Article 24 that the German State is a Christian State . 2 . That , according to statistics , ecclesiastical institutions in Germany since 1933 have grown in numbers . 3 . That circulation of religious publications has increased . 4 . That Germany has struggled for centuries to the best of her power for the true spirit and essence of Christianity . even to the shedding of her blood . 5 . That her churches to this day are reported to be as full as ever . Was I really hasty in concluding from the foregoing that it is not an altogether fair statement to accuse the Germans of being anti-Christian ? DR . H. BORCHERS , German Consul General . New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK . TIMES : - When I. recently visited La Guardia Field I was impressed by its many novel features and its immense size . The only thing that impressed me unfavorably was the airport 's inaccessibility . True , it has bus and trolley service , but many faults can be found with each of these services . I therefore tried to think of some way to provide modern high-speed rapid transit service to this wonderful airport . It became clear that the Independent System could provide such a service by extending the World 's Fair spur direct to the airport . The advantages of such service are increased speed , both passenger and mail ; a higher degree of safety than present service ; rapid transit service to a section of the city not served now ; reliable transportation for passenger , visitor , employe and resident ; additional employment ; more convenient and less confusing than present service ; provide revenue to the city by charging 5-cent fare on the spur ; help the airport increase its revenue and prestige . WALTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use of Term Red Mass Held Correct TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I was disturbed by the letter in THE NEW YORK TIMES of Jan. 25 criticizing the term red mass and a further sentence in THE TIMES 'S account . The term red mass is well known and has been in use for centuries in France and England , and more recently in the United States , to designate , as THE TIMES 'S account stated , the mass of the Holy Ghost , which is celebrated on the occasion of the opening of the courts . The additional sentence , which was the subject of criticism , might be misleading if taken from the context . But taken in the context the statement could not be fairly regarded as offensive . : ROBERT J. WHITE , Dean , School of Law , Catholic University of America . Chicago , Feb. 1 , 1940 .
