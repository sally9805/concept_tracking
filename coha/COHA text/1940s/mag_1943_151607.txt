In a shop ten feet wide , surrounded by seven pawnbrokers and nine saloons , black-haired Herb Luhn , 49 , proprietor of the San Francisco Camera Exchange , last week went on being successful in a fantastic way . In normal times his customers ( " They 're all nuts , they only talk about photography " ) wait on one another , wrap purchases , ring up the cash register without disturbing him , use his telephone . They patronize no one else because there is no one like him and no shop like his ( they have made it a meeting place , a center for the exchange of information ) . <P> His showcases , bought secondhand before World War I , are broken , his shelves filled with bullet-dented Japanese helmets and other war mementos sent him by some 70 ex-customers now in the services ( he spends an hour a day writing to them ) . The floor is covered with candy wrappers , bottle tops , memos he writes to himself and periodically dumps out of his pockets . ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Thursday we missed .

Oh , sometimes they die , but usually they show up and pay . " <P> San Francisco 's earthquake jolted Storekeeper Luhn out of the fifth grade , set him to selling newspapers .

Now he deals chiefly with the Army , Navy and war industries . To one customer recently Luhn said : " You want film and I have none . But you like my necktie . Here it is . No charge . " Storekeeper Luhn and Stabilizer Brady are doing well . Last year they grossed $100,000 in this shop , expect this year to do 50% more .
