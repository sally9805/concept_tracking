The world found out last week who led the daring , destructive noonday air raid on Japan last month . To the White House , to receive a Congressional Medal of Honor , went pugnacious Brigadier General James Harold Doolittle , 45 , speed flyer , engineer , scholar and man of action . <P> Standing at attention while Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall intoned the formal citation , lean-faced , balding Jimmy Doolittle bent forward while President Roosevelt pinned the gold , blue-ribboned medal above his left shirt pocket . Not even a columnist , chortled the President , had known the identity of the raid 's leader . <P> Said the New York Daily News : " He should be named Doomuch . " <P> With Both Feet . On the day of Pearl Harbor , Jimmy Doolittle , then a major , told friends at Los Angeles Municipal Airport : " I 'm going to get in this thing with both feet . I 'm going to Tokyo with a load of bombs . " Doolittle , who once demonstrated a commercial plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no braggart . Now , having made good , he told Washington newsmen about his deed of derring-doolittle in formal Army lingo : <P> " The success of the raid exceeded our most optimistic expectations . " South of Tokyo he left in flames a cruiser or battleship under construction at the Navy yard . At Nagoya he showered incendiary bombs on the Mitsubishi airplane factory and an oil-tank farm . " It appeared to us that practically every bomb reached the target for which it was intended . . . . About 25 or 30 miles to sea the rear gunners reported seeing columns of smoke rising thousands of feet in the air . " <P> The twin-motored 6-25s were flown just over the housetops . It would have been no trick to hit Hirohito 's palace , but Doolittle had given specific instructions : do n't bomb it . " I think several of us dropped bombs within sight of it . " The Doolittle plane was attacked by nine Jap fighters , but he rapidly outdistanced them all . Not an American plane was lost ( the Japs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doolittle , were all nominated for the Distinguished Service Cross . Still undisclosed was the American planes 's base . Unhumorously reporting a heavy Roosevelt jest , the Berlin radio solemnly announced : " Doolittle carried out the attack from the air base at Shangri-La , which was not otherwise described by Roosevelt . " <P> Quiet Birdman . Stocky , nerveless Jimmy Doolittle set at least a dozen speed records , owns almost all the important aviation trophies . But he is far more than a speed and a stunt flyer . Doolittle has been a ceaseless air experimenter : in 1929 he made the first complete blind flight . A second lieutenant in World War I , he chafed at being kept at San Diego as an instructor . He was an early member of the Quiet Birdmen , the group of flyers who set themselves apart from the kiwi , an almost , extinct flightless bird , and from the " modock , " legendary aviation term for a " bird that flies backwards to keep the dust out of its eyes .
