txt Bananas Available in Harlem In your issue of Aug. 6 , Dr. Sidney V. Haas expresses considerable anxiety over the possibility of being unable to Procure bananas for the treatment of celiac disease . This topic was brought to the attention of the public recently when the Police Department made a frantic effort to obtain a small supply of bananas for a Brooklyn child suffering from this disease . This situation puzzles me . I reside in Harlem , and I have noticed that practically every fruit store and every fruit stand has a plentiful supply of this fruit . I have been buying bananas almost daily without any difficulty , and it seems to me that if Harlem dealers can obtain bananas , the same facilities should be available to other sections of our City . SADIE MELTON . New York , Aug. 7 , 1942.
