txt  | Early Papermaking Processes and Methods THE METHODS that were used in the making of paper during the early centuries of the craft are naturally vague after a lapse of almost two thousand years . No records indicate to us the manner in which the Chinese first made paper ; but as with the ancient arts of the weaver and the potter , the method of hand fabrication in this craft must have changed but little from its inception to the present day . Almost two thousand years ago sheets of paper were made from disintegrated fibre upon flat moulds , and in this fashion paper is still formed , the only difference being in the treatment of the fibre and in the construction of the moulds ; in principle the process remains unchanged . The original papermakers of China probably poured the fibrous pulp upon the cloth-covered frames , or moulds , but it was not long before the craftsmen practised the more expeditious method of dipping the moulds directly into the macerated liquid material . This change of method was one of the important steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to form better sheets of paper , but to produce them in greater quantity . There is no way of arriving at the exact period when moulds were first dipped , but it probably did not take the ingenious Chinese a great while to discover the new and more efficient method . The pouring of the fibrous stock upon the moulds is still practised in Tibet , Burma , Nepal , Bhutan , Siam , l and some parts of China . ( See Figures 41 , 90 , 91 . ) Whatever the methods employed in the Orient at the inception of papermaking , the method used when the craft was introduced into Spain during the twelfth century was to dip the mould into a vat filled with macerated liquid pulp and bring it to the surface laden with the matted and felted fibre , which , after drying , was paper . In the four centuries following there was little development in papermaking . Before the invention of printing in Europe the use of paper was limited , but with the ushering in of this art the craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the fif-  | teenth century that the fabrication of paper developed into a notable industry , and present-day interest in old papermaking dates from the infancy of printing rather than from more remote periods . The precise methods used by papermakers in the days of Gutenberg , Jenson , and Caxton are no more clear to us than are the exact processes employed by the early printers in their type-making . The oldest print in either the Orient or the Occident representing an interior view of a paper mill ( Figure 146 ) is that of Jost Amman , ' from the year 1568 , but this woodcut throws no more light on the details of papermaking than does the print of the old typefoundry , in the same volume and by the same artist , show us how type was made at that time . It is only by piecing together material from many and varied sources that we are able to arrive at the methods used by the early craftsmen . The art of papermaking was jealously guarded by the old workers , and , there being little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papermakers in each locality should have had their own methods . Even today there is a secrecy among the makers of handmade paper in both the Orient and the Occident , and the various mills show a pronounced variation in equipment and methods of operation . In an examination of old Asiatic and European paper it may be readily perceived that the sheets were formed upon flat moulds , and from the impressions left in the paper by the material of which these moulds were made , it is not difficult to determine how the moulds were constructed . The moulds differed slightly in work- footnote * The print may be found in a book of trades issued in Frankfurt am Main under the title : Eygentliche Beschreibung aller Stande auff Erden , hoher and nidriger , geistlicher and weltlicher , aller Kiinsten , Handwercken and Hlindeln ( 1568 ) . In this little book 115 trades or callings are pictured by Jost Amman ( 1539 ? 91 ) ; under each woodcut there is a verse about the particular craft compiled by Hans Sachs ( 1494-1576 ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eighteenth in the book and follows the illustration depicting the woodcutter at work . A translation of the verse by Hans Sachs reads : Rags are brought unto my mill Where much water turns the wheel , They are cut and torn and shredded , To the pulp is water added ; Then the sheets ' twixt felts must lie While I wring them in my press . Lastly , hang them up to dry Snow-white in glossy loveliness.  | manship in the various countries and localities , and therefore we have inherited in documents , manuscripts , and books innumerable varieties of paper , defying classification ; yet it is clear that the fundamental principles of both mould construction and the actual  | making of the paper have undergone few changes since the original invention by the Chinese . In all old European paper mills , aside from the appliances that were used in the preparation of the pulp or paper stock ( described in Chapter v ) , there were four essential utensils used : the vat , the moulds , the felts , and the press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' art these four necessary appliances will be seen . In the fifteenth century the vat for holding the fibrous liquid was simply a round or oblong wooden tub , about five feet in breadth , reaching in height to the worker 's waist , and bound with stout hoops . The old vats were probably made from huge wine casks or tuns cut through the centre , as it is not likely that there were special shops where papermaking equipment was manufactured . Doubtless the mills designed and constructed their own appliances to suit their individual needs ( Figure 147 ) . The earliest engraving representing papermaking shows no appurtenances to the vats , but during the seventeenth century several inventions were made which greatly facilitated the work . The most important of these was the introduction of the charcoal heater , which was annexed to the back of the vat to warm the stock . By the more rapid evaporation that resulted the workers were enabled to make a greater number of sheets in a day . In France this heater was known as a " pistolet , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outside wall so that the smoke from the heater or grate would not permeate the vat-house and soil the paper during the moulding process. * In pioneer papermaking in America the vat was heated in much the same manner . The only contemporary description of this old footnote * The earliest British patent pertaining to the heating of vats for papermaking was issued to William Scott and George Gregory on August 16 , 1793 . The specification reads : " Their invention is for heating water and other stuff in vats for making paper by introducing steam . . . . The common and ordinary method now used for heating water and other stuff in vats for making paper is by introducing fuel into a pan placed within the vat , which not only consumes a large quantity of coal , but is likewise uncertain and irregular in the heat . . . the new method causes the paper to be free from a great part of the dust and nastiness which unavoidably mix with it from heating the vats by fuel . " The specification is accompanied by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of coils of pipe protruding directly into the dipping-vats . This is the same method of heating the paper stock as is employed at the present time in the commercial handmade-paper mills of Europe .  | method of warming the stock in the vat is that given in the manuscript diary of Ebenezer Hiram Stedman , who was born in Dorchester , Massachusetts , November 11 , 1808 . In 1816 young Stedman and his father , a Massachusetts papermaker , migrated to Kentucky to work in a paper mill in Lexington . The account of young Stedman 's trials with the " pistolet " is taken from this exceedingly interesting old diary . Stedman wrote : " From January till May I would have to get up in the mornings at 2 o'clock , the first thing was to make a fire to warm the water in the vat , where they dipt up the pulp to form the sheets of paper . I had to go into a hole on my hands and knees , ten feet long , by three feet square , to make a fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the hole I went in and this was on the outside of the mill . Exposed to the weather in winter no one will ever realize how much I suffered with cold , snow , rain , and smoke . Many times I have had to hold my breath while making the fire and dodge in for a chance to put in a stick of wood , then back out for the place was too small to turn around . After making the fire then I would have to wake up the vatman and the coucher and the other workmen in the paper mill . " Another improvement in the equipment was a platform or bridge which extended from one side of the vat to the other . This bridge , as shown in the old engravings , supported the " horn , " against which the mould with its newly formed sheet was placed to drain . The bridge does not appear in the woodcut of 1568 by Jost Amman , nor in the illustration of 1662 by Georg Andrew Bockler ( Figures 136 and 146 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a very crude woodcut of 1658,2 it may have been in use as early as Buckler 's time in some parts of Europe . During the process of moulding the sheets of paper it was essential that the fibrous material be kept from settling to the bottom of the dipping-vat . Originally this was accomplished by the action of a pole in the hands of a workman , a means of agitation still used in most Oriental mills . A slight improvement was later made by placing on the end of the pole a wooden disk pierced with holes , which increased the effectiveness of the stirring . Suggestions for more efficient work came slowly in the early mills , and each step , which now seems trivial , was no doubt welcomed as an ingenious invention by the old craftsmen . It was not until the latter part of the eighteenth century that a mechanical agitator was  | devised , and even this went through various changes before the paddle-wheel , called a " hog , " was finally adopted and used almost universally . ? footnote * The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not show the mechanical agitator , so it may be assumed that this means of preventing the paper stock from settling in the vat was not employed on the Continent previous to this date . The earliest mention of this form of agitation that can be located appears in an article entitled " Sur les papeteries et fabrication de papier-paille en Angleterre " in Annales des arts et manufactures , ou Memoires technologiques , October ? November 1803 . The article relates to a visit of a French papermaker to the Matthias Koops paper mills , Mill Bank , Westminster , England . The description reads : " The vats in nearly all the English paper mills are fitted with agitators placed near the bottom , to which is given a slow motion . This agitator , or paddle-wheel , which the English have given the name hog , ' keeps the macerated stock in the vat in constant movement and prevents it from settling to the bottom of the vat.  | The first European method of supplying the vat was by transferring the macerated stock from the storage chest by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' It was not until the seventeenth century that a supply by gravity was devised . I once visited a paper mill in Europe that had been equipped in the late eighteenth century , where the fibrous liquid had been conveyed to the vat from a large stone cistern by means of a long winding wooden trough ; the stock or pulp had been lifted and thrown into this trough by a huge wooden wheel fitted with copper buckets . After the vat had been filled to within a few inches of its brim with the diluted linen and cotton fibres that had been macerated under the stamping-mills , the fibrous material was ready to be formed into sheets of paper . A workman ( Figures 148,149 ) , called a vatman , stood on a platform in front of the vat , holding a mould firmly by the two narrow sides ; around this mould was a removable deckle or frame , which acted in the manner of a shallow fence around its edges . ( Moulds and deckles are described in detail in Chapter iv . ) The vatman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fibrous liquid substance , and when the mould was well submerged he turned it face upwards and lifted it horizontally from the vat . By this action the mould was evenly covered with the macerated linen and cotton , and the stock not needed for the particular weight or thickness of paper being moulded was allowed to run over the far edge of the mould into the vat , to be used again . The vatman then shook the newly formed sheet on the surface of the mould , first from right to left , then from back to front . These motions crossed and matted the fibres , making the sheets of paper almost equally strong in both directions , and at the same time expelling considerable water from the sheet . The wires of the mould retained the fibres , but allowed the water to drain through as in a sieve . The vatman then removed It is due to a great extent to this invention that the English paper possesses a uniform blueness from the smalt colouring as without the agitator the colour ( dye ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds the colouring in suspension in the liquid fibre and assures the high quality of the English blue paper . " e This method of supplying the vats with stock is practised in the Orient ; even in the most efficient handmade-paper mills of Japan the pulp is placed in the vats without the help of mechanical means .  | the wooden deckle , which left the moist sheet of paper , cut sharply along its four edges , upon the mould . The next operation of the vatman was to pass the mould along the bridge to the second artisan , known as the " coucher , " and proceed to form another sheet with a second mould , using the same deckle . The coucher placed the mould , with its thin moist sheet , against the inclined drainagehorn , or " asp , " which allowed the surplus water to drain back into the vat . When the wet sheet of paper had solidified upon the mould to the proper extent ? a stage determined by a distinctive lustre over its surface ? the coucher turned the mould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of felting ( Figure 150 ) . The couching was done with a quick , deft motion , rocking the mould from one long edge to the other , leaving the sheet , flat and unwrinkled , upon the woollen cloth . These processes were repeated over and over , the vatman and coucher working together , until a pile of 144 sheets of paper had been formed and couched , each sheet of wet paper separated from the next by a piece of felt somewhat larger than the size of the paper . The  | pile of six quires was termed a " post , " and the next operation was to place the post in a press to expel the excess water. $ ? In the earliest form of Chinese papermaking the sheets were dried directly upon the woven textile moulds upon which they had been formed , so that couching , or removing the paper from the mould while wet , was not required ( Figure 151 ; see also Figures 42-46 ) . After the introduction in China of the " laid " bamboo mould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to couch each sheet as it was formed , one upon another without interleaving cloths . This method is in use at the present time in many parts of Asia , including China , Japan , Korea , Indo-China , and India . ' At the introduction of papermaking into Europe , felt of some kind was in all probability used as a material for the couching of paper . It is not likely that the old craftsmen employed woven wool cloth such as the makers of handmade paper use at present , but a more compact , matted substance of hair or wool . The woven material that is used by modern papermakers is called felt , but the name is a misnomer , as felt is a compressed mass and does not necessarily consist of warp and weft . Years ago in Catholic countries the feltmakers celebrated the 23rd of November , St. Clement 's Day , with a great festival . It is stated that this saint , when on a pilgrimage , placed carded wool between his feet and the soles footnote * The term " post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by felts ; the origin of the word is obscure . While the usual number of newly moulded sheets in a post was six quires , the amount would vary according to the size of the paper being made ; with paper of large dimensions the post would be made up of as many sheets as could be handled and pressed conveniently . The term " post " may have been introduced into England by German or Italian workers as the word probably came originally from the German Posten or Italian posto , which in turn were derived from the Latin positum . The term " quire " ( Middle English quaer , quair ; Old French quayer , quaer , cayer , caier ; French cahier ; Low Latin quaternus , quaternum , from the Latin quaterni ) denotes four sheets of paper or parchment folded together into eight leaves ; hence any set of folded sheets fitting one within another , as the sheets of a book . The modern use of the term quire is usually applied to twenty-four sheets of paper , either folded or unfolded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty quires , or 480 sheets . This term comes from the Arabic word rizmah , meaning a bundle , especially of paper . The term was probably introduced into Spain along with the craft of papermaking in the twelfth century , where the word became rezma or resma . The Middle English term was reme ; Old French rayme ; French rame . According to Webster , a regulation ream is 480 sheets , but sometimes 472 of drawing or handmade paper , 500 sheets of news or book paper , and a printer 's " perfect ream " 516 sheets .  | of his sandals , and at the end of his journey found that the wool had been converted into felt . However , the invention of felt by St. Clement is to be questioned , as this material was in use long before his time . The Greeks manufactured true felt as early as 900 B.c. , long before the art of papermaking.5 Papyrus was made before this period , it is true , but this is a laminated substance , not made from macerated and disintegrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Romans made use of matted felt for caps , blankets , and the lining of helmets . Since the material was thicker than common cloth , it presented a more effectual obstacle to missile weapons ; hence when the soldiers under Julius Caesar were annoyed by Pompey 's archers , they made shirts of heavy felt and wore them for defence . The Scythians , who from the most remote time roamed the lands of northern Asia , as did the Tatars , their successors , used felt for both clothing and material for making tents . It is therefore quite evident that had the early papermakers , even the original Chinese , desired felt for the couching of their paper , it could have been readily procured .  | It is not known when felt came into use as a material for receiving the wet sheets of paper as they were couched from the moulds , nor is it known when woven wool cloth was substituted for matted felting for the couching of paper , but it is probable that some sort of woven material was in use for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special wool cloths were fabricated for papermaking until the eighteenth century , although there was an incorporated company of feltmakers in England as early as 1604 . These artisans made felt for hats , but it is not recorded that they attempted any woven or matted material especially for papermakers . The material used for the making of felt was not only wool , but the hair of the seal , rabbit , monkey , goat , and camel . The best description of woven cloth such as was used in the eighteenth century by the makers of paper is furnished by Nicolas Desmarets in Traite de fart de fabriquer le papier , published in Paris in 1788 : The felts have two surfaces furnished with different naps . That side which has the longest nap is applied to the couched sheets , and on the side with the shortest the fresh leaves are laid . If this arrangement of the felting was changed , and the sheets laid upon the surface with a long nap , not only would they not apply themselves accurately to the felt , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would injure the texture . On the contrary , the leaves fit themselves evenly to the side with a short nap , which absorbs the surplus water and gives a sufficient consistency for the coucher . It is also from this side that the layman detaches the sheets after the post has passed through the press so that the different character of these surfaces is an assistance to the layman as well as to the coucher . The material of which the felting is made requires great care on the part of the papermakers , and much attention and knowledge of the art of papermaking on the part of the manufacturer who prepares them . They should be firm enough to spread evenly upon the leaves without wrinkling or needing to be displaced . Also , they should be supple enough to adapt themselves to the work of the coucher , who applies the mould successively from one edge of the felt to the other upon every intermediate point . As the felts have to resist the reiterated efforts of the coucher and the press , it is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore made of combed and well-twisted wool . And as they should be clean and quickly absorb and give up again a certain  | amount of water , their weft should be of carded wool quite loosely spun and woven in about the same manner as light cloth . It results from this that the weft abundantly fills the stuff and covers the warp in such a way that the texture is not marked upon the paper , which would injure its grain by the irregular impression of an uncovered warp and weft , as is often observed in establishments where felts not woven upon these principles are used , which does not denote a great deal of talent upon the part of the papermaker . If the material were too closely woven , like ordinary cloths , or even the finest kinds , it would not absorb the water enough to enable the sheets to adhere and assume a certain consistency . It is for this reason that Carcassonne cloths are very well adapted to this purpose , and that those of Louviers , of which the texture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couched upon them in experiments several times repeated , because the water could not sufficiently  | penetrate them . It is very essential that the warp of the stuff intended to be made into felts should be strong and tough , so that they may be of good service and wear well . For pressing the water from the piles of paper and felts a wooden screw press such as was portrayed by Jost Amman in 1568 and Georg Andrea Buckler in 1662 was employed in the old mills ( Figures 136 , 146 , 152 , 153 , 154 , 155 ) . As these presses had to yield an immense pressure , they were massive and cumbersome , and constituted one of the most expensive appliances of the old paper mills . After the post had been placed under the platen of the press , all of the workers in the various parts of the mill were summoned together by the ringing of a bell to exert their strength in turning down the screw of the press by means of a long wooden lever. * footnote * In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in pressing the posts in an early nineteenth-century paper mill in Kentucky is given , and it will be noted that the procedure is not unlike that practised in Europe . Stedman wrote : " It was my duty when Layboy to  | blow a horn and notify all the men in the mill to come to help press the post . The man that tended the rag engine was the first one to come and help pull the post under the press , on top of this post was placed a plank like the one the post laid on , and the space between the post of paper and the screw-press was filled up with press-blocks , ten inches square and three feet long . The screw was then placed upon it and screwed down with a short lever as tight as four men could press . Then a lever , or pole , sixteen to twenty feet long and six inches in diameter , as much as two men could lift , with this six men pressed the post till all the water that was in the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn from the press , then commenced my work as Layboy , to separate the sheets of paper from the felts . To my left hand the lay-stool to place the paper on ; on my right was the post of paper and felts . To separate the sheets of paper was a particular kind of work , the sheets being wet , hardly dry enough to bare their own weight , so easy to tear . To separate them I had to stand half-bent , all day , and when the day 's work was done my back would ache so that many a night I could not sleep . " Stedman 's diary is the most complete account of early American papermaking and it is especially interesting in its relation to Kentucky , where the first paper mill west of the Susquehanna River was established in 1793 , only sixty-five years after the original paper mill in New England was set in operation .  | As the platen of the press closed downward upon the felts and newly formed paper , an abundance of water was forced from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thickness to barely six inches . In later years a device called a " Samson " or " sampson " was brought into use in the larger mills ( Figure 156 ) . This device acted as a windlass , and with the power of six men the pressing was more efficient than had been previously possible , giving the paper a more compact texture . To ensure a uniform pressure on the pile of paper and felting the workmen placed thin bevelled boards around the top of the post , for without this precaution the centre would have received more pressure than the edges . The results of these apparently simple innovations are reflected in the old papers , and without a knowledge of the different methods of working it is not possible to determine the age or origin of antique papers . After pressing , the weight of the paper and felts from the loss of the water had been reduced tenfold , and the fibres of the sheets of paper had been so matted and felted together by the great pressure that the sheets were lifted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homogeneous piece of paper , although far from being entirely dry . The third workman in the process of old papermaking was known as the " layman , " and it was his duty to free each sheet of paper from the interleaving felts and to place the sheets in a neat and even pile , one upon another , on an inclined stool or bench ( Figures 157 , 158 , 159 ) . The felts were returned to the coucher to be used in making the following post . These pure wool cloths were expensive , and the old mills had but one set for each size of paper that they made . By long hours and diligent work it was possible for the three workmen to make twenty posts , or about five and one half reams of paper , a day . Had but a single mould been used , one man acting as both vatman and coucher , scarcely one fourth of this amount would have been made . After the sheets had been placed directly one upon another by the layman , the pile was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure was light , brought out a little more water , which formed in drops upon the edges of the sheets . After this second pressing the sheets of paper were separated , again built into a pile , but in a different rotation , and subjected to a little  | heavier pressure than could have been given before , owing to the tendency of the sheets to stick together . This rearrangement of the sheets was repeated until the paper acquired the desired smoothness of finish . The roughness of much of this paper previous to the sixteenth century would indicate that before that time this exchanging or parting was not in practice in some localities , the paper evidently having received no finishing after removal from the woollen felts . In an examination of old paper , especially Italian and Dutch , it will be noticed that many of the sheets retain the impressions left by the material upon which they were couched . The early American papermakers did not devote much time or labour to the exchanging , although this procedure was , and still is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture . The next process was the drying of the paper , which was one of the most particular operations of the mill . The paper was taken from the pile , after the last pressing , in " spurs " of four or five sheets , as in this moist state they adhered together . Had the sheets been dried separately they would have wrinkled , but when taken in spurs the paper dried smoothly and without excessive curling . The drying-lofts of the old paper mills were situated in the top storeys of the buildings , where the air was reasonably free from  | particles of dirt and soot . The walls of these lofts were fitted with sliding wooden shutters which could be shifted to let in or exclude the air . The spurs of paper were hung over ropes that had been woven from cow- or horse-hair , coated with beeswax . These heavy ropes , supported by horizontal wooden frames called " tribbles " or " trebles , " ' were stretched throughout the loft , and the entrance of the air was arranged so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets and not against the edges of the paper . Ropes are still used in European mills for drying handmade paper , but the paper mills of America in the days of loft drying employed round or half-round wooden poles for this purpose . In the fifteenth- and sixteenth-century mills the drying was carried on in the most primitive manner , and it is not unusual in paper from this period to find stains through the middle of the sheets caused by the hair ropes upon which they had been hung to dry ( Figures 160 , 161 ) . During the development of papermaking in America some of the mills transported their paper to the printers before it had dried thoroughly , as the makers were not able to supply the demand with sufficient rapidity . In many folio volumes , particularly from the seventeenth century , the pages bulged in the centres , causing the leaves to lie in ridges , somewhat in the shape of a diamond . While this defect is more noticeable in folios , it may be found in smaller books also . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently . During the drying the weight of the paper stretched the sheets , causing them to bulge in the centres . The Oriental papers were dried in various ways : upon the moulds on which they had been formed ( Figures 42 , 43 , 46 , 172 ) ; or spread flat against boards ( Figures 162 , 163 , 164 , 166 , 177 ) ; or brushed against smooth masonry walls in the sun ( Figures 167 , 168 , 170 ) ; also , upon ropes or poles ( Figures 169 , 178 ) , and spread upon the ground ( as shown in Figures 165 and 171 ) . In drying paper against plaster walls the sheets were held rigid and flat , so that many of the Oriental papers are unusually smooth , especially on one side . footnote * The wooden " trebles " were pierced with holes at evenly spaced intervals for the support of the hair ropes , which were known as " treble-lines . " The word " treble " may have come originally from the ropes having been formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise origin of the word remains obscure .  | The drying completed , the old European papermakers dipped their paper into an animal size that had been made from the parings of hides , which they procured from the parchment-makers . It was necessary to size the paper so that it would be impervious to ink , but sizing was more needed in writing than in printing papers . Many books of the fifteenth century were printed upon paper that had not been sized , this extra treatment not being essential for a type impression . The sizing was accomplished by a worker holding a number of sheets with the aid of two wooden sticks and dipping the paper into the warm glutinous liquid . The sheets were then pressed to extract the superfluous gelatine . This crude method of sizing the paper was extremely wasteful , as many sheets were torn and bruised beyond use . The sizing room of the early Occidental paper mills was for this reason known as the " slaughter house . " One of the earliest Oriental methods of sizing paper consisted in covering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next improvement was to render the body of the paper , as well as the surface , impermeable to ink by the use of lichen , starch , or rice flour ( Figure 173 ) . The Chinese used starch as a size for paper as early as A.D. 768 . In an examination of more than a hundred different volumes of incunabula ( books printed in Europe before 1501 ) I have found that the papermakers of the fifteenth century followed no definite formula as to the sizing of their papers ; many of the sheets are heavily sized , others contain a limited amount of sizing , and a small number no sizing at all . Most of the modern European handmade papers , like some papers used in the early centuries of printing , are sized too densely and give the printer who employs the old traditional hand press no end of difficulty in his work . The earliest European book to mention the actual sizing of paper is the small volume entitled Papyrus sine Ars con ficiendx Papyri , compiled by J. Imberdis , Claromonti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatise on the art of papermaking to be published in France . Father Imberdis was a Jesuit , and being a native of Ambert in Auvergne , he was familiar with the paper mills of that district , a very old seat of French papermaking ; some historians contend that the first paper mills of France were set up in Auvergne . Judging from his detailed account of papermaking , Father Imberdis must have possessed a most observant and inquisi-  | tive mind . The entire treatise is in the nature of a descriptive poem giving a semi-technical version of papermaking as it was then practised in France . He states , with keen insight and knowledge uncommon in the layman , that the sheets of paper are far from perfect when they leave the mould , for even after being formed thereon the paper must pass through numerous hands and be subjected to a thousand manipulations before it is ready to leave the mill . No one but a maker of handmade paper can truly appreciate the significance of this statement . The author of the poem gives two methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to crumple the paper in the hands ; if the sound resembles that of parcn , nent under the same treatment the paper should prove satisfactory , as this shows it is well sized with animal glue . The second test is to wet the paper with the tongue ; if the saliva penetrates through the sheet , showing that there is little or no sizing , the paper is unfit for the application of fluid writing ink . In men-  | tioning the many difficulties and hardships of the papermakers ' craft Father Imberdis has this to say : " Heaven does not permit such a divine art to be made easy for mortals here below . " After the sizing operation was completed , the paper was again dried and taken to a room called the " saul " or " salle . " In England the finishing room of a paper mill has been known by this name for several hundred years . The term may have come originally from the German word Saal , and it is reasonable to surmise that it was first used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill in Kent in 1588 . The " salle " was that part of the mill where the paper was surfaced and packed for transportation . The earliest method of producing a smooth surface on the paper was to burnish each sheet by hand by the use of an agate or other glossy stone ( Figures 174 , 175 , 176 ) . The Orientals gave their paper a glass-like surface by this procedure . One side of the sheet only was burnished , but as the reverse side was laid against a smooth slab of wood it also took on a certain amount of finish . Even when the Asiatic scribes made use of European paper , they subjected it to a polishing with an agate or stone burnisher , which gave the paper an Oriental appearance . This action also closed the pores of the sheets and rendered them more suited for writing upon with ink . A mechanical method of imparting a surface to paper was brought into use in Europe in the early seventeenth  | century . This consisted of a pressing-hammer of huge construction , operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apparatus was borrowed by the papermakers from the bookbinders , as these craftsmen had employed this mechanism for polishing the backs of books for many years before the papermakers adopted it . This machine gave the paper a more uniform surface than had been possible by the hand rubbing method . The results achieved by the use of the glazing-hammer were soon spread to the different mills by travelling workers , and it was not long before this machine was used universally . The hand burnishers looked upon the introduction of the hammer none too kindly , for when it came into use they had to seek other employment . In Germany the intro-  | duction of the glazing-hammer about the year 1540 caused a division among the makers of paper . The mills that continued the use of the old hand burnishers would not allow , under severe punishment , any artisan to work for them who had been employed in a mill where the new mechanical device was used . The con-  | troversy became so heated that the government threatened to confiscate the tools used in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing- or glazing-hammers . In spite of this ruling , however , the mill-owners continued to polish or finish their paper in the manner they desired . Polishing by hand always gave the paper a streaked and uneven appearance owing to the narrowness of the glazing-stone , while the huge hammers imparted an almost uniform surface over the entire sheet . In old Oriental and Occidental papers these slight variations are traceable and afford somewhat of a clue as to the origin of the paper . About 1720 the pressing-hammers gave way to wooden glazing-rolls for giving the paper a smooth surface . These were a Dutch invention and consisted of two large rollers , * cut from the solid trunk of a tree , between which the paper was pressed . The finish which this machine imparted was as superior to that of the pressing-hammer as that had been to the original hand burnishing by stone . After the paper was finished it was packed for transportation by wrapping in heavy coarse paper of a brown or grey colour ; this wrapping paper was made from the dregs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book or writing paper . While there are no paper-package labels from the fifteenth century extant , there have been a good many preserved from later centuries ( Figures 180 , 181 , 182 , 183 ) . The methods used at present in making handmade paper differ but little from those described . Several improvements in the construction of the vats have been made , the chief of which was the " knotter , " which eliminated foreign substances and knotted fibres from the paper stock before it ran into the vat . This appliance , an American invention , f came into general use about 1819 ; before footnote * The earliest United States patent in the Paper Museum covering the glazing-roll , or plater , is dated February 27 , 1827 , and was issued to Ira White and Leonard Gale of Newbury , Orange County , Vermont .

The heavy wooden screw press may still be seen in several of the older handmadepaper mills in Europe , but the hydrostatic press is now used by all well-equipped vat mills . This was invented in 1790 , but was not adopted until long after that date , although Joseph Bramah , the originator , recommended it for use in paper mills .

To be able to determine the locality and period of old papers it is necessary to make a minute study of the ancient papermaking appliances , as the succession of innovations , occurring in different countries at various periods , caused changes in the character of paper throughout the ages . To the casual observer these changes are insignificant , but to the student of papermaking they are clues that , followed , lead to secrets of the craft he loves . the old screw press and one can limit the pressure as desired by simply turning a tap ; the press is disengaged in an instant .

In investigating handmade paper fabrication in China the wayfarer will at once be interested in the use of paper in religious rites and sacrifices , as well as for many of the practical purposes for which it is employed . Also , in Japan and Korea great quantities of paper are used in ways totally unknown in the Occident . In this chapter , therefore , an account of the development and use of Chinese ceremonial paper , and an outline of the present-day uses of paper in Japan and Korea for utilitarian purposes , will be undertaken . Before the advent of paper , or as early as the period of the Western or Former Han Dynasty ( 206 B.C.-A.D. 25 ) , wealthy Chinese placed silver and copper coins in the tombs and coffins of their deceased relatives , so that the departed might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . The authenticity of this statement rests upon the assertion in the Chronicles of the Former Han ' that during the reign of Emperor Wu Ti ( 140 ? 86 B.c. ) vandals entered the vault of one of his ancestors , Wen Ti , ( 179 ? 156 B.C. ) and made away with the silver coins therein . After the invention of paper by Ts'ai Lun , while Emperor Ho Ti ( A.D. 89 ? 106 ) ruled the country , we are informed by the Chronicles of the Later Han 2 that paper was placed in the tombs as a substitute for the metal coins of earlier years . During the dynasties of Wei and Chin , from the beginning of the Three Kingdoms ( A.D. 221 ? 420 ) , it is recorded that " cunning knaves " cut paper into forms and offered it to the spirits in lieu of genuine silver and copper coins .  | According to the numismatical work entitled Ch'uan-pu t'ungchih , 3 published in China in 1833 , the first paper notes issued in the Celestial Empire made their appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 683 ) , of the T'ang Dynasty . By the fourteenth century paper money was fairly common in China . Most of the notes of the Ming Dynasty are dark grey in colour , * owing to the use of both the dark outer bark and the white inner bark of the mulberry tree in their making . Legend has it that Emperor Wu ( A.D. 1368 ? 98 ) tried to procure a suitable paper for the printing of money and to this end consulted with the wise men of his realm for advice . One of the learned group suggested that counterfeiting could only be prevented by mixing the macerated hearts of great literary men with the mulberry-bark pulp . The Emperor is said to have taken this suggestion under advisement , but at length he decided it would be a grave mistake to destroy the literary men of China simply for the purpose of using their hearts as ingredients for paper . In talking over the problem with the Empress she suggested that the same result could be achieved without interfering with the lives of their scholarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart of any true literary man was actually in his writings . Therefore , the wise Empress asked the Emperor to have collected the papers upon which the great Chinese authors and poets had set down their writings . The manuscripts were duly macerated and added to the mulberry bark and it was thought that the dark grey footnote * Many of the early Chinese papers have a slightly yellow tone , due , no doubt , to direct dyeing rather than to the natural colour of the papermaking fibre . The colouring matter was probably used more as an insecticide than from any desire to beautify the paper by changing its tone . This slightly poisonous matter , known in China as huang-neih or huang-po ( ) , was taken from the seeds of the Phellodendron amurense , commonly known as the Amoor cork tree . As early as A.D. 674 a Chinese edict specified that all papers to be used for certain types of documents and religious records must be treated in this manner . There are numerous references in Chinese literature to the use of this yellow substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that manuscripts so treated have a toxic effect and would repel the ravages of insects . The colouring matter was probably added to the paper , by either dipping or brushing , after the paper had been finished . It is thought that dyeing the pulp in the vat before it was formed into paper was a later development , perhaps conceived by the Koreans at least several hundred years after the Chinese edict of the seventh century .  | tone of the money papers was due to the black ink used in the calligraphy upon the paper . After the issuance of the first paper money it no doubt became the custom to make imitations , but not counterfeits , of these notes for burial with the dead . During the period of K'ai Yuan ( A.D. 713 ? 739 ) , T'ang Than Tsung , a most superstitious person , established Wang Yu as High Master of Ceremonies . This minister began the burning of mock paper money at the Imperial sacrifices , and he himself had great faith in the practice . According to the Chronicles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by numerous Chinese scholars , who were apprehensive that the rite might become popular with the rank and file of the people ; but in spite of the severe condemnation of the learned gentlemen the custom soon became prevalent among all classes and in all parts of the vast country . To the present day the rite is practised in every city and hamlet of China , as well as in all Asiatic countries where the Chinese have immigrated . There was , indeed , sound argument in favour of the imitation paper money . The practice of burying the actual silver and copper coins with the dead not only made the tombs a prey for robbers , but removed an immense amount of money from circulation , a serious matter in a land where metals were scarce . For these two reasons , no doubt , the use of genuine coins was abandoned , and in their place pieces of paper made to resemble somewhat the newly introduced paper notes were substituted . The tomb papers ( Figures 184 , 185 ) were not in any way a direct copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been punishable by decapitation . The disillusioned scholars who condemned the rite were too few to prevail against the hundreds of thousands who sanctioned and approved the ghostly practice , but their unceasing protests , and the protests of others who followed them , are recorded in old Chinese histories . Among the men who thus protested was an official named Wang Ssu Tsung , who lived during the reign of Chen Tsung ( A.D. 998 ? 1023 ) , of the Sung Dynasty . This gentleman , who occupied the position of Prefect of the Second Order , forbade all unorthodox sacrifices and caused many of the temples of the false gods to be destroyed . On his deathbed Wang Ssu Tsung was distressed when his family burned offerings to procure his content-  | ment in the next world , and , according to the ancient records , " raised his feeble voice and cried : If the spirits are intelligent , how can they accept bribes ? ' " In the reign of Hui Tsung ( A.D. 1101 ? 26 ) , of the Sung Dynasty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chung , who presented a petition to abolish the burning of ceremonial papers . The petition read : " The custom of burning perforated paper made to resemble money , so as to assure happiness in the spirit world , is an absurd delusion ; if the spirits have intelligence the practice is an insult to them . " It is likely that the sheets of perforated paper , made in the shape of round coins pierced with square holes for stringing , was the original " spirit-money , " inasmuch as metal coins preceded paper notes by many centuries . With all the apparent disbelief in the rite by the scholarly gentry , the funeral of Emperor Kao Tsung ( A.D. 1127 ? 63 ) was a most elaborate show of the burning of ceremonial papers and mock money and of all manner of paper images set afire before his remains . The heir-apparent , Hsiao Tsung ( A.D. 1163-1290 ) , however , was contemptuous of the practice and re-  | buked the officials at the ceremony by saying : " The burning of spirit-money is a Buddhist practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs no such things . " These few instances of approval and disapproval will serve to show that in early times , as at present , there was much agitation relative to the use of paper for sacrificial offerings , and that all through the centuries there has been a never ceasing controversy as to whether or not the old rite should be continued . Marco Polo ( 1254-1323 ) , during his researches in China , was amazed at the use of great quantities of paper in native ceremonies and in his writings we find many references to this dominating practice , a use for paper entirely unknown in Europe . ( It is of interest to note that the Chinese were the first to use toilet paper , for in a book published in France in 1718 it is recorded that Arabs travelling in China in the ninth century were confronted with such paper . The book giving this information is Eusebius Renaudot 's Anciennes Relations des Indes et de la Chine de deux voyageurs Mohametans.5 The passage relating to toilet paper appears on page 17 and reads as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro prete et ils ne se lavent pas avec de l'eau , quand ils ont este a leurs necessitez ; mais ils s'essuyent seulement avec du papier . " ) The use of ornamental paper cut to represent various objects and burned at Chinese funerals long antedates the time of Marco Polo and has continued through the centuries to this day ; every year thousands of reams of paper are consumed by fire in ceremonial offerings . Objects of all kinds are constructed of paper and burned at the bier of the deceased so the departing spirit may have an abundance of the things represented by the frail paper effigies . Along certain streets in all the great cities of China , as well as in all large communities of Asia where Chinese people dwell , there may be seen open shops , usually clustered three or four together , where these ghost-like paper replicas are fashioned ? highly ornate cardboard chests with shiny gold and silver paper locks , flowing robes of paper painted with golden dragons and complicated patterns , shoes , hats , and all manner of wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relatives of the wealthy the craftsmen in paper also construct full-sized carts , horses , and even automobiles , the thought being that when these fragile representations  | go up in smoke they will eventually assume reality in heaven and the deceased will have horses and vehicles at his disposal . I have often marvelled at the skill and patience of these artisans who fashion the paper objects , as they work in their open-fronted shops along the narrow , dirty streets and courts . The facade of each shop is usually decorated with a number of gaily painted mirrors , and the interior takes on the appearance of a veritable paper museum , all kinds of funeral paraphernalia made of paper hanging from the rafters , and shelves , drawers , and cases literally overflowing with every conceivable variety of decorated and coloured paper used in the making of these weird reproductions . Quality and workmanship vary to suit both the rich and the lowly , but all alike are destined to be burned at funerals . In Bangkok , where the population is largely Chinese , I recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of the effigy of a huge dog , the frame made of thin strips of bamboo , all covered with many thicknesses of paper and finally realistically painted with water colours . Upon asking the Chinese worker for what purpose the paper dog was intended , I was told that a wealthy Chinese merchant had just died and that this was a representation of his mastiff ; the imitation animal had been ordered by the dead man 's relatives and would be burned at his funeral to assure his master of having his favourite dog with him when he reached the spirit world . Everywhere such paper animals , paper clothing , and vehicles go up in smoke at Chinese funeral ceremonies , yet the number of these objects is insignificant compared with the quantities of mock money burned every year in China and all over Asia where Chinese have made their homes . It is probably reasoned by many Chinese that if sufficient " money " is burned the deceased relative or friend will be able to purchase elaborate clothing , fine horses , and other necessities and luxuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn paper images made in imitation of these things for the departed to enjoy them . In many Chinese homes the paper is burned before the coffin of the deceased , consumed upon a stone hearth in the living-quarters . It goes without saying that numerous disastrous fires have been caused by over-zealous indulgence in burning paper images and imitation paper money . The following dispatch to American newspapers from Taiyuan , China , dated June 17 , 1936 , is signifi-  | cant : " The performance of an ancient Chinese ritual of mourning today cost the life of the widow and son of a general one week after he had been assassinated . Buddhist monks were burning in effigy the household utensils and money of General Li Sheng-ta in front of his coffin . The flames were carried by a draught to other paper images that were near the casket in honour of the dead . A roaring fire developed in a few seconds . The widow and son rushed in to save the corpse from the burning paper replicas and both were fatally burned . " Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I especially recall the occasion when I was invited to attend the funeral of a relative of an old scholarly gentleman who asked me to meet him at a certain road-crossing so that he might guide me to the house of death . He appeared promptly at the hour agreed upon , dressed in long silk robes and padded slippers , and mounted in state upon a nickel-plated bicycle , the handle-bars of which were laden with mock money and paper images ? an anachronism that afforded me much secret amusement . In the large centres the ordinary ceremonial papers , put up in compact packages , are usually sold in special shops dealing in joss paper , candles , incense sticks , and other items used in sacrificial offerings . In the villages and outlying country districts the more common funeral papers may be had in almost any shop where groceries are sold , the bundles of paper being invariably stored on the upper shelves of the orderly stores , pungent with the aroma of spices , roots , ginger , nuts , and herbs . I have procured these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as in muddy country hamlets ; in the moist , mouldy shops of Indo-China , in the stores of the Chinese section of old Manila , in the small sidewalk shops of the villages of Java and Sumatra , in the queer Chinese markets of Kuala Lumpur , Penang , Singapore , and other settlements of Malaysia , and in the paper-shops of Bangkok 's crooked lanes and winding canals ( Figure 187 ) . In the Chinese quarter of New York I have gone from store to store and from shopkeeper to shopkeeper seeking the small bales of " spirit-paper , " but I have found that most of the Chinese living in America know nothing of its use . In one cramped establishment , kept by a parchment-faced Chinese , I found a small assortment of the less pretentious ceremonial papers , along with the bamboo paper trays in which they  | are sometimes placed , fan-like , for burning . I was informed that the custom of consigning imitation money to the flames is seldom preserved by the Chinese after leaving Asia , and that paper is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who insist upon following the ancient traditional rites of the homeland ( Figure 188 ) . China is a vast country , the topography of which makes intercourse between districts exceedingly difficult . It is therefore a land of many dialects and of many provinces , the comparative isolation of which tends to preserve ancient local customs and ceremonies . It has been my experience that even the educated Chinese of North China are entirely unfamiliar with the customs and pracflces of their countrymen living in the south ; also that the people  | from the coastal provinces know very little regarding the ceremonial customs of inner China . The religious ceremonies of various isolated districts do not arise entirely from Confucianism , nor are they wholly Buddhistic or Taoistic ; they are largely of local origin and exhibit different practices even in adjacent provinces . The one thing common to all Chinese ceremonies , especially funerals , is the desire of the relatives of the deceased to outdistance in display anything that has been attempted previously in their particular neighbourhood . This is attended by complications , the rivalry often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spending five or even ten times as much money for a funeral as they actually possess . The Chinese people are noted for their love of gambling , but their desire for elaborate and costly funerals occupies almost as large a place in their hearts as their various games of chance . It is evident that paper plays a prominent part in myriad Chinese ceremonies . ' The fibrous substance called paper is regarded in a vastly different light in the Orient from what it is in the Occident , for in the Far East it has a spiritual significance that overshadows its practical use , while in the Western world the purposes  | for which paper is intended are purely practical and utilitarian . In dealing with the use of ceremonial paper in China , therefore , it is essential to realize the respect and reverence that this substance commands in the Celestial Empire and to endeavour , if possible , to attain an appreciation of the Chinese viewpoint relative to paper ? a viewpoint that has been inherited by the Chinese through hundreds of years of paper symbolism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the paper used in China for ceremonial purposes is manufactured by hand in Chekiang . In the statistics compiled in 1935 by the Minister of Industry , Nanking , ' the number of individual handmade-paper mills in Chekiang Province in 1933 was 24,437 . These small , family mills , termed tsao hu , are found principally in Fuyang , Yiihang , and Yungchia , with Ch'iihsien , T'unglu , Chuchi , Hsinteng , and Hsiaoshan of lesser importance . The capital involved in the handmade-paper industry of Chekiang Province in 1933 amounted to about five million Shanghai dollars , half of this money being invested in Fuyang . The establishments where the finished paper is sold are known as chih hong or chih po chuang , the most important centre for selling the sacrificial papers being the city of Hangchow . In Chekiang there are almost 127,000 workers engaged in making handmade paper , the artisans  | varying in number in each small cottage mill according to the kind of paper fabricated . Where bamboo is used as raw material the number of workers varies from four to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bark of trees , or ts'ao paper from ricestraw , only three men are needed ( Figures 190 , 191 ) . In Fuyang alone there are over 40,000 papermakers at work in some ten thousand individual mills . The annual production of handmade paper in Chekiang Province in 1933 was valued at more than twenty million dollars . The paper made from bamboo represents about three fourths of the total production , the bamboos used being classified as ch'ing kao , pai liao , and huang liao . In making paper from bamboo , straw , and the bark of trees it is necessary to use a different method of preparation for each material , but the actual process of forming the fibre into sheets of paper is practically identical . In using bamboo the canes are stripped of their leaves and shoots , tied into bundles , and steeped in a pond until the green outer skin , or bark , can be removed . After splitting , the bamboos are placed in layers in a sunken pit  | lined with stones , layers of canes alternating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit is then filled with water and the bamboo allowed to soak thoroughly for several months . After this intense treatment in the lime solution the bamboo is taken from the pit and placed in clear water to free the material from any trace of the caustic . After a vigorous cleansing the semi-disintegrated bamboo is beaten by hand , or by water- or buffalo-power . This final process renders the fibre suitable for forming into sheets of paper by the use of the hand-mould . In preparing the bark for making the superior pi paper , the branches of the trees are cut during the winter months , tied into bundles , and finally given a steaming in an iron cauldron for two or three hours . After this preliminary treatment the branches are removed from the cauldron and the outer bark stripped from the stalks ; the bark is then dried in the sun . A second boiling in lime reduces the bark to a semi-macerated condition , after which it is bleached ? a process that requires from seven to eleven weeks . The bleached bark is finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it becomes a fibrous pulp . Before this pulp can be moulded into paper a mucilaginous gum made from the leaves of deciduous trees is added to the substance . The Chinese paper termed ts'ao is of a yellow colour and is made from rice-straw . The process of reducing this material to a pulp is much simpler than that used for either bamboo or tree barks . The straw first receives a preliminary pounding and then after saturation in a lime solution is buried in a trench . When properly disintegrated , the straw is removed and placed in porous cloth bags , which in turn are suspended in a running stream so that the fibres may be cleansed of all particles of lime . The straw fibre , being of a tender nature , requires far less beating than either bamboo or bark . The forming of the sheets of paper upon moulds is practically the same with each of the three distinct types of fibres . From this account of the use of paper in China for ceremonial purposes it must not be surmised that the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual requirements of native bookprinting , the papers of China are used extensively in the lining of clothing and in the making of sandals and slippers ; also in the fabrication of toys , firecrackers , and fireworks , so much in evi-  | dence in all parts of China at festival time . Throughout China paper is always in evidence for many unusual purposes , and for the most part it is manufactured by hand from bamboo , straw , or mulberry bark or a mixture of these fibres . JAPAN In travelling through the more remote papermaking districts of Japan on the narrow , rough , and often dangerous roads , passing endless processions of carts , jinrikishas , and pedestrians along almost continuous lanes of low-built villages , the Occidental traveller can not but observe two dominant features ? the absence of chimneys on the houses and shops , and the use of great quantities of handmade paper for everyday purposes . The rooms of Japanese houses are heated by large , heavy earthenware bowls , known as hibachi , in each of which several pieces of charcoal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or asbestos , the charcoal being dextrously put in place by the use of ornamental brass chopsticks . To the visitor from the Occident , accustomed to central heating supplemented by roaring wood fires within huge chimneys , the Japanese method of heating seems cheerless and inadequate , but in the elimination of complicated heating devices and chimneys the Nipponese have dispensed with one of the most expensive features of house construction . It is doubtful , however , if the native people of Japan , huddled about the small charcoal fires , are ever wholly warm during the cold , damp winter months , as they are constantly rubbing their hands above the hibachi in an effort to absorb what little heat may arise . The living-quarters of Japanese houses are fairly large , and usually one or two outside walls of each room are fitted with small oblong frames of frail wood over which paper is pasted , allowing the entrance of some light but preventing all vision from either the inside or the outside ( Figure 193 ) . Even in the north country the Japanese houses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meagre indoor comfort afforded by their charcoal heaters from the drifted snowbanks and cold winds from the mountains . * ? From a scientific standpoint it has lately been proved that the use of paper in windows is more healthful than the use of glass . The paper permits the beneficial ultraviolet rays of the sun to penetrate into the room , while glass excludes these rays . Also , paper is a warm substance , as is evidenced in the use of paper in keeping the body warm ; glass is extremely cold .  | While Oriental houses with their fragile , although fairly practical , paper windows would not be adequate in material comfort for us , we of the Occident could doubtless learn much in economy from the Chinese and Japanese of the use of paper in ways unknown in the Western world . For instance , the burden of windowwashing is eliminated with the use of paper windows , as each spring the old soiled paper is removed and fresh paper pasted to the wooden window frames . Oriental artisans have developed a wide variety of papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development in Japan is largely due to the growth of certain trees and shrubs , the bark of which , when unadulterated with European wood pulps , forms excellent papermaking fibre . With the Japanese innate ability to execute hand work and through the use of the mulberry ( Broussonetia papyri f era ) , mitsumata ( Edgeworthia papyri f era ) , and gampi ( Wikstrcemia canescens ) fibres as raw materials , the handmade papers of Japan fabricated previous to the modern tendency to haste and cheapening were admirably adapted to many Occidental aesthetic and industrial uses . In late years , however , the Japanese have lessened the quality , and thereby the desirability , of their papers by the admixture of inferior foreign wood pulps . Also , they have reduced the quality of their handmade papers by the employment of mechanical drying devices and supplementing honest hand work with the introduction of power-driven beaters and other appliances for the acceleration of the process . In Europe and America , as well as in the Orient , there are fastrunning machines producing paper in continuous rolls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily torn , mechanically-made papers would not endure the ordeal to which the old Japanese handmade papers were subjected in the making of windows , lanterns , partition screens , umbrellas , rain-cloaks , bags , and tarpaulins , and for all sorts of other requirements where glass , metal , leather , rubber , and cloth are employed in the Occident . The general impression existing among Western people is that Japan has a mild climate , and therefore more delicate and fragile objects can survive . But this is not the case ; both summer and winter in Japan are most severe and are trying even to an American accustomed to rigorous winters and to summers that are damp and-warm . In preindustrialized Japan it was only through the use  | of superior and unique papermaking materials and genuine ability in the craft of paper fabrication that the Japanese were able to make papers that gave faithful service through long periods , being used over and over again . In former times it was not uncommon to see paper umbrellas that had been in use many years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainless country . The observant wayfarer who has sojourned in the mountainous little islands during the spring months is cognizant of the hardships the paper umbrellas had to endure , for in Japan it often rains for several days without interruption ; yet no matter how wet and dank it may have been , the peasants were always to be seen walking through the rain-soaked rice fields with their stilted wooden sandals and their charmingly coloured umbrellas . Along the country roads of Japan it was always interesting to watch the great variety of man- and beast-drawn carts laden with every kind of native commodity , each cart with its paper tarpaulin . Every little vehicle had this oiled-paper protection , impervious to water and lighter in weight and cheaper than cloth , which during sunny weather was folded and packed away in the cart . These seemingly frail paper coverings endured the trying conditions to which they were subjected from one year to another and finally wore out only through constant use , like any other supposedly more durable material . The jinrikisha men in the towns and villages during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this covering not only was effective in keeping them dry , but could be purchased in large pieces for a few sen . The workers in the fields , the men labouring on the roads , and the watchmen at the railway crossings depended upon coverings of paper to keep them dry . The oiled paper of Japan could formerly be purchased in the smallest of shops , and every peasant cottage had a stock of sheets of divers sizes , which were used again and again for many household requirements . In the tea-growing districts stout oiled-paper bags were used for holding the newly picked leaves and it was not unusual to see paper sacks that had given service for half a dozen years literally covered with patches of paper where they had been repaired from time to time . Paper bags for the storing of grain were also common , for paper that had been oiled or tanned with the fermented juice of green persimmons , the method used to ren-  | der the material durable , was not easily destroyed by insects . The Occidental traveller never ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese for utilitarian purposes . The Japanese have been making handmade paper for more than thirteen centuries , and through the ages its myriad applications to local needs have been almost without limit . The most unusual and fantastic use of the paper , however , occurred during the late war when the Japanese military undertook to dispatch bomb-laden paper balloons to the shores of the United States with the hope of inflicting death and destruction and causing untold consternation . The paper used in making these balloons , of remarkable tensile strength , was made of long , drawn-out mulberry fibre , and to render the material impervious to water it was treated in the manner long used by the Japanese in waterproofing their paper umbrellas , bags , tarpaulins , and many other useful commodities used outdoors . Specimens of the balloon paper show many small paper patches , resembling the repaired paper bags that are used from one year to another by the tea-growers of Shizuoka . It is probable that the paper used in constructing the balloons was made in a number of different isolated mills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper and the technique employed in its formation . In the state of Montana balloons of a brown-yellow colour as well as of an almost pure white tone were found , while in Oregon paper balloons of a pleasing light-blue shade were discovered . The paper balloons were responsible for the deaths of several persons and perhaps they were instrumental in causing a few small forest fires , but considering the magnitude of the effort the military results obtained by the Japanese were infinitesimal . After the Japanese surrender the Staff Officers Technical Section , Japanese Headquarters , Tokyo , revealed that they worked for two years in an attempt to perfect the paper balloons and 9,000,000 yen ( more than $2,000,000 ) was expended on the project . Each balloon was about forty feet in diameter and all together , according to the Japanese , nine thousand of the bomb-laden balloons were launched from three different sites near Tokyo . Japanese scientists had the course of the sky-weapons computed in detail : each balloon would spiral upward more than ten thousand yards , they estimated , then eastward winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 190 miles an hour in a straight course for the United States . Timing devices were set to explode the bombs from forty to fifty hours after the balloons had been launched . While an undetermined number of the balloons did land in the United States , one as far east as Michigan , details of the outcome of the dubious experiment were kept secret in this country so the Japanese were uncertain and bewildered as to the effect the sinister paper balloons were having on their Occidental enemy . Before the close of the war the Japanese came to the conclusion that most of the balloons were going down in the Pacific Ocean , and by April 20 , 1945 the entire project , which had employed thousands of women papermakers , was abandoned as a complete failure . KOREA While Korea for years has been dominated by Japan , this peninsula country has not been modernized to the same extent as Japan ; Korea still retains many of its age-old customs and traditions . In Korean houses paper plays a part that is unique , for in place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese houses , the Koreans use thick oiled paper , a thoroughly practical material when their method of heating is considered . In Korea the rooms are kept warm , not by the picturesque but impractical hibachi of Japan , but by an oven under the floor . The smoke is emitted by way of a tile chimney running underground and finally rising within a brick wall at a considerable distance from the house ; though in lowly homes the smoke escapes directly from the house foundation without the expense or bother of a tile chimney . For actual comfort the Korean house is preferable to the old-time Japanese house . In both countries the people live close to the floor , and in Korea the floors are delightfully warm ; while in Japan , even though covered with the thick straw mats , the floors are usually cold and uncomfortable . In Korea , as in Japan and in some parts of China , paper is used for windows ( Figure 194 ) . A census of the handmade paper industry of Japan would show between twelve and fifteen hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In China and Japan papermaking by  | hand is by no means an obsolete industry , and new uses for paper are constantly being developed . It is possible that the fabrication of paper by hand will continue for all time in the Orient , as labour costs are comparatively low and there is considerable natural papermaking material . Coupled with these two important conditions is the fact that many of the utilitarian handmade papers of the East have desirable qualities that can not be duplicated successfully by the papermaking machine . In japan in the year 1932 ( the latest figures available ) the value of paper made by hand was 14,000,000 yen , while that manufactured by machinery was 43 , - 000,000 yen ? surely a comparison that is favourable to the ancient hand process when compared with conditions in Occidental countries . In three great papermaking districts of Japan ? Gifu , Fukui , Kochi ? there were in 1934 almost six thousand families who gained their support through the fabrication of handmade paper . The Japanese , however , have not been slow in adopting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paper made in Japan that can be formed successfully only by the use of a hand-mould in the hands of a skilled and patient craftsman . The papers of China , Japan , and Korea , used in the myriad ways that have been described , are for the most part made by the traditional hand methods . The chief fibres used for making Oriental papers , as previously outlined , are bamboo , rice-straw , mulberry , rnitsumata , and gampi barks . These materials grow and are used in China , Japan , and Indo-China . The material used in most of the handmade papers of Siam is the native khoi bark ( Streblus aaper ) ; in India jute ( Corchorus olitorius ) and hemp ( Crotalaria juncea ) and discarded papers ( naddi ) are largely used for papermaking . In Nepal the Daphne cannabina is the bark used in making the large sheets of paper used in this northern country , while in Burma and Tibet a species of the mulberry tree yields the papermaking fibre . In Europe and America handmade paper is regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the printing of expensive books , for etchings and elaborate stationery . Indeed , the greater part of the people of the Occident live their entire lives without ever even seeing any paper that has been formed by the hand method . In the more traditional Orient this condition does not exist . Every person , from peasant to plutocrat , comes in daily contact with common , useful things that have been made of handmade paper ? things fabricated by artisans who regard their craftsmanship as edified through its use by workaday people for humble purposes . The makers of handmade paper in the Orient , unlike those of the Occident , do not feel that their handiwork should be restricted only to the libraries and drawing-rooms of those who have the means to indulge in finely printed books and expensive engravings . Their art is not exclusive , but inclusive , an ideal which is the result of an ancient civilization where handmade paper has always been used for making lowly objects , and where traditions and training have been handed down through countless generations of papermaking families . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the Early Years of Printing THE PAPER fabricated in the fifteenth- and sixteenth-century mills did not vary in size to the same extent as paper made in later years , owing to the limited demand for sheets of diverse dimensions and to the expense of production . For every size of paper two moulds and one deckle ? were required , appliances fashioned only with diffculty and considerable outlay of money . In the early years of printing , the paper was seldom cut , the sheets being printed upon in the original sizes formed in the moulds , although in many cases the deckle edges were trimmed away . In all old paper , as well as in the handmade papers of the present day , there is a considerable variation in the thickness and finish , and in single books the leaves vary noticeably in weight . The tone of the old paper was never entirely uniform , and owing to the absence of chemicals in the manufacture , the grades of paper differed strikingly in colour . The best paper was of a creamy tint , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were a light coffee tone , and at times even a dark grey . The bleaching of linen and cotton rags for papermaking was not iii general use until the early nineteenth century , and all paper made before that time assumed the tone of the material from which it was made ; the water used in the early mills also had considerable influence upon the shade or tint of the paper . In the wintertime , especially , it was difficult to clarify the water for use in the paper footnote * The use of two moulds and one deckle applies only to the making of paper in the European manner where the vatman forms the sheets and the coucher lays them down . In all Asiatic papermaking based on the Oriental principle only one mould is required for each size of paper as the same worker acts as both vatman and coucher.  | mills . This muddy appearance is noticeable in many of the early American-made papers . It is interesting to note that in England very little paper except that of a coarse quality and greyish tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time papermaking was introduced into the American colonies . In France blueing was often added to the paper stock to counteract the discoloration caused by muddy water . In holding old paper to the light it is not uncommon to notice in the sheets round semi-transparent spots , somewhat smaller than a dime ( Figure 195 ) . These spots have a thinner surface than the rest of the sheet , resembling a watermark to some extent , and may be found in modern handmade paper as well as in the old . They were caused by drops of water falling from the workers ' hands upon the moist sheet just after it had been dipped ; the water  | spreading the wet fibres formed almost perfectly round indentations in the finished paper , discernible only when the sheet is held to the light . When these drops do appear in paper there are usually several of them , of various sizes , as a rule near the corners of the sheets . There are also in some of the old papers ruffled or blurred " chain-lines , " a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ( Figure 196 ) . This blurring of either the " chain " or " laid " wire impressions was caused by the coucher having allowed the mould to slip , with its thin deposit of pulp , just as he was in the act of couching the sheet upon the felting . Another defect , encountered only in old paper , is a peppered appearance throughout the sheet , due to the knotting of certain of the fibres ( Figure 197 ) . It would hardly be possible to examine thoroughly any fifteenth- or sixteenth-century book without finding all of these imperfections represented in the paper . It is not unusual to discover embedded in old papers hairs loosened from the felt in the pressing process ; or human hairs fallen from the head of the vatman or coucher . In the Paper Museum there is a piece of paper in which has been embedded a fifteenth-century mosquito , visible only when the sheet is held to the light . To pre-  | vent the intermingling of foreign substances with the paper pulp was a trying problem for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no end of trouble with stray particles which enter the beater , and , broken there into hundreds of minute pieces , find their way into the vat and cause unsightly specks in the sheets of paper .  | In examining early printed books it will be noticed that in many instances the deckle or rough edges ( Figure 198 ) have been cut away . In some cases this trimming was done before the paper was printed upon , as many of the old typographers no doubt regarded the deckle edges simply as necessary imperfections in the making of the paper . When the deckle edges were left undisturbed by the printer they often suffered at the hands of the binder , so it is more usual to find early volumes with cut edges than with the original deckles . The weapon with which the binder dealt the most deadly blows was the " plough , " with which he cut away the margins , placing the printing in a false position on the page of the book , and often denuding the volumes of a portion of the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an extent that a folio became a quarto , or a quarto an octavo , in size . Modern bibliographers usually catalogue these old volumes by measurement instead of by the paper . If a book was printed on a once-folded sheet , it would always be a folio , no matter how much a ruthless or ignorant binder may have cut it down . In the early printed books this trimming was possible as the margins were purposely left wide for the notes of the readers , so that a folio could have been reduced several inches without interfering with the text . The only way to arrive at the original size of an old volume is to examine the paper on which it was printed . In the paper-moulds the " chain-lines " invariably ran the short way of the sheet , and the " laid-lines " the long way , or from right to left as the mould was held in the hands of the vatman . In binding a folio volume the sheets were folded in the centre , the " chain-lines " running up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the margins have been trimmed off , it is always possible by this means to see that the volume was originally a folio . In a quarto the paper was again folded , so that the " chain-lines " ran across the page , from left to right . With an octavo the " chain-lines " ran up and down as in a folio . Before me is a book from the Aldine Press , dated 1522 , which was catalogued as an octavo , for its actual measurements ( 12 by 20 cm. ) would indicate this size . Originally , however , the volume was a quarto , as the " chain-lines " in the paper run across the pages . On the other hand , the edition of Artemus de Bello Gallico printed by Nicholas Jenson in Venice in 1471 is usually , because of its large size , set down by the cataloguers as a folio , but in this book  | the " chain-lines " run across the pages , so it must be a quarto . This test holds good for a great many books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon because it is a natural test and is applicable to all books of Occidental origin . The size of the largest paper used by William Caxton 1 was 15% by 22 inches . This paper was used for two books only : the first and second editions of the Golden Legend ( first edition finished at Westminster the 20th of November 1483 ; the second edition appearing soon after , but without date ; printed in double columns , containing 464 folios ) . This size was probably found too large for convenient printing , as for all of the other Caxton books smaller paper was used , varying in size from 11 by 16 to 13 by 1832 inches . The average size of moulds used for making paper in Europe during the fifteenth century was about 14 by 19 inches ; the largest sheets measured about 1832 by 26% inches . These were convenient sizes for the mould-makers to fabricate and also for the papermakers to form sheets upon ; the larger the moulds , the more difficult they were to handle , as their weight when laden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than would be imagined . In Great Britain even as late as 1818 it was ordained by law that no newspaper should exceed in dimensions 22 by 32 inches . " So desirous were the publishers of newspapers at that time for a larger surface , " wrote Charles Cowan 2 in his reminiscences of his early days in a handmade-paper mill at St. Mary Cray , Kent , " that an order for a large quantity of paper reached us , the size to be 2232 by 3232 inches , and the stationer stated that he would assume all risk of passing it through the Stamp Office . " This would have given a surface of 731 square inches to each sheet instead of the statutory maximum of 704 square inches . About the largest surface of the fifteenth-century papers was 470 square inches , while a surface of approximately 235 square inches was the most common . The largest size of handmade paper that is fabricated at present is made in the James Whatman , Springfield mill at Maidstone , Kent , the sheet being termed " antiquarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1,643 square inches.3 For making sheets of this giant size the mould is hung on a mechanical lifting device and six or eight men are required in the dipping and couching processes . It was at this renowned mill that the size of handmade paper known as " medium " ( 17% by 22 inches ) was first made two sheets on a  | mould , ' a deckle running through the mould dividing it into two equal parts so that two sheets could be dipped and couched with practically the same effort as had been previously expended in making one sheet ( Figures 199 , 200 ) . This was in 1826 , and the innovation caused a split among the makers belonging to " the Original Society " which lasted several years . The section of artisans who were adverse to making two sheets of medium paper simultaneously on a mould called themselves the " Deckles , " while those agreeing to make the paper in the new and novel manner were known as the " Stars . " After a reconciliation of the two factions Mr. Balston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grigsby , one of his workers and the leader of the Stars , who always wore on his jacket a ten-pointed star , denoting the number of vats in the mill , and gave him a sovereign for each point , bidding the vatman and touchers spend the money in jollification . The first organized union of papermakers in England was footnote * See Figures 51 , 52 , 55 for the use of the divided mould in China .  | founded in 1800 , but as early as 1784 there was a strike among the workers in this craft . The earliest recorded labour dispute in a paper mill antedated the founding of the union in England by more than four hundred years . This strike occurred in the Ulman Stromer mill , the earliest papermaking establishment in Germany ( Figure 201 ) . In the Germanic National Museum , Nurnberg , there is a manuscript diary entitled : Piichl von meim geslecht and von abenteurr ( Figure 202 ) . This manuscript , begun by Ulman Stromer about the year 1390 , not only is the first document in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the earliest controversy between capital and labour in the paper industry . Ulman Stromer was a member of the senate that governed Nurnberg , and his mill was located just outside the western wall of the city , at the point where the Pegnitz River emerges into the fields . Previous to his papermaking venture Stromer had been a merchant , and on his journeys of trade to  | Italy , where paper had been made since 1276 , he had seen the craft practised . He was convinced that he would be successful with an establishment of the same kind in his native Germany , especially if he could secure a monopoly in this work . No one in Nurnberg was versed in making paper , so it was necessary that the erstwhile trader procure his artisans elsewhere . He set out to find several foreigners who were skilled in the craft of papermaking , and after considerable deliberation succeeded in inducing a number of artisans to leave their positions in Lombardy . Ulman Stromer was at this time sixty-two years of age , and his experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After procuring the workers he forced them to swear to he loyal to him and to guard carefully the secrets of their craft so that there would be no likelihood of other mills springing up in Germany . Accordingly , Ulman Stromer wrote in his diary that Closen Obsser , the German he had engaged as foreman , " promised to be faithful unto me and declared on his oath that he would be true to me and my heirs , that he would be my overseer at the mill , keep me from harm , and that as long as he lived he would make paper for no one else save me and for my heirs and would not teach any man to make paper in any way at all . This took place on the Sunday next before St. Lawrence 's Day , in my room at the time of evening prayer in the year 1390 when my son Jorg was present . " Thus having his foreman 's faithfulness assured , Stromer proceeded to have his other German workers take the same oath . Ile recorded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after St. Lawrence when Jorg Tyrmann swore on oath to the saints that he would help my progress materially and that for ten years he would make paper only for me and my heirs and would not instruct anyone except by my sanction . But when the ten years are past he may make paper for himself , but for no one else , and he may then teach those who make paper for him , but for no one else , as long as he lives . " These men , like himself , were Germans , but with the skilled Italian workers Stromer felt there was need for extra precaution , so he took them before a procurator named Conradus , and Stro , ner 's sons , brother , and brother-in-law acted as witnesses to the affidavits . The contract with the Italian workmen read : " In the year 1390 , Franciscus de Marchia , and Marcus , his brother , and  | his manservant Bartholomeus pledged their loyalty to me and swore on oath of the holy saints that they would for ever be faithful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the German lands this side of the mountains of Normandy . " The precautions taken by Stromer to guard his own interests excited the suspicions of the Italians ; they concluded that if their labours were so indispensable to the success of the paper mill , it would be more to their advantage to control the mill themselves than to permit Stromer to be their master . With this thought in view the Lombards tried to hamper the progress of the mill in every possible manner , hoping that Stromer would become weary and discouraged with the whole venture and eventually lease the mill to them so that they might operate it as they pleased . Continuing with his diary , Ulman Stromer wrote : " the Italians were most troublesome the first year and caused me many difficulties , not suffering the third water-wheel to turn at all . My first two wheels operated eighteen stampers and even these were idle a great part of the time as the foreign workers wished to produce as little paper as possible so as to force me to allow them to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This I would not agree to do and they then offered to give me an amount of paper . From this I understood that they wished to ruin me and deprive me of my paper mill . " In medieval times the master had great authority over his workers . Stromer recorded in this diary : " In the year 1391 , on the twentieth of August , I took Franz and his brother Marcus and shut them in the tower . " On the fourth day of their imprisonment the unruly Italians sent for Stromer 's brother-in-law , thinking that he would be more lenient with them than Stromer himself . A reconciliation was effected and the two men were liberated on the fourth day , but not until they had sworn that they would cause no further trouble and would do their full share of work at the paper mill . The confinement in the tower had the desired result upon the scheming Italians and they worked more in harmony thereafter . Encouraged by the improved discipline , Ulman Stromer engaged additional papermakers , who were duly sworn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stampers and vats , for in  | 1392 Stromer recorded : " In my back room Erhart Zymerman has been engaged to be my servant for one year . He is to do the carpentry work at the mill or he will polish paper , and his wife will sort rags , or hang paper on lines to dry , or count the paper . Wages will be paid them , a good house in which to live and firewood withal . " Ulman Stromer operated the paper mill from 1390 to 1394 , when he leased the property to Jorg Tyrmann for a period of four years . Stromer died in the year 1407 at the age of seventy-nine . This manuscript diary is the most valuable document in the entire annals of papermaking . On June 20 , 1788 Benjamin Franklin ( 1706 ? 90 ) read before the members of the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia a treatise on papermaking , ' ' which was later published in footnote * Benjamin Franklin 's discussion of papermaking technique constitutes the only strictly American contribution to the bibliography of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eighty-two years of age when the following was communicated to the society : " In Europe to have a large surface of paper connected together and smooth on one side , the following operations are performed . 1 . A number of small sheets are to be made separately . 2 . These are to be couched , one by one , between blankets . 3 . When a heap is formed it must be put under a strong press , to force out the water . 4 . Then the blankets are to be taken away , one by one , and the sheets hung up to dry . 5 . When dry they are to be again pressed , or if to be sized , they must be dipped into size made of warm water , in which glue and alum are dissolved . 6 . They must be pressed again to force out the superfluous size . 7 . They must be hung up a second time to dry , which if the air happens to be damp requires some days . 8 .

In these the stuff is mixed ready to work . " Between these vats is built a kiln or stove , with two inclining sides ; each side somewhat larger than the sheet of paper ; they are covered with a fine stucco that takes a polish , and are so contrived as to be well heated by a small fire circulating in the walls . " The mould is made with thin but deep sides , that it may be both light and stiff : It is suspended at each end with cords that pass over pullies fastened to the ceiling , their ends connected with a counterpoise nearly equal to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the mould , lifting it out of the water by the help of the counterpoise , turn it and apply it with the stuff for the sheet , to the smooth surface of the stove , against which they press it , to force out great part of the water through the wires .

The side next the stove receives the even polish of the stucco , and is thereby better  | the Transactions of this society . ' Dr. Franklin describes in his essay the laborious method used in Europe for forming large sheets of paper , and then relates the simple manner employed by the Chinese papermakers in solving the difficulty ( Figure 203 ) .

" As the stove has two polished sides , and there are two vats , the same operation is at the same time performed by two men at the other vat ; and one fire serves . " Although Dr. Franklin 's observations are none too accurate , they do lead us to believe that he had far more than the layman 's conception of Chinese papermaking . In mentioning " wires " Franklin , of course , means the bamboos of the mould .  | clining sides of a heated oven or kiln , which gave one side of each sheet a remarkably smooth surface ( Figures 204 , 205 ) . Franklin states that by this method the Chinese workmen could make paper " four and an half ells long by one and an half ells wide . " ( The largest Chinese paper in the Paper Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 84 inches. )  | Benjamin Franklin 's interest in papermaking led him to have his own watermark , which may be seen in some of the paper upon which he printed , including copies of Poor Richard 's Almanac . The watermark consists of a fleur-de-lis within a shield , surmounted by a crown , with the initials B F in single-line lettering underneath . As further evidence of Franklin 's concern with paper there is a doggerel poem attributed to him in which different types of men are compared with various kinds of paper . Inasmuch as the verses mention ten varieties of paper in use in Franklin 's time and have seldom been printed , the poetic effort of the good doctor is given in full .

The Oriental papermakers have never had any standard sizes for paper , and throughout China , Japan , Korea , India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly . The largest Japanese mould ( see Figure 74 ) would be capable of producing sheets of paper 29 by 67 inches ( 1,943 square inches ) , the bamboo laid strips or reeds running lengthwise of the mould , as in European metal wire-covered moulds . This exceptionally large mould was procured near Okayama , a town in southwestern Japan , and had been used for making a paper called shod , used in lieu of glass in the windows of old-time Japanese houses ( Figure 193 ) . In Japan , as well as in China , sheets of paper have always been fabricated in almost every conceivable size , but in late years , owing to the exportation of paper from these countries , the paper has been to a great extent standardized . All through India , however , the sizes and methods remain much as they were hundreds of years ago . As no paper is exported from India , there is little need for uniformity , the various small cottage mills producing the paper for local markets only . In the southern Shan States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are of the " wove " type , being covered with woven cloth . This large size of paper is produced east of Taunggyi at Mong Kung , and the paper is termed kalats . These large sheets , like the Japanese shoji , are cut to suit the various purposes of the native population . The Shan paper is made from paper-mulberry bark ( Broussonetia pap yri f era ) . In Kashmir the sheets of paper measure about 26 by 30 inches , a surface of 780 square inches . During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries beautiful paper for manuscripts was made in Kashmir from rag stock . A village near Srinagar has long been  | the papermaking centre of Kashmir , and paper is still made in this region with clear and abundant water . In the Indian province of Bengal the paper usually measures about 21% by 22% inches in the uncut sheets , while in Tonkin , French Indo-China , where papermaking has been carried on undisturbed for hundreds of years , the moulds are smaller , averaging about 10 by 24 inches . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the old European sheets ; the Oriental papers have not changed in size through the centuries to the same extent as the European handmade papers . An idea of the cost of European paper in the fifteenth century may be gleaned from the prices that were paid by the directors of the Ripoli Press at Florence between 1474 and 1483 . An original cost-book of this establishment is preserved in the Biblioteca Nazionale in Florence . This book shows that the nine sizes or qualities of paper would have varied in price from about two dollars a ream for the lesser size or quality to about six dollars a ream for the Bologna paper in common folio . The oldest bill that is recorded showing the price of paper is dated 1352 and reads : " To George Cosyn , for one quartern of royal paper , to make painters ' patters , 10d . " According to this , a quire of royal paper in 1352 sold for about one third less than in the year 1483 . In the contract between William Rittenhouse and William Bradford , dated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye writing paper at 20 shillings the ream and ye brown paper at 6 shillings pr . ream . " The weekly wage of a papermaker in England during the latter part of the fifteenth century was from two to three shillings . When the prices paid for paper at this time are considered , the wage of a workman seems low , but at that time labour did not hold the same important place that it did in later years . During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the selling price of a ream of finished paper would have offset the weekly wage of one papermaker . In England during the early part of the eighteenth century a vatman earned from fifteen to eighteen shillings a week ; in America at that time the wage was a little higher than in the papermaking districts of southern England . Eighteen shillings a week was a high wage compared with that of other trades ; a bookbinder at that time received but twelve shillings a week and was required to work from six in the morning until nine at night , three hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting account which appeared in a little book of trades in 1747 gives some idea of the requirements at that time of both the master and the worker : " Papermaking requires much water and a great deal of room , and therefore is altogether carried on at water-mills in the country , which undertakings are not numerous . It goes through various operations and divers hands before it is completed , and the moulding part , which is the principal , requires a nice hand and good eye . They take with an apprentice 5 to 10 pounds who work from six to six , and he ought not to be a very tender lad ; they pay a journeyman moulder vatman 15 to 18 shillings a week ; and a mill with the proper utensils ( besides which there must be a reserve of at least 200 pounds , cash for a stock of rags , etc. ) will stand one , minded to be a master , in 100 pounds , of which some have two or three . It is a very curious art taken as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be encouraged at home more than it is . " From this account it will be seen that the life of a worker in an eighteenth-century paper mill was anything but indolent . He was required to be at the mill by six in the morning ready for work , and did not leave for his home until six in the evening . The noonday lunch was usually consumed while the men were working , but the more lenient masters allowed fifteen or twenty minutes for the repast . From the English book of trades of 1747 it would appear that papermakers at that time were looked upon with some degree of favour , but a hundred years earlier such was evidently not the case according to a petition dated 1636 to the Privy Council from the people of Buckinghamshire and Middlesex . These people living near the paper mills alleged that by converting corn mills into mills for the making of paper rents were advanced greatly and that the papermakers brought many poor and indigent to the parish whom they had to maintain . Also they complained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save more from their wages than was possible with workers in other trades . The people further alleged that the papermakers brought plague into the country from their rags , that they killed the fish by their double water-wheels and by penning up the water flooded the countryside . They also petitioned that the paper was poorly made and would bear ink only on one side and was sold much dearer than formerly .  | Many of the old German and French mills were provided with kitchens and sleeping-rooms which were used by some of the papermakers , others living in small cottages near their work . The papermaking centres were little communities in themselves , and many of the old artisans lived for one generation after another in the same spot , working at the same vat and with the same moulds that had been in use over long periods of time . In Holland it was the custom for some of the workers to live with the master of the mill where they were working , all having their meals at the same table.5 From time immemorial it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master of the house , by laying down his spoon , gave evidence that he had finished . There is a tradition that many of the early Dutch masters were anything but liberal , and that in order to prevent their workmen from consuming too much food , the dishes were served steaming hot , and before they had had time to cool sufficiently to be eaten , the master would lay down his spoon and the poor papermakers would be forced to leave their master 's table before their lusty appetites had been satisfied . To this day in the old papermaking districts of Holland whenever children are noticed to be gulping their food they are chided by their parents ' asking them if they have been reared by the papermakers . In the summertime the old Dutch artisans began their work in the mills at three thirty in the morning and ended their tasks at ten , the remainder of the day being spent in the fields and gardens , where they continued the constant stooping that was essential in the making of paper . The old workers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and robust constitutions , but the constant stooping posture , combined with the heat of the paper stock in the vat , caused them to grow old prematurely , and at fifty many of these hard-working craftsmen appeared to have reached the allotted threescore years and ten . During the eighteenth century a great deal of paper was produced in Holland , it being recorded that in the year 1726 there were sold at Amsterdam a hundred thousand reams in a single day . William Rittenhouse , the first papermaker in the province of Pennsylvania , had worked in Amsterdam as early as 1678 , when he was thirty-four years of age , but he had learned the craft of papermaking in his native city , Miilheim on the Ruhr . Rittenhouse was forty-four when he came to Pennsylvania in 1688 and it is  | interesting to surmise just how he had been influenced by the Dutch papermakers and to what extent he introduced the old Dutch customs into the pioneer paper mill of the New World . In contrast to the custom of the old Dutch mill-owners in endeavouring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's table , we have an account showing the abundance of food supplied by a master papermaker in early nineteenth-century America . In the amusing manuscript diary of Ebenezer Hiram Stedman , quoted from previously , there is an intimate description of paper-mill life in pioneer Kentucky and Ohio . Some time before the year 1820 Stedman left the mill in Kentucky and ventured across the river into Ohio , where he readily found work in the erstwhile Christian Waldschmidt mill , the second papermaking establishment to be set up in the state , about 1810 . An extract from the Stedman diary relative to mill life among the German immigrant papermakers reads : " . . . When Matthias Kugler came to the place he was an ignorant German , could not read or write ; he worked for eight dollars a month for the man ( Waldschmidt ) who was later to be his father-in-law . One day young Kugler was sent by his master to the barn to flail out grain and he and his master 's daughter got mixed up amongst the grain and Kugler had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthias Kugler was now the master of the mill and Mrs. Kugler was head of everything . The first meal I had in the mill-house was supper and Kugler had a practice of initiating every new journeyman papermaker who came to his house by telling them that all the food on the table was cooked for the papermakers and the family and each worker was entitled to consume as much as he desired , but everything taken on the plates must be eaten as there was to be no waste ; nothing was cooked to be thrown to the dogs or hogs . " This short quotation from Stedman 's interesting diary gives a little conception of the proprieties of the life of a papermaker in the " western country " during pioneer days when the craft of making paper by hand was practised in the Miami Valley , now an important paper-producing centre . The old European papermakers , as well as the early American workers at this craft , were much too fond of their drink and could be found almost any night at the public houses which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who interchanged  | their work , could readily have been distinguished by their red , muscular arms and hands and by their stooping backs . This condition was brought about by their having their arms in and out of warm water constantly , and continually bending over the dippingvat and coucher 's stool . The old mills were inadequately heated , and the vat-houses , where the moulding of the paper took place , were usually located where the light was poor , the atmosphere damp and gloomy , and the whole environment unhealthful ( Figures 206 , 207 , 208 ) . All through the history of papermaking by hand there was a scarcity of workers , due no doubt to the unwillingness of apprentices to learn a trade so disagreeable and arduous ; only those with exceptional physical endurance could have remained long at the craft . The greatest strain was required of the vatman , owing to the four-way motion that he had to give to the mould in forming each separate sheet of paper . After work-  | ing years at the vat the craftsmen sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form a sheet of paper . Sometimes this paralysis has been known to attack workmen for different periods , during which time they were unable to work at the moulding of paper ; then the ability to give the " stroke " or " shake " returned . Yet with all the disagreeable features of their craft , the old papermakers were a happy and contented guild of workmen . As in other callings , there were those who disliked the monotony of living and working in one place , and these men journeyed from one mill to another , obtaining work wherever they might go . The papermakers were extremely proud of their craft , for the apprenticeship was long , the work demanded dexterity and skill , and to become a proficient moulder and coucher of fine paper required no little ability of head and hand . Nothing remains today of the old handmade-paper industry in America , since here , though not in the Old World , the advent of the papermaking machine soon swept aside the ancient , tedious  | method of forming each sheet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War all papermaking by hand had ceased on the North American continent . Most of the buildings that housed this important early industry have gone into decay , and not a vestige of any of the old equipment , except a few scattered moulds , remains . The original Rittenhouse mill , ? the first to be established in America , in 1690 , near Germantown , Pennsylvania , was swept away by high water in 1700 , but Rittenhouse and his son Claus built another mill , a short distance below the site of the first , which was in operation in 1702 . There is no authoritative picture of the original mill or of the second structure . According to the letters of William McCulloch 7 to Isaiah Thomas written between 1812 and 1815 , the original Rittenhouse mill was of logs , the building extending over an undershot water-wheel , there being no dam or race . This Philadelphia antiquarian also states in his letters : " The Rittenhouses , one or more of them , have continued paper-  | makers to this day . The first stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large press with a screw , made of cherry , about eighteen inches diameter in the eye . This press verily appears to be an ancient affair . The mill is not at present employed by a Rittenhouse . It is rented as a paper mill ; and the present papermaker Nicholas Rittenhouse employs another mill in the vicinity . . . . Jacob Rittenhouse made the large wooden screw , which was about the year 1755 for his uncle William . Jacob , the millwright , also invented , about the year 1760 , the slanting plates for grinding rags ; as straight ones only , with much delay of grinding , were in use before this discovery . . . . Jacob is still living , he is now 86 years of age , is blind , but retains an excellent memory unimpaired . " The buildings usually pictured as the Rittenhouse paper mill are two stone houses that are still standing . The larger of these was built in 1707 and was originally the home of William Rittenhouse and his son Claus , there being carved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C R. This picturesque old stone 1707 house , with its steep , narrow , winding stairway and small cheerful rooms , is often pictured as the Rittenhouse paper mill , but was used only as a residence , never as a mill . To the public at large this old two-storey structure is better known today as the birthplace of David Rittenhouse ( 1732-96 ) , the astronomer , than as the home of William Rittenhouse , the pioneer papermaker . It may be said without hesitation that nothing remains of the actual Rittenhouse mill , either the building or the equipment . Indeed , even the spot where this mill stood is unknown , nor will it ever be possible to trace the exact location with certainty . A like fate has overtaken the William De Wees mill , the second paper mill to be set up in the colonies . Of the buildings that housed it nothing remains . This mill , built in 1710 , was a direct outgrowth of the Rittenhouse establishment , erected near the pioneer mill , on the west side of the Wissahickon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Crefield . The earliest reference in any publication to the Rittenhouse mill or to papermaking in America appeared in Philadelphia ( printed by William Bradford ) in 1692 and was written by Richard Frame ,  | the title of the book being : A Short Description of Pennsylvania , or , A Relation of What Things are Known , Enjoyed , and Like to he Discovered in the Said Province . Presented as a Token of Good Will to the People of England . The verses are printed in full : The German-Town , of which I spoke before , Which is , at least in length one Mile or more , Where lives High-German People , and Low-Dutch , Whose Trade in weaving Linen Cloth is much . There grows the Flax , as also you may know , That from the same they do divide the Tow ; Their trade fits well within this Habitation , We find Convenience for their Occasion .

Also , when on our backs it is well worn , Some of the same remains Ragged and Torn ; Then of the Rags our Paper it is made , Which in process of time dost waste and fade ; So , what comes from the Earth , appeareth plain , The same in Time , returns to Earth again . The following verse was written by John Holme in 1696 under the title of A True Relation of the Flourishing State of Pennsylvania , 8 and is considered to have been the earliest metrical composition composed in Pennsylvania , but it was not published until 1847 . The verse relates to William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printer and I find That he can both print books and bind ; He wants not paper , ink , nor skill He 's owner of a paper mill .  | The paper mill is here hard by And makes good paper frequently , But the printer , as I do here tell , Is gone into New York to dwell . No doubt but he will lay up bags If he can get good store of rags . Kind friend , when thy old shift is rent Let it to th ' paper mill be sent . Another work dealing in a minor degree with Pennsylvania papermaking appeared two years after John Holme 's verse , in 1698 , with the title : An Historical and Geographical Account of the Province and Country of Pennsylvania . This was published in London , and the reference to paper is : " All sorts of very good paper are made in German-Town , as also very fine German linen such as no person of quality need be asham 'd to wear . " The third mill , also in the province of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1729 , on the west branch of Chester Creek in that part of Chester County which in later years became Delaware County . It is recorded that as late as 1884 some of the buildings of this mill were standing , but whether or not these were part of the original structure it is not possible to say . When I visited the site of this old mill a number of years ago , nothing remained but the stone foundation , which stood in soggy ground almost covered with rank vegetation . A remnant of the old ivy vine , the original slip of which was brought to this country by Thomas Willcox from Devonshire in 1725 , still clung to the ruined walls . It was on account of the abundant growth of this vine that the mill in its prosperous days was known as " Ivy Mills , " and carried the device of an ivy leaf as its watermark . At the base of one of the crumbling masonry walls , deeply embedded in the marshy ground , lay a rusty and broken screw press fallen upon its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old mill , and between its platens ream after ream of paper had been pressed ? paper that had been made for ante-bellum banks , for the counting houses of some of America 's oldest firms , and for the banks of the South American republics as well as those of Greece . It was not until March 1866 that the mill abandoned the manufacture of handmade paper . On the hill above the mill stands the old Willcox home , occupied by a direct descendant of this noted  | papermaking family . The old Willcox family burying-ground , enclosed within an iron fence , lies up the hill behind the house , and here rest this illustrious family of papermakers . Within the enclosure , but to one side , a small gravestone with the one word CAESAR marks the tomb of an old Negro slave whom Thomas Willcox had purchased from the captain of a slave-trading ship that had anchored in Delaware Bay . Caesar had been a faithful and intelligent papermaker in the Willcox mill , and at his death he was privileged to share the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was established on the banks of the Cocalico Creek , near Ephrata , Lancaster County , Pennsylvania , by a branch of the Pietists of Germany , who came to this country in the early eighteenth century . This was the fourth paper mill in Pennsylvania . ' ? When the site of this mill was visited more than a quarter century ago , there was nothing of the old buildings remaining ; not even the foundations could be traced , for a woollen factory had been built upon the spot where the mill once stood . The building usually pictured in histories as the original Papiermuhle of this German religious colony was never a mill of any sort , but the home of one of the leaders of the cult . Not the oldest citizens of Ephrata could remember seeing the paper mill ; it had been demolished many years before and no authentic picture exists . Another locality visited , with the hope of finding at least a remnant of an early American paper mill , was the site of an early papermaking establishment in New York , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake , a peaceful body of water that flows into the head of Hempstead Harbour , at Roslyn , Long Island . This enterprise was founded by Hendrick Onderdonk and two associates encouraged thereto by Hugh Gaine , a bookseller and printer of New York . The mill was prosperous and Onderdonk became a wealthy and influential man , living in a correspondingly handsome style . Whenever a noted personage came to the village , the master of the paper mill was invariably called upon to entertain him , as Onderdonk was the leader in the small community . On the morning of April 24 , 1790 word came suddenly to the village , and to the Onderdonk household in particular , that the President of the United States was on his way through the island , and that he would stop with the papermill owner for  | breakfast.11 The Onderdonk family was around the table eating roasted clams when the message was received , and a great commotion arose among the women to get things in readiness for the honoured guest . They sprang from their benches , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saucers , soon having the table cleared for a more formal repast for General Washington . After breakfast the President and Hendrick Onderdonk strolled to the hill west of the pond , and the General remarked that the locality would make an excellent place for a fort . They then visited the paper mill , Washington seeming much interested in the process of forming sheets of paper and asking many questions in regard to the methods employed . He was much absorbed in watching the men dip and couch the thin sheets , one at a time , and the vatman summoned sufficient courage politely to request that the President try his hand at the work . This Washington did , dipping the " laid " mould into the vat and bringing it to the surface laden with the snowy-white fibrous liquid . He then couched the sheet , the workman taking care to slip a small bit of paper between the felts that covered the sheet the noted visitor had made . Perhaps this means of identification was later found unnecessary , as the paper formed by a novice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that this sheet was a cherished possession of the mill for many years , but no trace of it can now be found . To be sure , there is no authentic record to support the story that George Washington actually made a sheet of paper when he visited the Onderdonk mill , but the situation is sufficiently picturesque for one at least to wish that it might have been true . One historian of Long Island has advanced the opinion that such a performance never took place , the only reason given being that it would have been beneath the dignity of the Father of our Country to stoop to such a workaday task ; but , it would seem , Washington could have made just one sheet of paper without losing his rank as a gentleman ! There have been several authentic instances of European nobility visiting paper mills and trying their skill in forming paper upon a mould . Charles Cowan in his Reminiscences relates that the Duke of Bordeaux , better known as Count de Chambord ( 1820 ? 83 ) , once visited the Valleyfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paper upon a small mould . After the sheets had dried they were  | forwarded to His Royal Highness at Holyrood Palace and were graciously acknowledged . Surely if it were not beneath the dignity of a nobleman in imperialistic Europe to stand at a vat and make a few sheets of paper , our own George Washington could have performed the same task in democratic America without the loss of too much prestige . General Washington was evidently much impressed by his visit to the Onderdonk mill , for in his diary under the date of his sojourn he had this to say : " I left Mr. Young 's , Oyster Bay , before 6 o'clock on Saturday morning and passing through Mosquito Cove , breakfasted at a Mr. Onderdonk 's at the head of a little bay where we were kindly received and well entertained . This gentleman works a grist and two paper mills , the last of which he seems to carry on with spirit and profit . " George Washington was the possessor of his own watermarked correspondence paper and at least a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this form of stationery . The watermark is in the form of a circle with the lettering GEORGE WASHINGTON in outline running within the frame , the circle surmounted by a griffin or eagle . In the centre of the watermark a figure of Liberty sits somewhat uncomfortably upon a plough . It is not known where the paper was made , but it is likely that an American mill kept the General supplied as a favour . The old stone foundations of the Onderdonk mill are all that now remain of Long Island 's first paper mill . Within the low foundation a great tree grows which clearly shows how long ago the wooden mill had fallen into ruin . Of the old American paper mills , the best- ( , preserved structure is one that was erected in ? . the late eighteenth century . It stands in Burnside , Connecticut , on the outskirts of Hartford , appearing most dignified and substantial amid its shabby modern surroundings . Originally it stood in the country , beside a stream , but houses and factories have pressed closer and closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The impressive building is about 30 by 40 feet , two storeys in height , and built of red sandstone , each block beautifully squared , and all laid together faultlessly in massive walls . By contrast the neigh-  | bouring present-day buildings look mean and poor . The first floor of this old stone mill is divided into two rooms ; one served as the vat-house , the other for the beating of rags . The second floor was used for drying and finishing ; the original sliding shutters that had been used to introduce or exclude the air for the drying of paper are still intact and in fairly good working order . By going over this small building it is possible to picture every phase of the old hand process and to determine just how the artisans operated . The limitations of light and space and the crude appliances did not seem to deter the early workers , and not only did the paper they fabricated serve its purpose at the time , but much of it has lasted throughout the years and given to us the records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give here complete historical accounts of these few early American mills , since this has been ably done in other volumes , but to set down brief descriptions of them as they now exist , so that a student of the history of papermaking in this country will know what to expect when he visits the  | sites of these pioneer paper mills . Papermaking in America grew early into a flourishing industry . At the close of the eighteenth century there were numerous small paper mills , and by the year 1810 there were no fewer than one hundred and eighty-five establishments where paper was made ( Figure 209 ) . Previous to the first World War England had six mills devoted to this craft . Of the 1,043 vats that existed in Germany in 1846 , only two or three remained in 1938 ; while in Holland , a great papermaking country , there were at this same period only three or four vats in operation . In 1938 Italy had a number of handmadepaper mills , and in France at this time two small establishments were still making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one lone mill ( Figure 210 ) . In Asia the number of small cottage mills where paper is formed by hand is amazing , but these establishments would not be comparable to those of Europe . Between thirteen and fourteen hun-  | clred individual handmade-paper mills existed in Japan in 1934 , many of them operated within the small homes of the owners as cottage industries ( Figure 211 ) . There were a number of large handmade-paper mills in Japan , however , several of them employing hundreds of workers , both men and women ( Figure 212 ) . According to the bulletin issued by the Bureau of Trade of the province of Chekiang , China , in 1935 , it was estimated that in this one province alone 24,437 individual households were engaged in making paper by hand , employing 126,852 workers.12 Most of this paper finds use in religious rites and ceremonies . In the whole of China before the Japanese aggression , there were at least 40,000 cottages where paper was made in the traditional manner ( Figures 213 , 214 ) . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Siam only two or three hand mills remained , and in India a census might list two or three hundred individual owners of establishments making paper by hand , each employing from three to a dozen artisans . The paper made in the Netherlands East Indies is of the beaten type and can not be classed as true paper , made from disintegrated fibre .  | Ancient Watermarks SIX AND A HALF CENTURIES OF MYSTIC SYMBOLS THE STUDY of watermarks attracted little attention until the early eighteenth century , when several writers on typographical subjects became sufficiently interested in the history of paper to devote a little of their research to papermaking archaeology . During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries a number of works in French , German , Italian , Russian , Dutch , Spanish , and English were compiled dealing with the historical importance of old watermarks , and the past twenty years have seen an increasing interest in their lore . Several French and German antiquaries devoted their lives to the subject of watermarking , but so difficult is the study that no writer has satisfactorily fathomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every scholar who has written on the subject has advanced a different theory of their origin , utility , and meaning . Their symbolic aspect has been dealt with thoroughly , and numerous antiquarians have reproduced and indexed literally thousands of old watermarks from the thirteenth century onward , but without a definite theory of their inception and use . It has been suggested that these archaic devices may have been used solely as marks of identification for sizes of moulds and the paper formed thereon , or as trade-marks of the papermakers who fashioned them . Others have advanced the theory that they may have been employed in a purely symbolic sense , as Harold Bayley 1 sets forth in his interesting books dealing with the semeiotic significance of the old papermakers ' and printers ' marks and emblems . According to Mr. Bayley , the watermarks of the Middle Ages were employed by heretical papermakers as symbols of religious propaganda . Europe at that time was overrun with mystic and puritanical sects , and the art of papermaking was one of the  | most developed trades of these religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papermaking districts were precisely those that were strongholds of the heretical sects known as the Albigenses . The word Albigenses ' is a term applied loosely to the various preReformation reformers whose strongholds stretched from Northern Spain across the southern provinces of France to Lombardy and Tuscany . In Spain and France they were known as Albigenses from Albi , the name of one of the prominent towns . In the Alpine provinces they were called Waldenses , from Peter Waldo , one of their most conspicuous members . In Italy , history alludes to them under the terms Cathari or Patarini . " Mr. Bayley attaches symbolic importance to each of the watermarks used by these mystic people and believes that the papermarks carried with them signals of hidden meaning . This seems really more probable than to try to account for the multitude of watermarked designs as marks of identification for paper sizes or as trade-marks of the makers . It is not entirely out of the way to suggest that the old watermarks were perhaps nothing more than a mere fancy with the papermakers , who may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natures . In the entire craft of papermaking there is no part more interesting or fascinating than to couch a sheet of paper upon the felting and watch the impressed mark become clear and distinct as the water slowly evaporates . Another supposition regarding the use of the early papermarks is that since many of the workmen could not read , it was necessary to appeal to them by means of pictures . Simply to have marked a mould with letters or figures would have meant little to the artisans of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries ; it was essential to convey the meaning to them by the aid of illustrations . For the same reason the old signboards of inns and shops were always of a pictorial nature ; the mere name of the tavern lettered upon the swinging sign , or of the commodity sold by the tradesmen , would not have been sufficient . At the present time watermarks are trade-marks of the papermakers , pure and simple , but their ancient significance must remain more or less obscure . It is possible , however , to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into sheets of paper . In ancient Oriental papers no watermarks of symbols or devices  | are found . The earliest moulds upon which sheets of paper were formed were constructed of bamboo , a material that did not lend itself readily to forming applied designs which would watermark the paper . This fact may be sufficient to account for the absence of such marks in early Oriental papers . In the Paper Museum collection of Chinese papermaking moulds dating from fifty to a hundred years ago there is a mould-cover bearing a watermark ( Figure 215 ) . The three characters ( Ting Jui T'ai ) represent the name of the papermakers and are made of ramie ( China grass ) . The lines of these characters are sufficiently flexible to assume any contour taken by the mould-cover during the couching process . In Europe it is likely that iron wires were used in making the first Occidental mould-covers when the art of papermaking was introduced into Spain about the year 1151 , yet papermarks did not make their appearance until more than a century later . The first use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while they were lacking in complication of design , the forms of the emblems lead us to believe that they may have been employed as signals or symbols for conveying meanings among the workers who made them , or among those who used the pa-  | per in which the simple outline designs were impressed . The use of papermarks soon became general and hundreds of different devices were employed in every papermaking country throughout Europe . Watermarks multiplied in number through the centuries , until there were literally thousands upon thousands of different designs depicting almost every phase of nature and every human endeavour . About 1450 , when printing from movable types was introduced into Europe , the art of watermarking paper was an accomplishment almost two centuries old . But when we consider nature 's use of printing and watermarking from the beginning of time , it is indeed strange that man was so backward in his adoption of the arts of impression . Did not animals , no matter how remote , leave impressions or stamps of their feet in the sands , and vegetation impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or indentations , are closely akin to the arts of watermarking and printing . In examining old books a great profusion of watermarks may be noted in the paper of an individual volume , some fifteenthcentury works containing a dozen or more different papermarks in a single book . To account for this variety some writers contend that it was necessary for the early printers to purchase their paper from scattered mills to enable them to procure sufficient material for their use , claiming that the mills were small and could not manufacture paper in sufficient quantities , uniform in size , thickness , and watermark . It is possible that such a course might have been essential in the fifteenth century , but it would not have seemed expedient in the sixteenth ; for by the sixteenth century paper manufacture had become an important industry of vigorous growth in most European countries . It is recorded in Thomas Churchyard 's poem ? that John Spilman , who operated a paper mill in England in 1588 , employed as many as six hundred workers , and England was not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably erroneous , for in the half dozen mills of England today there are hardly this number of workers employed in making handmade paper ; the methods of work do not differ greatly from those of several centuries ago . In the sixteenth century it is certain that supplies of book footnote * See page 120.  | paper were abundant , yet in individual books printed in this century various papermarks are found . It has been suggested that the different watermarks denoted various sizes of paper . This does not seem reasonable ; with every size of paper a special pair of moulds would have been needed and the labour and expense of fashioning these moulds were too great to permit of such a vast variety of dimensions . In later years , to be sure , such marks as foolscap , hand , post , pott , etc. , did denote sizes of paper , but these appellations were not used as size names until many years after the establishment of these particular emblems as watermarks ; moreover , there were many mills using the same designs on different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1479 , but in England was later replaced by the figure of Britannia , the mark for this size of paper . Watermarks of pots or jugs are seldom found after the seventeenth century , being replaced by the Netherlands or English arms . Watermarks of hands were used extensively by the old papermakers in Germany and the Netherlands , and at times this mark resembled an iron gauntlet or glove , the initials or name of the maker often appearing on the wrist . According to several writers , the posthorn watermark first appeared in the year 1670 , at the time the General Post Office was established in England . This is doubtless a mistake , as marks of this type have been found in documents upon paper bearing dates as early as the latter part of the fourteenth century . The art of forming the actual wire watermark emblems that were applied to the moulds has been modified but little since their origin in the late thirteenth century . In Europe before the eighteenth century all paper was made on " laid " moulds , and the sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " chain " wires used in the construction of the moulds . Any wirework , in the form of objects , added to the top surface of this " laid " and " chain " wire covering ( Figure 216 ) also made impressions in the paper . Why these indentations were called watermarks is not known , as the mark or device in paper is not caused by the use of water to any greater extent than is the sheet itself . In the German language the design impressed in the paper is called Wasserzeichen , which , like the English term " watermark , " is confusing . In the French language the appellation is filigrane , and in  | Dutch papiermerken . These two names are more suitable . The first use of the term " watermark " in English appeared at the beginning of the eighteenth century , and as the name Wasserzeichen was apparently not used by German writers until the first part of the nineteenth century , we are led to believe that the name " watermark , " faulty in its meaning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The twisted forms used in producing the watermarks , or papermarks , were for centuries held in place on the surface of the moulds by means of thread-like wires ? stitched back and forth , binding the mark to the " laid " and " chain " wires . In much of the old paper it is possible to detect the sewing-on wires around the watermarks when the sheets are held to a bright light . In many of the early papermarks the sewing-on wires are pronounced , owing to wire having been used that was almost as heavy as the wire of the mark itself . At least one writer has stated that the wire designs were fastened to the mould surfaces by the use of soft solder , but this appears to be a mistake , as this method of securing the watermarking wires in place was apparently not used until the first part of the nineteenth century . In watermarks from the thirteenth century the simplicity is striking , as at that time the devices were made of clumsy wire that would not admit of- much twisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wires gradually became finer and the designs more detailed . The value of watermarks as a means of determining the dates of paper , books , and prints or the locality where the paper was made is to be questioned . Few of the early watermarks bear date ' , and even when they do , the date of the mark must not be a : cep ed as the time of the printing on the paper . The sheets might have been dated in the watermark and then remained in the mill a considerable time before the paper was sold , and after being sold the paper might have been held for years in the warehouse of the printer before being used . Paper made from fine materia= by careful and conscientious workmen should improve with age , seasoning adding to its printing quality . The early printers were doubt- footnote * In modern practice the watermark designs in wire are sewed to the hand-moulds by means of fine steel wire that has been plated with a nonrusting metal .  | less aware of this characteristic . Also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same date , the papermaker not troubling to change the figures . An example of such a discrepancy in dates in modern times is seen in a letter to me from the late Joseph Willcox , a direct descendant of the founder of Ivy Mills , the third paper mill to be established in Pennsylvania . Joseph Willcox took over the management of the mill in Chester in 1859 , and there made the last handmade bank-note paper that was produced in the United States . His letter reads in part : " We had an order for an unusual size of paper and the only moulds we had of the particular size were dated 1810 in the watermarks . I did not like to take off that old date so I made a lot of paper with the mark 1810 in every sheet . " This made a difference of almost fifty years from the date in the paper and the time when the paper was actually made . It would also be unwise to rely upon a watermark as proof of where the paper was made or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reputation for a superior quality of paper ; there was nothing to prevent a newly set-up mill from using the watermark of the older and more prosperous concern . A striking illustration of this deception in our own time is the imitation of the watermark of the highly esteemed Whatman mill , established by James Whatman in Maidstone , England , in 1731 . Certain unscrupulous Continental papermakers have duplicated the Whatman watermark and sold their papers without hesitation , the sheets often being accepted as genuine Whatman papers . It is not unlikely that in the early days of papermaking , moulds were sold by one mill to another without troubling to remove the wire watermarks ; or the old worn moulds of a large mill may have fallen into the hands of a less prosperous maker who fabricated an inferior quality of paper . In this way one watermark design cogld have been used by numerous mills , over periods of many veais , for papermaking moulds have always been well and strongly ade and they do not easily wear beyond use if treated with any degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great interest , but for tracing definitely the dates ) f paper , or the exact localities of certain mills , the marks should of be relied upon implicitly . Almost all writers touching upon the subject of ancient paper  | and watermarks attach importance to small changes that often appear in papermarks depicting the same subject . This seems to be unwarranted , for the slight variations may be due to very simple causes . The wire forms may have become detached from the moulds and have been replaced by a worker unskilled in wireworking ? possibly the vatman or coucher . Every time a wire mark came loose from a mould , it had to be attached again , and in so doing some detail naturally was slightly changed from the original outline . This alone would account for the large number of marks , similar in subject , and supposedly from the same mill , but varying to a slight degree . Another simple cause for variance may be suggested : In the first volume of the Mazarin Bible , attributed to Johann Gutenberg , and printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papermarks of the bull or ox . In these two papermarks there is a striking resemblance ; no doubt one was a copy of the other , and the two were supposed to be identical . It is probable that so late as the fifteenth century two moulds were used , as at present , in moulding paper at the vat . Each mould had a wire watermark of a bull , the two possibly formed by different workers , each one trying to rival the other in design , but keeping the two emblems within the same limits of space and general contour . ? The paper that was used in the forty-two-line Bible is of the finest quality and in many ways its excellence has never been surpassed . The watermark of the bunch of grapes ( Figure 217 ) which is found in much of the Gutenberg Bible paper is unusual in its footnote In the history of papermaking in our own country this variation of papermarks of the same subject is not unusual . For the past several years I have been making a study of early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many of the late eighteenth- and early nineteenthcentury watermarks used in these states have been measured and photographed . In practically all of the papers made in the pioneer mills in the " western country " a marked variation in the watermarks is detectable . To cite but one instance : In Ohio the first papermaking establishment was set up in 1807 . The watermark was a spread eagle with the word OHIO underneath in outline letters . All of the watermarks from this mill were intended to be identical , but apparently no standard pattern or template was employed in forming or twisting the wires . It is possible , therefore , to determine upon what particular mould a certain sheet of paper was formed . Through an examination of many sheets of paper in early account-books , documents , letters , etc. , we have been able to arrive at the actual number of moulds each mill possessed .  | brilliance and clearness , although the paper is long-fibred , which , as a rule , does not produce sharp and distinct watermarks . The strength of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is desired . While the bunch of grapes as a papermark may be of Swiss origin , it is possible that the paper used in the first printed Bible was fabricated in Gutenberg 's native land . No matter in what locality it was made , or in what particular mill , this paper shows technical skill and workmanship that is seldom encountered in modern times ; the texture , strength , and tone have remained unchanged over almost five hundred years . Through the employment of bleach and chemicals , much of the machine-made paper and some of the handmade paper of our own time , even with the nearly five-hundred-year handicap , will no doubt suffer by comparison with that of the Gutenberg Bible in another such period , or about the year 2446 . After watermarking became general , during the fifteenth century , it was seldom that a sheet of paper was made without a distinguishing device of some nature . These emblems were sometimes placed in the centre of the sheets , or where the paper was folded in folio book-printing , but it is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the half-sheet of paper . Watermarks , from their origin until the latter part of the eighteenth century , when they began to lose their simplicity , may be consistently divided into four classes : The first of these would embrace the earliest known watermarks , which appeared in the form of crosses , ovals , circles , knots , triangles , three-hill symbols , and devices of the simplest kind that could have been readily twisted in wire . At this period a great many pommee crosses were also used as emblems for watermarking paper . This was a Greek cross with balls or circles placed at each end of the cross-bars . Another similar mark which is found in fourteenth-century Italian paper is a circle surmounted by a patriarchal or papal cross . The papermarks of this first group were in use from the origin of the art , about the year 1282 , until the first quarter of the fifteenth century . The second division of papermarks would include man and the works of man , and in the latter class of this particular group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands upon thousands of designs . The male figure is met with only in limited numbers and the female figure is rarely found except in  | mermaid form , usually holding a mirror . The human head , feet , and hands were also used separately as watermarks by the early workers . The mark of the hand was used by the papermakers of various countries for hundreds of years and was symbolic of both Fidelity and Labour . At times the hand shows two fingers bent downward , a sign of benediction . The hand watermark is also found surmounted by a cross , a star , a rose of bliss , or some like ornament , each of which had its symbolic significance . The size of paper known in later years as " hand " derived its name from the emblem . The watermark of the human foot is exceptional and has been encountered in only a few instances . The works of man would embrace agricultural implements , and small tools such as shears , spades , bellows , swords , scythes , hammers , pruning-hooks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be included such watermarked objects as ships , anchors , anvils , bagpipes , keys , horns , scales , bishops ' and cardinals ' hats and staffs , curry-combs , weapons of all kinds , hawks ' bells , as well as architectural ornaments , lettering , and escutcheons . The earliest watermark of the human head was a portrait of Jesus Christ , and was of French origin , from about the year 1339 . This device represents the Vera Icon , or True Image . The legend runs that the Saviour on the way to Calvary was encountered by the woman Berenice . Filled with compassion she wiped His face with her handkerchief , which miraculously retained an imprint of the divine features , whereupon Berenice was sainted and rechristened Veronica , an anagram of Vera Icon . It is no doubt the kerchief with the impress of this head that is reproduced in the late fourteenth-century watermark . Watermarks of Jesus in profile appeared in limited numbers during the fourteenth , fifteenth , and sixteenth centuries . In these marks the head is usually represented with three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ 's oneness with the Trinity . In most of these marks the mouth is open , intended to denote Jesus teaching . Another profile watermark used in the fifteenth century was that of a Negro slave . In some instances this head appears with a bandage raised from the eyes , symbolizing freedom . Most of the early watermarks portraying the human figure and head were ecclesiastical in nature , as was natural since the church  | penetrated the workshops of the ancient craftsmen in a manner that can not be conceived today . Nothing really artistic in the watermarking of portraits was accomplished until the middle of the eighteenth century , when we find the French and German papermakers making simple outline portraits of prominent personages . In arranging papermarks in classes according to their subjects , the third group or division would embrace such marks as flowers , trees , leaves , vegetables , grain , plants , and fruits . In a number of the old emblems there are also combinations of vegetation and the works of man , such as a bunch of grapes with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers or leaves . The fourth and probably the most interesting group of watermarks would include wild , domesticated , and legendary animals , as well as snakes , fish , snails , turtles , crabs , scorpions , and all varieties of insects . It was the forms of animals that required most dexterity to twist in wire and gave the early artisans the greatest outlet for their skill . The bull 's head , one of the earliest animal papermarks , made its appearance in 1310 and was a favourite emblem with papermakers for over two hundred years . The head of the bull was sometimes used without appurtenances , but more often it is found surmounted by a Latin cross , rose of bliss , halfmoon , crown , flails , or like symbols . We find also a curled snake on the staff of a cross projecting from the bull's-head device , resembling a caduceus . Watermarks of the head of the bull , surmounted by both a snake and cross and the rose of bliss are found in some of the sheets of paper that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1536 ? the first Bible printed in English . The bull's-head mark ( Figure 218 ) in various forms also appears in paper that was used by William Caxton , Colard Mansion , Gerhard Leeu , and other noted printers who procured their paper from the Low Countries . The full figure of the bull is not so common a watermark as the head alone , but when it does appear it is interesting to note that the tail is usually divided into three strands . The bull as a symbol was handed down to the papermakers by the ancients , for chief among the multitude of idols and symbols was the god Apis , represented by the bull . The ox was emblematic of patience and strength , and in the writings of some of the early church Fathers it is accepted as a symbol of Christ the true sacrifice , also of prophets , apostles , and saints slain for  | the sake of Christ , and of all who patiently bear the yoke and labour in silence for the good of others . The unicorn , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by Caxton , and holds a prominent place in papermarks from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century . M. Briquet has recorded over eleven hundred different renderings of this animal used as a device for marking paper . The unicorn was symbolic of purity and innocence , and it was believed that the horn of this mythical animal was a panacea for all illness and an antidote for poisons .  | The ancients believed the horn of the unicorn so sensitive that if a cup of poison was brought near it , a thick moisture would be expelled from the surface of the liquid , and if a piece of horn was thrown into the poison , the poison would bubble and in time boil over . It was also thought by the ancients that the horn was removable at will , like a kind of sword . Both the whole body and the head of the unicorn were used as watermarks by the old papermakers . They are seldom found as papermarks with any other symbol incorporated with them , but in a few instances a sword or cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another favourite animal watermark was the form of the dog , and numerous specimens are found extending over a period of about two hundred years . Like the bull and the unicorn , the dog device was used as a symbolic emblem by the ancients , and centuries later , along with other symbols , was adopted by papermakers for watermarking . Certain species of the canine were considered sacred by the ancient Egyptians and there are instances where sacred dogs were mummified by them . Early watermarks of the dog usually represent the greyhound , and a great many of them are drawn with considerable motion and vigour , a merit not often found in old papermarks . The camel is prominent in the watermarks of the fifteenth century and is usually of crude workmanship and seen in a rather grotesque attitude . The camel mark here illustrated ( Figure 219 ) shows the actual wire form on the surface of the mould . It was constructed of two wires , one starting at the ears and continuing around , shaping the tail and legs and terminating at the neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being shaped by a crook in the second wire . This camel papermark is French , from about 1379 . Elephants , leopards , goats , lambs , dragons , cats , horses , and deer are found in abundance in watermarks from the middle of the fourteenth century onward . The cock is not a common mark in old paper , but a variety of specimens , mostly of French origin , have been discovered in the pages of antique books and manuscripts . Many of the chanticleer marks display ability in design as well as fashioning in wire . It is noticeable that the cock was generally formed with open bill , which , according to the authorities on symbolism , denotes the dawn of light . Birds of many kinds and  | During the first fifty years of papermaking in the American colonies there still existed among craftsmen a love for symbolic design , which was manifest in the watermarks of the period . But by the middle of the eighteenth century superstition and symbolism began to lose hold upon the artisans , and from that time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printers ' marks began to fall into disuse . Watermarks with an emblematic significance were not uncommon in the early papermaking history of Pennsylvania , and the pioneer workers of this region were responsible for the most unusual specimens . New England , which con-  | tributed so much to the history of the applied arts in other fields , added little of an artistic or interesting nature to the watermark annals of America . The few marks that are recorded from this locality consist chiefly of names and initials of the papermakers , which have no special appeal to the imagination ( Figure 220 ) . The first paper mill in the colonies , as has been said , was established in Pennsylvania by William Rittenhouse , a native of Germany , who was assisted in his undertaking by William Bradford , the first printer in Pennsylvania and New York , and two other worthy gentlemen . In all probability the papermaking moulds used by this mill had been brought from the chief founder 's native land and were no doubt plain moulds , without watermarks . The first watermark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " designating the original partnership . Judging from its crudity , it was fashioned by untrained and unskilled hands , probably by one of the mill workmen unaccustomed to forming objects in wire . This mark was used from about 1690 , when the mill was established , until some time during the year 1704 , when Bradford was induced to part with his share in the paper mill . In 1706 the property was in the full possession of Rittenhouse . The second papermark to be adopted by this pioneer mill was the monogram WR , the initials of the principal founder , on one half of the sheet of paper , while on the other half appeared a clover leaf inside a shield surmounted by a crown . Underneath the shield , in outline letters , was the word " Pensilvania . " The shield-and-crown device displays a great deal of Dutch and French influence , as watermarks of this style had been used by early papermakers in Holland , adopted by them from France , where the device had been used as a papermark as early as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watermark . The crown and shield with three fleurs-de-lis constituted the arms of France , and this device was frequently used as a watermark by the papermakers of the Low Countries , probably in reference to the direct descent of the House of Burgundy from the kings of France . Papermarks of this character may be found in the paper used by William Caxton , the first printer in England , whose paper was procured from the Low Countries . No paper was produced in  | England until the establishment of the John Tate mill in Hertford about 1496 . The clover leaf , trefoil , or " klee-blatt , " which Rittenhouse substituted for the fleur-de-lis , was adapted from the townmark or seal of the village of Germantown , a settlement not far distant from the location of the paper mill . This seal or emblem had been in use by the community only a short time before Rittenhouse put it to use as a watermark . The next papermark to be adopted by this mill consisted simply of the letters KR , the initials of Claus Rittenhouse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being Klaas . With the use of this initial mark on the left half , the clover leaf was sometimes introduced on the right half of the t paper . The only other watermark known to have been used by this family of papermakers was the letters IR , the initials of Jacob Rittenhouse , a great-grandson of the founder of the mill . In 1710 William De Wees established the second paper mill in the colonies . This mill was really an outgrowth of the original Rittenhouse establishment . Apparently the De Wees owners did not make use of watermarks . It is recorded , however , that this mill manufactured " an imitation of asses-skin paper which was well executed . " In the year 1729 Thomas Willcox set up the third paper mill in the colony of Pennsylvania . This establishment used as a standard watermark a dove and olive-branch design with the initials of the papermaker ? first MM TMW for the founder , and in later years MW , the initials of Mark Willcox , the son , who was operating the mill in 1767 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mill being known as Ivy Mills on account of the English ivy that covered the stone buildings . The original vine was brought from England by Thomas Willcox to Pennsylvania in 1725 , from near the Old Ivy Bridge in Devonshire . This mill also used the familiar post-horn device as a watermark previous to 1787 . The many bank-note papers executed at Ivy Mills were mostly watermarked with the names and marks of states and banks . One of the earliest of these papermarks was made for Pennsylvania in the year 1777 . A letter of Revolutionary interest ( dated March 11 , 1778 ) concerning this  | watermark was written to Colonel Andrew Boyd , Sub-Lieutenant of Chester County , Pennsylvania , where the Willcox paper mill was located . This letter reads in part : " Mr. Willcox has in his possession a mould for making paper belonging to this state , which you are requested to bring away , it is marked with the word Pennsylvania ' in twenfy-four places , he did promise if the enemy came that way he would throw it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pennsylvania , used the dove and branch watermark certainly as early as 1789 , possibly from the establishment of this mill two years earlier . This mill in 1793 was using the word " Brandywine " as a watermark , as the Gilpin mill was situated on the Brandywine River . The dove and branch were a favourite watermark with American papermakers , for we find it used again in 1805 by Thomas Amies , the third mill to adopt this design as a trademark . The dove sometimes lacks the branch and is at times quite poorly drawn , but the identifying name is usually present , variously given as AMIES , AMIES PHILADA , etc . Amies was at one time superintendent of the Willcox mill at Chester , and after setting up his own establishment he adopted the dove and branch of Willcox origin as a watermark . A direct descendant of Thomas Willcox living in the old family home near Chester in 1925 had in his possession a pair of moulds that had been used in the old Ivy Mills , which bore the dove and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dove and branch watermark was used by Jackson and Sharpless as early as 1809 . This mill was located on Redstone Creek , Fayette County , Pennsylvania , and was the earliest papermaking establishment in western Pennsylvania . The watermarks used by the New England paper mills during their pioneer history have never been systematically recorded and it is doubtful if the emblems employed by these early establishments could be gathered together with any degree of accuracy . The several watermarks used by the William Parks paper mill established at Williamsburg , Virginia , in the eighteenth century have been well described and pictured in a pamphlet issued by the corporation . The fourth paper mill in Pennsylvania , established forty-six years after the original Rittenhouse project , was Die Papier Miihle der Bruderscha f t zu Ephrata , already mentioned . Ephrata was a  | communistic settlement made by a branch of the Pietists of Germany who emigrated to Pennsylvania in the early eighteenth centifry . The members of the community lived in a cloister or convent under monastic rules of celibacy and austerity . The community was self-sustaining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printing and bookbinding , as well as in a number of less pretentious crafts . Several of the buildings of the old cloisters are still standing and form one of the most interesting groups of early eighteenth-century construction in this country . The paper mill of the community at Ephrata was under the direction of the Funk Brothers , Samuel and Jacob , both experienced in the art of papermaking , having acquired the trade in Germany . The principal product of the mill was a coarse brown paper that they called " macalatur . " This paper was never watermarked , but the finer grades of printing and writing papers bore marks of identification . One of the Ephrata papermarks was a large figure four , the perfect number , below which were the initials RF , a private mark of the Funk family . The letters FB for Funk Briider also appear , without the figure four , in some A of the Ephrata publications . This mark may be studied in the paper used in the edition of Theosophische Lectionen , printed in 1745 . The most emblematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mystic books that they printed . This highly symbolic device consists of a Latin cross surmounted by a scroll with the word " ZION , " two keys forming triangles with the uprights and arms of a cross , which rested upon a narrow panel bearing the name " EFSATA . " The keys had reference to the Clavicula Salomonis , or Keys of Solomon , a mystic book of the seventeenth century which was highly regarded by the brotherhood . The entire emblem was capped by a filagree , not unlike the upper part of the second Rittenhouse watermark . The cross-and-keys device may be found in books printed at Ephrata before 1745 . Several other watermarks that were used by this mill were the crown , the post-horn , and perhaps a three-circle device which again shows the perfect figure four , so much favoured by the Brotherhood . In going through one of the dilapidated buildings at Ephrata many years ago , I found an old chest that had been  | hidden under a heap of discarded lumber . When this chest was opened , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet having eight pages of German text printed upon it ; the paper was unfolded , just as it had come from the press in the eighteenth century . It is believed that this paper is of European make , but it is possible that it was made at the Ephrata mill upon moulds brought from Germany . In this paper the three-circle and figure-four device appears , but it is not possible to identify it definitely as an Ephrata watermark . The printing , however , is authentically American . In the paper upon which early American books and newspapers were printed we find numerous watermarks , but it is an almost hopeless task to classify the marks and state precisely =N .. r ? what mills produced them . Papermaking moulds were brought to this country from all parts of Europe and it is probable that many of them had watermarking wires already attached . In this way foreign marks were introduced into American-made sheets of paper . As an example of the prejudice of the American public in the early nineteenth century regarding American-made paper the following amusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 , 1812 : " About seven years ago I witnessed a circumstance which afforded me a high gratification . I was in a book-store when a person came in and asked for a ream of letter paper . The bookseller shewed some of an excellent quality , with which the customer was fully satisfied , ? but asking the price , was led to suppose , from its cheapness , that it was American , and demanded if it was so ? On receiving an answer in the affirmative , he said it would not do ? he wanted English . " I have other paper , ' said the bookseller , for which I must have such and such a price , will you look at it , sir ? ' The price being high enough , the gentleman after much examination and comparison made his purchase , paid his money cheerfully , and carried his paper away . The two reams exhibited came from the same mill , and were taken out of the same bundle ! Large quantities of paper are made in the United States with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British , at least insinuated to be so and sold as such . I can see no harm in it , ? the quality is as good , and if the people will have preju-  | dices , let them pay for them ! We may laugh at this story and think the purchaser was a fool ? but , verily , many of us , though not so silly as to paper , are as great dunces in other things . It is not long since that certain manufacturers of dry goods to the Eastward were compelled to pack their commodities in British cases to insure their sale ! " This sarcastic disquisition was in all probability written by that crusty old American journalist himself , Hezekiah Niles ( 1777-1839 ) , as he enjoyed nothing better than to indulge in raillery and ridicule at the expense of others , especially those in high positions . In the issue of his Register , published at Baltimore , for August 5 , 1820 , he takes Congress to task for supplying its members with writing paper watermarked with the royal crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ... the paper is of a very fine quality , better , perhaps , than four-fifths of the members of Congress ever used , perhaps ever saw , before their arrival in Washington . " He continues in the same vein and suggests that the watermarks in Congressional paper convey more of the American spirit : " Let Congress use paper that is watermarked with a codfish , a hoe-cake , a yoke of oxen , or a race horse , ? anything but the royal crown of England . " Each of the watermarks ? whether the simple devices of the thirteenth century , the human figure and head , man 's works , vegetation , animals , or the devices of the early American papermakers ? appears to have had its place in the world of symbolism , but whether or not they meant anything , other than as marks of identification , is conjecture . It is reasonable to believe that they bore some significance and held some vital place in the lives of the craftsmen who fashioned them . For students of paper and papermaking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watermarks some object or utensil of their own calling . How interesting it would be to find a mould , a vat , or a paper press pictured as a watermark in a book page from the press of Gutenberg or Caxton ! But the old workers were accustomed to seeing and handling their own implements and probably regarded the tools of other crafts and walks of life as more curious and ingenious . Whatever the origin or use of the papermarks , the many thousands of devices that we have inherited from the early papermakers are so varied that they form almost an encyclopaedia of design , and illustrate a multitude of mediieval objects and uten-  | sils that otherwise might not have been recorded . Present-day workers in the paper industry may well be proud of the history and traditions of their trade , for no other craft of Europe can display such an endless array of designs extending over a period of almost seven hundred years .  | Latter-Day Watermarks THE NINETEENTH ? CENTURY DEVELOPMENT OF WATERMARKS INTO AN ARTISTIC AND TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENT THE BANK OF ENGLAND was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later , in 1758 , that its bank-notes were first forged . This original attempt at deception was in no way a skilled achievement where the perpetrator was versed in papermaking , watermarking , and engraving , but was the crude attempt of a Stafford linen draper , Richard William Vaughan , to change the figures of a note to a higher denomination . Vaughan was found guilty of the crime and was executed at Tyburn on the 11th of May 1758 . There were few who wished to emulate Vaughan , so for the following twenty years the counterfeiting of bank-notes was exceedingly rare . The next case of counterfeiting bank paper in England occurred in 1778 when John Mathieson , a native of Scotland , tried to manufacture spurious money duplicating that used by the Darlington Bank . Mathieson 's methods were far more skilful and ingenious than the rough and cumbersome attempts of Vaughan . Mathieson was versed in engraving , and while he did not actually make his own paper , he devised imitation watermarks in plain paper which went undetected for a considerable time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the authorities and they could not conceive how their notes could possibly be imitated . In Mathieson 's clever work the engraving was finely executed and the watermark , which the bankers had considered an infallible criterion , tallied so precisely with the original that no discrepancies could be detected . Several papermakers were of the opinion that the devices were genuine water-  | marks and had been placed in the paper in the usual manner during the process of forming the sheets , but Mathieson declared that this was not the case and claimed the marks were the result of a particular process known only to himself . After his apprehension he offered to explain the secret of his discovery provided the corporation would spare his life , but his proposal was rejected and his " secret " died with him.1 A watermark may be imitated by copying the design with a pointed stick dipped in the following preparations : spermaceti and linseed oil , equal parts , melted together in a water bath and then stirred until cold ; or equal quantities of turpentine and Canada balsam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by artists . If the required designs or symbols be well drawn they will have some resemblance to a genuine watermark , as the liquids , when dry , render the paper somewhat transparent . It is needless to say , of course , that all these manoeuvres are very easy to detect , since a false mark produced in this manner will fade completely when the paper is dipped in water , while an actual watermark when wet will become more brilliant and more discernible . Mathieson , the forger , no doubt resorted to an elementary process of this kind in his work and it is surprising that this simple method of creating artificial watermarks baffled the officials . In 1773 an act was passed making the penalty death for copying the watermark in English bank-note paper ; and to prevent imitation , it was enacted that no person should prepare any engraved bill or promissory note containing the words " Bank of England , " or " Bank post bill , " or expressing any sum in white letters on black ground in resemblance of " Bank paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notwithstanding all the precautions taken and the penalties enacted by the British Government after their first experiences with counterfeiters , there was much deceit practised . The next forger in the annals of the Bank of England was a man of rare skill as a designer , engraver , papermaker , and printer , and while his work was eventually detected , he evaded the authorities on every side . Charles Price , or " Old Patch " as he was called on account of a black cloth over one eye which he wore as a disguise , was one of those men whose whole abilities were employed  | in defrauding . His first efforts in counterfeiting were practised about the year 1780 and his false bank-notes were so skilfully engraved and the watermarks so perfectly executed that the Bank of England accepted his bank-notes without question , and they were discovered to be forgeries only after they had reached a particular department . Price carried on his unlawful work in Titchfield Street , London , and there had set up a small paper mill where he formed the sheets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into custody , and his end was worthy of his life : he employed his son to procure the necessary implements of destruction and was found hanging in his cell in Bridewell Prison.4 In September 1801 the following advertisement appeared : " All the one and two pound notes issued by the Bank of England , on and after the first of August will , to prevent forgeries , be printed on a peculiar and purposely constructed paper ; consequently those dated 31st July , or any subsequent day , will be impressed upon paper manufactured with waved or curved lines . " In the twenty years prior to 1817 there were no fewer than 870 prosecutions connected with bank-note forgery in Britain , three hundred persons being executed . In the Bank of England alone there were seventy clerks employed in detecting forged notes . The year 1818 was the culminating point of the crimes ; in the first three months of that year there were 128 prosecutions by the bank , and by the end of the year thirty-two individuals had been hanged for note forgery . From January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulated 131,331 pieces of forged bank paper . ' By 1818 there was great consternation among the Bank of England officials , as well as among merchants and tradesmen , at the extent to which forgers had carried their skill . The engraving and printing did not hinder the efforts of a man who wished to turn his ingenuity to such a purpose ; neither did the complications of papermaking and watermarking . The leading typographers and engravers of the day were engaged in trying to produce bank-notes that would not easily lend themselves to being imitated , and interest was aroused to such an extent that the Society of Arts attempted to supply remedies to counteract the spread of counterfeiting and published a report in 1819.6 No artisan laboured more diligently or more conscientiously than Sir William Congreve to arrive at some peculiar or technical  | complication in engraving or papermaking that would be a stumbling-block to even the most talented of forgers . While his plans were never adopted by the bank in their entirety , they were , nevertheless , of great importance and it was through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented and brought into existence at so early a date , for at the beginning of the nineteenth century watermarking in England had not reached any great degree of perfection . Sir William Congreve was born in Staffordshire in 1772 . He was a General of artillery in the English Army and was attached to the Royal Laboratory at Woolwich . Sir William was a man of remarkable inventive genius and is now best known for his development of the rocket as a military weapon and for his writings relative to warfare . He died in France in 1828 . Congreve 's first method of making coloured watermarks consisted in couching a thin layer of white paper and then laying another tinted sheet in the form of a design on the first wet sheet ; then another white sheet was couched over this , which made a triple sheet . After pressing and drying , these layers became a homogeneous piece of paper , and the middle coloured layer could only be perceived when the sheet was held to the light . The lettering or device in the second , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stencil placed over the mould , cut in the form of the required design . As many colours as desired were inserted between the two outside layers of moist paper , each colour being formed separately ( Figures 221 , 222 , 223 , 224 ) . In 1818 , the year in which counterfeiting had reached its height , Sir William endeavoured to have his triple paper adopted by the bank of England for their bank-notes . All of the experimental sheets of paper which he made to show the directors of the Bank , as well as his appeal to that institution to adopt his plan , were set down in a folio volume , the manuscript being in his own hand . This unique book " has been in my possession for a number of footnote * The volume measures 834 by 13 inches and contains 62 pages with 12 solid pages of manuscript in Sir William Congreve 's hand . Thirty-six specimens of watermarked bank-note paper made for or by Congreve are tipped in the book , each example having a description by the inventor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1818 and bears the name J. Rump . There is , of course , only the one copy of this volume and it forms a unique document in the evolution of papermaking and watermarking.  | years , and owing to its interesting nature the text is here reproduced verbatim : Account of the Origin and Experiments of the Triple Paper invented by Sir William Congreve and proposed for the new Bank-Note . The first suggestion of this paper was given by me to the Commission in a Memoir read to them on the 30th October 1818 . In a subsequent memoir dated the 11th December I stated some further particulars respecting this Paper and proposed extracting the colour partially in the interior layer of the Paper by means of acids . Experiments to this effect will be found in the annexed collection . On the 29th December I procured a quantity of Adrianople red cloth , which I was induced to consider the best colour for reasons that will be found to be stated at full length in the following Memoir addressed to the Bank and sent this cloth to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately to Freefolk and made his first report to me on the 7th February 1819 , after which a series of letters passed between us containing directions from me to him from time to time , and his observations on sending me back the results as per copies dated February 8th , 10th , 12th , 15th , 16th , 19th , and March 19th . With this cloth Mr. Brewer went through a regular series of experiinents under my direction . Specimens of which are here annexed with proper explanations . These experiments were at first all carried on by waking the triple Paper of three separate layers and three couchings . On the 12th of February I desired to have some with two layers only to be sent up that they might be printed on the interior layer and returned for another white layer , so that the printing would be in the heart of every sheet of paper . On the 19th of February it occurred to me that a good effect might be produced by leaving part of the interior bare so as to produce a coloured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genuineness of the triple Paper with the colour in the interior as is seen in the Memoir to the Bank . In these experiments with the red pulp a very curious effect was accidentally discovered by which the interior coloured layer is mottled . In the middle of April Mr. Portal endeavoured to produce an imitation of the triple Paper made on a small scale . A specimen is annexed and it will be seen how unsuccessful an attempt it was . He did not pretend that he was not obliged to go through all the process used by us in making regular triple Paper , or that it did not require Papermakers to fabricate it , for in fact he employed the same men that had carried on my experiments , the only difference was that it was done in smaller quantities and in truth that the effect in making it in smaller quantities  | is visible enough in the specimen of his imitation . ( Messrs . Portal have manufactured the bank-note paper for the Bank of England since 1725 . ) This imitation , however , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the security derivable from the triple Paper except by the regular process of Papermaking , was rather confirmed than shaken by this attempt of Mr. Portal , and it was subsequent to this that they recommended the adoption of this triple Paper to the Bank . But to proceed in detailing the course of the experiments , ? all the specimens hitherto produced were either without watermark , or with common wire watermark . I now conceived that a very superior watermark might be produced by a filigree pattern cut out in metal , and accordingly on this principle an oval watermark in silver was prepared by Mr. Branston . The great security of this description of watermark is that the lines of the pattern may cross in the most complicated scroll or cheque work which involves a difficulty in the imitation either by varnish or by cutting out the middle leaf . The next improvement which I suggested by letter to Mr. Portal of the 15th June was to attempt to make the triple Paper by three dippings and only one couching which I conceived would not only improve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expense in making the Paper by saving the operation of two couchings out of three in each sheet , and I accordingly prepared another watermark for the experiment . The result of this experiment fully justified my supposition and some specimens are attached in which I think the art of Papermaking for Bank-Notes is brought to the highest state of perfection . I caused another watermark also to be made which was used quite on a different principle to any hitherto adopted , it was not attached to the mould , but to the deckle and lifted off with it , so as to carry away with it all the pulp where the watermark is intended to appear . There are thirty-six specimens of paper affixed in the back of Congreve 's manuscript volume . The first twenty-four examples were fabricated by the original method of three dippings and three couchings . These are the identical sheets which were fashioned by Mr. Brewer for Sir William , and were made , as Congreve states in his explanation , " with common dye ; the paper thick and clumsy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made from Adrianople red cloth and the paper much finer . " There are also sheets of two colour combinations , made  | with white and yellow , and white and red pulp . Congreve shows one sheet in four colours , red , yellow , blue , and white . This particular sheet of bank-note paper was the most complex ever attempted up to that time , and although Sir William stated that " it is crude and rough , " the specimen has many good qualities ; and when it is considered that this sheet of paper was made in the infancy of coloured watermarking , it must be regarded as a remarkable specimen . Congreve also gives specimens of paper with printing on the interior of the sheet , giving the appearance of a watermark in black . This was accomplished by printing with common printers ' ink upon one leaf and then couching another leaf over the printed one . He also extracted the colour from the ink , leaving the lettering in white , resembling a genuine watermark made with wire . Of the attempt by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventor has this to say : " Mr. Portal 's imitation of the Adrianople red triple paper , the badness of which imitation will be evident by comparing it with one of the genuine Adrianople notes below it . " While Sir William 's specimen is a little more brilliant in colour than that of Mr. Portal , it would be unfair to suggest that the " imitation " was nearly so bad as Sir William would lead us to believe . In advocating the use of his triple paper in the making of banknotes , Sir William Congreve directed this letter to the officials of the Bank of England : TO THE GOVERNOR AND DIRECTORS OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND : ? As the triple Paper which I have had the honour to propose and superintend for the new Bank-note seems now to be brought very nearly to perfection , I think it is desirable that I should give as concise and summary a view as I can of the principal points of security which I have had in view , in proposing this plan , and as all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Directors of the Bank , I have thought it right to address this paper in particular to them . First then , as to the security arising from the mode of fabricating this paper . I feel confident that no imitation of this paper with the layer of coloured pulp thrown into the interior , can be made without going through the process of papermaking , and indeed this has never been denied . The imitations that were attempted were made as paper and by papermakers , and no man has ever been bold enough to say he can  | produce the effects here produced by any process subsequent to the original formation of the paper . This fact alone therefore , amounts to no ordinary security for most assuredly the forger can not as at present by various simple means take a piece of common paper and produce the appearance of a watermark upon it . He must , as I have already observed , absolutely go through the process of papermaking , and moreover to produce the extraordinary clear watermark thus given he must discover and pursue a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an expert papermaker , of dipping the three layers of pulp , one upon the other , without couching , and still further of making the coloured layer in clear water . I say , therefore , that as this new and extraordinary system of manipulation has been found essential to the production of the new watermark so peculiarly clear and transparent , there is no probability , for the present at all events , of its being imitated even by a papermaker . In the second place , as to the security arising from the introduction of colour . It is evident that the tint in the interior of the paper gives a brilliancy to the watermark which can not be obliterated by the wearing of the note , or by its being soiled , whereas in the present white note , after being considerably rubbed and soiled , it is extremely difficult to distinguish the watermark . Another very important advantage in the introduction of colour in the interior of the note is that it is a much greater security than the thinness of the present paper against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the making a ten pound out of a one or two pound note by erasure . This is a mode of forgery that has been practiced with the present paper , but with the coloured paper any erasure which would not show on colourless paper would produce a greater strength of colour by laying bare the interior . With regard to the particular colour , the pale blue as far as appearance goes seems to be the most preferred , there are , however , reasons which induce me to prefer the pink produced by the Adrianople red dye , and which I shall here state as this is a point resting with the Bank , and one which I think well worthy their mature consideration as independent of the general security attached to the introduction of colour , much of the security depends upon the use of this particular dye . The fact is that the pink pulp with which the first specimens were produced was of a very peculiar and remarkable tint that can only be obtained from the Adrianople red and is moreover a colour that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after it is made , but must actually have been given to the cloth previous to its being made into pulp . The least quantity of pulp that can be made at one time is one hundred weight .  | As therefore to obtain pulp of this colour so large a quantity must be made at once , it is evident that the true Adrianople pink pulp , which can always be distinguished from any other tint , can only be made in a regular paper mill on the largest scale . The Adrianople red cloth from which this pulp must be obtained is not produced in more than two or three principal manufactories in this country , as the process of dyeing it is a most laborious , troublesome , and uncertain operation consisting of nine or ten different manipulations . By adding this dye , therefore , the security arising from the paper appears to be completed , for the forger would not only then be obliged to make the paper , but to make it in large quantities . I must confess therefore , that I am of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tint , that this is a point which should be reconsidered and especially as the tint may be given in as light a shade as the blue , and as little detrimental to the effect of the printing . Test of the genuineness of this Paper : ? The most simple rule may he laid down for the test of the genuineness of the triple paper , namely that when held up to the light and looked through the colours will look much stronger than when looked at . Now , if the colour were not in the interior , which we have seen is a process too difficult for the ordinary forger to attempt in his paper , the very reverse would be the effect , that is , if the colour were stained on the surface which seems to be the only mode of imitation open to the forger , then would the colour look paler when looked through than when looked at , instead of looking stronger as in the genuine note . And to prove this difference to the Public on the note itself , a narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the note , in this border , therefore , the colour is superficial and accordingly when the note is held up to the light the border where the colour is superficial and which is the strongest tint when looked at , appears the palest when looked through , and vice versa , the remainder of the note , where the colour is in the interior and which appears the palest when looked at , is much the strongest tint when looked through . Thus the truth and value of this simple test are at once established on a first inspection . Of the expense : ? Mr. Brewer has informed me that it has been ascertained by experiments in the presence of Mr. Portal , that one man could on the last new plan of three dippings with only one couching make eight sheets of this new paper in ten minutes without any succession of moulds . The following is the calculation he founds upon this fact : 8 sheets in 10 minutes by one man ; 48 sheets in one hour ; 480 sheets in one day of ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 3840  | notes may be made in one day by one man and if 20 men are employed they would make 76,800 notes in a day , which is , I believe , considerably more than required . The Governor and Directors seriously considered the use of Sir William Congreve 's invention for their bank-notes and conducted a number of experiments regarding its probable use . It appears that Mr. Portal , whose firm had long since made all of the Bank of England paper , did not take kindly to Sir William 's new triple paper and dissuaded the bank officials from its adoption . Producing the triple paper would have involved great difficulties , and had the bank authorities and Mr. Portal seen fit to decide upon the new paper , its fabrication on so large a scale would have been a perplexing task for even the most adept of papermakers . Sir William Congreve was naturally disappointed when the bank officials finally refused to make use of his paper for banknotes , and in a communication addressed to the commission , dated September 11 , 1819 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of triple paper having been successfully accomplished , that is to say the cleanness and brilliancy of the watermark and the fitness of its texture for a bank-note having been brought to perfection , its adoption for that purpose having also been decided upon by the Commission , it was natural to suppose that time would have been given to realize the necessary arrangements for making it in sufficient quantity for the supply of the Bank . No preparations , therefore , or experiments were made for this object which was considered as the minor point until about a fortnight since , nor indeed was any opposition anticipated on this ground since the first objections stated were that the paper was too easily made , and not that it was too difficult . The event , however , has proved there was a want of due precaution and foresight in this want of preparation , for seeing the determined opposition that is made to it in every stage , arrangements for producing the supply ought certainly to have been made and proceeded hand in hand with the main operation of perfecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has only been produced in a perfect state with the two note moulds . This much , however , has been ascertained from the experiments that have been tried with the eight note mould , that it is the breadth of these moulds and not their length that prevents the man from throwing off the water as well from an eight note , as from a two note mould . Now , if the notes of the eight note  | mould were put crossways instead of lengthways , the eight note mould might be made a very little broader than the two note mould , and might therefore be used equally well in the production of the triple paper . I am , therefore , still convinced that the necessary quantity may thus be made with very little increase of means at Freefolk . I have no wish , however , to press the matter further on the Bank and Mr. Portal in defiance of such determined opposition on his part , if the Commission think fit to rescind their decision for its adoption . I have only to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ascertaining for my own satisfaction after having taken so much trouble how far the fabrication of this paper can be realized on the great scale and at what expense . Signed WILLIAM CONGREVE As Mr. John Portal figured so prominently in the controversy between the Bank of England officials and Sir William Congreve regarding the triple paper , it may be interesting to trace the history of his family and his record and experience as a papermaker . The Portals were a Huguenot family of Albigensian descent , their house , both ancient and noble , having long been associated with Toulouse . During the trouble under Louis XIV , Louis de Portal , then head of the family , attempted to escape , but he and his wife and one child were killed , and only the four other children managed to flee to Holland . One of these , Henri , attached himself to the court of William of Orange , and when the latter came over to England to supplant James II , he followed after a lapse of several years . Henri landed in Southampton in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stoneham , which belonged to the Governor and Company of White Papermakers in England . Here Henri de Portal mastered the many branches of papermaking . In 1711 , when he attained his majority , Henri de Portal was naturalized and became Henry Portal . When he started out for himself , Henry first had the Bare mill , near Whitechurch , but in 1718 he took over the neighbouring Laverstoke mill , which the family has held ever since . The original tenure was a ninetynine-year lease at five pounds and " one Reame of Fools-cap paper , neatly cut , " per annum . Under the lease he was required to rebuild the mill , which he did in 1719 . In 1725 Henry Portal secured the monopoly for making bank-note paper for the Bank of England . The bank-notes that were manufactured in England previous to  | Henry Portal 's contract were of plain paper , without watermarking . Those from the Laverstoke mill had a watermark border of a loop pattern running around the edges of the sheets , and ever since 1725 the Bank of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pryors , adjoining Laverstoke mill , in 1747 . He was succeeded by his son , Joseph Portal , who operated the mill until his death in 1793 . His son John Portal , continued the fabrication of the Bank of England notes for a period of fiftythree years , until his death in 1848 . The paper mill is still continued by the Portals ? a record of over two hundred years in the same family. ? It will be seen that John Portal , Sir William Congreve 's adversary , had come from a family of papermakers and that his own long experience qualified him to advise the Bank of England authorities regarding the adoption of Congreve 's triple paper . Sir William Congreve was forty-six years of age when he discovered that three separate sheets of paper could be formed and couched as one sheet , thus introducing colour into the interior of the paper . There is no record of his having made any other triple paper than that shown to the Governor and Directors of the Bank of England in 1818 , all of which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Congreve patented his invention on December 4 , 1819 . There was but little accomplished in the art of coloured watermarking from the time of Congreve until about 1885 when Mr. Lee of Wookey Hole , near Wells , Somerset , England , undertook to revive and improve the art . Clayton Beadle in his article on watermarking 8 gives Lee the credit of being the pioneer in England in the making of coloured watermarks , but this is obviously a mistake . Mr. Beadle also states that Lee patented his invention in 1886 , but a search through the British Patent Office records does not reveal a coloured-watermark patent under his name . As late as 1900 W. Fairweather and A. and G. B. Fornari were granted a patent in England which reads in part : " A sheet of white or coloured pulp , having any design suitable for a watermark , is inserted between two plain sheets of pulp , and the three layers are pressed together to form a single sheet of paper . The mould consists of a base over which is stretched the sieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the required de-  | sign cut in it . The watermark can only be seen by transmitted light . " From the advent of papermaking in the thirteenth century until Congreve 's invention there was practically no change in the method of impressing designs in paper during the process of fabrication . After the experiments undertaken by Congreve it became apparent to European papermakers that the art of watermarking need not be limited to line lettering and simple devices and emblems twisted in wire and applied to the surface of the moulds . Contemporary with Congreve working in England was Johannot carrying on the art of watermarking in France . This French papermaking firm did excellent work and today specimens of their papers are accepted as superior watermarking . With the Johannot watermarks the woven wire was pressed so the stock , or pulp , was held in two degrees of density or thickness , which formed backgrounds for the outline single wire portraits or emblems . This was the first instance of simple light-and-shade watermarking ; the Johannot mill was executing work of this kind as early as 1812 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Johannot establishment , whose origin dates at Ambert from the first part of the seven-  | teenth century , and whose plant was later moved to Annonay . Portrait watermarks were also made in Germany during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries , but the work is not comparable to that of Johannot . During the middle of the nineteenth century the art of watermarking was receiving considerable attention in America , especially at the Willcox mill in Pennsylvania . In Figure 227 is shown a watermarked treasury note paper made by this mill in 1843 ; in Figure 228 may be seen a fairly elaborate mark produced by Willcox in 1848 for the United States Government ; and in Figure 229 may be studied what is perhaps the first bank-note paper ever made in the United States for a foreign government . This watermarked paper was made by the Willcox mill for the Bank of Greece in 1859 . These three speci. mens from the Pennsylvania mill are superior to most of the watermarking done in America at this period .  | A decided change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century when William Henry Smith , an Englishman , conceived the plan for complicated light-and-shade watermarking . This departure from the old manner of using single wires and simple impressed backgrounds was received with acclaim as a genuine artistic development . The expense of manufacturing the moulds , however , was considerable from a commercial standpoint . With the Smith method of watermarking any degree of density or lightness could be made into the paper so when the sheet was held to the light the paper would reveal , through its various thicknesses , any object or form , no matter how intricate the shading . Watermarked reproductions of the paintings of the old ( nasters , as well as portraits of celebrities , were undertaken with surprisingly accurate and reasonably artistic results . In making a light-and-shade watermark by use of the Smith plan , the portrait or object is modelled with small cutting and gouging tools in a sheet of wax , against the light , the wax finally assuming the desired picture . Whatever appears in the wax will eventually take form as watermarks in the finished sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light-and-shade watermark is to procure a sheet of common window glass somewhat larger on all sides than the watermark to be modelled . A square-cut frame , or fence , is made around the edges of the glass with clay ; the melted wax is then poured upon the glass to a depth of about a quarter inch . A satisfactory composition for the wax can be made  | from a mixture of pure beeswax and common paraffin , about half and half . After the wax has hardened , the clay frame is removed , leaving the wax cut squarely around the edges upon the glass . The glass and its wax coating are now placed in a wooden frame holder , against the light , either natural or artificial , but with all light blocked out except directly behind the wax . With small gouging tools , which the modeller himself must make , the process of cutting the portrait or other object commences . It is only natural that the deeper the incisions in the wax , the more light will penetrate . The various degrees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papermaking fibres in these same thicknesses , thus causing any scale of light and shade . The cutting of a portrait in the wax can not be done hurriedly ; it requires the same skill that would be needed in the modelling of any sculpture . In making a watermark , however , there must be no under-  | cuts or sharp or abrupt edges , as these would interfere with the final pressing of the woven wire cloth . Only through practice will even an adept modeller be able to incise a wax satisfactorily for watermarking . In Europe , previous to the war , there were not over five or six workers who had perfected watermark modelling . After the wax has been incised ( Figure 230 ) , the surface of the wax is given a thorough coating of powdered graphite , or plumbago , which imparts a metallic surface to the wax . The graphite should be well rubbed into the crevices so that the wax re- p 300 ceives a complete surfacing . The next step is to make an electrotype of the wax ( Figure 231 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch in thickness , and to hold it rigid it is usually backed with about a quarter inch of lead , cut squarely on the four edges . The next procedure is to impart the contours of the electrotype to the woven brass wire gauze that will later form the face or surface of the papermaking mould . The woven wire should be of fine quality with from 48 to 60 wires to the inch . Where the portrait or design is to be impressed , the wire should be annealled . The wire screen may be impressed into the electrotyped object by the use of burnishing tools ; or if several moulds are to be made , a second electrotype should be made from the first , forming cameo and intaglio , more commonly known as male and female , dies . When two electrotypes have been made , the woven wire screen is pressed between them ; with this method any number of mould-covers can be made exactly alike in every detail  | ( Figures 232 , 233 ) . In Figures 234 , 236 , and 237 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper have been formed . In Figure 238 may be seen the watermark used by Elbert Hubbard from forty to fifty years ago , the first genuine light-andshade portrait watermark to be made for an American . This watermark was made from an etching of Mr. Hubbard by Otto J. Schneider , and the mould and paper were made in Italy by the well-known Fabriano firm of Pietro Miliani . In this instance four sheets were formed at each dipping of the mould , the sheets being divided by tearing wires , giving two genuine and two false deckles on every sheet of letter paper . In Figure 239 may be studied an elaborate English watermark made in 1874 to commemorate the four hundredth anniversary of the first printing in England , by William Caxton . This watermarked sheet of paper combines the single wire lines and the light-and-shade ; the paper is of a light-yellow colour and measures about 20 by 22 inches ; it was made by T. H. Saunders &; Company , London . The King Edward watermark ( Figure 240 ) was also made in England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 241 ) was  | of Italian make ; both watermarks measure approximately 13 by 16 inches . The watermarks of the Popes and St. Peter 's Cathedral were produced by the Fabriano firm , and the Cologne Cathedral is of German make ( Figures 242 ) . Perhaps the masterpiece of modern watermarking is the exquisite rendering of Raphael 's Madonna of the Chair , which was modelled in Italy , the paper made by the handmade-paper mill of Pietro Miliani , Fabriano ( Figure 243 ) , the size of the sheet about 15 by 1732 inches . As previously mentioned , the expense of light-and-shade portrait watermarks places them beyond the possibility of commercial exploitation . The mould for making a special portrait will cost from five hundred to over a thousand dollars , depending upon the size of the mould and the excellence of the modelling . After the moulds have been constructed , the cost of making paper upon them is not great , about thirty dollars the ream . A great many reams can be made upon a mould before it begins  | to break down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any number of mould-covers may be impressed ( Figure 244 ) . In the United States the making of light-and-shade watermarks has not been highly developed , but in Europe and japan watermarks made by the foregoing process have long played a prominent part in the prevention of counterfeiting . Light-and-shade watermarks may be successfully made on a hand-mould or on a cylinder-mould paper-machine , explained in a later section of this book ; but with the use of a " dandy-roll " the result is usually somewhat dull and lacking in contrast and brilliance . The paper for the  | currency of Japan is made in the Imperial mill , Tokyo , and is beautifully watermarked in the manner described . In the Western Hemisphere light-and-shade watermarks are used in the bank-note paper of Argentina , Chile , and Uruguay , all made in Europe . The following countries use bank-notes that bear light-and-shade watermarked portraits or other shaded emblems or devices : Algeria , Australia , Ceylon , Fiji , France , Germany , Great Britain , India , Indo-China , Iraq , Ireland , Italy , New Caledonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa , Straits Settlements , Turkey , and Yugoslavia . The paper for these bank-notes was made for the various governments in the mills of England , France , Germany , Italy , and Russia . During a recent visit in America , Dr. Leopoldo Marzano , technical director of the Banco d'Italia , Rome , called upon me and gave me interesting information relative to the use of watermarks in the paper money of the Italian Government . According to Dr. Marzano , it is much more difficult to counterfeit light-and-shade watermarks than for a forger to duplicate the engraving of a bank-  | note . If this assertion is correct , the counterfeiting of most European paper money would be a more highly skilled procedure than making spurious United States paper currency , which relies chiefly upon the intricate engraving to prevent falsification . In the entire history of counterfeiting there have been but few instances of actual papermaking ; practically all counterfeiting of United States money is done upon paper readily procurable in any stationery store . In regard to the use of fine watermarks or delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken into consideration that brilliantly watermarked paper , with its necessarily short fibre , does not possess the wearing quality  | of long-fibred paper that is not dependent upon watermarking . Strength and durability in paper must always be sacrificed to achieve clear-cut and distinct watermarks.  | Papermaking Materials WITH THE EIGHTEENTH ? CENTURY DEVELOPMENT OF PRINTING , OCCIDENTAL PAPERMAKERS WERE FORCED TO BEGIN THEIR SEARCH FOR VEGETABLE FIBRES NEVER BEFORE USED UNTIL the latter part of the eighteenth century practically all paper of Occidental origin had been made from linen or cotton rags or a mixture of these fibres . In using this superior material the papers made in Europe and America before about 1775 were , for the most part , of lasting and durable quality . ( Cotton has a cellulose content of about 91 per cent ; linen , hemp , jute , etc. , vary from about 60 to 90 per cent pure cellulose . ) During the first half of the eighteenth century there began an increased consumption of paper and it became more and more difficult for the papermakers to procure sufficient rags to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued for more general circulation , newspapers were established , and even popular magazines were beginning to make their weekly and monthly appearance . The sharp rise in the use of paper was unprecedented and in almost every periodical of the time , in both Europe and America , we find advertisements imploring the populace to " Save Your Rags . " One of the Massachusetts paper mills operating in 1799 considered the rag shortage so acute that it produced quantities of writing paper which bore the significant watermark : " SAVE RAGS . " Such paper was commonly sold and used in Boston during the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries . In an issue of the Boston News Letter , 1769 , there appeared an advertisement that " the bell cart will go through Boston about the end of each month to collect rags , " and added :  | Rags are as beauties which concealed lie , But when in paper , how it charms the eye ! Pray save your rags , new beauties to discover , For of paper , truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and press such knowledge is displayed As would n't exist if paper was not made . Wisdom of things , mysterious , divine , Illustriously doth on paper shine . The Massachusetts General Court in 1776 required the Committee of Safety in each locality to appoint a suitable person to receive rags , and appealed to the inhabitants to save even the most insignificant quantity . The Courier of Norwich , Connecticut , insisted that every man should say to his wife : " Molly , make a ragbag and hang it under the shelf where the big Bible lies " ; and the Boston Gazette , 1798 , urged that every child should be taught its " rag lesson . " The postmaster in Troy , New York , in 1801 , requested that the ladies of his state imitate the patriotism and frugality of the women of Massachusetts and Connecticut , who " display an elegant work-bag as part of the furniture of their parlours , in which every scrap of rag is carefully preserved for the papermakers . " Another advertisement showing the scarcity of rags during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 , 1777 issue of the North Carolina Gazette , which in facetious mood reads : " . . . when the young ladies are assured , that by sending to the paper mill an old handkerchief , no longer fit to cover their snowy breasts , there is a possibility of its returning to them again in the more pleasing form of a billet doux from their lovers , the proprietors flatter themselves with great success . " Perhaps the most instructive of the old " save rags " advertisements is found in the Cheshire Advertiser , Keene , New Hampshire , March 22 , 1792 . This advertisement reads : " Moses Johnson , informs all little misses , and others his customers , that he receives all kinds of cotton or linen rags , and flatters himself they will be encouraged to save them when they are informed 1% pounds of rags will buy a primer or a story book , or one yard of ribbon , two thimbles , two rings , twelve good needles , two strings of beads , one penknife , nine rows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of handsome buckles , or the famous History of Robinson Crusoe , ' who lived 28 years on an uninhabited island .... "  | In connection with the scarcity and use of paper in America an interesting story is told of two incidents that purport to have taken place during the Revolution . When the Continental Army entered Philadelphia , after the evacuation of the British , the soldiers encountered a scarcity of paper for wrapping their black powder and lead balls to be used as ammunition in their muskets . The soldiers made a search of the town for paper and fell upon a great store of the much-needed material in the attic of a house formerly occupied as a printing shop by Benjamin Franklin . The loot consisted of about 2,500 copies of a sermon compiled by the Reverend Gilbert Tenant which had been printed in Franklin 's establishment . The sermon , strangely enough , expounded the subject of Defensive War . The paper upon which the good minister 's sermons had been printed was at once converted into cartridges and put to use in the Battle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making of ammunition was in 1777 during the Battle of Brandywine , when Continental soldiers procured the necessary paper by the acquisition of a two-horse wagonload of an unbound edition of Foxe 's Book of Martyrs , which had just gone to the bindery in Ephrata , Pennsylvania . To encourage the use of wool and at the same time save linen and cotton for the papermakers , the English Parliament in 1666 decreed that only wool could be used in burying the dead . In one year approximately 200,000 pounds of linen and cotton were saved for the papermakers by this edict . In both England and Germany at this period it was contrary to good citizenship to make use of linen or cotton clothing for burial . All garments used for this purpose had to be made of wool , a material unsuited for papermaking . Linen and cotton have always been and will always remain the finest material for Occidental papermaking , but by the beginning of the nineteenth century the need for other more plentiful materials was keenly felt and the search had begun in earnest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about by a desire to discover more suitable or better materials for the purpose , but to find substances that were cheaper , more abundant , and more easily converted into paper ? the demand was for speed and low cost ; quality at this time was superseded by the necessity for quantity . The earliest suggestion of a papermaking material that might  | have been substituted for linen and cotton occurred in 1684 , when Edward Lloyd brought forth his impracticable plan of making paper from asbestos . Lloyd 's suggestion may be found in Philosophical Transactions , November and June , 1684-85 , pages 823-24 . The experiment as communicated to the learned society by Mr. Lloyd reads : An account of a sort of Paper made of Linum asbestinum found in Wales in a letter to the Publisher , from Edward Lloyd of Jesus Coll . Oxon . In obedience to your commands I have here sent you all the account I am able to give at present of the Lapis amianthus or Linum f ossile asbestinum which you were inform 'd ( and that truly ) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall choose to refer it to your own judgment to determine whether this be the same kind with the asbestos of the ancients , or in some respects different from it . . . . It is found in no small quantity in the Parish of LLan-Fair yng Hornwy in the northern part of Anglesey ; where it runs in veins through a rock of stone in hardness and colour not unlike flint . . . . It is composed of a lanuginous matter exactly resembling that of pappous plants . . . . Having pounded it and cleansed it , I brought it to the Paper-mil ; and putting it in water in a vessel just capacious enough to make Paper with such a quantity ; I stirred it pretty much , and desired the workmen to proceed with it in their usual method of making Paper , with their writingpaper mould : onely to stir it about ever before they put their mould in ; considering it as a far more ponderous substance than what they used ; and that consequently if not immediately taken up after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it proved but very course and to apt to tear , whereof I have sent you a sheet . But this being the first tryal , I have some reasons to believe it may be much improved ; nor did the workmen doubt but in case it were pounded in one of their mortars for 20 hours space it would make good writing-paper ; which , when I shall receive sufficient quantity of it , I design to try . In the mean while be pleased to accept of this superficial account of it , in token of gratitude from , your most oblig 'd servant E. Lloyd . The papermakers of Europe had been satisfied to make use of linen and cotton fibres for more than five and a half centuries , for it was not until 1716 that there appeared in England the first treatise on the use of a practical material other than linen and cotton for papermaking . This little volume , apparently the forerunner of a magazine , was entitled : Essays , for the Month of December 1716 ,  | to be continued Monthly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the People of England . The work was printed in London and the part regarding papermaking may be found in Essay VI . " The Society of Gentlemen " advanced the idea of using raw hemp without spinning or weaving as a material from which to fabricate paper , and a detailed description is given regarding its preparation for the purpose . The " Gentlemen " suggest also that paper mills be set up on barges or flat-bottomed boats on the Thames and the other navigable rivers of England , as they are on the Elbe and the Danube , the power to be furnished by the flux and reflux of the tide . There is an engraving in these Essays of 1716 depicting the manner in which hemp may be washed , boiled , pressed , and dried so that it can be put to use as a substitute for linen and cotton ; it is suggested that the paper-mill owners plant hemp in their mill yards and gardens and produce their own supply of papermaking material ( Figure 245 ) . The use of wood as a material from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Rene Antoine Ferchault de Reaumur ( 1683-1757 ) , a celebrated naturalist and physicist residing in France . Reaumur had observed the habits of the wasp ( Hymenopterous of the family Vespide ) and concluded that the  | wood filaments that were used by these insects to construct their nests so resembling paper could also be used in the actual process of papermaking ( Figure 246 ) . Reaumur 's observations regarding the habits of the wasp were laid before the French Royal Academy in a treatise dated November 15 , 1719 . Reaumur wrote : " The American wasps form very fine paper , like ours ; they extract the fibres of common wood of the countries where they live . They teach us that paper can be made from the fibres of plants without the use of rags and linen , and seem to invite us to try whether we can not make fine and good paper from the use of certain woods . If we had woods similar to those used by the American wasps for their paper , we could make the whitest paper , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and breaking of the fibres that the wasps make and using the thin paste that comes from them , a very fine paper may be composed . This study should not be neglected , for it is , I dare say , important . The rags from which we make our paper are not an economical material and every papermaker knows that this substance is becoming rare . While the consumption of paper increases every day , the production of linen remains about the same . In addition to this the foreign mills draw upon us for material . The wasp seems to teach us a means of overcoming these difficulties . " Reaumur further continued his observations regarding a heavier wasp-made paper : " But all of the wasps  | of the Kingdom that I know make nothing as singular as a species , I wasp that lives in Canada . . . . At first glance , and even after examining the surface for a considerable time , one would accept the nest as the work of the hand of man . Its covering resembles our paper to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has the same gloss , and the colour is that of an old piece of manufactured paper which had formerly been white . It is fine paper and as heavy as that of ordinary portfolios . " Reaumur 's most important observations relating to natural history may be found in Memoires pour servir a l'histoire des insectes , published in Amsterdam , six volumes , 1737-48 . The original intention of the author was to publish twelve volumes of this work , but he died during the process of compiling the seventh volume . Though there is no record of Reaumur 's ever having actually made paper from wood , he was , no doubt , the first scientist to suggest or recommend its use for this purpose . Human invention in the making of paper had been anticipated by the wasp , which insect may be considered as a professional papermaker , devoting most of her time and energies to the fabrication of this material , which she uses in the construction of nests . For this purpose the wasp seeks dry wood ? fence-rails and weather-beaten boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance she saws or rasps by mastication , mixes the macerated material with a natural size which is exuded for the purpose , and , working the whole into a paste , spreads the paper substance in a manner truly remarkable . The nest is usually a prolonged irregular spheroid , exceptionally light in weight , of a dark grey colour , and bound with repeated bands of paper to the bough from which it is suspended . The nest is water-resistant to a high degree , partly from the rounded top , but more from the fact that the paper strips of which it is composed overlap , like the shingles of a house , and from the fact that a semi-waterproof size is used in the composition . The community of papermaking wasps may amount to thirty thousand in a single season , according to Reaumur . It is interesting to note Reaumur 's condemnation of himself for having neglected to attempt any experiments on his own account in making paper from wood . In 1742 his comment was : " I am ashamed that I have not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I first realized its importance and made an announcement of it . But I had hoped
