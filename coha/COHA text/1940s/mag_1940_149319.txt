Revivals are as much a phenomenon of U. S. civilization as quilting bees or rail splitting . Georgia has been a revivalist stronghold ever since pioneer Evangelists John Wesley and George Whitefield saved souls there in the 1730s . But lately revivals have not done so well , even in Georgia . Few years ago famed Old Salem Campground , 32 miles southeast of At lanta , a scene of Methodist evangelistic meetings since 1828 , had to turn interdenominational to survive . Last week , as it wound up a rousing ten-day camp meeting , Salem seemed to have hit the sawdust trail for a comeback . <P> To Old Salem 's " tents " ( pre-Civil War frame shacks in which tenters sleep on straw-filled bunks ) went 300 campers , including many a family which has attended Salem camp meetings for generations , looks upon them as its annual vacation . On Sundays brick-red dust smoked up from the dirt road into Salem 's 65 acres as thousands more arrived to hear a thunder of evangelists , headed by a redheaded , blue-eyed , 81-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days began with reveille at 7 a.m. and a raising of the U. S. flag in front of the tabernacle . A " morning watch " from 7:30 to 8 was followed by breakfast , children 's classes at 9:30 , preaching service at 11 , lunch at noon , rest hour , afternoon service at 3 , a two-and-a-half-hour recreation period . After supper there followed a final service at 8 , taps at 10:30 . <P> Old Salem 's is a sociable gathering , with the air of a happy rural community . Placed shrewdly at a time in the Georgia farm calendar when it is too early to pick cotton or pull fodder , too late for plowing , the camp meeting gave Georgians a chance for chatting as well as churchgoing . Camp ers downed prodigious meals of fried chicken , country ham , barbecued beef , Brunswick stew , stuffed eggs , potato salad , corn on the cob , pie , watermelon , iced tea , lemonade , Coca-Cola . Even after such meals , old Dr. Bascom Anthony could stir his congregation . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called men to Christ . Nowadays he does much of his preaching and praying seated in an armchair , with his eyes shut , but the oldtime spirit is still there . Says he : " I like to think of the Lord standing right there . He 's there but we ca n't see Him-I like to think of Him saying to me , ' How are you going to represent Me , Son ? ' and I 'd say , ' Best I know how , Father . ' " <P> A homespun exhorter , Preacher Anthony told his hearers at Old Salem to rear their children in ways of work ( " If I had my way , I 'd not raise a boy in Georgia who had not looked at the south end of a mule going north " ) , urged honesty as the best policy ( " When you talk to God , tell Him the truth or keep your mouth shut " ) , livened his homilies with anecdote ( " Up in Johnson County , they named a girl Blasphemy and called her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prayers that sent " Amens " echoing round the tabernacle : <P> " Help us to be men enough not to stand for one minute these dictatorships who would overthrow all we believe in . Do n't let liberty perish from the earth . Do n't , Do n't , DO N'T allow freedom of conscience to vanish from the earth . "
