In two huge sheds , built by WPA on the polo field at Jackson Barracks , La. , 1,100 Army bakers went to work last week . They were baking a special , long-lasting Army bread , to be stocked up for the Army 's August-September maneuvers in Louisiana . <P> At its peak , the bakery will turn out 225,000 Ib. ( a day 's ration for 400.000 soldiers ) every 24 hours . The circular , thick-crusted loaves are about a foot in diameter , three inches thick , are supposed to remain edible for two weeks . A prized Quartermaster Corps recipe gets this effect by cutting down on water and yeast , giving the loaves a long , slow bake . The recipe ( for about 140 Ib. of bread ) : 100 Ib. of flour , 53 to 55 Ib. of water , 12 oz. of yeast , 2 Ib. of salt , 3 Ib. of sugar , 8 oz. of shortening.
