We are liable to do that now , because I am a member . " At the time Mr. Montgomery was arrested he was a property owner , married , a veteran of . the World War , with no previous police record . Mr. Montgomery 's attorney said an effort would be made to have the legislature vote an appropriation to compensate Mr. Montgomery for his years in prison , although this could not be done immediately since the state was planning an appeal .

" " Society can not suppress lawlessness by means of lawlessness in prosecution . Society can not inspire respect for law by withholding the protection of law from ! those accused of crime . It was and is the prosecuting attorney 's duty ' to assist in giving a fair trial to , the defendant . " After noting that someone identified with the prosecution had suppressed material evidence which , if it had been brought to the attention of the jury or the trial judge must have resulted in an acquittal , Judge Igoe said : " To condone the method Al evidence in this case is to invite grave injustice . There is one way to stop a practice that has become altogether too common and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public can scrutinize it and take such steps as are necessary to insure a true rendition of justice to all , regardless of race , creed or color .
