Deep in the heart of northern California 's majestic Siskiyou Mountains last week a little , freckle-faced , 109-lb. girl was doing a man-sized job for the U.S. war effort . Her name : Dorothea Reddy Moroney . Her business : mining chrome-essential in armor plate , shells and machine tools but now one of the scarcest metals in the U.S. <P> Dot got into the mining business through the front tunnel . Her father was a doctor who preferred mining to medicine , died leaving $23,000 debts and some dubious mining claims . So Dot went to work , first in a Seattle department store , then in San Francisco , then in Washington as a $30-a-week typist for the old NRA . In her spare time in the capitol she pawed through old mining records , finally traced her father 's claims . That got her started . In no time at all she located most of his mines , ousted claim-jumpers , sold one mine to Baltimore 's Rustless Iron &; Steel Corp . for $75,000 spot cash . <P> This deal won her the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chrome world was at her feet . So she spent her time nailing down an option on huge Alaskan chrome deposits , running up $700-monthly telephone bills , nightclubbing . Then she stormed Washington , surprised everybody but herself by landing the biggest chromite contract ever : $846,000 for 25,000 tons . Then came trouble . The Alaskan mine was under 30 feet of snow , could be mined only at terrific cost . Dot flopped on her contract , got back to her California mines with only $11 in her worn purse . <P> Now Dot is less regal but more productive . She uses a ramshackle , ghost-town U.S. post office as headquarters , tears between her three mountain mines in a secondhand $55 down-payment Ford , wears dirty trousers and wildly striped , tight-fitting sweaters ( see cut ) , bosses her 45 employes like a regular miner . She also produces chrome ore . Her Joe River mine turns out 20 tons every day . Last week she opened her Ladd mine , put more steam behind construction at the McGuffy mine . Thus her production soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,200 tons to the Government-20% more than the whole U.S. turned out in 1940.
