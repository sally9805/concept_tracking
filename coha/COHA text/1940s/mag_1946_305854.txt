ABRAHAM LINCOLN : His SPEECHES AND WRITINGS ( 843 pp. ) - Edifed by Roy P. Basler-World ( $3.75 ) . <P> Few U.S. Presidents have left much of a legacy to literature . The literary remains of Millard Fillmore or Benjamin Harrison , for instance , are scholar-carrion . Abraham Lincoln 's writings , in bright contrast , remain fresh and readable . <P> Perhaps the reason is , as Carl Sandburg suggests in a preface to this book , that Lincoln had a wide variety of styles-a greater range than any other U.S. statesman or orator . He wrote gravely and inspiringly at times , colloquially and waggishly at others . Now &; then , he even broke out into doggerel . Sample ( from something called The Bear Hunt ) : <P> When first my father settled here , <P> ' T was then the frontier line : <P> The panther 's scream , filled night with fear <P> And bears preyed on the swine . <P> Conscious Craftsman . The editor of this collection-which the publishers say is the first " comprehensive " Lincoln volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy P. Easier ( The Lincoln Legend , etc . ) . All told , Editor Easier has transcribed , wherever possible from the original sources , some 250 speeches , letters and literary odds &; ends . Many of the selections are obvious and familiar ( the classic Gettysburg and Second Inaugural addresses , etc. ) ; many are curious , little-known bits-such as Lincoln 's grateful testimonial to a corncutter : " Dr. Zachariehas operated on my feet with great success , and considerable addition to my comfort . " <P> Taking issue with those who consider Lincoln 's writing as an innocent or plain homespun talent , Editor Easier argues that it is the work of a conscious literary craftsman . Although he had little formal education , Lincoln studied rhetoric in his spare time , pored over Aesop 's Fables and the King James Bible , wrote practice exercises in prose and verse . By the time he had reached 28 , Easier declares , he had already acquired the skill " which marks all his later work . . . although his taste improves much thereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Steady Glow . Sometimes careless with grammar and punctuation , Lincoln was also unsure in his spelling. * Basler 's transcripts show him writing verry , immagine , inteligent , and even during his White House years inaugeral and colatterals . But , clearly enough , these failings did not affect the majestic music of the " House Divided " speech or the measured cadences of the 1862 Annual Message . <P> Somewhere deep inside Lincoln there was a kind of literary genius , as surely as there was in Edgar Allan Poe or Walt Whitman . It shines strong in his great state papers ; it glows steadily in his lesser efforts . It is as unmistakable as the man himself , in the letter the President wrote Jan. 26 , 1863 , to the Union Army 's Major General Joseph Hooker : <P> " I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac . . . . And yet I think it best for you to know that ... I am not quite satisfied with you . I believe you to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like . I also believe you do not mix politics with your profession , in which you are right .
