Jule and Joanna , peasant women , are gleaning in the field . They hear a weird howling from the forest-side . Rachael and Joel are seen approaching . Rachael is carrying a small package in her hand and there are signs of grief on her face . ( Curtains open . Jule and Joanna are gleaning in the field . Soft music , " Bringing in the Sheaves , " as they glean silently for one or two moments . Legion , who is back-stage , begins howling in many different tones of voice . Jule pauses and stares at Joanna in amazement . ) JULE ( Excitedly . ) What is that ? JOANNA I do n't know . It sounds like some kind of wild animal . JULE If it is anything that will harm us , where shall we go for safety ? JOANNA Verily , there is no place to hide unless we climb the sycamore tree or hide in one of those rock tombs . ( Howling continues . The women continue to work , but at irregular intervals , staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice it is . ) Enter RACHAEL weeping , carrying bread ; Joel follows , riding a stick for a horse . ( JULE and JOANNA speak almost simultaneously to RACHAEL . ) Do you hear that howling ? ( RACHAEL stares at the floor and then bursts into tears . JULE and JOANNA look at each other and then at RACHAEL in amazement ) p. 3 JULE What troubles thee , my friend ? JOANNA ( Rushing to her . ) May we do something for thee ? RACHAEL Nay . . . Nay . ( JOEL looks on in wonder . ) ( Howling continues . ) JOANNA Why weepest thou ? RACHAEL Didst thou not know that the voice which thou hearest over in the forest is that of my son ? ( Weeping . ) My own son ! JULE Your son ? RACHAEL Yes . ( Between sobs . ) He is possessed of many devils and he will not stay at home . He lives in caves and tombs . JOEL Yea , and we have tied him with chains but he breaks the chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the time he is in a rage . This is the way he does  --  ( JOEL then demonstrates in voice and bodily movements the actions of LEGION , his older brother , while the women watch him with pathetic interest . ) JULE ( To RACHAEL . ) What is that in thine hand ? JOEL ( Interrupts . ) That 's bread . She is going to put it  --  p. 4 RACHAEL ( Interrupts . ) Let me answer , Joel ! Hear thou me . See , the child will not eat at home and I have brought this crust of bread to lay on a stone so that in his wandering for food he will perchance find it and eat . ( Howling ; RACHAEL weeps . ) JOANNA There is a man in town whose name is Jesus . He has much power , so I hear , the power to raise the dead . ( RACHAEL looks with interest ; JOANNA continues . ) Did you ever take your son to see that man ? RACHAEL Nay ( sniffing ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed my way so that I might see him . JOANNA Thou shouldst invite him into thine home . If thou invite him he will come . And he will heal thy son . I know he can do it , because I have seen people whom he healed . He healed the Centurion 's servant . JULE Yea , and he raised the widow 's son from the dead . JOEL ( Quickly and with much interest . ) Thinketh thou that he can heal my brother ? JULE I know he can . JOEL Let 's find him , Mother , verily , he must be a great man . p. 5 RACHAEL ( Tearfully and prayerfully . ) My God , grant that I might find this man Jesus , that my child might be MADE WHOLE . ( Howling continues . ) How can I stand it  --  how can I , O God ! ( At this point JOANNA and JULE begin wiping their eyes also . ) ( Soft music while RACHAEL continues . ) O , Jehovah , give Peace to my heart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lay this bread here so that he may find it and eat . ( Exit RACHAEL and JOEL . ) ( JULE and JOANNA resume their work ; howling gets louder . ) JOANNA How sad it must be for a mother to carry such a burden . JULE Yea , that mournful groaning of her son must make her weep , because it haunts me , too . ( Enter LEGION , dressed in the manner of a tramp , crawling on his knees and making weird noises , his eyes staring before him . ) JOANNA ( Having just discovered LEGION . ) Look ! Look ! ( Both women stare in silence as LEGION approaches them . Suddenly , LEGION leaps at them . They fight at him and scream for help . Enter MICHAEL and EMMITT hurriedly , carrying chains with which to tie LEGION . While LEGION fights at them they tie his hands and feet . LEGION should be making weird noises all the while the scuffle is under way . The chains should have one cotton string link so as to be easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MICHAEL speaks ) p. 6 MICHAEL What is thy name ? ( LEGION groans loud and long . MICHAEL repeats . ) What is thy name ? ( LEGION jumps at him as he answers . ) LEGION My name is Legion ( RACHAEL and JOEL rush in and RACHAEL attempts to calm LEGION , while JOEL looks on in awe . ) MICHAEL Why doth thou call thyself Legion ? LEGION DEVILS  --  DEVILS  --  DEVILS  --  I KILL YOU ALL  --  ( LEGION leaps to his feet bursting the chains from his hands and feet . All other characters flee except RACHAEL . She tries to calm him . When she sees she can not , she bursts into tears while LEGION howls and squirms . Suddenly he looks with interest toward an exit . Then screams in a loud voice . ) I see Jesus , Jesus . Thou Son of David , what have I to do with thee ? ( Exits running . ) ( RACHAEL , amazed , follows slowly , even stopping at times . Before she has had time to get off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate hymn . RACHAEL shouts with waving arms in gratitude to the Master . All other characters reappear and join in the hymn . ) ( Curtain )
