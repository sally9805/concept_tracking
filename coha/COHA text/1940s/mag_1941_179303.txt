Instead of passing it , the House might just as well have torn up the tax bill and tossed the pieces away . When the bill reached the Senate last week , the Senate Finance Committee started tearing it up anyhow , writing it over from beginning to end . <P> Up before the committee came Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau , who stepped out of his constitutional mildness to speak a plain forthright mouthful about defense taxes . He asked for a new bill that would bring in from $800,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 more than the $3,206,200,000 the House bill would raise . Purpose : to build up public morale with " an all-out tax program , " head off inflation by cutting the public 's purchasing power . <P> Mr. Morgenthau wanted , among other things : 1 ) lower exemptions ( $750 for single taxpayers , $1,500 for married couples ) on incomes ; - 2 ) a stiffer excess-profits tax ; 3 ) mandatory joint returns for husbands &; wives ( which the House turned down ) with " appropriate relief " when both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler method of computing taxes ( from a table ) for small wage earners . <P> And Mr. Morgenthau wanted his new bill pronto . <P> Whether he will get it pronto is another matter . Sentiment in the Finance Committee seems to favor lowering exemptions , reviving mandatory joint returns . The Senate is resigned to a stiffer tax schedule than the House had stomach for . How big it will be , and where the money will come from , is anybody 's guess . <P> In any case , said Chairman George , the U.S. tax structure is due for a complete overhaul in 1942 . <P> <P> * The Gallup Poll was astonished to find that most citizens , though 80% do not pay income tax , are in favor of broadening the tax base . They would ask a family of four earning $ 1,000 , to pay $6 income tax ; would demand more than the present tax bill on incomes up to $10,000 , less than the present bill on incomes over $10,000 .
