The " cooperative plan , " used by landlords to unload hundreds of apartments on tenants at fat profits , last week turned up in the hotel business . Arnold Kirkeby , who has an eleven-hotel chain , announced a plan to turn Manhattan 's elegant , 492-room Hampshire House into a coop , and thereby make a pretty penny . Kirkeby 's company bought Hampshire House two years ago for $3,550,000 and later borrowed $3,350,000 on it . So far it has earned him less than $700,000 before taxes , which makes Kirkeby think " we are not making much headway . " <P> Under his plan , rooms and suites will be sold to the present tenants for anywhere from $5,100 for an unfurnished bedroom and kitchenette , studio style , to $39,000 for a three-bedroom suite with terrace . In addition , the purchasers will have to pay maintenance charges , to 150 Central Park South , Inc. , ranging from $1,404 to $10,374 a year . Kirkeby Operating Corp . will continue to run the hotel , its restaurants and bars . When owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suites to transients , turn over the money to the individual owners . <P> Title to the property will be held by a nonprofit co-op of stockholding tenants which will also take over the debts on the hotel . The new stockholders will pay Kirkeby $3,000,000 which " would take us many years to get through the present renting arrangement . " Having paid only $187,500 on the debts , Kirkeby 's company in effect will receive about 650% on its cash interest in the property . <P> The tenants , said Kirkeby , will be paying only $6,350,000 for a property which he insists could not be duplicated now for less than $14 million . And 32% of what the tenant pays in maintenance charges can be deducted for tax purposes-which Kirkeby feels " means something to tenants like , we will have . " More than half the present Hampshire House apartments have already been sold , said he , and the plan will go into effect on Jan. 1 .                   @ @
