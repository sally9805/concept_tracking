One hundred years ago this week , a Connecticut Yankee named Ureli Corelli Hill* launched the Philharmonic Society of New York . Impresario Hill , who looked something like a burlesque Irishman , could not find a second trumpet player . But with a dauntless lack of finesse the Philharmonic gave its first program in the gaslit Apollo Rooms on Lower Broadway : Beethoven 's Fifth ( V for Victory ) Symphony , Weber 's Oberon Overture and a Gargantuan assortment of operatic arias sung by a lady named Madame Otto . To finance his first season , Ureli Corelli Hill persuaded each man in the orchestra to chip in $25 . Profits , at the end of the season , were to be divided equally . When the time came , Ureli Corelli Hill learned what every other symphonic impresario has confirmed : that symphonic music is not a paying proposition . Each of the Philharmonic 's musicians got back $15 on his $25 investment . <P> In later seasons Ureli Corelli Hill bankrupted himself in the California gold rush , returned to borrow the Philharmonic 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At 70 he retired from music to take a flyer as a bit-part actor in legitimate drama . A disastrous venture in New Jersey real estate catapulted him back into Manhattan concert managing . In 1875 Ureli Corelli Hill took an overdose of morphine . Beside his body , police discovered a note . " Ha , ha ! " it read , " I go , the sooner the better ! " <P> This week the Philharmonic , under gangling , Dalmatian-born Artur Rodzinski , celebrated its 100th anniversary with Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony and Weber 's Oberon Overture , Ureli Corelli Hill would hardly have recognized his orchestra . Its budget had grown to $750,000 a year . Its chief conductors rated salaries of $50,000 a season and up . Oldest symphony orchestra in the U.S. , third oldest in the world , + the Philharmonic was now the patriarch of some 225 other U.S. orchestras . So stable a feature of Manhattan had the Philharmonic become that only twice in a century had its concerts been postponed : once on the death of Abraham Lincoln , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature would still be familiar to Ureli Corelli Hill : With an annual deficit of about $100,000 , the Philharmonic is still a losing proposition . <P> *Middle-named for famed Italian classical Composer Arcangelo Corelli ( 1653-1713 ) . <P> + London 's Royal Philharmonic is 129 years old , Vienna 's Philharmonic only 11 days older .
