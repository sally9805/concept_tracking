The 300 Republican women had completed the familiar rite of gathering to take a part in politics . They had driven to downtown Seattle from their homes on Capitol Hill and Magnolia Bluff , in Laurelhurst and suburban towns . They had spent a few seconds wondering if the gas was on at home . They had walked into the basement auditorium of the Masonic Temple , trilling greetings , eyeing other women 's hats and adjusting their own . They had eaten cold cuts and chicken salad , leaned back , and surreptitiously eased the heel straps of their shoes . A certain air of solidity had crept over them as they finished their coffee and eyed the speaker of the day . <P> Martha Taft , as they had suspected she would , looked unexcitingly like something out of Helen Hokinson . When she rose , a homey-looking woman in a purple suit and a blue maribou toque , they applauded vigorously enough , but it was dutiful applause ( after all , only the night before . Mrs. Taft and the Senator had been booed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed abruptly . A few minutes later the assembled ladies were not only applauding spontaneously but giving vent to that peculiar , breathless shriek with which U.S. women invariably express delight when gathered in groups of twelve or more . <P> High Old Time . By the time Martha Taft had spoken for ten minutes it was easy to understand why a Cleveland newspaper had headlined Ohio 's 1938 election news : BOB AND MARTHA TAFT ELECTED TO THE SENATE . Martha Taft had grown up amid the excitement of politics-her father , Lloyd Bowers , was Solicitor General under her husband 's father . She went to school at Rosemary Hall , Greenwich , Conn. , studied at the Sorbonne , danced as a debutante at White House balls and embassy parties in Washington . She met Bob Taft in 1910 , married him in 1914 . But as a wife and the mother of four sons she saw no reason for abandoning her interest in politics ( just as she saw no good reason for putting aside her passion for trout fishing ) . When her husband decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . <P> She was plainly a wise and experienced political campaigner in her own right . She was also , in contrast to her husband 's reserved and legalistic approach , graceful , friendly , bright , and capable of barbed epigram and pointed storytelling . She not only temporarily stole Bob Taft 's show ( he was talking to the Rotary Club to less applause at the moment ) , but made her audience like him better in the process . <P> As she talked about " Bob " or " my husband " it was clear that she was seeking applause for him , not herself , that she admired him tremendously , and was doing nothing more than paraphrasing his arguments . <P> Like her husband , Martha concentrated on defending the record of the 80th Congress-and the record of Bob Taft . She explained his contribution to the Taft-Hartley Act with warm pride : " My husband could have had a nice , peaceful job as chairman of the finance committee , but he took the labor committee . There were extremists on the right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
