EARLY childhood I have some stray imU ages , detached and undatable , called up occasionally for no reason , after the fashion of dreams . Indeed , sometimes I suspect that they may be fragments of old dreams , and not genuine recollections ; but in that case , where did the old dreams come from ? These images are all visual . I remember the seta de copes or knave of cups in the Spanish cards , with which I was playing on the floor , when I got entangled in my little frock , which bad a pattern of white and blue checks ; and I can see the corner of the room , our antesala , where I was crawling , and the nurse that helped me up . I also remember sitting in my mother 's lap , rather sleepy , and playing with a clasp that could run up and down the two strands of her long gold chain , made of flexible scales ; she wore a large lace collar , and had on a silk gown which she called el @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sprinkled with minute six-petaled flowers , each petal of a different color , white , green , yellow , brown , reel , and blue . Clothes and colors evidently had a great fascination for me : the emphasis may have been partly borrowed and verbal , because I heard the women constantly talking chiffons ; but the interest was congenial . I have always been attentive to clothes , and careful about my own ; and in those days of innocence , it was by no means indifferent to me whether with my white summer dress I wore the plain everyday blue sash , which I despised , or the glossy . and fresh silk tartan that made me feel more like myself . Another set of memories can be dated as not later than my third year , because they introduce my half-brother Robert , who left Avila when I was three and he was twelve . We occupied the same little room behind our mother 's and next to the schoolroom ; and I remember our pillow fights , or rather games , because Robert had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Re was forbidden to purloin any part . of my food , but might stick out his tongue in the hope , not always disappointed , that . with my fork I might delicately place a morsel upon it . It was a feat of equilibrium on my part , as well as of magnanimity , and I remember it for both reasons . Also the crisp potato omelet , fried in oil , that I had for supper , and that I still pine for and seldom obtain ; and the napkin , white on the black and red table cover , on which the feast was spread . The first toy I can remember was also in Robert 's time at Avila , for it was given me by his Alsatian tutor , Herr Schmidt : a velvety gray mouse that could be wound up to run across the floor . And finally I can remember distinctly the occasion of Robert 's departure . We all went to the station to see him off ; for my father was taking him as far as London , from where his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shapely calves ) was to convey him to America to be put to school . But it is not any emotion connected with leave-taking for an indefinite absence that remains in my mind : only the image of young Robert 's back , walking before me at a particular corner where we had to go in single file . He wore a long gray coat with a braided mantelette or short cape covering the shoulders ; above which I can still see his gray cap and the tightly curling brown hair escaping and bulging out under it . Whether I was actually walking too or was being carried does not appear from the picture . That Robert should have had an Alsatian tutor in Avila ( who also taught the girls ) may seem odd . It was one of those unstable and unsatisfactory compromises that were involved in the circumstances of my parents ' marriage . For a time they lived in Madrid , in the flat where I was born . But Madrid has a bad climate , with great heat in summer and cold winds in winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , and was expensive and , for my mother , socially distasteful . Moreover , she had to go back to Boston to her property and to the family of her first husband . My father knew it , but kept finding reasons for putting the thing off . Finally , very characteristically , my mother took the law into her own hands , secretly made all the arrangements , and one afternoon escaped with all of us , save my father , in the express train for Paris . There my father 's remonstrances reached her . They were so eloquent , or backed by such threats of action ( since he had a right at least to retain me ) , that we all finally returned . It had been agreed that we should live in Avila . But what education could Robert or the girls receive there ? None ! Therefore a private tutor was imperative , and somehow a young Alsatian was found who seemed to possess all the requirements . French and German were native languages for him , he spoke a little English and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his character apparently excellent . So Herr Schmidt was installed as a boarder with a poor widow who lived on the ground floor , and there were daily lessons in the sunny little room at the back of the house which became the schoolroom . I do n't know what idealistic cobwebs the German Minerva might have spun there had not her labors been interrupted ; but presently a German Cupid had flown in over the flowerpots in the open window , and tangled those learned threads . For although this was before the Franco-Prussian War , young Schmidt showed all the sentimentality and push of a pure Ger man ; he believed in discipline and thoroughness , and the duty of founding all instruction on German geography , in the native language ; so that between the difficult and most clearly articulated names of Harzgebirge and Riesengebirge he would whisper in Susana 's ear : " Je vous aime avec rage . " My half-sister was hardly sixteen , and he had to be sent away , which no doubt he thought a great injustice ; for he wrote a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his willingness to go to America and establish himself there ? on nothing a year . It was this collapse of superior international education at home that had made it urgent to send at least Robert at once to school in Amer. ica , and that separated me from my elder brother for the next five years . Two more years elapsed before my mother and sisters also departed . I remember nothing of that interval ; but after they went my uncle Santiago , with his wife Maria Josefa and his daughter Antonita , came to live with us . My aunt Maria Josefa was frankly a woman of the people . She was most at home in her kitchen , in a large blue apron that covered most of her skirt ; and I shall never forget the genuine fresh taste of the fried peppers and eggs , and the great soft cake or torta that came from her hands . She was a native of Jaen , with a strong but pleasant Andalusian accent and exaggerated rhetoric . Her every word was a diminutive or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrestrained litanies of sorrow or endearment . She could hardly read or write , and her simplicity or ha . mility was so great that she would casually oh . serve that her daughter Antoftita had been a side mesina or seven-months child ; from which anyone could gather the reason for her mar. riage . Not the person , tia Maria Josefa , in whose hands my mother could have wished to leave me at the age of five ! But my mother 's mind was made up and inflexible ; it was made up abstractly , in scorn of particulars and of consequences . She had put off her departure only too long , and now she must go . She seems to have trusted Maria Josefa as one might a devoted old nurse ; and this trust was deserved , because in relation to me Maria Josefa be . hayed perfectly . During the three years that I was separated from my mother I went more or less to school , It was a large darkish room on the ground floor in the public building directly opposite our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I had to go round the Ofiate tower into the lane at the back , where the school door was , We children stood in corros or circles round the teacher ? who was , I think , sometimes only an older lad ? and recited the lesson alter him . I do n't remember any individual clues . dons or answers , nor any reading or writing , vet we did learn somehow to read and write . 6 My first voyage ? if I had n't been deadly seasick ? might have initiated me into the life of primitive mariners , for we sailed the high seas in an open boat . It was a little freight steamer plying from Bilbao to Cardiff , hardly more than a tug ; and though it had a small bridge and a deckhouse aft , it was open to the sky forward , and visibly freighted with reddish earth , which I believed was iron ore . The Bay of Biscay confirmed its bad reputation ; but on the third day there were sunshine and smooth sparkling water , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in sight of the Welsh coast ; smooth grassy hillsides , gray-green in the slight mist and dotted with little white houses . But there was something far more interesting for me to watch : several boats with white sails , probably small yachts , bending and tacking in the almost imperceptible breeze . A British note ? a first hint to me of that brave , free , sporting side of the youthful Anglo-Saxon character which I was later to love so much . The next clay we traveled to Liverpool , where I remember nothing but the clocks , with long inclined ways , paved with cobblestones , leading down between great warehouses to the water 's edge . There we crept into a small rowboat that was to convey us to our ship . Several large vessels were riding at anchor in the stream ; my father pointed to the ugliest and most dwarfish of them and said that this would be ours . No help for it now , I reflected ; but at once my eye was attracted by a line of little flags running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two masts . What did that mean ? My father explained that dressing the ship in that fashion , although a British vessel , was a compliment courteously paid to the United States , because most of the passengers were Americans , who on that day were celebrating the anniversary of their Declaration of Independence . This incident has fixed the date of my first sailing to America unerringly in my mind : it was the Fourth of July , 187 . The Cunard steamship Samaria of that date was a vessel of 3000 tons , with a squat red smokestack between two stumpy masts , and a bowsprit like a sailing ship . Sails were indeed often set ? in order , it was said , to steady her , but probably also to help her along ; for never was a vessel more distinctly an old tub . She stood high , black , and short above the water , looking rusty and almost derelict ; however she bore us safely , if not steadily , to Boston in twelve days . The day of our arrival was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England summer ; there was naturally some confusion in landing , and everything seemed odd and unaccountable . It was a sordid scene . I saw no stone quays , such as I associated with ports , at Bilbao , at Portugalete , and lately on a grand scale at Liverpool . No docks ; only a wooden pier raised precariously on slimy piles , with the stained sea water running under it ; and on it a vast wooden shed , like a barn , filled with merchandise and strewn with rubbish . America was not yet rich , it was only growing rich ; people worked feverishly for quick returns , and let the future build for the future . But along came my brother Robert . I should n't have recognized him , nor he me , after those five years : a youth not yet eighteen , of middle height , with a narrow chest and sloping shoulders , and a straw hat with a bright blue ribbon ; yet the tightly curling brown hair , quite dry and brittle ( we both grew prematurely bald ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish , and very soon I was quite at home with him . But I had never seen a man in a straw hat before , and the blue ribbon did n't please me . Robert somehow guided us and dispatched our things to Beacon Street ; it was a complicated process and a complicated journey , a ferry and two horsecars , besides three short walks , but it was economical ? ten cents each for the trip , and twenty-five cents to send the trunk by express ; whereas a " hack " ( a hired landau ) would have cost five dollars . Events looked forward to with trepidation , when at length they occur , often fall flat . I was going to sec my mother and sisters again after three years ! Husband and wife were to be reunited ! Well , when Robert said , " This is our house , " and we walked up a little flight of stone steps to a half-open door in a row of doors , belonging to a narrow high house exactly like the house next to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others . It was the dead season , July 16 , and the whole street was deserted . However , before we got to the last step , a second door further in was opened ; we were expected ; there were faces peering out : Susana and Josefina in white dresses , and , much smaller , my mother wearing a cap and looking very grave . We kissed each other all round , and Susana cried . ( We had forgotten to kiss Robert at the wharf . ) Why did Susana cry ? Was it mere excitement , nerves ? Or was she already ? she was twenty-one ? secretly regretting Spain and her beaux jours ? They took us into the dining room to show us the " beautiful view " from the back of the house ? a great expanse of water , with a low line of nondescript sheds and wooden houses marking the opposite bank . It was Bostonian to show us the view first ; but we noticed that this dining room was hung with many oil paintings ? little Dutch or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantelpiece an old portrait : some Elizabethan worthy in a ruff and puffed sleeves , with a large ring on his fat forefinger . My father naturally had begun by examining these pictures ? all copies , of course ; and we learned that the Elizabethan gentleman was supposed to be Lord Burleigh , but that " Uncle Henry , " whose pictures these had been , had bought it because he thought the personage looked like a Sturgis and might have been one of his ancestors . My father must have been amused at this , it was so typical of the Sturgises . As for me , what interested me was to find the large sofa so soft when I sat on it . One might ride on the springs as if on horseback . It was inevitably Susana who took me in tow and who began to teach me English . I learned some verses by rote , about a bird 's nest , out of a brightly colored and highly moral book for young children . They ended , as I pronounced them , as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was not a young child , and if I had had an impulse to steal any bird 's nest or bird 's eggs , or even to climb any tree , it would not have been these nursery rhymes that could have dissuaded me . But I had no such impulse , and no such opportunity , which made this moralizing , like all moralizing , ring hollow in my ears . My pronunciation improved rapidly and unawares . I then had a good ear and a flexible tongue , and the fact that English was a foreign language to me positively helped me to learn it well and to speak it , for instance , much better than Susana or Robert , or most of the bars in my successive schools . The irregularity of English sounds and their subtlety was an interesting challenge : far from irritating , it attracted me , and made me sensitive to its fine shades ; so that even before I had heard an English voice or lived in England , my English was good . In 1887 , I met Lady Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after we had exchanged a few phrases , Lady Stanley said , " But how well you speak English ! " That is a backhanded compliment that one ordinarily prefers not to hear , since it implies that one evidently speaks like a foreigner . But in this case , as I was considered a Spaniard , it was not rude ; and I explained that I had been educated in Boston . " But you have n't an American accent , " the lady insisted . I reminded her of the culture of Boston , and protested that all my English was American , as I had been but three days in London . " No , " she admitted , " you have n't a London accent . You speak like Queen Victoria . " Let this stand as early testimony to my English speech : I spoke like Queen Victoria. , 7 Our house was , at that time , one of the last on the water-side of Beacon Street , and there was still many a vacant lot east of it , where on passing in sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat collar against the icy blast from the river ; as also , for the matter of that , at every cross-street . On the opposite side there were straggling groups of houses . Ours was one of two houses exactly alike ; yet as they were only two , we could distinguish ours without looking at the number displayed in large figures on the semicircular glass panel over the front door : for ours was the house to the left , not the one to the right . The pair were a product of that " producer 's economy , " then beginning to prevail in America , which first creates articles and then attempts to create a demand for them ? an economy that has flooded the country with breakfast foods , shaving soaps , poets , and professors of philosophy . Our twin houses had been designed to attract the buyer , who might sell his bargain again at a profit if he did n't find it satisfactory ; At my nicest , perhaps , but not always . And did n't Queen Victoria have a German accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was persuaded to buy her house , not expecting a financial crisis and a sudden but prolonged . disinclination on the part of the consumer to buy anything that he did n't need . The advantages in our house were in the first place social or snobbish : that it was in Beacon p Street and on the better or fashionable waterside of that street . It offered attractions also for the investor ; the town was rapidly spreading in that direction , land values were sure to go up , and the house would become every year more central and more desirable . Finally , it was a small house , with only two rooms on each of the principal floors : comfortable and cozy , therefore , for a rich spinster or for an ambitious young married couple ; especially as with its reception room and large dining room on the ground floor , and its front and back parlors upstairs , it lent itself to entertaining on a moderate scale . That it had only two decent bedrooms , one bathroom , and no backstairs , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to be a family of five , demanding five separate rooms . My mother therefore turned the front parlor into a bedroom for herself , while my sisters occupied the two good rooms on the second floor , and Robert , the cook , the house ' maid , and I had the four small cubicles in the mansard or French roof . At least , this was the ultimate and normal arrangement ; but when my father and I ar-rived , the family prejudice against doubling up had to be overcome for the time being . Not , however , in the case of my father and mother ; for she resigned the front parlor to him and moved to one of the rooms above , the two girls being crowded into the other , while I was tucked , as a waif new to the New World , not only into Robert 's room but into his bed , which happened incongruously to be a large double one . My mother had taken on her furniture from previous tenants or from " Aunt Lizzie " ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass out of sight into the upper regions ; one falling in this way to Robert 's lot . But this cohabitation with my elder brother did n't last long ; it was contrary to my mother 's instinct and habits ; and soon a small bed was provided for me and I was moved into the little room adjoining Robert 's , as into my own castle . To this unsuitable residence our habits adapted themselves as well as might be . The small room beside the front door became our family sitting room . It was sunny and cozy ; on cold evenings when the furnace proved insufficient , it could be at once warmed and ventilated by lighting the fire ; and by day it afforded us the feminine Spanish entertainment of looking out of the window and watching , a little below our own level , the stray passers-by . The back wall of our family sitting room was covered by a large bookcase with glass doors , which contained the eighth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica , Lane 's Arabian Nights , and a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few Spanish books and could get others from the Boston Public Library . In this way I read Oliver Optic 's stories for boys , doting on the seafaring and the oceanic geography ; also Abbott 's Lives , of which I remember Alexander the Great and Mary Queen of Scots . We also had Motley 's and Prescott 's pseudo-Spanish histories ; but I knew enough to spew them out of my mouth at the first tasting . During the first years Susana and Robert would read aloud to us in the evening , at first in Spanish : Don Quixote and Un ServilOn y un Liberalito by the pious lady-novelist " Fermin Caballero . " Then , because our interesting Spanish books were exhausted , or because Robert , especially , found English easier , they shifted to Shakespeare , and read Julius Caesar and Romeo and Juliet , of which I remember liking the first and thinking the second inexpressibly silly . There the practice died out . We had no more reading aloud , but Susana and I often read the same books separately . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in it , but failed . She liked nothing I showed her except Byron 's Don Juan , because , she said , it was as good as prose . The walls of this little sitting room were hung exclusively with engravings , most of which had adorned " Uncle Henry 's " house . There were official large portraits of Napoleon the Third and the Empress Eugenie in their regalia , theatrically posed and very pompous ; also an affecting scene in an English churchyard , full of yew and weeping willow , and showing a brave little boy and a sweet little girl , sitting and holding hands on the edge of a newly made grave , strewn with wild flowers , while above their heads a large white angel in muslin , the spirit of their departed mother , spread her hands and her great wings over them in protection and blessing . To take away the taste of this , like a savory after a milk pudding , there hung near it a framed collection of Poor Richard 's Proverbs , with quaint little eighteenth-century illustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , but can remember only Early to bed and early to rise , Makes a man healthy , wealthy , and wise and Three removes are as bad as a fire . I wished Franklin had said something crushingly true and materialistic about the Angel Mother and about Napoleon the Third 's corsets and waxed mustache ; but I was willing to nurse illusions about the Empress Eugenie . She had been the queen of fashion in her day , she was Spanish , and she might be said to look a little like Susana idealized. 8 Of Miss Welchman 's Kindergarten in Chestnut Street , my first school in Boston , I remember only that we had cards with holes pricked in them , and colored worsted that we were invited to pass through the holes , making designs to suit our own fancy . I suppose this was calculated to develop artistic originality , not to convince us how trivial that originality is , and how helpless without traditional models . I remember also that I used to walk home with another boy , not so old as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that one day ? this must have been in spring , for there was a bush with red flowers in his grass plot ? he said something very strange as he left me , and ran up the steps into his house . I reported what he had said to Susana , who pronounced it pantheism : perhaps it was that those red flowers were opening because God was awakening in them . This shows how far my English had got in that kindergarten and how we lisped metaphysics there . The Brimmer School , where I went during the next winter , 1873-1874 , was the public grammar school of our city district , although more than a mile from our house , in the depths of the South End . I had to walk the whole level length of Beacon Street , cross the Common , and go some distance downhill in Tremont Street to Common Street , where the school was situated , looking like a police station . It was a poor boys ' free school , the roughest I was ever in , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scenes , and where there was an atmosphere of rowdiness and requiring all sorts of minor punishments , such as standing in the corner or being detained after school . I do n't know what lessons we had , except that there were oral spelling-matches , in which naturally I did n't shine . A word spelled aloud ( as some Americans like to do facetiously , instead of pronouncing it ) still puzzles me and leaves me dumb . Nevertheless , partly because I was older and bigger than most of the boys , I soon became " monitor , " and had my little desk beside the teacher 's , a woman , facing the whole class . This distinction was invidious , and there were attempts at chasing me or hooting at me when we got out of school . By a happy chance it was possible to transfer me the next year to a much better school , the historic Latin School , where from the earliest times until my day , at least , all well-educated Bostonians had been prepared for college . The School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try an experiment and establish a preparatory course of two years , to precede the six traditional classes . The experiment was not long continued , but I profited by it , and passed eight full years in the Latin School , thus being more of a Latin School boy than almost anybody else . We were not lodged during those preliminary years in the regular schoolhouse , but at first in Harrison Avenue , and later in Mason Street . More than once in my life I have crossed a desert in all that regards myself , my thoughts , or my happiness ; so that when I look back over those years , I see objects , I see public events , I see persons and places , but I do n't see myself . My inner life , as I recall it , seems to be cor centrated in a few oases , in a few halting-places , Green Inns , or Sanctuaries , where the busy traveler stopped to rest , to think , and to he himself . I say the busy traveler , because those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feelings , later often with giving lectures and writing books ; yet all was done under some mechanical stimulus ? the college bell , the desk , the pen , or the chapter planned : old thoughts and old words flowing out duly from the reservoir , until the college bell rang again , and the water was turned of Of myself in those years I have no recollection ; it is as if I had n't existed , or only as a mechani. cal sensorium and active apparatus doing its work under my name . Such a period now scents to begin and to last for two thirds of my Latin School days . I remember my first headmaster at the Latin School , Mr. Gardner by name : a tall gaunt figure in some sort of flowing long coat , ? of course not a gown , ? with a diminutive head like the knob of a mannikin . The insignificant occiput was enlarged , however , as if by a halo , by a great crop of dusty brown hair . One clay on his rounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A headmaster has to pretend to know everything , and the pretense soon becomes a conviction . Mr. Gardner at once took over the duty of teaching us his super-French . " The French word bonne , " he said , " is pronounced in Paris ? I have been in Paris myself ? exactly as the English word bun . " Now , I had heard a good deal of French out of school . There had been the French bonne Justine , the Alsatian tutor who loved avec rage , and the Catholic families in Boston who chatted in French together . And had n't I inherited from my sisters La Jame Abeille du Parnasse Francais and could n't I say by heart : If bonne sounds exactly like bun , would Mr. Gardner maintain that couronne , save for that first letter , sounds exactly like you run ? I was as sure that it was as ridiculous to call a bonne a bun as to call a bun a bonne . But apparently headmasters were like that ; and I kept my phonetic science to myself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my teacher . I may add that at that time our French master was not a Frenchman , but a Yankee farmer named Mr. Capon , whom we called Old Cudjo , and who had a physiological method of imparting a Parisian accent ? there was no need to accompany the headmaster to Paris . He would open his mouth wide , like the hippopotamus at the zoo , and would insert a pencil , to point out exactly what parts of the tongue , lips , palate , or larynx we should contract or relax in order to emit the pure French sounds of u , an , en , in , un , and on . Nobody laughed . I think the boys were rather impressed for the moment by the depth of Mr. Capon 's science , and the hopelessness of profiting by it . He was not a man to be trifled with . He had a most thunderous way of playing what he called voluntaries on the piano ; and rumor had it that he had stolen a march , under a heavy handicap of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son was engaged to . Scraps of rude , quaint , grotesque humanity : bits of that Dickensian bohemia still surviving in my day in certain old-fashioned places . But the image that for me sets the key to them all appeared when we moved to the Bedford Street schoolhouse . It seemed a vast , rattling old shell of a building , bare , shabby , and forlorn to the point of squalor ; not exactly dirty , but worn , shaky , and stained deeply in every part by time , weather , and merciless usage . It had been built in a hurry , and not to last long . No blackboard was black ; all were indelibly clouded with ingrained layers of old chalk ; the more you rubbed it out , the more you rubbed it in . Every desk was stained with generations of ink spots , cut deeply with initials and scratched drawings . What idle thoughts had been wandering for years through all those empty heads in all those tedious school hours ! Even in the best schools , almost all schooltime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticks fast ; for the rest the boys are merely given time to grow and are kept from too much mischief . And the teachers , though it is not possible for me now to distinguish them all in memory , were surely not out of keeping with their surroundings : disappointed , shabby-genteel , picturesque old Yankees , with a little bitter humor breaking through their constitutional fatigue . I dare say that for them as for me the school was a familiar symbol of fatality . They had n't chosen it , they had n't wanted it , they did n't particularly like it ; they knew no reason why it should be the sort of school it was ; but there it stood , there they somehow found themselves entangled ; and there was nothing else practicable but to go on there , doing what was expected and imposed upon them . Those teachers were stray individuals ; they had not yet been standardized by educational departments and pedagogy . Some were like village schoolmasters or drudges ? elderly men , like Mr. Capen , with crotchets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to keep order , and neither lax nor cruel . Others , especially Mr. Fiske , afterwards headmaster , and Mr. Groce were younger , with a more modern education . I was an unprofitable though not unappreciative pupil to Mr. Fiske , because I did n't learn my Greek properly . That was not his fault . If I could have had him for a private tutor I should have become a good Grecian : it would have added immensely to my life and to my philosophy . But I was only one of forty ; I was expected to study dryly , mechanically , without the side-lights and the stimulus of non-verbal interest attached to the words . In Latin , I could supply these side-lights and nonverbal interests out of my own store . Latin was the language of the Church , it was old Spanish . The roots were all my roots . But Greek roots were more often foreign and at first unmeaning . I learned and remembered well what I could learn from Mr. Fiske without studying . Very different was dapper Mr. Groce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little plump man , with a keen , dry , cheerful , yet irritable disposition , a sparkling birdlike eye , and a little black mustache and diminutive chin-beard . I suspect that he was too intelligent to put up patiently with all the conventions . Had he not been a public-school teacher , dependent on the democratic hypocrisies of a government committee , he might have said unconventional things . This inner rebellion kept him from being sentimental , moralistic , or religious in respect to poetry ; yet he understood perfectly the penumbra of emotion that good and bad poetry alike may drag after them in an untrained mind . He knew how to rescue the structural and rational beauties of a poem from that bog of private feeling . To me this was a timely lesson , for it was precisely sadness and religiosity and grandiloquence that first attracted me in poetry ; and perhaps I owe to Mr. Groce the beginnings of a capacity to distinguish the musical and expressive charm of poetry from its moral appeal . At any rate , at sixteen , I composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Childe Harold and Adonais , full of pessimistic , languid , Byronic sentiments , describing the various kinds of superiority that Night has over Day . It got the prize . My lachrymose prize poem about the beauties of darkness was not my only effusion . The habit of scribbling mocking epigrams has accompanied me through life and invaded the margins of my most serious authors . Mockery is the first puerile form of . wit , playing with surfaces without sympathy : I abounded in it . During the winter of 1880-1881 our class , then the second class , formed a society to meet once a week in the evening and have a debate . We hired a bare room in Tremont Street , opposite the Common , with a few benches or chairs in it ; someone would propose a resolution or advance an opinion , and the discussion would follow . When my turn came , I read a little satire on all our teachers , in verse , saying very much what I have said about them here ; only that my account was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly . It had a great success , and the boys wanted to have it printed . Printed it was , but not as it originally stood . " Holy Moses , " for instance , which was the nickname current for our headmaster , Moses Merrill , was changed to the less irreverent and more exact phrase , " lordly Moses , " and many other things were modified . Then the whole was enveloped in a tirade , of a sentimental sort , about the Bedford Street schoolhouse , which was about to be abandoned for a new building in the South End . A lot of copies were printed , perhaps two or three hundred ; and on the day of our public Farewell Declamation in the Hall , the headmaster somehow got wind of its existence , and said " We hear that one of the boys has written a poem about leaving this old schoolhouse : will he get up and read it . " I had a copy in my pocket : I got up , and read the longish sentimental part and then sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment all was well ; but other boys and some outsiders got copies ; and the disrespectful gibes at the teachers became public under their noses . When school met again , Mr. Merrill made us a long speech ; but nothing more happened , and official sentiment towards me was not unfavorably affected . My class had to elect the lieutenant colonel of the Boston School Regiment , the colonel that year coming from the English High School ; and by a majority of one vote they elected Dick Smith , and then one unanimously for major of our battalion . But the headmaster reversed the order , and appointed inc lieutenant colonel and Dick Smith major , without giving reasons ; at which legal but arbitrary exhibition of favoritism on the headmaster 's part , Dick Smith 's father took him out of the school and I became both lieutenant colonel and major , both offices being almost sinecures.
