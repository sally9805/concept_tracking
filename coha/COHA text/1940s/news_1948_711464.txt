txt The high cost of travel Is bringing a shift from air and rail to the highways . Rail travel is off about 10% from last year . Airlines have felt a 3% dip . But inter-city bus lines are holding their own and passenger car touring is taking a bigger and bigger bite out of the nationwide travel market . There 's no agency like the Interstate Commerce Commission which regulates trains and buses , or the Civil Aeronautics Board which keeps tabs on the airlines , to check up on just how much auto traveling is going on . But countrywide reports on bridge and tunnel tolls as well as gasoline sales indicate more people are riding from here to there in automobiles . No one can put his finger on statistics but there may also be increased business travel by car as well as people just getting away from it alL Railroad Woes " We 've got to blame the motorist . " says an official of the Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines in commenting on a 25% drop from the 1947 level in his road 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad passenger traffic slump . for it operates a short haul from Philadelphia to the New Jersey coast resorts . But its report is echoed in varying degrees by rail operators in the mid-west and on the west coast . Some blame buses for siphoning away their normal tourist traffic . Here are some significant auto travel figures : The Delaware River Bridge , main artery between Philadelphia and New Jersey shore pleasure spots . set a new high in tolls in July , with an 8.8% gain over July of last year . Manhattan 's tunnels , parkways and bridges collected 3Te to 16% more in tolls during the first half of 1943 than in the corresponding period of 1947 . And in Detroit , home of the motor car , 20% more people crossed the Ambassador Bridge to Canada during July than a year ago that time . Higher travel costs is the explanation most often given for the shift from plane and sleeper to family jalopy . " The dollar pinch is the reason I took my family by automobile on our trip to Chicago this year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social visit to the midwestern metropolis every couple of years . He is a man of fairly comfortable means with what may be regarded as a typical family : A wife , a son of 13 and a 10-year-old daughter . Here 's what it cost this family for their transportation to the Windy City : " Gas " and oil . $14 ; tolls , $10 ; total : $24 one way . If they 'd gone by air , the tariff for the four would have been $175.49 . Traveling by Pullman , using lower berths , the cost would have been $131.94 ; by day coach ( sitting up all night ) , $109.90 ; and by bus . $54.74 . " I 'd have to figure about two and a half cents a mile for insurance and depreciation on the car , or another $21.12 , to be strictly accurate , " says this businessman , " but most of that expense would be piling up anyway if we 'd stayed home . " " As for room and meals , " he continues , " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider that part of our vacation fun , not just transportation . Even including the meal cost . our own car is cheaper than any other way of traveling except bus . There are meals to pay for on trains , too , you know , plus transportation to and from the railroad stations . What 's more , I can load up the car with all the family paraphernalia . " Rail , air and bus people claim they have one strike against them already in the 15% federal tax on transportation tariffs . That levy did n't exist before the war . And , travel officials stress , the family man buying tickets does n't care whether it 's the government or the transportation company which gets the added 15% , so long as he has to pay . Subtracting the war-born tax , air , train and bus rates do n't show up so badly among the spiraling cost of living . Compared to the 20 's Rail travel east of the Mississippi costs today an average of- about 40% more before tax than in 1940-50% more for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the over-all increase is about 20% . The carriers insist today 's basic fares ( the latest hike was in mid-July ) are just about what people used to pay back in the ' 20 's . Basic airline fares are about the same as in 1940 , but the 10% round trip discount and the 15% travel card discount ( for businessmen ) have disappeared . Inter-city bus fares are about 1942 levels , though the 15% tax , makes them seem much larger . The best way , perhaps , to see how different forms of travel hit your pocketbook. is to list comparative costs for a trip between the same points . How much would It cost a family of three full fares and one half fare to go from New York to Boston , New York to Chicago , and New York to Los Angeles . and back again , using the various means of transportation ? Here 's a breakdown of the cost by auto , plane , Pullman , day coach and bus : ( The 15% tax is included in the totals . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorists . ) There 's no exact yard-stick , but the best guess of oil companies and automobile travel experts . is that somewhere around 550 billion to 600 billion passenger miles ( one passenger mile : One person riding one mile ) a year are piled up in private car travel . That includes auto travel within a city . This compzrlys with about 6 billion passenger miles annually in planes . 12 billion in Pullmans. 25 billion in day coaches and another 20 billion in buses . 50 Billion Passenger Miles A 10% increase in auto travel  --  and that is what many travel people predict this year ? would add a staggering 50 billion passenger miles annually to that form of transportation . " Suppose only 10% of this increase  --  or 1% of the entire annual auto travel  --  was diverted from railroads and airplanes , " says one airline operator wh- has seen his indus -- growth come to a standstill this year . " That would be 5 billion passenger miles or more annually , nearly as much as we all do in one year and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured by airplanes and pullman cars . " There 's no way of knowing exactly how much autos have eaten into air and rail travel but there 's been considerable diversion , thinks this transportation expert . Railroadmen arc inclined to agree , though there are bright spots in their travel picture here and there . For instance . the Atchison . Topeka a. : Santa Fe 's July passenger business is up somewhat over last year , thanks to the line s new streamliner . " The Texas Chief . " Crack trains get a heavy play on almost all the roads . The Illinois Central reports better business this summer due to an unexpected boom in Florida-bound traffic . This line 's coach volume was up 15%. its Pullman reservations 10% over a year ago during July . But the nationwide rail travel outlook is far from optimistic . A spokesman for the Pullman Co , which operates the first class cars for the carriers , admits a dip in summer Pullman travel : " Folks lust are n't traveling this summer . " he says , blaming food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't figure the increase in railroad fares has much to do with the rail dump . Revenue Up , Volume Down . The huge Pennsylvania Railroad system estimates its July passenger revenue was up a shade over last year . but that actual volume of traffic was off . The revenue Increase was ' accounted for by fare boosts during the past 12 months . - Vacation travel by rail to eastern inland and mountain resorts has held its own this summer , better than traffic to seashore points . Both the Pere Marquette and the Canadian government-owned Grand Trunk lines . covering a wide midwest sector , report a decline in summer travel . Buses are doing better than railroads this summer , though even here the private car has apparently taken a nick into the volume of traffic . California officials report about 8% more people entering their state so far this year by bus than last year . The big Greyhound system running out of Chicago comes up with a report of materially increased July business . This company credits its gain at least partly to higher rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand . has felt a 6% dip in its summer volume . A spokesman says family motoring is to blame . Greyhound in San Francisco reports a 2% drop in July . The airlines have begun to feel the pinch especially in the last six weeks . Accidents ? particularly the one near Mt . Carmel , Pa .. in June  --  may have hurt some . Whatever the cause . July air traffic was disappointing throughout the country . That 's why airline bigwigs are meeting in Washington this week to talk over ways and means of improving their situation . - We 've priced ourselves out of the market , " says the head of one medium-sized airline . But other operators are asking for still another fare increase  --  they 've already had two 10% fare hikes within the past 18 months .
