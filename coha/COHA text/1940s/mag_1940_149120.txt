" Why did you start that fire ? " asked Dr. John P. Shea of a number of mountaineers . Among the answers : <P> " Kill snakes . " <P> " Burn out the ticks . " <P> " Get shet of the boll weevils . " <P> Dr. Shea did not believe them . A U. S. Forest Service official , he had been puzzled by large numbers of fires destroying timber from Louisiana to Virginia . Half of all U. S. forest fires occur in the South . Convinced that nine-tenths of them ( nearly 60,000 ) were started on purpose , he launched an inquiry in the field of social psychology . He found a " typical area " of 440,000 acres in the southernmost spur of the Blue Ridge Mountains inhabited by 1,800 families . The forest people there admitted starting fires , but the reasons they gave were evasive or absurd . <P> Last week Science Service reported Dr. Shea 's conclusion that the real incentive was boredom . The fires were exciting-especially when fire fighters arrived . <P> The woodland firebugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . But they have almost nothing in the way of diversion . Southern stocks of game and fish are dwindling ; hillbillies have no money for movies . So the men whittle , talk , sit-or start fires . <P> Socio-psychologist Shea suggested a complicated cure . Since hillbillies do not like recreations foisted on them by outside do-gooders , he would persuade community leaders to build their own recreation centres , with movies , dancing , shooting ranges , horseshoe-pitching grounds , pine sticks for whittling , brass cuspidors.
