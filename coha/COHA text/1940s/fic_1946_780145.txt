 | turnip with its tail in air . The side porch overlooked a tree-shade I lawn enclosed by a low cast-iron fence whose uprights were arrow- , and there was a break in the fence on the street front to let the graveled drive come out . At the back end of the drive , behind the house , stood a stable , also reddish-brown . To this house Grandmother Charles had come as a bride eighty years before . But nobody would have recognized it for the house it had been then  --  rectangular and white and plain-faced . A fash ionable Median architect had done it over twenty years previous , hanging on the porch with its red tin dome , adding the bay windows and the kitchen ell , and changing the old barn into the stable . To commemorate this transformation , he had set a concrete stepping block out on the curb beside the iron horse-headed hitching post . On the stepping block was carved , " 1892 . " ( It was soon afterward that Mrs. Littleton had added the porch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " ) The children never went in at the front doors . These were double doors ; the narrow pane in each was frosted over except for a wreath in the center , and they opened only for a coffin . Virginia and Benjamin walked around the porch and up the side steps to the side door that stood open . They knocked on the screen , but did not wait for anybody to let them in . They walked right in , calling , " Aunt Rowena ! " And Aunt Rowena came walking swiftly from one direction , and Aunt Lucy came walking swiftly from the other , and kissed them and hugged them and held them off to be looked at . Aunt Rowena and Aunt Lucy had a wet way of kissing . When Virginia had been younger , she had always held up her mouth like an angel , but had sometimes taken the opportunity to bite her great-aunts in the hope of discouraging future kissing . At the age of eight , however , she was more polite , and only wiped her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy were n't looking . Inside , that house was like a sealed chamber , with thick gaudy Brussels carpets on the floor , and heavy lace curtains and long looped-back plush draperies at all the windows ; and the inside shutters were always closed in the front parlor . The foot fell soundlessly . Not a sound of life from Jackson Avenue penetrated . On the walls the big engravings of classical subjects had an air of staring neurotically into space . And when you sank down in a tufted velvet chair , with enormous tassels hanging down from the front of its arms , it was as if it had swallowed you . There was an inhuman neatness about the whole place . It was as sumptuous yet neat as a funeral parlor . It was cold , too . On the hottest day , the  | chill never left those rooms . The marble tops on all the tables were cold to touch . And to stand at the open side door , and feel the outer summer warmth pouring in upon you was by contrast the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only doll in the house lay in the lower drawer of a marble-topped bureau in an unused bedroom . It had a muslin body stuffed with sawdust , and only its little white stockings and little black slippers and its hands and head were made of china . The whiteness of the china was very white . The pinkness of the doll 's cheeks , the blueness of its eyes , and the blackness of its cropped china hair were very pink and blue and black . It had on a long black velvet basque , buttoned down the front with jet buttons , and a full skirt of dark plaid taffeta that reached its ankles . Its name was Carrie , and it had belonged to Great-aunt Edith . Great-grandfather Charles had brought it to her all the way from Cincinnati once . So now of course nobody could play with it . Carrie lay in the lower drawer , a dead doll in her coffin . The books in the library were all dead books , old-fashioned novels that had belonged to Grandmother Charles : Thelma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearth , Thaddeus of Warsaw , The Bride of Lammermoor , in fine print on yellowing coarse paper , with orange spots like tea stains on the pages . There was nothing to do but read and eat . But the children read everything in sight , including the back numbers of the Saturday Evening Post which lay stacked at the foot of the back stairs . The aunts considered the Saturday Evening Post rather immoral . But the uncles liked it ; and it injected a modern lively note into the general atmosphere , with its covers by Lyondecker and Norman Rockwell , and its pictures of toothsome girls by James Montgomery Flagg , and its love stories by George Barr McCutcheon . As for eating , the children ate at intervals all day long . There were always nuts or apples or candy sitting around . And Aunt Rowena kept two cooky jars on the bottom shelf of the pantry safe , two cylindrical sand-colored stone jars with tin lids . One had sugar cookies in it , and the other had molasses cookies in it . A strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the door to the bottom shelves , and mingled with the kerosene smell of the Daisy Fly Killers which sat on all the kitchen window sills . That loud and mingled smell would rouse the dead . If Virginia could smell it now , Aunt Rowena would come walking swiftly and kiss her wetly , but oh , how welcomely . When the children were not eating , they were chewing gum .  | Uncle Douglas gave them a sly look , fished with two fingers in his lower vest pocket , and brought forth a whole package for them . He grinned when he saw how they fell upon it ; for he knew that Ettie regarded gum chewing as a low and vulgar habit , and that they never had chewing gum at home . Oh , the crackle of the pink wrapper ! Oh , the heavenly smell of spearmint ! Oh , the first delicious gush of juice from that thin powdery oblong ! Virginia was also very fond of Aunt Rowena 's chicken soup . Once when she had had a feverish cold , Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malingered when she was visiting the Charleses ' . " I think a little chicken soup might make me feel a little better , " she would hint delicately . And Aunt Rowena would smile , and Albert , the colored coachman-yardman , would go and buy a chicken , and that night at supper Virginia would sit and sip her chicken soup , an invalid who after all might be expected to recover . But once , when she had languorously disposed herself upon a sofa with a cushion under her head and had assumed a sweet and suffering expression , Aunt Rowena , instead of bringing soup , had brought the camphor bottle . " Throw back your head and just take a good snuff , " said Aunt Rowena . Virginia did , and the camphor ran up her nose . She thought the whole interior of her head was scalded . She coughed , she sneezed , the tears poured from her eyes . And thenceforward , whenever she began to catch cold at the Charleses ' , and it was camphor and not chicken soup which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But altogether she was extraordinarily well behaved when she was there and her mother was not . She and Benjamin hobnobbed peaceably . And yet , in spite of her good behavior , she was aware that all the Charleses but Uncle Marmion liked Benjamin better than they liked her . Uncle Marmion delighted in Virginia because she was a slender little girl , with pale brown skin , a freckled delicate snub nose , and those long dark eyes ; and her bobbed light brown hair lay smoothly on her small head and turned up at the ends like the wings of a Dutch cap ; and her stiff hair ribbon , tied to her scalp lock , stood upright like an enormous butterfly ; and there was in all an unnatural finish to her appearance . No matter what she was doing , she always looked as if she were just about to have her picture taken . Uncle Marmion said that Virginia would have plenty of beaux on the string when she grew up . " That child 's going to be a heartbreaker , " he always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome piratical face when he said it . For he had been the beau of all the belles in  | town , and regarded himself as an authority on heartbreakers . He , too , looked forward to the time when Virginia should shine as the fair princess of Median high society . But with the other Charleses , Benjamin was the favorite . He was somehow more human . There was a touching vulnerability about him , and a transparency , and what you saw inside him you could n't help respecting , although he was so bookish , and like a little old man in some ways . He was no longer serene and radiant ; and the sadness in this change was what stood out about him ? that , and a kind of desperate decency , as if he meant to do the right thing , come hell or high water . It is very wearing to be the enlargement and the vindication of your mother . Most people felt for Virginia the distrust of a robin for cuckoo 's egg or of a Christian for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin and airy detachment from all that is warm and pitiful and humanly shared . She was so slender and delicate and immaculate , so well behaved in general ( although her mother never thought so ) , so sly about her misbehavior , so opaque , so impervious to ordinary wounds , saying only what she should say , exhibiting only acceptable emotions , and very little of those , that all her relatives could n't help asking themselves what frightful depths this impeccable surface concealed . And their suspiciousness had not the effect of making Virginia warmer or more candid . It was her eyes that bothered them most . When she talked , her eyes were very wide open till some reply caused her to glance sidewise and take counsel of an invisible inaudible advisor . Then all animation died out of her . She sat there listening , like a witch , to something which spoke just over her shoulder . At such times her eyes grew long and dark and very sly . What were those soundless conversations ? Her relatives would never know . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had buried a bone . Then , behind their backs , when she thought they were off their guard , they would find her watching them with the attention of a spy . One of her least ingratiating traits was that she always made people , even grown people , feel that they had to put their best foot foremost . Just the same , her aunt Rowena was very fond of her . And with Aunt Rowena there was so much available affection that invidious comparisons between Virginia and Benjamin lost their sting ; so that Virginia loved her more than she loved her uncle Marmion . She was avid of admiration , but she was grateful from the bottom of her heart for love , not demonstrative , as with her grandmother , not capricious , as with her grandmother also ,  | disciplinarian , yes , and even rather bloodless , as was almost sure to be the case with anybody as old as Aunt Rowena , but steady . Aunt Rowena and Aunt Lucy were spare spry old ladies who dressed almost alike , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character that her everyday wrappers were always gray and always had high starched collars . It was a part of Aunt Lucy 's character that hers were always cinnamon brown and always had round flat collars . When they both bought black plush coats , one winter , these were identical . But Aunt Rowena 's black hats were always toques , and she always wore a veil ; whereas Aunt Lucy 's black hats always had narrow brims , and she never wore a veil . There was supposedly always a colored woman in the Charleses ' kitchen . But Aunt Rowena and Aunt Lucy were so persnickety in their ideas of cleanliness , and the uncles were so decided in their preferences in food , that the African temperament collapsed under the strain . " The help " left for a funeral or a deathbed , and never came back ; so that Aunt Rowena did the cooking as often as not , and Aunt Lucy did the cleaning . Albert fared better than the kitchen help because he had a room to himself over the stable . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rowena and Aunt Lucy made even his life miserable by periodically mounting the ladder-like stairs to his room , and turning up his mattress , and inspecting his blankets , and swabbing out the whole place with a loud-smelling bug killer . " I declaiah ! " Albert would say to one of the uncles , grinning and shaking his head . " Miss Rowena and Miss Lucy done stink me out agin ! " They took a mischievous pride in doing their own housework . Whenever another colored woman left , they acted as if it were a good joke . Then Aunt Lucy brazenly washed the windows , an old woman sagging backward over a second-story window sill , with a shabby black jacket over her wrapper , and her gray head tied up in a knitted fascinator , in full sight of all Jackson Avenue . Shc felt that you had to have a lot of money to be able to afford to wash your own windows on Jackson Avenue ; and she considered that she had it . This viewpoint was plainly Kuntz and Pennsylvania Dutch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact " the girls ' " inability to keep help and Lucy 's windowwashing exhibitions made " the boys " ashamed , and they scolded their sisters , though to no avail . Both Rowena and Lucy took after their mother , not only in their natures , but also in their pale goose  | eyes , their severity of expression , and that thick nose ending in a fleshy drop . Aunt Rowena 's severity , however , had a way of breaking up into smiles . She had the sweetest brightest smile Virginia had ever seen . It suddenly made her charming . As a girl she had gone for a ' while to Campbell College which later became the university on University Avenue . But her college education and also her engagement to the bright young theological student had been cut short by tuberculosis . She had recovered from the tuberculosis , but not till after she had undertaken the care of her mother ; so that she had never married and had never graduated from Campbell . Grandmother Charles had been able to remember the Rappite colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Robert Owen later took it over and made it famous as New Harmony . For many of the Rappites , finding themselves in a region of rich farmland which was going for a song , took an aversion to communism and soon dispersed . Among these were the Sackets , and the Sackets , too , were of French descent . Grandmother Charles 's father had been a Sacket . Her mother had been the Kuntz , " as Dutch as kraut . " Four of Grandmother Charles 's first five children , including a pair of twins , died in infancy . Anna  --  Nannie  --  was the only one of this batch to survive . And because Grandmother Charles had named all five of them Bible names , she decided to insure the lives of any other children she might have by calling them after the names of characters in profane works . She was a great reader , and especially admired the poems and novels of Sir Walter Scott ; so that her other children  --  and she had eight more  --  were named Guy Mannering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitz James , and Marmion . And every one of them lived , at least to grow up . Nannie , Guy Mannering , and Edith married . The others were engaged to be married at one time or another , but somehow their engagements all fell through . After their father died , it became an understood thing that they had to stay at home , the girls to look after their mother , the boys to look after her finances . For soon after her husband 's death , Grandmother Charles became an invalid . She seemed to be healthy . She was a big pale woman with heavy bones and heavy bland features , and those strange pale glassy eyes like goose eyes , and that thick nose ending in a fleshy drop . She had a hearty appetite and a lively mind . But she sat in her rocking chair all day long , reading novels , and Rowena and  | Lucy were needed to help her from her chair to her bed every night , and from bed to chair every morning , and from chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her everything she wanted . Virginia could remember Grandmother Charles . On the marbletopped table beside her chair had stood a stemmed glass bowl , with a glass cover , which Uncle Douglas kept filled with red and white striped peppermints . As she sat reading , she continually dipped into the peppermints , and sucked them with enjoyment , rolling them around in her mouth . But she hardly ever offered Virginia any , and Virginia never dared to help herself . Grandmother Charles 's possessiveness about the peppermints was like a child 's : You did n't dare to help yourself to another child 's candy ; it was only grown people 's that did n't matter to its owners so much . Aunt Rowena had fetched and carried and borne the greater share of her mother 's helplessness . She had also taken the brunt of family quarrels and the responsibility of business stratagem with such apparent willingness that the others had let her go ahead , never thinking to help her . What desperation when she had been younger , what wrestlings with herself , this voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is safe to say that these had not been small . Aunt Rowena had not given her family a weak soft soul . She had given them the soul of Grandmother Charles , not easily tamed , not yielding by nature , but dominating to a sinister degree when left to work for itself . Her capacity for self-subordination was as characteristically German as the driving egotism it subordinated . And precisely because her self was therefore a valuable gift , and generously given , Aunt Rowena was the sister and the aunt whom all the others loved . Only Aunt Lucy was jealous of her sister and sometimes spiteful to her . Aunt Lucy remembered that she , too , had broken her engagement  --  to a young man who , now in his old age , had done very well in the wholesale drug business . She , too , had stayed at home and helped take care of her mother . But she did n't get any credit . She did n't understand that if Aunt Rowena had been looking for credit , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a price demanded , but comes unasked and even unexpected , if it comes at all , it is indeed a rarity . And so Aunt Lucy got none . Even Ettie sometimes said in genuine affection , " Oh , Aunt Rowena 's a hoss ! " For every year , from the time she was six until she married , Ettie had spent her summers in Kentucky and Virginia with her grandfather Littleton . And since her own family could not provide her with suitable clothes , Aunt Rowena had  | come to her rescue . Aunt Lucy had helped , sporadically and as the spirit moved her . But Aunt Rowena had been the one who had sat steadily at the sewing machine , sometimes taking turns with the dressmaker , but sometimes doing it all herself , till Ettie 's summer outfit was complete . And Ettie , who wore her clothes well and loved to look smart , and had been bound and determined to " hold her end up " among her Kentucky cousins , still reminisced to Virginia and Benjamin about those dresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer Cousin Laura was married , " she would say . " It was tan pongee with a Zouave jacket , and trimmed with white insertion with black velvet baby ribbon run through it . Mercy ! There was yards and yards of black velvet baby ribbon on that dress . With it I wore a big Leghorn hat trimmed with big black velvet bows . " Or else she would say , " I had a pale blue organdy that summer , with a yellow silk underbody . I remember Laura had a pink one something like it . But then she always had so many pretty clothes ! And Bett always took such good care of our organdies , Laura 's and mine . " Bett had been Cousin Laura 's black woman . " She used to put a bowl of starch water on the ironing board , and sponge and sponge and press and press . When she got through , you could n't a ' told ' em from bran splinter new . " For fourteen years , till Ettie began to teach school and provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creations like these . It was only Aunt Rowena , of all the females in the Charles family and in the Littleton family , too , who was apparently exempt from that sogginess , that teariness , that was like the hereditary disease of hemophilia : you had only to touch a female Charles or Littleton a little roughly to make her bleed tears . Aunt Rowena spoke severely of this ailment . Maybe her severity resulted from her struggles to subdue it in herself . She called it " the Sacket snots , " and connected it with those light blue glassy eyes . She had been pleased when Virginia had turned out to have brown eyes . " We do n't want any more of your nasty goose-eyed babies , " she had said to Ettie , who was as goose-eyed as her grandmother and her aunts . And Benjamin 's only faults , in Aunt Rowena 's estimation , were his light blue eyes and his tendency to weep easily . " Now ! None of that ! " she would say when his chin began to quiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no more of the Sacket snots in this family ! " The Sacket snots seemed to be one symptom of a family emotionalism bordering on hysterics which Aunt Rowena had good  | reason to fear . Her sister Edith , the other sister who had married , had been its prime exponent as a girl . Edith had been the one who was always put upon , who never had what the others had , who was always slighted and overlooked , always flying into tantrums or locking herself in the parlor to sulk . Even as a girl herself Aunt Rowena was the one the others depended on to deal with Edith . And one day , after a scene in which Rowena spoke sharply and Edith burst into sobs and lamentations , as Rowena knelt before the oven , taking out a pan of rolls , Edith came up behind her and tried to push her into the oven  --  the act of a crazy person , no less . On the under sides of Aunt Rowena 's wrists were two white scars , even yet , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove . And then who could tell how she felt about her mother ? Did she have a fearful intimation that her mother 's invalidism had been the sincere shamming of dementia ; and that her own devotion had been offered.up to a cruel old bully ? Aunt Rowena must have been a brave woman when she subdued the Sacket snots within herself . True , she was not exempt from the superstition which had caused Grandmother Charles to insure the lives of her last eight children by naming them out of the works of Scott , and to attribute every human misfortune to the vengeance of God . Did Grandmother Charles read in the paper about a tornado ? The inhabitants of Kansas had better mend their ways . Did the painter fall off the stable roof and stave in his anklebones ? Well , Grandmother Charles had heard him out there , talking to Albert , cursing and swearing a blue streak . And it was Aunt Rowena who had given Ettie that print of Hoffmann 's " Christ Child " so that its prenatal influence might make Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coarseness of the Pennsylvania Dutch . " The Sacket snots " was not a very refined expression . Aunt Rowena was exceedingly refined . She was so refined that she always said " autumn roses " instead of " asters . " Her refinement , that is , was a sort of inverted coarseness . Coarseness tickled her , and she was sometimes wickedly and deliberately coarse . She had no other kind of sense of humor . And in the same style Uncle Douglas was a famous raconteur . At Shriners ' dinners and political powwows , his story of the sow in the swill barrel , for men only , was a masterpiece of its kind . The mystery of generation hides its face . Still it is undeniable that somehow or other Virginia and Benjamin had not only recognizable Littleton traits but a good broad streak of Charles as well . So had Ettie . Overemotionalism  --  there it was . Superstition  --  if to  | be convinced that you are the special object of incomprehensible malevolence or beneficence is the heart and soul of superstition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for coarseness , Ettie , like Aunt Rowena , prided herself upon her great refinement , only more so , since Aunt Rowena was no Littleton . Nevertheless , in the bosom of her family , it seemed to give her great relief to dwell upon the dirtier details of any ailment she might have . " No wonder I was nearly crazy with that tooth ! " she would say . " It had a yellow pus sac at the root as big as a grain of corn ! " Or else she would say , belching with a sort of monstrous satisfaction , " I do n't know why I ate that cabbage ; it always bloats me so ! " After a meal she also had a way of picking her teeth with a hairpin fished out of her hair , sitting as she read the paper , clicking the hairpin against her teeth , sucking it with an energetic audible relish which was very repulsive . At such times Amos and the children felt deep shame . There was a little man , a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very gentle , very correct , the only man in church who wore a cutaway coat and striped trousers . He often spoke in meeting , reciting a Bible text or a scrap of poetry in a rapid rattling little voice . Ettie was probably taking his coat and trousers down a peg when , after church , she sometimes said over Sunday dinner , " And of course John Whittaker had to unwind ! As the nasty saying goes , he sounds just like a sheep tin ' on a shingle . " Then she would flush and thrust out her bosom and clear her throat and looked extremely pleased with herself ; though she would also cast a mischievous glance at the children , and add , " Now that 's an expression you must never repeat . " In the children 's minds that dash was a dash also , a sort of sulphurous sizzle . Without being told , they knew what it meant . They knew sheep . And every time they were profoundly shocked . They were humiliated , too , to think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet they were helped over their shame and humiliation by a recognition of the literary aptness of the phrase . It caught with marvelous exactness the very way John Whittaker sounded when he spoke in meeting . The unconventional values of Art stood there revealed ; and they appreciated Art even as they recoiled from Dirt . And it was funny to reflect that John Whittaker , in all the glory of his cutaway and striped trousers , sounded like anything so awful . While repeating the Scriptures , too ! But Amos , their father , was capable of no such helpful changes of focus . He frowned and looked down at his plate .  | Ettie had borrowed that shockingly apt comparison from Aunt Rowena , who had been known to apply it to a Sacket cousin who stuttered . Just the same , Aunt Rowena was Virginia 's favorite of all her relatives on her mother 's side of the family . Children ask for certainty because they are not grown up ; and they expect this certainty to be supplied by the grown people who surround @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A child soon learns in terror that his authorities are fallible . And his terror is mixed with resentment . He begins to ask why , then , he must obey them . There is only one thing that can quiet his fears and disarm his resentment ; and that is when a grown person conveys a steady message , not verbally , but in a sort of warm and physical emanation : " In spite of everything , I love you . " And to Virginia , Aunt Rowena walked in a halo of love . It surrounded her whole body , like the light around the figure of a Byzantine saint . And when she smiled , it was as if she opened a window on the love inside her . The Charles " boys , " as some old-timers in Median still called them  --  though Marmion , the baby , was over fifty  --  were still small-town bankers in a city of about three hundred thousand . They lent money only on good security , but they lent it on character and family history as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a man took to drink or debauchery , if he moved to a smaller house or a house that cost too much , or if his grandfather had stolen a cow sixty years before , that man was unlikely to extract any money from the Charles Savings and Trust Company . They also refused to lend money to Roman Catholics , saying that Roman Catholics could cheat and lie and then confess and be absolved of all their sins , whereas money , once lent , could not be retrieved in the confessional . Uncle Marmion even said , one time before he thought , hearing an acquaintance was a Roman Catholic , that he had always supposed the man was as good a Christian as anybody . And there , across four hundred years , spoke Martin Luther through the Pennsylvania Dutch and through the Charles boys . They were thirty-second degree Masons partly for business reasons and partly for the fellowship of the brotherhood . In Uncle Marmion 's bedroom hung a photograph of a grinning young man , with a round straw hat on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two plump pretty girls in plumed picture hats pressing their cheeks to his . At the bottom were the words , " Everybody Loves a Shriner . " But one very strong reason for the Charles boys ' belonging to the Masons was that the Masons were anti-Catholic.  | In appearance they took after their Huguenot grandmother Charles who had been a Lamotte . They had little smiling dark eyes , like Virginia 's grandmother Littleton 's . Their gray hair tended to curl , like hers . Like her , they sometimes had a beguiling sweetness of manner . And like hers , their clothes inclined to nattiness . They went to Gus Altgelt and ordered suits conservative of cut and color , but of a quality whose excellence hit you in the eye . With these they wore maybe garnet ties with socks to match , or dark green ties and dark green socks ; and on their hands were massive diamond-set Shriner rings , and in their lapels were Masonic pins ; and they were always barbered within an inch of their lives . Virginia 's grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He noticed that the unmarried Charleses took the attitude that when Nannie had married , leaving them to stay at home and break their engagements and look after their mother , she had forfeited the right to be considered a full member of the clan . Grandmother Charles had left her money to be equally divided among her children . But Mr. Littleton suspected that the married children 's portions were pared down along the way . To work for money was one thing . To inherit it was quite another . And he called his brothers-in-law thieves and robbers . At this time , in one of his rages , when he was mowing the lawn with the horsedrawn mower , he had cut down all of Mrs. Littleton 's flower beds because the plants in them had been given to her by the Charleses . His denunciations and rages may not have been altogether unwarranted . In Median it was taken for granted that the Charles boys thankfully lined their purses with transactions which cut the legalities pretty fine . Also , there were several middle-aged women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been kept by Uncle Cedric or Uncle Douglas or Uncle Fitz . Only Uncle Marmion condemned this practice as unbefitting a Sunday school superintendent . He had been the Sunday school superintendent at St. Paul 's Lutheran church for a long time ; and even at the age of fifty and more , fluttered the younger prettier Sunday school teachers . Half earnestly , he was always courting one or another of them , but never to the point of matrimony . He liked to make their mouths water in anticipation of becoming Mrs. Marmion Charles , then tell them that they were wasting their time on him , that they ought to marry husbands their own age , and drop them with a manner suddenly paternal . On the side , he occasionally patronized a brothel of the highest grade .  | Neither the boys nor Aunt Lucy had what you could call tractable characters . Still , even during her mother 's lifetime , Aunt Rowena had been the head of the family , and had managed them and jockeyed them along . She welded their differences and steered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the moral aberrations of the boys were kept decently under cover . And they all obeyed her for the same reason that Virginia obeyed her : they knew she loved them . Then , too , the Charles house was a family graveyard . It was " full of dead men 's bones and of all uncleanness " : the dead doll , the dead books , and old red plush photograph albums in the 1+ front parlor , with pages and pages of dead people 's pictures , all looking too young somehow ; and old sidesaddles and old spotted mirrors hung askew in the attic , and old bedsteads stacked in the corners of the attic . Young people who were old now , living people who were dead now , had ridden on those saddles and looked into those mirrors and slept in those dismembered beds . Virginia saw these things when she and Benjamin went up there with Aunt Lucy to dust and clean . For Aunt Lucy " redded up " the attic just as she did the other rooms . All over the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handwoven coverlets , old handwoven tablecloths , a gray embroidered Indian shawl , a pair of old glass salt cellars , an old Bible printed in the German black letter  --  slipped out of a drawer or off a shelf to be shown and put away again . The value both Aunt Rowena and Aunt Lucy attached to these had a sort of greediness , as if they disputed them with death itself . And yet , because of Aunt Rowena , Virginia felt somehow that the corruption of these things had put off corruption , and had become purified , and that they were sacred because Aunt Rowena still loved the people who had touched them and owned them . It was Aunt Rowena 's abiding love for " those who have gone before " which prevented their expeditions to " the cimetry " from being gruesome . A trip to the cemetery was as good as a picnic , a rather formal picnic . Albert customarily drove the carriage , but Aunt Rowena and Aunt Lucy had the idea that it would n't be quite proper to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been almost as if he had come into a family bedroom while its occupants were sleeping . And so , those mornings , Aunt Rowena always drove . Aunt Lucy would have gathered flowers early and put them in a bucket of water on the back porch . She wrapped their stems in newspaper just before starting , and she also took along a brown jug of water . Both the aunts would be wearing  | thin white summer dresses , with touches of black , and black straw hats and black silk gloves , since they were still in half-mourning for their mother . They would go down the back walk to the carriage , which waited in the graveled space in front of the stable , and which Albert had just finished polishing with a chamois . Charlie Boy , a beautiful brown horse dappled darker brown on his haunches , with shiny black blinkers and nickel plating on his harness , would be standing there hitched up , while Albert held the bridle . The carriage was a surrey , and had cream-colored tassels hanging around its flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , would sit in the front seat with Aunt Rowena , and the other one would take the back seat with Aunt Lucy and the flowers and the jug . There were cream-colored tasseled dusters to tuck over their knees , one for the front seat and one for the back , though the trip was pavement all the way . Aunt Rowena would sit up straight with the whip and the lines in her hands . She was sixty-two years old , but she drove very well , and she knew she did . She touched the whip to Charlie Boy 's rump , and Albert let loose , and they went down the drive and into the street at a good clip . One of the sights of Jackson Avenue was the Charles sisters , with their garden flowers and their brown jug , driving in the tasseled surrey to Shady Rest . If they had been Vestal Virgins in a chariot , they could n't have looked much queerer to their neighbors . But , far from realizing the figure they were cutting , Virginia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cemetery itself , with its high iron fence and turreted gray stone entrance , was the most regal and imposing place they had ever seen . The gateman , swinging open the double wrought-iron gates , touched his cap respectfully . The sweeping lawns and tall grave trees were beautiful . They drove past mausoleums of mossy stone with paneled bronze doors , past bending angels with their fingers at their lips as if to counsel , " Hush ! " ? past couchant marble lambs where , Aunt Rowena told them , " some little child is buried , " past granite blocks and polished obelisks . But everywhere were shallow grassy mounds , like beds with neat green covers and small stone headboards . These looked modest and lowly in this ducal park . In spite of Aunt Rowena 's cheerful presence , Virginia did n't like to think what lay under those green quilts . Staring all around her , she did n't like what she saw . " I hope I 'm never buried here , " she said once , suddenly . " W'y ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | " I do n't know , " said Virginia , staring all around . She added , " Just throw me in the trash bin . " Aunt Rowena burst into charming laughter . Virginia , rather hurt , glanced back at Benjamin as he sat beside Aunt Lucy on the back seat , and was somewhat comforted to see that he was staring all around him , too , as if he understood what she had meant . That was one thing about Benjamin . Though he was only six , he had the most comprehensive alert intelligence . He reached out for a new idea , and looked it over , and immediately understood it , or at least he tried very hard . If it was your idea , this considerate reception gave you a sympathetic feeling toward him . It was a pity that he was so good . But Aunt Rowena and Aunt Lucy obviously thought that Shady Rest was everything it ought to be . For some time the air of paying a social call had been growing on them . Aunt Rowena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Charlie Boy 's bridle , and Aunt Lucy got out the flowers and the jug . I They walked across a grassy knoll , taking care to step around the graves , to a large chocolate-colored granite square standing upright and marked " CHARLES . " It was slickly polished on its two faces and rough around the edges , and always reminded Virginia of an enormous piece of fudge . Here also lay a row of shallow green mounds , the twins , and their two dead baby brothers , and Great-uncle Guy Mannering Charles . He had started " from the ground up " at the Vulcan Engine Works whose president had been a friend of Grandmother Charles 's . He had been caught and mangled to death in some machinery . Here were Great-grandfather Peter Charles and Grandmother Charles , " beloved wife of Peter " ? quite a family gathering in all . And Aunt-Rowena would nod in the direction of a rising slope and say to the children , " I do n't see why your mother do n't buy that plot while she still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shady Rest  --  gravel bank , good drainage . Somebody 's going to buy it one of these days . And it 's so near us folks ! " Then she and Aunt Lucy would kneel down and take the dry flowers out of the white tin vases at the foot of the mounds , and wrap them tidily in newspaper , and fill the vases with fresh water from the jug , and put the fresh flowers in . The big white urn beside " the monument " was kept full of geraniums and trailing mottled vines by the cemetery company  --  in " perpetual care , " an expression that gave Virginia the creeps . Then Aunt Rowena would say , " Now you children can run around a while . " Virginia and Benjamin knew that she and Aunt Lucy , kneeling there be-  | side the mounds , were going to pray . So , feeling awed and embarrassed , they wandered off . The squirrels were scudding across the grassy spaces , rippling their tails . The trees looked solemn and lovely . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children turned around and started back , they could see Aunt Rowena and Aunt Lucy sitting in the white iron filigree settee , quiet but social , as if they had just dropped in to chat a little with these members of their family who were dignified by death . Virginia did n't mind going to the cemetery even after her greataunt Edith 's death . Though she did not realize it at the time , it was Aunt Rowena who saved her from the worst of a hideous experience . Great-aunt Edith had married a widower a good deal older than she was ; and entirely without foundation , so far as anybody knew , was always accusing him of being secretly in love with some other woman . Aunt Edith 's own corpulence may have given her this idea , for she was enormous , and the women who in her imagination inspired her husband 's love were always slender . She was not very tall , but she had a body like a hogshead which she dressed in gaudy garments , purple wool trimmed with scrolls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had a small flat reptilian head , with graying hair carefully crimped at the sides , set far back behind her bosom , barely able to see over it . Also , she was very nervous . Her little black reptilian eyes never stopped blinking behind her glasses . Reared back in a chair , she let one arm rest on the chair arm , and her first two fingers never stopped performing a little scratching motion on it . She had a way of jerking up her chin and hitching her shoulders about when she said anything . I-ler husband , by whom she had no children , was as tall and thin as a beanpole , and had a patriarchal beard . He had bought an early Ford , an original Tin Lizzie ; and another well-known sight all over that part of Median was Aunt Edith on the back seat of the Tin Lizzie , filling it from side to side , and Old Brush ( as Aunt Rowena rudely called him ) on the front seat , with his long gray beard waving in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken him for . But the Charleses , half believing Edith 's complaints and tearful confidences , in spite of long acquaintance with her , half believed in Old Brush 's goatish nature . And he did look " like Brigham Young . " Aunt Edith and Old Brush went to Florida every winter . There they met an elderly woman named Mrs. Reed and her maiden  | daughter , Evelyn . Evelyn Reed was forty years old or more . Bu she baked entirely too many cakes and cookies which she pre sented ( ostensibly ) to Aunt Edith . And she was slender . She was as thin as a Reed , Aunt Edith said spitefully . Aunt Edith flew into a tantrum after every visit from the Reeds . She had always told Old Brush that she would kill herself if he did n't stop having affairs with other women . And this time , she said , she meant it . She returned from Florida alive . But , as it happened , the Reeds lived in Median , too ; and once when Evelyn rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered it . Aunt Edith had the worst tantrum ever . The doctor had to come and give her a sedative . Then , a few days later , the telephone rang and Old Brush answered it again , although Aunt Edith was rushing as fast as her size would allow her to answer it herself . It was Evelyn Reed again . Aunt Edith went upstairs and lay down on the bed . When Old Brush came up an hour or so later , she was breathing heavily and did not answer when he spoke to her . When the doctor got there , she was dead . At this time there were many phone calls , which Virginia overheard , between the Charles house and the Lacey house . On several evenings , after Virginia had gone to bed , Ettie took Amos into the bathroom and locked the door behind them . Virginia could hear her mother whispering in there , and her father replying in low tones . And once , as the bathroom door opened and her mother came out , she heard her cry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Aunt Lucy told me herself , We had to give Dr. Albright a hundred dollars ! ' Nobody has to tell me any more than that ! " Virginia was taken to Aunt Edith 's funeral . She had to walk past and look at her corpse in her " casket . " It was a special casket , made to measure , capacious and black and shiny and rather ridiculously carved with wings , as if anything short of a typhoon could waft Aunt Edith to the skies . In its purple padding Aunt Edith lay under a blanket of red rosebuds . But she stuck out from the knees upward ; and she was wearing a black satin dress thickly besprent with jet beads which Virginia had seen her in alive . Her glittering stomach and bosom rose in a great hump , so that her hand , holding one red rosebud and lying on this hump , was very far up in the air . Her face , by the same token , was far down in the casket ; and whether it was from the reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face looked dark and swollen . She had died in a temper fit , Virginia knew . And she still looked strangled with emotion .  | Then Virginia had to go upstairs " with the family . " As she sat in the front bedroom and reflected on what she had seen in the parlor , her horror grew . She could hear somebody playing on the piano downstairs and singing " Rock of Ages . " Aunt Lucy was sobbing quietly in a corner . But Virginia sat with her hands folded tightly between her knees , resting her weight on the balls of her feet , her legs trembling with the strain . She was filled to overflowing , not with sadness or the consolations of religion , but with the realization of death . Death was not beautiful like the trees and lawns in Shady Rest . These tried to deceive you . Just as she had always suspected ! Death was the ugliest thing she had ever seen , cold meat dressed up in satin and roses , and with just enough resemblance to a living body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was death cozy . This was nothing you could pay a social visit to . It was just cold meat , and would soon be rotten . And everybody had to die . She herself would be dead some day . " Oh , do n't dress me up in beads and satin , " she thought passionately . " Just throw me in the trash bin . Or maybe in the garbage can . Do n't put me in the parlor for everybody to stare at . " Then she heard a flurry and a stir downstairs at the front doors , which were open now , a trampling , exclamations , and the quick soft voice of the undertaker . Then , in a most unseemly way , there came the wrenching scream of wood against wood . When she went downstairs again , she saw two fresh orange scars on the door facings where the pall bearers had forced the casket through the doorway ; it was that broad . But at the moment when that shocking noise arose , she happened to look across the bedroom at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a long thick black veil thrown back from her pale face . She was looking straight before her and a little upward , wide-eyed ; and the compression of the corners of her mouth just hinted at that charming expression Virginia associated with Aunt Rowena 's face , as if she were smiling slightly . While Virginia looked , she put one blackgloved hand to her cheek and said , " My baby ! " Then her eyes filled and the tears ran down . Everybody there glanced at her and then at one another . Uncle Marmion shook his head at Virginia 's mother as if to say , " Poor Rowena is very much affected by it all . " But Virginia , looking at her great-aunt , thought , " Her baby ? W'y , Aunt Rowena is younger than Aunt Edith . How could she call Aunt Edith her baby ? " For two or three years afterward , the mention of death or the thought of death always reminded Virginia of Aunt Edith 's  | corpse , Aunt Rowena 's expression as she had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She recalled with some indignation how Aunt Edith had tried to shove Aunt Rowena into the hot oven that time ; and saw in her mind 's eye the white scars on the under sides of Aunt Rowena 's wrists . How could Aunt Rowena call Aunt Edith her baby ? Aunt Rowena had been the one who had always had to deal with Aunt Edith and bring her into line , as she had heard her mother say . But then at last Virginia 's mind opened . Of course ! Aunt Edith had been Aunt Rowena 's baby . And a fearsome baby she had been . A dreadful woman ! But Aunt Rowena 's wet face with that slight smile on it seemed to make even Aunt Edith all right somehow  --  just an awful baby who had never learned any better . Soon after Aunt Edith 's death , squabbles arose : " And Ettie , would n't you know Old Brush would act abused ? Ai n't that just exactly like him ? Because she was buried from her own home , where she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pa and Mother ! " There was the question as to who should get her cameo jewelry  --  the Charleses who had given it to her , or Old Brush who wanted to give it to his daughter by his other wife ; and which side should get her clothes : " Now , Ettie , you know that sealskin sacque of Edith 's cost three hundred dollars if it cost a penny ! And it 's not any more'n ten years old , if that . Edith got it right before Nelly Lockwood was married . I know because she wore it to the wedding . That was the first time she ever put it on her back . She says to me , How do I look ? ' and sort of switched herself ? " Aunt Lucy 's eyes filled with tears . " She always did like to look pretty foxy , you know ! And Nelly Lockwood was married right after the Spanish-American War . She married that Ramsay Axtell that like to died in Tampa of the fever . And a pretty-lookin ' bridegroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Old John Axtell 's boy . And they say he 's been so mean to Nelly ever since ! So I know that sealskin sacque of Edith 's ca n't be more'n fifteen years old , at the outside . And not a break in it . She always took good care of her things . And , Ettie , think how much good your mother could get out of a warm jacket like that . I would n't say a word if it was for Rowena or me . But why would either of us want a sealskin sacque ? Two old women like us ? But your mother likes to dress and go , and always did , every chance she gets down there at least . And you know Old Brush never paid for it . Edith paid for it out of her own money , poor child . Depend on that . And you ca n't tell me she  | would n't rather have her own sister get the good of it than any step-daughter ! " But Aunt Rowena always ended these conversations by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear ! " although Aunt Edith had probably been the ugliest woman in ten states . 4 T HE new " machine " was potentially there in Ettie 's words on the way to the interurban station : " Bungling along with a suitcase ! And two children ! I do n't see how your father expects me to do it ! " Amos used the Hup mainly for shuttling back and forth between the creamery and the house . It had room for only two people ; and when Ettie , who was stout and stylish , tried to squeeze into it with the rest of her family , she felt , as she said , like a regular laughing stock . But it was only a trial balloon . Though a tire was often flat or the engine would n't crank , and Amos in a pet ran to catch the street car , on the whole he was getting used to the notion of an automobile . And it was plain to Ettic that their " own home " demanded a new machine to match . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cottinghams . Look at Uncle Dick and Aunt Ruth . Look at Amos 's own cousin Lillian . They drove to church in their machines , and never had any trouble . Amos said , yes , but all those people had drivers . ( Since the inhabitants of Median were not yet quite sure how to pronounce " chauffeur , " those who could afford chauffeurs had " drivers . " ) W'y Pete , Uncle Dick 's colored chauffeur , put in his time under that machine of Uncle Dick 's . " Now you know very well , Amos Lacey , " said Ettie , " Lillian has n't got any driver . Lillian drives her own machine . " " Yes , " said Amos , " but Pete looks after it for her . " " Well , " said Ettie , " I 'd be ashamed , if I were a man , and saw my cousin Lillian drive up to church in that big Garvin of hers . I 'd think I could do pret ' near as well as a woman could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amos admitted . He greatly admired his cousin Lillian , Uncle Dick 's daughter .  | Then Ettie said that if they had a machine big enough for al ! of them , they could go out to Father Lacey 's a whole lot oftener . Amos 's father lived in the country only five or six miles beyond the Littletons ' . But , for some reason , going there had always required management and planning and false starts . Ettie gave the impression that she tried her best to get out and see Amos 's family oftener than she did , but that it was just too much of a trip . Amos , on his side , urged her to go out to the Littletons ' and take the children . He himself spent many Sundays there . Perhaps he hoped that Ettie would reciprocate . Perhaps he thought his hopes were not in vain when she said that if they had a big machine , they could go out to Father Lacey 's oftener . At any rate , not long afterward he bought " the Garvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amos went to have a talk with Quint Garvin who had been a Quaker till he had married and his Congregationalist wife refused to recant . Amos said he had in mind to buy a Garvin , only Garvins cost so darn much money . Quint said he had a demonstrator which had never been driven but once . That once , the salesman had tried to beat the gate at a railroad crossing and a switch engine had cracked the demonstrator 's rear axle . But this had been welded in the shop and was as good as new . Amos could have the demonstrator at a bargain . In this way it happened that Amos drove up to his house on Parkway one evening in a car which was not quite the American equivalent of a Rolls Royce , but the next thing to it . He had n't told Ettie he was buying it . When she saw it from the front porch , she screamed for the children and they all hastened out to the curb . Ettie beamed and rapped out questions and exultantly cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighbors were taking in this ennobling acquisition . The children stood silent . Virginia just took her handkerchief and wiped one tiny fleck of mud from the Garvin 's shining door . But both the children felt , too , that the family stock had gone up at least a hundred points . The Hup had been a little low rickety thing , with a top like a buggy top . The Garvin was a five-passenger , as black and resplendent as a patent leather shoe . It had a broad brass band across the radiator , and big brass lamps , and a speedometer whose numbers went up to sixty miles an hour  --  a mile a minute ! It looked heavy and powerful . Anybody could see that it was a high-class article , and had cost a lot of money . Uncle Dick and the Cottinghams had seven-passenger  | Garvins , with extra flap seats attached to the middle partitions . But the children thought they could understand why , as the junior partner in the Lacey Milk Company , their father had bought only a five-passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had cheated them a little , until they learned that it had been a demonstrator , almost the same as second-handed . Inevitably , they had begun to share their mother 's opinion of their father : He could never be trusted to do anything exactly right . At the same time , if Amos had bought the Garvin with the idea of going out to his father 's much oftener , he was fooled from the beginning . The first expedition the Laceys made in the new machine was to church . Then they drove out to the Littletons ' . Then Ettie had to show it to the Charleses . On this occasion , as the men stood admiring it in front of the stable , the women went back into the house . And Aunt Lucy said , looking at Ettie shrewdly , " Well ! I guess Amos must be doing pretty well ! " Ettie 's sparse sandy eyebrows flushed and the tears rose to her eyes . Fear of one kind or another continually haunted her , and lately it had been the fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " I can go up as well as the next fella . But I think it would just about kill me , Aunt Lucy , if I ever had to come down . " Then Sallie and Orvil arrived from Chicago , and the Laceys drove out to the Littletons ' again and brought Sallie and Orvil pack for a visit . Then there was a spell of rainy weather , and " that road into Father Lacey 's " was bound to be " too muddy to try it . " What with one thing and another , Amos had had his Garvin a good two months before Ettie , fretting and striving , succeeded in arranging her affairs so that going out to Father Lacey 's became possible . And thenceforward going everywhere was so easy in the new machine that Amos was lucky if he saw his father , whom he adored , six times a year , though six times were two or three times oftener than before . The children hardly knew their grandfather and grandmother acey as compared with the Littletons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom , but partly because that side of heir family had n't made much impression on them until about he time they got the Garvin . The general atmosphere at Grandother Littleton 's was such that it was readily assimilated by children . You might say it was picture writing as contrasted to cript . Grandfather Lacey 's demanded greater powers of interpretation , so that , until Virginia and Benjamin developed those powers , it hardly existed for them . Besides , it was not carried over  | into their daily life by their diffident father nearly as much a Grandmother Littleton 's and Grandmother Charles 's were carried over by their forceful mother . One thing , however , they had always realized : Their mother was clad in armor of some kind whenever they went out to Grandfather Lacey 's . And in result they themselves put on the best behavior . Also , from the minute the Garvin turned off the main macadam road into the narrow graveled road which ran through Grandfather Lacey 's property and was practically a private drive , a change came over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Going to Grandmother Littleton 's was foreign travel . But it was almost as if that narrow winding road to Grandfather Lacey 's led into another dimension . The normal hit-or-miss appearance of the roadside scenery was missing . There were no billboards , no big advertisement , painted on the barns , and no Castoria and whisky signs on the fences . There were no barns or houses or inhabitants except at first , and these were Grandfather Lacey 's property or tenants . The empty fields stretched out to the woods and sky , uniformly neat , in a sort of separate kingdom , in an even benediction of prosperity . Maybe it was because the children always went out there on a Sunday that a Sunday pall lay over everything . And it was n't always autumn , but it seems always to have been . There was a peculiar warmth and richness on the corn shocks and the stubble fields , an amber quiet , and a droop to the graying golden rod ; and near the creek , where some trees began , the turquoise patches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red leaves of the swamp maples . If it had n't been for the powerfuI noise the Garvin made , Virginia was sure that anywhere she could have heard a dry twig crack and faintly , rattle down . On gently rising ground beyond the creek stood a grove of black walnut trees . These thinned out gradually to enclose a nook of pasture with a few sheep nibbling over it . The sheep kept the pasture looking like a mown lawn . And the creek and then the big dark walnuts and this lawn-like vista made a very pretty ap proach , as if Corot had painted it . At the left as they rolled up , the conical top of a silo rose over an orchard . Then came the land . between the orchard and the yard . It was too much trouble , and Amos was too uncertain of his driving , to get out and unfasten the gate and maneuver the Garvin into the lane ; so that they always stopped at the front gate , and Amos honked the horn to let his family know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as closely mown as if the sheep had  | nibbled it , was surrounded by a low white picket fence . At the small white picket gate stood a gaunt gigantic pine tree , black against the sky , with only a few wino like limbs left near its top ? a landmark for miles around and for at least a hundred years . The house , small and low and white , looked even smaller behind the old pine . It had a kitchen ell at one side , but at first sight from the near corner seemed to be simply a length of gray shingles over a length of white clapboards . It had four front windows evenly spaced on either side of two front doors . The left-hand front door went into the front bedroom . The right-hand front door went into the sitting room . Against the narrow brick foundation grew a border of violets , white violets from the woods , and they were lovely in the spring . But their leaves were yellowing now . Along the sides of the house , in the sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two or three fat shepherd-checked hens had found their way into the yard , and went picking and ducking about . The difference between Grandmother Littleton 's and Grandfather Lacey 's could almost adequately be summed up in the difference between game roosters and Plymmouth Rock hens . It was also significant that Amos and his family did not go around to the screened porch and the dining room door , but went in at the right-hand front door . If Aunt Miriam was at home , she held open the door screen . If she was not at home , Grandfather Lacey performed this welcoming gesture . He was always right there in any case . Grandmother Lacey and Uncle Hank and his wife were the ones who lingered in the background . Aunt Miriam always kissed the children as if she meant it . So did Grandfather Lacey . But Grandmother Lacey submitted to be kissed , and Uncle Hank and his wife did no kissing at all . Ettie sometimes said in shocked tones , " Amos has never kissed his mother in his life ! " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quaker custom . At least a Quaker 's kisses were nothing to be distributed casually or socially , like a warmer kind of handshake . That kind of kissing was regarded as effusive , hypocritical , shallow , and rather messy . Virginia and Benjamin knew these things without being told . They automatically kissed their Lacey relatives because they always kissed their Charles and Littleton relatives ; and having started when they were small , did n't know how to stop now they were older . They were grateful to their aunt Miriam and their grandfather because they heartily kissed back , and seemed to forgive them for their error , and even to enjoy it . They disliked the way their  | grandmother submitted to the ceremony and the way their uncle Hank and his wife avoided it . They felt accused of misbehavior . They did n't like to kiss their grandmother Lacey anyhow . Such a withered shrinking muzzle ! And they would have needed a good deal of courage to kiss their Uncle Hank and his wife , Aunt Zelda . For these very reasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be shunned . But this strictly Quaker viewpoint did not occur to the children . Whenever they drove out to Grandfather Lacey 's , they had gone to Sunday school , but had skipped church so as to arrive in time for Sunday dinner . But dinner was never quite ready yet . Or if it was , it was felt that a polite interval ought to elapse between arriving and eating ; so that Ettie and the children did n't have to hurry as they laid their hats and coats on the bed and combed their hair in one of the downstairs bedrooms . These two bedrooms , front and back , were much alike . They were icily and crisply white . On a warm day you were agreeably cooled just to enter them . On a winter day you nearly froze to death , though then they were both cozily heated by little nickel-trimmed stoves . Except for the stoves , the children could probably not have named a single article of furniture in either of them . Of course there had to be a bed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all was merged in whiteness and neatness and starched thin ruffles and hard pale fabrics and the most amazing cleanliness . The children were used to highly efficient housekeeping . Nice people lived in well-kept houses . But this fastidious perfection had an air of inherent motivation , as if it had been moral or aesthetic . They laid their wraps on the hypothetical bed with care . In the sitting room their father and Aunt Miriam and Grandfather Lacey and Uncle Hank would be sitting around , making conversation . Grandmother Lacey and Aunt Zelda would have disappeared in the direction of the kitchen . Their mother joined this circle with her most affable smiling manner , so affable and smiling that there was a perceptible recoil in the others . The children boosted themselves on to the sofa and sat there silently , side by side . The sitting room was large and square and low of ceiling . It had a white wainscoting running all around it , a " chair board , " as they used to call it in Maumee . The wall opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white fireplace and big white cupboards , " presses , " which extended from floor to ceiling on either side . If the day was chilly , another squat nickel trimmed stove was standing in front of the fireplace , cheerily radi-  | ating heat . Above the mantel hung a large oil painting in a plain gilt frame . It showed a tree-bordered stream , and was mostly done in brown with yellow edges to the foliage to give notice where the sunshine was . It had been painted by Great-aunt Miriam , Grandfather Lacey 's sister , the present Aunt Miriam 's aunt , who had been the head of the Latin department at Gurney College until her death , the first female college professor in Maumee . The painting was a view of Little River , the creek that ran through the Lacey place , named after the Little River in South Carolina . There was no other picture in the whole room . Here again , because of the white fireplace and the big white presses and the white chair board and the thin white ruffled curtains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You did n't notice the color of the wallpaper or the rug . The furniture was sparse and plain and delicate looking , some of it middle-aged , some of it evidently very old , and yet not treasured on that account . The spindled chairs had comfortable faded cushions tied to their seats and backs . A newish yellow oak sectional bookcase stood against one wall . In it was nothing interesting , as the children knew , excepting the Brownie Book and some old bound volumes of Chatterbox . Otherwise there were dull-looking tomes , old histories and dictionaries and The Life of Elizabeth Fry and some of Aunt Miriam 's German books . The bottom doors of the left-hand press had been removed and thick fringed curtains hung in their place . Unseen behind the curtains stood the croquinole board the children would play with after dinner . As she looked around with the wonderment and restraint that Grandfather Lacey 's house always evoked in her , Virginia was also filled with wistful respect . If she had had to describe that house with one adjective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked just right to her . But it would n't have been just right for her . She could never feel relaxed enough when she was in it . And in that house her mother always acted like a cat on hot coals . It was more nearly right for her grandfather Lacey and her aunt Miriam , but not quite right for them either . So whom was it right for ? Who ought to live in it ? It ought to be just right for everybody , Virginia felt . Everybody ought to be as plain and honest and pure and well-regulated and enduring and delicate , yet well worn with living . Everybody ought to be . But most people were not . That house was like a small white temple built to some cherished abstraction . Where were the dirt , the confusion , the noise , the color , the multifariousness of ordinary life ? Where , most  | of all , were those genteel pretensions and displays of money so noticeable everywhere else ? Virginia felt ashamed at such nakedness , and then ashamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing her , so slender , so delicate , so immaculate , so well behaved ( in general ) , so opaque , so impervious to ordinary wounds , saying only what she should say , exhibiting only acceptable emotions , and very little of those , might have found at least a partial answer to what puzzled them about Virginia if they could have watched her against the background of her grandfather Lacey 's house . It might have struck them then that she belonged there more than anybody else present . Ettie , whose perceptions were very sharp , not to say razor-like , often said , without intending a compliment , " Oh , Virginia 's the Quaker in this family ! " Quakers set great store by education , partly perhaps because they had been excluded from the universities in England . And a long time after the public school system was inaugurated in the Middle West , their academies , having established reputations , survived . When Virginia 's grandfather , Robert Lacey , was growing up , however , there were no public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a high school education was readily available . Though most of these Middle Western Friends were farmers , short of cash , they usually found the money somewhere for sending their daughters , as well as their sons , to one Friends ' Academy or another . Robert Lacey went to " Friends ' " at Gurney in the northern part of the state . When he graduated , he began to think about marrying . His father was " comfortably fixed , " and promised him a farm on his wedding day . Thus the slight suspicion in some people 's minds that he was wooing Sarah Jane Craydock 's financial prospects , instead of Sarah Jane , may have been entirely false . Indeed old Amos Craydock was so pleased at the sight of a suitor with a farm in his pocket that the neighbors said , when Robert Lacey came courting , you could hear old Amos laugh all the way to Pigeon Ford . And yet this report sounded as if Robert was courting Amos as much as Amos 's daughter . And it was certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane would have to do , and that , an only child , she was sole presumptive heir to all her father 's property . But the main reason for suspecting Robert of making love to Sarah Jane 's money was that nobody could imagine why he wanted her . The best way of describing Sarah Jane is to set her against the  | chorus of Middle Western Quaker women in general . The norm was remarkable . These were plain intelligent women , hard-working and soft-spoken , courageous without expecting any credit , and in the midst of large families and frontier conditions , evocative of order and gentleness . Sarah Jane might not have seemed to differ much from this pattern except that she was a more negligible person than such specifications would inherently imply . Her exceptional quality was her insignificance . Now , in her late sixties , she looked like a little old snow-woman . She was barely five feet tall and constructed in three balls graduated in size , the smallest of which was her head , the next largest her middle part , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her back was as round as her bosom , and her little pot belly as round as her hips . Though she had borne five children , she had never had on a corset in her life . Corsets were regarded by older Quaker women as implements of vanity and deception . Quaker emphasis on honesty went to such lengths that corsets became a sort of lie ; and the fashionable woman of that time , soft and shapeless inside an hourglass shell of whalebone and stout muslin , became a mild abomination . Besides , to be healthy and active and equal to any work at hand was the important thing , not a stylish incapacity ; so that the dress reform movement , which came along with Nina Wilcox Putnam and Isadora Duncan in Virginia 's early childhood , would merely have taught Grandmother Lacey to suck eggs if she had been aware of it at all . Her spherical diminutive contours were actually rather neat . And she moved lightly for her age , though with deliberation . But her little pot belly under her little white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgust and derision , " If I did n't know how old Mother Lacey is , I 'd think she was going to have a baby every time I look at her . " For every day Sarah Jane wore cotton dresses . But the children never saw her in anything but her Sunday best , which was silk for summer and wool for winter . As a child and a young girl she had worn linsey-woolsey for every day , not because old Amos Craydock had n't been able to afford store cottons , but because the Quakers had boycotted cotton during the Civil War and for many years previous . Cotton was grown by slave labor . In her childhood and girlhood Sarah Jane 's underclothes had been of linen for the same reason , and now in her old age were still of linen . Ettie reported , " Miriam says her mother 's underwear is all pure linen ! " ? a fact which struck her as luxurious . But before the Civil War and during it their wives ' and daughters ' linen shifts and petticoats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quaker farmers could ill afford , but which they nevertheless afforded ; just as they also managed to buy their womenfolks ' expensive Quaker bonnets . Beautifully made of drab-colored silk , these were manufactured in Philadelphia , shipped to Cincinnati , and from there distributed throughout the Middle West . Sarah Jane no longer wore a Quaker bonnet . But she would have felt like a bedizened worldling in a hat . She wore little round pancake bonnets , like Queen Victoria 's , tied under her chin , and so oldfashioned that they had to be specially made for her by a milliner in Median . Her bonnets were black . So were her shoes . Otherwise her clothes were always gray or tan or brown . Quaker women never wore all black any more than they wore scarlet or emerald green . Blue ? Yes , sometimes gray-blue was very nice for a summer silk . And a muted eggplant purple was a favorite shade for a winter dress of wool . But a black dress ? Never . It might have suggested to the unenlightened that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in mourning . They did n't believe in the parade of the emotions , not even of grief . To mourn inwardly was often inevitable . But to mourn outwardly was showing off . Both were sometimes a selfish disregard of other people 's feelings . Then also , mourning was a formality , and Quakers did n't believe in formalities . Too often , in their opinion , a formality displaced the emotion it was supposed to represent . It was easy to dye your garments black and to put on the weeds of remembrance . But it was harder to have loved the imperfect departed during his lifetime , and to have behaved toward him in a loving manner . This latter course alone seemed worth following to Quakers . Most older women 's dresses in those days were made along the lines of Mrs. Littleton 's wrappers . But Grandmother Lacey 's dresses had no bosom-confining inner bodices . And even her best had no lace or beads or trimming or jewelry on them , not even any tucks or ruffles . They did not look poverty-stricken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they were plain . Their only ornaments , if you could call them ornaments , were a narrow turnover collar of white embroidery and a dab of white apron . Grandmother Lacey did n't even wear a wedding ring . She had never had one . Wedding rings were another formality . Her head was not much bigger than a cocoanut . Her hair , light brown in her youth , was now dull and yellowish ? " no-colored hair , " as Ettie called it . It was parted in the middle , brushed down flat across her skull , and wound in a great flat braided coil on the back of her head . When she let it down , it reportedly reached be  | low her knees , and Ettie said she was like a little radish all gone to top . Ettie took a sly satisfaction in making fun of her mother-inlaw . The children did n't like their grandmother Lacey either . That most of the time she seemed oblivious of them was an insult they could not forgive . That most of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation . During Sunday dinner she sat , not at the foot of the table where you would have expected her to sit , but at one side , motionless and silent , staring at the salt cellar or the butter dish , absorbed in some engulfing vacancy . Only now and then she reflectively winked one eyelid , like a cat . So far as Virginia could remember , her grandmother Lacey had never said a word to her but once . Then she had said , in a discontented tone , " Thee mother keeps thee too dressed up . " After dinner everybody sat in the dining room because the sun , moving westward , came in at the window and made this room more cheerful than the sitting room . This west window had a row of gray-painted iron brackets along each side of it , with flowerpots in the brackets . On a square drop-leaf table under the window stood more flowerpots in saucers . And in the brackets bloomed Grandmother Lacey 's pink oxalis , and on the table bloomed her pink begonias , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia never liked afterward . In front of this flowery window stood Grandmother Lacey 's small low rocking chair . After she and Aunt Zelda had done the dinner dishes , there she sat , with her arms hugged across her stomach and her head bent , paying no attention to anybody , never moving , except to wink reflectively into space , like a cat , or to lick her thumbs and smooth back her hair behind her ears in a swift catlike gesture . Once in a while the conversation penetrated her self-absorption . Then she would titter with a quick scared upward glance , clap one hand across her mouth as if she were ashamed of being audibly amused , and utter some small spiteful comment ; whereupon all the other Laceys paused in what they were saying , looked at her , and smiled upon her , as if she had been a half-witted child to be encouraged in her mental offerings , no matter how inept or illnatured . Whenever the talk turned upon Uncle Dick or any of his family , she was sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth , had grown up in the Stillwater neighborhood , a contemporary of Grandmother Lacey 's ; and when Grandmother Lacey had been the heiress of the community , the Barbara Hutton , the Doris Duke of Sharon County , Aunt Ruth 's family had been almost poor . They had still lived in a log cabin . Now , of course , Aunt Ruth lived in Median in a big brick house , and had two maids  | and a cook and a yardman , and rode around in a seven-passenger Garvin behind a colored driver ; so that , hearing anything whatever said about Uncle Dick 's family , Grandmother Lacey always tittered in that scared way , clapped one hand across her mouth , and said , " Ruth thinks she 's got it now . But I 've always had it . " Consequently , though her underclothes were of linen , though her Sunday dresses were never of cotton , though she would not wear a hat , a corset , a black dress , or a wedding ring , and so conformed to the Quaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in formalities , Grandmother Lacey herself was a good deal of a formality . In her self-absorption and stupidity and spitefulness she was no Quaker . It was her family 's humorous tolerance of her , and their respect and even affection for her , in spite of her unpleasant disposition , which were more truly Quaker , and somewhat redeemed her . The discipline of her religion had been imposed upon her from without , and had resulted only in repression . It was just as much of a deception as if it had been made of whalebone and muslin . She did n't understand the reasons for those customs which held her in so tight , and had never looked for reasons . They were a second nature to her and to many old women like her , and bereft of meaning , had produced a repellent paucity . Ettie said magnanimously , when she was not making fun of her , " I feel sorry for Mother Lacey ! She said to me once , I 've never had a soul that I could talk to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her father , an old man when she first remembered him , had been , besides , no person a timid girl could take into her confidence . She had been an only child . She had married Robert Lacey because her father had expected her to marry Robert Lacey , and married , was as completely under her husband 's domination as she had been under her father 's . She appeared to have learned that her opinions and wishes did n't count , however tolerantly they were regarded , and to have given up long before what little character she may have had . This renunciation was probably less renunciation and more the lack of anything to offer . And yet that it had once been painful to her was indicated in those small resentments which still flashed out , in her fast grip upon her girlhood 's importance , and in her stubbornness about small things . In this tacit acquiescence in her own indignity , she was least of all a Quaker . For " Quaker , " like most words , is heavy to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time . Quakers , that is , were among the foremost in believing in their individual value . To trample upon the lowliest person , they thought , was to  | insult divinity in its common vessel . To consider yourself of no account was a similar and equal insult . This doctrine , holding human beings to be the free and rational agents of God , not his subjects , represented the extreme of Protestantism . At a time when authoritarianism prevailed on earth , in heaven , and in every human habit of living and thinking , it was total revolution , since the ethics of a person 's religion underlies everything he does . It was war , not only against any authoritarian church , but also against any authoritarian state or social hierarchy . And it was as rebels against the church , the state , and the nobility , their contemporaneous Eden and status quo , that Quakers made the definition of themselves . Ettie , in speaking of Virginia 's stoicism , called her a regular Quaker as often as she called her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in slowly gathering rebellion , was truly more of a Quaker than even Ettie dreamed . Sarah Jane , by some freak of heredity ( or other mystery of transmission ) , was still , spiritually speaking , a subject and not a citizen . And by an uncanny congruence of appearance she might have been a dumpy little Irish peasant woman . Her sallow monkey face was Irish , with its broad muzzle , vertically wrinkled , and its fat pug nose . For that matter , the dented high hat and clay pipe and gaiters of a squireen would have made a fairly suitable costume for her oldest son , the children 's father . And it was too bad that of all the more imposing beaks which heredity could have handed down to them , it had fastened on the faces of both Virginia and Benjamin their grandmother Lacey 's pug  --  somewhat modified , it is true , with Virginia more delicate and impudent , with Benjamin more blunt and uncompromising , but still a pug . One of Ettie 's meanest tricks was to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got her grandmother Lacey 's nose ! She 's little-boned like her grandmother Lacey . She 's got that same light yaller-brown hair that turns no-color instead of getting gray . " ( Ettie had recently had a few gray hairs worked into her sandy switch . ) " She 's going to look just like her grandmother Lacey when she grows up ! " Virginia , who would rather have looked like anybody else on earth , sometimes believed this humiliating prophecy , though it was only another instance of the game of likening her to almost any of her forebears . But at times she dared to doubt it simply because she knew her mother knew how much she hated it . For she was beginning to learn that her mother always knew with clairvoyant accuracy where it hurt most , and hit there . On the other hand , that propensity to expect what you dread most made her  | wonder if her mother might not be correct , if something about her might not only look like Sarah Jane , but be like Sarah Jane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two children , Virginia had always been the one who never assumed that she had any rights at all , but regarded anything pleasant as a kindness done her , and anything painful as a deserved reprisal  --  an attitude , however , that has made the turning of the worm a proverb of rebellion . To be the sort of grandmother whose daughter-in-Iaw can painfully twit your granddaughter with her resemblance to you must not be agreeable . And Sarah Jane was not very comfortable with any of her family . Sometimes she ran away from them . And then her children worried about her in the same way and the same language as if she had been a temperamental cow of erratic habits . When she came back , with her dress damp to the knees or her hair half down , she always had one of two excuses : She had been looking for a hen 's nest or she had been walking in the woods . " Oh , those chickens of Mother 's ! " said Miriam to her father ; and , " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , was just as uniquely Sarah Jane 's as the chickens were . These and her flowers were all she was fond of , so far as anybody could see . Looking for eggs , she could climb into the haymow at the risk of breaking her hip , or walk clear across the meadow , and nobody could say her nay . And she had a special right in the woods because she had taken it under her protection . All her father 's land was hers of course . But her husband managed it for her , and she had nothing to say about any of it except the woods . There she had never allowed a single tree to be cut down or even any underbrush cleared out , and was amazingly stubborn in her opposition . This was a grievance to such an excellent farmer as Robert Lacey . He never quite came to the point of overruling her . But Sarah Jane did n't trust him . She patrolled her woods , almost expecting every time she went there to see the fresh gashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned over . Robert Lacey had never tried to understand his wife 's small irritating ways . He had never thought it worth his while , although he loved her as a creature in his care . Mother would n't let the woods be thinned , and that was that . He had never stopped to think that , just as Sarah Jane had been born in the house she still lived in , she might very well have grown up in that woods . With only one parent , and that one old Amos Craydock , any girl would have been glad of the woods to take her questions and her sorrows  | to . And later , with a husband like hers , so handsome , so kind , so able , so honest , so well beloved by everybody , she could find a little companionship there . For if you were a Quaker , you could never laugh too loudly or cry or lose your temper or make a nuisance of yourself in any way . Old Amos had made a nuisance of himself . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day , when the old dog had growled at him , he had lifted up his cane by the ferrule end and killed the poor old thing with one mighty stroke , and he had been nearly seventy at the time . As a neighbor had said , any dog would be a fool to growl at Amos Craydock . But he had had no notion of allowing his daughter to copy him . In the name of his religion , but in that same relationship by which a convexity on one side is a concavity on the other , Amos had seen to it that Sarah Jane never said what she thought or did what she pleased , or had a tantrum or shed a tear in consequence . No wonder she would n't let the woods be cut over or the tangled vines and bushes cleared . She probably loved them as she had never loved a human being : She could weep before them without shame . And then she was half Welsh and half Irish , though part of it was Ulster Irish . And Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one side , there is no doubt that Sarah Jane talked to her trees and flowers and rabbits and snakes as she paced her private paths , and slogged through the mud in shady places , and slipped on the stepping stones across the Little River . She held her dress high in front , and the branches snatched at her hair . She laughed as she talked , and lost her temper , and even wept . A child of one of the tenants saw her once , and ran home nearly scared to death . He thought he had seen a crazy woman . When the other Laceys heard what the tenants ' boy had said , they were embarrassed and tried harder than ever to keep their mother from straying . But Sarah Jane , with that childishness she had never been without and that was growing on her , slipped out on the sly . At those Sunday dinners there was always chicken . Chicken was the festive dish . And Ettie , after ten years of marriage , still did n't feel enough at ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't abide chicken . When Amos wanted to tell them , she objected sharply , as if determined that nothing should be plain sailing between his family and her . She asked for the liver and the gizzard , which organs she managed to chew and swallow  | while never ceasing to smile and nod and keep up a social conversation . She held her back stiff and nodded graciously from the top of her spinal column , like royalty from its carriage . It is a common experience for a married woman among her husband 's relatives to feel that she is on trial for some crime she has not committed , but which she can never expiate . And this by itself would have been enough to make Ettie even more self-assertive than usual . But the air the Laceys breathed was a special kind of air , and their surroundings were a special kind of surroundings , and among them Ettie gasped for life like a low-countryman in the mountains . The more she admired a person , the more necessary it was for her to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquer him . Her tributaries , people she had admired and conquered , were what she called her friends . The only people for whom she did not feel this clutching antagonism were those she could easily despise and so forget , her mother-in-law , for instance , and Hank and his wife , Zelda . Her jibes at them were only to distress Amos . But she admired her father-in-law and sister-in-law , and could not conquer them . She could n't even make a dent in them . They went out of their way to be nice to her . They would have been chagrined to learn that she did n't like chicken , and would have gone to any amount of trouble to get her whatever she wanted to eat . They paid her the most courteous and marked attention . But Ettie had found from them that you can fight and conquer only an enemy who will fight you . You can not fight a handsome old man like Robert Lacey who meets you with disarming smiles , who gives you without being asked all you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Miriam , whose amiability never cracks . All Ettie 's efforts to prove her superiority to those two were like shouting at a deaf man or swaggering before a blind man . They chose not to hear her shouts or see her swaggers , at the same time convincing her that her behavior was in bad taste and even morally wrong , though exactly how they did it she could not have said . All her attempts turned awkward . She found herself talking too fast and too much , and therefore talking all the harder . Every smile was wrung out painfully , so that she smiled and smiled . She laughed too soon and mirthlessly . And as she kept nodding in that royal way , she thrust out her bosom and moved convulsively in her chair . She knew that her clothes were smart and conservative and expensive . But among the Laceys , they looked all wrong . She was constantly reminded of her four years in Friends ' Academy ,  | when she had had this same sensation of resentment and bewilderment , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her being able to make out where she was at fault . For she had graduated from the Pigeon Ford grade school at the age of eleven at the head of a class of six ; and the Charleses had been proud of her . Instead of letting her go to the public high school , they had supplied the money to send her to a Friends ' Academy , not the one at Gurney where Robert Lacey had gone , but another one at Pleasantville only twenty miles away . She had boarded at a doctor 's house . " Friends ' " was a private school , but not at all the sort of place that " private school " suggests . It was the best school anywhere around , but merely from a scholastic standpoint  --  not the best in the sense that Miss Reba 's in Median was the best . Ettie thought longingly of Miss Reba 's , and rather scorned the Academy . And though she rather scorned the Quakers , too , for being plain and countrified , she found at Friends ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she had not been born and to which she did not measure up . All the Quakers were kind to her , kind beyond her experience . But she suspected them in their very kindness of trying to put her right somehow , and she could not tell where she was wrong . She thought she was the object of some stealthy missionary work . She and the doctor 's daughter , who was not a Quaker either , had revenged themselves by calling the Quakers " Old Thee 's " and " Holier-than-thou 's . " And now , among her husband 's relatives , she thought angrily , " Old Thee 's ! Holier-than-thou 's ! " She could never foresee how Father Lacey and Miriam were going to take anything she said . Once she had admired the china on the dinner table . It was the best china , brought out in her honor , a full set of old brownish-pink willow ware , and very beautiful . But when she had said so , just mentioning by the way a similar set at Cousin John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lacey and Miriam had looked down their noses , and then had set themselves to address her agreeably on other subjects , as if to cover up the mistake she had made . What mistake ? For the life of her Ettie had n't been able to tell as she had sat there with bosom heaving and venom flooding to her heart . The very food tasted strange to her . It all had a unique quality . There was always a large bowlful of milk gravy , and there were mashed potatoes and creamed dried corn and a couple of fresh vegetables if it was n't wintertime , and home-canned vegetables if it was , and brown bread and that salt-rising bread Mother Lacey  | was so famous for . At the far end of the table stood a large white pitcher of milk , and all the Laceys drank copious quantities of milk . There were mildly pickled pears and home-canned fruit or fresh stewed fruit . Everything was good and cooked with care . The dishes and the silver were arranged with exquisite precision . But , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decency of that table arose and hit you in the face . It was all so plain , so good , so healthful , and so unseasoned ! It had about it that clean blank superlative character which you associate with the best dairy products . Then , too , as Ettie often said , Mother Lacey was enough to take anybody 's appetite . She sat as motionless at the table as she sat in her rocking chair because she had stomach trouble , and was not supposed to eat any of the food before her . But once in a while a look of greed which was alarming would appear in her eyes as she stared at something she was not allowed to have . Then she would snatch a piece of bread from the plate , tear it into fragments , and swallow it ravenously . Or she would take her own spoon and dip it into a vegetable dish and gulp down the spoonful without chewing . Her table manners scandalized the children . But they were even more scandalized when presently she opened her mouth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout . Ettie said frowningly to Amos afterward , " What makes Mother Lacey belch that way ? " unaware that he and the children asked themselves the same question about her sometimes , but , unlike her , had the forbearance not to ask it out loud . With a similar forbearance , nobody frowned at Sarah Jane or tried to catch her eye or shook his head at her when that rude noise erupted from her . It is safe to say that nobody mentioned it to her in private . The whole family spread its protective umbrella over her . There was never any rice or coffee on that table . Because rice and coffee had once been raised by slave labor , Grandfather Lacey 's still went without rice and coffee . This abstention had become a habit , without reason for its continuance , and was another formality adhered to by people who thought they had discarded formalities . The preserves and canned fruit were sweetened as slightly as possible , as if in sinning , Grandmother Lacey sinned as little as she could . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and molasses , and had used honey and maple syrup instead . Amos , who had been brought up on maple syrup , still sent every year to Vermont for milk cans of it , and ate it on  | his bread for breakfast . ( Pancakes had eggs in them , and since his father could n't eat eggs , neither could he . ) The " plain language " also had once been something more than a gratuitous choice of pronouns . In the seventeenth century " thee " and " thou " had been the language of intimates and common people , as if among the lowly all were intimates . To address a person as " you " was to call him a social superior or a stranger or both . But as a group Quakers were the first democrats , and their other name was " friends . " Many a Friend had been dragged off to jail for saying " thee " to a nobleman . So now the Lacey family , who had never seen a nobleman , went on saying " thee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Eli gave the logical reason that it was correctly an intimate form of speech . But actually it had a sweet familiar sound to them . The tendency to magic-making is very deep-seated . It is the dramatization of hope , a variant of the Freudian dream , and springs so far back in human experience that it is almost as easy not to hope and not to dream as not to practice magic . But Quakers were the enemy of magic . They had set their faces against this form of superstition , this holdover from childhood and savagery in adult civilized people ; and had dispensed with all sacraments and rituals , all magic , in their ostensible worship . And in spite of such neo-Quakers as Sarah Jane and Amos , those who were most Quakers succeeded in resisting magic , even when they did not recognize it by that name . The inner reality it imitated was what they had originally pursued , and still pursued . The use of the plain language seemed to Amos like a becoming deference to both his parents . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character to him . It was the form of address you used in speaking to your father ; and Amos 's father more nearly approximated God in his eyes than any abstraction . But Ettie would have been caught dead before she would have tried to say " thee " or allowed any member of her family to say it . Thus there were some awkward moments when Grandfather Lacey said , " Benjamin , does thee ? " and then , " Do you ? ? " In the relaxed expansive mood that always came over him when he was with his father , Amos also slid into the plain language without realizing that he had . And then he , too , catching Ettie 's outraged eye , would stop and stiffen and carefully say " you " for the rest of his visit , which was thenceforward a little spoiled . When Amos said " thee " to his father , it seemed like disloyalty to his wife . Therefore he said " you " unless he slipped . He could  | never have done so , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ettie alone . He was able because he knew his father gave him leave . He relied upon his father not to feel hurt or be annoyed when he said " you " to him , trusting that he would understand the situation . And Amos relied and trusted rightly . Robert Lacey himself said " you " to everybody present when Amos and his family came to visit ; and triumphing over the habit of a lifetime and the inelasticity of old age , forgot only a few times , so thoroughly did he understand his son 's predicament , so willing was he to put aside the nonessentials for what was more important . Both what he did and his ability to do it were no small things . What Episcopalian would or could give up holy communion , what Chinaman would or could burn his ceremonial coffin , in order that his daughter-in-law of different views might feel at home in the family ? It was the essential and fundamental Quaker in Robert Lacey who had , three hundred years or so before , said " thee " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying it for the same reason . This was the sort of thing that made that house a small white temple . Old Amos Craydock had built it , and he had been a violent man and a rich man who had made his money only for himself . His family , in Ohio , had been Abolitionists . There had been more than one nigger in the Craydock woodpile . His sister had written Abolitionist poems which were published in the Freeman . But his only interests had turned toward making money ; and in this he did not so much turn against his relatives as neglect their other traits for one only : Quakers had always been good traders . In any locality where they were long established , in Enb land , in the Eastern states , their wealth was as proverbial as their honesty . No gentlemen , the Littleton contempt for " barter " had not held them back . American Quakers , qualitatively , more than Yankees , typified the Northerner who ' had won the Civil War ? whose hands were the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trader : liberty and equality ( and high tariffs ) . Amos Craydock , in Warren County , Ohio , had been a trader , a sort of middleman , who bought anything from a brass kettle to a drove of hogs if he thought he could make a profit on it . But most of his revenue had been derived from a teamsters ' tavern which stood beside a stretch of stumps and liquid mud , the road to Cincinnati . He was part owner of this tavern , a rowdy brawling den of vice , as no conscientious Quaker could have been except that it was a lucrative investment . Being thus well heeled early in life , he came out to Median when that city was only one log store and  | one log cabin . He put his savings into a tract of land . He was the first Quaker in the Stillwater neighborhood , which a little later became a Quaker settlement . He was a regular Welsh giant , six feet three inches tall , and broad and bony , a grim cursing hellraising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undefeated wrestler . In his maturity he was the largest landowner in the Stillwater community and one of the richest men in Sharon County , as rich men went those days . All his life he was the scandal of his fellow Quakers . He would undoubtedly have been read out of meeting if several of the Overseers had not owed him money . His first wife was a strong-minded woman , a Quaker preacher , who traveled from meeting to meeting . People said she refused to go to bed with him , and at any rate spent her time far away from such close quarters . Out in the Mississippi Territory , under the concern to bring the noble savages to Jesus , she was waylaid , tortured , tomahawked , and robbed by a wandering Creek who afterward gave himself up at the local garrison , displaying her gray scalp , and professing himself a true believer . She had died , he said in admiration , exhorting him and praying for his soul . Eli Lacey said it had been a case of Creek meeting Creek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young enough to have been his daughter , utterly subdued by him , and barren except for one ewe lamb , Sarah Jane . Ten years after Robert Lacey married her , old Amos died , and thenceforth Robert had the management and proceeds of his wife 's nine hundred acres besides those of the three-hundred-acre farm his father had given him . He had already moved into the Craydock house . He began buying up carloads of lean shoats , fattening them over the summer , and selling them at a good profit at the Median stockyards . He also bought carloads of half-broken horses from the West , trained the best of them for saddle horses , the next best for carriage horses , and the worst for work horses , and sold these , too , at the stockyards for more than twice what he had paid for them . Then , at the advice of his brother Dick , who had started a milk business in Median , he began to develop a herd of dairy cattle . As he prospered , people borrowed money from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of one-man bank , doing his business by word of mouth , and simply making memoranda of his transactions in a pocket notebook . In forty years of such informal banking , which often involved complicated rights and holdings and large amounts of real estate , he was never known to have cheated anybody out of a cent , and only one man was ever suspected of cheating him . When this case was taken to court ,  | there was no evidence except a memorandum of the deal in Robert 's notebook . But such was his reputation that he won the case on the testimony of character witnesses alone . About that time the Friends ' Academy where he had gone was reorganized into Gurney College . He took an active part in raising funds for the purpose , and contributed a good amount himself . He was made a trustee of the college , and stayed on the board of trustees till he died . He taught the boys ' class in the Stillwater Meeting First-day school for nearly twenty years . He was a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest that he was a local hero . It never occurred to him that his fine appearance , his abilities , and virtues put less well-favored people in the shade . This seldom occurred to the less well-favored , for he was lovable beyond the ordinary . He was a living demonstration of the fact that a good man could make a lot of money . And his neighbors seemed to stand in need of such a demonstration . As Virginia first remembered him , death had already touched him with its hand . He suffered from an ailment which later killed him . He walked with a stick and was often in pain , though nobody could have told he was except that now and then he fell silent , and a look of listening came over his face . he had given up teaching the boys ' First-day school class . He still attended to his business affairs ; he was still on the board of trustees at Gurney ; but Uncle Hank had taken over all responsibility for the farms . Virginia remembered him best as he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was a good deal like the sitting room , but even larger . It had the same kind of high white fireplace and big white press built in between the fireplace and one wall . Between the fireplace and the other wall was the sunny window edged with pink oxalis and pink begonias . In front of the fireplace , with the first cold nights , stood a tall base-burner , coated with fancy nickel work , straddled on stout bow legs of nickel , and wearing a tall nickel cap . Through a square of isinglass panes in its facade the fire glowed red . On the mantel the old rectangular mahogany clock had a picture of two dove-like maidens painted on its glass . In concession to Grandfather Lacey there were no curtains in the dining room . And the green shades were rolled clear up , leaving the windows with their small square panes exposed from top to bottom . The room looked stripped and bare and bright . A rag carpet covered the whole floor . Grandmother Lacey had made it . Its hit-or-miss variegated colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture was hard and smooth . Opposite the fire-  | place stood the long pine table ; and behind the table were the two steps , the door , and the slant of boarding that marked the upward course of the closed-in stairway , painted white to match the rest of the woodwork . An odd thing about them was that neither Virginia nor Benjamin had ever opened that door or set foot on that stairway . Virginia sometimes wondered what the upstairs bedrooms looked like . But she did n't wonder at the fact that she had never seen them , or at the impossibility of simply walking to the stair door , opening it , and going up . In a formal sense Grandfather Lacey had no manners at all . And yet his good manners were always implicit . Without being instructed in so many words , the children were always on their best behavior there . A perceptive courtesy , which yielded before it was pressed , prevailed . It was more adamant against quarreling and loudness and rudeness than the solid bricks of the conventions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of going upstairs without being asked . If Benjamin had been so obtuse as to do so anyway , Grandfather Lacey would undoubtedly have said to him , " That 's all right , Benjamin . Thee may go upstairs whenever thee wants to  --  whenever you want to " ? so manifestly excusing him , with such a warmth of ready pardon , that he would have been embarrassed and would not have repeated his error . This atmosphere of almost tactile awareness of other people 's feelings and of unquestioned acquiescence in their claims emanated from Grandfather Lacey and warmed the room like warmth from the base-burner . That Grandfather Lacey 's manner was not good manners but something better  --  the soul of good manners  --  and that nevertheless he and his father and his grandfather and his great-grandfather had been among the earliest of the Middle Western pioneers , brought up in the roughest surroundings , formed a contrast that Virginia , as a child , never thought to marvel at , but sometimes made her marvel afterward . The door to the kitchen was held open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small end had been cut off an inch or so . Once Grandfather Lacey said to Benjamin , " Do you see that conch shell over there ? You go and get it . " Then Grandfather Lacey put it to his mouth , and puffed out his cheeks , and the conch shell emitted a rousing bellow . The children 's father , much pleased , said reminiscently , " Well , there 's the Bull of Bashan ! " then said to Benjamin , " See if you can do that . " Benjamin blew till he was red in the face , but all the noise he could make was the faint roaring of his breath through the shell . And from his father 's  | laughter he perceived that his father had n't been able to do any better when he had been a little boy . " Your great-grandmother Craydock used to blow on that to scare the wolves away when your great-grandfather Craydock was away from home , " Grandfather Lacey said  --  a sentence evocative of cold and starlit nights , the wolves trotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snuff at the warm cracks of the sheep house and the cattle barn ; Great-grandmother Craydock , a pretty , timid little thing , as Virginia had heard , standing in a lighted doorway , perhaps this very dining room doorway , blowing valiantly on the conch shell ; and at that fearsome bellow , the wolves running away , slinking off again . Then , too , where had the conch shell come from ? With some visiting Friend from the West Indies ? ? Rum and molasses and the slave trade , the massacres of San Domingo , and the colonial policy of the British , a suburb of hell to Quakers . George Fox had made a visit there , and so had Zachary Dicks and other Quaker missionaries after him . Virginia had heard about Zachary Dicks . Soon after the massacres of San Domingo he had come back a zealot and a prophet . With hair-raising eloquence he described the slaves ' revolt , and predicted a like vengeance of the Lord on all who held their fellow men in bondage . At Rush River in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had said , peering about him , " Lo , your house is left unto you desolate , to be the habitation of bats and owls . " And three years later this was truly so , though the Quakers had not been murdered by the blacks . The little clapboard meeting house stood empty . The weeds were growing among the low slabs in its graveyard . Only a handful of Quakers , atypically timorous or atypically adjustable , were left on Rush River . The others had all gone over the mountains to the " ' hio country , " the Northwest Territory , the New Eden , where slavery had been outlawed . Among them were the Laceys ; and in Warren County , Ohio , more than twenty-four hundred Quakers had preceded them , Friends from all over the South , including the Craydocks from North Carolina . Virginia sat on the floor , holding the conch shell over her ear , and " heard the ocean . " But mingled with the ocean 's distant roar she heard the clamor of those other things as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zachary Dicks in South Carolina , the wolves , the dark woods pressing down on the little moonlit clearing in Sharon County , Maumee , Great-grandmother Craydock in the doorway of this very house  --  all gone now . Still here she sat , Virginia Lacey . Long surges of emotion , intimations , mysteries that  | called away back yonder , moved in Virginia as music moves the heart . Across from the kitchen stood an armless slat-backed splintbottomed chair . Grandfather Lacey always sat in it , with his cane leaning beside him . He had sat in it so much that he had rubbed the varnish off the middle of the slats , and the bottom was shaped . like a basin . This chair stood against the wall , outside the family group as everybody sat around after dinner . And yet nobody turned his back on Grandfather Lacey . They all hitched their chairs around to face him . Though he sat against the wall , he sat in the center of attention . To Virginia , her grandfather was an unmistakably great man . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now as white and soft as cotton , and stood up loosely and becomingly around his pink bald spot . His short squarish beard and big mustache merging into it were also white and cottony . You knew that underneath the beard there was a large square chin . His prow-shaped nose , with fleshy flanges , overhung the mustache like a promontory . His eyes were small and black and shining . They had a sad look , a keen look , and a kind look all at once , a sort of triple vision . His eyebrows were still thick and dark , and slightly tilted toward his nose as if in concentration . His forehead , high and wide and rounded , was creased with wrinkles , and between his brows were three deep wrinkles in the formation of a trident , like a natural caste mark . He had what people call a fine head , a massive handsome head . In his face the first feebleness of old age was apparent but denied . Amos was n't much to blame for identifying his father with God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait of that Personage . He was one of those men who shed an individual style over everything they wear . You could not have told by looking at him what his business or profession was , but you would have known that he was excellent at it . He might have been a famous sculptor or a bishop . You could not have told what social class he came from , but you would have seen that anywhere , with anybody , he would be wholly at his ease . It was for this latter reason that Ettie admired him . " Law , " she used to say , " Father Lacey could go to Buckingham Palace and know exactly what to do when he got there . " Father Lacey , in actuality , had never been outside the state of Maumee . On those Sundays he wore a gray flannel shirt , since he was not going out , with a black bow tie just visible under his beard . His black coat was pushed back so that his suspenders showed . His soft shapeless flannel trousers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his feet were gray woolen socks , knit by Grandmother Lacey , and old brown leather bedroom slippers . All his clothes were roomy and country cut . They hung on his big frame with negligence and chic . Ettie had given him those old brown leather slippers one Christmas . She said to Amos in front of the children , " Whenever I give Mother Lacey a Christmas present , she never takes it out of the tissue paper . Zelda told me so . She puts it away in a drawer some place , and you nor I nor nobody else ever lays eyes on it again . But Father Lacey ? Well , of course Father Lacey is a different story altogether . He always seems so glad to get whatever you give him . Thank you , Luthetta ! ' " She imitated Grandfather Lacey 's slight endearing lisp . " Ever since I gave him those slippers ? How long ago was it ? W'y , Amos , it must ' a ' been six years ago , the year after Benjamin was born , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good again  --  I do n't think I 've ever gone out there once that he did n't have them on ! " Whenever Ettie said this , Amos smiled that smile of his , divided between his loyalties , distressed but well intentioned . He knew that his mother regarded Ettie 's Christmas presents as impudent and tactless , as an insistence upon customs which were not Quakers ' . He felt like saying to Ettie that if she had to give Christmas presents , that was all right , but not to give them to his mother . He did n't say it . He knew that Ettie would resent it . For her Christmas presents to his parents were exactly what his mother took them for . Since this was so , nothing but a command could have made her leave off giving them . Amos was nobody to issue commands . And any roundabout plea for indulgence to an old woman would have been met by Ettie , as he foresaw , only with excited arguments and an injured air . Quakers , the old-fashioned Quakers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew why . She knew a lot of things nobody had ever told her , even though as yet she hardly knew she knew them . Quakers did n't celebrate Christ 's birthday any more than they celebrated their own birthdays . Every day should be the birthday of Christ . Every day should be your own birthday . It was not a matter of starting or stopping . It was a matter of continuous revitalization . " Lo , I am with you always . " But Virginia consciously knew some scientific reasons , also , because the Laceys had a scholar in the family , her great-uncle Eli . She had heard her mother ask him once why Quakers did n't pay any attention to Christmas , and had heard his exposition in reply . The way he put it , it was rather interesting , even to Virginia . Uncle Eli  | was not the president of Gurney College for nothing . Graceful little speeches on instructive subjects were a part of his job . Both of Grandfather Lacey 's brothers were fine-looking men . Uncle Dick was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Eli was only of average size , a scrawny neat old man , with a little pointed white beard and a manner of imperturbable twinkling dignity . There was something measured yet sprightly about him . He was said to have proposed to his wife in these words : " Elizabeth , does thee love me ? If so , why so ? If not , why not ? " Virginia used to look'at him and wonder how it was possible that he had once been stripped naked and tarred and feathered and ridden on a rail . And yet that very thing had happened to him . When he had graduated from the Friends ' Academy that was later Gurney College , he had elected to become a schoolteacher . The Civil War was over , and the Federal troops had just been withdrawn from the South . He had journeyed to the depths of Georgia to introduce the benighted Negro children to their ABC 's . In the war-disrupted hamlet of his choice there were no teachers for the white children . And although Uncle Eli offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , he began to get threatening letters from the Ku Klux Klan . When these had no effect , and the little blacks continued to be unwholesomely puffed up on McGuffey , Webster , and Ray , Uncle Eli was tarred and feathered and ridden on a rail one night . Some compassionate Negroes out in the country , where the white gentlemen had turned him loose , let him scour himself off in their wash kettle , and lent him some old quilts with which to cover his nakedness ; while one of them , at the risk of his own life , crept into the village the following night and fetched Uncle Eli his clothes and his carpet bag  --  detested symbol . Uncle Eli walked to the nearest town and took the first train North . He then taught English literature at Gurney till he became its president . Now in reply to that question about Christmas and the Quakers , Uncle Eli said , " Thee well might ask , Lucetta . " He made no bones about calling Ettie " thee . " " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear of this pagan festival . The Gospels say nothing whatever about the date of Christ 's birth , and the early Christians did not celebrate it . Not till the beginning of the fourth century , anno Domini , did the Western Church adopt the twenty-fifth of December as the true date . " He twinkled significantly as his voice , the voice of an experienced orator , italicized " true date . " And pausing at intervals to twinkle and italicize , he pleasantly damned the Roman Catholic Church by saying some  | very nice things about it  --  a method of argument which Virginia had already come to identify as typically Quaker , and which puzzled her extremely . Doing justice to all , he took a backward circuit and brought in the ancient Syrians , worked up again to St. Augustine and Pope Leo the Great , cut across Europe to the ancient Germans , and ended up by adding tolerantly , " Though I should never presume to criticize any man for his religion . There is a variety of gifts and capacities " ? thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very great gifts and capacities , like his , for instance . Virginia was particularly put out by his description of a Christmas tree . " That pretty , pretty tree , " he said , smiling at Ettie and . shaking his head at her , as if she had been a child whom he was gently parting from its toys ? " with its lights and its trinkets ! What is more probable than that it also is a relic of superstition ? " Ettie turned red and looked indignant . And even Virginia decided then that , though she liked her uncle Eli , and his learning was no doubt an honor to the family , she preferred her grandfather Lacey . Uncle Eli was too much like her grandmother Lacey , who submitted to be kissed and put her Christmas presents away in a drawer . Uncle Eli found abstruse reasons for Grandmother Lacey 's mole-like habits . It was Grandfather who kissed back , and remembering his " you , " said " Thank you , Luthetta , " and always wore his Christmas slippers when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt sure , would have enjoyed a Christmas tree . At this time Virginia never thought it queer that her grandfather Lacey was almost a wealthy man . When her own father said , " Well , I guess if Father sold out everything he 's got , he 'd be worth about a half a million dollars , " she did not share in that surprise recorded by Chateaubriand who , as she had happened to read in a book at home , arriving in Philadelphia and asking to be shown some Quakers , " the godly and sober descendants of William Penn , " had been told that " if I were curious to discover the lengths to which self-interest and business immorality could be carried , they would show me two Quakers trying to buy something of each other and to get the better of the deal " ? though she had felt a little insulted , at that . But , insulted or not , she had feared that this description only slightly exaggerated the fact . For she had recognized a wholly familiar flavor in Davey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negroes whistle while they picked cherries , so that they could n't eat any . She had heard Ettie asking Amos " why in the world Father  | Lacey ever married your mother . " As a boy Amos had absorbed the knowledge that some of the neighbors wondered too , and had answered themselves by assuming that his father had married his mother for the Craydock money . The respect and affection he thought he owed his mother had been maintained with difficulty in the face of this neighborhood opinion and in the face of his mother 's nature which seemed to confirm it , so that Ettie 's question always stabbed him in a sore spot . Seeing that it did , she also asked him who the girl was that Father Lacey had been in love with before he married . And when Amos answered in intense exasperation that , so far as he knew , there had n't been any such girl , Ettie always retorted , " Now Father Lacey told me that he was disappointed in love . " It was hard to imagine Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love . " It seemed more likely that Ettie , unable to believe that her father-in-law could have married for money alone , had invented that unhappy love affair in order to explain why he had married for money at all , a motive ordinarily beneath him ; and had translated her invention into an asserted fact so as to surprise the truth out of Amos , a technique she often used . Also , it plainly pleased her to brag that she was the confidante of her father-in-law . Amos worshiped his father ; but his father had revealed an intimate secret to Ettie , a disappointment in love , and had not revealed it to him . Hearing this dialogue between her mother and her father , with its hints of guilt and irregularity beneath the seemly surface of her grandfather 's life , Virginia was scared and uneasy once again . She had begun to take notice that , as between her parents , it was almost sure to be her mother who disclosed the skeletons in other people 's closets . And Virginia was early smitten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to everybody else 's character or the disgraceful side to her mother 's character ; and which to blame : the other people for their flaws , or her mother for always pointing them out . All such suggestions of sub-surface evil began to bring on a well-known pain , the same she felt about the Littletons and Charleses , as if she could n't trust herself to them , as if she could n't bear her whole weight on them for fear they might cave in underneath her . To this was added the pain of doubt as to the reality of this evil , which seemed to undermine the earth , and as to its nature , supposing it was real . A devil in a red union suit , complete with horns , tail , and pitchfork , is a Mardi Gras figure and no real devil . He is a joke or even an old friend , and children never see him . It is the nature of the Prince of Darkness ,  | the Old Boy himself , to be a shadowy horror , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in your face , whose reality you do indeed so slowly and reluctantly admit . When children see this devil out of the corners of their eyes , it is their mother to whom they run . There is a charmed circle around a mother . The devil ca n't come near her or anybody in her arms . But Virginia 's mother often said such things to her as this : " My back never has been right since I had you , " or " Before you were born , I only weighed a hundred and twenty pounds , and your father said I had the ankles of a thoroughbred . " Virginia did n't know that at her birth her mother had cast her off . But such speeches told her so . Far from running to her mother for reassurance , it was always her mother from whom she ran , as from darkness and pain . And it was her mother 's figure that she saw in all the uncertainty and cruelty around her . And if she could not run to her mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia 's father afflicted her with shame and pity . His good intentions were the pavement of her hell . There was Aunt Rowena , certainly , to whom Virginia was grateful for that very dependability she so often missed , Aunt Rowena in her triumph over evil and death . But Aunt Rowena was so old that she mostly loved the dying and the dead . It was the living Virginia wanted to be reassured about . She was terrified of death , but more concerned with life ; and it was no less terrifying . Until she had begun to notice those alarming conversations between her parents , she had taken it for granted that in her grandfather Lacey was something she could wholly trust . It had bulked large , though she saw him so seldom , and hardly knew him as compared with her grandfather Littleton . And it could never be old , and it entirely lacked Aunt Rowena 's quality of astringency . It was an immediate permeating sensation of rest and delight . She still felt it whenever she was near him . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely . It was as if she forgave him , and flew into his arms , and wept . Whatever his faults , whatever he had done in the past , she loved her grandfather Lacey . When she heard her mother saying those things , casting doubts on his perfection , she thought angrily and defiantly , " Well , I do n't care ! " But the real truth was that she did care . And she never quite forgave him . She was already older than her father . Amos took all hints that his father had married his mother for the Craydock money as a condemnation of his mother , implying that there was nothing else about her worth marrying . Because he loved his father , his father  | was beyond suspicion . In all his life Amos never divided love and perfection . When he loved a person , that person was perfect because Amos insisted on his justifying his own judgment and preference . And when , in spite of all self-persuasions , Amos found out the faults of a person he loved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amos was what is known as loyal . And " loyalty " has a ring of fealty and feudality . " The King can do no wrong . " Like Sarah Jane , Amos was still the subject of a sovereign . But Virginia was not loyal . " I do believe , Virginia , " her mother said , " that you would criticize your own grandmother . " And this was literally true . It was true of Ettie also . What was not true of Ettie was that she could love what she criticized . Nobody but Littletons could do anything right , and Ettie conceived of herself as belonging to a reigning house . But it was often true of Virginia that she could love what she criticized . And in this she was older than her mother also . A born Protestant and citizen does not repudiate either God or government because he reserves the right to criticize their works . If she had not loved her grandfather , some stories she heard about him would not have distressed her . Since it was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a horse , any horse you bought from Robert Lacey was sure to have a rope halter on it . " This was not told and retold to accuse him of meanness , but in tickled approval of sharp trading ; and Virginia 's father was tickled by it , quite naturally and without wondering why . But Virginia was not tickled . She often heard about a balky horse her grandfather had bought for thirty-five dollars . He had trained it by whipping it around the barn lot with one of its legs tied up , and then , untying its leg , had sold it for a hundred and fifty dollars . But as often as she heard this , she failed to laugh . She - did n't like one of her father 's favorite anecdotes about her grandfather . This always ended severely , " And Father said to him , Jake Quackenbush , if thee worked as hard as I work , and I did n't work any harder than thee does , I 'd be begging thee to renew the note . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with amusement in which she did not share : " Robert does business according to the Gospel : Whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have more abundance ; but whosoever bath not , from him shall be taken away even that which he bath . ' " And she felt none of the malice or approval with which her mother then chimed in with the old Quaker 's maxim : " My son , make money ; honestly if thee can ; but anyway make money . ' " She was well enough acquainted with the moral standards of  | Quakers to appreciate the incongruity of such business practices , the incongruity at the bottom of most humor . But she did n't want to laugh at her grandfather . Since she knew nothing about making her own living , she could not feel the neighborhood 's sense of vindication in her grandfather 's character : that of an extremely prosperous man who was nevertheless a pattern of virtue  --  the Christian businessman by main strength . His ways of making money , that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craw , like the hateful side to her grandmother Littleton 's nature , like Aunt Rowena 's ghoulish preoccupation with the macabre and the moribund . Born into an autumnal time and place , Virginia had been born , it seemed , with a sense of parting from what was past and a halfsad half-eager expectation of some imminent future , such as the birds must feel on those last golden evenings as they gather to fly south . She wanted to take these people she loved into her future with her . And for one reason or another , she kept on finding out that she would have to leave them all behind . Love held her back and stretched her heart almost to breaking as something pulled her forward . Was it truth ? At least she had begun to develop a judgment of her own . More modestly stated , maybe it was honesty . But whatever it was , it made her lonelier and lonelier . And though she was only nine years old , this loneliness of hers was not childlike at all . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find foster parents , she turned to herself . She began to grow up before her time . Still she loved her grandfather Lacey . And because all signs of money were lacking in his appearance and his house , money was not what she predominantly connected with him . What he mainly meant to her was her unformulated but deeply felt conviction that some actuality in him , some portion of his life , was bound to correspond to that sensation of rest and delight she still felt in his presence . Maybe he had been disappointed in love . Who could tell ? As so often happened , when the truth or falsity of some fact rested on Ettie 's testimony alone , all anybody could learn about it was what she preferred to assert . But the less dubious fact remained that Robert Lacey had married Sarah Jane Craydock , who was so inferior to him in every way that he had probably married her , not for herself , but for something else . And what could that have been except the Craydock money ? An even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing was totally unlike the Robert Lacey anybody currently knew . The old-timers were dead and gone , those who could have pro  | nounced judgment on the Robert Lacey who had been a boy , growing up when and where to " get ahead " was all ten of the commandments , when and where money was virtue , and the Yankee typified all admirable achievement ; a boy who was a Quaker and therefore historically predisposed himself to have a go at the needle 's eye , and a young man who had married when he was exactly twenty-one . What you do at twenty-one is often what at forty you wish to God you had n't done . And yet it can never be undone . It ca n't even be cut short if it is marriage , and the date is 188o , and you have had children meanwhile , and are a Quaker anyway , with an abhorrence of divorce going deeper than any conventional abhorrence belonging to the period . Therefore , since the circumstances you repent of ca n't be changed , repentance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realization of your own fault is the only grounds for tolerating the faults of other people . And then the second chance , the knowledge that you are still capable of good , in spite of all the evil in you , is grounds for something better than toleration . Faced with the inclination to hate his wife , his children , and the whole world , Virginia 's grandfather had had to love them . In pain and sorrow , he had had to refuse all anaesthetics . He had to bestir himself so as not to commit the injustice of inflicting his pain and sorrow on other people . Disposed to blame the circumstances and those other people , he had to admit the truth , accept those people for what they were , and cease to argue against the past for having happened as it did . He had to accept even his own responsibility , not so much as it regarded himself , but as regarding those others . He had to shift himself from the center of his universe to its periphery , after the example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do this as the only alternative to murder and death . He had to do it to save the lives of other people and himself . But this was the choice that took great courage . The courage to murder and the courage to die were nothing by comparison . Life is the tough assignment . Robert Lacey had not given his life for Negroes or criminals or others of his time who were considered inferior in a public sense , as some of his own relatives had done , as in his country it had become almost the Quaker job to do . Public beneficence is doubtless better than its opposite . But it is patently noble and relatively easy . Virginia 's grandfather had given his life for that stupid , spiteful , self-drowned little woman , Sarah Jane , and for their children , four of whom were discouragingly like her . During the forty-eight years of his married life , he had given his very self , not  | for anything obviously glorious , but for something which , on the face of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persisted in this effort every day was his living testimony that mere humanness demanded of him all he had to give . He had come to love Sarah Jane , his wife , and their five children with all the warmth and tenderness he had . He had accomplished a mighty work . Virginia was right to believe , in spite of everything , that her grandfather Lacey was a great man . In him existed the very thing she was looking for , the reconciliation of the two great needs of her life , love and truth . He had found out how to love people in spite of the truth about them , like Aunt Rowena , no matter how much it hurt . This indeed was how Virginia loved her aunt Rowena and her grandfather . Yes , but , as always , she knew a great deal more than she knew she knew . And it seemed to her that the truth about a thing always showed her the part she could not love . She forgot that it also showed her what she loved . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her any more than they themselves had discovered it at the age of nine . Like them , Virginia had to learn it , she had to come to know she knew it , the hard way . She had to live it out . And though this gradual realization was her growing up and catching up with history , she had to begin to grow up by turning , not to Aunt Rowena and not to Grandfather Lacey , but to herself . She was still a little girl in spite of her precocity . In her survived the conviction all children are born with : that nothing bad or ugly is real , as if before their birth they have been promised nothing but goodness and beauty . She had been cast forth on this earth in the full expectation that earth was heaven , so that the truth seemed like one anguished disappointment after another . It was a long while before she was able to look at the same spot on the same planet , and see that the truth about it had been also good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that everything may always be better . But Virginia still expected perfection in her God and her Eden . Still ? She had prematurely acquired the sophomoric characteristic of disillusionment . She turned away , weeping and angry , whenever she found that nothing was cut to fit her personal requirements . She had to be a rebel first . And as a matter of fact , forgiveness at her age and for years to come would have been as bad as pride . Both would have left her sticking in her own past . That she could not be proud of much the truth displayed , that she could not forgive it , was exactly what compelled her to go on growing . It was what allowed of hope . If there  | was hope for Virginia , it resided in her humiliations and her disappointments . Perfection is not possible because it would be the dead end . Life would stop there . When the lion and the lamb lie down together , it will be in happy death  --  as Virginia knew , having heard it somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so her very love of her grandfather was a discomfort . She did not forgive him . She saw him , the idol of his time , a Christian businessman , as a self-contradiction , not a synthesis . No matter how kind he was to his family , she thought he should have been kinder to the Jake Quackenbushes , and should not have turned them out of house and home when they could not pay on the dot . She felt that he was too much shut up in his private life and his religion , though not as much as Uncle Eli and Grandmother Lacey , as if only his family and the Quakers had any claims on him . And she missed in him and his surroundings the exuberance , the color , the noise , the flavors , the passions of life outside that small white house , life as it was lived by Littletons and Charleses . Those might not be very good things , as Quakers saw them . They might better be avoided , as Quakers avoided them . But Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to her , when it was stored away for private consumption , like potatoes in a cellar , and other people went hungry  --  when those potatoes had even been taken from the other people . There was a rather ugly parallel between Grandfather Lacey 's goodness and his business practices : He turned the Quackenbushes out of house and home so that his own children could go to college . Surely , that was n't right ? And what did it matter how much money he gave to Gurney College and Stillwater Meeting when you thought how he had got it ? Surely , his goodness did n't go far enough ? Just as Virginia thought that Grandfather Lacey would have enjoyed a Christmas tree , so she thought he had it in him to love people who were not members of his family or of the Society of Friends  --  that he was the loser for being shut away from outside life . And certainly those outsiders were the losers for not knowing Grandfather Lacey , except as a sharp trader and a businessman . For , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all truth something to worship , beyond anything else Virginia had ever found ; and , with reservations , she worshiped it , not knowing what she worshiped , but seeing a light , and feeling a warmth , and hearing a voice , as she might have recognized the presence of an angel .  | It was Grandfather Lacey , in his character of angel , who blamed Virginia 's mother  --  for what she could n't make out  --  and demanded of her what she did not have to give , who made her twist and flounce in her chair as if she sat on a hot griddle . But it was Grandfather Lacey , in the same angelic character , who warmed the others and drew them together . They put up with one another because they loved him . Aunt Zelda and Grandmother Lacey could hardly even put up with each other  --  partly because Zelda , like Ettie , had not been born a Quaker , but for other reasons , too . Zelda complained that she and Hank , of all the others  --  Amos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones who had to stay there on the farm and work their fingers to the bone . She said that Henry , as she called her husband , was nothing more than Father Lacey 's hired man , and that she herself might as well be Mother Lacey 's hired girl . Had n't Mother Lacey always had a girl before ? Still , though Zelda fretted , she was an excellent housekeeper , very neat and quick . Sarah Jane was neat but slow . In the kitchen where the two of them had to work together , she nearly drove Zelda wild with her deliberate maddening motions , dazedly drifting from table to stove , always silent , winking one eyelid now and then in that reflective catlike way she had , licking her thumbs , for she was always hungry . Under Zelda 's eye , she often spilled things or dropped them or let them burn . Then Zelda would say , " For heaven sakes ! Why ca n't you let me do it ? I have n't had a plain boiled potato in weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do your work around here if he ca n't get decent meals ? " When Robert Lacey sat there against the dining room wall , both Zelda and Sarah Jane restrained themselves . They felt comparatively soothed and cheered , and a little ashamed of their emotions . As Robert became more crippled , his one expedition out of doors was to the mailbox . But the walk down the road took him a long time . And it was during his absences that Zelda usually burst out at her mother-in-law . Dreading this , it was then that Sarah Jane disgraced herself the oftenest . One day , while he was gone , she dropped a dish and broke it . When he came back , he found her in her low rocking chair , bent over and shaking uncontrollably , with her apron thrown over her head , and both hands pressed to her shrouded face . Zelda , out in the kitchen , was stepping about and rattling pans at a great rate . After that incident Robert never left the house again . Hank walked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother also put up with each other , but also with difficulty . All her life , Miriam had wanted to be a college professor like her aunt Miriam Lacey . Her aunt had had a brilliant  | mind and that pervasive charm that was a Lacey characteristic . Miriam had the charm but not the mind . And yet , when she had graduated from Gurney , her father had let her go with her cousin , Uncle Eli 's daughter , to Bryn Mawr for further schooling . Two summers later , Uncle Eli and his wife and daughter went abroad , and her father let Miriam go with them . When she arrived in Germany , Miriam liked that country so well that she stayed there for four whole years . She came home with a German twist to her sentences , and a love of Wagner , and the news that Ibsen existed , and a trunkful of French underclothes . And Hank and J. J. and Ernie grumbled to think how much money those two years at Bryn Mawr and those four years in Germany had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Only Amos reserved judgment because his father could do no wrong . Miriam had been repeatedly engaged , but it looked as if she were never going to marry ; and this was the probability that caused ill feeling between her and her mother . It was not that Sarah Jane wanted her to marry . She had once told Miriam she hoped she never did . " I 've never had a happy day in my life since I was married , " Sarah Jane had said . But neither did she want a college professor for a daughter . Because she had felt in awe of the other Miriam , the graduate of Oberlin , the Latin professor at Gurney , she had detested her . All her husband 's family , she thought , " liked to be big . " They were all too brilliant or too charming or too successful . They should have been content with nullity and void like hers . She did n't want her only daughter to teach German . She wanted a daughter she could feel at ease with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could stay at home and help her mother wash the dishes . When Miriam came home , she helped to wash the dishes . But it was not her mother , it was her father , whom she came to see . Joseph John , " J. J. , " was devoted to his father who had set him up in business after business , and repeatedly paid his debts . And Ernie , the youngest , a small and handsome youth , had been expelled from Gurney and reinstated only because his father was on the board of trustees and his uncle Eli was then president . All the Laceys loved their father . All of them bickered among themselves . A favorite laudatory expression of Amos 's was : " So-and-so is a big man " or " a big woman . " Virginia , understanding that he did not refer to physical size , wondering what he did mean , and catching sight of this meaning in her grandfather Lacey , had come to think of Grandfather Lacey as , above all , having size . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilted them by disregarding them . He pricked their bloatedness with a glance from his sharp eyes . The pushing pathetic little egos became one in him because he loved them . And yet to love them was to forgive more than any man should have had to forgive in his own family . He himself , who had married for money , could be the great man Virginia took him for by main strength . But his children were not altogether his . They were partly their mother 's , too . And inevitably they were not as strong as he was . When it came to her grandmother Lacey and all her Lacey uncles  --  yes , and her own father  --  Virginia saw with shrinking and distaste what miserable little people they were . She was afraid of this grandmother and this grandmother reincarnated , not as she feared the Pennsylvania Dutch and their reincarnations in the Charleses and the Littletons , for Kuntz , though a coward and a bully , was a strong and positive evil . Kuntz , too , had size . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than her father , she almost liked her mother . Her mother had strength and ability , though these had both turned sour somewhere , somehow , and served her only for poisoning herself and everybody near her . It was an evil so petty and helpless that you were almost ashamed to hate it , which Virginia feared in her grandmother Lacey , and therefore hated all the more . There is always hope for strength and ability . But you have to hope indeed for weakness and insufficiency . Perhaps it seemed to Grandfather Lacey that his family looked at him with eyes of reproach . Perhaps because he thought himself there was so little hope , he helped them too much , trying to supply their lacks by giving himself to them . Nothing could have been a sadder sight . Since Sarah Jane was too timid to go into the city stores , and too sluggish to make the effort , he bought the household supplies , he bought the very material for her dresses , and ordered her bonnets , when he went to town ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listless words of criticism and disappointment . Among his children he must have hoped more for Miriam than for any of the others . People said she was the most like him . She looked like him , with her prematurely white hair and her shining black eyes , except that her handsome face led you to expect her to be tall like her father ; and it was a disappointment , when she stood up , to see how short she was . And yet she taught German only in Quaker colleges because , even out West , it meant something among Quakers to be her father 's daughter and her uncle Is ; 1F  | Eli 's niece . It meant that she was fairly certain of getting any place she applied for , and gave her a seeming independence after she had got it . Seeing that no necessity obliged her to adapt her behavior to the conditions , she was always between positions , and as likely as not at Grandfather Lacey 's , whatever the season . There was something the matter with every place she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one term 's trial . But once the situation had taken a different turn . Out in a little college town in Iowa one of the professors had been walking down the street one evening , when through the dusk he had noticed a grocery wagon driving past . Two people were sitting on its lowered tailgate , male and female figures . Their legs were dangling , and they were eating apples . The professor , making a mental note to take up the unseemly conduct of the student body at the next faculty meeting , had looked closer to identify the guilty , and had seen that the female was the associate professor of German , and that the male was one of her pupils . Virginia adored her aunt Miriam because she had done this awful thing , and because she was so beautiful and charming , and because she bought her clothes in Paris , just as her pupils always adored her . It was unbelievable that she could be a German teacher . Nevertheless she was saved from the worst consequences of that escapade , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , only because of her father 's , intercession . None of the Laceys had their father 's intelligence . But of all his family , excepting Sarah Jane , Hank was the dullard . He was no brighter than his mother . Nothing much could be done for Hank . The best thing possible had been done when his father had asked him to come and live with him and manage the farms , however much Zelda complained of this arrangement . For he and Zelda had been living until then as tenants on one of those very farms . And when , a few years later , Zelda had pneumonia , and the doctor recommended a change of climate , Father Lacey sent both her and Hank to Arizona for a year , with all expenses paid . As for Amos , his father had given him a one-third share in Uncle Dick 's milk business to start him off in adult life , and now had begun to doubt if Amos would ever make a businessman . It was her father in whom Virginia feared her grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base-burner apparently , but around Grandfather Lacey actually , those Sunday afternoons , it could be seen that Grandmother Lacey , poor soul , in her low rocking chair ,  | framed by the sunny window as by a floral border , was more in need of such warmth and inclusion than anybody . Sarah Jane 's children loved their father . Sarah Jane 's grandchildren always went to their grandfather . She had never betrayed her jealousy but once . That once , as Virginia climbed up on her grandfather 's lap , Grandmother Lacey had glanced that way , flapped her hand , and said , " Ah-h ! " disgustedly . All the other Laceys had laughed . But their laughter had been the kind that is determined to take a dreadful thing as humorous . For there was nobody to tell Sarah Jane that only if she had loved her children and her grandchildren would they have loved her . Usually she did not seem to notice as Virginia went and got the Brownie Book and laid it on Grandfather Lacey 's knee , giving him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and began to read . Most of their relatives had read to the children at one time or another . But their mother had not done so since they had been able to read for themselves . And though their father had read to them for a time of Sunday evenings , as if he thought it would be nice if they could all enjoy themselves that way , they had not enjoyed themselves . One of the sets in the bookcases at their house was the complete works of James Whitcomb Riley . One of the volumes in the set was a long poem whose climax came when Santa Claus set his beard on fire from the candles on the Christmas tree , and a kind friend took him out and rolled him in the snow . " Now roll ! ' he said . Hi , rolly O ! ' " And at these words , Benjamin never failed to weep . They acted on him as surely as a powerful purge or an emetic . And that poem was a favorite selection of his father 's for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another favorite book of Amos 's was The Bears of Blue River , a series of yarns about a boy who had lived in the Middle West when it was still frontier country . The incidental properties , the log cabin with the boys ' beds in the loft and the parents ' bed in the lower room , built out on poles from the log walls , the wooden water bucket and gourd dipper on the bench beside the door , the savage watch dogs , the little clearing in the midst of the big woods , and the bears that lived in the woods , belonged to a time Amos could not remember , but which his parents remembered , and which delighted his soul . The last story was about a bear that lived in a cave where natural gas escaped . The gas had impregnated the bear 's coat ; so that when the boy was exploring the cave , his torch ignited the gas , and the bear caught fire , and rushed at him with its fur all blazing . Every time Amos read this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever wept over Santa Claus 's disaster . It terrified him . Once Amos took Virginia upstairs to the bathroom to finish the story . The Laceys ' bathroom was their place of retirement for private colloquy . But soon Ettie had come rapping on the door panels with her wedding rings , and had made Amos and Virginia come down again . Added to Benjamin 's inconvenient propensity to weep were Virginia 's suspicions that her father read hopefully and ceremoniously , doing an imitation of his own father , and not quite sure how good an imitation he was . Virginia felt sorry for her father . Her pity shaded into shame . At the age of seven or eight , to pity your own father is a peculiarly embarrassing experience . And she had been only relieved when those Sunday evening readings had died a natural death . The children had been read to impatiently by their Littleton aunts . And some of their teachers at school read to the class in a kindergarten way , like perfect fools . Their grandfather Lacey alone read to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so amazed Virginia and Benjamin , and pleased them so much , that his readings in the Brownie Book and the Brownie Book itself ( extremely infantile for their taste , if the truth had been known ) were unique entertainments . When he had finished The Brownies in January , The Brownies in February , and maybe The Brownies in March , their grandfather would say , " Now , Benjamin , you read to me . " Everybody else , too , fell silent to hear Benjamin read . He stood up straight , holding the book in both hands , as he had been taught in school , with his goldrimmed glasses bent earnestly over the page , and spoke out in a clear precise voice , easily managing such words as these : For never since that house first stood On its foundations firm and good , Was such a scene enacted there Of dances round and dances square ; Strange dances that are only seen In Asiatic groves , I ween . A murmur of admiration went around the family ; and Aunt Miriam would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eighth grade that could n't pronounce Asiatic . ' " And Uncle Hank would ask , with his foolish grin and his lisp , " What duth enacted ' mean , Benjamin ? " " Just about the same as acted , ' only like a play , " Benjamin  | would answer , cocking an eye at him ; though he had never seen a play . " Well , I gueth that'th a pretty good anther ! " Uncle Hank would say . He himself did not feel capable of judging . He alone of all the five had never gone to college . He had had a hard time getting through the Pigeon Ford High School . The children 's father smiled tremulously , and their mother beamed and thrust out her bosom . Virginia stood by . Nobody ever asked her to read out loud from the Brownie Book . Of course she was older , and the fact that she could do as well was not so impressive . But nobody had ever asked her to at any age . Benjamin had the fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those Sunday afternoons , when Benjamin had finished reading so excellently well from the Brownie Book , she said glumly , " That 's Professor Lacey , " and everybody laughed . " Well , now , you know , " said Uncle Hank , " I would n't be thurprithed if Virginia wath jutht about right about that . " " I think myself that Benjamin may turn out to be a college professor or something of the sort , " said Ettie proudly . " Well , it runs in the blood ! " said Amos with equal pride , thinking of his aunt Miriam and his uncle Eli . But his sister Miriam thought he meant her , and laughed in deprecation . " Oh , I 'll never get to be a professor , " she said . " Well ! Maybe Benjamin will make a lawyer ! " Ettie said quickly , hearing the conversation taking a trend in favor of the Lacey side . " James Gaynor Brooks used to say to me , when he came to call on Grandmother Charles , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know yet but what that 's what I should ' a ' done ! " She turned to Miriam . " James Gaynor Brooks , the Median lawyer , you know . He and my grandmother Charles used to be great chums . Oh , she was a bright old woman ! " " She was a fine old lady , " said Amos in hearty agreement ? with uncalled-for heartiness and uncalled-for agreement , his sister Miriam thought . " James Gaynor Brooks used to say to me when I was just a tot , We 'll have to make a lawyer out of this young lady . ' So maybe we 'll make a lawyer out of Benjamin . School teaching for a man sounds like a little too much of a sissy to me ! " Ettie ended triumphantly . She had finally figured out how to get in a retaliatory jab . And Amos unsuspectingly reinforced it , thinking to point out to her a slip in tact , and giving her the chance to retrieve it .  | He said , smiling at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you ? " But Ettie shrugged her shoulders and laughed . " Well ! I do n't know ! " she said . Miriam turned pink . However , she said pleasantly enough , " It 's all settled , I see , that Benjamin 's not going into the milk company . Amos is the only member of the firm that has a son . " " Oh , it would be a mistake to try to put Benjamin in the creamery ! " Ettie cried . And Amos said quietly , plucking at his under lip , " Yes , I can see that right now . " For it was pathetic , in a way , that both Ettie and Amos considered Benjamin 's talents of too high an order for a businessman ? Ettie because she had never outgrown the Littleton contempt for " barter , " even though she depended on it for her livelihood , and recognized its indispensability if you wanted to " be somebody " and " hold up your head " in present society ; Amos because he thought of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . Benjamin puzzled him . He felt no more capable of judging what was best for him than Uncle Hank of judging what " en . acted " meant , and this though he worshiped his father , and his father was a businessman . Amos shared the profound uneasy suspicion of his generation that there was something low about business . He was like the multimillionaires of his day who tried to subsidize the things of the spirit . Their money was worth that much , they seemed to say ; and Amos likewise planned to spend his money to buy Benjamin the best education going . At the same time , in spite of his genuine humility , Amos resented Benjamin 's mental abilities as heartily as his mother had resented those of her sister-in-law , the Latin professor . Virginia was conscious of her father 's rather wistful preference for her , but realizing that it was based on her bounden inferiority as a girl , rejected it with sickened feelings . Miriam was siding with Amos when she turned smilingly toward Benjamin and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream . Do n't you ? " " He surely does , " said Ettie . " Uncle Dick says he 's going to put him in the window . " Hearing the words " Uncle Dick , " Sarah Jane said , " Ruth thinks she 's got it now . But I 've always had it . " Then she looked up in that quick scared way , tittered , and clapped one hand across her mouth .  | When everybody had smiled upon her , general conversation was resumed . Ettie frowned at Miriam . " But , Miriam ! " she said . " You have n't any conception of what it means to be a milk man . " In speaking of Amos in relation to his occupation , she always calla ! him a milk man , giving this expression a strange shading of dig nity and hauteur . " Up with the birds ? ! At it all day ? ! W'y. sometimes Amos do n't get home till eight o'clock at night . Sun days as well as Mondays ? ! Except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( This was not true . Amos spent more free Sundays at the Littletons ' than at the Laceys ' . ) " No , thank you ! One milk man in the family is a plenty . " Miriam turned pink again . But fortunately Virginia here broke in . " He 's going to be an archeologist , " said Virginia , still looking at Benjamin . For Benjamin loved to pore over the National Geographic magazines . He longed to be an archeologist , and go digging in strange ruins . And this announcement of Virginia 's was the cruel betrayal of his inmost secret . Virginia had been standing there , thinking that nobody ever discussed what she was going to be when she grew up . She had heard Uncle Marmion predict that she would be a heartbreaker , but she did not consider heartbreaking an elevated profession . Benjamin looked at her steadily . He was hurt . His eyes began to blink and his chin to quiver . There was no responsive laughter from Virginia 's relatives this time . Though they could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to weep . " Now that 's enough , Virginia ! " said her mother . " I 'd be it ashamed ! You and Benjamin go play with the croquinole board . And , Virginia ! " she screamed as they left the dining room . Ettie never called anybody . She always screamed . " Virginia ! Now listen to me . You 're going to play fair with him . Do you hear ? No cheating ! I do n't want to hear any Mother , mother ! Sis is cheating me ! ' " She imitated Benjamin 's familiar appeal , and then everybody laughed . But Virginia thought her relatives looked at her with disfavor , too . " What a bad girl ! " she thought they must be saying to themselves . " She cheats her little brother ! " Her grandfather 's bright black eyes were turned upon her . " Virginia , " he said , " when thee was  --  when you were  --  a little girl , and came out here to see us , one Sunday , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talking to you  --  and I guess we had n't paid much attention to Benjamin just yet . And I recollect you said , ' Benny 's here ! ' " Her grandfather smiled at her . And that small story and that  | smile caught Virginia unawares . Was that how she used to feel about Benny ? And so she resolved that if she should cheat him at croquinole , just supposing she should , she would do it so smoothly that he would never know . As she sat cross-legged on the floor , flipping the little wooden doughnuts down the croquinole board , sucking her aching fingernail between shots , she heard her mother in the dining room saying apologetically , " Just give Virginia an audience ! That 's all she needs . I never saw a child love the limelight the way she does . She 'd say anything to attract a little attention . " But then Virginia heard her grandfather begin to tell jokes and stories . Rounds of laughter resounded , with her mother 's shrill mirthless whinny high above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded with other stories . And good will and human solidarity began to radiate from the dining room where a cold snap had threatened to set in a few minutes before . Glancing through the connecting doorway , she could see her grandfather sitting against the wall , with his thumbs hooked into the top of his trousers , smiling in his cottony beard , and talking with compelling charm . Till Great-grandfather Craydock had died , he and the Laceys had all lived together in this house that he had built . He still lived there in Grandfather Lacey 's stories . From her father Virginia had gathered that her great-grandfather Craydock had been a formidable old giant , grim and grasping . For the contemplation of such qualities in a relative exhilarated Amos and reassured him . But Grandfather Lacey 's anecdotes made of Great-grandfather Craydock a much more appealing character , a man who had believably built this house in which Virginia was at present sitting . In his younger days , when he had been an undefeated wrestler , a rival giant and contender for the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Amos Craydock , I hear you been tellin ' folks around here that I 'm a lazy loafer . " Great-grandfather Craydock had answered , " Friend , I do n't ever recollect saying so . But I 'm bound to admit that that has always been my opinion . " Then they had peeled off their coats . Not long afterward , Great-grandfather Craydock had " wrassled " a young man in Enoch Mendenhall 's blacksmith shop , and had thrown him against a pile of old iron in one corner . The young man had been crippled for life , and Great-grandfather Craydock had never wrassled again . He had also given up chewing tobacco and swearing so as not to  | set a bad example for his grandsons . But old Mary Ferguson ' geese had come swimming down the creek " once too often . " They came down into the Craydock place and set up housekeepins , there , and Great-grandfather Craydock always had to carry them home . " Well , this had been going on a good many years , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your grandfather Craydock got a little out of patience toward the last . The last time he took them home , they were all ready for roasting , or so I heard . " At this point Virginia 's father would say , " Well , I 'll never forget about Old Joe and the jugs . You never would scold any of us , Father . All you ever said was , I feel sorry for any boy that ca n't do better than that ' " Grandfather Lacey smiled a little in his beard . " But any of us would rather ' a ' taken a licking than fall down on a job you had told us to do . And that time , in harvest , when you sent me to the house with Old Joe to get the water jugs , and Old Joe kicked up ? " Virginia 's father smiled in pained grimace and shook his head . " He was the meanest horse ! " said Aunt Miriam . " I can just barely remember him . And you cried . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Well , he kicked off the jugs ! " said Amos . " And there they were , all broke to smithereens , and the water running all over the ground . I 'll never forget , " he always added with great feeling , " how Grandfather Craydock come along , and took Old Joe by the halter , and said , ' I do n't see why in thunder Robert wants to keep a horse like that anyway ! ' And three or four months later , he made you sell him , Father . Is n't that right ? " " That 's right , " Grandfather Lacey would say . But he would say it as if there were something in this story of his son 's he did n't quite like . Then her father would tell about the vicious horses he had subdued in his time . " So I just gethered me a shillelagh ? " he would say . He liked to tell , too , how he had salted the cattle by putting the salt on the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and take a lick , " he would say with consummate enjoyment in the memory , " and the old turtle would shoot out his head and nab her tongue and hang on . And the old cow would elevate her caudal appendage ? " Here , her father , overcome , would laugh till he cried . He was usually unable to finish the story , that delicate scientific expression seemed so overwhelmingly funny to him . His laughter broke out from between his firmed-up lips in little helpless snorts , and the tears seeped from his eyes . The  | others laughed too , but out of kindness , it seemed to Virginia . She herself never thought her father 's stories were very funny . A consistent strain ran through them , which she did n't like , which she could see her grandfather did n't like either . And these rural reminiscences of her husband 's always annoyed Ettie . She said sharply , " Well ! I 'm afraid I 'd never ' a ' made a pioneer ! " She said it , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laceys ' flesh crawl : " Well ! Ah 'm afraid Ah 'd nevah ' a ' made a pioneeuh ! " Though Ettie 's grandfather Littleton had worn black broadcloth and a stock for every day , and her father had never done a lick of real work in his life , she had grown up only five or six miles away , amid surroundings much inferior to the Laceys ' . The cool silence which fell at once was usually the signal for rising and getting the wraps and starting home . It was always a good excuse that Amos hated driving in the dark . That was the signal , too , for ending the croquinole game . And Virginia sometimes found that , giggling at her grandfather 's stories , reassured by the genial truce , the treve de Dieu that they created among the warring factions , she had , contrary to her rule , let Benjamin beat her . She and Benjamin and their father were always wrapped and ready , waiting in the yard , while her mother laughed and talked inside the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always let loose in her a paroxysm of cordiality . Virginia and Benjamin , hunched up in their navy blue " chinchilla " coats , wandered out to the front gate where their father stood talking with Uncle Hank . Down the lane , the old barn was silhouetted against the orange streaks of sunset . Virginia knew that inside it had a double row of horse stalls stretching out so far that the aisles were almost like streets . But only four or five horses were kept in it any more . She looked through the orchard at the big cow barn with the silo attached . Uncle Hank kept up Grandfather Lacey 's dairy herd . The cows had an elegant cement trench under their tails . Very fine and unusual was the milking machine run by a racketing back-firing gasoline engine in a small red shed . Uncle Hank and her father loitered near the front gate ; and Uncle Hank was wondering how soon he could change his clothes and get at his milking . But he and her father maintained a social conversation . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legithlature ? " said Uncle Hank . " Minimum butterfat content ! I gueth a dairyman with Holthteinth might ath well thell out . " The Lacey cows were Holsteins . They gave more milk than any other kind of cows , but the milk was blue and watery .  | " A-a-h ! " said her father , screwing up his face . " It 's like the Board of Health . Not a week goes by that we do n't have one of those fellas in the place , pokin ' his nose in what do n't concern him . The government 's tellin ' you how to run your business now ! " Virginia was beginning to shiver . She wished her mother would hurry . The old pine tree they were standing under began to wave its few remaining limbs away up near its top . It flung them out like wings against the cold gray sky of evening and made a moaning sound . " That'th about gone , " said Uncle Hank , looking up . " The nexth big wind is gon na take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , anyway , I gueth . " Virginia looked up . Once more , as when she held the conch shell over her ear and " heard the ocean , " she heard other things as well . The moaning of the wind in the old pine sounded through her as if she herself had been a shell , far from the ocean , but still holding all its mighty body in her self . " Oh-h-h ! " moaned the pine , and flung out its arms , and released Virginia 's soul upon the seas of evening . It was telling her the answers to urgent questions she could not even shape in her mind . " A long way off ! " said the pine tree . " Keep on going ! " Then the right-hand front door flew open and Ettie burst out on a gust of cordiality . Grandfather Lacey was holding open the door . Virginia hastily climbed into the front seat of the Garvin , before Benjamin could get ahead of her . She leaned out and waved . " Good-by ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand at her . The tree of life does not grow in Eden . Successive Edens , like successive seasons , grow in it . If it could ever be cut down , every ring inside its trunk would be found to commemorate an Eden . For Eden is a cycle of growth . The tree itself is the total contexture of events , a great dark growth , with stars for its blossoms and worlds for its fruit , coiling out of that " original " seed and egg and womb . Somewhere between speculation and fact , Virginia Lacey had always been alive in it , as a flame , a vapor , a liquid crystal , a microscopic gelatinous blob floating in a warm salt puddle , a jelly fish , a vertebrate fish , an amphibian  --  a sort of frog perhaps , whose five-fingered hands she still retained , and then a special sort of ape . This was her prehistory whose middle stages she had re-enacted  | inside her mother 's womb . She was not wholly human after she was born  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and write . It had taken her seven years to learn to do these things , a long time in which to learn a little , compared with all she had learned in nine prenatal months . Still this had been quick work , too . In these seven years she had re-enacted uncounted ages in which an ape on all fours became a Phoenician and invented the alphabet . After that , when her memories could be written down , was when her history began . And after that , when she was seven , she slowed up more and more . In a sense , everything before that time had done most of her work for her . Thenceforward she had to do most of it herself . And yet it is not reasonable to suppose that she stopped altogether . What is growing up if it is not catching up with history ? Virginia was as ignorant of her origins as any leaf on any tree . And yet , unlike any other form of life , she wondered about them . The stories she read in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had churned the universe like butter out of the milk of space and how Eros had begotten it out of love , satisfied her deep longing to know where she had come from . So did the story she learned in Sunday school : how God had created the world in six days . Yet one of her first important acts of judgment was to place these stories side by side and wonder if they all three were not stories merely ; and to feel a secret exultation in this act of defiance and blasphemy . She had a hunch that the answer she was looking for was no longer in them . As for those other concomitant questions , " Where am I going ; what should I do in the meantime ? " ? the answers to those were that she was going to heaven , and that in the meantime she had to obey God and her parents , with some vague reference to Moses and the ten commandments and Jesus and the beatitudes . These answers were there to satisfy her longing to know before she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her either . For some reason inherent in herself , she did not quite believe them . This critical ability to examine and compare and form conclusions grew as she grew . And since , from the first , much of what she found around her was terrifying and saddening and alienating , she saw herself walking about beneath the tree of life , looking at it from a critical distance , faintly aware that here and now were not everywhere and forever , but feeling , too , that her parents and her God had decreed them to be immutable  --  and therefore nourishing , in spite of her love and attachment to other things ,  | that secret excitement of rebellion . In her tradition , rebellion was associated with Lucifer and the Old Serpent and Adam and Eve . Still , Lucifer was the Bearer of Light , and Adam and Eve were the first human parents ; and in her tradition also those other limbs of Satan , Martin Luther and George Fox , were associated with a return to Jesus Christ himself , the greatest rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she did not know , childhood had been the murder of the parent since the spawning of the Milky Way , and in her spiritual history , which she was beginning to learn , she was the descendant of such a long distinguished line of rebels , it could hardly be expected that Virginia should be a dutiful child . And it was thus , like Eve before her , that looking at the tree of life , she saw it changing gradually into the tree of knowledge .  | PART TWO THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE I IT MAY be either pride or premature forgiveness that sticks a young person in his own past . With Amos and Ettie both , it had not been forgiveness . Pride will never admit that it has anything to forgive . In the book that contains the earliest of Virginia 's written memories , sometimes called the Word of God , the Lord is quoted as letting slip a mysterious expression : " one of us " ; very mysterious , since " us " is evidently not used as editors and royalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of us . " And who were the others ? Whoever they were , there were obviously more Gods than one in Eden , two at least . And the more you think about the probabilities , the more they fit in with that allusion . For the Lord God is said to have created man in his own image , and man is not a hermaphroditic animal ; he does not combine the male and female functions in himself , as he surely would have done if his Model had been truly One and Indivisible . No ; male and female created He them ; so that the other " one of us " was clearly of the feminine sex . What is more , research has revealed that neither was a later God , the God of Moses , the One and Only . Moses deceived the Israelites in telling them He was . In reality He was a hybrid . And his genealogy was as diverse and exfoliating as may be expected of any family tree . Thus there is nothing surprising in the fact that Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authority , was not one but two , her mother and her father , and that these two had not materialized out of emptiness , but out of a multitude of ancestors and circumstances tailing back into remotest time . Also it is reported that the Lord God looked upon his handi-  | work and called it good . He took a natural pride in his creation . Apparently He was so proud of it that He went a little further and called it perfect . For his only definition of sin thenceforward was any divergence from that status quo which He complacently imagined He had established . He visited terrible punishments upon his children because they insisted on departing from his notion of fixed perfection . They hurt his pride . Their actions plainly indicated that He did n't know everything and that the world as He had made it could be improved upon . The history of human progress is the history of human beings in rebellion against their successive Gods . But just before any notable change there comes a motionless hush like that before a storm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so uncertain within itself that it proclaims nothing but certainty and fixity and authority and the general perfection of the status quo . These people are the last of the Gods in their contemporaneous Eden , those whose pride is still involved in its manufacture , whose importance is its importance , whose significance is its significance , and whose death is its destruction . It is impossible for such people to have children and go on living , since the next generation is their overthrow . And whether they try to kill their children as their enemies or to cherish them as their own prolongation , they are disappointed both ways . Authentic parenthood is the dedication to dying in a better cause . It is to be consumed in hope . But the last Gods in any Eden see nothing better than themselves , but only worse , and have no hope . Their best is past . They remain the children of their parents . They can never be the parents of their children . The great and fundamental paradox is that to die for something better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to live ; and that to live for the self as an aspect of fixed Perfection is to die . Ettie and Amos Lacey were dying with their Eden and their status quo . Virginia had seen a photograph of her mother taken when Ettie was six years old , a bald-faced child with pale protruding eyes and fair hair skinned back from her brow . In a Scotch plaid polonaise , whose underskirt almost reached the tops of her high laced shoes , she stood on an artificial rock . One forearm was draped across a truncated pillar covered with a fringed velvet throw . Behind her , dimly , rose the classical ruins on the photographer 's backdrop . " If I live to be a hundred , " said Ettie , " I 'll never forget the day  | that that was taken . I could n't ' a ' been ' fraider of a gun . Oh , I was always so afraid of everything ! " And then she would tell about the time when her mother had been burning some old papers under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her direction , and she had run screaming into the house and hidden under the stand table ; and another time , at the Christmas entertainment at the church , when she would n't go up to the front like the other children to get her box of candy from Santa Claus , and when Santy had kindly come down the aisle to give it to her , she had hidden her head under her mother 's cape and whimpered in fright . That is , she had believed that the burnt black paper was floating straight at her , out of all creation , with some malevolent purpose . She had supposed that Santa Claus had singled her out from all the other children to do her harm . " Benjamin 's just like me , " she would say . " Do n't you remember his ice cream turkey ? " Virginia did indeed remember Benjamin 's turkey , small but lifelike , molded from chocolate ice cream . The day before Thanksgiving , their father had sent home six along with the milk . At lunch that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm ; and apparently of its own volition , the turkey had slithered slowly toward him . With a yell , Benjamin had thrown himself backward in his highchair , and chair and all , had toppled to the floor . In superiority and amusement , Virginia remembered his bellows of terror and pain . Always , for her , such incidents made a sort of prelude to her mother 's and her brother 's lives , like grotesque and sinister opening bars of music  --  although as yet she attached no special significance to them , and though she would have thought that if you represented Benjamin 's life by music , it should go on to sterner measures of self-control , whereas her mother 's life became ever more grotesque and sinister . When Ettie was six years old , her sister Sallie had been born ? an event heralded by such tears , such visitations from the Charleses , such loud explosions between her parents , that her own mother was seriously ill . Her grandfather Littleton planned to spend that summer in Kentucky and Virginia as usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and little granddaughter , he took the child along . Because Ettie 's great-uncle Marsh had been killed when his saddle girth slipped and he was dragged at the heels of his galloping horse , her great-uncle Aquila and his old maid daughter Delicia were the only Littletons who bore that name remaining in Kentucky . Cousin Lish was almost always away somewhere ,  | at that Louisville party , for instance , in honor of Big Ben Littleton , the prime minister manque . But to a little country girl from Sharon County , Maumee , Great-uncle Quill by himself was a sufficiently eye-opening relative . His legs were paralyzed , and he sat all day in his chair with a Paisley shawl folded over his knees . He had had a rolling table made which was just the right size to fit over his lap . And every afternoon Jeff , his Negro bodyservant , pushed this in , tinkling with glasses and ice and loaded with all the makings of toddies , juleps , and brandy smashes . Great-uncle Quill could drink like a lord and swear like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had a tall yellow housekeeper who , people said , had married Jeff for the looks of the thing  --  a piece of scandal which did not come to Ettie 's ears , of course , till she was older . But since that first visit with her grandfather was repeated every summer until she married , she divined at an early age the relationship between her great-uncle and his yellow housekeeper . Always she saw very clearly that Great-uncle Quill was a gentleman , and that this was how a gentleman lived : with all his sins of intemperance , blasphemy , and fornication upon his old head , without being ashamed of them and without being shunned by respectable people . On the contrary , he belonged to the best society and was a vestryman in the Episcopal church . The more consistent practices of the Maumee Baptists and Methodists began to seem naive and crude to Ettie . Besides Great-uncle Quill and Cousin Lish , there were numerous Kentucky cousins who were not named Littleton , being the descendants of Ettie 's grandfather 's sisters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen and to which she began to long to return . On the Maysville Pike , in a large brick house at the far end of an avenue of elms , lived Cousin John and Cousin Lizzie , his wife , and Cousin Laura , his daughter , and Great-aunt Ann , his mother who had been a Littleton , all waited on hand and foot by colored servants . It was at their house that Ettie and her grandfather most often stayed . Cousin John always said , " I kill a few extra hogs at butchering because I know the niggers will steal that many anyway . " Once , when there was a smallpox epidemic among the Negroes and field hands were scarce , Cousin John put on a big straw hat , a bandanna neckerchief , and long gauntlet gloves to shield him from the sun , and drove the reaper himself . At all other times he merely oversaw the overseer , Mr. Crouch , who was poor white trash . Cousin Lizzie ran the house and gave large parties for Cousin Laura 's young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ments , settled their quarrels , taught them their catechisms , and made their clothes . She bought bright cotton remnants at sales , from which she ran up shirts for the men and dresses for the women on her sewing machine , then gave them to one of the house servants to finish by hand . She sold these garments to the Negroes at a small profit which paid the doctor bills of those who were seriously sick . She was a busy woman . But Great-aunt Ann never turned her hand over . When she so much as wanted a drink of water , her black girl , Shug , had to fetch it for her . Shug slept on a pallet beside Aunt Ann 's bed where Aunt Ann could conveniently poke her with her cane when she wanted the chamber pot . Cousin Laura was a pretty popular girl about Ettie 's age . And there was also a Cousin Marg , Cousin John 's sister , who paid long visits at the house . Cousin Marg wore trailing ruffled wrappers of white dotted Swiss . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never married . One day Cousin John said , pretending to look askance at her big stomach , " W'y , Marg ! What 's this ? " And Cousin Marg said , shaking all over with laughter , " I swear to God , John , it must be a baby Jesus then ! " Those summers were a long succession of picnics and tennis parties and house parties and swimming parties in the Licking River , a beautiful name . They were the Indian Summer of the Old South . Ettie saw it just before the crickets fell dumb in the frosty pastures , and the laughter died , and the honey-colored moon went down , and the house party opened their eyes to a new morning and a change in weather . But when she was a visitor there , everybody thought that summer would last forever . After the Civil War , Kentucky , the right part of Kentucky , was like a sunny pocket in the corner of a wall where the flowers went on blooming in a private August for a time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden platform which stood in the yard . To make a smooth dancing surface , the platform was covered with the muslin cloths used at other times to protect the young tobacco plants . A scalloped canvas marquee was erected overhead , Japanese lanterns were strung around , and a Negro band was installed in one corner with a bottle of gin . Then the young men in their white suits and the girls in their pale organdy dresses danced till morning . " I remember that I had a pale blue organdy , that summer . Cousin Laura had a pink one something like it .... " In Virginia , where Ettie and her grandfather went on shorter visits , she saw him as an old man put on the Littleton hunt colors  | of green and yellow and ride to hounds one chilly morning . People who called him Cousin Roger looked after him with tears in their eyes . Ettie was taken to call at old houses of wine-colored brick , surrounded by neglected boxwood , houses whose floors were sab ging , whose battered paneling was hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends of her father 's family . The power and glory which had been theirs , which had been hers before her birth , filled her with a pride almost religious . The summer 's heyday there had long been over . But she was never able to forget a very small incident . It had happened during that first trip to Kentucky when she was only six years old . A colored man on the back porch at Cousin John 's was peeling a pineapple . She stood watching him , wondering what that queer vegetable could be , for she had never seen a pineapple before . She thought at once , " That 's something else too fine and grand for me to know about . I must n't let on we do n't have things like that to eat where I come from . " She saw the cook cut up the pineapple and mix it with white of egg . She helped the colored man to turn the freezer . At dinner she ate one helping of the sherbet and thought she had never tasted anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick that she could never eat pineapple or anything flavored with pineapple from that day forth . It seemed to her that that tropical fruit had slyly spoken to her : " Go away , little girl . You do n't belong here . You 're not good enough to eat me . I am the victuals of the gentry who know what is what . " After that , nothing good ever happened to Ettie in Sharon County , Maumee . Emotional conflict can immobilize a person 's faculties . And Ettie had a Kuntz-like emotionalism . Put a Kuntz in Ettie 's situation then , and queer things are bound to happen . When her father made her go barefooted in the summertime to save shoe leather , she cried for days and said the gravel hurt her feet . ( Cousin Laura wore shoes all summer long . ) When her mother made her pick a chicken , she picked it , but never ate chicken afterward . ( In Kentucky , the Negroes did such nasty jobs . ) Away from the South , nothing gratifying ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consent of the will , and since , along with her Kuntz-like cowardice , Ettie had an ominously strong will , you might say that only in the South anything happened to her at all . Elsewhere , events were all so painful that her one concern was to gloss them over , obviate , deny them . At the age of six , Ettie shut her eyes to her native surroundings  | and caused them to vanish . But her other actions announced that Sharon County existed just the same , in all those ways she could not bear to acknowledge ; and that actually her one concern was to escape the conditions she denied . There was nothing unworthy of her in her parents and her home ; certainly not . She would have bitten off her tongue before she would have made any such admission . It was only that they were a constant unendurable humiliation to her . When she was seven , she had to put on glasses . The Charleses paid for them . Scarcely any children , those days , wore glasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun of her and called her " Specs . " A year or so later the family doctor noticed that one of her shoulders stood higher than the other . He took her to a specialist in town , who found she had a spinal curvature . Once a week , for one whole winter , her father drove her in to Median where , in a torture chamber of the old Infirmary , the specialist hung her from the ceiling , with her toes barely touching the floor , until her spine was stretched . Then he bound her in a strait jacket and clamped her in a steel brace . Her father grumbled and scolded all the way to the Infirmary . You would have thought , to hear him talk , that the Charleses , who were paying for her treatments in the torture chamber , too , had deliberately invented some fancy ailments for her so as to flaunt their money before his poverty , and that she was in cahoots with them . Ettie came to hate her father in return . He would have let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have let her be a hunchback , rather than swallow his pride . She never wondered what it was in her that was her own most vigorous and sensitive part . She was a " good " child . She helped her mother without a murmur . By the time she was ten years old , she had made hundreds of beds and washed thousands of dishes , standing on a chair . She never sassed her parents . Silently , with quivering chin , she took her mother 's fretfulness and her father 's surliness and rages . She never got any sympathy from them ; oh , no . She liked to go and sit alone in the cold parlor where she talked to herself , and often wept , and pitied herself for her hard lot . But her grandfather Littleton was " Cousin Roger " throughout the Bluegrass and the Tidewater . On his coat tails she rode . In his name she was " Cousin Ettie . " He gave her reasons for holding up her head and looking down on other people ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Charleses were all right in their way . They lived in a fine house in Median . They had the money to  | buy her the glasses and the brace . They gave her those pretty clothes so that she could spend her summers in the South . Before she left , and after she came back , she began staying with the Charleses , and presently lived at home only during the school months . But the Charleses ' way was not the way of the Southern gentry , and often embarrassed Ettie . Their value to her was even an embarrassing value : to supply her with the things she ' should have had by rights . Even at that age , she spoke of them in tolerant apology . Her father made fun of the glasses and the brace . He said scathingly , " W'y , see how they spoil your looks ! " Ettie knew they spoiled her looks . She knew she was not pretty to begin with , not even after she had taken off the brace for good . The sexual outbursts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude and shocking . These children were little commoners and she was a little lady . They were stupid and she was much too bright . They were healthy and she wore glasses and a brace . And her lack of beauty , her ladylikeness , her high marks , and her infirmities were all defects to them , as , with the cruelty of children , they never let her forget . Ettie passionately believed that there must be something unusual about her to deserve such sufferings . She began to pride herself on all her exceptional qualities , and to feel superior to healthier happier people . She even began to pride herself on her physical plainness . She concluded that sex and a sexually attractive body were low and vulgar . In the South this rule did not hold good , she was aware . But there the comforting theory held that Northern girls were naturally plain and intellectual . When the Charleses sent her to " Friends ' , " she thought longingly of Miss Reba 's in Median , and rather despised the Quakers . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Southern relatives , standards to which she had not been born and to which she did not measure up , she thought she was the object of some stealthy missionary work . But to their faces she did all she could to make the Quakers like her . In general they did like her . She was not exactly popular . She was the Academy 's bright spoiled child . She graduated at the age of fifteen at the head of her class . This time she did n't wait for the Charleses to come forward with the money , but asked them if they would lend her enough to pay her way through college . At that age she undertook to borrow and pay back several thousand dollars . And the Charleses , impressed by her ambition and tickled by her seriousness , agreed to lend it to her , thinking the obligation would be good training for her character . Her father was infuriated by this arrangement . His ideas on the  | subject of education harked back to the Middle Ages when no gentleman could read or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was securely above the need of an education , lodged on the heights of patrician ancestry and inherited real estate . An education could be acquired , whereas it was the mark of a gentleman that he did n't need to acquire anything . And if this was the mark of a gentleman , it was much more the mark of a lady . Then , too , if Ettie had been a boy , he would have said the Charleses were making a " Miss Nancy " of her . As it was , the word " bluestocking " was not in his vocabulary ; and he could only fume and storm irrelevantly at the way the Charleses were destroying his daughter 's femininity by sending her to college . " This is a pretty kettle of fish ! This is a pretty howdy-do ! " was all he could say . Ettie 's trouble was that she thoroughly agreed with him . No female Littleton should go to college . No female Littleton should have to go to college . But since she had only two alternatives : to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Littleton , or to admit she was no true Littleton by acquiring better things for herself , she shut her eyes again to the realities , but acted on them just the same . She enrolled in a technical university in the next state . She said she had picked it out because she hated Latin and liked mathematics , a casual airy excuse for the grim work ahead of her , earning her own living to pay back her debt . She wanted to be a spoiled darling , a social butterfly , in the phrases of her day , with everything paid for her . Actually , she took a course in architecture , the only girl in any of her classes , and one of five girls in the whole university . Most girls would have thought that here was a remarkably fine chance to catch a husband . Ettie was so greatly afraid of being suspected of just such intentions that she leaned over backward to be brisk and cheerful with the young men , friendly but distinctly wholesome . She was still so young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the very notion of sex repelled her . And none of the young men fell in love with her , not one . Then , too , most girls in her place , in the 189o 's , when few girls went to college , let alone study architecture , would have been the kind who faced their futures as a hope , the exceptions of their day and age , " new women , " as they were beginning to be called . But Ettie tackled the higher calculus like a quarry slave at night , scourged to his dungeon . She graduated in architecture when she was nineteen years old , not quite at the head of her class , but with honors . At corn-  | mencement people stared at her and asked who she was as she sat on the platform , the only girl among nearly four hundred men . Afterward , strangers came up to be introduced to her : " I just want to shake the hand of this young lady ? " The newspaper of the college town made special mention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life Ettie was almost happy . Showered with attention , bathed in the glow of fame , she felt on her graduation day that she had achieved the first step toward some supernal destiny . It was supernal indeed . In full magnificence its American phase had taken place about a hundred years before . It had come to an end in Great-uncle Quill , who could drink like a lord and swear like a sailor , who kept his yellow housekeeper as his mistress , who had been a member of the best society and a vestryman in the Episcopal church , the last of Christian gentlemen . Ettie 's escape from Sharon County , even through architecture , was an escape backward into an unreality whose reality she was bound to affirm , since its importance was the only importance she recognized in herself , and its life the only life she valued , and its death a death whose admission would be her suicide . To be a lady , with every ladylike appurtenance , was what she wanted at a time when all real ladies and gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's youth , and he had plenty of objectives for his affection . There were usually several carloads of them on the place . Though little boys were " breeched " later in those days than they are now , it is a fact that he was still in dresses when he used to slip out of the house , get an ear of corn , climb the fence of the pasture where the half-broken colts were kept , and offer a colt the ear of corn . When the colt put down its head , Amos would clutch its mane and slide down its neck as it threw up its head again . Hearing the thunder of galloping hoofs , his mother would look out of the window and there sure enough would see him , not much bigger than a monkey , galloping bareback around the pasture , with all the other colts tearing along behind . He grew up to be the son who , with the help of the hired men , broke the horses and trained them . He was a skinny wiry boy , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for whom he was named , had small eyes set far back in the dark caverns of their sockets . And his stern habitual scowl plainly denied that his eyes , too , turned inward toward his nose . ) Since Amos did not put on glasses till he went to college , it may have been partly an emotional result of a physical defect that in most things he was uncertain of himself , and looked to his father 's direction . But that  | kindred defect , traceable to Sarah Jane , less localized and much more serious , had the same submissive result and that same quality of doom peculiar to anything mysterious for which an individual himself is not responsible . He knew what had to be done without being told only when it came to horses . He could ride anything . He could drive anything . When he was old enough to have a horse of his own , it was a dangerous handsome brute ; and any girl who went buggy riding with Amos Lacey came back convinced that she had narrowly escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once a horse threw him on to the open blades of a reaping machine , and he bore the long puckered scars down his back the rest of his life . But he , who was so hesitant in other things , and always afraid of human beings , knew just how to stun a vicious horse by knocking it in the head with a club , and often did so without fear , temper , or compunction . He was sent as a matter of course to Gurney College where his aunt Miriam Lacey had been the head of the Latin department until her death , where his uncle Eli Lacey was then president , and his father was a trustee . Like most Quaker schools and colleges , Gurney was co-educational . Its students were the children of farmers and small-town merchants . And among these Amos took a place of some eminence , not through his own exertions , but because he was his aunt Miriam 's and his uncle Eli 's nephew and his father 's son . His roommate , Jim Steddom , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophomore year , the judge died and left very little money ; so that Amos persuaded his father to lend Jim the money for finishing college ; and it came about that even in this friendship , which for that matter was close and sincere on both sides , Amos had the upper hand because he was Robert Lacey 's son . He was careful not to make capital of his relatives ' importance , almost too careful . His violent dislike of any form of bragging had something suspect in it . And his attitude of exaggerated modesty in regard to his connection with the former Latin professor , the president , and a trustee of a jerkwater college like Gurney would have been comical if it had seemed so to anybody there . He despised the sort of mind that memorizes information without understanding it . He strove earnestly to understand his books and lectures . And because , in spite of his strivings , he never got high marks , he was inclined to confuse academic brilliance with an inferior facility , and to emphasize the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested him most were  | economics and biology . The doctrine of enlightened self-interest was popular then ; so was the evolutionary theory . In his bachelor 's thesis Amos combined the two in a defense of capitalism . He and Jim Steddom used to argue loud and long over the rights and wrongs of capitalism . Jim was going to be a lawyer , and argued better than Amos did , but could never succeed in convincing him that John D. Rockefeller was a blood-sucking social parasite . " W'y ! " Amos would say with intense vehemence . " These days a man drives up to your door with your five gallon of coal oil , and charges you less than you used to pay when you had to go to the store and get it yourself . As my father says , as long as old John D. has done that for the consumer , I 've got no quarrel with him . " At that time profits and the Republican party were the same thing . So what good Quaker could be a Democrat ? Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former slave owner . When Amos remembered why the Laceys had left their comfortable homes in South Carolina , when he remembered that the Craydocks had been underground railroaders in Ohio , and when he remembered the adventures of his uncle Eli in the strongholds of the Democrats , such catchwords as " log-rolling " and " pork barrel " could not sever him from the party of Abraham Lincoln . Lincoln and Rockefeller were ill-matched trotting mates , said Jim . But Amos was so far from thinking so that nothing roused his vehemence as much as this assertion . Everybody at Gurney had heard about Uncle Eli 's humane endeavors in the depths of Georgia , when he had been tarred and feathered and ridden on a rail , and honored him because of them . Amos 's uncle Dick was becoming a leading businessman of Median . And his father , as a humane businessman , was more highly respected than anybody else in his community . From them Amos himself derived prestige ; and so as not to mar his own reflected importance , he mixed **34;613;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers : Eli , Robert , and Dick , with Robert , Amos 's father , filling the strained position of the means between the extremes with outstanding success . And Amos 's father more nearly approximated God in his eyes than any abstraction . Therefore Amos was so far from seeing any incompatibility in the team of Lincoln and Rockefeller that the whole gist of his arguments consisted in pointing out how perfectly matched it was . Amos 's pride , like Ettie 's , was clannish and exterior to himself . A dreadful suspicion of their personal inner insignificance was the whole motivation of both their lives . But this was the very  | thing Ettie spent her time in trying to hide , whereas Amos had an openly low idea of himself , so open and exaggerated that it was almost like a pose . And yet he had a dogged originality , too . His mental processes were scarcely mental at all . His opinions were more like emotions , very deep-seated . But in so far as he thought at all , he thought for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim that there might be something in him . And who can say what uncomfortable intimations needled Amos into defending capitalism in his bachelor 's thesis ? Why did it need defending ? What provoked the vehemence of his arguments with Jim ? " Something in him " he felt he might believe , but would never have the strength to uphold ? For Amos had also an appealing helplessness . He was manifestly unable to look after himself . He defended himself as a Quaker , a Republican , and a capitalist , but would not defend himself as an individual . He shrank from standing up for his own rights and from putting himself forward out of a delicacy so acute as to be a deliberate invitation to failure . He was a very loyal young man . Jim was not alone in detecting that originality which inspired the hope that Amos might have something in him , and in pitying his helplessness and sensitiveness . There was a girl in Amos 's class named Minnie Wright , who was gayer and more knowingly dressed than most Quaker girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides . She saw that Amos stood in need of practicality . She fell in love with him because she thought she could bring him out and make a distinguished man of him . She told him he was cut out to be some sort of scientist . In their junior year she and Amos were not exactly engaged . A Quaker girl and boy were seldom ever engaged , but had an " understanding . " This was supposed to be better than an engagement because it was not official or coercive , but private and experimental , leaving a couple free to reconsider up to the last minute before their marriage  --  an arrangement which fostered personal responsibility and protected sincerity , but which worked out to Minnie 's disadvantage . After Amos met Ettie Littleton , his understanding with Minnie continued for two or three years . But Minnie was aware that she never seemed quite so sympathetic or attractive to him again . And thanks to their " understanding , " she had no strings on him . Ettie began repaying the Charleses for her college education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the northern part of the state . With her degree she could have got a better salary as a high school teacher . And since she was a graduate architect ,  | it was strange that she took up school teaching at all . As a matter of fact , she cherished a vague dream of entering a firm of architects in a consulting capacity at some future time . But once in a while she also recalled that the Median lawyer , " James Gaynor Brooks , " used to say when she had been a loquacious child , " We 'll have to make a lawyer out of this young lady " ; and she seriously wondered if she should not have taken up the law instead of architecture . She had repeatedly told herself that she was studying architecture so as to pay back her aunts and uncles . But now that the time for doing so had come , she was teaching in an ordinary grade school . Was n't that what all downtrodden refined young women did when they needed money ? She hated school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job  --  one reason , maybe , she had taken it . For when she had to act without the protection of authority , she characteristically avoided any real test of what she considered her real abilities . She hated to risk her superiority . But her pupils suffered under her superhuman ideas of discipline and the irritability of her temper . Always she condoled with herself because the Charleses had not made her a present of her college education as they had made her a present of her high school education . She looked upon herself as ill-treated . And to show how ill-treated she was , she was earning money in the most pathetic , disagreeable way she could think of . Besides , it is doubtful if she had ever taken any real interest in architecture . What she took an interest in was Ettie Littleton , whoever that might be . And all through school and college she had done brilliantly in that subject ( though she was so young , and only a girl , and her parents were poor , and she had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrageous fortune ) . At her boarding house she shared a room with another teacher , Christine Wade , whom she had known at Friends ' Academy . Christine had an understanding with Joseph John Lacey , Amos 's younger brother . He was a junior at Gurney when Amos was a senior . The little town where Christine and Ettie taught was not far from Gurney . And one week end , when Christine was going there to visit Joseph John , she invited Ettie to come along . As a beau for Christine 's friend , J. J. , as they called him , provided his brother Amos . Ettie was no prettier by this time than she had ever been . She was tall for a girl and raw-boned and thinner than was fashionable . But she had acquired that distinction of appearance and that extreme cleanliness and neatness which girls with pale red hair  | and thin white skins sometimes have . Her air of breeding showed up mere prettiness as rather vulgar . She wore smart clothes , and she wore them with a dash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verve , a small-town Boldini , for she wore her pince-nez on a gold chain hooked over one ear , and her clothes originated far from Paris . Nevertheless the general effect was surprisingly right . Amos Lacey , whose standpoint was not Parisian , was instantly smitten when he and J. J. met the girls at the train . Ettie looked like fireworks , yet ladylike fireworks , even cool , a phosphorescent paradox which reassured Amos 's natural disinclination to play with fire . He might have been warned by the eyes behind the pince-nez . They were a strange light blue , cold and glassy , yet anxious looking . The skin visible through the broad sparse sandy eyebrows had a way of flushing up emotionally when there was no perceptible reason for so much emotion . But Amos was not warned . Instead he saw that she was all in black , a small feminine version of a black Homburg hat tilted down over her nose , a black broadcloth jacket with leg o ' mutton sleeves , a sweeping black broadcloth skirt , and black kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw her fair complexion into shining contrast . Minnie , the darling of his heart , at once seemed too befrizzed and be-frilled . And when , next day , Ettie appeared in a plaid golf cape and a fuzzy green tam o ' shanter  --  not that there was a golf course this side of Chicago  --  his fascination was complete . He was not scared or antagonized to learn that she had graduated in architecture the year before , and yet was two years younger than he , while he was only a senior at Gurney . Neither , in this achievement , did he smell anything less honorable than exceptional ability , though here again his personal judgment was not concerned . Quakers had always approved of enterprise and intellectual prowess in women . Therefore these qualities were admirable in Ettie . And therefore the edginess she usually noticed in young men was absent between her and Amos from the first . Several times that spring she went back to Gurney . She scorned the yokels there as doubly green because of their rural background and sectarian morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rural background and her unsuccessful exposure at Friends ' to just such sectarian morality . But she had tact enough to trade on the latter experience . And the rare sense of her superiority to everybody there caused her amiability to be unforced for once . For the first time in her life , away from home , she was relieved of the  | uneasiness of wondering if she were doing the right thing , if she were behaving so that she need not blush for herself . During those l week ends she was the most likable she had ever been . Amos , who had a terror of his own species and a Swiftian preference for horses , greatly admired her social ease , her vivacious chatter , her smiles , her smirks , her gracious condescension . He himself was not a bad-looking young man now that his dark squinting eyes were partly hidden by glasses . He had a strong frame and broad shoulders , though he was only of medium height .. He had a small Irish face of great sensitiveness , with beautifully cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All his features were as mobile as a blind man 's , and this mobility gave him a look of nakedness . You felt sorry for him , your heart went out to him , and yet you loathed him , too , for looking so shamefully unprotected . You felt an impulse to hurt him because hurting him would be so easy . His Quaker training not to be governed by emotion took the form in him of trying not to show his feelings , In this he was verbally successful . But even when he never said a word , you had only to look at his face to see , stated with cruel plainness , all he felt and thought . That face of his was like a bared bottom forever turned up to be kicked . As an individual he could have attracted only a maternal sort of girl , a girl who loved him more the more he wrung her heart . And since Ettie was anything but maternal , the chief emotion he aroused in her was a slight revulsion . However , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual than as his father 's son ; and beyond Ettie 's reaction to him as a separate person , too , was her respect for his father 's position in her native neighborhood . He was also the nephew of a college president , Eli Lacey , and the nephew of Dick Lacey ; and everybody around Stillwater and Pigeon Ford had heard how stylish and citified Dick Lacey was becoming in Median , and how well he was doing in the milk business there . Then Amos was Ettie 's first serious beau . True , even after she began to suspect him of matrimonial intentions , she took it for granted that she was headed for higher things than marrying Amos Lacey . But she simply could n't bear to let him slip through her fingers . That summer , when he was home from college and she was home from teaching , he came to supper at her house . After supper they drove out behind one of his alarming horses . The first two or three times Ettie was about to leave for Kentucky , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Not wishing him to suppose that her own rather draggle-tailed environment was  | the best she knew , she heavily freighted her conversation with Cousin Joe 's racing stable near Lexington and Cousin Laura 's wedding at which she was to be , and then had been , a bridesmaid . Neither did she neglect the subsidiary topic of the Charleses and their bank and their big house in Median . She gave Amos to understand that the Charleses had practically brought her up . With all she told him , his approval grew . He revered financial success . He revered what he called " good blood , " and was not put off by the Southern traditions of the Littletons . Southern ideas seemed less Satanical in a girl . For there was at this time an outcropping of popular novels in which the Yankee hero invariably married the Southern heroine . In fact , Amos significantly presented Ettie with one of these . The Southern myth was just then taking possession of the Northern imagination ; and the Christian Businessman was falling in love with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when copper kings and pork packers and mill owners and railroad presidents were marrying their sons to impoverished Southern girls of aristocratic extraction , and their daughters to European dukes and counts , and were setting up suits of armor in their front halls , and buying family crests and family trees . The tradition of feudalism , of the Christian Gentleman , was so firmly embedded still that rich men could not persuade themselves that they had any right to their money unless they could make it appear that they had inherited that right . They were of Frank Littleton 's opinion : the mark of a gentleman was that he did not need to acquire anything , so that their new and obvious acquisitions filled the copper kings and pork packers and mill owners and railroad presidents with shame . They hastened to give the impression that they had really had them all the time . Amos Lacey , of course , cared nothing for " such foolishness . " He would have told you that his idea of " good blood " was unbroken generations of British ancestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against odds , such as his own family had to show . He would have told you that he was a Quaker , an original democrat , humanitarian , pacifist , and feminist , and as such , as directly opposed to the contrary ideals of any feudal aristocracy as it was possible to be .. But , alas , he would have told you , too , that he was a dyed-in-the-wool Republican , and that John D. Rockefeller was carrying on the good work Abraham Lincoln had started , and that he worshiped his father . He would not have told you that , through a sort of leakage from his times , he had acquired the suspicion that money was no very good reason for itself ,  | for he would not admit this to himself And yet the very stubbornness of his self-deception attested the importance of this suspicion . Where understanding stops , categorical imperatives are necesand very handily supply the reasons for what you wanted to do in the first place . Ettie 's notion of " good blood " ? her father 's notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which nothing could be taken away  --  was just such a compelling inscrutable reason for Amos 's respect for riches . It enabled him to sympathize with Ettie 's attitude : Poverty had forced her into effort , and she resented the poverty , and wished she could have done without the necessity to improve herself . She detested the implication that there was any room in her for improvement . She longed to be like her Southern cousins who , having accomplished the stupendous feat of their birth , rested on their laurels . " I will supply the money , " thought Amos . He was like the body of his time and place looking for a soul , a reason for existence . Ettie was like the soul , the spirit of the dead , looking for a body , a means of existence . Ill-assorted though they were , they were looking for each other . Amos 's experience in stock breeding had helped him to understand Darwin at college . He had probably never heard the word " eugenics . " But the theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had put into the heads of Eugenic Society members : To improve the human race , you had only to mate the best individuals . And though his thoughts on the subject were muddled as usual , his purpose was straightforward . For it was actually no improvement he had in mind , but a clinching of what he valued in his past and of something else he had sneakingly begun to admire in Ettie 's remoter past . It was this in him that hankered after paternity : the deep wish to halt change and time , the wish for dead children , not living children at all . Neither did it occur to him that it was not living individuals he planned to mate , but categorical units , two people dubbed " the best " by two different external standards : money and gentility . And yet he distrusted his affection for Minnie Wright because it was personal . He approved of Ettie more because he liked her less . He loved to scare the daylights out of a girl by taking her out driving behind Sal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse that reared . But Ettie , although she was terrified , did not enjoy her terror , and did n't scream worth a cent when she went driving with Amos . Neither did she utter cries of admiration over his cool subof Sal or Maude . She held on to the buggy rail , and was simply as mad as a wet hen . How either of them spared a thought  | from the horse is a mystery . But it is a fact that Ettie ceaselessly bragged about her family and that Amos untiringly listened , plotting Darwinian plots upon her that were erotically exciting and scientifically excusable . The moonlight shone silver all around , and the buggy rattled over the stones . On the last Sunday before Ettie went back to teaching , she noticed Amos 's ceremonial air of parting . Implying a relationship between them she had not consented to , it gratified her , scared her , and annoyed her . It instilled an important meaning into something Amos said , carefully and deliberately , during their buggy ride after supper . When his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amos 's father had supplied the capital , half of which Uncle Dick was to pay back . In exchange for the other half , Amos 's father had taken a one-third share in the business . By this time the first half was paid back , and the dividends on the stock of the one-third interest had increased the whole original investment by about twenty-five per cent , Uncle Dick was doing so well . Amos 's father considered this an ample return for his money , and had said to Amos that if he wanted to go into the milk business with his uncle , he might have the one-third interest in the company as a present . Amos said , " My great-grandfather Lacey gave his oldest son five hundred dollars to start him out in life . Grandfather Lacey gave Father a three-hundred-acre farm . And now Father is going to give me this stock if I want it . " He paused and added modestly , " It amounts to about twenty thousand dollars . " Ettie listened attentively , realizing that such financial details were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a proposal . With a jar , as if folding doors had been clapped open on a feast , she saw herself living in the city , married to a man who owned one third of his uncle 's business . She had never outgrown the Littleton contempt for " barter . " Just the same , as with the Charleses , it could fulfill the useful function of supplying her with all those things to which her birth entitled her . " But I do n't know ! " said Amos , screwing up his features into an anxious squint . " Sometimes I 've a good notion to go down to the Argentine and buy me a cattle ranch . " " A cattle ranch ! " cried Ettie , her vision gone glimmering . Amos glanced at her out of his worse eye , with his deprecating smile . " If Father did n't give me that stock , he 'd give me the money for the ranch , " he said . " Good land is going cheap down there . "  | " Well ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bathing in a wash tub by the kitchen stove . " You could n't hire me to live any place where I could n't have running water and a hot bath every day . " Amos glanced at her again and his smile became even more deprecating . Her reply had been a kind of double talk . He understood that the coast was clear to marry her if he entered his uncle 's business . He admired Ettie 's great refinement . She had to have a hot bath every day . Then and there he made up his mind to be a businessman . His uncle Dick was a good businessman . More important , his father was a good businessman . Therefore he ought to be a good businessman . But it was his family fidelity which told him so , as usual , and not a knowledge of his own abilities . He was temperamentally inclined to solitary patient work of some sort , what sort he had never found out . But business ! Granted that the pattern of life itself imposed the rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided up all the money in the world , and started every man out equal , there would soon be rich and poor again " ? and had n't he maintained it a thousand times ? ? still that was not to say that he himself enjoyed the prospect of competing with the strange unfriendly personalities of other men . He would , however , have felt entirely sure of himself over thousands of cattle . He would have needed a lot of horses on his ranch . He would have been in the saddle every day , he imagined  --  delightful thought . He would have been his own boss . Ile would have succeeded as a rancher in the Argentine . He felt ashamed of himself , his regret was suddenly so violent , as he sat there beside Ettie , and firmed up his mouth , and decided to go into the milk business in Median . Then , remembering the tacit promise in her words , he stuck the whip into its socket , put one arm around her , and smiled fondly into her face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were small and crooked and brownish . Their smile gave him a rat-like look . She at once regretted what she had said , and slid as far away from him as she could . " Now looky here ! " she said sharply . " I never have put up with that sort of thing , and I do n't propose to begin now ! " But Amos even approved of her stand-offishness . " Spunky , too are you ? " he said , and beamed upon her . Minnie Wright did the brave decisive thing a year later , when Amos had n't so much as written in all that time . She married a  | young history teacher in a country high school , an act which wholly committed Amos to his courtship of Ettie . He was having his troubles . Just as he had expected , his uncle Dick 's kindness and his own hard work did nothing to promote a friendly feeling between him and the other men in the office . Though Amos feared them and disliked them , as he feared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him , and put their covert hostility down to jealousy . To prove that his presence there was not entirely due to family favoritism , to show he earned his way , he worked harder than ever . He nearly killed himself with work . Then city life and city ways were strange . He did n't like them either ; and his uncle Dick and his uncle Dick 's family , at whose house he boarded , were becoming extremely urban . They had a maid , they kept a carriage , there were finger bowls on the table when company came . These stylish customs embarrassed Amos , and made him feel like an imposter . But they also made him wish more than ever that Ettie would marry him and be his guide . Seeing that he had to live in the city , he trusted that as his wife she would put up the right front for him while he supplied the money . Her savoir faire and social ease had impressed him from the beginning . Her more worldly experience was what he wanted now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Littletons . Worldly experience and gentility were not Quakerish possessions . But " something in " Amos may sometimes have confided that neither was a lot of money very Quakerish , not if you came right down to it . And he was finding out that one thing leads to another . Besides , if there was guilt in worldly experience and gentility , that guilt was Ettie 's . In marrying her , Amos could continue to repudiate the guilt but annex the advantages . Under a similar delusion his father had married his mother . And so , as he began to depend on his uncle Dick 's direction at the creamery , he began to look forward to Ettie 's direction in domestic life . Seven whole years he and Ettie had an understanding . She was no Quaker , and she made the most of such a loose arrangement . She would n't say yes and she would n't say no . She still went South with her grandfather in the summers , but found Kentucky changed for the worse now that her cousin Laura was married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that she ought to be married , too , in order to match experiences with Cousin Laura . And when she was twenty-five , she remembered that at twentyfive a girl became an old maid . She had finally paid back the Charleses , and had begun to save her teaching money with the  | half-acknowledged purpose of buying her trousseau . And yet she abhorred the idea of marrying anybody , Amos Lacey in particular . She was still looking for  --  what ? What bright glorious crown had been promised to her as a child ? She knew that she was on the verge of marrying Amos , although she was not in love with him . Wondering how this had happened , wondering really what it was to be in love , and hating to think that she had missed this widely publicized experience , she came to believe that she must have been in love with Dr. Rice , that handsome neighbor of the Charleses ' who had laughed at her that Saturday morning when the calf had bawled in the back of the spring wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had made a pet of her when she was in her teens . He had taken her to the theater maybe three or four times , and had brought her a box of chocolates once . Then , in demonstrating an operation on a syphilitic patient before a group of students at the Infirmary , he had accidentally cut his rubber glove and scratched his finger . After enduring such horrors as Ettie could only imagine , he had died . And now , as she recalled that his death had put an end to some plans she had occasionally dallied with , she told herself that Dr. Rice had been her one and only love . She could not marry another . Her heart was in the grave . She hinted as much to Amos who listened respectfully , but continued to hope . Then she began to persuade herself that , although the man she loved was dead , and she was faithful to his memory , she might marry Amos in a sober spirit and make him a good wife . However , no sooner had she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a convincing story which would allow her to marry Amos without loving him than she began to play with the idea of going to India as a missionary . The landlady at her boarding house was a retired missionary and still an active member of the Methodist foreign missions board . She saw in Ettie an intelligent energetic worker for the Lord ; and Ettie had religious leanings : The thought of teaching docile little Hindus in a mission school amidst picturesque surroundings had a strong pull for her . Her present pupils were far from docile , and her surroundings were on the sordid side . Unless she went to India she saw nothing ahead of her but continuing to teach till she was retired in her old age  --  nothing else , that is , but marrying Amos : a choice of evils . Certainly she was not a Methodist , but she could become one . And a drastic move like going to India would take her far away from her bleak dilemma . As the expression is , Ettie had not " found herself . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Packer ? A Kuntz ? A Lamotte ? A country girl from Sharon County , Maumee ? A Quaker student at Friends ' ? A graduate architect ? A schoolteacher ? A missionary ? Mrs. Amos Craydock Lacey ? That was exactly what she wanted to know , and could not find out . She took great care to announce that she was a bona fide Littleton . Yet all the time she was mortally afraid to look inside herself and find out what she was , lest that loud insistent announcement should not be true . And all roles but the role that it announced were equally hateful to her . One evening she came down from her room and abruptly said that she had decided to go to India . " You got the call ! " said the landlady . " I knew you would ! Were you praying like I told you ? " " No , " said Ettie angrily , " I just decided by myself . " She had no taste for a pious vocabulary outside of church . She scorned her landlady because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ettie 's estimation , and she dreaded to become one . Also she dreaded to become a missionary because missionaries were nobodies , socially , and never had much money . The landlady was disappointed in her reply , but resolute . " Well , praise the Lord anyhow , " she said . " I think we ought to pray . " She flopped forward from her chair into a kneeling position , folded her hands under her chin , and began in a singsong , " I thank thee , dear Jesus , that thou hast brought this wandering sheep into thy fold . " Ettie felt obliged to kneel down too . As she knelt there , she began to cry . And the landlady took her tears as a sure sign of her vocation . The following week end , Ettie went to visit the Charleses , and Amos came to call on her there . He sat down beside her on the parlor sofa , and took her hand , and tried to see into her face . When Ettie turned her face away , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back again  --  being playful . And when Amos was playful , he caused in Ettie violent retchings of the spirit . " What about it ? " he asked smilingly . " You 're not gon na keep me on tenterhooks much longer . Are you ? " Ettie sat there for a long minute , with her eyelids lowered . Then , for the second time that week , she burst into tears . Amos hugged and . kissed her gently . " Name the day , " he whispered in her ear . Ettie opened her eyes . " Oh , what is this ? February ? " she asked  | impatiently , half strangled with her sobs . " We might as well make it May , I guess ! I always wanted to be married in May when the apple blossoms were out . " And so , one chill rainy afternoon , she and Amos were married in the parlor of her parents ' house . Large vases of wet apple blossoms stood about on tabourets and tables . She felt more as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a likeness at that . Her despair that afternoon came from her fear that , as a Littleton , she was about to die . Her defiance came from her determination to go on being a Littleton in spite of Amos and the children he wanted and the Quakers and all the hostile circumstances ranged against her . She went into marriage as into battle , with the grit of loneliness and terror . She fought so cruelly well that the male and female elements in Virginia 's Parent , Creator , and Moral Authority were never equally divided . Ettie was a good three-fourths of all the God Virginia knew . Still there was something of her father in Him . And owing to that wedding in the Littleton parlor , Virginia had been born to all good gifts , everything locally and contemporaneously considered desirable : gentility , money , and Christian piety  --  no great amount of any of these , since they tended to neutralize one another , but just enough of all to enable her to value them . And yet she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular avatar had reared his terrible entrancing head . And like the little French girl in the Bois , who , observing the little French boy , exclaimed in admire tion , " Ah ! Ce que c'est commode ! " Virginia had discovered an irreparable difference between herself and Benjamin , a difference to her disadvantage . For try as she would , and as she sometime . did , she could not manage dull necessity in any such convenieu i entertaining fashion . In fact , there was nothing very interestin about her own anatomy . She had a body like a doll 's . But Ben jamin had a supernumerary feature never added to dolls , whether boy dolls or girl dolls .  | Up in the playroom which adjoined her mother 's bedroom , and was always too close to observation and interference , Virginia had once undressed Benjamin in the presence of Harry Clancey , the retired politician 's son from across the street . Harry sent her postcards at Easter and Christmas , and was rather sweet on her . She was just pointing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses , his panty waist , and stockings , and was saying to Harry , " Now there 's his liver ? " when her mother walked in . Ettie took in this scene with a pale severity of countenance entirely new to Virginia . Harry went home , and Benjamin tried hastily to get into his Russian suit again , propelled by some soundless overwhelming force . Neither Virginia nor Benjamin was punished , and nothing was said about the incident afterward . It was so awful , the children gathered , that the only thing to do was to pretend it had not happened . There was not much likelihood that Benjamin , under any circumstances , would have led a life of delinquency . Benjamin was like a little roundtower , keeping himself to himself . But Virginia was more of a prodigal , less circumscribed , less self-sufficient , in spite of her unmoved exterior , and she had a decided taste for the illicit . She might have got into worse scrapes if she had not been led to deduce that all conversation about sex and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Virginia was helplessly a snob . The deficiencies of all other children were continually pointed out to her by her mother with Pharisitical implications . And Virginia had only to connect matters of sex with children so irredeemably common that she could n't even play with them to restrain her own impulses in that direction . She tentatively accepted her mother 's attitude : To be born might have some dim disgraceful association with sex ; but to be well-born was parthenogenesis . Yet this afflicted her with discontent and restlessness , as when her mother would not take her to the Gaiety Theater to see Sis Hopkins , or put her finger to her lips when Virginia asked , " What is a BAR ? " One afternoon a girl named Corinne Katz had heaved herself over the alley fence and balanced there astride , staring at Virginia and Benjamin who were half-heartedly playing fire engine in the glider swing . They were feeling bored . The swing , two slat seats which faced each other and slid back and forth as you pressed the connecting footrest , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand pile . " You 're getting too old for a sand pile anyway , " their mother had said . But the real reason for keeping them out of the sand pile was that all the cats in the neighbor-  | hood had begun to use it as a toilet . It was " downright unsanitary , " a pronouncement which usually heralded some deprivation or other . The children could n't make the swing go high or far . It just slid jerkily back and forth , too obviously not a fire engine , more like a couple of rocking chairs . Corinne Katz 's father had a tailoring and pressing shop , a dark den , next to the drugstore on University Avenue where the streetcars ran . The Katzes lived over the shop . Such surroundings barred Corinne from the children who lived on Parkway where the streetcars did not run , whose families lived in houses with lawns front and back , and whose fathers maintained their places of business at a decent distance . Corinne herself was in no way a prepossessing harbinger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which contrasted oddly with her rough dark red hair . Her short pigtails , tied with shoestrings , always looked as if they had been braided the week before . She had a wide mouth with broad pale lips turned back on her face like a codfish 's mouth , She had an unchildlike nose and mean little near-set greenish eyes . Her dresses were faded and her black stockings ( not white , as they should have been ) hung in coils around her shoe tops , and always had holes in the knees . The children from Parkway , coming out of the drugstore with all-day suckers and sacks of penny candy , catching sight of Corinne near the tailoring and pressing shop , would yell , " Sheeny , sheeny , sheeny ! " at her to make her run . Or else they would chant vigorously in chorus : " Red , white , and blue ! Your father 's a Jew ! Your mother 's a broomstick , And so are you ! " Hearing this , Corinne 's father , a gnomish man , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go avay ! " he would shout . " Vot you do ? Iss a free country ? No ? " whereupon the children would break into loud jeering laughter and run off . If Virginia and Benjamin had had the support of numbers , they might have begun to yell , " Sheeny , sheeny , sheeny ! " when Corinne appeared over the alley fence . And if other children had been playing with them , they would not have been bored . But as it was , as Corinne balanced there astride , staring at them , they simply stared back . Virginia was standing on the footrest of the swing , braced between two opposite arms , pushing them back and  | forth , and Benjamin on the other side was doing the same . As Corinne slid down on top of the trash bin , jumped off , and came up the walk between the privy and the garage , they fell back from their spread-eagled positions and sat down on the swing seat , side by side . Corinne boldly approached . She sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronouncedly chummy . " Hello ! " she said . " Hello , " said Virginia . " Watcha doing ? " asked Corinne . " Playing fire engine , " said Benjamin . " We were , " he added accurately . He meant no rudeness . " Oh , yeah , " said Corinne , looking at him with attention . Then she asked in a grown-up conversational manner , " Do you go to the moving pitchers much ? " The children did not . They barely knew there were such things . But Virginia answered in an off-hand way , " Not very much , " causing Benjamin to turn and stare at her . " Do you ? " she asked . " Oh , yes , indeedy , " said Corinne . " I was there last night . I bet you was n't there . " Virginia and Benjamin were silent , gnawed by envy . " My mamma and papa took me , " said Corinne . " I bet you do n't know what they do in the moving pitchers . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , too , know ! " said Virginia . " Well , what do they do ? " asked Corinne . " Oh ? W'y , they move ! " said Virginia . " No-o-o ! " said Corinne , scornful of this dodge . " I mean , what do they do ? " " Oh ! Lots of things , " said Virginia . " Well , I bet you do n't know what they done last night . " Corinne lowered her voice . " What he done to her ! " " Who did to who ? " said Benjamin , always accurate . Virginia was not entirely wrong when she called Benjamin " Professor Lacey , " nor Amos when he said that college professors ran in the blood . There was often more than a trace of Uncle Eli in Benjamin 's manner . " W'y , this good-looking fella in the moving pitchers , " said Corinne . " What he done to the girl ! " " What ? " asked Benjamin . " Oh ! " said Corinne . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at her , fascinated . " Do n't you know what it was he done ? " asked Corinne . " W'y , what a fella does to a girl . You know what that is , do n't you ? "  | Virginia and Benjamin still stared . " W'y ! " said Corinne , leaning forward . " He . " The children had never heard that word before . But they had a hazy portentous notion of its meaning . They sat there , outwardly paralyzed , inwardly and pleasurably troubled . " W'y ! That 's nothing ! " said Corinne . " Didja ever go to Riverdale Park ? If you just go over by the river and kinda sing to yourself or throw stones or sumpn , and look behind the bushes over there , you can see all you want . Us kids does it lots of times . W'y , I seen a fella ? " Leaning farther forward , gazing into the children 's faces with a terrible eagerness , she imparted whispered details . " The cops do n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaring the children even more . So this was a jailing offense ! " The cops does it , too , out at Riverdale Park . Every chance they get , you betcha ! " Virginia and Benjamin sat there so strangely silent that Corinne looked at them uneasily . " Well , I got ta be going , " she said . " You do n't know much . Do you ? " Half-way across the yard she turned and looked back at them , sitting side by side . " Does your mother know you 're out ? " she yelled , and then broke into a run . At the alley fence she did not unhook the back gate , but scrambled up on the trash bin , scaled the fence , and disappeared the way she had come , as if the dogs were after her . This thought occurred to Virginia , and she looked at Benjamin with a grin . " Oh , deary me , ' said Silver Paws , They 're after me , I know ! ' " she quoted from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wild and wondering spectacled gaze upon her . And they both sat there quite a while , not looking at each other . Then they rose and went dazedly into the house where each took a book and read till dinnertime . Neither of them ever mentioned Corinne Katz to the other . They never saw her again except when she was running down University Avenue , looking back over her shoulder , as the Allisons yelled after her , " Sheeny , sheeny , sheeny ! " All this had happened two or three years before . Virginia was ten now . As she dawdled more and more under the tree of knowledge , with an appearance of casualness and one eye always out for the threatening figure of her God , she could not have said what she was finding good and evil to be . Far from saying , she did n't even know . To try to describe her consciousness at this time is like trying to visualize the wind : Something was there ,  | most movingly , most importantly . But this much can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought , which had caused Eve to put on her apron , made Virginia also feel ashamed , being manifestly designed after the human pattern . Yet something in her , defiant of all authority , forewarned her of a day when attraction would overcome her present shame ; when , far from being wrong , this queer repulsive function and instinct would become surpassingly right . She half knew that at some future date and under some unimaginable future circumstances , she would be delivered of this particular sin . But there were other evils which oppressed Virginia , and filled her with dread , and held out no inherent hope of joyful metamorphosis . She found them in all her relatives whom she was supposed to respect and love , and in both her parents whom she was supposed to respect and love and obey , and all around her in her home and status quo . But most of all she found them in her mother , who seemed to her to be their distillation . She could not have named them , she could not have named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the more affrighting for being nameless , she went on trying . She also went on trying because condemnation is the first step toward disobedience . Rebellion has to have a justification . She went on reaching for the knowledge of good and evil , although she was afraid to do it openly as yet . For the knowledge of good and evil is the naming of abstract qualities , the meaning of all creation and its Creator . It is to pass judgment on God Himself as if you were His equal or even His superior . But God is by definition the superior of His children . " And the Lord God said , Behold , the man is become as one of us , to know good and evil . ... Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden . " To accept what you are given and say , " Thank you , " to do what you are told without question , is not to live . It is to die for lack of exercise of all the vital functions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But disobedience is a child 's one sin . He must sin or die . And Virginia with everything in her felt that this was so . But since she could not reason it out , since no theologian yet has reasoned out her dilemma , she stood self-convicted of original sin , and in her efforts to criticize her mother , by way of preparation for rebellion , lived in deepest darkest guilt . Her first awful doubts as to her mother 's perfect goodness arose from Ettie 's favorite role of bona fide Littleton . Virginia herself had once stood in some danger of being six years old and a Littleton  | forever . When Ettie told her children those stories about the South , they had believed them for their own sakes . The fervor with which they were communicated had become an important part of their emotional make-up . And not to have believed them would have deprived the children of an inheritance all the more glorious because it was unreal  --  supernal , irreducible to life size . In the same way that nobody could prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather 's house burned down , neither could anybody prove that the Southern myth was n't all that Southerners said it was after the Civil War . Every Southerner could be descended from a Christian gentleman after the Christian Gentleman Himself was dead ; and as He had been hard to kill , so his ghost promised to be practically immortal . Virginia and Benjamin had believed in Him as their Progenitor and Moral Authority in a much more honorific sense than they ever believed in their real father , just as Perseus and Phaeton had believed their mothers who told them that their fathers were gods . And to cease to believe in Him was to renounce their own prestige as demigods  --  a harder thing to do than anybody would have believed who had not been similarly inoculated with family pride in infancy . A good deal of credit therefore was due Virginia when , little by little and much against her will , she began to try to uproot the Littleton in herself . She never got any credit ; but after many years , her reward was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being stuck in her own pride and her own past , and let her go on growing , as her mother never had gone on . First she came to admit that her mother was no real Littleton , and then ( less readily ) that she herself was no real Littleton , and finally was able to ask herself , who would want to be a Littleton anyway ? Nobody could be a real Littleton any more . The Littletons were all dead now , and the people who bore that name were unrecognizable as what that name had indicated once . Think of Cousin Laura . Virginia had never seen Cousin Laura . But she knew her well as a fictional character . And this fictional character , " Oh , so oogledy-oggledy , always making over everybody , as two-faced as they make ' em , anything to get on the soft side of people and wind ' em round her little finger , and never a thought in her head but beaux ; but , oh , she always had so many pretty dresses , and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good time wherever she went ; I was always mighty fond of Laura " ; this Cousin Laura had little in common with the married woman who , when last heard from , was running a boarding house in Florida . And think of Grandfather Littleton . It hardly seemed possible that his grand-  | father had freed a hundred slaves and more , and even then had had enough to work a large tobacco plantation . Think of Uncle Quilly . And when Virginia thought of Uncle Quilly , she had to laugh . Now there was a Littleton for you . Uncle Quilly , named after his uncle Aquila in Kentucky , was her grandfather 's brother who had married young and gone out to Kansas with the equivalent of two hundred acres in cash . Quilly 's wife , Jenny , came of North Carolina stock . " Oh , have n't I seen the likes of them in Kentucky ? " Ettie said . " Up in the clay hills ! Bowling Green ! Around through there ! The old mossback granddaddy and the poor thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little half-naked younguns , with that fine white hair as straight as a shingle , and their eyes just the color of skim milk ? Law ! " she would say with a shudder . " Do n't I know ' em ? And my hair just stands straight up when I think that the Littleton blood is mixed with such a tribe as that . North Carolina ! Who ever heard of anybody that was anybody coming from North Caro-lina ? " But Uncle Quilly himself was no relative to be proud of . A few years after he had moved to Kansas , he had come back , driven out by drouth , with his gaunt shrewish wife and three children , to live at " Pappy 's . " Roger , his father , had kindly taken them in . But this arrangement Cynthy had not been able to endure . She had persuaded Roger to give Quilly forty acres up the road a way , and build him a small house on them . She also had helped " Quilly 's " with presents of food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cow came fresh , and little pantaloons and dresses as children continued to accumulate . But Quilly remained the family ne'er-do-well . He looked like his father  --  dignity , benignity , whiskers , and all . And his failure to take thought for the morrow was like his father 's , too ; only what was an aristocratic disregard of money-grubbing in Roger had become , with changed conditions , plain shiftlessness in Roger 's oldest son . Once , Cynthy had given Quilly a new black broadcloth overcoat . Soon afterward , Roger had given him a cord of wood . Glancing out of the window , one morning , Cynthy had seen Quilly 's small bony roan horse and rickety unpainted wagon coming up the lane . In the wagon was some of the wood , and on the seat sat Quilly , " as big as Cuffy , " the image of respectable prosperity in his new black broadcloth overcoat . This scandal came to be a family fable illustrative of improvidence . When either of the Lacey children wanted to wear something new for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quilly ! "  | Uncle Quilly 's " raft of children " had all drifted away . He and Aunt Jenny lived by themselves these days . At their Grandmother Littleton 's Virginia and Benjamin were sometimes sent up the road to take Uncle Quilly 's a dozen eggs or a big round pat of butter in a little covered tin bucket . Uncle Quilly 's house was a two-room cottage painted a light pea green with salmon pink trimmings  --  Aunt Jenny 's taste . You might expect as much because Aunt Jenny 's folks had come from North Carolina . But thanks to her , the yard was always full of flowers , and the house inside was as clean as soft soap and brick dust could make it . The big bed in the front room was snowy and speckless , and the starched pillow shams were embroidered in Turkey red flowers and Turkey red lettering which spelled out the split halves of religious quotations appropriate to sleep . The left-hand pillow sham would read : THE DARKNESS DEEPENS . The right-hand pillow sham would read : LORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected because Aunt Jenny 's folks were shouting Methodists . Uncle Quilly was an old man with a short bushy gray beard and gray side whiskers . He wore patched dirty overalls ( with a bib , as the children 's grandfather never would ) and a small brown felt hat with a bunched-up crown and a shredded band . When he came down to return the little tin bucket , he would lower himself into Grandfather Littleton 's rocker , groaning , with one hand on his thigh . " How are you , Quilly ? " their grandmother would ask solicitously . " Aa-a-a , law ! " Uncle Quilly would groan . " I 'm poorly , Nannie , poorly . " If Ettie was there , she would say indignantly after he had left , " Now you know there 's nothing any more the matter with him than the Man in the Moon ! " But Mrs. Littleton would say maliciously , under cover of a sweet smile , " I never see your uncle Quilly , and hear him say , Aa-a-a , law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather Littleton . " And at this Ettie never failed to blaze up . " Now , Muhl " she would say . " You know Grandpap was always cranky about his clothes and his appearance ! I do n't think I ever saw a finer-looking old gentleman . Always so dignified in his black broadcloth and his stock ! And he was always clean . You know how careful he used to be about his beard . He was always and eternally trimming it and washing it . But Uncle Quilly , in those filthy dirty overalls  | and that last year 's birds ' nest of a hat , and that beard of his ! Do you reckon he ever washed it in his life ? " " I could n't say ! " Mrs. Littleton would reply with asperity . She thought Ettie was too hard on Uncle Quilly . But she had suffered because she was no Littleton , and it tickled her as well to think that Uncle Quilly , the old reprobate , was nothing other . It did n't exactly tickle Virginia . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she saw Uncle Quilly for what he was , she caught her mother in a lie ; and in spite of the fearfulness and guilt , this suspicion afforded her a grim satisfaction . Similar suspicions began to peer out at her from behind other circumstances . Now that Ettie had installed herself and family in " our own home , " and had got the Garvin , the next item on her docket was " a trip some place , " since she could never forget that she had missed out on a wedding trip . This summer she finally separated Amos from the creamery and took him on a tour of the Eastern seaboard . The children were sent as a matter of course to stay with their grandmother Littleton . For a good while Ettie had been in correspondence with a cousin of her father 's . Cousin Molly Wilson , who also having wandered from her old Kentucky home and married in Chicago spent her spare time in the university library , looking up data pertaining to Littleton genealogy ? " geneology , " as Ettie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Ettie , a compensating mania . When Cousin Molly heard that Cousin Ettie was going East , she asked her to stop off in Richmond , Virginia , and see if she could find a plaque in the statehouse there , on which were inscribed the names of the companions of John Smith who had come with him to Jamestown in 1611 . One of these was supposedly a Roger Lyttleton . Ettie made a point of executing this important mission . She afterward said that she had found the plaque , that the name of Roger Lyttleton was on it , and that he had been the first of her family to arrive in America . ( He very nearly would have had to be , since among Ettie 's claims to kinship with so many illustrious Virginia names , she had overlooked Powhatan and Pocahontas . ) And the great event of her trip , the principal object of interest on the Atlantic coast , was thenceforth the name of Roger Lyttleton on the plaque in the Richmond statehouse . Of course it could be proved that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the name of the oldest son in the Littleton family . But between 1611 and 1698 was a dark con-  | siderable gap . Besides , Amos , who good-humoredly called his wife " the Kentucky blueblood " by this time , had not gone with her to the statehouse , and was consequently not an accredited witness . There was only Ettie 's word for it that the Littletons had been the F-est possible of F. F. V. 's . " Oh , yes ! " she would exclaim . " You might know the Littletons come from one of those lazy aristocrats that had to have water poured down their sleeves to make ' em work ! Them that wo n't work ca n't eat , ' as John Smith used to say . The only wonder to me is , that the Littleton amongst ' em did n't starve to death ! A lazier old man never lived than my grandfather Littleton . But , oh , how I did love him ! " Just as often , however , she reverted to an earlier version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been Cavaliers who had fled from England when King Charles was beheaded . The absence of authentic records came about from the burning of the courthouse , in which those records were stored , by British soldiers during the War of 1812 , with the humiliating result that Ettie had to join the D. A. R. on the strength of an ancestor who had had the plebeian name of Scruggs and the plebeian rank of private in the Continental Army . ( Cynthy Packer 's mother had been a Scruggs . ) But Ettie got around the destruction of the courthouse and counteracted Scruggs by saying arbitrarily that her Revolutionary Littleton ancestor had been a colonel or a Tory , sometimes one thing and sometimes the other . She preferred him in the latter rfile : " Oh , my , yes ! Most of the best families in Virginia were Tories . You would n't catch them mixing with the common herd ! " Then , fifteen minutes later , she would be saying just as proudly that her father had been named after his great-grandfather , the Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia had no way of knowing that " geneology " was a branch of science in any respect inferior to biology , or that its ramifications and fine points were any less worthy of the most serious study . And certainly Darwin on the subject of natural selection or de Vries on mutations could not have been nearly so striking to the mind of childhood as Ettie holding forth on the subject of Littletons . Her enthusiasm was something to see , or rather feel , for it burst from her with eruptive force . Her big teeth shone in the creases of a set smile . Her eyebrows were rosy with emotion , and the tears stood in her eyes . She breathed short . She screwed her shoulders and thrust forward her bosom in convulsive movements , like Great-aunt Edith , only more so . For the moment she seemed to be in the throes of a slight choreic fit . And as the seizure  | subsided , she sank back in her chair , nodding and smiling and clearing her throat , as if for applause . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie , especially with such emotional abandon . Mothers do not lie . Still Virginia had an appalling intimation that not even a Littleton could have been a companion of John Smith and a Cavalier , or a Revolutionary colonel and a Tory ; and she was sometimes forced to conclude that if her great-great-grandfather had really been the Lee who signed the Declaration of Independence , then surely the glory attaching to this act proceeded from the common herd . Virginia 's reading was extensive . Her reasoning powers were not deficient . She had never quite believed in Santa Claus since she was five years old , when her aunt Weenie , taking her downtown to show her Santa Claus , had overdone a good thing and shown her two . All the way home , Virginia had kept repeating in distress , " But they could n't both be Santy Claus ! " She also recalled passing the living room doorway one afternoon , and overhearing part of a conversation between her mother and a lady caller , a member of the Mothers ' Club . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject somewhat outrageous to Virginia 's sensibilities to begin with . Then she had heard her mother exclaim in dulcet horror , " Oh , strike a child ? Oh , w'y , I think that 's the worst thing a parent can do ! Oh , I agree with you completely there ! " Virginia had placed two lingers across her mouth , still tasting the rust-like flavor of tears and blood . It was true that her mother had never spanked her , if spanking was what was meant by " striking " a child . Nevertheless , as she walked on out the front door , she had been filled with rage . She had thought with furious scorn of her mother , sitting in there , preening and smiling , making up ladylike lies to impress another lady . And now , remembering this experience , she considered the inference that after all her mother might lie about other things as well , a momentous consideration . To catch her mother lying about Littletons was as important to her as it must have been to Einstein to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgraceful , as if those errors had been deliberate deceptions . The truth was equally world-shaking , for Virginia 's world was not very large as yet . The cap-sheaf on all her doubts was a clipping she found inside her mother 's desk . While Ettie still had hopes of entering the D. A. R. as a Littleton instead of as a Scruggs , she had turned up in her spade work an old Littleton still living in Virginia . She had written him several letters , and he had replied , and she was  | just beginning to learn some gratifying facts when his letters suddenly stopped . She wrote and wrote , but he never answered . Then she received a newspaper clipping from the country post office that handled the old gentleman 's mail . She dropped him from her conversation like a hot potato , and hid the clipping in her desk . This was the old stand-up desk in the hall . ( Ettie often told callers that her great-great-grandfather Packer had imported it from England to put the first United States currency in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey . ) Its flap concealed a row of fascinating pigeonholes and little drawers with brass knobs ; and Virginia , disobeying orders , loved to rummage in it . One day , when she was rummaging , she found the clipping which she read with interest and excitement . She took it to her mother for an explanation , and all she got was a furious scolding . But the facts were there , and she remembered how loftily , for a while , her mother had referred to this very Carter Littleton , dragging him by the heels into every conversation ? " the last of the name in Virginia . " He and his brother , said the clipping , had lived together , keeping house and running their little farm with nobody else to help them . They had not spoken to each other for over twenty years . The clipping did not say what they had quarreled about or if they had quarreled again . It emphasized the other brother 's murder . Ettie 's correspondent had become " the last of the name in Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in pieces , burying the pieces in a series of post holes , and then replacing the posts . The owner of the adjacent farm , repairing the fence , had come upon the grisly remains . Owing to Carter 's age  --  he was sixty-eight years old  --  the court had recommended clemency , and the jury had merely sentenced him for life . The country postmaster , as Ettie 's letters continued to arrive , had evidently sent her the newspaper account without comment . " Little farm ! " Virginia thought in dismay the second time she read the clipping . And , " Nobody else to help them ! " She had supposed that " the last of the name in Virginia " had lived on a large plantation ministered to by hundreds of faithful darkies . Certainly her mother 's stories had given her that impression of anybody named Littleton still living in the South . She suddenly felt as if she had had her first clear chill peek at some unadulterated reality or other . This Carter Littleton , poor and old , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she suddenly understood , of all her mother harked back to . Great-uncle Quill , the vestryman of the Episcopal church , mix  | ing his juleps from his little rolling table ; and Cousin John , who said , " I always kill a few extra hogs at butchering because I know the niggers will steal that many anyway " ; and Cousin Lizzie and the dances under the marquee on the lawn ; and Cousin Marg , gay and fat , in her trailing ruffled wrappers ; and Great-aunt Ann with Shug on a pallet beside her bed ; and Great-grandfather Littleton , in his black broadcloth and his stock , who changed his shoes three times a day , and never put a cotton shirt on his back  --  all these came flocking into her mind , all dead now . And there was Cousin Laura , running a boarding house in Florida . And there was Uncle Quilly , the old reprobate , and Grandfather Littleton himself , Francis Lightfoot Lee Littleton , living or rather dying in contented poverty . Dead men , dead beats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but be gay in such a jocund company . It even occurred to Virginia that it was always her mother who told that story about the cedar tree in Grandfather Littleton 's yard . Nobody else ever mentioned it . Virginia had often swung in a stiff loop of the wild grapevine that overmantled it . She had taken a sort of pleasure in its present tangibility and its past incarnations , as if she saw this real perceptible thing , not only as its individual self , but repeated through refractions of refractions of time . But now , though there was no sign on it announcing that it was not a lineal descendant of the Washington cedar rooted on the Potomac , she began to wonder if its genus and location had not simply paralleled the original legend too temptingly for her mother to resist lying about it . For it was dawning on her that the most frightening thing about her mother was that ability to believe whatever she wanted to believe . What was this mysterious thing , " good blood , " she asked herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward and visible signs , this inherited prestige which could raise a woman like her mother above people who had had to work for what they much more admirably were and what they much more admirably had ? If it was some innate compulsion to be like any Littleton Virginia had ever seen , then she cursed her fate . But if nobody , actually and really , could be a Littleton any more , as Virginia was painfully but hopefully coming to believe , if Cynthy Packer had successfully killed off Littletons , then Virginia had to accept her mother for the appalling fake she was . When Amos had counted on annexing Ettie 's gentility and worldly experience without their guilt , he had not supposed that he had necessarily relinquished to her his own Quakerish demo-  | cratic convictions . He had taken it for granted that he could retain them . But , in actuality , just as his decision to be a businessman had brought about the desirability of gentility and worldly experience , so business prevented him from retaining anything of himself except the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest to his wife . He had not intended to do so . And his doing so was not , in the main , his personal fault . Many circumstances had been for a long time heading up into his present situation : extreme Protestantism , for one thing , that held that moral liberty and equality are universal , and therefore feminine as well as masculine ; and for another thing , the emergence of the Protestant male as more and more the typical businessman . With every business enterprise which had become more than a shop on the premises , more businessmen had been compelled to separate their offices and warehouses from their homes . " The City " and Wall Street ' were not domestic institutions . Neither were the docks at East Ham and Hoboken , nor the Pittsburgh steel mills nor the Chicago stockyards . Neither was the Lacey Milk Company . Unlike his father and his grandfathers and all his other male ancestors , British or American , gentle or simple , Amos was obliged to earn his living at a distance from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a business so trifling that he could have done otherwise . His daily absence , the same that exempted Benjamin from being levied on to help his father , but did not exempt Virginia from having to help her mother , had caused Amos to delegate all domestic authority to Ettie . And his vestigial notions of moral liberty and equality , inherent in his religion , may have reconciled him to the delegation . It was all right for the process of making money , divorced from purpose or source , to become the American male 's unique concern . And masculine vanity being what it is , it was all right for everything else to become therefore unworthy of masculine attention ? for civilization in a qualitative sense to be left to the patronage of mothers and housewives in their spare time . It was all right for goodness and beauty and thought , the meaning of life itself , to be handed over by husbands to their wives ; so that within this narrow domestic sphere Ettie 's rule was absolute . This was how it happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-fourths of all the God Virginia knew , and that the " ought " she learned in childhood , being mainly feminine and maternal , was a routine of chores and trivialities . For till recently the things of the spirit had been a masculine monopoly , and  | women did not learn their nurture overnight . Like every other woman since the days of matriarchy and savagery , since human beings had discovered the fact of paternity and had named the father their Creator and Authority , Ettie had never been encouraged to take any serious view of herself . She was conceded to have chores or " accomplishments , " but never achievements . Her work was by definition menial or trivial . Consequently , when goodness and beauty and thought were given her to tend , she never imagined that they would have been given to her if they had been of any intrinsic importance . But gentility was masculine in origin and money was still masculine in fact ; and so the one utility for her children 's manners , schooling , dress , churchgoing , parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent wrapping for the two commodities important in themselves : snobbery and money . And the chance to exhibit her snobbery and money was the sole excuse for all her own activities . She hurried from committee to committee and from meeting to meeting . Church work , charities , club work , kept her as busy as a bird dog ; and she might as well have been a bird dog for all the understanding she had of what she was supposed to be doing and why she was supposed to be doing it . As for Amos , that fanatically hard-working man , giving all his life to turning out the largest possible amounts of milk and butter and ice cream at the highest possible profit , he would never have admitted that he lived , as Ettie and his children lived , for the display of snobbery and money . But what else did he live for ? He could not have told you . 3 IT WAS Ettie 's claims to gentility as a Littleton and to money and local social position as a Charles on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for a while afterward , it had seemed to her that his own profound respect for money and his uncle Dick 's money and social position in Median were sure to be valuable additions to these claims . But she soon found out that Amos stood in the way of her social ambitions  | because he was quite helplessly too much of a Quaker . He could not have danced or played cards or golf to save his life . As for those social icebreakers and chemical persuasives to brotherhood , alcohol and nicotine , they were downright immoral in his eyes . Thus he was unable to make use of Ettie 's gentility and worldly experience for which he had traded so much ; and his own Quakerism left him also in the lurch . Virginia , in the midst of her first defiant guilty doubts about her mother , consequently doubting the essential value of gentility and money , had inconsistently begun to criticize her father because he was unable to make use of gentility and money and doomed his family to social isolation . ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely . ) Listening to her mother and the gossip of the Charleses , she was already learning that there existed in Median an upper layer of people who all knew one another , and went to one another 's parties , and took a microscopic interest in one another 's doings . Virginia had been born into a position where you had to be a snpb in order to have any human intercourse at all . Either that , or you confined yourself to the neighborhood in which you lived ; and in a city , a neighborhood was not a social unit . Besides , so far as Virginia was concerned , her mother 's snobbery was not an Open Sesame to Parkway Avenue , but , rather , a barrier to it , and cut Virginia off from the other children on the block as much as some of her father 's Quakerish notions . In her longing for friends , Virginia hated her father 's lack of snobbery almost as much as , for other reasons , she hated snobbery in her mother . When it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be damned if you do n't ; another dilemma between whose prongs she stood unhappy and bewildered . Ettie would have liked to play bridge , though not for prizes of course . Playing bridge for prizes , let alone for money , was " a form of gambling " which all the best families of Median frowned upon . But when she thought of Amos 's mute disgust , she had n't the bravery to begin . She would have loved to be a patroness of the Charity Ball and had had a couple of invitations . But Amos would hardly ever go out at night , and nobody could have dragged him ito a Charity Ball , especially at the price . ( Ten dollars , please , to be a patron . ) When Amos 's uncle Dick became a charter member of the golf club , and wanted Amos to become a member , too , Ettie urged her husband night and day : " Now why wo n't you , Amos ? I would if I were you . Think how much good it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while ! All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy ! "  | Uncle Dick still belonged to the First Friends ' Church . He was , in fact , one of its most prominent members , not a working member , but a heavy contributor to the funds and an ornament to the congregation . It was quite a sight to see him coming down the center aisle , tall , rosy , corpulent , and handsome , herding before him " me women , " as he called them  --  his well-dressed wife , Aunt Ruth , his well-dressed daughter , Lillian , and sometimes his welldressed little granddaughters  --  while his well-dressed son-in-law walked proudly at his heels . Besides his membership in the Society of Friends , however , what else of a Quaker there was about him was not very evident . He loved going to the theater , where he sat in a box surrounded by his family . He loved comfort and highly seasoned food , and cheerfully said that he was digging his grave with his teeth . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarpon , leaving Amos to manage the creamery . He went to Michigan every summer , where he owned a " cottage " and a launch , leaving Amos to manage the creamery . Ettie was anxious for Amos- to join the golf club because then she would have some excuse for a little social expansion herself . But Amos ruined all her chances by saying to his uncle Dick , who already had some tweed knickerbockers in the making at Altgelt 's , " You 'll be wanting me to buy myself a pair of short pants next ! " Also : " You go ahead and do the social stunt , and I 'll stay in the back room where I belong " ? a speech which pleased his uncle even less . " Oh , fudge , boy ! " said Uncle Dick . " You 'll be doing the business more good out there on the golf course than stuck in that back room all the time . W'y , man alive , all the businessmen in town that amount to anything are going to belong ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now do n't misunderstand me , " he said with a great show of fair-mindedness . And in truth he was loyal to his uncle Dick . Next to Amos 's father , Uncle Dick could do no wrong . " I 'm not saying it 's not the right thing for you to do . You like to mix . You enjoy going out amongst ' em . And that 's all right ! There 's nothing the matter with that ! As long as a man is open and aboveboard about it . But most of these backslappers ? ! I never was much account at the laying on of hands . Oh , I 'll do business with ' em . I 'll do business with the Old Scratch as long as he pays his bills . But when it comes to mixing to get the business , well , that 's a dirty kind of shenanigans I do n't want to have anything to do with . Robert Lacey " ?
