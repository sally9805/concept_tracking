Lack of Unity <P> Sirs : <P> . . . In TIME , June 8 you say , in part : " The winning of the war has not begun and . . . its losing has gone on apace . . . . Last fortnight came evidence that the Navy is keeping secrets from its Army superiors even in the vital Canal Zone . " <P> It is these things , and others like them , which keep me and my wife , with three sons in the Air Corps , and two others to go , and five nephews now in , worried unnecessarily , and miserable . Thousands of parents feel as we do . Please hammer away at this lack of unity . Surely somebody can do something about it . <P> R. D. BAKER <P> Warren , Pa . <P> Sirs : <P> What in hell are we supposed to do , sit and wait for another " bloody monument to divided responsibility , " as Pearl Harbor is described by Colonel Hugh J. Knerr TIME , June 1 , before the powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional arguing and realize the vulnerability their collaboration deems ? <P> Of all things to be bickering about , air power , the very lifeline of the efforts of both their forces ! General Headquarters demanded satisfaction after Pearl Harbor . Let 's investigate Colonel Knerr 's theme before another large-scale investigation is necessary . <P> -* <P> Military Police Detachment <P> Camp Polk , La . <P> &gt; A lot of Army-Navy-Air cooperation is still lacking , but there were some healthy signs of its beginning at Midway on June 3. - ED . <P> Rationing in S. A. <P> Sirs : <P> All petroleum products transported by tankers are being rationed in Central and South America , and the Caribbean . As a fine example of cooperation , I quote below a letter written by President Martinez of El Salvador , which has just crossed my desk : <P> " President of the Economic Coordination Committee , <P> Dear Sir : <P> With regard to rationing of petroleum products for agriculture , I take pleasure in attaching a detailed statement of the consumption of oil , gasoline , and greases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Department of La Paz . <P> I have in use two tractors : one ' Caterpillar ' 4O-h.p. diesel , 1937 model , and another a John Deere diesel model ' A ' , I also have a 10-h.p. diesel motor for other purposes . <P> As in past years , I desire to plant 200 manzanas ( 346 acres ) of cotton of the coming crop . <P> Hoping that the information given will be sufficient to enable you to ' assign me the proper quota for this year , and thanking you in advance for whatever attention this request may merit , I am your servant and good friend , <P> MAXIMILIANO H. MARTINEZ " <P> You will note that this letter is signed by General Martinez as a simple citizen and not as President of the Republic . Contrast his attitude with that of the fuss made by our Senators and Congressmen and others in position over " X " cards , so well described in the last two or three Air-Express editions of TIME . <P> D.
