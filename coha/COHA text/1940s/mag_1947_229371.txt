You fancy me mad . Madmen know nothing . But you should have seen me . You should have seen how wisely I proceeded - with what caution - with what foresight - with what dissimulation I went to work . . . Oh , you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in ! <P> - The Tell-Tale Heart <P> Fictional characters like Poe 's stealthy stabber have given many a whodunit fan the notion that an insane murderer is " fiendishly clever " in planning and executing his crimes . Poppycock , say two psychiatric authorities in a recent issue of the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology . <P> Dr. Louis Cohen , who teaches legal psychiatry at Yale , and Dr. Thomas Coffin , assistant professor of psychology at Hofstra College , riffled through the clues left by 18 psychotic murderers . Their conclusion : mad killers seem to commit their murders in a distinct pattern ; there is seldom enough method in their madness to fool the dumbest flatfoot . <P> In choosing his victim , say Drs . Cohen &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , mother , sister or in-laws are favorites . The murder is often premeditated ( one psychotic prepared again &; again to kill his girl , but could not bring himself to do it when she was in a happy frame of mind ; finally one night , when she was sad , he got it over with ) . But the crime is seldom shrewdly planned ; many psychotic murderers operate in broad daylight , in public places , using any weapon that happens to come to hand . Another characteristic clue left by the mad killer is unnecessary roughness ( cutting the body into ribbons or stuffing it into a drainpipe ) . Since the psychotic lives in a private world , he hardly ever has accomplices. * <P> Far from concealing the clues and making a crafty getaway , the mad murderer is usually indifferent about being arrested . Often , like Dostoevsky 's Raskolnikov , he is anxious for his crime to be followed by punishment . <P> The psychotic never murders for personal gain . He has his motives , but they make little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet De Quincey 's standards ( " . . . Something more goes into the composition of a fine murder than two blockheads to kill and be killed . " ) Cohen &; Coffin tell of a boy who hit his employer over the head several times with a hammer , stabbed him repeatedly with a hunting knife , and explained : " I just felt like doing it . " <P> In almost every murder trial , someone raises the question : is the defendant sane ? Drs . Cohen &; Coffin think it might be easy to tell after a look at the crime itself ; if it conforms closely to the psychotic pattern , the murderer is probably insane . If such tests became common , could a sane murderer pass himself off as a crazy man by deliberately mimicking the psychotic pattern ? Not likely , think Cohen &; Coffin : a murderer in his right mind has a certain hesitancy about carving up his female relatives in the town square at high noon . <P> <P> * Edmund Pearson , summing up the findings of othere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy of any murderer who follows three simple rules : 1 ) show no remorse , 2 ) take no accomplices , 3 ) keep your head .
