Planes and personnel of NATS and ATS would be combined to form the Military Air Transport Service , under the command of the Air Force . The new service would fly all scheduled routes now flown by the separate services , but both would continue to operate transport planes for strictly intra-service purposes . <P> The man named to command MATS was lean , able Major General Laurence S. Kuter , U.S. representative to the International Civil Aviation Organization in Montreal , who recently turned down a post as CAB chairman , when the Senate refused to let him keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would take over the command of MATS on March 1 .
