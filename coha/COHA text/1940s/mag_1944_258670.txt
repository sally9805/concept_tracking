" We lack food and medical supplies . Warsaw is lying in ruins . The Germans are murdering the wounded in the hospitals . They are driving women and children before their tanks as screens . Our sons are dying . The help that has come from Great Britain is insufficient . Hear us - Holy Father , Vicar of Christ . " <P> This despairing cry of a nation in agony , slicing through the international joy over the liberation of Paris , was radioed last week to Pope Pius XII in the name of the women of Warsaw . <P> In Warsaw , as in Paris , the underground had risen prematurely . But in Paris the U.S. and French forces had arrived in the nick of time to save the patriots . In Warsaw , no rescue had come to the underground forces of General Bors , which for a month had stood off the German Army . RAF flyers in Italy had made the 1,750-mile round trip to drop supplies and a few weapons ( TIME , Aug. 28 ) . So far the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> On Aug. 23 , 1939 , Joachim von Ribbentrop and Viacheslav Molotov had signed the Russian-German pact in Moscow . Twelve hours after its ratification on Aug. 31 , Hitler gave the signal that sent the German armored divisions rumbling across the frontier against the Polish cavalry , the Luftwaffe against the all but defenseless Polish cities . Thus , on the fifth anniversary of World War II , the war was back where it started . <P> It was an anniversary exultant with victory , jubilant with the hope that the war was nearing its end as the Allies harried the Germans through France , the Russians smashed through the Galati Gap and Hitler 's Balkan outworks began to crumble . It was also a moment for glancing at the war 's score . <P> And yet , last week , while delirious Frenchmen danced and kissed , Germans stared stolidly into blackness and even Britons wondered . For as the war 's fifth birthday came round , the British , like the Germans , were tired . Buzz-bombs were worse than the blitz . And Britons worried over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even victory would mean a national tragedy . For France , it was a vast question mark . Ever since the blitz failed the British had known that victory would one day be theirs , as the Germans after Stalingrad and North Africa had glimpsed the spectre of defeat . And they knew something else-at once comforting and alarming . <P> Deep down , Britons and Germans sensed that they would never again collide over the domination of Europe . Five years of war had left only two giants in the world 's arena . The future lay between Russia and the U.S.
