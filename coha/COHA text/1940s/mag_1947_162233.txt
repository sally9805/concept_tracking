In the mountain wood lots that ring Nova Scotia 's Annapolis Valley , it was Christmas-tree harvest time . During the summer , lanky Bruce Swinamer , 43 , had been out spotting likely trees for the trade . Last week , his boss , a New Yorker named Willis ( " Christmas Tree " ) Clark , checked into the Cornwallis Inn at Kent-ille , got set for the cutting of 125,000 balsams for the city market . <P> Clark was only one of several American tree-buyers busy in Nova Scotia . This year the province expects to ship 2,000,000 trees to the U.S. , up 100,000 over 1946 . The trees will find their way into homes as far away as Miami and St. Louis . <P> In Prince Edward Island , New Brunswick , Quebec , Ontario and British Columbia , tree dealers were busy in the woodlands . Last year , the Dominion sent 7,143,525 firs and Scotch pines across the border , valued at $1,839,000 . This year , the take may exceed $2,000,000.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
