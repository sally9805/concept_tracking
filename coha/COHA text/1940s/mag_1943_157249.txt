To answer some of the questions our subscribers have been asking about how TIME gathers , verifies , writes and distributes its news . <P> TIME is 20 years old this week , and for a month now I have been wondering what I should say to you on our Anniversary , to show our appreciation for the truly extraordinary loyalty and interest with which our subscribers have now backed us through two decades . <P> Perhaps the best thing I can do is just to quote a few paragraphs from TIME 'S original prospectus and to reaffirm our faith in the journalistic concepts and ideals on which TIME started : <P> " Although daily journalism has been more highly developed in the United States than in any other country of the world-people in America are , for the most part , poorly informed . <P> " This is not the fault of the daily newspapers ; they print all the news . It is not the fault of the weekly ' reviews ' ; they adequately develop and comment on the news . The reason people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time which busy men are able to spend on simply keeping informed . <P> " TIME is a weekly newsmagazine , aimed to serve the modern necessity of keeping people informed . It is created on a new principle of complete organization of the news . <P> " TIME is interested-not in how much it includes between its covers-but in how much it gets off its pages into the minds of its readers . <P> " No article will be written to prove any special case . But the editors recognize that complete neutrality on public questions and important news is probably as undesirable as it is impossible , and are therefore ready to acknowledge certain prejudices which may in varying measure predetermine their opinions on the news . <P> " A catalogue of these prejudices would include such phrases as : <P> 1 . A belief that the world is round and an admiration of the statesman 's ' view of all the world . ' <P> 2 . A general distrust of the present tendency toward increasing interference by government . <P> 3 . A prejudice against the rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things which money can not buy . <P> 5 . A respect for the old , particularly in manners . <P> 6 . An interest in the new , particularly in ideas . <P> " But this magazine is not founded to promulgate prejudices , liberal or conservative . The magazine is one of news , not argument , and verges on the controversial only where it is necessary to point out what that news means . ' To keep men well-informed ' - that , first and last , is the only axe this magazine has to grind . " <P> Since those paragraphs were written , the concept of TIME has grown and deepened . The world TIME reports in 1943 is a world whose knaves and good men , fools and heroes play their parts on a stage whose backdrop is literally life-and-death . In reporting this grave new world TIME still hews to its original line : we have not changed our axe but sharpened it . With 55 writers , 58 researchers , 22 branch offices and 201 correspondents all over the world , obviously we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than our four full-time editors and their ten part-time assistants could hope to do back in 1923 . <P> But TIME still has only one aim-to help busy , intelligent people get the news and as much of its meaning as diligent reporting can discover . <P> Cordially
