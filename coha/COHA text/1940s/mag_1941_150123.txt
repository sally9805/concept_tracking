How Did He Look ( Joan Merrill ; Bluebird ) . The torch record that is putting nickels into the nation 's juke boxes . As a result , choke-making Songstress Merrill is looking toward Hollywood . <P> Linger Awhile ( Rex Stewart ; Bluebird ) . Most clarified hot-of-the-month , with many good solos , including Colorado-Claro Stewart 's strong trumpet . <P> Lady in the Dark Album ( Decca ) . Sibilant Hildegarde sings the Gertrude Lawrence part of the Hart-Gershwin-Weill musical . In the main , German Composer Kurt Weill has a baboo approach to U. S. musical idiom , e.g. , Saga of Jenny , My Ship , This Is New . Good enough for anyone 's piano is One Life To Live . <P> Amapola ( Jimmy Dorsey ; Decca ) . Every company has disced a steal of this Latin classic , of which Dorsey 's seems most earful .
