Last week University of Minnesota 's Minnesota Daily celebrated its 40th birthday by putting out an anniversary issue , throwing a party in its elegant new offices , burning a battered , initial-scarred copy desk in front of its old quarters . <P> Daily editors were almost as proud of their new home in the Journalism building as they were of their 16,500 readers. * <P> They occupy an air-conditioned basement wing with soundproof ceilings , glass brick partitions , a dark room , library , reception room with a co-ed receptionist . <P> The new building cost $275,000 . The Daily itself contributed $25,000 , the rest came from a $350,000 bequest ( now grown to $660,000 ) from late , great Minnesotan William James Murphy of the Minneapolis Tribune . <P> The Daily has won many a campaign . Back in the ' 20s the Daily demanded fire escapes for students ' rooming houses , got what it wanted when a house converted into a dormitory burned up . A recent series of indignant stories provoked a faculty investigation of all housing conditions . Currently the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Minneapolis reduced for students . <P> The paper 's expenditures last year came to about $42,000 , income was approximately $42,900 . Salaries range downward from the editor 's $75 a month to $12 a month for the women 's editor , less for salesmen , clerks , stenographers . <P> Editor Charles Wesley Roberts is a thin , angular senior with a shrewd , Yankee face , a native of Evanston , Ill . After one term at the University of Illinois he transferred to Minnesota so that he could study such nontechnical journalistic subjects as Press &; Public Opinion , Contemporary Affairs . <P> When last fall the Daily published two editions simultaneously for a fortnight , one standard size , one tabloid , Editor Roberts was almost the sole member of his staff who liked the tabloid . Groaned diehard foes of tabloid journalism : " To hell with the doily-we want our Daily back ! " But Minnesota 's students voted 4,231 to 2,941 to have a tabloid-and got it . <P> Wrote Editor Roberts , in words that many a worried publisher might echo : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Daily staff was very nearly complacent in the belief that it was getting out the best newspaper it could . Now we know that there was and is room for improvement . . . . " <P> *Unlike such a paper as The Dartmouth ( which serves the town of Hanover , N. H. ) , Minnesota 's Daily is exclusively a campus journal .
