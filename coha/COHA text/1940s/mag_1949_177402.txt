On its soth anniversary this week , Packard proudly unveiled its first 1949 models . On the outside , they looked much the same as the old ones . But under the floorboards there was something to send rival automakers back to their drawing boards . Packard had come out with a new automatic shift-and those who had driven it gave it the edge on Buick 's Dynaflow . The shift will be standard on the highest-priced line , the Custom 8s , optional on the lower-priced Supers . <P> Packard had developed the shift three years ago but kept it out of its cars as long as the seller 's market lasted . Now , with all other automakers bringing out similar shifts-or developing them-Packard hustled out its own . <P> Like the Dynaflow , the Ultramatic uses oil-driven turbines to transmit the engine 's power to the wheels without the use of gears . But it also eliminates Dynaflow 's one drawback : a slight feeling of " mushiness " or power wastage during acceleration . The Ultramatic overcomes this by having , in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car into direct drive when a certain speed is reached , thus eliminating slipping . At any speed between 15 and 55 m.p.h. , the motorist can also switch from hydraulic to direct mechanical drive by momentarily raising the accelerator . <P> The brains behind the new transmission , like those behind many another Packard innovation , belong to Colonel Jesse G. Vincent , Packard 's chief engineer . Unlike most engineers , Vincent never attended college ; he quit school after the eighth grade , got his degree from a correspondence school . After a stint with Burroughs Adding Machine Co. and one with the Hudson Motor Car Co. , he joined Packard in 1912 , became a vice president three years later , specializing in engines . <P> During World War I he was co-designer of the famed Liberty engines , developed Packard 's Twin6 in 1915 ( first U.S. 12-cylinder production car ) and helped develop engines for Gar Wood 's 125-m.p.h. speedboats . During World War II , he redesigned Rolls-Royce 's Merlin aircraft engine ( used in P-51s and Spitfires ) so that it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vincent once took such a battering from Gar Wood 's backwash that he emerged from the cockpit of his boat black &; blue , and groaned : " I 'm through with this . I 'll fly airplanes . " Fly them he did until four years ago when he turned 65 and felt he " should depend . . . on the skill of someone else much younger . " Packard is still depending on Vincent 's skill . It set a postwar Packard record by selling 11,594 cars in March .
