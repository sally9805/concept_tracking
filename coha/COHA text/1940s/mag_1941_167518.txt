Many a concert classic has been swung higher than Obadiah , but last week a Tchaikovsky theme was swung five different ways at once . The Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto in B Flat Minor , played straight , had its popular start in the movies last spring ; Mary Astor 's make-believe pounding of it in The Great Lie got it widely known as " the Mary Astor Concerto . " Freddie Martin recorded it , but neglected to give it lyrics which could be copyrighted . So by last week there were four competing versions : <P> &gt; Woody Herman ( Decca ) gave his the most accurate title : Concerto No. 1 , B Flat Minor . <P> &gt; Guy Lombardo ( Decca ) called his version Concerto . <P> &gt; Tony Martin 's ( Decca ) was a song , Tonight We Love . <P> &gt;Best record of the lot was Concerto for Two ( Columbia ) , in a subtle arrangement by the fine new band led by piano-playing Claude Thornhill . <P> &gt; From many a U.S. jukebox , in strict dance time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piano Concerto in B Flat , had moved in among the ten best nickel pullers.
