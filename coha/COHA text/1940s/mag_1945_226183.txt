The Virgin of Quinche ( rhymes with keen shay ) , a rejected piece of religious statuary which a sculptor had traded to the Indians of Ayacachi in 1586 for a few pieces of lumber , was credited with miraculous powers . She could cure fistulas and the pox and prevent disasters as well . Last week the Virgin of Quinche figured in the greatest railway disaster in Ecuador 's history . <P> North of Quito , an old , worn-out locomotive huffed and puffed its way through steep mountain passes , carrying faithful Quitenos on their annual pilgrimage to the Virgin 's upland shrine . Eating , singing and chattering pilgrims jammed the seats and aisles of the ancient wooden coaches , clung to roofs , windows and couplings . <P> Suddenly a coupling parted . The heavily loaded car rolled back , jumped the track and plunged down the mountainside . Of the 400 in and on the car , 114 were killed and 206 injured . A pregnant woman who had been riding on the roof gave birth to her child in the wreckage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national day of mourning . Neighboring countries rushed plasma and medicines . Railway men doubted that even Quinche 's famed Virgin could prevent railway disasters until Ecuador could buy new rolling stock and spare parts from the U.S.
