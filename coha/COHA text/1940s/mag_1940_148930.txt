This spring , platinum-polled Leopold Stokowski toured the U. S. , gave auditions to 500 aspirants to the " All American Youth Orchestra " which he plans to take to South America . Although he had set age limits ( 15 to 25 ) , he stretched the limit after hearing , in Detroit , a 14-year-old Negro trumpeter named William B. Horner Jr . Last week , Trumpeter Horner 's name was on the list of 84 winners announced by Conductor Stokowski in Manhattan . The other players , although they came from all over the U. S. , were by no means all young , or cornfed , or self-taught . There were young players from recognized orchestras , students from conservatories like Philadelphia 's Curtis Institute , 14 players from around New York . <P> Of his orchestra , which will make its debut in Washington before embarking for South America in mid-July , Stokowski exclaimed : " I expected to find great talent , but I have found more and a higher type of talent than even I believed existed . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed in previous generations in our country . A great flowering of Art is just beginning in America , and it is expressing itself first through Music . "
