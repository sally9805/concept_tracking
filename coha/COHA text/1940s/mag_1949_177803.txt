The meeting started ten minutes late . ( Some people thought it was really ten years late , or ten centuries . ) In a solemn procession led by parliamentary messengers , who looked like headwaiters except for their chains of office , walked France 's mastiff-faced Edouard Herriot . He climbed the rostrum , opened the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe . <P> " All creation , even the birth of a child , entails some risk , " he said . " The Assembly will be what your determination makes it . " <P> Rambunctious Rebellion . The Assembly last week showed that it had determination . Belgium 's Paul-Henri Spaak had relinquished public office at home just in time to be elected first president of the Assembly . His first act was to call for a short , practicable agenda . The Assembly rambunctiously rebelled against the Committee of Ministers , which has power to tell the Assembly what it can and can not talk about . Cried Winston Churchill : " Why all this interference with the freedom of discussion ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' approval of a nine-point agenda ( six points more than the ministers first proposed ) , including " human rights &; fundamental freedoms . " <P> The delegates at Strasbourg were all shades , from blond Scandinavians through coffee-colored Turks to the two Senegalese members of the French delegation . Cracked a newsman : " About the only thing they have in common is monogamy . " <P> Election of a Brave . Actually they had other things in common : fear of Russia , fear ( in some cases ) of a resurgent Germany , fear of economic collapse . They also shared a vague pride in being citizens of what Churchill calls the famous continent , Europe . The minor squabbles between British Laborites and Tories at the conference showed clearly that the representatives of sovereign nations could act not as members of a British ( or French or Belgian ) bloc , but as Europeans with individual convictions . <P> When Churchill battled Herbert Morrison over a relatively unimportant issue ( whether or not Laborite William Whiteley should be elected to an Assembly vice presidency ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something very like an international parliament . In the corridor outside the assembly hall , in plain view of all Europe , Churchill grabbed the lapels of Liberal Lord Layton , whom he backed against Whiteley . " If you rat on me now in spite of our 40 years ' friendship , " hissed Churchill , " I will never speak to you again . " Tory delegates patrolled the corridors , lobbying for Layton . Two Danes asked in French whether this man Layton really deserved their vote , and a British Tory replied suavely : " Ah , mais oui , c'est un brave-he 's a good guy . " <P> Le brave was elected . <P> Sacred Loyalty . At week 's end , Churchill addressed 20,000 people in Strasbourg 's main square , after being resoundingly bussed by a young Strasbourgeoise . " Prenez garde , je vais parler fran-ais , " warned Churchill ( " Look out ! I 'm going to speak in French " ) .                 @ @ @ @
