This week hundreds of thousands of London children will see a wonder they have never seen before ( or can not remember seeing ) -a lighted city . This week the lights will go on again in London . They will not all go on , yet-but the five years ( 1,843 nights ) of total blackout will be over . <P> The buzz-bombs have stopped coming too . With gigantic strides the war was moving back where it came from-Europe . Britons were stirred , in different ways . An anonymous London Times poet wrote : " We thank thee , London , for thy constancy , There 's not a heart today but to thee <P> draws " So speak the voices , and I love their <P> thanks . What now are weedy courts and shrines <P> forlorn ? <P> Does not my Thames between his seaward banks Flow all the prouder this September <P> morn ? <P> A less-emotional Yorkshireman , Professor Thomas Edmund Jessop of Hull University , wagged a warning finger at possible postwar nerves . Said he : " The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude toward events . . . . The machine is going too fast for the average human mind and the strain may prove too great . " <P> Standing at his window the night that World War I began , Sir Edward Grey had said : " The lamps are going out all over Europe ; we shall not see them lit again in our life time . " <P> Britain was still Britain , but Sir Edward Grey 's times were gone forever . He had been right ; but in London , at least , the lights were coming on again at last . <P> <P> Food <P> Hey , Yank , <P> Got a franc ? <P> Hey , chum , <P> Got some gum ? <P> Big-eyed , bony Belgian children had learned enough English last week to chant such rhymes to Tommies and G.I.s , who tossed them chewing gum , hard candy , field rations . But what the youngsters needed was milk and oranges . Some 50% of them had rickets . <P> The Belgian children were not the worst off in Western Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced , the hungrier they found the population . Imported food was a necessity . Food was also politics , for the lack of food could lead to unrest and delay Europe 's rehabilitation . <P> To many an Allied observer , fresh from belt-tightened Britain , Europe 's farms looked unexpectedly lush and prosperous , Europeans looked surprisingly healthy and well-fed . Much of the appearance was misleading . In Western Europe , the well-to-do had enough to eat . But among the poorer population , particularly in the city slums , there was not enough food . Nowhere did the liberators see starvation . But constant semi-starvation and diet deficiencies were leaving their mark on a whole European generation . <P> Horse Meat Helps . Almost half of France 's newborn babies were underweight , and the child death rate had increased by 25% . Tuberculosis deaths were up 51% . The Germans had drained off dairy products , livestock ( a quarter of France 's cattle , a third of her draft animals ) , huge quantities of wine ( for the Wehrmacht : 60,000 bottles of champagne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specify the vintage years , did not get the best ) . Last week in towns where retreating Germans left dead horses on the street , the inhabitants eagerly butchered the carcasses ( see cut ) .
