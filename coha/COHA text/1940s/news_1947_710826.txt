The plane dived into the ground while in its approach glide to the federal emergency airport . In a dramatic and heart-breaking prelude to the tragedy , the crew struggled gallantly for about 12 minutes before the DC-6 plane of the type that crashed to Utah yesterday . crash to land the big 300 mile an hour transcontinental air liner safely after fire broke out in a belly baggage compartment back near the tail . Race Almost Won Witnesses said the captain , E. L. ( Scotty ) , one of the line 's veteran senior pilots , almost yon his race against the flames . They indicated that the crash was due to the burning thru of tail control lines or structural fgilure in the tail itself as a result of the fiery destruction within . The big craft smashed to bits against a rolling hill less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio ruessages to United 's Salt Lake City dispatcher tell the story and indicate the cold , calculated courage of the crew members in their hopeless trial .

They reported it was trailing smoke and flames , seemingly- from the tail . They Gad been alerted and were standitg by with fire-fighting equipment , but did not see the final dire because the plane had passed behind a rise in ground craft fell . The Bryce Canyon field is on a level ridge , 7,586 feet above sea level , near the East Fork Sevier river . Surrounding it are some of tile most rugged mountains of the western United States with many peaks rising above 11,000 feet . The airport is near one entrance to Bryce Can . yon National park . Cruises at 19,000 Feet The big plane was flying one of United 's premier trips and carrying many wealthy and important passengers from Chicago , Cleveland , Philadelphit. and other eastern cities . It left Los Angeles bound non , stop to Chicago at 11:23 a. m . CST . This was one hour and 10 minutes behind schedule but United officials said the delay was caused by malfunctioning of an accessory pump that was replaced . As usual the plane climbed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to cruise at 300 miles an hour while the passengers remained comfortable . Apparently all was normal until the pilots saw a smoke warning light flashing on the instrument panel . This device warned them that n fire had broken out in the after baggage compartment . It Is believed that they radioed their situation and commenced II long dive toward the emergency field as soon as this fire was discovered . The craft was equipped with the most complete fire exalt. guishing equipment designed and the pilots undoubtedly used it to flood the baggage compartment with an inert gas  --  presumed to have been carbon-dioxide . Normally this would have smothered any fire within the pressure hull of the cabin as both the forward and after baggage compartments are . turns Thru Outer Skin Apparently , however , the fire had gained sufficient headway by the time it was discovered to burn thru the duralumin outer skin . This perrilltted the fire to feed on air of the slipstream . Ground witnesses said they saw flames under the tall . J , A , Simpson of Puyallup , Wash. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he saw several objects fail from the tail of the plane as it passed overhead . Tropic is a cross-roads community 10 miles due south of Bryce Canyon emergency field and many persons in the towji saw the air liner , streaming fire , fly northward over it toward the airport which is the only landing area of its kind in 50 miles . A very high frequency radio range station lies just off the field and apparently the airplane 's pilots were homing on it when they turned northward over Tropic . Bryce Canyon emergency field is right on the great-circle course between Los Angeles and Chicago and approximately 275 miles due south of Salt Lake City , Utah . The trip was exactly on course when the fire was discovered , and less than 10 miles south of the field on the right hand side of the airway  --  which is the proper side for the flight to be holding . Blast Shakes Houses At Bryce Canyon , five miles south ' of the emergency field , the air liner was much lower . Mrs. L. S. Steed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of her ' employees , Robert Middleton and Weldon Le Fevre , heard the thunder-clap crash as the plane hit the ground . The concussion shook every house in the settlement , they said . " Mrs. Steed told us : ' Grab some fire extinguishers , boys , and get over there . They 'll need help , ' We had to run all the way and when we got to the place where the smoke wus boiling up the sight made us both sick . It was just at the rim of the canyon and pieces of plane were scattered all over . We saw five or six bodies thrown out of the plane I guess . One of them looked like a child . " There was no snow on the ground and the weather was clear . The flames had been burning over half a mile and there were charred mounds that might have been other bodies . There was melted metal all around . The CAA boys from the airport were there when we arrived and they had everything under control . " Post Guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crew were not touched by investigators or local authorities and were left lying on the sagebrush covered hillside thru the night . Guards were posted to keep coyotes away . Coroner Hans P. Ipsen said an inquest would he held on the scene tomo ? . row before the bodies are moved . None of the bodies was identified at dusk . The body of one of the stewardesses  --  identified because of the uniform  --  was found in the bottom of the canyon 400 feet east of the wreck . Hours after the crash a suitcase obviously from the air liner was picked up near a highway nine miles south of the airfield . This bit John L. Nelson , 1811 N. Nagle ay. , and Miss Edith Blair , former Chicagoan and recently of Hollywood , who died in crash . of evidence supported Simpson 's report that he had seen objects falling from the aircraft as it passed over Tropic  --  and also indicated that the baggage compartment fire had broken thru the outer skin of the fuselage . New Type of Plane The DC-6 is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been delivered to American and foreign air lines , and one of this number has gone to the army for use of President Truman . Weight of the craft is 81,000 pounds , its wings span 117.5 feet and the round cabin is 100 feet long . There are seats for 50 passengers in dual compartments divided by a galley in United 's airplane . Un Chicago J. A. Herlihy , vice president of operations at the United Air Lines Chicago headquarters , said the ** were tested for more than 6,000 hours before the company took delivery of them last April and since that time they have logged more than .7,500,000 passenger miles in scheduled service . Thirty-five have been turned over to United and used on prize domestic runs and the company 's overseas flight from California to Hawaii . With their four 2,100 horse power radial engines they cruise at 300.315 miles an hour , carry more than 2,500 gallons of fuel at take-off , and consume almost 100 gallons of gasoline for each engine each hour . There is no vital mechanism within the belly baggage compartments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said today . Control lines and electric wiring are in these compartments , and electric bulbs furnish light for baggage loaders to place gear when the craft is on the ground . Theories on Crash Several theories regarding the possible causes of the fire in the after compartment have been advanced . One is that a short-circuit in the wiring may have set baggage aflame . Another is that some inflammable chemicals might have been shipped by a passenger and spontaneously became ignited in flight . Arthur Kapitanoff , Los Angeles , and June North , Philadelphia , also among the victims . In Chicago , W. A. Patterson , president of the air line , said : " It will take many days and meaty experts in all fields to study this accident . Meanwhile we can make no assumptions . When we do have a statement , we want it to be factual , supported by these experts . We do know that Capt . did all possible to save this plane and gave us the clew that the ilre was in the baggage compartment , ' enabling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vice president in charge of engineering for United , said that positive placement of the fire in the baggage compartment was possible thru the fire warning and smoke warning indicators in the cockpit . The smoke from the baggage cdmpartment would filter into the cabin even tho the plane was flying higft and fast because both the passengers and cargo cornpartments are within the pressure envelope . No Access to Hold The visual indicators in the pilot 's cockpit , he said , showed exactly where the heat and smoke were originating . Minser said that the extinguishing system on the - air plane was very complete and that filling the compartment with a nonInflammable gas should have smothered the fire . He said he was certain that the pilots had used the extinguishing system which was controied by a button from their cockpit . No other means for fighting a baggage fire was possible , it was indicated , because there is no hatch leading from the cabin to the compartment . United engineers said that the big plane , only two hours out of Los Angeles on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still heavily loaded with fuel when it . crashed . Not more than 800 gallons could have been consumed from the 2,500 gallon capacity , leaving an estimated 1,700 gallons of fuel in the tanks at the time of the accident . No mention was made by pilots or witnesses of engine failure at any time . The Douglas company dispatched from Los Angeles last evening a team of experts to assist in determining causes of the accident . Among them were Chief Engineer E. F. But-ton of the Santa Monica , Cal. , plant ; J. A. Farm service manager , and Donald Douglas Jr. , in charge of flight testing for the company .
