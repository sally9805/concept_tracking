Back from Christmas in Missouri , the President reluctantly peeled off his coat and rolled up his sleeves . The trip to Independence had been the kind of holiday he hated to cut short . <P> From the moment , the Sacred Cow landed on Kansas City 's Fairfax Airport , the atmosphere had been warm with easy-going friendliness . Nothing tickled the President more than the greeting of one overalled crony : " You look fine . You 're just the old farmer boy like you always was . " <P> As the presidential motorcade whisked east to Independence , 22 miles away , Harry Truman had only one worry . He was afraid the turkey might have got cold . It had n't . Piping hot , the bird was a plump 25-pounder , the gift of West Point Cadet Jack Capps , of Liberty , Mo. , a grateful Truman appointee who had also supplied the President last year . <P> For once the President could let himself go at mealtime . His mother had driven over from Grandview for dinner at the Truman house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second meal at her house . A third dinner he had faced last year turned out this time to be just a snack , with his aunt , Mrs. John T. Noland . <P> The Coffee Club . Next morning the President engineered one of the little scenes that most delight him . Dropping into the five- &-dime; store , in search of Mayor Roger T. Sermon , Harry Truman happily joined the " coffee club " at the soda fountain . Perched on a stool , sipping a nickel Coke , enjoying the giggling confusion of the fountain girl , Harry Truman had the time of his life . <P> But that evening , as the Sacred Cow bounced through dirty weather over West Virginia to a landing at the National Airport , the President braced himself for a sterner audience : the G.O.P.-controlled Soth Congress . <P> Hard-working Special Counsel Clark Clifford had stuck to his desk over the holidays , hammering together the President 's annual message on the state of the Union . But it needed a final polishing before it could be taken up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a budget message to deliver on the 8th , his recommendations to accompany the Economic Council 's report ( TIME , Dec. 30 ) to be given two days later . <P> Conscientious as he was , Harry Truman could whip up little enthusiasm over the prospect of his three-ply job . Last year , with a Democratic majority in Congress , his efforts had produced few results . With the G.O.P. in the driver 's seat he could expect to be even less effective in guiding the Congress . About the best course he could set lay along the line of middle-of-the-road generalities which would commit the Democratic Executive as lightly as possible .
