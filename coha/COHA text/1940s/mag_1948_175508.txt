The Democratic Party was in desperate straits . Until a few months ago , it had been living on smiles and hope . Now its very life was threatened . Unlike the Republican Party , it had at least known who its 1948 presidential candidate would be . Even though nobody was quite sure whether Harry Truman would win or lose , it was unthinkable that the Democrats should not nominate him . <P> But last week a kind of panic swept through the Democratic ranks . Suddenly Democrats everywhere began to realize that Harry Truman looked like a sure loser in November . The Southern revolt was beginning to look like a rebellion . Even the most liberal of Southern Democrats could no longer buck the bitterness engendered in the South by the President 's civil-rights program . Cried Senator Lister Hill of Alabama : " There can not be Democratic Party unity with President Truman as our nominee . " Senator Claude Pepper of Florida , no man to quail before Southern bigots , declared that the South should send unpledged delegates to the party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and West . Labor leaders , anti-Wallace liberals and machine bosses broke out with anti-Truman fever . The fever , partly induced by disgruntlement over the Administration 's blundering on Palestine , was especially virulent in such pivotal states as New York , Illinois and California . In these states even the best of local Democratic candidates had small hope of winning on a ticket topped by Harry Truman 's name . <P> A Man Who . But what other name could good Democrats plump for ? They did not forget the ancient political axiom : you ca n't beat somebody with nobody . Before they ditched Truman , they had to get a new band wagon rolling . And that was a risky business . Chicago 's canny little Jake Arvey was the first front-ranker willing to take the risk . " Come convention time , " announced Boss Arvey , " I will vote for ... a man who can be elected . I hope General Eisenhower becomes available . " <P> From all directions , a Democratic clamor went up for Ike . Nobody knew exactly what Eisenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Palestine . Nobody much cared . Those who now backed him thought that Ike , if he wanted to , could win the presidency in a breeze-for either party . To the disintegrated Democrats , it looked as if he might provide the leadership and the magic touch which Franklin Roosevelt had once given the party . <P> Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. , with a hand from his brother Elliott , gave the Eisenhower band wagon a family push . Said young Franklin : " The most serious concern of the people of the U.S. is to elect as President ... a man who will not only have a united party behind him , but also will be capable of securing the unity of our country . . . . The American people have a right to call the General back into active public service . " <P> In to Stay . Americans for Democratic Action , of which Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr . is national vice chairman , promptly announced that its executive board would meet in Pittsburgh on April 10 to endorse a man who can " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.F.L. and C.I.O. bigwigs put forth the word that they would soon come out swinging for Ike . <P> Meantime , Harry Truman calmly announced that he was in the race to stay . <P>
