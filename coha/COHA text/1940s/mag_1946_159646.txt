Peru-born Alberto Vargas , slight , black-mustached creator of Esquire 's pin-up girls , claims that he signed his without reading it . He further claims that his trusted employer said , " This is one contract you can sign with your eyes closed . " <P> According to Artist Vargas , he thought the deal was $18,000 annually for 26 Varga girls a year . The contract actually called for one Varga girl a week for ten years , at $12,000 a year . That was a " physical impossibility , " said Vargas-the girls must first be born in the mind , " then they have to come from my heart and out through my hand . " <P> In Chicago 's Federal Court last week , moist-eyed Alberto Vargas asked a judge to set aside his unwitting agreement with Esquire 's president , David Smart , and claimed $250,000 in damages , $200,000 of it for Esquire 's use of an unsigned Varga girl . Vargas also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave " Smart , he said , had urged him to live in a style that would " exude success . <P> . You should live nobly . You and your wife should both have cars . . . .
