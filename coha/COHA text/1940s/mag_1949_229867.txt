Pepsi-Cola had not been hitting the spot . Earnings had slipped , the last quarterly dividend had been omitted , and within a year Pepsi 's stock on the New York Stock Exchange had skidded from 24 ? to as low as 7 a share . Pepsi 's President Walter S. Mack Jr . thought it time to hire halls in New York and Chicago and tell stockholders the score . <P> For the 300 stockholders who gathered in Manhattan 's Town Hall last week , President Mack had some more bad news . Pepsi 's 1948 net had dropped to $3,152,817 ( from $6,769,834 in 1947 ) , and its first-quarter sales for 1949 were below those of the same period in 1948 . Nevertheless , Mack was sure the worst of the company 's postwar readjustment would be over in another six months . <P> Bottles &; Bonuses . Pepsi has cut costs ( minor item : its annual art awards have been abandoned ) , and the company has a new eight-ounce bottle to sell for 5 at race tracks and ball parks . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( new price : 6 ) . Pepsi also has a new syrup pump for drugstores ; at the first plunge , it plays the Pepsi jingle . To cash in on these new ideas , Mack has brought Coca-Cola Vice President Al Steele into the company as sales boss . <P> Now , asked President Mack , did anybody have any questions ? One stockholder , who had not been wasting his time on soft drinks , staggered down the center aisle and peered blearily at Mack . Why , he demanded , had executive bonuses been maintained while the dividend had been passed ? Said Mack : bonuses had been scaled down according to the earnings ( in 1948 , Mack got $20,000 on top of his $104,000 salary ) . Anyway , he added , good executives " do n't come a dime a dozen . " <P> " Where 's Steele ? " asked the stockholder , looking over the executives seated on the stage . " Oh , there y'are , Steele . Glad t'see ya , ole boy . G'luck . " <P> Shots &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Why not put vending machines in high-school cafeterias ? Mack said he would try . Why had Pepsi 's simple offices in Long Island City been sold , and expensive , midtown Manhattan offices rented instead ? Said Mack : renting was cheaper and , anyhow , should n't executives have dignified offices ? The stockholders applauded . <P> One more shot was taken at Mack 's salary . Did he think he was worth more than the President of the U.S. Said Mack smoothly : " I do n't put myself in a class with Mr. Truman . " <P> Finally , everyone had another round of Pepsi , and the pepped-up stockholders went home . Stock-market traders had joined the party for a little whirl ; this week , Pepsi rose to $12 a share .
