Quoting the Department of Agriculture 's own figures published as recently as March of this year : " Production of shorn wool for 1946 is now Placed at 280 million pounds . This is 9 per cent . below the 1945 production and is 28 per cent below the revised estimate of 388 million pounds for 1942 , when production was at a record high . " In other words , instead of the Govarrunent buying program increasing ? domestic wool production , it has gone , off steadily since the program was in- augurated in 1942 . And it is generally estimated that production in 1947 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , as with so many of our wild Government schemes , the plan has had exactly the opposite effect of that intended . And in spite of our lowered production , the Government now owns a stockpile of something like 450 million pounds of wool , which it can not sell at current prices .
