To a sensitive nerve end in U.S.-Asiatic relations-the absence of American diplomats whose prestige matches the importance of Asia in the 1942 world-Franklin Roosevelt applied some balm last week . To serve as his " personal representative " in India he appointed suave , gracious William Phillips , a top-flight career diplomat who has held many an important post since he left Harvard Law School for the State Department in 1903 . <P> William Phillips , whose family has been distinguished in New England since the founding of Massachusetts Bay Colony , has no State Department rival save Under Secretary Sumner Welles for tall , aristocratic elegance . He was once Assistant Secretary of State , twice Under Secretary , served as Ambassador to Belgium and Italy , has been one of State Secretary Cordell Hull 's croquet-playing cronies . <P> But Ambassador Phillips ' new mission* does not mean that the U.S. intends to abandon its hands-off policy in the bitter struggle over India 's political status . At 64 , Ambassador Phillips is a patient , conservative diplomat who has never ruffled feathers nor interfered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin Roosevelt said plainly : his representative carries no plans and no formulas . <P> * Despite the " personal " nature of his new post , Mr. Phillips will hold the rank of Ambassador in deference to his standing in the State Department .
