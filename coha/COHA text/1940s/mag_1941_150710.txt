Biggest danger in the idea of a separate air force , according to ground-gripping Army men , is that an autonomous air arm would go its own sweet way , leave the rest of the Army up in the air . Last week The Army Air Forces , closer to independence than the air arm ever was before , tried to calm such fears . It announced the organization of five Air Support Commands , designed specifically to back up ground forces with everything from reconnaissance to bombing support . <P> Planned for months , the Support Commands clearly showed Air Forces ' recognition of its dual function : 1 ) operation as a separate striking force ; 2 ) operation with the land forces as aerial cavalry ( reconnaissance ) , infantry ( machine-gun attack ) and artillery ( bombing ) . <P> For overall operation ( and with a view to independent action ) , the air arm is divided into Air Forces , four for the continental U.S. , three others for the Caribbean , Hawaii and the Philippines . Included in each Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus bombers and reconnaissance organizations . The new Air Support Commands will be part of the four Air Forces in the continental U.S. , whose areas are laid out to cover the same areas as the four field armies . <P> The Air Support Commands will work , in maneuvers or in battle , under the direction of ground commanders . One of the <P> Commands will be attached to each of the four field armies when they take the field ; the fifth will be attached to the Armored Force . To do a job of cooperation comparable with the German Luftwaffe 's , they have a lot of give- &-take; education ahead of them .
