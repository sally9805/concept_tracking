Malaria is not ordinarily much of a killer , but in Upper Egypt last week it was as lethal as the plague . Accepted estimate was that in two years it has caused about 86,000 deaths in Qena and Aswan provinces ( pop . about 1,000,000 ) , some 400 miles from Cairo . Other estimates run as high as 200,000 . Whole villages have been wiped out and , as in plague times , bodies lie unburied in the streets . Only in India and China , where malaria 's pernicious forms are common , are such epidemics prevalent . <P> Many Egyptians blame the epidemic on the British , claim the British brought Anopheles gambiae , the most dreaded malaria-carrying mosquito , to the area via Nubia from the Sudan . They also blame the British for buying up Egypt 's food , causing undernourishment which makes the fellahin highly susceptible to disease . Actually , the British buy no corn at all from Egypt , buy no wheat without permission from the Government . Real reason the fellahin are starving : they get only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from landlords who run the region on the feudal system . Now even the landlords are worried , for malaria has so weakened the workers that ten are now needed to do the work of one and the production of sugar may soon go down . <P> The malaria situation became a political issue last fortnight when Egyptian Government delegates in the Chamber of Deputies tried to smother bitter complaints by claiming that malaria has caused only 13,000 deaths . But even King Farouk knew better-he had visited the stricken land . <P> Also alarming is the prospect that Anopheles gambiae may continue its progress north and breed in the myriad ponds and pools of northern Egypt , causing a disastrous epidemic which would hinder the war effort in Cairo .
