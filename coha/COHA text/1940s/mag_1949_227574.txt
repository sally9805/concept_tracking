When the new French envoy arrived in Venice in 1494 he was given a grand tour of the city . Bug-eyed at Venice 's multicolored palaces , its works of art and its citizens ' lavish hospitality , he proclaimed it " the most triumphant city I have ever seen . " <P> At the end of the 15th Century , Venice still drew on a great and profitable commerce with the East . Riding the crest of the Renaissance , industrious Venetian artists were turning out more paintings than the artists of any other city in Europe . <P> Last week 20th Century Venice was a dingy shadow of such glories . But in 16 rooms of the vast Palace of the Doges , now an art museum , Venetians and tourists could get a glimpse of Venice at its noontime brightest . <P> For eight months the city fathers had been rounding up the works of Giovanni Bellini , long-acknowledged master of 15th Century Venetian art , who once had bishops and nobles competing for his magnificent altarpieces and light-filled portraits , and whose works are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 142 of his 180 extant paintings and drawings , collected from all over Europe and the U.S. , this is the largest Bellini show ever held .

In his Piet with St. John , which shows Mary supporting the body of Jesus while the dazed John stares into the distance , Bellini brought the tightlipped , hot-house Byzantine virgins of earlier Venetian painting out into the clear sunlight of the Italian countryside . <P> His portraits of well-fed merchant princes and other secular heroes , like the shrewd-eyed , poker-straight Doge Leonardo Loredano , resplendent in gold brocade and carved buttons , registered the pride and self-possession of the Renaissance itself . The work of Bellini 's last years , in such paintings as the Toilet of Venus and Feast of the Gods , anticipated the frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his two greatest pupils , Giorgione and Titian . <P> Unlike restless Leonardo da Vinci , who died a lonely old man far from his native Italy in France , Bellini stuck close to home all his 86 years , was finally buried in the church of SS . Giovanni e Paolo , which as a young man he had helped to decorate . His only recorded complaint against the city that made him wealthy and world famous : its magistrates ' insistence that he continue to pay his union dues to the local painters ' guild .
