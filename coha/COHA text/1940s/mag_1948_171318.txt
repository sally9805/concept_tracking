At North Bay , Ont. , two Canadian Communists clambered aboard a train on which Mike Moskal , 22 , a Ukrainian D.P. , was riding to a new job in a northern Ontario gold mine . They told him some very unkind things about Canada , handed him propaganda leaflets , tried to talk him into giving up , going back to Russia . The same thing happened , on the same trip , to Joe Trhlen , John Sanajko , Myroslaw Blauk , 50-odd other D.P.s . Said Mike Moskal : " Was no good . Did n't like . " <P> When the story first came out , in mid-December , Canadians considered it an isolated incident . But last week they were beginning to wonder . In Winnipeg , " Mother City " of the Dominion 's 350,000 Ukrainians , a man who ought to know charged that what had happened to Mike Moskal and his friends had happened to most , if not all , of the 6,700 odd D.P.s entering Canada since April 1947 . <P> The man who made the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada . Specially trained Canadian Communists , said he , have been posted in key Canadian centers under orders from Moscow to " confuse and discourage " incoming D.P.s . They work in teams , he said . Some Communists meet incoming D.P.s on the piers at eastern ports . Others contact them on their trains as they head for their new homes . The Communists constantly harass the immigrants , said Bishop Ladyka , and try to bribe them to return to Europe . They tell the immigrants " that they have been ' exported ' here for slave labor . " They offer to " produce the ' ransom ' to ' rescue ' the D.P.s if they will join the ranks of the Reds . " Even when the immigrants reach their new homes in Canada , said Bishop Ladyka , the " Communist plea " continues by mailed pamphlets which warn the immigrants that Canada is controlled by " fascists and capitalists , " and to return to Europe " before it is too late . " <P> The Bishop announced a counteroffensive . The Ukrainian Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada as it really is.
