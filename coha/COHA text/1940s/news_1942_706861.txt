txt Speed Limits Ignored A friend who has had daily occasion to observe the traffic on the Boston Post Road tells me that with no exceptions automobilists have displayed a distressing lack of patriotism by completely ignoring the speed regulation and racing their cars at forty to seventy miles an hour . Here in the city , too , there has been a minimum observance by automobilists and taxicab drivers of either rubber conservation or safety precaution on dimmed-out streets and avenues . Since the rubber emergency is a national one and affects the nation 's prosecution of the war , may I suggest that the rules and regulations governing speed should be set by the government , and violations thereof be prosecuted as Federal offenses . The public by this time has learned that Uncle Sam means what he says and enforces without discrimination . IRVING CAESAR . New York , Dec. 2 , 1942.
