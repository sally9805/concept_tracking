Only three times in 20 years has mild-mannered Sampson Cluse , Labor M.P . for South Islington , emerged from Parliament 's back-bench obscurity and made a speech . His first was the maiden speech which tradition demands of all M.P.s . His second was when he protested against the means test for those on the dole . Last week Cluse spoke again . <P> There was no oratory in the few simple words he said . There was no need for it . Parliament had just heard Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden read a joint declaration by the U.S. , Britain and nine other nations deploring and protesting the " bestial policy of cold-blooded extermination " of the millions of Jews trapped behind the walls of Hitler 's Europe . Eden had said : " Members can be sure that we will do whatever we can to alleviate these horrors , but at this stage it must inevitably be slight . " <P> As the 200 M.P.s sat silent and ill at ease because there was nothing more to be said , Sampson Cluse rose and cleared his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the Speaker whether all members should not rise and pay silent testimony to their horror and their determination to defeat Hitler . The Speaker ruled that the suggestion was unprecedented but that the members could rise voluntarily . <P> " They all got up , " said Sampson Cluse later . " In a moment or two everyone was standing . It was a great thing . They all came and shook me by the hand afterward. "
