" Ladies and gentlemen , " the announcer said , " the Dutch national anthem ! " At the Millrose Games in Madison Square Garden , 16,000 track fans rose respectfully while the band tootled an unfamiliar tune in honor of The Netherlands ' miler , stringy Willy Slykhuis ( rhymes , roughly , with dike mouse ) . * Then the band played the Swedish national anthem , for Miler Ingvar Bengtsson , and a baritone sang The Star-Spangled Banner . The crowd sat back to wait for Slykhuis and Bengtsson . No foreigner had ever won the Wanamaker Mile , but now that the mighty Gil Dodds had retired , the invaders seemed to have a fine chance to break the pattern . <P> The only real U.S. hope in the six-man field was a young ( 21 ) , skinny and bespectacled University of Wisconsin junior named Don Gehrmann , making his bigtime indoor debut . For weeks , track circles had buzzed with rumors about Gehrmann 's sensational time trials in Madison : his coaches claimed to have clocked him in 4:06.1 , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was not a mistake , Gehrmann could be the best miler on the boards . <P> Something Blue . Ever since he ran the mile for Milwaukee 's Pulaski High , Don Gehrmann had preferred to hang back with the pack , then knock off the leader with a terrific sprint in the stretch . But this year Guy Sundt , Wisconsin 's track coach , had taught him to run a different kind of race . With supreme confidence , Gehrmann was planning to ignore Slykhuis and Bengtsson . He would run against the clock , not the competition : a fast 58-second first quarter , a 2-minute half , a 3:04 three quarters , and a record-breaking 4:05 finish . The race called for circling the Garden 's banked board track eleven times . <P> The gun caught Gehrmann just getting down to his mark . He had to pour it on to catch up , but at the quarter the red Wisconsin jersey was out in front-in 59.5 . Track veterans , remembering Gil Dodds 's windmill style , were struck by the contrast ; like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . He was all legs , eating up the boards with a long ( 8 ft. ) , smooth and relaxed stride . Crumpled in his right hand , Gehrmann clutched something blue-a handkerchief , for luck . <P> Something Wrong . Gehrmann wasted no time looking back . The loudspeaker told him what he wanted to know : at the half , he heard his time ( 2:02 ) , noted that Willy Slykhuis was second , pressing close . Ingvar Bengtsson , loaded with penicillin for abscessed teeth , had faded fast and was out of the running . <P> At the eighth lap , the Dutchman seized the lead . Then something really went wrong with the calculations of Wisconsin 's Gehrmann ; his time at the three-quarters mark , with Willy still out in front , was 3:08 , four seconds more than he had planned . Said Gehrmann later : " I knew then that I could n't beat 4:05.3 . I figured I might as well take it easy , and beat him in the stretch . " <P> Gehrmann did . Entering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sprinter , passed Slykhuis with 5 yards to go , broke the tape a foot in front . Time : 4:09.5 . Said Gehrmann after he had caught his breath : " I 'm sorry my time was n't better . My pacing was a little off tonight . "
