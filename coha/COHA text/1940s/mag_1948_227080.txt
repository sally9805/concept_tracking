Republicans , who thought they were in the know before Nov. 2 , had a variety of explanations for what hit them . Most of them seemed to add up to the fact that they , themselves , were to blame . <P> Governor Thomas E. Dewey ( at Albany ) : " I was quite surprised by the very low vote . It looks as though two or three million Republicans stayed home , out of overconfidence . That one fact stands out from the returns so far . " <P> Speaker Joseph W. Martin Jr. : " The Republican Party digressed too far from the people . We offered them too many Brahmins : too many plutocrats . I have nothing against plutocrats , except too many of them have got into the party . " <P> New York 's Senator Irving M. Ives : " The defeat of the Republicans can be ascribed to . . . the inability of the 80th Congress to get together on a forward-looking , liberal program ... We are moving forward in this country . We are not static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . that political party is not going to get very far . " <P> Senator George D. Aiken : " The Old Guard is a self-perpetuating board of trustees who would rather see the party go down to defeat than give up control of the machinery ... I had hoped that Dewey would get in and be able to renovate the party . But now we 'll have to do our own housecleaning if we are ever to elect a Republican President . " <P> Senator Robert A. Taft : " It is almost impossible to put an administration out of office at the very peak of a boom . " <P> Dewey Campaign Strategist Ed Jaeckle : " It was obvious all along that Dewey was carrying a lot of excess baggage-excess baggage like Taft , " Curly " Brooks , Ball , Robertson , and the rest of them . The voters ... apparently figured Dewey would have a hell of a time with those people and that this was the time to clean them all out . . . " <P> Congressman Fred Hartley Jr. , coauthor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President of the United States too soon . "
