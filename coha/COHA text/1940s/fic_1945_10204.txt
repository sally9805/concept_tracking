guffawed . " There you are , Eugenie . Do n't answer ! You 'll get in even deeper ! " " My dignity as a woman ? " " Fine ! " Veber interrupted . " Stick to that . That 's always good . I 've got to leave now . I 've still some things to do in the office . Come , Ravic . Good morning , Eugenie . " " Good morning , Doctor Veber . " " Good morning , Nurse Eugenie , " Ravic said . " Good morning , " Eugenie replied with an effort and only after Veber had turned around to look at her . Veber 's office was crowded with Empire furniture ; white and gold and fragile . Photographs of his house and garden hung on the wall above his desk . A modern broad chaise longue stood against the wall . Veber slept on it when he stayed overnight . The private hospital belonged to him . " What would you like to drink , Ravic ? Cognac or Dubonnet ? " " Coffee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Veber placed the coffeepot on the desk and put the plug in . Then he turned to Ravic . " Can you substitute for me in the Osiris this afternoon ? " " Of course . " " You do n't mind ? " " Not in the least . I 've no other plans . " " Fine . Then I wo n't have to drive in again just to go there . I can work in my garden . I 'd have asked Fauchon but he is on his vacation . " " Nonsense , " Ravic said . " I 've clone it often enough . " " That 's right . Nevertheless ? " " Nevertheless no longer exists nowadays . Not for me . " " Yes . It 's idiotic enough that you are not permitted to work here officially and have to hide out as a ghost surgeon . " " But Veber ! That 's an old story now . It is happening to all physicianswho fled from Germany . " " Just the same ! It 's ridiculous ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself . " " Better than if he did them himself . " T n r U M P HVeber laughed . " I 'm a fine one to talk . You do mine too . But after all , I am a gynecologist and not a specialist in surgery . " The coffeepot began to hum . Veber turned it off . He took cups out of a closet and poured the coffee . " One thing I really do n't understand , Ravic , " he said . " Why do you go on living in that depressing hole , the International ? Why do n't you rent one of those nice new apartments in the neighborhood of the Bois ? You could buy some furniture anywhere cheap . Then at least you 'd know what 's your own ! " " Yes , " Ravic said . " Then I would know what was my own ! " " See ! Why do n't you do it ? " Ravic took a gulp of his coffee . It was bitter and very strong . " Veber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the convenientthinking of our time . In one breath you are sorry because I work illegally her  --  nd at the same time you ask me why I do n't rent a nice apartment ? " " What 's one got to do with the other ? " Ravic smiled patiently . " If I take an apartment I must be registeredwith the police . I would need a passport and a visa for that . " " That 's right . I had n't thought of that . And in hotels you do n't need any ? " " There too . But , thank God , there are a few hotels in Paris that do n't take registration too seriously . " Ravic poured a few drops of cognac into his coffee . " One of them is the International . That 's why I live there . I do n't know how the landlady arranges it . But she must have good connections . Either the police really do n't know about it or they are bribed . At any rate I have lived there for quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ravic ! " he said .

If they do come some day ? " " If they catch us we get a few weeks ' imprisonment and are deportedacross the border . Mostly into Switzerland . In case of a second offense we get six months in prison . " " What ? " A R C H O F " Six months , " Ravic said . Veber stared at him . " But that 's impossible ! That 's inhuman ! " " That 's what I thought , too . Until I experienced it . " " How do you mean experienced ? Has that ever happened to you ? " " Not once . Three times . Just as to hundreds of others as well .

From German and Italian fliers . Then later when I returned to France I , of course , knew the ins and outs of it . " Veber got up . " But for heaven 's sake " ? he figured it out ? " then you have been imprisoned over a year for nothing . " " Not as long as that . Only two months . " " How is that ? Did n't you say in the case of a second offense it was six months ? " Ravic smiled . " There are no second offenses when one is experienced . One is deported under one name and simply returns under another . If possible , at another point on the frontier . That 's how we avoid it . Since we have no papers it can only be proven if someone recognizes us personally . That very rarely happens . Ravic is my third name . I 've used it for almost two years . Nothing has happened in that time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to like it more every day . By now I 've almost forgotten my real name . " Veber shook his head . " And all this simply because you are not a Nazi ! " " Naturally . Nazis have first-class papers . And all the visas they want . " " Nice world we live in ! And the government does n't do a thing ! " " There are several million men out of work for whom the government has to care first . Besides it 's not only in France . The same thing is happening everywhere . " Ravic got up . " Adieu , Veber . I 'll look in on the girl again in two hours . And once more at night . " Veber followed him to the door . " Listen , Ravic , " he said . " Why do n't you come out to our house sometime ? For dinner . " T R I U M P H " Certainly . " Ravic knew he would not go . " Sometime soon . Adieu , Veber . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ravic went into the nearest bistro . He sat by a window so that he could look out upon the street . He loved tha  --  o sit without thinking and watch the people passing by . Paris was the city where one could best spend one 's time doing nothing . The waiter wiped the table and waited . " A Pernod , " Ravic said . " With water , sir ? " " No . " Ravic deliberated . " Do n't bring me a Pernod . " There was something he had to wash away . A bitter taste . For that the sweet anise was n't sharp enough . " Bring me a calvados , " he said to the waiter . " A double calvados . " " Very well , sir . " It was Veber 's invitation . That tinge of pity in it . To grant someonean evening with a family . The French rarely invite foreigners to their homes ; they prefer to take them to restaurants . He had not yet been to Veber 's . It was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against insults ; not against pity . He took a gulp of the apple brandy . Why did he have to explain to Veber his reasons for living in the International ? It was n't necessary . Veber had known all he need know . He knew that Ravic was not permitted to operate . That was enough . That he worked with him nevertheless , was his affair . In this way he made money and.could arrange for operations he did not dare perform himself . No one knew about i  --  nly he and the nurs  --  nd she kept quiet . It was the same with Durant . Whenever he had an operation to perform he stayed with the patient until he went under the anesthetic . Then Ravic came and performed the operation for which Durant was too old and incompetent . When the patient awoke later on , there was Durant , the proud surgeon , at his bedside . Ravic saw only the covered patient ; he knew only the narrow iodine-stained area of the body bared for the operation . He very often did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diagnosis and he began to cut . Durant paid Ravic about onetenthof what he received for an operation . Ravie did n't mind . It42 43A R C H 0 Fwas better than not operating at all . With Veber he worked on a more friendly basis . Veber paid him a quarter of the proceeds . That was fair . Ravic looked through the window . And what besides ? There was n't much else left . But he was alive , that was enough . At a time when everything was tottering he had no wish to build up something that was bound shortly to fall into ruins . It was better to drift than to waste energy ; that was the one thing that was irreplaceable . To survive meant everythin  --  ntil somewhere a goal again became visible . The less energy that took , the better ; then one would have it afterwards . The antlike attempt to build up a bourgeois life again and again in a century that was falling to piece  --  e had seen that ruin many . It was touching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless . It made one weary . An avalanche could n't be stopped once it had started to move ; whoever tried , fell beneath it . Better to wait and later to dig out the victims . On long marches one had to travel light . Also when one was fleeingRavic looked at his watch . It was time to look at Lucienne Martinet . And then go to the Osiris . The whores in the Osiris were waiting . Although they were examined regularly by an official physician , the madame was not content with that . She could not afford to have anyone contract a disease in her place ; for that reason she had made an arrangement with Veber to have the girls privately re-examined each Thursday . Sometimes Ravic substituted for him . The madame had furnished and equipped a place on the first floor as an examination room . She was proud of the fact that for more than a year none of her customers had caught anything in her establishment ; but in spite of all the girls ' precautions seventeen cases of venereal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gouvernante , brought Ravic a bottle of brandy and a glass . " I think Marthe has got something , " she said . " All right . I 'll examine her carefully . " " I have n't let her work since yesterday . Naturally , she denies it . " " All right , Rolande. " 441 ' R I U M P HThe girls came in in their slips , one after the other . Ravic knew almost all of them ; only two were new . " You do n't have to examine me , doctor , said Leonie , a redhairedGascon . " Why not ? " " No clients the whole week . " " What does madame say to that ? " " Nothing . I made them order a lot of champagne . Seven , eight bottles a night . Three businessmen from Toulouse . Married . All three of them would have liked to , but none of them dared becauseof the others . Each was afraid if he came with me the others would talk about it at home . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others . " Leonie laughed and scratched herself lazily . " The one who did n't pass out was n't able to stand up . " " All right . Nevertheless , I 've got to examine you . " " It 's all right with me . Have you a cigarette , doctor ? " " Yes , here . " Ravic took a swab and colored it . Then he pushed the glass slide under the microscope . " You know what I do n't understand ? " Leonie said , watching him . " What ? " " That you still feel like sleeping with a woman when you do these things . " " I do n't understand it either . You 're all right . Now who 's next ? " " Marthe . " Marthe was pale , slender , and blond . She had the face of a Botticelli angel , but she spoke the argot of the Rue Blondel . " There is nothing wrong with me , doctor . " " That 's fine . Let 's have a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " All the better . " Suddenly Rolande was standing in the room . She looked at Marthe . The girl stopped talking . She looked at Ravic apprehensively . He examined her thoroughly . " But it is nothing , doctor . You know how careful I am. " 45A R C H O FRavic did not reply . The girl continued to tal  --  esitated and began again . Ravic swabbed a second time and examined it . " You are sick , Marthe , " he said . " What ? " She jumped up . " That ca n't be true . " " It is true . " She looked at him . Then she broke out suddenl  --  flood of curses and maledictions . " That swine ! That damned swine ! I did n't trust him anyway , the slippery trickster ! He said he was a student and he ought to know , a medical student , that scoundrel ! " " Why did n't you take care ? " " I did , but it went so quickly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ravic nodded . The old stor  --  medical student who had treated himself . After two weeks he had considered himself cured without making a test . " How long will it take , doctor ? " " Six weeks . " Ravic knew it would take longer . " Six weeks ? Six weeks without any income ? Hospital ? Do I have to go to the hospital ? " " We 'll see about that . Maybe we can treat you at home late  --  f you promise ? " " I 'll promise anything ! Anything ! Only not the hospital ! " " You 've got to go at first . There 's no other way . " The girl stared at Ravic . All prostitutes feared the hospital . The supervision was very strict there . But there was nothing else to do . Left at home she would furtively go out after a few days , in spite of all promises , and look for men in order to make money and infect them . " The madame will pay the expenses , " Ravic said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any income ! And I have just bought a silver fox on installments ! Then the installment will be due and everything will be gone . " She cried . " Come , Marthe , " Rolande said . " You wo n't take me back ! I know ! " Marthe sobbed louder . " You wo n't take me back ! You never do it ! Then I 'll be on the streets . And all because of that slippery dog ? " " We 'll take you back . You were good business . Our clients like you . " 46T It I U M P H " Really ? " Marthe looked up . " Of course . And now come . " Marthe left with Rolande . Ravic looked after her . Marthe would not come back . Madame was much too careful . Her next stage was perhaps the cheap brothels in the Rue Blondel . Then the street . Then cocaine , the hospital , peddling flowers or cigarettes . Or , if she were lucky , some pimp who would beat and exploit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hotel International was in the basement . The lodgers called it the Catacombs . During the day a dim light came through several large , thick , opalescent-glass panes which faced on the courtyard . In the winter it had to be lighted all day long . The room was at once a writing room , a smoking room , an auditorium , an assembly room , and a refuge for those emigrantswho had no paper  --  hen there was a police inspection they could escape through the yard into a garage and from there to the next street . Ravic sat with the doorman of the Scheherazade night club , Boris Morosow , in a section of the Catacombs that the landlady called the Palm Room ; on a spindly legged table a solitary miserablepalm languished there in a majolica pot . Morosow was a refugee from the first war and had lived in Paris for the last fifteen years . He was one of the few Russians who did not claim to have served in the Czar 's Guard and who did not speak of his aristocratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catacombs were empty except for one table at which a few people were sitting and drinking and talking in loud voices , breaking into a toast every few minutes . Morosow looked around angrily . " Can you explain to me , Ravic , why there is such a rumpus here tonight ? Why do n't these refugees go to bed ? " Ravic smiled . " The refugees in that corner do n't concern me , Boris . That is the Fascist section of the hotel . Spain . " " Spain ? Were n't you there , too ? " " Yes , but on the other side . Moreover as a doctor . These are47A R C H 0 FSpanish monarchists with Fascist trimmings . The remnants of them . The others have gone back a long time ago . These have n't quite been able to make up their minds yet . Franco was not gentile enough for them . The Moors who butchered Spaniards naturally did not disturb them . " Morosow placed his chessmen . " Then they probably are celebratingthe massacre at Guernica . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the miners in Estremadura . Never before have I seen those fellows here . " " They have been here for years . You did n't see them because you never eat here . " " Do you eat here ? " " No . " " Morosow grinned . " All right , " he said . " Let 's skip my next questionand your answer , which certainly would be insulting . For all I care , they could have been born here in this hole . If they would only lower their voices . Her  --  he good old queen 's gambit . " Ravic moved the pawn opposite . They made the first moves quickly . Then Morosow began to brood . " There is a variant by Alekhine ? " Ravic saw that one of the Spaniards was coming over . He was a man with close-set eyes and he stopped by their table . Morosow looked at him ill-humoredly . The Spaniard did not stand quite straight . " Gentlemen , " he said politely , " Colonel Gomez requests you to drink a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morosow replied with equal politeness , " we are just playinga game of chess for the Championship of the Seventeenth Arrondissement . We express our grateful thanks , but we ca n't come . " The Spaniard did not move a muscle . He turned to Ravic formallyas if he were at the court of Philip II . " You rendered a friendly service to Colonel Gomez some time ago . He would like to have a drink with you in token of appreciation before his de-parture . " " My partner , " Ravic replied with the same formality , " has just explained to you that we must play this game today . Give my thanks to Colonel Gomez . I am very sorry . " The Spaniard bowed and went back . Morosow chuckled . " JustT R I U M P Hlike the Russians in the first years . Stuck to their titles and manners as if they were life preservers . What friendly service did you render to this Hottentot ? " " Once I prescribed a laxative for him . The Latin people have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ravic . " The old weakness of democracy . A Fascist in the same situation would have prescribed arsenic for a democrat . " The Spaniard returned . " My name is Navarro , First Lieutenant , " he declared with the heavy earnestness of a man who has drunk too much and does not know it . " I am the aide-de-camp of Colonel Gomez . The colonel is leaving Paris tonight . He is going to Spain to join the glorious army of Generalissimo Franco . That 's why he would like to drink with you to Spain 's freedom and to Spain 's army . " " Lieutenant Navarro , " Ravic said briefly , " I 'm not a Spaniard . " " We know that . You are a German . " Navarro showed the shadow of a conspiratorial smile . " That 's just the reason for Colonel Gomez ' wish . Germany and Spain are friends . " Ravic looked at Morosow . The irony of the situation was marked . Morosow kept from smiling . " Lieutenant Navarro , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Doctor Ravic . The results must be cabled to New York and Calcutta tonight . " " Sir , " Navarro replied coldly , " we expected you to decline . Russia is Spain 's enemy . The invitation was directed to Doctor Ravic only . We had to invite you too since you were with him . " Morosow placed a knight he had won on his huge flat hand and looked at Ravic . " Do n't you think there has been enough of this buffoonery ? " " Yes . " Ravic turned around . " I think the simplest thing is that you go back , young man . You have needlessly insulted Colonel Morosow , who is an enemy of the Soviets . " He bent over the chessboard without waiting for an answer . Navarro stood undecided for a moment . Then he left . " I do n't know whether you noticed that I have just promoted you to the rank of colonel , Boris , " Ravic said . " As far as I know you were a miserable lieutenant colonel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same military rank as this Gomez . " " Do n't talk so much , old boy . I 've just messed up Alekhine 's variant because of these interruptions . That bishop seems to be lost . " Morosow looked up . " My God , here comes another one . Anotheraide-de-camp . What a people ! " " It is Colonel Gomez himself . " Ravic leaned back comfortably . " This will be a discussion between two colonels . " " Short one , my son . " The colonel was even more formal than Navarro . He apologized to Morosow because of his aide-de-camp 's error . The apology was accepted . Now Gomez invited them to drink together to Franco as a sign of reconciliation since all obstacles had been removed . This time Ravic refused . " But sir , as a German and an ally ? " The colonel was obviously confused . " Colonel Gomez , " said Ravic , who was gradually becoming impatient , " leave the situation as it is . Drink to whomever you like and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " Then you are a ? " " You 'd better make no statements , " Morosow interrupted him briefly . " It would only lead to conflict . " Gomez became more and more confused . " But you as a White Russian and an officer of the Czar must be against ? " " We do n't have to be anything at all . We are old-fashioned creatures . We have different political opinions and , nevertheless , do n't break each other 's skulls . " Finally it seemed to dawn upon Gomez . He stiffened . " I see , " he declared sharply . " Decadent democratic ? " " My friend , " Morosow said , suddenly becoming dangerous , " get out ! You should have got out years ago ! To Spain . To fight . Germans and Italians fought for you there instead . Adieu . " He got up . Gomez took one step back . He stared at Morosow , disconcerted . Then he abruptly turned around and went back to his table . Morosow sat down again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bring us two double calvados , Clarisse . " Clarisse nodded and disappeared . " Stout , soldierly souls ! " Ravic50T R I U M P Hlaughed . " A simple mind and a complicated conception of honor make life very difficult when one is drunk , Boris . " " That I see ! Here comes the next one already . Who is it this time ? Franco himself ? " It was Navarro . He stopped two steps away from the table and addressed Morosow . " Colonel Gomez regrets to be unable to present his challenge . He is leaving Paris tonight . Besides , his mission is too important to risk difficulties with the police . " He turned toward Ravic . " Colonel Gomez still owes you the fee for a consultation . " He threw a folded five-franc bill on the table and was about to turn away . " One moment , " Morosow said . Clarisse was just then at his side with a tray . He took a glass of calvados , briefly contemplated it , shook his head , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water glasses from the tray and negligently tossed it in Navarro 's face . " That 's to sober you up , " he declared calmly . " Remember in the future that one does n't throw money . And now get away from here , you medieval idiot ! " Navarro stood still in astonishment . He dried his face . The other Spaniards approached . There were four of them . Morosow got up slowly . He was more than a head taller than the Spaniards . Ravic remained sitting . He looked at Gomez . " Do n't make yourself ridiculous , you comic-opera characters , " he said . " None of you is sober . Within a few minutes you 'll be lying here with broken bones . Even if you were sober you would stand no chance . " He got up , seized Navarro by the elbows , lifted him , and put him down so near to Gomez that Gomez had to step aside . " And now leave us alone . We did not ask you to annoy us . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the tray . " That 's for you , Clarisse . From these gentlemen here . " " The first time I ever got anything from them , " Clarisse declared . " Thanks . " Gomez said something in Spanish . The five turned around and went back to their table . " It 's a pity , " Morosow said . " I 'd have liked to beat up those fellows . Sorry that it ca n't be done because of you , you illegal foundling . Do n't you sometimes regret that you ca n't do it ? " 51A R C H 0 F " Not with those . There are others I 'd like to get hold of . " A few words in Spanish became audible from the table in the corner . The five rose . A threefold viva resounded . The glasses were set down clinking . There was the sound of one breaking . Then the martial group filed out of the room . " I almost threw this good calvados in his face . " Morosow took the glass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governs Europe now ! Were we too such fools once ? " " Yes , " Ravic said . They played for an hour . Then Morosow looked up . " There is Charles , " he said . " He seems to be looking for you . " The boy from the concierge 's box was coming toward them . He held a little package in his hand . " This was left for you , " he said to Ravic . " For me ? " Ravic examined the package . It was small and wrapped in white tissue paper , tied with a string . There was no address on it . " I 'm not expecting any packages . It must be a mistake . Who brought it ? " " A woma  --  lady ? " the boy stammered . " A woman or a lady ? " Morosow asked . " Jus  --  ust in between . " Morosow grinned . " Pretty sharp . " " There 's no name on it . Did she say it was for me ?

Indiscretion is only for cavaliers of the great world . " " Go ahead and open the package , Ravic , " Morosow said . " Even if it is n't for you . We 've done worse in our deplorable lives .

" What on earth shall I do with it ? " " Put it anywhere . Many things can be put just anywhere . There 's plenty of room for everything in this world . Only not for human beings . " " They will have buried the man meanwhile ? " " Is she the one ? " " Yes . " " Did you ever bother to see her again ? " " No .

But you are going to a lot of trouble for me . " " I do n't like to eat alone . That 's all there is to it . Just like you . " " I 'm not a good companion . " " You are , " Ravic replied . " For dining , you are . For dining you are a first-rate companion . I ca n't bear garrulous people . Or those with loud voices . " He looked across the room toward Albert . The red-feathered hat was just explaining to him . very audibly why he was such a swine , at the same time rhythmically rapping on the table with her umbrella . Albert was listening and did not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. " " Here comes the next wagon with supplies . Would you like to have something at once or do you want a cigarette first ? " " A cigarette first . " " All right . Today I have different cigarettes , not those with black tobacco . " He gave her a light . She leaned back and inhaled the smoke deeply . Then she looked straight at him . " It is good to sit this way , " she said and for a moment it seemed to him that she was going to cry . They drank coffee in the Colisee . The large room facing the Champs Elysees was overcrowded , but they secured a table downstairs in the bar . The upper part of the walls was glass behind which parrots and cockatoos hovered and multicolored tropical birds soared to and fro . " Have you thought about what you 're going to do ? " Ravic asked . " No , not yet . " " Did you have anything definite in mind when you came here ? " The woman hesitated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not asking out of curiosity . " " I know that . You think I should do something . That 's what I want , too . I say so to myself every day . But then ? " " The landlord told me you were an actress . I did n't ask him . He told me when I asked for your name . " " Had you forgotten it ? " 59A R C H 0 FRavic glanced up . She looked at him calmly . " Yes , " he said . " I left the slip of paper in my hotel and could n't recall it at the moment . " " Do you know it now ? " " Yes . Joan Madou . " " I 'm not a good actress , " the woman said . " I only played small parts . Nothing at all in the last few years . Also I do n't speak French well enough . " " What do you speak then ? " " Italian . I was brought up in Italy . And some English and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My mother is British ; she is still living in Italy ; I do n't know where . " Ravic only half listened . He was bored and he no longer knew what to talk about . " Have you done anything else ? " he asked , just for the sake of asking . " Besides those small parts you played ? " " Only what went with them . Some dancing and singing . " Ravic looked at her doubtfully . She did n't seem suited for that . There was something pale and vague about her and she was not attractive . " That may be easier to try here , " he said . " For that you need not speak perfectly . " " No . But first I have to find something . It is difficult if one does n't know anyone . " Morosow , Ravic suddenly thought . The Scheherazade . Naturally ! Morosow ought to know about such things . The idea revived him . Morosow had dragged him into this dull evening ? now the woman could be passed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he could do . " Do you know Russian ? " he asked . " A little . A few songs . Gypsy songs . They are similar to Roumanianones . Why ? " " I know someone who knows about these things . Maybe he can help you . I 'll give you his address . " " I do n't think there 's much point to it . Agents are the same everywhere . Recommendations are of little help . " Ravic realized she thought he wanted to get rid of her in the easiest way . Since that was so , he protested . " The man I mean is60T R I U M P Hnot an agent . He is the doorman of the Scheherazade . That 's a Russian night club on Montmartre . " " Doorman ? " Joan Madou lifted her head . " That is something else , " she said . " Doormen are much better informed than agents . That may be something . Do you know him well ? " Ravic looked at her in surprise . Suddenly she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of mine , " he said . " His name is Boris Morosow and he has been with the Scheherazade for the last ten years . There 's always a pretty big show . They change the numbersfrequently . He 's on good terms with the manager . If there 's no spot for you in the Scheherazade he will be sure to know of something else . Will you try it ? " " Yes . When ? " " It would be best around nine o'clock in the evening . He 's not busy then and he will have time for you . I 'll tell him about it . " Ravic looked forward to seeing Morosow 's face . Suddenly he felt better . The slight burden of responsibility he had still felt had disappeared . He had done what he could and now it was up to her . " Are you tired ? " he asked . Joan Madou looked straight into his eyes . " I 'm not tired , " she said . " But I know that it is no pleasure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I thank you for it . You took me out of my room and you spoke to me . That means a great deal to me , since I 've hardly spoken to anyone for days . Now I 'll go . You have done more than enough for me . What would have become of me other-wise ? " My God , Ravic thought , now she is starting that . He looked uncomfortably at the glass wall before him . A fat dove was trying to ravish a cockatoo . The cockatoo was so bored that she did not even shake him off . She merely went on eating and ignored him . " It was not pity . " " What else ? " The dove gave it up . He hopped down from the broad back of the cockatoo and began to clean his feathers . The cockatoo indifferentlylifted her tail and defecated . " We 'll both drink a cognac now , " Ravic said . " That 's the best answer . But believe me I 'm not really such a philanthropist . There61A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around by myself . Do you consider that particularly interesting ? " " No , but I 'm a bad partner . That 's worse . " " I 've given up looking for partners . Here 's your cognac . Salute ! " " Salute . " Ravic put his glass down . " So . And now we 'll leave this menagerie . You would n't like to go back to your hotel , would you ? " Joan Madou shook her head . " All right . Then let 's go somewhere else . Let 's go to the Scheherazade . We 'll have a drink ther  --  e both seem to need it -- and at the same time you can find out what 's going on there . " It was almost three o'clock in the morning . They stood in front of the Hotel de Milan . " Have you had enough to drink ? " Ravic asked . Joan Madou hesitated . " I thought I had enough when I was there , in the Scheherazade . But now here , looking at this doo  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done about that . Maybe we can still get something here in the hotel . Otherwise we 'll go to some bar and buy a bottle . Come . " She looked at him . Then she looked at the door . " Very well , " she said with determination . Yet she continued to stand there . " To go up there , " she said , " in that empty room ? " " I 'll go with you . And we 'll take a bottle with us . " The doorman woke up . " Have you anything to drink ? " Ravic asked . " Champagne cocktail ? " the doorman asked immediately , businesslike , but still yawning . " Thank you . Something stronger . Cognac , a bottle . " " Courvoisier , Martell , Hennessy , Bisquit Dubouchee ? " " Courvoisier . " " Very well , sir . I 'll take the cork out and bring the bottle up . " They walked upstairs . " Have you got your key ? " Ravic asked the woman . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your papers might be stolen if you do n't lock it . " 62T It I U M P H " That could happen even if I locked it . " " That 's true with these keys . Although it is n't quite as easy then . " " Maybe . But I do n't want to come in alone from outside and take a key and open a door in order to enter an empty roo  --  hat 's as if I were opening a tomb . It is enough already to have to enter this roo  --  n which nothing awaits one but a few suitcases . " " Nothing awaits us anywhere , " Ravic said . " We always have to bring everything with us . " " " That may be . But there is at least sometimes a merciful illusion . Here there 's nothing ? " Joan Madou flung her Basque beret and coat on the bed and looked at Ravic . Her eyes were light and large in her pale face and as though fixed in a furious desperation . She stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the small room back and forth , with long strides , hands in the pockets of her jacket , resilientlyswinging her body when she turned . Ravic watched her attentively . Suddenly she had strength and a catlike grace , and the room seemed much too narrow for her . There was a knock . The doorman brought in the cognac . " Would the lady and gentleman care to eat something ? " he asked . " Cold chicken , a sandwich ? " " That would be a waste of time , brother . " Ravic paid and shoved him out of the room . Then he poured two glasses full . " Here . It is simple and barbari  --  ut the more primitive the better in difficult situations . Refinement is something for quiet times . Drink this . " " And then ? " " Then you will drink another . " " I have tried that . It did n't help . It is not good to be drunk when one is alone . Things just become sharper . " " One only has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ravic sat on a narrow wobbly chaise longue which stood by the wall opposite the bed . He had n't seen it before . " Was this here when you moved in ? " he asked . She shook her head . " I had it put there . I did n't like to sleep in the bed . It seemed so pointless . A bed , and to have to undress and all that . What for ? Mornings and in the daytime it was somehowpossible . But nights ? " 63A R C H 0 " You must have something to do . " Ravic lit a cigarette . " It 's too bad we did n't meet Morosow in the Scheherazade . I did n't know that today was his day off . Do go there tomorrow night . About nine o'clock . I 'm sure he 'll find something for you . Even if it 's work in the kitchen . Then at least you would be busy at night . That 's what you want , is n't it ? " " Yes . " Joan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat down on the bed . " I 've walked about , outside , every night . As long as one walks everything is easier . Only when one sits down and the ceiling falls on one 's head ? " " Did n't anything ever happen to you on the street ? Nothing stolen ? " " No . I probably do n't look as if I had anything one could steal . " She held her empty glass out to Ravic . " And as for the othe  --  waited for it often enough . At least to have someone speak to me ! To be something more than mere nothing , mere walking ! That at least eyes would look at one , eyes and not just stones . That one would not run around like an outcast ! Like someone on a strange planet ! " She threw her hair back and took the glass that Ravic handed her . " I do n't know why I 'm talking about it , " she said . " I do n't want to . Maybe it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today for the first time ? " She interrupted herself . " Do n't listen to me ? " " I 'm drinking , " Ravic said . " Say whatever you want . It is night . No one hears you . I am listening to myself . Everything will be forgotten by tomorrow . " He leaned back . Somewhere in the house there was the sound of rushing water . The radiator rattled and the rain knocked with soft fingers at the window . " When one comes back and switches off the ligh  --  nd the darknessfalls on one like chloroform on a wad of cotton , and one turns on the light again and stares and stares ? " I must be drunk already , Ravic thought . Earlier than usual today . Or it may be the faint light . Or both . This is not the same insignificant , faded woman any longer . This is someone else . Suddenlythere are eyes . There is a face . Something is looking at me. 64T R I U M P HIt must be the shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . The first glow of drunkenness . He did not listen to what Joan Madou said . He knew about all that and no longer wanted to know about it . To be alon  --  he eternal refrain of life . It was n't better or worse than anything else . One talked too much about it . One was always and never alone . A violin , suddenl  --  omewhere out of a twiligh  --  n a garden on the hills around Budapest . The heavy scent of chestnuts . The wind . And dreams crouched on one 's shoulders like young owls , their eyes becoming lighter in the dusk . A night that never became night . The hour when all women were beautiful . He looked up . " Thank you , " Joan Madou said . " Why ? ? " Because you 've let me talk without listening . It helped me . I needed it . " Ravic nodded . He noticed that her glass was empty again . " All right , " he said . " I 'll leave the bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . A woman . Nothing else . A pale face in which there was no longer any radiance . " Do you really want to go ? " Joan Madou asked . She looked around as if someone were hidden in the room . " Here is Morosow 's address . His name , so that you wo n't forget it . Tomorrow night at nine . " Ravic wrote it on a prescription pad . Then he tore the sheet off and put it on the suitcase . Joan Madou had got up . She reached for her coat and beret . Ravic looked at her . " You need n't see me down . " " I do n't mean to do that . I just do n't want to stay here . Not now . I want to walk around somewhere . " " But you 'll have to come back again later anyhow . The same thing all over again . Why do n't you stay here ? Now that you 've already overcome it . " " It will be morning soon . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easier . " Ravic went to the window . It was still raining . Streamers , wet and gray , drifted with the wind around the yellow halos of the street lamps . " Come , " he said , " we 'll have another drink and then you 'll go to bed . This is no weather for walking . " 65A R C H 0 FHe picked up the bottle . Suddenly Joan Madou was close at his side . " Do n't leave me here , " she said quickly and urgently , and he felt her breath . " Do n't leave me here alone , tonight . I do n't know why , but not tonight ! Tomorrow I 'll have courage but tonight I ca n't be alone , I 'm weary and weak and spent , I have no strength left , you should n't have taken me ou  --  ot tonigh  --  ca n't be alone now ! " Ravic carefully put the bottle on the table and loosened her hands from his arm . " Child , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He glanced at the chaise longue . " I could sleep on that . There is no point in going anywhere else now . I need a few hours ' sleep . I have to operate at nine in the morning . I could sleep here just as well as at my own place . It would n't be my first night watch . Would that do ? " She nodded . She was still standing close beside him . " I must be out by seven-thirty . Damned early . It will wake you up . " " That does n't matter . I 'll get up and make breakfast for you , everything ? " " Nothing of the sort , " Ravic said . " I 'll have my breakfast in some cafe like a sensible workingman ; coffee with rum and croissants . I can do everything else in the hospital . It will delight me to ask Eugenie for a bath . All right , let 's stay here . Two lost souls in November . You take the bed . If you like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're ready . " " No , " Joan Madou said . " I wo n't run away . Besides we 'll need some things . Pillows , blankets , and such . " " I can ring for him . " " I can do that myself . " Ravic looked for the button . " It 's better if a man does it . " The doorman came quickly . He had another bottle of cognac in his hand . " You overrate us , " Ravic said . " Many thanks . We belong to the postwar generation . A blanket , a pillow , and some sheets . I 've got to sleep here . Too cold and too much rain outside . I had a bad case of pneumonia and it 's only two days since I left bed . Could you arrange that ? " 66T R I U M P H " Naturally , sir . I thought something of the sort myself . " " All right . " Ravic lit a cigarette . " I 'll go out into the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doors . That 's an old hobby of mine . I wo n't run away , " he said , noticing Joan Madou 's expression . " I 'm not Joseph of Egypt . I 'll not leave my coat behind . " The doorman returned with the things . He stopped abruptly when he saw Ravic standing in the hall . Then his face brightened . " It 's not often one sees anything like that , " he said . " I rarely do it myself . Only on birthdays and Christmas . Let me have those things . I 'll take them inside . What 's that ? " " A hot-water bottle . Because of your pneumonia . " " Excellent ! But I keep my lungs warm with cognac . " Ravic pulled a few bills out of his pocket . " I 'm sure you have no pajamas , sir . I could get you a pair . " " Thanks , brother . " Ravic looked at the old man . " They 'd certainly be too small for me . " " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly new . Confidentially , an American once gave them to me as a gift . He had received them from a lady . I do n't wear such things . I wear nightshirts . They are perfectly new , sir . " " All right , bring them up . Let 's have a look at them . " Ravic waited in the hall . Three pairs of shoes stood before the doors . A pair of high boots with stretchable elastic sides . Thunderoussnores emerged from the room behind . The others were a pair of brown men 's shoes and a pair of high-buttoned patent leather shoes . They both stood in front of one door and seemed strangely forlorn although they were together . The doorman brought the pajamas . They were marvelous pajamas . Blue artificial silk with gold stars on them . Ravic contemplatedthem for a while , speechless . He understood the American . " Magnificent , are n't they ? " the doorman asked proudly . The pajamas were new . They were still in the box of the Grands Magasins du Louvre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity , " Ravic said . " I 'd like to have seen the lady who chose them . " " You may have them for tonight . You do n't have to buy them , sir . " 67T R I U M P u " How much do I owe you ? " " Whatever you think . " Ravie drew his hand from his pocket . " This is too much , sir , " the doorman said . " Are n't you a Frenchman ? " " I am . From Saint-Nazaire . " " Then you 've been spoiled by the Americans . Beside  --  othing is too much for those pajamas . " " I 'm glad you like them . Good night , sir . I 'll call on the lady for them tomorrow . " ? " I 'll return them myself tomorrow morning . Wake me at seventhirty . But knock quietly . I 'll hear you . Good night . " " Look at that , " Ravic said to Joan Madou , showing her the pajamas . " A costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll even put the things on . It takes both courage and unselfconsciousnessto be ridiculous . " He arranged the blankets on the chaise longue . It did n't matter to him whether he slept in his hotel or here . In the hall he had seen a passable bathroom and had got a new toothbrush from the doorman . All the other things did n't matter . The woman was somehow like a patient . He filled a tumbler with cognac and set it at the bedside with one of the small glasses the doorman had brought . " I think that will be enough for you , " he said . " It 's simpler this way . I wo n't need to get up and refill it . I 'll take the bottle and the other glass over here with me . " " I do n't need the small glass . I can drink from the other . " " That 's even better . " Ravic arranged himself on the chaise longue . He was glad the woman was n't fussing about whether he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was n't displaying any superfluous housewifely qualities . He filled his glass and put the bottle on the floor . " Salute ! " " Salute ! " Joan Madou said . " And thanks . " " That 's all right . I was n't in the mood for walking in the rain anyway . " " Is it still raining ? " 68 " Yes . " The gentle knocking penetrated the quiet on the outsid  --  s though something wanted to come in , gray , cheerless , and formless , something that was sadder than sadnes  --  remote anonymous memory , an endless wave drifting in toward them and trying to take back and bury what it had once washed up on an island and forgotte  --  little bit of humankind and light and thought . " A good night for drinking ? " " Ye  --  nd a bad night for being alone . " Ravic remained silent for a while . " We have to get used to it , " he said then . " All that held things together before is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necklace of glass beads whose string is broken . Nothing is solid any more . " He refilled his glass . " As a boy I slept in a meadow one night . It was summer and the sky was very clear . Before I fell asleep I saw Orion on the horizon , standing above the woods . Then I woke up in the middle of the nigh  --  nd suddenly Orion was standing high above me . I have never forgotten that . I had learned that the earth is a planet and rotates ; but I had learned it as one learns something from books and does not quite realize . But now , for the first time I felt that it really was like that . I felt that the earth was silently flying through the immensities of space . I felt it so strongly that I almost believed I had to hold onto something in order not to be hurled off . Probably it happened because , emerging from a deep sleep and bereft for a moment of memory and habit , I looked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer firm ? and since then it has never become wholly firm again ? " He emptied his glass . " It makes some things more difficult and others easier . " He looked at Joan Madou . " I do n't know how far you 've gone . When you are tired enough , just do n't answer any more . " " Not yet . Soon . There 's a spot somewhere that is still awake . Awake and cold . " Ravic put the bottle down on the floor beside him . From the warmth of the room a brown tiredness trickled slowly into him . The shadows came . The flapping of wings . A strange room , night , and outside like remote drums the monotonous beating of the69T R I U M P IIwise we would all be saints . Life did not intend to make us perfect . Whoever is perfect belongs in a museum . " Joan Madou did not answer . Ravic watched her drink and lie back on her pillow . There was still somethin  --  ut he was too tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference to him . He wanted to sleep . Tomorrow he had to operate . All this no longer concerned him . He put the empty glass on the floor next to the bottle . Strange where one sometimes gets oneself , he thought. rai  --  hut and a little light on the verge of chaos , a small fire in a meaningless wildernes  --  n unknown face toward which one spoke " Have you ever felt that , too ?

When for days I had not spoken to anyone and walked for night  --  nd there were people everywhere who belonged somewher  --  ho were going somewher  --  ho were at home somewhere . Only I was n't . Then everything slowly became unrea  --  s if I were drowned and walking through a strange city under water ? " Outside someone came up the stairs . Keys jingled and a door clicked shut . Immediately afterwards water gushed from a faucet . " Why do you stay in Paris if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was getting very sleepy . " I do n't know . Where else shall I go ? " " Have n't you any place to go back to ? " " No . One can not go back . " The wind chased a shower of drops across the window . " Why did you come to Paris ? " Ravic asked . Joan Madou did not answer . He thought she had already fallen asleep . " Raszinsky and I came to Paris because we wanted to separate , " she said then . Ravic heard it without surprise . There were hours when nothingsurprised one . In the room opposite , the man who had just come in began to vomit . They heard his muffled gasps through the door . " Then why were you so desperate ? " Ravic asked . " Because he was dead ! Dead ! Suddenly he was no more ! Never to be called back again ! Dead ! No chance to make things right ! Do n't you understand ? " Joan Madou sat up in bed and stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought : It is not true . Not because he was dead . Because he left you before you could leave him . Because he left you alone before you were ready. "  --  should have been different to hi  --  was ? " " Forget it . Regret is the most useless thing in the world . One can not recall anything . And one can not rectify anything . Other-70 1 716Lucienne Martinetwas sitting by the window when Ravic came in . " How does it feel , " he asked , " to be out of bed for the first time ? " The girl looked at him and then out at the gray afternoon and back at Ravic . " Not very good weather today , " he said . " It is , " she replied . " For me it is. " " gyp ? " Because I do n't have to go out . " She sat crouched in her chair , a cheap cotton kimono with poppieson it drawn around her shoulders , a slender insignificant being with poor teet  --  ut to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troy . She was a piece of life he had rescued with his own hands . It was nothing to be particularly proud of ; one he had lost shortly before ; the next he might lose , too ; and in the end one lost all of them and oneself too . But this girl , for the moment , was saved . " It 's no fun to drag around hats in weather like this , " Lucienne said . " Did you deliver hats ? " " Yes . For Madame Lanvert . That shop in the Avenue Matignon . We had to work until five . Then I had to deliver hatboxes to the customers . Now it is five-thirty . By this time I would be on my way . " She looked out of the window . " Too bad it is n't raining harder . It was better yesterday . It poured . Now someone else has to go through it . " Ravic sat down opposite her on a seat by the window . Strange , he thought . One always expects people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever are . Nor is this one . A minorA R C H 0 F T R I U P Hmiracle happened to her and the only thing that interests her about it is that she does n't have to walk through the rain . " How did you happen to come to just this hospital , Lucienne ? " he asked . She looked at him warily . " Someone told me about it . " " Who ? " " An acquaintance . " " What acquaintance ? " The girl hesitated . " An acquaintance who was here , too . I brought her here . Up to the door . That 's why I knew about it . " " When was that ? " " A week before I came . " " Was it the one who died during the operation ? " " Yes . " " And nevertheless you came here ? " " Yes , " Lucienne said indifferently . " Why not ? " Ravic did not say what he had intended to say . He looked into the small cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so quickly made hard . " Did you go to the same midwife , too ? " he asked . Lucienne did'not answer . " Or to the same doctor ? You needn'tbe afraid of telling me . After all I do n't know who it was . " " Mary went there first . A week earlier . Ten days earlier . " " And you went there later in spite of the fact that you knewwhat had happened to her ? " Lucienne raised her shoulders . " What could I do ? I had to risk it . I did n't know of anyone else . A chil  --  hat would I do with a child ? " She looked out of the window again . On a balcony opposite stood a man in suspenders , holding an umbrella . " How much longer will I have to stay here , doctor ? " " About one week . " " One week more ? " " That 's not long . Why ? " " It costs and costs ? " " Maybe we can make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I can pay it off in installments ? I have n't enough money . It is expensive , thirty francs a day . " " Who told you that ? " 72 73A x C H o F " The nurse . " " Which one ? Eugenie of course ? " " Yes . She said the operation and the bandages would cost extra . Is that very expensive ? " " You have paid for the operation . " " The nurse said it had n't been nearly enough . " " The nurse does n't know much about that , Lucienne . You 'd better ask Doctor Veber later . " " I 'd like to know soon . " " why ? " " Then I can plan the length of time I 'll have to work to pay it off . " Lucienne looked at her hands . Her fingers were thin and pricked . " I 've another month 's rent to pay , " she said . " When I came here , it was the thirteenth . I should have given notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another month . For nothing . " " Have n't you got anyone to help you ? " Lucienne glanced up . Suddenly her face seemed ten years older . " You know about that yourself , doctor . He was just angry . He did n't know I was so ignorant . Otherwise he would n't have had anything to do with me . " Ravic nodded . Things like this were n't new to him . " Lucienne , " he said , " we could try to get something from the woman who did the abortion . It was her fault . All you need do is to give us her name . " The girl straightened up quickly . Suddenly she was all resistance . " Police ? No ! Then I 'd get mixed up in it myself . " " Without police . We would only threaten . " She laughed bitterly . " You wo n't get anything from her that way . She is made of iron . I had to pay her three hundred francs . And for that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any luck , " she said without resignation as if she spoke of someone else and not of herself . " On the contrary , " Ravic replied . " You had a lot of luck . " He saw Eugenie in the operating room . She was polishing nickelplatedinstruments . It was one of her hobbies . She was so absorbed in her work that she did not hear him come in. 74T 11 I U M P H " Eugenie , " he said . She turned around , startled . " Oh you ! Do you always have to frighten people ? " " I do n't think I have that much personality . But you should n't frighten the patients with your stories about fees and costs . " Eugenie drew herself up , the polishing rags in her hand . " Naturallythat whore had to blab right away . " " Eugenie , " Ravic said , " there are more whores among women who have never slept with a man than among those who make their difficult living that way . Not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blabbing . You just spoiled the day for her . That 's all . " " What of it ? Sensitive and leading that sort of life ! " You walking moral catechism , Ravic thought . You disgusting model of conscious virtu  --  hat do you know of the forlornness of this little milliner who courageously went to the same midwife who had ruined her frien  --  nd to the same hospital in which the other had die  --  nd who has nothing to say except : What else could I have done ? And : How can I pay for it ? " You should marry , Eugenie , " he said . " A widower with children . Or the owner of a funeral parlor . " " Mr. Ravic , " the nurse replied with dignity , " will you kindly not concern yourself with my private affairs ? Otherwise I 'll have to complain to Doctor Veber . " " You do that anyway all day long . " Ravic was pleased to see two red spots appear over her cheekbones . " Why are pious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best character ; idealists are the least bearable . Does n't that make you think ? " " Thank God , no . " " That 's what I thought . I am going now to the children of sin . To the Osiris . Just in case Doctor Veber should need me . " " I hardly think Doctor Veber will need you . " " Virginity does not quite bestow clairvoyance . He might need me . I 'll be there until about five . Then at my hotel . " " Nice hotel , that den of Jews ! " Bavic turned around . " Eugenie , all refugees are not Jews . Not75even all Jews are Jews . And many of whom you would n't believe it are Jews . I even knew a Jewish Negro once . He was a terribly lonely man . The only thing he loved was Chinese food . That 's how life is . " The nurse did not answer . She was polishing a nickel plate that was completely spotless . Ravic was sitting in the bistro on the Rue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man . It was like a blow in the solar plexus . In the first moment he felt only the shock without realizing what it wa  --  ut in the next second he had pushed the table aside , jumped from his seat , and thrust himselfruthlessly toward the door through the crowded place ... . Someone caught him by the arm and held onto him . He turned around . " What ? " he asked uncomprehendingly . " What ? " It was the waiter . " You did not pay , sir . " " What ? ? Oh yes ? I 'll be back ? " He pulled his arm free . The waiter flushed . " We do n't allow that here . You have to ? " " Here ? " Ravic pulled a bill out of his pocket , flung it at the waiter , and thrust the door open . He pushed past a group of people and ran around the corner to the right , along the Rue Boissiere . Someone yelled behind him . He recollected himself , stopped running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being conspicuous . It is impossible , he thought , it is absolutely impossible , I must be mad , it is impossible ! The face , that face , it must be a resemblance , some kind of damned devilish resemblance , an idiotic trick played by my nerve  --  t can not be in Paris , that face , it is in Germany , it is in Berlin , the window was swept by rain , one could n't see through it clearly , I must have been mistaken , certainly .. . He pushed himself through the crowd letting out from a movie , hastily , searching every face he passed ; he peered beneath hats , he met irritated and astonished looks , he went on , on , other faces , other hats , gray , black , blue , he passed them , he turned back , he stared at themHe stopped at the intersection of the Avenue Kleber . He sud-76denly remembered , a woman , a woman with a poodl  --  nd immediatelybehind her he had seen that man . He had long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked back . Seeing the woman with the dog from a distance , he stopped at the curb . He clenched his fists in his pockets , and he painstakingly watched every passer-by . The poodle stopped at a lamppost , sniffed , and lifted its hind leg with infinite deliberation . Then he ceremoniously scratched the pavement and ran on . Ravic suddenly felt his neck wet with perspiration . He waited another few minute  --  he face did not appear . He looked into the parked cars . No one was in them . He turned back again and , walked quickly to the subway at the Avenue Kleber . He ran down into the entrance , bought a ticket , and walked along the platform . There were a good many people there . Before he got through searching , a train thundered in , stopped , and disappeared in the tunnel . The platform was empty . Slowly he walked back to the bistro . He sat down at the table at which he had been sitting . The glass half full of calvados was still there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The waiter shuffled toward Ravic . " Excuse me , sir , I did n't ' know ? " " Never mind ! " Ravic said . " Bring me another calvados . " " Another ? " The waiter looked at the half-filled glass on . the table . " Do n't you want to drink that first ? " " No . Bring me another . " The waiter lifted the glass and smelled . it . " Is n't it good ? " " It 's all right , only I want another . " " Very well , sir . " I was mistaken , Ravic thought . This rain-swept window , partly blurre  --  ow could anything be positively recognized ? He stared through the window . He stared attentively , like a hunter lying in wait , he watched every person passing b  --  ut , at the same time , gray and sharp , a moving picture flashed shadowlike across it , a shred of memory .. . Berlin . A summer evening in 1933 . The house of the Gestapo Blood ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked electric bulbs ; a red-stained table with binding straps ; the night-77A . R C H O Ftortured clarity of his brain that had been startled out of unconsciousnessa dozen times by being half choked in a pail of water ; his kidneys so beaten they no longer ached ; the distorted , helpless face of Sybil before him ; a couple of torturers in uniform holding he  --  nd a smiling face and a voice explaining in a friendly way what would happen to Sybil if a confession were not forthcoming ? Sybil who three days later was reported to have been found hanged ... . The waiter appeared and put the glass on the table . " This is anotherbrand , sir . Didier from Caen , older . " " All right . Thanks . " " Ravic emptied his glass . He got a package of cigarettes out of his pocket , took one out and lit it . His hands were not yet steady . He flung the match on the floor and ordered another calvados . That face , that smiling face which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been mistaken . It was impossible that Haake was in Paris . Impossible ! He shook off the memories . It was senselessto drive oneself mad about it as long as one could n't do anything . The time for that would come when everything back there collapsed and one could return . Till then .. . He called the waiter and paid . But he could not help searching every face on the streets . He was sitting with Morosow in the Catacombs . " Do you think it was he ? " Morosow asked . " No . But he looked it . A cursed sort of resemblance . Or my memory is no longer to be trusted . " " Bad luck that you were in the bistro . " " Yes . " Morosow remained silent awhile . " Makes one damn jumpy , does n't it ? " he said then . " No . Why ? " " Because one does n't know . " " I know . " Morosow did not reply . " Ghosts , " Ravic said . " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One never is . I went through the same thing . Especially at the7 8T I I I U M P Hbeginning . During the first five or six years . I 'm still waiting for three of them who are in Russia . There were seven . Four have died . Two of them were shot by their own party . I 've been waiting now for more than twenty years . Since 1917 . One of the three who is still alive must be seventy by now . The other two , about forty or fifty . They 're the ones I still hope I 'll get . They are for my father . " Ravic looked at Boris . He was over sixty , but a giant . " You will get them , " he said . " Yes . " Morosow opened and closed his big hands . " That 's what I 'm waiting for . That 's why I live more carefully . I do n't drink so often now . It may take some time yet . And I 've got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " " Neither do I. " They sat for a while . " Shall we play a game of chess ? " Morosow ' asked . " Yes . But I do n't see any board free . " " There , the professor is through playing . He played with Levy . As usual he won . " Ravic went for the board and the chessmen . " You 've played a long time , professor , " he said . " The whole afternoon . " The old man nodded . " It distracts you . Chess is more perfect than any game of cards . At cards you have good luck or bad luck . It is n't sufficiently diverting . Chess is a world in itself . While one is playing , it takes the place of the outside world . " He raised his inflamed eyes . " Which is not so perfect . " Levy , his partner , suddenly bleated . Then he was silent , turned around , frightened , and followed the professor . They played two games . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To open doors for the cream of humankind . Why do n't you drop in any more at the Scheherazade ? " " I do n't know . Just chance . " " How about tomorrow night ? " " I ca n't tomorrow . I am having dinner at Maxim 's . " Morosow grinned . " For an illegal refugee you have.a lot of nerve to hang out in the most elegant places in Paris . " " They are the only ones where you are entirely safe , you secure79owner of a Nansen passport . One who behaves like a refugee is soon caught . You still should remember that much . " " All right . With whom are you going then ? With the German Ambassador as another protection ? " " With Kate Hegstroem . " Morosow whistled . " Kate Hegstroem , " he said . " Is she back ? " " She is arriving tomorrow morning . From Vienna . " " Fine . Then I 'll be seeing you later in the Scheherazade anyway . " " Maybe not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scheherazade is Kate Hegstroem 's headquarters when she is in Paris . You know that as well as I do . " " This time it 's different . She 'll be going into the hospital . To be operated on one of the next few days . " " That 's just why she will come . You do n't understand women . " Morosow narrowed his eyes . " Or do n't you want her to come ? " " Why not ? " " It just occurs to me that you have n't been with us since you sent us that woman . Joan Madou . Seems to be not just chance . " " Nonsense . I do n't even know that she is still with you . Could you use her ? " " Yes . First she was in the chorus . Now she has a short solo number . Two or three songs . " " Has she got adjusted meanwhile ? " " Naturally . Why not ? " " She was damned desperate . Poor devil . " " What ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morosow smiled . " Ravic , " he replied in a fatherly manner with a face in which suddenly there were steppes , space , knowledge , and all the experience in the world , " do n't talk nonsense . That woman is quite a bitch . " " What ? " Ravic asked . " A bitch . No prostitute . A bitch . If you were a Russian you would understand . " Ravic shook his head . " Then she must have changed a lot . So long , Boris ! God bless your eyes ! " 807 " When do I have to be at the hospital , Ravic ? " Kate Hegstroem asked . " Tomorrow night . We 'll operate the day after . " She stood before him , slim , boyish , self-assured , pretty , and no longer quite young . " This time I 'm afraid , " she said . " I do n't know why . But I 'm afraid . " " You need n't be . It is a routine matter . " Ravic had removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken a liking to each other and since then had been friends . Sometimes she disappeared for months and then one day she would suddenly return . She was something like a mascot to him . Her appendectomy was the first operation he had performed in Paris . She had brought him luck . Since that time he had continued to work and had had no further difficulties with the police . She went over to the window and looked out . There lay the courtyard of the Hotel Lancaster . A huge old chestnut tree stretched its naked arms upward toward the wet sky . " This rain , " she said . " I left Vienna and it was raining . I awoke in Zurich and it was raining . And now here ? " She pushed the curtains back . " I do n't know what 's the matter with me . I think I 'm growing old . " " One always thinks that when one is n't . " " I should be different . I was divorced two weeks ago . I should be gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ravic . Why ? " " Nothing repeats itself . We repeat ourselves , that 's all . " She smiled and sat down on a sofa that stood beside the artificialfireplace . " It 's good to be back , " she said . " Vienna has become a military barracks . Disconsolate . The Germans have81T R I U M P H " Yes , " she said and looked at him . " All right then . Adieu , Kate . I 'll call for you at eight tonight " " Adieu , Ravic . I 'm going now to buy an evening dress at Mainbocher . I must get rid of this tiredness . And the feeling of being caught in a spider web . That Vienna , " she said with a bitter smile . " The city of dreams ? " Ravic went down in the elevator and walked through the hall past the bar . A few Americans were sitting there . In the center a huge bunch of red gladioli stood on a table . In the gray diffused light suddenly they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came closer did he notice that they were perfectly fresh . It was merely the light from outside that made them appear so . He looked at them for some time . There was much commotion on the second floor of the International . A number of rooms stood open , the maids and the valet were running to and fro , and the proprietress was directing all this from the corridor . Ravic came down the stairs . " What 's going on here ? " he asked . The proprietress was a buxom woman with a huge bosom and a too small head with short black curls . " The Spaniards have left , " the said . " I know . But why are you tidying up the rooms so late in the night ? " " We need them tomorrow morning " " New German refugees ? " " No , Spanish . " " Spanish ? " Ravic asked , for a moment not understanding what the meant . " How is that ? Have n't they just left ? " The landlady looked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a smile of simplest understanding and simplest irony . The others are coming back , " she said . " Which others ? " " The opposition . But that 's always so . " She called a few words o the girl who was doing the cleaning . " We are an old hotel , " she ; aid then with a certain pride . " Our guests like to return to us . They wait for their old rooms . Naturally a number of them have83A R C H 0 Ftrampled it down . And with them the Austrians . The Austrians too , Ravic . I thought that would be a contradiction of nature : an Austrian Nazi . But I 've seen them . " " That is not surprising , Kate . Power is the most contagious dis-ease . " " Yes . And the most deforming . That 's why I asked for a divorce . This charming idler whom I married two years ago suddenly became a shouting stormtroop leader who made old Professor Bernstein wash the streets while he stood by and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cured him of an inflammation of the kidneys . Pretending that the fee had been too high . " Kate Hegstroem drew in her lips . " The fee which I 'd paid , not he . " Be glad you are rid of him . " " He asked two hundred fifty thousand schillings for the divorce . " " Cheap , " Ravic said . " Anything you can settle with money is cheap . " " He got nothing . " Kate Hegstroem raised her oval face , which was flawlessly cut like a gem . " I told him what I thought about him , his party , and his leade  --  nd that from now on I would say this publicly . He threatened me with the Gestapo and the concentration camp . I laughed at him . I am still an American and under the protection of the Embassy . Nothing would happen to m  --  ut to him because he was married to me . " She laughed . " He had not thought of that . He made no trouble from then on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like something from another life . " I wonder that Bernstein is still able to practice , " he said . " He no longer can . He examined me secretly when I had the first hemorrhage . Thank God , I ca n't have a child . A child by a Nazi ? " She shuddered . Ravic rose . " I must go now . You will be examined once more by Veber in the afternoon . Just for form 's sake . " " I know . Nevertheles  --  am afraid this time . " " But , Kat  --  t is n't the first time . It 's simpler than the removal of your appendix . " Ravic took her lightly around her shoulder . " You were my first operation here . That 's like one 's first love .. I 'll take good care of you . " 82A R C H 0 Fbeen killed meanwhile . But the others have waited in Biarritz and Saint-Jean-de-Luz until rooms were vacant . " Ravic looked at the landlady , astonished . " When were they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ravic ! " She was surprised that he did not understand right away . " Of course during that time when Primo de Rivera was dictator in Spain . They had to escape then and they lived here . When Spain became republican they went back and the monarchistsand Fascists came here . Now the latter have gone back and the republicans are returning . Those that are still left . A merry-go-round . " " Yes , indeed , " Ravic said . " A merry-go-round . " The landlady looked into one of the rooms . A colored print of the former King Alfonso hung over the bed . " Take that down , Jeanne , " she called . The girl brought the picture . " Here . Put it over here . " The landladyleaned the picture against the wall to her right and walked on . In the next room hung a picture of Generalissimo Franco . " This one too . Put it with the others . " " Why did n't these Gomez people take their pictures with them ? " Ravic asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back , " the landlady declared . " Pictures are a comfort in a foreign land . When one returns one no longer needs them . Also the frames are too inconvenient to travel with and the glass breaks easily . Picturesare almost always left in hotels . " She put two other portraits of the fat generalissimo , one of Alfonso , and a smaller one of Queipo de Llano with the others in the corridor . " The holy pictures can be left inside , " she decided when she discovered a Madonna in glaring colors . " Saints are neutral . " " Not always , " Ravic said . " In difficult periods God always has a chance . I have even seen atheists praying here . " With an energetic movement the landlady adjusted her left breast . " Have n't you ever prayed when the water was up to your neck ? " " Naturally . But I 'm not an atheist . I am only a reluctant be-liever . " T R I U M P HThe valet came up the stairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you going to redecorate ? " Ravic asked . " Of course . One must have much tact in the hotel business . That 's what really gives a house a good reputation . Particularly with our kind of customers who , I can actually say , are very sensitiveabout these things . One hardly expects someone to enjoy a room in which his archenemy looks down on him proudly in bright colors and sometimes even out of a gold frame . Am I not right ? " " One hundred per cent . " The landlady turned toward the valet . " Put these pictures here , Adolphe . No , you 'd better put them in the light against the wall , one next to the other , so that we can see them . " The man growled and bent down to prepare the exhibition . " What will you hang in there now ? " Ravic asked , interested . " Deer and landscapes and eruptions of Vesuvius and the like ? " " Only if there are n't enough . Otherwise I 'll put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Those from before . Those the gentlemen left here when they took over the government . Here they are . " She pointed at the left wall of the corridor . The valet had set up the new pictures in a row opposite those which had been taken out of the rooms . There were two of Marx , three of Lenin with the half of one pasted over with paper , a picture of Trotzky , and a few black and white prints of Negrin and other republican leaders of Spain , in smaller frames . They were less conspicuous and none of them was so resplendent with color and decorations and emblemsas the pompous row of Alfonsos , Primos , and Francos which stood opposite them on the right . It was a strange sight : those two rows of opposed philosophies silently staring at each other in the dimly lit corridor and between them the French landlady with the tact , experience , and the ironic wisdom of her race . " I saved these things at that time , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days . You see I was righ  --  ow they come in handy . One has to be farsighted in the hotel business . " 84 85A R C Ii 0 FShe gave orders where to hang the pictures . She sent back the picture of Trotzky . She was not sure about him . Ravic examined the print of Lenin with the half pasted over . He scratched off part of the paper along the line of Lenin 's hea  --  nd from under the piece of paper emerged another head , Trotzky 's , smiling at Lenin . Very likely a follower of Stalin had pasted it over . " Here , " Ravic said . " Another hidden Trotzky . From the good old days of friendship and fraternity . " The landlady took the picture . " We can throw this one away . It is completely valueless . One half of it persistently insults the other half . " She gave it to the valet . " Keep the frame , Adolphe . It is good oak wood . " " What will you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alfonsosand Francos ? " " They 'll go into the cellar . You can never tell whether or not you will need them again one day . " " Your cellar must be a wonderful place . A contemporary mausoleum . Have you still other pictures there ? " " Oh naturally ; we have other Russian one  --  few simpler pictures of Lenin in cardboard frames , as a last resource , and then those of the last Czar . From Russians who died here . A wonderful original in oil and in a heavy gold frame from a man who committedsuicide . Then there are the Italian pictures . Two Garibaldis , three kings , and a somewhat damaged newspaper cut of Mussolini from the days when he was a socialist in Zurich . Certainly that thing has only curiosity value . No one would like to have it hung up . ' " Have you German pictures too ? " " Still a few of Marx ; they are the most common ; one Lassalle , one Bebe  --  hen a group picture with Ebert , Scheidemann , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been smeared with ink . The gentlemen told me that he became a Nazi . " " That 's right . You may hang it with the socialistic Mussolini . You have none from the opposite side in Germany , eh ? " " We have ! We have one Hindenburg , one Kaiser Wilhelm , one Bismarck , and " ? the landlady smiled ? " even one of Hitler in a raincoat . It 's a pretty complete collection . " 86T R I U M P H " What ? " Ravic said . " Hitler ? Where did you get him ? " " From a homosexual . He came in 1934 when Roehm and the others were killed there . He was full of fear and prayed a lot . Later a rich Argentinean took him along . His first name was Putzi . Do you want to see the picture ? It is in the cellar . " " Not now . Not in the cellar . I 'd rather see it when all the rooms in the hotel are filled with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for a moment . " Ah so , " she said then . " You mean when they come as refugees . " Boris Morosow was standing in front of the Scheherazade in his uniform with the gold braid and he opened the door of the taxi . Ravic stepped out . Morosow smiled . " I thought you were n't com-ing . " " I did n't intend to . " " I forced him , Boris . " Kate Hegstroem embraced Morosow . " Thank God , I am back again with you ! " " You have a Russian soul , Katja . Heaven knows why you had to be born in Boston . Come , Ravic . " Morosow thrust the entrance door open . " Man is great in his intentions , but weak in carrying them out . Therein lie our misery and our charm . " The Scheherazade was decorated like a Caucasian tent . The waiters were Russians in Red Circassian uniforms . The orchestra was composed of Russian and Roumanian gypsies . People sat at small tables which stood by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate-glass tops illuminated from below . The place was dim and quite crowded . " What would you like to drink , Kate ? " Ravic asked . " Vodka . And have the gypsies play . I 've had enough of the Vienna Woods ' played in march time . " She slipped her feet out of her shoes and lifted them onto the banquette . " Now I 'm not tired any more , Ravic , " she said . " A few hours of Paris have alreadychanged me . But I still feel as if I had escaped from a concentration camp . Can you imagine that ? " He looked at her . " Approximately , " he replied . The Circassian brought a small bottle of vodka and glasses . Ravic filled them and handed one to Kate Hegstroem . She drained87A R C H 0 Fthe glass quickly and thirstily and put it back . Then she looked around . " A moth-eaten hole , " she said and smiled . " But at night it becomes a cave of refuge and of dreams . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass top of the table illumined her face . " Why , Ravic ? Everything becomes more colorful at night . Nothing appears difficult then , you think you are able to do anything , and what one can not achieve is made up for by dreams . Why ? " He smiled . " We have our dreams because without them we could not bear the truth . " The orchestra began to tune their instruments . A few empty fifths and a few runs on a violin fluttered through the room . " You do n't look like a man who would deceive himself with dreams , " Kate Hegstroem said . " You can deceive yourself with truth too . That 's an even more dangerous dream . " The orchestra started to play . In the beginning there were the cymbals only . The soft muted hammers plucked a melody out of the darkness , low , almost inaudible , threw it high into a soft glissandoand passed it hesitantly on to the violins . The gypsy approached their table slowly across the dance floor . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with bold eyes and an ardently greedy face . Without his violin he might have been a cattle deale  --  ith it he was a messenger of the steppes , of spacious evenings , of horizons , and of all that never becomes reality . Kate Hegstroem felt the melody like fountain water in April on her skin . Suddenly she was full of echoes ; but there was no one who called her . Scattered voices murmured , vague shreds of memoryfluttered , sometimes there was a shimmering like brocade , but they all whirled away and there was no one who called her . No one called . The gypsy bowed . From under the table Ravic slipped a bill into his hand . Kate Hegstroem moved in her corner . " Have you ever been happy , Ravic ? " " Often . " 88T R I U M P H " I do n't mean that . I mean really happy , breathlessly , unthinkingly , with everything you have . " Ravic looked into the agitated small face before him that knew only one interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and none of the others . " Often , Kate , " he said and meant something quite different and knew it was not that either . " You do n't want to understand me . Or to talk about it . Who is that now singing with the orchestra ? " " I do n't know . I have n't been here for a long time . " " You ca n't see the woman from here . She is not with the gypsies . She must be sitting somewhere at a table . " " Then very likely it 's a guest . That happens often here . " " A strange voice , " Kate Hegstroem said . " At once sad and re-bellious . " " That 's the songs . " " Or I am it . Suddenly . Do you understand what she is singing ? " " Ja vass lovbil  --  love you . It 's a song by Pushkin . " " Do you know Russian ? " " Only as much as Morosow has taught me . Mostly curses . Russianis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like to talk about yourself , do you ? " " I do n't even like to think about myself . " She sat awhile . " Sometimes I think the old life has gone , " she said then . " The freeness from care , the expectatio  --  ll that was before . " Ravic smiled . " It 's never gone , Kate . Life is much too great a thing to be gone before we stop breathing . " She did not listen to what he said . " There is a fear often , " she said . " A sudden unexplainable fear . As if the world outside may suddenly have collapsed when we leave here . Do you know that , too ? " " Yes , Kate . Everyone knows that . It is a European disease . For the last twenty years . " She fell silent . " But that is no longer Russian , " she said then and listened to the music . " No . That is Italian . Santa Lucia Luntana . " The spotlight moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H 0 F T R I U M P H h , orchestra . Now Ravic saw the woman who was singing . It was Joan Madou . She was sitting alone , with one elbow resting on the table , looking straight ahead as if she were in thought and no one else there beside her . Her face was very pale in the white light . It no longer had anything of the flat , blurred look that he knew . Suddenlyit was of an exciting forlorn beauty and he remembered having seen it once , fleetingly , like tha  --  he night in her room ? but then he had thought it was the soft deception of drunkenness and also it had faded away immediately thereafter and disappeared . Now it was there , wholly , and even more . " What 's the matter , Ravic ? " Kate Hegstroem asked . He turned around . " Nothing . I know that song . A Neapolitan heart-wringer . " " Memories ? " " No . I have no memories . " He said it more vehemently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sometimes I really wish I knew what is the matter with you , Ravic . " He made a defensive motion . " Nothing more than with anyone else . Today the world is full of involuntary adventurers . Every refugee hotel is crowded with them . And everyone 's story would have been a sensation for Alexandre Dumas or Victor Hugo ; now we begin to yawn even before he starts to tell it . Here is another vodka for you , Kate . Nowadays the greatest adventure is a simple life . " The orchestra began to play a blues . They played dance music rather badly . A few guests started dancing . Joan Madou rose and walked toward the exit . She walked as if the place were empty . Ravic suddenly recalled what Morosow had said about her . She passed quite close to Ravic 's table . It seemed to him that she saw him , but her eyes at once swept on indifferently beyond him , and she left the room . " Do you know that woman ? " asked Kate Hegstroem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 908 " Do you see that , Veber ? " Ravic asked . " Iler  --  nd her  --  nd here ? " Veber bent over the clamped-open incision . " Yes . " " These small nodules her  --  nd her  --  hat 's not a swelling nor is it an adhesion ? " NoRavic straightened up . " Cancer , " he said . " A clear , unmistakable case of cancer ! This is the damnedest operation I 've performed in years . The speculum does n't show anything , the pelvic examinationan insignificant softness at one side only , a slight swelling , the possibility of a cyst or of a fibroma , nothing of importance , but we have to make an abdominal approach , so we cut and suddenly find a carcinoma . " Veber looked at him . " What do you want to do ? " " We can make a frozen section . To get a microscopic report . Is Boisson still in the laboratory ? " " Certainly .

" Ravic looked at Kate Hegst  --  em 's body which , head low , lay on the operating table in the Trendelenburg position. 91 A R C A 0 F " She should know beforehand . She should give her consent . We simply ca n't just go ahead like this . Or can we ? " " Not according to the law . On the other han  --  e have already begun . " " That we had to do . We could not do the abortion without an abdominal approach . This is quite another operation . To remove the uterus is different from an abortion . " " I believe she trusts you , Ravic . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she agree ? " He adjusted the rubber apron under the white coat with his elbow . " Nevertheless ? first I could try to explore further . Then we can still decide whether to do the hysterectomy . Knife , Eugenie . " He lengthened the incision to the navel and clamped the smaller blood vessels . Then he stopped the larger ones with double knots , took another knife , and cut through the yellow fascia . He fixed the muscles underneath with the back of the knife , then he pulled up the peritoneum , opened and clipped it . " The retractor . " The assistant nurse held it ready . She threw the weighted chain between Kate Hegstroem 's legs and hooked on the bladder plate . " Dressings ! " He pressed in the damp warm dressing , laid open the abdominal cavity and carefully applied the grasping forceps . Then he glanced up . " Look here , Vebe  --  nd her  --  he broad ligament . This thick hard mass . Impossible to apply the Kocher forceps . It has gone too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " Look at that , " Ravic said . " We can not clamp the arteries . Brittle . It 's spreading here too . Hopeless ? " He carefully snipped off a small piece . " Is Boisson in the labora- tory ? " " Yes , " the infirmiere said . " I have telephoned . He is waiting . " " All right . Have this sent to him . We can wait for the report . It wo n't take more than ten minutes . " " Tell him to telephone , " Veber said . " Immediately . We 'll sus- pend the operation . " Ravic straightened up . " How is the pulse ? " " Ninety-five. " 92T Ii I U M P H " Blood pressure ? " " One hundred fifteen . " " All right . Veber , we do n't need to decide whether to operate with or without consent . There 's nothing more we can do . " Veber nodded . " We 'll have to sew her up , " Ravic said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and say nothing . " He stood there for a moment and looked at the open body beneath the white sheets . The piercing light made the sheets appear even whiter , like new-fallen snow , under which yawned the red crater of the gaping wound . Kate Hegstroem , thirty-four years old , capricious , slender , tanned , filled with the will to liv  --  entenced to death by this nebulous invisible touch that was destroying her tissues . He bent over the body again . " We still have to ? " The child . A groping life , blind , still grew in this distintegrating body . Doomed with it . Still feeding , sucking , eager , only a drive toward growth , something that would one day want to play in gardens , that would want to become somebody , an engineer , a priest , a soldier , a murderer , a human being , something that would want to live , to suffer , to be happy and to go to piece  --  lFe instrumentcarefully slid along the invisible wall , found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .

" Any report from Boisson yet ? " " Not yet . It should be here any minute now . " " We can wait another few minutes . " Ravic stepped back . " Pulse ? " He glanced over the shield into Kate Hegstroem 's eyes . They were open and she looked at hi  --  ot with a glazed expression , but as if she saw him and knew everything . For a moment he thought she was conscious . He took a step forward and halted . Impossible . What was he thinking of ? It was an accident : the light . The pupils had reacted to light during the narcosis . " How is her pulse ? " 93iA a C H 0 F " One hundred . Blood pressure , one hundred twelve . It 's going down ! " " Time 's getting short , " Ravic said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subdued ringing of the telephone downstairs . Veber turned toward the door . Ravic did not look up . He waited . He heard the door being opened . The nurse entered . " Yes , " Veber said . " Carcinoma . " Ravic nodded and went back to work . He lifted the forceps and the clips . He removed the retractor ; the dressings . Eugenie , at his side , mechanically counted the instruments . He began stitching . Lightly , methodically , painstakingly , completelyconcentrated and without a single thought . The grave closed , the layers of flesh were drawn together to the last , outermostone ; he put on the clips for the skin and straightened up . " Fin-ished . " Eugenie stepped on the lever bringing the operating table to a horizontal position and covered Kate Hegstroem . Scheherazade , Ravic thought , the day before yesterday , a dress from Mainbocher , have you ever been happy , often , I am afraid , a routine matter , let the gypsies play . He looked at the clock above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and factory doors were opening now and healthy people streaming out . Lunch time . The two nurses rolled the level stretcher out of the operating room . Ravic tore the rubber gloves from his hands , went into the washroom , and began to wash . " Your cigarette , " Veber said , washing himself at the other basin . " You 'll burn your lips . " " Yes , thanks . Who will tell her , Veber ? " " You will , " Veber declared unhesitatingly . " We 'll have to explain to her why we had to operate . She expectedus to do it from the inside . We ca n't tell her what it really was . " " Something will occur to you , " Veber said confidently . " You think so ? " " Of course . After all , you 've got until tonight . " " And you ? " T I l I U M P II " She would n't believe anything I 'd say . She knows that you operated and she 'll want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious if I told her . " " That 's right . " " I still do n't understand it , " Veber said . " How it could develop in such a short time . " " It can . I wish I knew what to tell her . " " You 'll think of something , Ravic . A cyst of some sort or a fibroma . " " Yes , " Ravic said . " Some sort of cyst or fibroma " At night he went to the hospital again . Kate Hegstroem was sleeping . She had awakened in the evening , had vomited , spent a restless hour , and had then fallen asleep again . " Did she ask anything ? " " No , " said the red-cheeked nurse . " She was still drowsy and asked no questions . " " I think she 'll sleep until morning . In case she wakes up and asks questions , tell her everything went well . She 's to go back to sleep . Give her something if necessary . If she should become restless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word at the hotel where to find me . " He stood in the street like someone who had for once escaped . A few hours ' grace before he had to lie to a trusting face . Suddenlythe night seemed warm and shimmering . The gray scab of life was once again mercifully covered over by a few borrowed hours which flew up like doves . They too were lie  --  ne had to pay for everythin  --  hey were a postponement only ; but what was n't ? Was not everything postponement , merciful postponement , a bright flag which covered the remote , black , inexorably nearing gate ? He went into a bistro and took a seat at one of the marble tables at the window . The room was smoky and full of noise . The waiter came . " A Dubonnet and a package of Colonials . " He opened the package and lighted one of the black cigarettes . At the table next to him some Frenchmen were discussing their corrupt government and the Munich pact . Ravic only half listened. 95Everyone knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one did anything to stop i  --  ostponement , another year 's postponemen  --  hat was all they managed to struggle for . Postponementhere too , again and again . He emptied the glass of Dubonnet . The sweetish dull flavor of the aperitif filled his mouth with a flat distaste . Why had he ordered it ? He called the waiter . " A fine . " He looked through the window and shook his thoughts off . If there was nothing to be done , one should n't drive oneself crazy . He recalled the time when he had learned this lesson . One of the great lessons of his lifeIt was in August , 1916 , near Ypres . The company had returned from the front the day before . It had been a quiet section in which they were used for the first time since they had been sent into the field . Nothing had happened . Now they were lying in the warm August sun around a small fire , frying potatoes they had found in the fields . A minute later nothing was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the fir  --  hen he came to himself again , whole , uninjured , he found two of his comrades dea  --  nd farther away his friend Messmann , whom he had known from the time when both began to walk , with whom he had played , gone to school , from whom he had been inseparabl  --  ying there with his belly torn open , his intestines coming outThey carried him on a tent litter to the field hospital , by the nearestpath through a cornfield up a slope . Four men carried him , one at each corner , and he was lying in the brown tent litter , his hands pressed against the white , fat , bloody intestines , his mouth open , his eyes uncomprehendingly fixed ... . Two hours later he died . For one of them he had screamed . Ravic remembered how they had returned . He had sat in the barracks , dull and bewildered . It was the first time he had seen anything like that . Katezinsky had found him there , the group leader , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said . " They have beer and whisky in the Bavarian canteen today . Sausages too . " Ravic had stared at him . He could not understand such callousness . Katezinsky had watched him for a while . Then he had said , " You are coming with me . Even if I have to beat you up . To-96T R I U M P Hday you 'll eat and get drunk and go to a cat-house . " He had not answered . Katczinsky had sat down beside him . " I know what 's the matter with you . I know too what you think of me now . But I have been here two years and you two weeks . Listen ! Can anything still be done for Messmann ? " ? " No . " ? " Do n't you know that we would risk everything if there were a chance to save him ? " He had looked up . Yes . He knew that . He knew that about Katczinsky . " Well . He is dead . There is nothing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get out of here for the front . This time it wo n't be so quiet there . Crouching here now and thinking of Messmann , the thing eats into you . Ruins your nerves . Makes you jittery . Perhapsjust enough to slow you down during the next attack out there . Just half a second late . Then we carry you back as we did Messmann . Whom does it help ? Messmann ? No . Someone else ? No . It kills you , that 's all . Now do you understand ? " ? " Yes , but I ca n't . " ? " Shut up , you can ! Others could too . You are n't the first . " It had become better after that night . He had gone with him ; he had learned his first lesson . Help when you can ; do everything the  --  ut when you can no longer do anything , forget it ! Turn away ! Pull yourself together . Compassion is meant for quiet times . Not when life is at stake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need it . Mourning is one thing , facts are another . One does n't mourn less when one sees the facts and accepts them . That is how one survives . Ravic drank his cognac . The Frenchmen at the next table were still talking about their government . About France 's failure . About England . About Italy . About Chamberlain . Words , words . The only ones who did something were the others . They were not stronger , only more determined . They were not braver , they only knew that the others would n't fight . Postponemen  --  ut what did they do with it ? Did they arm themselves , did they make up for lost time , did they pull themselves together ? They watched the others going ahead arming themselve  --  nd waited , passively hoping for a new postponement . The story of the herd of seals . Hundreds of them on a beach ; among them the hunter killing one after the other with a club . Together they could easily have crushed hi  --  ut they lay there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was97only killing a neighbo  --  ne neighbor after the other . The story of the European seals . The sunset of civilization . Tired shapeless Gotterdammerung . The empty banners of human rights . The sell-out of a continent . The onrushing deluge . The haggling for the last prices . The old dance of despair on the volcano . Peoples again slowly being driven into a slaughterhouse . The fleas would save themselves when the sheep were being sacrificed . As always . Ravic pressed out his cigarette . He looked around . What did it all mean ? Had n't the evening been like a dove before , like a soft gray dove ? Bury the dead and devour life . Time is short . To survive was everything . A time would come when one was needed . One should keep oneself whole and ready for that . He called the waiter and paid . The lights in the Scheherazade were lowered when he entered . The gypsies were playing and the spotlight flooded the table beside the orchestra where Joan Madou sat . Ravic stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moved a table into position . But Ravic remained stand- ing and looked at Joan Madou . " Vodka ? " the waiter asked . " Yes . A carafe . " Ravic sat down . He poured vodka into his glass and drank it quickly . He wanted to get rid of the thoughts he had had outside . The grimace of the past and the grimace of deat  --  belly torn open by shells and one eaten up by cancer . He noticed that he was sitting at the same table where he had sat with Kate Hegstroem two days before . Another table was vacated beside him . He did not move there . It made no difference . Whether he was sitting at this table or at the nex  --  t did not help Kate Hegstroem . What had Veber said once ? Why do you get upset when an operation is hope- less ? You do what you can and you go home , otherwise where would it lead ? Yes , where would it lead ? He heard Joan Madou 's voice coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agitating voice . He reached for the carafe with the limpid brandy . One of those moments when colors fade and life turns gray under powerless hands . The mystic ebb . The silent caesura 98 ihbetween breaths . The bite of time slowly consuming one 's heart . Santa Lucia Luntana , sang the voice by the orchestra . It came to him as though across an ocea  --  rom a forgotten far shore where something bloomed . " How do you like her ? " " Whom ? " Ravic glanced up . The manager stood at his side . He motioned to Joan Madou . " Much . Very much . " " She is n't exactly a sensation . But quite good between the other numbers . " The manager moved along . For a moment his pointed beard stood out black against the white light . Then he disappeared in the darkness . The spotlight died away . The orchestra began to play a tango . The illuminated table plates emerged again and above them the blurred faces . Joan Madou rose and made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times because couples were going to the dance floor . Ravic looked at her and she looked at hirn . Her face betrayed no surprise . She came straight toward him . He got up and pushed the table aside . A waiter came to his aid . " Thanks , " he said . " I 'll do it myself . All we need is another glass . " He moved the table back again and filled the glass which the waiter had brought . " Here , this is vodka , " he said . " I do n't know whether you drink that . " " Yes . We have drunk it before . In the Belle Aurore . " " That 's right . " We were here before too , he thought . Ages ago . Three weeks ago . Then you were sitting here in your raincoat , huddled , nothing but a bit of misery and defeat in the half-dark . Now ? " Salute , " he said . A gleam crossed her face . She did not smile ; only her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time , " she said . " Salute . " He emptied his glass and looked at her . The high brows , the wide-set eyes , the mout  --  ll that had formerly been blurred and separate , without context , now combined to shape a bright , mysteriousfac  --  face whose openness was its secret . It neither hid99nor revealed anything . It promised nothing and thereby every- thing . Odd , I have n't seen this before , he thought . But perhaps it was not there . Perhaps it was then completely filled with confusion and fear . " Have you a cigarette ? " Joan Madou asked . " Only the Algerians . Those with the strong black tobacco . " Ravic was about to call the waiter . " They are not too strong , " Joan Madou said . " Once you gave me one . On the Pont de l'Alma . " " That 's true . " It is true and it is n't true , he thought . That was a pale , hunted creature , not you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly none of them is true any longer . " I was here once before , " he said . " Day before yesterday . " " I know . I saw you . " She did n't ask about Kate Hegstroem . She sat in the corner , calm and relaxed , and smoked , and was completely absorbed in her smoking . Then she drank , calmly and slowly , and was completely absorbed in her drinking . She seemed to do everything she did wholly , however unimportant it was . At that time she was com- pletely desperate too , Ravic though  --  nd now she was n't at all any more . Suddenly she had warmth and a self-evident , assured placidity . He did not know whether it was due to the fact that nothing moved her life at the momen  --  e only felt it shine un- premeditatedly upon him . The carafe of vodka was empty . " Shall we go on drinking the same ? " " What was it you gave me to drink then ? " " When ? Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , not here . That first evening . " Ravic reflected . " I ca n't remember any more . Was n't it cognac ? " " No . It looked like cognac but it was something else . I tried to get it . But I could n't . " " Why do you want it ? Was it so good ? " " Not because of that . It was the warmest thing I ever drank in my life . " " Where did we drink it ? " 100T R I U M P H " In a small bistro near the Arc . We had to go down a few steps . Cabdrivers and a few girls were there . The waiter had a woman tattooed on his arm . " " Now I know . It must have been calvados . Apple brandy from Normandy . Have you tried that ? " " I do n't think so . " Ravic called the waiter . " Have you any calvados ? " " No . Sorry . No one ever asks for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It must have been calvados . It 's a shame we ca n't find out . The simplest thing would be to go to that place again . But that 's not possible now . " " Why ? " " Do n't you have to stay here ? " " No . I 'm through . " " Fine . Do you want to go there ? " " Yes . " Ravic had no trouble finding the bistro . It was fairly empty . The waiter with the woman tattooed on his arm glanced at each of them in turn ; then he shuffled out from behind his counter and wiped a table . " This is progress , " Ravic said . " he did n't do that then . " " Not this table , " Joan Madou said . " That one , there . " Ravic smiled . " Are you superstitious ? " " Sometimes . " The waiter stood beside them . " That 's it , " he said , making the tattooing jump . " That 's where you sat last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perfectly . " " " You should be a general , " Ravic said . " With such a memory . " " I never forget anything . " " Then I wonder how you can live . But do you also remember what we drank last time ? " " Calvados , " the waiter said without hesitating . " Right . We 'd like to repeat it now . " Ravic turned to Joan Madou . " How simply problems are solved sometimes . Now we 'll see if it tastes just the same . ' 101A R C H 0 FThe waiter brought the glasses . " Double . You ordered double calvados then . " " You 're gradually giving me an uncanny feeling , my good man . Do you also remember how we were dressed ? " " Raincoats . The lady wore a Basque beret . " " It 's a pity you have to be here . You belong in vaudeville . " " I used to be , " the waiter replied , astonished . " Circus . I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's disgraceful , but I did . " " This gentleman has a bad memory , " Joan Madou said to the waiter . " He is an expert in forgetting just as you are an expert in not forgetting . " Ravic glanced up . She looked at him . He smiled . " Perhaps not , after all , " he said . " And now we 'll taste the calvados . Salute ! " " Salute ! " The waiter remained standing . " What one forgets one misses later in life , sir , " he declared . The topic was not yet exhausted as far as he was concerned . " Correct . And what one does n't forget makes one 's life a hell . " " Not mine . It 's gone . Then how can it make one 's life a hell ? " Ravic glanced up . " Just because of it , brother . But you 're a happy man , not just an artist . Is it the same calvados ? " he asked Joan Madou . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a warmth rising in him . He knew what she meant ; but it was disarming that she said it . She did not seem to be concerned with what effect it might have . She sat in this bare-looking place as if she were all by herself . The light from the unshaded electric bulbs was merciless . Under them , two whores sittinga few tables away looked like their own grandmothers . But the glare had no effect on her . What had shone before in the subduedlight of the night club held its own here too . The cool bright face which did n't ask for anything , which simply existed , waitin  --  t was an empty face , he thought ; a face that could change with any wind of expression . One could dream into it anything . It was like a beautiful empty house waiting for carpets102T R I U M P Hand pictures . It had all possibilitie  --  t could become a palace or a brothel . It depended on the one who filled it . How limited by comparisonwas all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptied her glass . " My respects , " he said . " That was a double calvados . Do you want another one ? " " Yes . If you have time . " Why should n't I have time ? he thought . Then it occurred to him that she had seen him with Kate Hegstroem last time . He looked up . Her face did n't betray anything . " I have time , " he said . " I have to operate tomorrow at nine , that 's all . " " Can you do it if you stay up so late ? " " Yes . This has nothing to do with it . It 's habit . Nor do I operate every day . " The waiter refilled their glasses . He brought a package of cigaretteswith the bottle and put it on the table . It was a package of Laurens green . " These are what you had last time , are n't they ? " he asked Ravic triumphantly . " I have no idea . You know more than I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Joan Madou said . " It was Laurens green . " " You see ! The lady has a better memory than you have , sir . " " That 's yet to be proved . Anyway , we can use the cigarettes . " Ravic opened the package and held it out to her . " Do you stilllive in the same hotel ? " he asked . " Yes . Only I took a larger room . " A few cabdrivers entered . They sat down at one of the near-by tables and began a loud discussion . " Would you like to leave ? " Ravic asked . She nodded . He called the waiter and paid . " Are you sure you do n't have ' to go back to the Scheherazade ? " " No . " He took her coat . She did not put it on . She simply hung it around her shoulders . It was an inexpensive mink , possibly an imitatio  --  utit did not look cheap on her . Only what is not worn with assurance is cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now I 'll take you to your hotel , " he said when they stood out- side the entrance in the light drizzle . She turned toward him slowly . " Are n't we going to your place ? " Her face was just below his , partly turned up to him . The light from the lamp in front of the door shone full on it . Fine beads of moisture glittered on her hair . " Yes , " he said . A taxi approached and stopped . The driver waited awhile . Then he clicked his tongue , the gears grated , and he drove away . " I 've been waiting for you . Did you know ? " she asked . " No . " Her eyes gleamed in the light from the street lamp ; one could look through them and see no end . " I 've seen you today for the first time , " he said . " You are not the same woman as before . " " No . " " And all that was before never happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt the light ebb and flow of her breath . Invisibly and tenderly , it was vibrating toward him , without heaviness , ready and full of confidence  --  strange life in a strange night . Suddenly he felt his blood . It mounted and mounted and it was more than that : life , a thousand times cursed and welcomed , often lost and rewo  --  n hour ago still a barren landscape , arid , full of rocks , and without consolatio  --  nd now gushing , gushing as if from many fountains , resounding and close to the mysterious moment in which one had not believed any mor  --  ne was the first man again , on the shore of the ocean and out of the waves emerged , white and radiant , question and answer in one , it mounted and mounted , and the storm began above his eyes . " Hold me , " she said . He looked down into her face and put his arm around her . Her shoulders came closer to him like a ship coming to anchor in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Yes . " Her hands lay close together against his chest . " I 'll hold you , " he said . She nodded . 104 Another taxi came to a squeaking stop beside the curb . The driver , unmoved , looked over at them . On his shoulder sat a little dog in a knitted vest . " Taxi ? " he croaked from behind a long flaxen mustache . " Look , " Ravic said . " That man knows nothing . He does n't know that wings have touched us . He looks at us and does n't see that we have changed . That is the crazy thing about the world : you may turn into an archangel , a fool or a crimina  --  o one will see it . But when a button is missin  --  veryone sees that . " " It is not crazy . It is good so . It leaves us to ourselves . " Ravic looked at her . U  --  e though  --  hat a word ! The most mysterious in the world . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lit a cigarette . " Come , " Ravic said . " IIe wo n't let us go . He is experienced in his trade . " " I do n't want to ride . Let 's walk . " " It is beginning to rain . " " That is n't rain . That is mist . I do n't want a taxi . I want to walk with you . " " All right . But I 'd like to make that man understand that something has happened here . " Ravic walked over and spoke to the driver . The man smiled a beautiful smile , greeted Joan with a gesture that Frenchmen alone achieve at such moments , and drove away . " How did you explain it to him ? " she asked when Ravic returned . " With money . The simplest thing . Like all people who work nights he 's a cynic . He understood immediately . He was benevolentwith a touch of amiable contempt . " She smiled . He put his arm around her shoulders . She leaned against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , warm and soft and wide , something that drew him down as though with many hands , and made it suddenly unbearable that they were standing side by side on their feet , those small platforms , absurdly upright , balancing , instead of forgetting and sinking down , yieldingto the call of the skin , the call behind the millenniums when105there did not as yet exist brains and thoughts and suffering and doubt , but only the dark happiness of the blood " Come , " he said . They walked along the empty gray street through the light rain , and when they reached its end , the square lay before them again , huge and unbounded and , out of the flowing silver , suspended aloft , rose the massive grayness of the Are. 9Ravic returned to the hotel . Joan Madou had still been sleeping when he had left that morning . He had thought he would be back in an hour . It was now three hours later . " Hello , doctor , " someone said on the stairs . Ravic looked at the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , glasses . He did not recognize him . " Alvarez , " the man said . " Jaime Alvarez . Do n't you remember ? " Ravic shook his head . The man bent down and pulled up his trouser leg . A long scar ran along his shinbone up to his knee . " Do you remember now ? " " Did I operate on that ? " The man nodded . " On a kitchen table behind the front . In a temporary field hospital before Aranjuez . A little white cottage in an almond grove . Do you remember now ? " Suddenly Ravic scented the heavy aroma of almond blossoms . He smelled it as if it had ascended the dark staircase , sweet , putrid , inextricably mixed with the sweeter and more putrid scent of blood . " Yes , " he said . " I remember . " The wounded had been lying on the moonlit terrace , beside one another in rows . A few German and Italian planes had accomplishedthat . Children , women , peasants , torn by bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman torn open up to her breast ; an old man who anxiously held the fingers torn off one hand in his other hand because he thought they could be sewed on . Over all that the heavy night odor and the clear dew falling. 106107 " Is your leg quite all right again ? " Ravic asked . " Just about . I ca n't bend it completely . " The man smiled . " But it was good enough to get me across the Pyrenees . Gonzalez is dead . " Ravic no longer knew who Gonzalez was . But now he recalled a young student who had assisted him . " Do you know what happened to Manolo ? " " Imprisoned . Shot . " " And Serna ? The brigade commander ? " " Dead . Before Madrid . " The man smiled again . It was a rigid automatic smile that came suddenly and was without emotion . " Mura and La Pena were taken prisoners . Shot . " Ravic no longer knew who Mura and La Pena were . He had left Spain after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital disbanded . " Carnero , Orta , and Goldstein are in a concentration camp , " Alvarez said . " In France . Blatzky too is safe . Hidden across the frontier . " Ravic recalled only Goldstein . There had been too many faces at that time . " Do you live here in the hotel now ? " he asked . " Yes . We moved in yesterday . Over there . " The man pointed at the rooms on the second floor . " We were kept in the camp down at the frontier for a long time . Finally we were released . We still had some money . " He smiled again . " Beds . Real beds . A good hotel . Even pictures of our leaders on the walls . " " Yes , " Ravic said without irony . " It must be pleasant after all that over there . " He said goodbye to Alvarez and went to his room . The room had been cleaned and was empty . Joan had gone . He looked around . She had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang . After a while the maid came . " The lady left , " she said before he could ask her . " I see that myself . How did you know anyone was here ? " " But , Mr. Ravic , " the girl said without adding anything and with an expression as if her honor had been offended . " Did she have breakfast ? " " No . I have n't seen her . Otherwise I would have thought of it . I know that from before . " Ravic looked at her . He did not like the concluding sentence . He pulled a few francs out of his pocket and put them into the girl 's apron pocket . " All right , " he said . " Do the same next time . Bring breakfast only when I explicitly tell you to do so . And do n't come up to clean the room before you know for sure that it is empty . " The girl smiled understandingly . " Very well , Mr. Ravic . " He looked after her uneasily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was married and did not want to be seen . In former days he would have laughed about it . Now he did not like it . But why not ? he thought . He shrugged his shoulders and went to the window . Hotels were hotels . That could not be changed . He opened the window . A cloudy noon hung above the houses . Sparrows chirped in the eaves . On the floor below two voices squabbled . That would be the Goldberg family . The man was twenty years older than his wife . A wholesale corndealer from Breslau . His wife was having an affair with the refugee Wiesenhoff . She thought no one knew it . The only one who did not know it was Goldberg . Ravic closed the window . He had operated on a gall bladder that morning . An anonymous gall bladder for Durant . He had cut open for Durant part of an unknown male belly . A fee of two hundred francs . Afterwards he had gone to see Kate Hegstroem . She had a fever . Too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had slept restlessly . It was nothing alarming . But it would have been better if there had been no fever . He stared through the window . The strange empty feeling of afterwards . The bed that no longer had any meaning . The day that mercilessly tore yesterday into pieces like a jackal tearing the hide of an antelope . The woods of the night , miraculously grown in the dark , now endlessly remote again , merely a fata morgana in the wasteland of hours . . . . He turned around . On his table he found Lucienne Martinet 's address . She had been released from the hospital a short timeT R I U M P H " Brother , " Ravic said calmly , " you do n't look as if you would pay it . Besides , whether it will cost anything is a different matter . And now get out . " The boy grinned and sprawled his legs comfortably . He wore tapered patent leather shoes and violet socks . " Please , Bobo , " Lucienne said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bobo did not pay any attention to her . He stared at Ravic . " It suits me fine that you 're here , " he said . " Now I can put you straight right away . My dear man , if you think perhaps you can bleed us for hospital bills , operations , and all tha  --  othing doing ! We did n't ask to have her sent to the hospita  --  ot to mention the operatio  --  o it 's no go with the money angle . You ought to be glad we do n't ask for compensation ! For an unauthorized operation . " He showed a row of stained teeth . " That 's some surprise , is n't it ? Yes , sir , Bobo knows his way around ; he ca n't be easily gypped . " The boy looked very much contented . He felt he had got out of that brilliantly . Lucienne became pale . She looked anxiously from Bobo to Ravic . " You understand ? " Bobo asked triumphantly . " Was he the one ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So that 's it , " he said and studied Bobo . A tall thin fellow with a rayon scarf around his skinny throat , in which the Adam 's apple was moving up and down . Drooping shoulders , too long a nose , a degenerate chi  --  he picture-book conception of a suburb pimp . " So what 's it ? " Bobo asked , challenging . " I think I 've told you often enough now to get going . I want to examine her . " " Merle , " Bobo replied . Slowly Ravic walked toward him . He had had enough of Bobo . The boy jumped up , stepped back , and suddenly had a thin rope of about two yards ' length in his hands . Ravic knew what he intended to do with it . When Ravic came closer he was going to jump aside , then get swiftly behind him and slip the rope over his head so that he could strangle him from behind . It would work if the other person did not know about it or attempted to box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given them no peace until they released her . Two days ago he had been with her . It was not necessary to look her up again ; but he had nothing else to do and decided to go there . The house was in the Rue Clavel . Downstairs was a butcher 's shop in which a strong woman was swinging a cleaver and selling meat . She was in mourning . Her husband had died two weeks before . Now the woman reigned in the shop , with a helper . Ravic saw her as he passed by . She was apparently about to go calling . She wore a hat with a long black crepe veil and was quickly choppingoff a pig 's leg to oblige an acquaintance . The veil waved above the open carcass , the cleaver glittered and came crashing down . " With one blow , " the widow said in a satisfied tone and flung the leg on the scale . Lucienne lived in a small room on the top floor . She was not alone . A fellow of about twenty-five slouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was smoking a homemade cigarette which stuck to his upper lip when he talked . He remained sitting as Ravie entered . Lucienne lay in bed . She was bewildered and blushed . " Doctor ? I did n't know you would come today . " She looked at the young man . " This is ? " " Someone , " the boy interrupted her gruffly . " It is n't necessary to toss names around . " He leaned back . " So you are the doctor ! " " How are you , Lucienne ? " Ravic asked without taking any notice of him . " You 're wise to stay in bed . " " She could have been up long ago , " the boy declared . " There 's no longer anything wrong with her . When she does n't work it runs up expenses . Ravic turned around and looked at him . " Leave us alone , " he said . " What ? " " Get out . Out of the room . I 'm going to examine Lucienne . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that just as well with me here . We are n't so fine . And why examine ? You were here only the day before yesterday . That costs for an extra visit , eh ? " T R I U M P H " The landlady . But she too has started to grumble . " " Someone else ? " " No . Before there was Marie . She is dead . " Ravic took stock of the room . It was poorly furnished and clean . A few fuchsias stood in the window . " And Bobo ? " he said . " Well , he appeared again after everything was over ? " Lucienne did not answer . " Why do n't you throw him out ? " " He is n't so bad , doctor . Only wild ? " Ravic looked at her . Love , he thought . That too is love . The old miracle . It not only casts a rainbow of dreams against the gray sky of fact  --  t also sheds romantic light upon a heap of dun  --  miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of having become , in a remote way , an accomplice . " All right , Lucienne , " he said . " Do n't worry about it . First become healthy . " Relieved , she nodded . " And that about the money , " she blurted out , embarrassed , " that is n't true . He only said so . I 'll pay everything . Everything . In installments . When will I be able to work again ? " " In about two weeks , if you 're not foolish . And nothing with Bobo ! Absolutely nothing , Lucienne ! Otherwise you might die , you understand ? " " Yes , " she replied without conviction . Ravic covered her slender body with the blanket . When he looked up he noticed that she was weeping . " Could n't it be sooner ? " she said . " I can sit while I work . I must ? " " Perhaps . We 'll see . It depends on how well you take care of yourself . You should tell me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He saw the defense in her eyes . " I wo n't go to the police , " he said . " Certainly not . I 'll only try to get the money back you paid her . Then you could be calmer . How much was it ? " " Three hundred francs . You 'll never get it from her . " " One can try . What 's her name and where does she live ? You 'll never need her again , Lucienne . You can no longer have any children . And she ca n't do anything to you . " 112 113A R C H 0 F " Bobo , " Lucienne called . " Bobo , do n't ! " " You young scum ! " Ravic said . " That miserable old rope trick ? do n't you know any better ? " He laughed . Bobo was nonplused for a moment . His eyes became uncertain . In an instant Ravic had ripped his jacket down over his shoulders with both hands so that he could not lift his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ? " he said , quickly opened the door , and shoved the surprised and helpless fellow roughly out of the room . " If that 's the sort of thing you like , become a soldier , you would-be apache ! But do n't molest grown-up people . " He locked the door from inside . " So , Lucienne , " he said . " Now let 's have a look at you . " She trembled . " Calm , calm . It 's over . " He took the worn-out cotton quilt and put it on the chair . Then he rolled back the green blanket . " Pajamas . Why that ? They 're less comfortable . You should not move much yet , Lucienne . " She remained silent for a moment . " I only put them on today , " she said . " Have n't you got any nightgowns ? I can have two of them sent to you from the hospital . " " No , not because of that . I put them on because I knew ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would come . He said I was no longer sick . He would n't wait any longer . " " What ? It 's a pity I did n't know that before . " Ravic looked at the door angrily . " He 'll wait . " Lucienne had the very white skin of anemic women . The veins lay blue under the thin epidermis . She was well built , with delicate bones , slender , but nowhere too bony . One of the innumerable girls , Ravic thought , who make one wonder why nature puts on such a show of grac  --  ince one knows what will become of almost all of the  --  verworked drudges who soon lose their figures through wrong and unhealthy ways of life . " You will have to stay in bed pretty much for another week , Lucienne . You may get up and walk around here . But be careful ; do n't lift anything . And do n't climb any stairs for the next few days . Have you got someone to take care of you ? Besides this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated . " There in the drawer , " she said then . " At your right in the drawer . " " This slip here ? " " Yes . " " All right . I 'll go there one of the next few days . Do n't be afraid . " Ravic put on his coat . " What 's the matter ? " he asked . " Why do you want to get up ? " " Bobo . You do n't know him . " He smiled . " I think I know worse than him . Stay right in bed . To judge by what I have seen we need not be concerned . So long , Lucienne . I 'll drop in on you soon again . " Ravic turned the key and the latch simultaneously , and quickly opened the door . No one stood in the corridor . Nor had he expectedit ; he knew Bobo 's type . Downstairs the assistant was now standing in the butcher 's shop , a man with a sallow face and without the ardor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death he had become noticeably more tired . His chances of marrying his master 's wife were small . A brushmaker in the bistro opposite announcedthis in a loud voice and also that she would drive him too into the grave before that happened . The assistant had already lost much weight , he said . But the widow had blossomed mightily . Ravic drank a cassis and paid . He had expected to find Bobo in the bistro ; but Bobo was not there . Joan Madou quickly left the Scheherazade . She opened the door of the taxi in which Ravic was waiting . " Come , " she said . " Let 's get away from here . Let 's go to your place . " " Has something happened ? " " No . Nothing . It 's just that I 've had enough of night-club life . " " Just a moment . " Ravic called to the woman who stood before the entrance , selling flowers . " Granny , " he said . " Let me have all your roses . How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sixty francs . For you . Because you gave me that prescription for my rheumatism . " " Did it help ? " " No . How can it , as long as I have to stand in the wet at night ? " 114T R I U M P H " You 're the most sensible patient I ever met in my life . " He took the roses . " Here is my apology for having left you to wake up alone this morning , " he said to Joan and put the flowers on the floor of the taxi . " Would you like to have a drink some-where ? " " No . I 'd like to go to your place . Put the flowers here on the seat . Not on the floor . " " They are all right down there . One should love flowers , but not make too much fuss about them . " She turned her head quickly . " You mean one should n't spoil what one loves ? " " No . I only mean that one should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is better if there are no flowers between us . " Joan looked at him doubtfully for a moment . Then her face brightened . " Do you know what I did today ? I lived . Lived again . I breathed . Breathed again . I existed . Existed again . For the first time . I had hands again . And eyes and a mouth . " The driver maneuvered the taxi out from among the other cars in the small street . Then he started with a jerk . The jolt threw Joan toward Ravic . He held her in his arms for a moment and felt her closeness . It was like a warm wind as if she were melting away the crust of the day , the strange defensive coolness within him , while she sat there and spoke , carried away by her feelings and by herself . " The whole da  --  t threw itself over my neck and against my breast as though to make me grow green and put out leaves and blossom  --  t held me and held me and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nd you ? " Ravic looked at her . She sat leaning forward 9n the dirty leather seat and her shoulders shone out of her black evening gown . She was open and outspoken and without shame , she said what she felt and he found himself poor and dry in comparison . I was performing operations , he thought . I forgot you . I was with Lucienne . I was somewhere in the past . Without you . Then when the evening came a certain warmth came slowly with it . I was not with you . I thought of Kate Hegstroem . " Joan , " he said and put his hands on her hands , which she had115rested on the seat . " We ca n't go to my place now , I 've got to go first to the hospital . Only for a few minutes . " " Have you got to look after the woman you operated on ? " " Not the one of this morning . Someone else . Would you like to wait somewhere for me ? " " Must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't want to be called later . " I can wait for you . Have we enough time to go by your hotel ? " " Yes . " " Let 's go there first . Then you 'll come later . I can wait for you . " " All right . " Ravic gave the driver his address . He leaned back and felt the top of the seat against his neck . His hands were still on Joan 's hands . He felt that she was waiting for him to say something . Something about him and her . But he could not . She had already said too much . It was not so much , he thought . The cab stopped . " You go on , " Joan said . " I 'll manage here all right . I 'm not afraid . Just give me your key . " " The key is in the hotel . " " I 'll have them give it to me . I 've got to learn to do that . " She took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves me while I sleep and comes again when I do n't expect i  --  here are many things I 'll have to learn . Let me start right away . " " I 'll come up with you . We wo n't overdo anything . It 's bad enough to have to leave you alone again immediately . " She laughed . She looked very young . " Please wait a moment , " Ravic said to the driver . The man slowly closed one eye . " Even longer . " " Let me have the key , " Joan said as they walked upstairs . " Why ? " " Let me have it . " She opened the door . Then she stopped . " Beautiful , " she said into the dark room into which a bleak moon shone through the clouds outside the window . " Beautiful ? This hole ? " " Yes , beautiful ! Everything is beautiful . " " Maybe right now . Now it 's dark . But ? " Ravic reached for the switch. 116 " Do n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And do n't wait till tomorrownoon to come back . " She stood in the doorway in the dark . The silver light from the window was behind her shoulders and her head . She was indistinct and exciting and mysterious . Her coat had slipped down ; it lay at her feet like a heap of black foam . She leaned against the doorframeand one of her arms caught a long shaft of light from the corridor . " Go and come again , " she said and closed the door . Kate Hegstroem 's fever had gone down . " Has she been awake ? " Ravic asked the drowsy nurse . " Yes . At eleven . She asked for you . I told her what you instructed me to say . " " Did she say anything about the bandages ? " " Yes . I told her you had to make an incision . A light operation . You 'd explain it to her tomorrow . " " That was all ? " " Yes . She said everything was all right as long as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regards if you came again tonight and tell you that she has confidence in you . " " So ? " Ravic stood awhile and looked down at the nurse 's parted black hair . " How old are you ? " he asked . She raised her head in astonishment . " Twenty-three . " " Twenty-three . And how long have you been nursing ? " " For the last two and a half years . In January it was two and a half years . " " Do you like your profession ? " The nurse smiled all over her apple face . " I like it very much , " she declared chattily . " Of course some of the patients are trying , but most of them are nice . Madame Brissot gave me a beautiful , almost new silk dress as a present yesterday . And last week I got a pair of patent leather shoes from Madame Lerner . The one who later died at home . " She smiled again . " I hardly have to buy any clothing . I almost always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange it with a friend of mine who has a shop . That 's why I 'm well off . Madame Hegstroem too is always very generous . She gives me117A R C H 0 Fmoney . Last time it was a hundred francs . For only twelve days . How long will she be here this time , doctor ? " " Longer . A few weeks . " The nurse looked happy . Behind her clear unlined forehead she was calculating how much she would get . Ravic bent over Kate Hegstroem once more . She was breathing quietly . The slight odor from the wound mingled with the dry perfume of her hair . Suddenlyhe could not stand it . She had confidence in him . Confidence . The flat cut-up abdomen in which the beast was feeding . Sewn up without the possibility of doing anything . Confidence . " Good night , nurse , " he said . " Good night , doctor . " The chubby nurse sat down in the chair in a corner of the room . She dimmed the light on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket , and reached for a magazine . It was one of those cheap magazines containing detective stories and movie pictures . She adjusted herself comfortably and began to read . Beside her on a little table she had put an opened box of chocolate wafers . Ravic saw her take one without looking up . Sometimes one does n't comprehendthe simplest things , he though  --  hat in the same room one person should be lying deadly ill and the other not at all concerned about it . He closed the door . But is n't it the same with me ? Am I not going from , this room into another in whichThe room was dark . The door to the bathroom was ajar . There was a light beyond it . Ravic hesitated . He did not know whether Joan was still in the bathroom . Then he heard her breathing . He walked through the room to the bathroom . He did not say anything . He knew she was here and was not asleep , but she too said nothing . Suddenly the room was full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently calle  --  n unknown abyss , beyond thought , from which rose the poppy clouds and the dizzinessof a red tumult . He closed the door of the bathroom . In the clear light of the white bulbs everything was familiar and known to him again . He turned on the taps of the shower . It was the only shower in the hotel . Ravic had paid for it himself and had had it installed . He118T R I U M P Hknew that in his absence it was still being shown to the patron 's French relatives and friends as a remarkable sight . The hot water ran down his skin . In the next room Joan Madou was lying and waiting for him . Her skin was smooth , her hair surged over the pillow like an impetuous wave , and her eyes shone lucidly even when the room was dark , as if they caught the meager light of winter stars from outside the window and reflected it . She lay there , subtle and changeable and exciting because there was nothing left of the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that enticement and temptation could give without lov  --  nd yet all of a sudden he felt something like an aversion to he  --  strange resistance mixed with a violent and sudden attraction . He looked around involuntaril  --  f the bathroom had had a second exit , he thought it possible that he would have dressed and gone out to drink . He dried himself and hesitated for a while . Strange , what had fluttered in from nowhere ! A shadow , a nothing . Perhaps it was because he had been with Kate Iegstroem . Or because of what Joan had said in the taxi earlier . Much too quick and much too easy . Or simply because someone was waitin  --  nstead of his waiting . He tightened his lips and opened the door . " Ravic , " Joan said out of the dark . " The calvados is on the table by the window . " - He stood still . He realized that he had been tense . He could not have stood many things she might have said . This one was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did you find the bottle ? " he asked . " That was easy . It was standing right here . But I opened it . I discovered a corkscrew somewhere among your things . Give me another glass . " He poured two glasses and brought one to her . " Here ? " It was good to feel the clear apple brandy . It was good that Joan had found the right word . She leaned her head back and drank . Her hair fell over her shoulders and in this moment she seemed to be nothing but drinking . Ravic had noticed this in her before . She gave herself completely to whatever she did . It occurred to him vaguely that therein119lay not only fascination , but also danger . Such women were nothing but drinking , when they drank ; nothing but love when they loved ; nothing but desperation when they were desperate ; and nothing but forgetfulness when they forgot . Joan put down the glass and laughed suddenly . " Ravic , " she said . " I know what you are thinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already half married just now . So did I. To be abandoned at the door is not exactly an enviable experience . Left alone with roses in one 's arms . Thank God , the calvados was here . Do n't be so careful with the bottle . " Ravic refilled her glass . " You are a wonderful person , " he said . " It 's true . There in the bathroom I could hardly stand you . Now I find you wonderful . Salute ! " " Salute . " He drank his calvados . " It is the second night , " he said . " The dangerous night . The charm of the unknown is gone and the charm of familiarity has not yet come . We 'll survive it . " Joan put her glass down . " You seem to know quite a lot about it . " " I know nothing at all . I just talk . One never knows anything . Everything is always different . Now too . It never is the second night . It is always the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank God ! Otherwise where would it lead ? Into something like arithmetic . And now come . I do n't want to go to sleep yet . I want to drink with you . The stars stand naked up there in the cold . How easily one can freeze when one is alone ! Even when it is hot . Never when there are two . " " Two together can actually freeze to death . " " Not we . " " Naturally not , " Ravic said and in the dark she did not see the expression that crossed his face . " Not we . " 12010 " What was the matter with me , Ravic ? " Kate Hegstroem asked . She was lying in her bed , slightly raised , with two pillows under her head . The room had the odor of Eau de Sante and perfume . The window was slightly opened at the top . Clear , somewhat chilly air streamed in from the outside and mingled with the warmth of the room as if it were not January but already April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days . Then you slept . Almost twenty-four hours . Now the fever has gone and everything is fine . How are you feeling ? " " Tired . Still always tired . But different from before . Not so tense any more . I have hardly any pain . " " You will have some later . Not very much , and we 'll take care of it so you 'll be able to stand it . But it wo n't stay the way it is now . You know that yourself ? " She nodded . " You have cut me up , Ravic ? " " Yes , Kate . " " Was it necessary ? " " Yes . " He waited . It was better to let her ask . " How long will I have to be in bed ? " " A few weeks . " She remained silent for a while . " I think it will be good for me . I need quiet . I 'd had enough . I realize it now . I was tired . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to do with it ? " " Certainly . Most certainly . " " Also the fact that I had hemorrhages from time to time ? Betweenperiods ? " 121A R C H O F " That too , Kate . " " Then it 's a good thing that I have time . Maybe it was necessary . To have to get up now and face all that agai  --  do n't think I could do it . " " You do n't have to . Forget about it . Think only of the very next thing . For instance , of your breakfast . " " All right . " She smiled faintly . " Then pass me the mirror . " He gave her the hand mirror from the night table . She studied herself attentively in it . " Are these flowers from you , Ravic ? " " No . From the hospital . " She put the mirror on the bed . " Hospitals do n't send lilacs in January . Hospitals send asters or something like that . Neither do hospitals know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Here you are a veteran , Kate . " Ravic got up . " I have to go now . I 'll come back about six o'clock to look after you . " " Ravic ? " " Yes . " He turned around . Now it will come , he thought . Now she will ask . She extended her hand . " Thanks , " she said . " Thanks for the flowers . And thanks for looking out for me . I always feel safe with you . " " All right , Kate . All right . There was nothing really to look out for . And now fall asleep again if you can . In case you should have pains call the nurse . I 'll see that you get medicine . This afternoon I 'll be back . " " Veber , where is the brandy ? " " Was it as bad as that ? Here 's the bottle . Eugenie , get us aglass . " Eugenie reluctantly went for a glass . " That 's a thimble , " Veber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait , it might break your hand , I 'll do it myself . " " I do n't know why it is , Doctor Veber , " Eugenie declared bitingly , " whenever Mr. Ravic comes in , you ? " T R I U M P H " All right , all right , " Veber interrupted her . He poured a glass of cognac . " Here , Ravic . What does she believe ? " " She does not ask anything , " Ravic said . " She trusts me without asking questions . " Veber glanced up . " You see , " he replied triumphantly . " I told you so . " Ravic emptied his glass . " Has a patient ever expressed his thanks to you when you could n't do anything for him ? " " Often . " " And believed everything ? " " Naturally . " " And how did you feel about it ? " " Relieved , " Veber said in astonishment . " Very much relieved . " " I feel like vomiting . Like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside again . " Like vomiting , " Ravic repeated . " That 's the first human feeling I ever discovered in you , " Eugeniesaid . " Except , naturally , for the way you express yourself . " " You are not a discoverer , you are a nurse , Eugenie , you oftenforget that , " Veber declared . " The affair is settled , Ravic , is n't it ? " " Yes . For the time being . " " All right . She told the nurse this morning that she wants to go to Florence as soon as she leaves the hospital . Then we 're in the clear . " Veber rubbed his hands . " The doctors over there can take care of it then . I do n't like it when someone dies here . It always hurts the reputation . " Ravic rang the bell at the apartment door of the midwife who performed the abortion for Lucienne . After some time a sinisterlookingman opened . He kept the latch in his hand when he saw Ravic . " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak to Madame Boucher . " " She has no time . " " That does n't matter . I 'll wait awhile . " The man was about to close the door . " If I ca n't wait I 'll be back in a quarter of an hour , " Ravic said . " But not alone . With someone who will certainly be able to see her . " 122 123A R C H O FThe man stared at him . " What does that mean ? What do you want ? " " I told you . I want to speak to Madame Boucher . " The man pondered . " Wait , " he said and then closed the door . Ravic studied the peeling brown paint on the door , the tin letter box and the round enameled label with the name . A great deal of misery and fear had passed through this door . A few senseless laws which forced so many lives into the hands of quacks instead of doctors . No more children were born because of it . Whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no law . The only differencewas that the lives of some thousands of mothers were ruined every year . The door was opened again . " Are you from the police ? " the unshaven man asked . " If I were from the police I would n't be waiting here . " " Come in . " The man showed Ravic through a dark corridor into a room crowded with furniture . A plush sofa and a number of gilt chairs , an imitation Aubusson carpet , walnut Vertikows and pastoral prints on the walls . In front of the window stood a metal stand with a bird cage and a canary in it . Wherever there was any space there were chinaware and plaster figurines . Madame Boucher came in . She was enormously fat and wore a kind of billowing kimono which was not quite clean . She was a monster , but her face was smooth and pretty , with the exception of her eyes , which darted restlessly . " Monsieur ? " she asked in a businessliketone and remained standing . Ravic got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You performed an abortion for her . " " Nonsense ! " the woman replied immediately with complete calm . " I do n't know any Lucienne Martinet and I do n't perform abortions . You must be mistaken or someone has told you a lie . " She acted as if the affair were settled and was about to leave . But she did n't go . Ravic waited . She turned around . " Something else ? " " The abortion was a failure . The girl had serious hemorrhages1,2.ET R I U M P Hand almost died . She had to have an operation . I operated on her . " " It 's a lie ! " Madame Boucher suddenly hissed . " It 's a lie ! Those rats ! They fool around trying to fix themselves up and then get other people into trouble ! But I 'll show her ! Those rats ! My lawyer will settle that . I am well known and a taxpayer and I 'll see whether such an impudent little slut that whores around ? " Ravic studied her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outburst . It remained smooth and prett  --  er mouth only was drawn in and spat like a machine gun . " The girl wants very little , " he interrupted the woman . " She only wants back the money she paid you . " Madame Boucher laughed . " Money ? Pay back ? When did I get any from her ? Has she a receipt ? " " Naturally not . You would n't give any receipts . " " Because I 've never seen her ! And would anyone believe her ? " " Yes . She has witnesses . She was operated on in Doctor Veber 's hospital . The diagnosis was clear . A report exists about it . " " You may have a thousand reports ! Where does it say that I touched her ? Hospital ! Doctor Veber ! It 's a scream ! Such a rat goes to an elegant hospital ! Have n't you got anything else to do ? " " I have . Listen . The girl paid you three hundred francs . She can sue you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man entered . " Something wrong , Adele ? " " No . Sue for compensation ? If she goes to court she herself will be sentenced . First of all she , that 's certain because she admits that an abortion was done for her . That I did it still has to be proved . That she ca n't . " The sinister man bleated . " Quiet , Roger , " Madame Boucher said . " You may go . " " Brunier is outside . " " All right . Tell him to wait . You know ? " The man nodded and left . With him went a strong smell of cognac . Ravic sniffed . " That 's an old cognac , " he said . " At least thirty , forty years old . Lucky man who drinks something like that early in the afternoon . " 125Madame Boucher stared at him for a moment , flabbergasted . Then she slowly drew in her lips . " That 's right . Do you want some ? " " Why not ? " In spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed and silentness . " Roger . " The sinister man came in . " You 've been drinking the good cognacagain ! Do n't lie , I smell it ! Bring the bottle ! Do n't talk , bring the bottle ! " Roger brought the bottle . " I gave Brunier some . He forced me to drink with him . " Madame Boucher did not answer . She closed the door and fetched a curved glass from the walnut Vertikow . Ravic looked at it with disgust . The head of a woman was engraved on it . Madame Boucher poured and put the glass in front of him on the tablecloth , which was adorned with peacocks . " You seem to be a sensibleperson , sir , " she said . Ravic could not deny her a certain respect . She was not of iron , as Lucienne had told him ; she was wors  --  f rubber . You could break iron . Not rubber . Her argument against collecting damages was sound . " Your operation was a failure , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for you to refund the money . " " Do you pay money back if a patient dies after an operation ? " " No . But sometimes we do n't take any money for an operation . For instance , from Lucienne . " Madame Boucher looked at him . " You se  --  hen why is she makingsuch a fuss ? She should be glad . " Ravic lifted his glass . " Madame , " he said , " my respects . One ca n't get the better of you . " The woman slowly put the bottle on the table . " Sir , many have already tried it . But you seem to be more sensible . Do you think this business is fun ? Or all the money mine ? The police get almost a hundred francs of those three hundred . Do you believe that I could work otherwise ? One of them is sitting outside now to get money . I have to bribe them , always bribe them ; there 's no other126T R I U M P Hway . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , and should you want to make use of it somehow , I 'd deny it and the police would pay no attention . You may believe that . " " I believe it . " Madame Boucher cast a quick look at him . When she saw that he did not mean it ironically , she moved a chair closer to him and sat down . She moved the chair like a feathe  --  eneath her fat she seemed to have enormous strength . She refilled his glass with the cognac reserved for bribes . " Three hundred francs looks like a good deal of mone  --  ut there are more expenses than just the police . The ren  --  aturally higher for me than for someone else ? laundry , instrument  --  or me twice as expensive as for physician  --  ommissions , bribe  --  must be on good terms with everyon  --  rinks , presents at New Year and on birthdays for the officials and their wive  --  hat 's something , sir ! Sometimes hardly anything is left . " " I do n't question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort of thing can happen that happened to Lucienne . " " Does it never happen with doctors ? " Madame Boucher asked quickly . " Not so often by far . " " Sir . " She straightened up . " I 'm honest . I tell every one of the girls who come here that something might happen . And none of them leaves . They beg me to do it . They cry and are desperate . They would commit suicide if I did n't help them . What scenes have been staged here ! They roll on the rug and entreat me ! Do you see the corner of that Vertikow there where the veneer is chipped off ? A well-to-do lady did that in her desperation . I took care of her . Do you want to see something ? Ten pounds of plum jam she sent yesterday are in the kitchen . Out of pure gratitude although she had paid . I 'll tell you something , sir ? " Madame Boucher 's voice rose and became fuller " ? you may call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She had got up . The kimono billowed around her majestically . The canary began to sing in his cage as if by command . Ravic got127A R C H 0 Fup . He had a feeling for melodrama . But he knew too that Madame Boucher did not exaggerate . " All right , " he said . " I 'll go now . For Lucienne you were n't exactly a benefactress . " " You should have seen her before ! What more does she want ? She 's health  --  he child is done wit  --  hat was all she wanted . And she does n't have to pay for the hospital . " " She 'll never be able to have a child again . " Madame Boucher hesitated a second only . " All the better , " she declared , unmoved . " Then she will be overjoyed , that little whore . " Ravic realized that there was nothing to be done . " Au revoir , madame , " he said . " It has been interesting here with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to avoid shaking hands with her . But that was not her intention . She lowered her voice in a confidential manner . " You are sensible , sir . More sensible than most doctors . It 's a pity that you ? " She hesitated and looked at him encouragingly . " Sometimes one needs for certain case  --  n understanding physician could then be of great help ? " Ravic did not object . He wanted to hear more . " It would not halm you , " Madame Boucher added . " Just in special cases ? " She studied him like a cat that pretends to love birds . " There are wellto-doclients among them sometime  --  aturally always payment in advance an  --  e are safe , completely safe from the polic  --  assume you could very well use a few hundred francs on the side ? " She tapped him on his shoulder . " A good-looking man like you ? " She seized the bottle with a broad smile . " Well , what do you think ? " " Thanks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . I ca n't stand much . " He refused with great reluctance , for the cognacwas excellent . The bottle had no label and certainly came from a first-class private cellar . " I 'll think the other matter over . I 'll come again sometime . I 'd like to see your instruments . Maybe I can give you some advice as far as they are concerned . " " I 'll show you my instruments when you come again . Then you 'll show me your papers . Confidence for confidence . " " You 've already shown me some confidence . " " Not the least . " Madame Boucher smiled . " I only made you a proposition which I can deny at any time . You 're not a French-128T R I U M P Hman , one can hear that , although you speak well . Nor do you look it . You 're probably a refugee . " She smiled more broadly and looked at him with cool eyes . " One would n't believe you and would be , at best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got . Outside in the hall sits a police official . If you want to , you can denounce me right away . You wo n't do it . But you can think over my proposition . You would n't give me your name and address , would you ? " " No , " Ravic said , feeling beaten . " I thought not . " Madame Boucher really looked like a huge well-fed cat now . " Au revoir , monsieur . Consider my offer . I 've often before thought of working with the assistance of a refugee doctor . " Ravic smiled . He knew why . A refugee doctor would be completelyat her mercy . If anything happened he would be guilty . " I 'll think it over , " he said . " Au revoir , madame . " Ile walked along the dark corridor . Behind one of the doors he heard someone moaning . He assumed that the rooms were arrangedlike small cabins with beds . The women would stay there before they tottered home . A slim man with a trimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He studied Ravic attentively . Roger sat at his side . He had another bottle of the old cognac on the table . He tried to hide it instinctively when he saw Ravic . Then he grinned and dropped his hand . " Bon soir , docteur , " he said and showed his stained teeth . It seemed he had been eavesdropping at the door . " Bon soir , Roger . " It seemed to Ravic appropriate to be intimate . This indestructible woman had almost changed him from an outspoken enemy into an accomplice within half an hour in there . And so it was actually a relief to be not too formal with Roger who , after all that , had something astonishingly human about him . Downstairs he met two girls . They were looking from door to door . " Sir , " one of them asked with determination , " does Madame Boucher live here in this house ? " Ravic hesitated . But what point was there in saying anything ? It would not help at all . They would go . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other directions . " On the third floor . There is a name plate on the door . " The luminous dial of his watch shone in the dark like a tiny imitationsun . It was five o'clock in the morning . Joan should have come at three . It was still possible that she would come . Also possible that she was too tired and had gone straight to her hotel . Ravic stretched out to go back to sleep . But he could not fall asleep . He lay awake for a long time and looked at the ceiling where the red band from the electric signs on the roof opposite ran at regular intervals . He felt empty and did not know why . It was as if the warmth of his body were slowly seeping through his skin , and as if his blood wanted to lean against something that was not there and that it fell and fell into a soft nothingness . He crossed his hands behind his head and lay quiet . Now he knew he was waiting . And he knew it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hands waited and his veins and a strangely alien tenderness within him . He got up , put on his dressing gown and sat down by the window . He felt the warmth of the soft wool on his skin . The robe was old ; he had had it with him for many years . He had slept in it on his flights ; he had warmed himself in it during the cold nights in Spain when , dead tired , he had come back from the field hospital to his barracks . Juana , twelve years old , with eyes eighty years old , had died under it in a wrecked hotel in Madri  --  ith the single wish sometime to own a dress of the same soft wool and to forget how her mother had been ravished and her father trampled to death . He looked around . The room , a few suitcases , some belongings , a handful of well-read book  --  man needed few things to live . And it was good not to get used to many things when life was unsettled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taken away . One should be ready to leave every day . That was the reason he had lived alon  --  hen one was on the move one should not have anything that could bind one . Nothing that could stir the heart . The adventur  --  ut nothing more . He looked at the bed . The crumpled colorless linen . It did not130T R I U M P Hmatter that he waited . He had often waited for women . But he felt that he had waited differentl  --  imply , clearly , and brutally . Also sometimes with the anonymous tenderness that enchases desirewith silve  --  ut for a long time not as he waited today . Somethinghad crept into him to which he had not paid any attention . Did it stir again ? Did it move ? How long ago was it ? Did somethingcall again out of oblivion , out of blue depths , did it again blow across him like the breath of meadows , full of peppermint , with a row of poplars against the horizon and the smell of woods in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not want to be possessed . He was on the move . He got up and began to dress . One must remain independent . Everything began with small dependencies . One did not notice them much . And suddenly one was entangled in the net of habit . Habit for which many names existe  --  ove was one of them . One should not grow accustomed to anything . Not even to a body . He did not lock the door . If Joan came she would not find him . She could stay if she wanted to . He deliberated for a second whether to leave a note . But he did not want to lie ; nor di-I he want to tell her where he had gone . He returned about eight o'clock in the morning . He had walked in the cold under the street lights of early dawn and had felt clear and relaxed . But as he stood in front of the hotel he felt again the tenseness . Joan was not there . Ravic assured himself that he had not expectedanything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked around and searched for a sign of her having been there . He found nothing . He rang for the maid . She came after a while . " I 'd like some breakfast , " he said . She looked at him . She said nothing . He did n't want to ask her any questions . " Coffee and croissants , Eve . " " Very well , Mr. Ravic . " He looked at the bed . If Joan had come one could not very well have expected her to lie down in a crumpled empty bed . Odd , how dead everything became that had to do with the body when there131T R I U M P IIwas no longer any warmt  --  bed , underwear , even a bath . It was repulsive when it had lost its warmth . He lighted a cigarette . She might have assumed that he had been called to see a patient . But then he could have left a note . Suddenlyhe thought himself a good deal of an idiot . He wanted to be independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eighteen year old who wants to prove something to himself . There was more dependency in this than if he had waited . The girl brought his breakfast . " Shall I do the bed now ? " she asked . " Why now ? " " In case you still want to go to sleep . One sleeps better in a freshly made bed . " She looked at him without expression . " Was someone here ? " he asked . " I do n't know . I only came at seven . " " Eve , " he said , " how does it feel to have to make a dozen strangers ' beds every morning ? " " It 's all right , Mr. Ravic . As long as the people do n't want anything else . But there are always a few who want more . Though the brothels are so cheap in Paris . " " In the morning one ca n't go into a brothel , Eve . And some guests feel particularly strong in the morning . " ' " Yes , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You lose the tip if you do n't do it , that 's all . Then too some make complaints every minute afterward  --  hat the room is not clean or that you are fresh . Naturally , out of anger . You ca n't do anything about it . That 's how life is . " Ravic pulled a bill out of his pocket . " Let 's make life somewhat easier today , Eve . Buy yourself a hat with that . Or a woolen jacket . " Eve 's eyes lost their dull expression . " Thank you , Mr. Ravic . Todayis starting well . Then should I make your bed later ? " " Yes . " She looked at him . " The lady is a very interesting lady , " she said . " The lady who keeps coming here now . " 13,2 " One more word and I 'll take the money away from you . " Ravic pushed Eve out of the door . " The old lechers are waiting for you . Do n't disappoint them . " He sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not taste particularly good . He got up and continued to eat standing . It tasted better . The sun hung red above the roofs . The hotel was waking up . Old man Goldberg on the floor below began his morning concert He coughed and groaned as if he had six lungs . The refugee Wiesenhoff opened his window and whistled a parade march . On the upper floor water gushed . Doors were slammed . Ravic stretched himself . The night had gone . The corruption of the dark was done with . He decided to remain alone for a few days . Outside the newspaper boys were calling out the morning news . Incidents at the Czechoslovakian frontier . German troops at the Sudeten line . The Munich pact jeopardized. 13311The boydid not scream . He just stared at the doctors . He was still too stunned to feel any pain . Ravic glanced at the crushed leg . " How old is he ? " he asked the mother . " What ? " the woman asked uncomprehendingly . " How old is he ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His leg ! " she said . " His leg ! It was a truck . " Ravic listened to his heart . " Has he been sick ? " " His leg ! " the woman said . " It is his leg ! " Ravic straightened up . The heart was beating quickly like a bird 's , but there was nothing alarming in the sound . During anesthesiahe would have to watch the boy , who looked emaciated and rachitic . He had to start immediately . The torn leg was full of street dirt . " Will you cut my leg off ? " the boy asked . " No , " Ravic said without believing it . " It 's better if you cut it off instead of its being stiff . " Ravic looked attentively at the precocious face . There was not yet any sign of pain in it . " We 'll see , " he said . " Now we 'll have to put you to sleep . It 's very simple . You need n't be afraid . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The number is FO 2019 . Will you put it down for my mother ? " " What ? What , Jeannot ? " his mother asked , startled . " I noticed the number . The number of the car . FO 2019 . I saw it close in front of me . There was a red light . It was the driver 's fault . " 134A R C H 0 F T R I U M U HThe boy began to breathe laboriously . " The insurance company must pay . The number ? " " I wrote it down , " Ravic said . " Be calm . I wrote everything down . " He motioned to Eugenie to start the anesthetic . " My mother must go to the police . The insurance company must pay ? " Large beads of perspiration appeared on his face as suddenly as if it had been rained on . " If you amputate the leg they pay mor  --  han if i  --  emains stiff ? " His eyes were sunk in blue-black circles which stood out from his skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say something . " My mothe  --  oes n't understan  --  el  --  er ? " He could no longer go on . He began to scream , dull , repressed screams as if a tortured animal cowered within him . " How is the world outside , Ravic ? " Kate Hegstroem asked . " Why do you want to know that , Kate ? Rather think of somethingpleasanter . " " I feel as though I have been here for weeks already . Everything else is so remote . As if submerged . " " Let it remain submerged for a while . " " No . Otherwise I 'll be afraid that this room is the last ark and that the deluge is already below the window . What 's going on outside , Ravic ? " " Nothing new , Kate . The world goes on eagerly preparing for suicide and at the same time deluding itself about what it 's doing . " " Will there be war ? " " Everyone knows that there will be war . What one does not yet know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " Never before have I seen so many politicians who believe in miracles as at present in France and England . And never so few as in Ger-many . " She remained lying silent for a while . " To think that it should be possible ? " she said then . " Ye  --  t seems so impossible that it will happen some day . Just because one considers it so impossible and does n't protect oneself against it . Do you have pain , Kate ? " 135 " Not so much that I ca n't stand it . " She adjusted her pillow under her head . " I 'd like to get away from all this , Ravic . " " Yes ? " he replied without conviction . " Who would n't like to ? " " When I get out of here I 'll go to Italy . To Fiesole . I have a quiet old house there with a garden . I want to stay there for a while . It will still be cool . A veiled serene sun . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening the bells of Florence . And at night the moon and the stars behind the cypresses . There are books in the house and there , is a big stone fireplace with wooden benches around it . The andirons for the wood are set up in such a manner as to hold a stand where one can put one 's glass . Red wine is warmed that way . No people . Only an old couple to keep one 's things in order . " She looked at Ravic . " Beautiful , " he said . " Quiet , a fireplace , books , and peace . In former days that sort of thing was considered bourgeois . Today it 's the dream of a lost paradise . " She nodded . " I want to stay there for a while . A few weeks . Maybe even a few months . I do n't know yet . I want to become calm . And then I 'll return and pack and go to America . " Ravic heard supper trays being carried in the corridor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , Kate , " he said . She hesitated . " Can I still have a child , Ravic ? " " Not right away . You 've got to become much stronger first . " " I do n't mean that . Can I have it sometime ? After this operation ? Is n't ? " " No , " Ravic said . " We did n't remove anything . Not a thing ! " She took a deep breath . " That 's what I wanted to know . " " But it will still take a long time , Kate . Your entire organismmust change first . " " It does not matter how long it takes . " She smoothed her hair . The stone on her hand glittered in the dark . " It is ridiculous that I am asking for that , is n't it ? Just now . " " No . That happens often . More often than one would think . " " Suddenly I have had enough of all this . I want to go back and marry , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be calm and praise God and love life . " T R I U M P HRavic looked out of the window . The wild red of the sunset hung over the roofs . The electric signs were drowned in it like bloodless shadows of colors . " It must seem absurd to you , after all you know about me , " Kate Hegstroem said behind him . " No , not at all . " " I 've thought about it these last two days . And I feel younger and lighter than I have for longer than I can remember . When I 'm over there I 'll forge ' the years here like a senseless dream . " Joan Madou came at four o'clock at night . Ravic woke up when he heard someone at the door . He had gone to sleep , not expecting her . He saw her standing in the open door . She tried to force her way through with an armful of giant chrysanthemums . He did not see her face . He only saw her figure and the huge bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A forest of chrysanthemums . For heaven 's sake , what does it mean ? " Joan got the flowers through the door and flung them with a flourish onto the bed . The blossoms were wet and cool and the leaves smelled of autumn and earth . " Presents , " she said . " Since I know you I 'm beginning to get presents . " " Take them away . I 'm not dead yet . To lie under flowerswhat'smore , chrysanthemum  --  he good old bed of the Hotel International really looks like a coffin . " " No ! " Joan snatched up the flowers from the bed with a violent movement and threw them on the floor . " You must n't ? " She straightened up . " Do n't talk like that ! Ever ! " Ravic looked at her . IIe had forgotten how they had met . " Forgetit , " he said . " I did n't mean anything . " " Do n't talk like that ever again . Not even as a joke . Promise ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Does it really frighten you so ? " " Yes . It is even worse . I do n't know what it is . " Ravic got up . " I 'll never make a joke about it again . Are you satisfied now ? " She nodded , leaning on his shoulder . " I do n't know what it is . I simply ca n't stand it . It 's like a hand reaching out of the dark . It is136 137A R C H O Ffea  --  lind fear as if it were lying in wait somewhere for me " She pressed close to him . " Do n't let it happen . " Ravic held her tight in his arms . " N  --  wo n't let it happen . " " She nodded again . " You can do it ? " " Yes , " he said with a voice full of sadness and derision , thinking of Kate Hegstroem . " I can . Of course I can ? " She moved in his arms . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were ? " " Yes . " " He was silent . Suddenly something perished . How childish he had been ! Waiting or not waitin  --  o what purpose ? A foolishgame with someone who did not play games . " You were not here ? " " No . " " I know I should n't ask you where you were ? " " No . " She freed herself from his embrace . " I 'd like to take a bath , " she said in a changed voice . " Outside it 's snowing . I 'm cold . Can I still do it ? Or will it wake up the hotel ? " Ravic smiled . " Do n't ask about the consequences if you want to do something . Otherwise you 'll never do it . " She looked at him . " One should ask in trifling matters . Never in great ones . " " Also correct " She went into the bathroom and let the water run . Ravic sat down by the window and reached for a box of cigarettes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town where silently the snow drifted . A taxi whined through the streets . The chrysanthemumsgleamed palely on the floor . A newspaper was lying on the sofa . He had brought it along in the evening . Fighting at the Czechoslovakian frontier . Fighting in China . An ultimatum . An overthrown cabinet . He took the paper and pushed it under the chrysanthemums . Joan came out of the bathroom . She was warm and crouched on the floor beside him among the flowers . " Where were you last night ? " she asked . T II I U M P HHe reached her down a cigarette . " Do you really want to know ? " " Yes . " He hesitated . " I was here , " he said then , " and waited for you . I thought you were n't coming and then I left . " Joan waited . Her cigarette glowed in the dark and died away again . " That 's all , " Ravic said . " Did you go out to drink ? " " Yes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said ; " did you really go away because of that ? " " Yes . " She put her arms on his knees . He felt her warmth through the dressing gown . It was her warmth and the warmth of the gown which was more familiar to him than many years of his life , and suddenly it seemed to him as if both had belonged together for a long time and as if Joan had returned to him from somewhere out of his life . " Ravic , I 've come to you every night . You ought to have known that I 'd come yesterday too . Did n't you go out because you did n't want to see me ? " " No . " " You can tell me when you do n't want to see me . " " I would tell you . " " Was n't it that ? " " No , it was really not that . " " Then I 'm happy . " Ravic looked at her . " What did you say ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell silent for a while . " Do you really know what you 're saying ? " he asked . " Yes . " The pale radiance from outside was mirrored in her eyes . " One should n't say something like that lightly , Joan . " " I 'm not saying it lightly . " " Happiness , " Ravic said . " Where does it start and where does it end ? " 138 139A R C H O FHis foot touched the chrysanthemums . Happiness , he thought . The blue horizons of youth . The golden-bright balance of life . Happiness ! My God , where was it now ? " It starts with you and ends with you , " Joan said . " That is quite simple . " Ravic did not reply . What is she talking about ? he thought . " Soon you will tell me that you love me , " he said then . " I love you . " He made a gesture . " You hardly know me , Joan . " " What has that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat means someone you want to grow old with . " " I do n't know anything about that . It is someone you can not live without . That 's what I know . " " Where is the calvados ? " Ravic asked . " On the table . I 'll get it for you . Stay where you are . " She brought the bottle and a glass and put them on the floor with the flowers . " I know that you do n't love me , " she said . " Then you know more than I do ? " She looked up quickly . " You will love me , " she said . " Fine . Let us drink to that . " " Wait . " She filled the glass and drained it . Then she filled it again and handed it to him . He took it and held it for a moment . All this is not true , he thought . A half dream in the waning night . Words spoken in the dar  --  ow can they be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know all that so precisely ? " he asked . " Because I love you . " How she handles that word , Ravic thought . Without deliberation , like an empty bowl . She fills it with something and calls it love . With how many things had it been filled already ! With fear of being alon  --  ith stimulation through another eg  --  ith the boosting of one 's self-relianc  --  ith the glittering reflection of one 's fantas  --  ut who really knows ? Was n't what I said about growing old together the stupidest thing of all ? Is n't she far more right with her spontaneousness ? And why do I sit here on a winter night , between wars , and spout words like a schoolmaster ? Why do I resist , instead of plunging myself into it disbelievingly ? " Why do you resist ? " Joan asked 140T II I U M P II " What ? " " Why do you resist ? " she repeated . " I do n't resis  --  hat should I resist ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and you do n't want to let anything or anyone in . " " Come , " Ravic said , " let me have another drink . " " I am happy and I wish you were happy , too . I am completely happy . I wake up with you and I go to sleep with you . I do n't know anything else . My head is made of silver when I think of both of us and sometimes it is like a violin . The streets are full of us as if we were music , and from time to time people break in and talk and pictures flash by like a movie , but the music remains . That always remains . " A few weeks ago you were still unhappy , Ravic thought , and you did not know me . An easy happiness . He emptied his glass of calvados . " Have you been happy often ? " he asked . " Not often . " " But sometimes . When was the last time your head was made of silver ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask something . Without a reason . " " I have forgotten . And I do n't want to know any more . It was different . " " It 's always different . " She smiled at him . Her face was bright and open like a flower with few leaves that hid nothing . " Two years ago , " she said . " It did not last long . In Milan . " " Were you alone at that time ? " " No . I was with someone else . He was very unhappy and jealous and did not understand . " " Naturally not . " " You would understand . He made terrible scenes . " " She made herselfcomfortable , pulled a pillow down from the sofa and pushed it behind her back . " He called me a whore and faithless and ungrateful . It was n't true . I was faithful as long as I loved him . He did n't understand that I did not love him any longer . " " One never understands that . " 141A R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I would always love you . You are different and everything is different with us . He wanted to kill me . " She laughed . " They always want to kill . A few months later the other one wanted to kill me . But they never do it . You would never want to kill me . " " Only with calvados , " Ravic said . " Pass the bottle . The conversation , thank God , is becoming more human . A few minutes ago I was pretty frightened . " " Because I love you ? " " We wo n't start that again . That 's like parading about in a frock coat and a powdered wig . We are togethe  --  or shorter or longer , who knows ? We are together , that 's enough . Why do we have to label it ? " " I do n't like that for shorter or longer . ' But those are only words . You wo n't leave me . These too are only words , and you know it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . " She looked at him . " One always leaves the other . Sometimesthe other is quicker . " " And what did you do ? " " Everything ! " She took the glass out of his hands and finished it . " Everything ! But it did n't help . I was terribly unhappy . " " For long ? " " For a week . About a week . " " That is n't long . " " It 's an eternity if you are really unhappy . I was so unhappy with every part of me that everything was exhausted after a week . My hair was unhappy , my skin , my bed , even my clothes . I was so filled with unhappiness that nothing else existed . And if nothing else exists any more , unhappiness ceases to be unhappines  --  ecausethere is nothing left with which to compare it . Then it is nothing but complete exhaustion . And then it is over . Slowly one starts to live again . " She kissed his hand . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thinking of ? " she asked . " Of nothing . Nothing but that you are of a wild innocence . Corn . pletely corrupt and not corrupt at all . The most dangerous thing in142T R I U M P Hthe world . Give me back the glass . I 'll drink to my friend Morosow , the connoisseur of the human heart . " " I do n't like Morosow . Ca n't we drink to someone else ? " " Naturally you do n't like him . He has keen eyes . Let 's drink to you . " " To me ? " " Yes , to you . " " I 'm not dangerous , " Joan said . " I 'm in danger , but not dan-gerous . " " The fact that you think so is part of it . Nothing will ever happen to you . Salute . " " Salute . But you do n't understand me . " " Who wants to understand ? That 's the cause of all misunderstandingsin the world . Pass me the bottle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink so much ? " " Joan , " Ravic said , " the day will come when you will say : Too much ! You drink too much , you 'll say and believe that you desire my good only . In reality , you will simply want to prevent my excursionsinto a sphere which you can not control . Salute ! Today we celebrate . We have gloriously escaped pathos which stood like a fat cloud outside the window . We slew it with pathos . Salute ! " She straightened up . She propped herself with her hands on the floor and looked at him . Her eyes were wide open , the bathrobe had slipped down from her shoulders , her hair was thrown back on the nape of her neck , and there was something of a bright young lioness about her in the dark . " I know , " she said calmly , " you 're laughing at me , I know it and I do n't mind . I feel that I 'm alive ; I feel it in my whole being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer dead , my joints have purpose again and my hands are no longer empty , and it does not matter to me what you think about it and what you may say about it , I let myself fly and I let myself run and I throw myself into it , without a thought , and I am happy and I am neither cautious nor afraid of saying it , even if you do laugh at me and make fun of me ? " Ravic was silent for a while . " I 'm not making fun of you , " he then said . " I 'm making fun of myself , Joan ? " 143A R C H 0 FShe leaned toward him . " Why ? There is something in the back of your head that resists . Why ? " " There is nothing that resists . I am just slower than you are . " She shook her head . " It 's not only that . There 's something that wants to remain alone . I feel it . It 's like a barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely fifteen more years of life than you have had . Not everyone 's life is like a house that belongs to him and that he can go on decorating ever more richly with the furniture of his memory . Some people live in hotels , in many hotels . The years close behind them like hotel door  --  nd the only thing that rernains is a little courage and no regrets . " She did not answer for some time . He did not know whether she had listened to him or not . He looked out of the window and calmly felt the deep glow of the calvados in his veins . The beat of the pulses was still and became a widespread quietness in which the machine guns of ceaselessly ticking time were silent . The moon rose , a blurred red , over the roofs like the cupola of a mosque , half hidden by clouds , emerging slowly while the earth sank into the drifting snow . " I know , " Joan said , her hands on his knees and her chin on her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things about myself . I could be silent or I could lie , but I do n't want to . Why should I not tell you everything about my life and why should I make more out of it ? I 'd rather make less out of it because it is laughable to me now and I do n't understand it any more and you may laugh about it and also about me too . " Ravic looked at her . One of her knees was crushing a few of the large white blossoms against the newspaper he had bought . A strange night , he thought . Somewhere now there is shooting and men are being hunted and imprisoned and tortured and murdered , some corner of a peaceful world is being trampled upon , and one knows it , helplessly , and life buzzes on in the bright bistros of the city , no one cares , and people go calmly to sleep , and I am sitting here with a woman between pale chrysanthemums and a bottle of calvados , and the shadow of love rises , trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exile from the safe gardens of the past , shy and wild and quick as if it had no right144T R I U M P H " Joan , " he said slowly and wanted to say something entirely different , " it is good that you are here . " She looked at him . He took her hands . " You understand what that means ? More than a thousand other words ? " She nodded . Suddenly her eyes were filled with tears . " It does n't mean anything , " she said , " I know . " " That 's not true , " Ravic replied and knew that she was right . " No , nothing at all . You must love me , beloved . That 's all . " He did not answer . " You must love me , " she repeated . " Otherwise I 'm lost . " Los  --  e thought . What a word ! How easily she uses it . Who is really lost does not talk. 11,512 " Did youtake my leg off ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the wall of an old house . His freckles stood out very large and dark as though they did not belong to his face but were drops of paint sprinkled over it . The stump of his leg lay under a wire basket over which the blanket was drawn . " Have you any pain ? " Ravic asked . " Yes . In my foot . My foot hurts very much . I asked the nurse . The old dragon would n't tell me . " " The leg has been amputated , " Ravic said . " Above the knee or below the knee ? " " Ten centimeters above it . Your knee was crushed and could not be saved . " " Good , " Jeannot said . " That makes about fifteen per cent more from the insurance company . Very good . An artificial leg is an artificialleg , whether above or below the knee . But fifteen per cent more is something you can put into your pocket every month . " He hesitated for a moment . " For the time being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see it anyway with this parrot cage over the stump . " " We wo n't tell her anything , Jeannot . " " The insurance company must pay an annuity for life . That 's correct , is n't it ? " " I think so . " His face twisted into a grimace . " They 'll be surprised . I am146A R C H 0 F T R 1 L ' M P Hthirteen years old . They 'll have to pay for a long time . Do you know yet which insurance company it is ? " " Not yet . But we have the number of the car . You kept it in mind . The police have been here already . They want to question you . You were still asleep this morning . They 'll come again to-night " Jeannot deliberated . " Witnesses , " he said then . " It 's important that we have witnesses . Have we any ? " " I think your mother has two addresses . She had the slips of paper in her hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If only she has n't lost them already . You know how old people are . Where is she now ? " " Your mother sat at your bedside all night and until noon today . Only then were we able to send her away . She 'll come back again soon . " " Let 's hope shell still have them . The police ? " He made a weak gesture with his emaciated hand . " Cheats , " he murmured . " They are all cheats . In cahoots with the insurance companies . But if one has good witnesse  --  hen will she come back ? " " Soon . Do n't get excited about it . It 'll be all right . " Jeannot moved his mouth as if he were chewing something . " Sometimes they pay the whole amount at once . A settlement instead of an annuity . We could start a business with it , mother and I. " " Now rest , " Ravic said .

" " They 'll wake you up . " " Red light . I 'm sure it was a red light . " " Certainly . And now try to sleep . There is a bell in case you should need anything . " " Doctor ? " " Yes ? " Ravic turned around. 147A R C H O F " If everything works out ? " Jeannot lay on his pillow and some- thing like a smile flitted across his twisted , precocious face . " Some- times one is lucky after all , is n't one ? " The evening was humid and warm . Tattered clouds floated low over the city . In front of Fouquet 's restaurant , circular coke-ovens had been set up . A few tables and chairs stood around them . Moro- sow was sitting at one of them . Ile beckoned to Ravic . " Come , have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We sit too much in rooms , " Moro- sow declared . " Has that ever occurred to you ? " " But you do n't . You 're always standing in front of the Sche- herazade . " " My boy , spare me your miserable logic . Evenings I 'm a sort of two-legged door at the Scheherazade , but not a human being in the open . We live in rooms too much , I say . We think too much in rooms . We make love too much in rooms . We despair too much in rooms . Can you despair in the open ? " " And how ! " Ravic said . " Only because we live too much in rooms . Not if one is used to the open . One despairs more decently in a landscape than in a two-room-and-kitchenette apartment . More comfortably , too . Do n't contradict me ! To contradict shows an occidental narrow- ness of the mind . Who actually wants to be right ? Today is my day off and I wish to absorb life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rooms . " " We also urinate too much in rooms . " " Get away with your irony . The facts of life are simple and trivial . Only our imagination gives life to them . It makes the laundry pole of facts a flagstaff of dreams . Am I right ? " " No . " " Of course not . I do n't even want to be . " " Of course you are right . " " Good , brother . We also sleep too much in rooms . We become pieces of furniture . Stone buildings have broken our spines . We have become walking sofas , dressing tables , safes , leases , salaries , kitchen pots , and water toilets . " T R I U M P H " Correct . Walking party platforms , ammunition factories , institutesfor the blind and asylums for the insane . " " Do n't keep interrupting me . Drink , be quiet and live , you murdererwith the scalpel .

We 're afraid of the too great words in love and not afraid of much too great words in politics . A sorry generation ! " Morosow winked . Ravic winked , too . " Good old cynic with dreams , " he said . " Are you engaged in improving the world again ? " Morosow grinned . " I 'm engaged in feeling it , you romantic withoutillusions , for a short time on earth , called Ravic . " Ravic laughed . " For a very short time . This is now my third life as far as names go . Is this Polish vodka ? " " Estonian . From Riga . The best . Pou  --  nd then let us sit calmly here and stare at the most beautiful street in the world and praise this mild evening and casually spit in the face of despair . " The fire in the coke-ovens crackled . A man with a violin took up a position by the curb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jostled him , the bow scraped , but the man continued to play as if he were alone . It sounded thin and empty . The violin seemed to be freezing . Two Moroccans went from table to table and offered garish carpets of artificial silk . The newspaper boys passed with the latest editions . Morosow bought the Paris Soir and the Intransigeant . He read the headlines and pushed the newspapers aside . " They are all damned counterfeiters , " he growled . " Have you ever observed that we are living in the age of counterfeiters ? " " No . I thought we were living in the age of cans . " " Cans ? How so ? " Ravic pointed at the newspapers . " Cans . We do n't have to think any more . Everything is pre-meditated , pre-chewed , pre-felt . Cans . All you have to do is open them . Delivered to your home three times a day . Nothing any more to cultivate yourself , or let grow and148 149A R C H O Fboil on the fire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He grinned . " We do n't live easily , Boris . Just cheaply . " " Cans with false labels . " Morosow lifted the papers . " Counterfeiting ! Take a look at that ! They build their ammunition factories because they want peace ; their concentration camps because they love the truth ; justice is the cover for every factional madness ; political gangsters are saviors ; and freedom is the big word for all greed for power . Counterfeit money ! Counterfeit spiritual money ! The lie as propaganda . Kitchen Machiavellism . Idealism in the hands of the underworld . If at least they would be honest ? " He crushed the newspapers together and threw them away . " Very likely we are reading too many newspapers in rooms , " Ravic said and laughed . " Naturally . In the open one only needs them to start a fire ? " Morosow stopped abruptly . Ravic was no longer sitting beside him . He had jumped up and was pushing his way through the crowd in front of the cafe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , astonished . Then he pulled some money out of his pocket , threw it onto a china plate beside the glasses , and followed Ravic . He did not know what had happened but he followed him anyhow , to be at hand if he should need him . He saw no police . Neither did he see any plain-clothes detectives hunting Ravic . The sidewalks were packed with people . Good for him , Morosow thought . If a policeman recognized him , he can easily escape . He saw Ravic again only when he had reached the Avenue George V. The traffic lights changed at that moment and the jammed lines of cars dashed forward . Notwithstanding , Ravic tried to cross the street . A taxi almost knocked him down . The cabdriver was furious . Morosow grabbed Ravic 's arm from behind and pulled him back . " Are you mad ? " he cried . " Do you want to commit suicide ? What 's the matter ? " Ravic did not answer . He stared across the street . The traffic was very dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impossible to get through . Morosow shook him . " What happened , Ravic ? The police ? " " No . " Ravic did not take his eyes from the passing cars. 150T R I U M P H " What is it ? What is it , Ravic ? " " Haake ? " " What ? " Morosow 's eyes narrowed . " What does he look like ? Quick ! Quick , Ravic ! " " A gray coat ? " The shrill whistle of the traffic policeman came from the middle of the Champs Elysees . Ravic dashed across between the last cars . A dark gray coa  --  hat was all he knew . He crossed the Avenue George V and the Rue Bassano . Suddenly there were dozens of gray coats . He cursed and walked on as quickly as he could . The traffic had stopped at the Rue Galilee . He rapidly crossed it and ruthlesslypushed his way through the crowd , along the Champs Elysees . He came to the Rue de Presbourg , crossed it , and suddenlystood still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confusing , full of traffic , with streets branching off in all directions . Gone ! No one could be found here . He turned around slowly , still scrutinizing the faces of the crow  --  ut his excitement was gone . Suddenly he felt very empty . He must have been mistaken agai  --  r Haake had escaped him a second time . But could one be mistaken twice ? Could someone disappear from the surface of the earth twice ? There were the sidestreets . Haake could have turned into one of those . He looked along the Rue de Presbourg . Cars , cars , and people , people . The busiest hour of the evening . There was no point in searching along them . Too late again . " Nothing ? " Morosow asked when he caught up with him . Ravic shook his head . " I am probably seeing ghosts again . " " Did you recognize him ? " " I thought so . Only just a minute ago . No  --  ow I do n't know at all . " Morosow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look alike , Ravic . " " Yes , and some that one never forgets . " Ravic stood still . " What do you want to do ? " Morosow asked . " I do n't know . What can I do now ? " Morosow stared into the crowd . " Damned bad luck ! Just at this time . Close of business . Everything crowded ? " 151A R C H O F " Yes " And , moreover , the light ! Half-darkness . Could you see him well ? " Ravic did not answer . Morosow took his arm . " Listen , " he said . " Running around in the streets and cross-streets is pointless . While you are looking through one street you will think he is in the next one . Not a chance . Let 's go back to Fouquet 's . That 's the best place . You can keep a better lookout from there than by running around . In case he comes back , you 'll be able to see him from there . " They sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two directions . For a long time they sat in silence . " What do you intend to do if you meet him ? " Morosow asked finally . " Do you know yet ? " Ravic shook his head . " Think about it . It 's better for you to know beforehand . There 's no sense in being taken by surprise and doing something foolish . Particularly not in your situation . You do n't want to be imprisoned for years ? " Ravic looked up . He did not answer . He only looked at Morosow . " It would n't matter to me , " Morosow said . " If it were me . But it does matter to me in your case . What would you have done if he had been the one and you had got hold of him across the street at the corner ? " " I do n't know , Boris . I really do n't know . " " You have nothing on you , have you ? " " No . " " If you had attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a minute . By now you would be at police headquartersand he would probably have got away with a few blackand-bluemarks . You know that , do n't you ? " " Yes . " Ravic stared into the street . Morosow deliberated . " At best you might have tried to push him under an automobile at the intersection . But that would n't have been sure either . He might have got away with a couple of scratches . " T R I U M P Ii " I wo n't push him under an automobile , " Ravic replied without taking his eyes from the street . " I know that . I would n't do it either . " Morosow was silent for a while . " Ravic , " he said then . " If he was the one and if you meet him you must be dead sure what to do , you know that ? You 'll have only one chance . " " Yes , I know . " Ravic continued to stare into the street . " If you should see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only follow him . Find out where he lives . Nothing else . All the rest you can work out later . Take your time . Do nothing foolish . Do you hear ? " " Yes , " Ravic said absent-mindedly and stared into the street . A man selling pistachio nuts came to their table . He was followed by a boy with toy mice . He made them dance on the marble table top and run up his sleeve . The violin player appeared for the second time . Now he wore a hat and played Parlez moi d'amour . An old lady with a syphilitic nose was hawking violets . Morosow looked at his watch . " Eight , " he said . " It 's senseless to wait any longer , Ravic . We 've been sitting here for over two hours already . The man wo n't come back now . Everyone in France is eating supper somewhere at this hour . " " Why do n't you go , Boris ? Why are you sitting around here with me anyhow ? " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here with you as long as we like . But I do n't want you to drive yourself crazy . It 's senselessfor you to wait here for hours . The chances of meeting him are now the same everywhere . No , now they are greater in any restaurant , in any night club , in any brothel . " " I know , Boris . " Ravic stared into the street . The traffic had become less dense . Morosow put his large hairy hand on Ravic 's arm . " Ravic , " he said , " listen . If you are destined to meet that man , you 'll meet hi  --  nd if not , then you can wait for him for years . You know what I mean . Keep your eyes ope  --  verywhere . And be prepared for anything . But otherwise go on living as if you were mistaken . That 's the only thing you can do . Otherwise you will ruin yourself. 152 153A R C H 0 FI lived through the same thing once .

" " You go and have something to eat , Boris . I 'll come later . " " Do you intend to stay here ? " " Just for another moment . Then I 'll go to the hotel . I have something to do there . " Morosow looked at him . He knew what Ravic wanted to do in the hotel . But he also knew that he could n't do anything else . Thiswas Ravic 's business alone . " All right , " he said . " I 'll be at the Mere Marie . Later at Bublishki 's . Call me or come there . " He raised hisbushy eyebrows . " And do n't run any risks . Do n't be a hero for nothing ! And a damned idiot . Do n't shoot unless you are sure youcan escape . This is no child 's play and no gangster movie . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ravic went to the Hotel International and started back immediately . On his way he passed the Hotel de Milan . He looked at hiswatch . It was eight-thirty . He could still find Joan at home . She came toward him . " Ravic , " she said surprised . " You 've comehere ? " " Yes " You 've never been here , do you know that ? Since the day youbrought me here . " He smiled absent-mindedly . " That 's true , Joan . We lead astrange life . " " Yes . Like moles . Or bats . Or owls . We see each other only whenit is dark . " She walked through the room with long lithe strides . She wore adark-blue tailored dressing gown , drawn tight about her hips with a belt . The black evening gown which she wore at the Scheherazadewas lying on the bed . She was very beautiful and infinitely remote . " Do n't you have to go , Joan ? " " No . Not for half an hour . This is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You see what I have ? Coffee and all the time in the world . And now even you are here . I have calvados too . " 154T R I U M P HShe brought the bottle . He took it and put it , unopened , on the table . Then he took her hands . " Joan , " he said . The light in her eyes dimmed . She stood close to him . " Tell me at once what it is ? " Why ? What should it be ? " " Something . There is always something the matter when you are this way . Did you come because of that ? " He felt her hands trying to pull away from him . She did not move . Even her hands did not move . It was only as if something in them wanted to pull away from him . " You ca n't come tonight , Joan . Not tonight and perhaps not tomorrow and not for a few days . " " Do you have to stay at the hospital ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't talk about it . But it is something that has nothing to do with you and me . " She stood there for a while , motionless . " All right , " she said then . " You understand ? " " No . But if you say so , it is right . " " You are n't angry ? " She looked at him . " My God , Ravic , " she said . " How could I ever be angry with you about anything ? " He looked up . It was as though a hand had pressed hard on his heart . Joan had spoken without purpose , but nothing she could have done would have touched him more . He paid little heed to what she murmured and whispered during the night ; it was forgottenas soon as dawn stood gray , outside the window . He knew that the rapture of those hours in which she crouched or lay at his side was as much rapture over herself , and he took it for intoxicationand the shining avowal of the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , like a flier who , through an opening of gleaming clouds on which the light plays hide-and-seek , suddenly perceives the earth below , green , brown , and solid , he saw more .

It was always the little things that brought revelatio  --  ever the big ones . The big ones were too tied up with dramatic gestures and the temptation to lie. 155A R C H O FA room . A hotel room .

Hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'll hold you ? He stood up . " Good night , Joan . " " Good night , Ravic . " He was sitting in front of the Cafe Fouquet . He was sitting at the same table as before . He sat there for hours , buried in the darkness of his past in which only a single feeble light burned : the hope for revenge . They had arrested him in August , 1933 . He had kept two friends of his who were wanted by the Gestapo hidden at his place for two weeks and he had then helped them to escape . One of them had saved his life in 1917 at Bixschoote in Flanders and had brought him back under cover of machine-gun fire when he had been lying in No Man 's Land , slowly bleeding to death . The other was a Jewishwriter whom he had known for years . He had been brought up for examination ; they wanted to find out in which direction the two had escaped , what papers they had on them and who would be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . After he had fainted the first time he had tried to shoot or strike down Haake with his own revolver . He had jumped into a crashing red darkness . It had been a useless attempt against four strong , armed men . For three days out of unconsciousness , slow awakening , out of frantic pain Haake 's cool smiling face emerged . For three days the same question  --  or three days the same body , bruised all over , almost incapable of further suffering . And then on the afternoon of the third day Sybil was brought in . She did not know about anything . He was shown to her to force a confession from her . She was a beautiful , luxury-loving creature who had lived a carefree superficial life . He had expected her to scream and break down . She did not break down . She turned on the torturers . She used deadly words . Deadly for her and she knew it . Haake had ceased156T R I U M P Hsmiling . He had cut short the examination . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the concentration camp for women if he did not confess . Ravic had not answered . Haake had explained to him what would happen to her before that . Ravic had not confessed to anything because there was nothing to confess . He had tried to convince Haake that this woman could not know anything . He had told him that he only knew her superficially . That she had meant little more in his life than a beautiful picture . That he could never have confided anything to her . All this had been true . Haake had only smiled . Three days later Sybil was dead . She had hanged herself in the concentration camp for women . A day later one of the fugitives was brought back . It was the Jewish writer . When Ravic saw him he could no longer recognize him , not even by his voice . It took another week before he was finally dead under Haake 's examination . Then came the concentration camp for Ravic . The hospital . The escape from the hospital . The silver moon stood above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Champs Elysees flickered in the wind . The lights of night were reflected in the glasses on the table . Unreal , Ravic thought , unreal the one and the other . Unreal these glasses , this moon , this street , this night , and this hour that touches me with its breath , strange and familiar as if it had been here before , in another life , on another sta  --  nreal these memories of years that are past , submerged , alive and dead at the same time , only phosphorescingnow in my brain and petrified into expectatio  --  nreal this fluid rolling through the darkness of my veins , unresting , 98.6 in temperature , slightly salty in flavor , four liters of secrecy and drive , blood , and the reflection in ganglia , the invisible storehouse in nothingness , called memory .

Long rows of houses , stretching endlessly , rows of windows and packed behind them bundles of fate , by the block . The heartbeat of millions of157men , the incessant beat as of a millionfold motor , moving slowly , slowly along the street of life , with every throb a tiny millimeter closer to death . He got up . The Champs Elysees was almost empty . Only a few whores loitered at the corners . He walked down the street , passed the Rue Pierre Charron , the Rue Marbeuf , the Rue Marignan to the Rond Point and back to the Arc de Triomphe . He stepped over the chains and stood before the tomb of the Unknown Soldier . The small blue flame flickered in the shadow . A withering wreath lay in front of it . He crossed the Etoile and went to the bistro where he thought he had first seen Haake . A few taxi drivers were still sitting there . He sat down by the window where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street outside was empty . The drivers were talking about Hitler . They found him ridiculous and prophesied his immediate downfall should he dare to come near the Maginot Line . Ravic stared into the street . Why am I sitting here ? he thought . I could be sitting anywhere in Paris ; the chances are the same . He looked at his watch . It was just before three . Too late . Haak  --  f it had been h  --  ould not be roaming the streets at this time . Outside he saw a whore strolling around . She looked inside through the window and walked on . If she comes back I 'll go , he thought . The whore came back . He did not go . If she comes once more I 'll certainly go , he decided . Then Haake is not in Paris . The whore returned . She beckoned with her head and passed by . He remained sitting . She returned once more . He did not go . The waiter put the chairs on the tables . The cabdrivers paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light above the counter . The room was plunged into murky darkness . Ravic looked around . " The check , " he said . Outside it had become windier and colder . The clouds floated higher and faster . Ravic walked by Joan 's hotel and stopped . All was dark except one window where a lamp shimmered behind curtains . It was Joan 's room . He knew that she hated to enter a dark room by herself . She had left the light on because she was not coming to him today . He looked up and suddenly he no longerT I I I U M P Hunderstood himself . Why did n't he want to see her ? The memory of the other woman had died long ago ; only the memory of her death had remained . And the other thing ? What did it have to do with her ? What did it still have to do even with himself ? Was n't he a fool to chase an illusion , the reflex of an entangled , blackened memory , a dark reactio  --  o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by mere chance , by an accursed resemblanc  --  o allow a piece of the rotted past to break open again , the abscess of a barely healed neurosi  --  nd thereby jeopardize everything he had built up in himself , his own self , that clear bit of life divorced from what he had been , the life he had created for himself and the only person close to him ? What had the one to do with the other ? Had n't he taught himself that time and again ? How else could he have escaped ? And where would he be without it ? He felt that the lump of lead in his brain was melting away . He breathed deeply . The wind came along the street with swift blasts . He looked up at the lighted window again . There was someone to whom he meant something , someone to whom he was important , someone whose face changed when she looked at hi  --  nd he had been about to sacrifice that to a twisted illusion , to the impatient , disdainful arrogance born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he really want ? Why did he resist ? What was he savinghimself for ? Life offered itself to him and he raised objections . Not because there was too littl  --  ecause there was too much . Had the bloody thunderstorm of his past to sweep over him that he could recognize it ? He moved his shoulders . Heart , he thought , heart ! How it opened itself up ! How it throbbed ! Window , he thought , lonely window lit at night , reflection of another 's life that had given itself up to him passionately , waiting , open , until he too should open .
