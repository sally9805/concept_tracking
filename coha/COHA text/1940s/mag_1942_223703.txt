The U.S. cargo ship 's skipper ordered Sparks to relay the S. O. S. Neither the captain , the first officer nor Sparks saw anything suspicious about the signal reporting a ship in distress some 30 miles distant in the South Atlantic . Soon night closed down over the unruffled sea and the third officer spotted lights about three miles away . Swiftly the lights grew closer to starboard . At three-quarters of a mile the approaching ship opened fire . Shells from 8-in. guns tore into the cargo vessel , quickly putting its deck guns out of action . Torpedoes from the deck tubes of the attacker plowed through the sea . On the victim 's port side , tracer bullets slashed the darkness . <P> It was a trap , baited with cynical confidence that a U.S. merchant ship would observe the law of the sea and relay a distress signal , thereby revealing her position .

Within half an hour the cargo ship went down . Out of the darkness the raider loomed closer to the spot . <P> " We slid over the side of our raft and held on , " said the second officer . " We heard a voice saying in perfect English : ' Come alongside boys . ' After a while somebody said in German : ' There 's nobody on this one . ' Then the raider disappeared . Later we found lifeboats with their oars shipped , indicating that some of the men had accepted the invitation to go alongside and had been taken prisoner aboard the raider . " <P> At least 15 of the crew were killed by gunfire . Some 20 were taken prisoner . The rest , after making 450 miles in five days in a sail-equipped lifeboat , were picked up and taken to an African port . They were the first survivors to confirm the presence of an armed surface raider in the South Atlantic . <P> &gt;Though German and Italian U-boats also were intensifying their South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrol planes operating off now-belligerent Brazil blasted seven more U-boats .
