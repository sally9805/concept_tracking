For color-loving , fun-seeking Sudanese there were color and fun aplenty . It was Leilat el Isra , anniversary of Mohamed 's visit to the seven heavens on his human-faced steed el Buraq . It was also the birthday anniversary of Mohamed Ahmed el Mahdi , whose fanatic desert dervishes destroyed " Chinese " Gordon 's British army in the Sudan in 1885 . <P> As the great day arrived last week , the Mahdi 's son , 63-year-old Sayed Sir Abdul Rahman el Mahdi Pasha , now the darling of the British because he opposes union of the Sudan with Egypt , was ready to reopen his father 's tomb at Omdurman . In ruins since Lord Kitchener 's army shattered it with artillery in the reoccupation of the Sudan in 1898 , the tomb was rebuilt this year with British permission . <P> Three thousand desert dervishes in flowing abbayas streamed into town on camels , horses and rickety provincial trains . Ten thousand Sudanese jammed the big dusty square before the stuccoed , white-domed tomb , brightening the drab town with pink , blue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time since the Mahdi 's victory over Gordon , big black , green and red banners , bearing the silver crescent , and dervish spear , danced overhead . Inside the tomb enclosure , women rocked and swayed over big rawhide drums , wailing mournful tunes in high-pitched tones . <P> Camel Meat for the Poor . Through the mud-brick city Sayed Abdul Rahman 's spanking new black Chevrolet picked its way . As it entered the square before the tomb , butchers hacked off the heads of three camels and seven oxen . They threw hunks of bleeding meat to the city 's poor . Unruffled , the Mahdi 's son stepped daintily from his car , unfurled a light blue parasol , mounted the notables ' platform . <P> Grizzled old desert sheiks , who remembered the brief days of victory , wept as Sayed Abdul Rahman cut the orange ribbon across the tomb 's doorway . Inside , a green , red and blue glass dome cast gaudy light on a glass chandelier and handsome Persian rug ( the gift of Neighbor Emperor Haile Selassie ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffin , which he claimed to have found in the ruins of the old tomb last year . <P> Waiting for the Brides . Then Sayed Abdul Rahman and his followers turned to still greater joys . On this day of days , Sudanese bridegrooms could marry for an $8 dowry instead of the usual expensive outlay for bridal clothes and marriage feasts . Four hundred bridegrooms took advantage of the cut rate . They faced their brides ' proxies ( the brides ' fathers ) and took the marriage vows . While the absent , newlywed wives waited expectantly at home , the menfolk took off to pub-crawl the cafs of flag-decked Omdurman , to feast , sing and dance . <P> In the square before the Mahdi 's tomb , the poor cooked their free camel and ox meat on great bonfires . The big war drums boomed through the night . After seven days of merrymaking , the husbands would claim their brides , the British could sigh with relief . For then the Mahdi 's dervishes , wives and all , would melt back into the deserts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
