The Marine Corps Women 's Reserve , proud and pleased with themselves , this week will celebrate their first birthday . <P> From their New River ( N.C. ) boot camp , some 10,000 Reserves have gone to post assignments . Recruiting has been better than in some of the other women 's organizations ; the Marines expect to fill their modest quota of 18,000 without trouble . <P> The Marine women come from many places and occupations . Tall , dark-haired 2nd Lieut . Jane Greenough , who is now an aerial photo interpretation officer at nearby Cherry Point , is a graduate of Vassar and was working in the Portland ( Ore . ) Art Museum when she joined the Corps . Private Edna Thomas , now an aerial gunnery instructor , was an elementary schoolteacher in Savonburg , Kans. 1st Lieut . Virginia O'Meara , who wears her greying hair upswept , was an assistant scriptwriter in Hollywood before she started her own insurance business in Bayside , L.I . <P> The average age of enlisted women is 20-22 , of officers , 25-35 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more years in college . Colonel John M. Arthur can recall only four serious cases of wrongdoing since he became commandant of the Reserve Schools last August . Two girls went A.W.O.L. ; one turned out to be drunk ; one was a thief . <P> After Dark . Despite their spit &; polish , the girls are still girls . The men flock to the Reserves ' recreation hall and , when they are not invited , try to crash it . In their barracks , after dark , the girls turn up in ruffly nightgowns , tailored pajamas , housecoats , satin robes and all kinds of footgear , from fancy mules to fleece-lined booties . <P> Washrooms are full of fuss and flutter , and the babbling confusion of Marines in undress waiting to take showers , crowding around mirrors to put their hair in curlers and massaging their faces with creams . In the grey dawn they comb out the pin curls , feverishly powder noses , paint on lipstick ( which matches the Marine red hat-cord ) and dash off to breakfast and their duties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the post administration building . They inspect and pack parachutes at the loft , teach gunnery to the men , operate Link trainers , help in the control tower . The photography department is now exclusively a woman 's domain . <P> In the Best Tradition . Smart and helpful , the Reserves are also self-sufficient . The New River maintenance crew , for instance , is allowed to handle up to 220-voltage electricity and performs the plumbing and carpentry chores in the women 's area . Corporal Billie Holcomb , who has a Marine staff sergeant father and an Army sergeant husband in the Aleutians , is boss . <P> In her crew are Electricians Myra Iorg and Thelma Watson , who once worked in defense plants ; Carpenter Ruth Wallick , who has three brothers in the Army and says that she used to do all the carpentry around home ; Plumber Marguerete Julien ; Plumber Laura Derrickson , who once attended the Fort Wayne Bible Institute , now zealously preaches the doctrine of not throwing anything in the " heads " - because if one gets stopped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulkhead.
