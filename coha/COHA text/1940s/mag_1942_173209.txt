Don Nelson last week reshaped WPB . NDAC had lasted eleven months , 0PM twelve and one-half , SPAB four and one-half months . <P> Each defense agency was born out of confusion , and died of strangulation by red tape . Each left unsolved the great root question : Should civilians or the military allocate war-scarce materials ? WPB and Donald Nelson insisted that civilians should do the allocating , that the civilian economy must be protected , or the whole war effort would suffer . His reshuffle of WPB last week was a sign that his victory over the services , still struggling for control of materials , was practically complete . <P> No longer would Nelson have to keep an eye on every tiny administrative detail in order to head off incipient Army &; Navy thrusts . <P> Realignment . Nelson explained that he had realigned WPB , not reorganized it . He is a " kind of umpire , " said he , with plenty of authority to decide what supplies go to civilian needs , to Lend-Lease , Army , Navy . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except plant conversion . The Army can decide for itself , said Nelson , how it can best use what it gets . <P> Unwilling as ever to hurt anybody by firing him , he packed Phil Reed , chief of the bureau of industry branches , off to London , as he had transferred Walter Wheeler , former chief of WPB subcontracting , to the Boston regional office . <P> &gt; He upped genial , broad-shouldered , tall William Loren Batt , 57 , from chairman of the requirements committee to be vice chairman of WPB. chief of staff to determine policies , direct operations . Batt rose from a Wabash farm and an Indiana roundhouse to head the big S.K.F. Industries ( ball bearings ) , went into NDAC in May 1940 . <P> &gt; For another vice chairman and his deputy on the combined production and resources board , Nelson picked slim , ruddy-faced , grey-haired James S. Knowlson , former director of WPB 's industry operations , an oldtime friend from Chicago . President of Stewart-Warner Corp. , Knowlson became Nelson 's deputy director of priorities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members : " If there 's any guy who does n't think we can deliver this program in 1942 , he had better get his time check , turn in his tools and get the hell out of here , quick . " <P> &gt; The job of putting into operation Knowlson 's program governing the flow of materials was handed to handsome , athletic , 42-year-old Amory Houghton III , board chairman of Corning Glass Works . Houghton , of the fourth generation of glassmaking Houghtons , joined the firm as a glass blower on his graduation from Harvard in 1921 . He rose quickly . <P> &gt; Nelson left open the fourth big job , that of deputy chairman on program progress who checks on performance to anticipate bottlenecks , detect causes of failure , correct mistakes as they pop up . <P> Work to be Done . Donald Nelson hoped his realignment would stick . Some problems were left on the stove to simmer . One is a serious transportation jam , but he could do little with it . For Transportation Chief Joe Eastman has no status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold Ickes ' separate jurisdiction over petroleum . Authority over electric power rests with six different Federal agencies . Plant expansion has to be checked again , lest there be more factories than materials to feed them .
