" What are they worrying about ? " asked Editor Thomas Dabney of the Socorro , N.Mex . Chieftain . " All the critters came back to the crater , and they 're just as ornery as they ever were . " <P> Last week , on the fourth anniversary of the explosion of the first atomic bomb , reporters were being shown around the crater at " Trinity , " birthplace of the Atomic Age . The crater , still surrounded by a high wire fence , is still radioactive . A man lying down in it for only a few hours would get all the radiation he could safely absorb in a week . <P> Green Scum &; Twisted Steel . Since the crater was first shown to outsiders ( TIME , Sept. 17 , 1945 ) , its appearance has become less dramatic . There are no longer any lead-shielded , white-painted Sherman tanks lumbering about the crater . The great sheet of crackly " trinitite " ( glassy melted soil ) that looked like a scummy green lake has largely disintegrated ; only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Occasionally , fragments glitter in the sun . The crater is still a shallow , rimless saucer pressed down into the earth by the force of the explosion . In it may be seen a few twisted bits of metal and the reinforced concrete foundations of the tall steel tower that the bomb blew away as vapor . <P> For the last two summers Drs . Albert W. Bellamy and Kermit Larson , of the University of California at Los Angeles , have been working with a party of twelve helpers in the region around Trinity . To calm local worries , they pretended that they were studying local plants and animals . Actually , they were estimating the biological effects of the atomic explosion . They collected over 600 different kinds of plants . They trapped a variety of animals and examined them for radioactivity and possible organic changes . They measured the radioactivity of the soil over a wide region . <P> Tumbleweed &; Antelope . Most of their findings were negative . Both plants and animals have come back with a rush to the atom-blasted area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are rattlesnakes , lizards , pack rats and mice in the vicinity-none of them , apparently , the worse for their hot habitat . A cottontail rabbit has a home in the crater itself . The antelope ( which local stories said had been frightened into Mexico ) are back in the great arid valley . <P> But Drs . Bellamy and Larson are still cautious . Radioactive dust , they say , was blown high in the air by the explosion . Carried by the wind , it settled back to earth in a northeasterly area ten miles wide and 100 miles long . In parts of this area , the soil is detectably radioactive as far as six inches down , and the depth of penetration is slowly increasing . <P> Are conditions in this region and in the crater still dangerous to man ? Says Dr Bellamy : " No man knows . No firm answer can be given . " The radioactivity in the crater itself , he thinks , may last two or three hundred years .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
