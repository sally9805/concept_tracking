In Britain Premier Tomasz Arciszewski and the Polish Government in Exile waited for sentence of political death to be passed upon them . Last week it came-the U.S. and Britain recognized the Warsaw Government as the legal government of Poland . Thereby they withdrew recognition from the legal heir of the Polish government for which Britain had gone to war with Germany in 1939 . <P> Wherein had the doomed men failed ? If no better , they were not visibly worse than their Warsaw rivals . Nor were they merely reactionaries , as their enemies often charged-blind upholders of the old ways , the old traditions , the old foundations of Europe 's civilization . Through their underground in Poland and their army ( about 250,000 ) in Italy and elsewhere in Europe , through their intrepid air force , they had waged war against Germany until the end . But history was against them . Their country lay in the onward path of Poland 's traditional enemy , Russia , which now embodied the new revolutionary social forces that were changing old Europe . And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia . Besides , the world was weary of war and wanted to get back to peaceful living . If the Polish Government in Exile stood in the way , it would have to go . <P> Where would the London Poles go to ? Some might go to Canada , some to Brazil . Never , perhaps , would they go home again . For return to Poland would probably mean death or imprisonment for most of them . <P> No doubt the defeated faction should have slipped quietly away . For , like people , governments wish that former friends , whom for one reason or another they have injured , would drop away tactfully . But the London Poles had always been stiff-necked . Perhaps it was political despair , perhaps it was the habit of authority , perhaps it was old-fashioned love of country , which new-fashioned love of class was subtly supplanting through Europe , but the defeated government refused to fold up quietly . It denied that the free elections promised soon by the Warsaw Government would be free in a country governed behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented a majority of the Poles in Poland . It called upon all Poles in the armed forces outside Poland to remain loyal to the Government in Exile . <P> <P> This action probably meant that Britain would cut off the Polish exiles ' financial support except in the case of the Polish armed forces and a few people who would liquidate the affairs of the exiled government . But when everything else was lost , did a stipend matter ?
