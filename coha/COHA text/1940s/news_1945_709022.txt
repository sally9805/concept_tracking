txt Although the number of people drawing down unemployment pay have more than quintupled  --  to a total of 1.7 million  --  since the end of the war , they have scarcely made a dent in the states ' unemployment compensation reserves . Statistics indicate these reserves could withstand more than two years of as much joblessness as the gloomiest prophet can see on the economic horizon . Washington forecasters suggest unemployment next year of around R million . Paying each of these unemployed a total of $400 , a generous estimate of the average annual payment per beneficiary on a national basis , would amount to $3 2 billion . That 's less than half the nearly $7 billion in unemployment reserve funds accumulated over the past seven years ? $5 billion of it during the war years . This principal is steadily increasing through the assessments based on employers ' payrolls and running into the hundreds of millions of dollars annually . In many cases money is still coming into the states faster than it is being paid out . New York State 's Situation Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present outgo of unemployment benefits could be met from current payroll assessments . A total of 128,345 were receiving benefits in this state , according to the latest report . The sevenfold increase in their checks could be accomplished without touching the over $1 billion principal in the state 's fund . A Wall Street Journal survey shows that states have almost an embarrassment of riches in unemployment funds . That 's due to heavy income from payroll assessments during the war and little outgo while unemployment was insignificant . Although heavy rolls of jobless might seem to dictate an economy policy on unemployment funds . states in practice are actually pointed the other way . This is indicated by these two developments : - , ? ? ? 1 . Maximum benefits to unemployed were increased by 25 states and the payment period lengthened by 2S states this year . according to the Council of State Governments . Now , weekly maximum benefits of $20 or more are paid in 27 states . Two states -- Connecticut and Michigan  --  lay out as high as $25 a week . Twelve states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Utah holds first place in this respect with payments of 27 weeks while four states are tied at the 26-week level : Maryland , New Jersey , New York and Washington . 2 . More states are setting up or liberalizing merit ratings which cut down on payroll assessments for unemployment funds . These ratings give credits to employers largely on the basis of their low turnover of employes . The more credits , the less an employer pays . Generally . he gets a percentage reduction on his assessment . In New York state , however , the reduction is in the form of a fiat sum , deductible from the employer 's next payment to the unemployment fund . The maximum unemployment assessment is generally 2 7 , a on wages and salaries in excess of gasmo . Bringing into play the merit rating , this assessment can run as low as 1 o in a typical state  --  like Pennsylvania . The assessment is paid entirely by the employer in all states except four : Alabama . California , New Jersey and nhode Island . These states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employe flow Funds Are ln ? ested The unemployment funds are collected by the states , but held in Washington . The Secretary of the Treasury is required by the provisions of the Social Security Act to invest the funds in excess of the current needs of the states . Ina'estment must be " only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States . " Current investments are in Treasury bonds , notes and special certificates of indebtedness . Interest on Investments goes to each state 's account according to its holdings . New York state is currently being credited with quarterly interest payments of $4 million , Ohio is receiving $2 million interest a quarter which in itself is enough to meet nearly half the state 's outlay in benefits at the September rate of payment . For that month the outgo was nearly $1.5 million ? or . $4.5 million quarterly . One factor that contributes to the maintenance of the current high level of unemployment funds is that many unemployed do n't apply for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs in Ohio fall into this category , according to that state 's Bureau of Unemployment Compensation . Thousands of others in Ohio and elsewhere apply for aid when they are laid off . but they find other jobs before the waiting period on their claims Is satisfied . The waiting period varies from , one to two weeks in the different states except in Maryland where an unemployed person can begin drawing compensation as soon as he files for It . Where workers do n't make any application for unemployment relief , they are often planning an uninterrupted vacation . One consideration imposed by states in granting compensation is that the recipient be ready and able to go to work If the opportunity presents . There are hundreds of thousands of fobs open despite the rising toll of unemployed . Safeguards on Funds Most states have a safeguard against their unemployment funds dropping too low . In Ohio , for example , If the balance in the fund on any September 30 is less than the benefits paid out in the two preceding years . the assessment on employers is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as anyone can see into the future in Ohio and other states , the problem will not be one c ' maintaining funds at a safe minimum level . State after state reports balances beyond anything that it would need short of catastrophe . Pennsylvania was paying out $1.7 million weekly to 87,753 unemployed at the last report . While this was a considerable jump in unemployment outgo over the war years . the balance in the state 's fund had shrunk only a half-million from Its record high of $608 million on August 14 . That peak compared with $208 million on December 7. 1941 . California is paying out on 95,000 claims without reducing Its balance which now totals $734 million , as high as it e%er has been . California , like other states , piled up unemployment funds during the war . At the time of Pearl Harbor , its balance was $200 million . Illinois could afford from its present balance to support 500,000 unemployed for two years and pay each person the maximum payment allowed by that state for the period : $1,040 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state whose unemployment balance is over $500 million . Even Michigan , with the thousands of jobless in Detroit on its hands , is n't being put to any strain . Its unemployment fund stood at nearly $282 milloin on September 30against $294 milion on July 31 when it was at a record peak . The state , et the last report was paying compensation to 170.805 at a rate of $4 million a week and could retain that rate for some 70 weeks even if employer payment to the fund were stopped .
