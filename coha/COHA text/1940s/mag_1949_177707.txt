The Hiss Trial <P> Sir : <P> Your fine story of the Alger Hiss trial TIME , July 18 ... is a credit to American journalism and presents a completely clear picture of the entire case . <P> I believe in fairness and in a fair trial , but I do not believe in ignoring facts . How the four jurors who voted against conviction could choose to ignore those three proven facts of the case is much more than I can understand . What did they want before they voted for conviction ? . . . Maybe some gremlins from the Kremlin used Hiss 's typewriter , without his knowledge , of course . <P> R. R. HORNER JR . <P> Richmond , Va . <P> Sir : <P> . . . Your story on the Hiss trial wrapped the whole subject up for me , after weeks of frustrated wondering what it was all about . . . . Can you tell me why my newspapers quoted so sparely from those summation speeches ? I could make neither head nor tail of the trial from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma <P> Norman , Okla . <P> Sir : <P> . . . Defense Lawyer Stryker may command big fees , but his reputation was not enhanced by all of the blarney which the majority of the jury so easily sensed . Federal Prosecutor Tom Murphy , who draws a small salary for hard work well done , had it over Stryker " like a tent . " His summation was a gem of logical courtroom oratory . By the way ... if Tom had needed help in his argument , he could have called on his brother ( none other than " Fireman " Murphy , ex-Yankee pitcher ) to quench Stryker 's pyrotechnic palaver . . . <P> HUGH CAHILL <P> Cleveland , Ohio <P> Sir : <P> . . . U.S. Attorney Murphy . . . " marshaled his facts impressively .

" Then , later : " Let us suppose one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . We do n't have to get a stomach pump to find out if he 's been eating jam . We have the jam on his face .

Porter . The ceremony took place in the little cabin on the African coast where Tarzan was born , and through it Jane became Lady Greystoke of England , since Tarzan was a nobleman by birth . <P> HENRY HARDY HEINS <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Producer Sol Lesser confessed to TIME 'S Hollywood correspondent : " That 's something we overlooked .
