National Selected Morticians , Inc .. a " professional group " with headquarters in Chicago , considered the atomic age and was appalled . The average undertaker has probably never seen a Geiger counter , but it was obvious that he would soon have to face the problem of radioactive " remains . " In hushed tones , on tiptoe , and with the little finger sympathetically but gracefully extended , as always , Mortuary Science , the magazine of National Selected Morticians , Inc. , prepared the " funeral-service profession " for the worst . <P> It predicted that funeral services for those who have succumbed to the deathly atomic rays would be revolutionized : cremation of highly radioactive remains will be impossible because " radioactive particles . . . certainly would be borne away by the volatile gases . " <P> The magazine cautioned morticians that " no person can remain long near a body that is even slightly radioactive unless he is " protected by lead-lined clothing . " Its projected program for the burial of highly radioactive bodies : " Dispose of them summarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caskets into excavations floored by a copious layer of concrete and then completely surrounding them with more concrete poured to fill the excavations . The graves , of course , would be located in a secluded spot from which the public would forever be barred . " <P> The article gave further instructions : " A team of embalmers working alternately and each exposing himself for only short periods , might complete the embalming process upon remains not dangerously radioactive . Such a body might be exhibited to public view provided the visitors file quickly past the bier . ... " <P> But National Selected Morticians , Inc. made it plain that there was no sense in taking too many chances . Remains that are dangerously radioactive , Mortuary Science concluded , will probably have to be interred by atomic scientists themselves .
