No matter how Oregon went , the returns would not cut much ice at the Philadelphia convention . <P> Ohio was the best proof of that . Though both Harold Stassen and Robert Taft immediately ran out their victory flags , the result of last week 's Ohio primary was a flat standoff . Stassen had picked up only nine of 23 contested delegates-three fewer than he had said he would . Despite Taft 's confident prediction that he would lose but one delegate , he had lost nine in his own home state . <P> Wrote New York Timesman James Reston : " One more ' victory ' like this one would be the undoing of both candidates . " <P> The Stassen bandwagon had not been brought to a bumping stop , but it had at least been slowed down . Taft 's showing was enough to keep him from being knocked out of the running entirely , but it was not good enough to shoot him into the lead . And the best that Tom Dewey could hope to do in Oregon was to recover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nebraska . Actually the primaries had decided nothing : Dewey was still the probable leader on the first ballot , followed by Stassen and Taft . <P> By last week 770 out of 1,094 convention delegates had been picked ( number of votes necessary for nomination : 548 ) . Nearly half of the delegates were either 1 ) undecided , 2 ) pledged to favorite sons , or 3 ) silent . Those who were committed or unofficially pledged made the first ballot score read : Dewey , 202 ; Stassen , 143 ; Taft , 108 . Those who were open to persuasion were talking more &; more about Senator Arthur Vandenberg . <P> Thus the balance of power rested with the uncommitted and favorite-son delegates-and they would not make their final choice until the balloting had begun .
