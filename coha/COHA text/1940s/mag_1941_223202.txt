Last week the Navy stepped up its recruiting goal to 13,000 men per month for the rest of this year , 15,000 per month in 1942 . Object : to have 369,000 enlisted men in two-ocean service by next June 30 . <P> The Navy gets no draftees , requires its regular volunteers to sign up for six-year hitches ( longest Army tour for volunteers : four and one-half years ) . Despite this stiff requirement , the Navy is already doing very well , recruiting at the rate of 10,300 per month . To run this up to 15,000 it is expanding an experiment in small-town newspaper advertising for recruits . Test advertisements in Missouri , Iowa , Indiana doubled the monthly enlistment rate in those States , will soon appear in 13 more States ( Nebraska , Kansas , Kentucky , Maryland , Virginia , West Virginia , North and South Carolina , Georgia , Florida , Alabama , Mississippi , Tennessee ) . But the basic appeal is still the same : see the world .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
