F RY President of the United States , as any- one knows , must constantly face a limited J risk of bodily harm at the hands of some crank or fanatic . But , as almost no one stops to think , the men and women around the President , and especially the Secret Service detail , must ac  --  cept more or less the same risk because they are just as vulnerable to a bullet or a packaged bomb in  --  tended for the Chief Executive . I do n't believe any  --  one around the White House has ever spent much time worrying about his own danger , and especially I do n't believe any President has ever given it more than passing consideration . On the contrary , most Presidents have been scornful of the precautions taken by the Secret Service . Occasionally , however , the risk can not be ignored and , of course , in the past there have been those tragic times when the assassin was successful . Since the beginning of the Second World War the meas  --  ures for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient that modern science could devise , but , as I look back on my fifty years ' service in the White House , I often shudder to re  --  call the risks that were run in earlier years . As Cilia of Mails at the White House , I suppose I took my share of the risks , because cranks are just as likely to use the postal service as any other method of trying to get explosives into the Presi  --  dent 's office . Following the assassination of Presi  --  dent McKinley , I was inclined to be suspicious of everything , and through the years I developed a sort of sixth sense in regard to packages that came unannounced in the White House mail . Sometimes I was right and sometimes I was wrong . Many a time I prodded a package with a stick while holding an improvised shield in front of my  --  self . Many a time I dumped a ticking box into a bucket of oil  --  often ruining a handsome gift clock addressed to the President . Many a time I wrecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventor who thought he was contributing a marvel  --  ous new weapon to our national defense . It is no longer true , but until the time of Franklin Roosevelt the Chief of Mails had to depend largely on instinct and good luck and experience in han  --  dling dangerous packages , because we did n't have the elaborate scientific equipment which is now in  --  stalled in the White House mail room . About the only good thing I can say about the old days is that at least I never lost a President . There were , however , some occasions when I was n't sure whether my luck would last . And there were times that were both exciting and amusing , as the day in 1933 when I was opening President Roosevelt 's mail and came to a package wrapped in brown paper and postmarked from Cleveland , Ohio . To the casual observer it would have seemed to be just an ordinary parcel , except perhaps for the scrawled address : " To the President of the United States . " But to me it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought instinctively , even before I had touched it , something wrong with that irregularhandwriting and the sender 's return address : " Lieut . Jenkins , Cleveland Police . " When I picked up the package there did n't seem to be anything particularly unusual about it , but my suspicions were as strong as before . I held it out to one of my assistants . " Buck , " I said , " what do you think ? " He gave it a Long look , shrugged and said , " I 'd rather you opened it . " I went over and checked the " lookout " file of letters which had come in telling ua to be on the lookout for a package which would arrive later for the President . There was nothing in regard to Cleveland or Lieutenant Jenkins . I decided to try a method I had developed for opening suspicious packages backward . The normal way to open a package is to cut along the top or to untie it and loosen the folded paper . That is also the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to be inside the package . A crude bomb , for instance , might have a match placed so that it would be ignited by friction when the paper is loosened , and thus touch of gunpowder , which , in turn , would explode the bomb . My system was to open the suspicious packages in as nearly as possible the opposite manner . In this instance , I started cutting a hole in the bottom of the package . Under the brown paper I found a stiff cardboard box , and looped through the sides of the box I discovered many small copper wires . That was enough for me . Any package that ticked or had wires inside always got my goat .. and with good reason too . I decided to give Lieu  --  tenant Jenkins ' package the full-dress treatment . My first move was to go to the lobby outside the President 's office , where , as I had expected , I found the inimitable Col. Edmund W. Starling , chief of the White House Secret Service detail , resting com  --  fortably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I think I 've got something of interest to the Secret Service . " The colonel was not a man to pass up the dra  --  matics in any situation . He sat up , tightened his rugged jaw and narrowed his eyes at me . I told him about the package . He made a quick but safe decision . " Let 's soak it , " he said . We took the parcel out into the back yard of the White House , got a bucket of water and dumped it in . Then we went about our business . Twelve hours later we got a couple of long sticks from the base  --  ment and fished the package out of the bucket . Using the poles like elongated chopsticks , and ready to hit the deck at any moment , we began tearing the package to pieces . We smashed the box and disclosed yards of thin copper wire , wound back and forth in an intricate pattern through a queer-looking lump in the middle of the package . We sweated and prodded some more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw down my pole and stepped closer to the mess . " You know what that looks like ? " I asked Starling .

I 'll probably be like the farmer 's balky mule that refused to eat . A neighbor asked how his mule got along without food , to which the farmer replied , " Pretty well , but about the time he got used to going without food , he up and died . " My weight is now down to around ninety pounds . I ca n't help asking myself what traits my best friends possess that have attracted me to them . I do know that many of them are imbued with a love of their fellow man and constantly are thinking of something to do for the other person . I like their attitude too . They rarely say anything bad about anyone ; on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fellow . A lot of folks get more enjoyment out of doing than in having something done for them . This is how it should be . My friends have n't come by their good traits by some magical stroke ; neither did they inherit them . They were de  --  veloped , day by day . I hate to say it , but sometimes the older people become , the more selfish and narrow becomes their outlook . A woman I know worked for the Govern  --  ment for more than thirty-five years . Upon being retired , she came to my office and said she wanted to warn peo  --  ple who worked not to do as she had done . Her concluding remarks were , " All through my working life I 've saved money , always planning on what a good time I would have when my time came to retire . Well , that time has arrived and I 've saved plenty of money but I 've formed habits of saving and economizing , and I 've become selfish along with it . Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do all my life . " Another thing about my friends is the religion they subscribe to . I do n't like to associate religion with creed . Frequently my best friends do not sub  --  scribe to my creed , yet I can not think of a single one whom I do n't consider religious . I suppose one ca n't forget altogether little things that occur to lower a per  --  son in one 's estimation . You can not have lived half a century without find  --  ing people who have not measured up to expectations . I 'll confess that on all too numerous occasions I have not al  --  ways measured up to my own ideals . By the same token I would not want to be judged adversely by my friends be  --  cause of an occasional shortcoming . I 'm at a loss to explain fully why some people are just friends and others are true friends . Of this , however , I am certain : when the nations of the world and individuals who go to make up those nations arrive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a lot of the ills of this world will be corrected and a better world will be in the making . My thoughts frequently are discon  --  nected , yet I ca n't resist the impulse to put them into words . It is n't always easy . " When one is faced with sudden death , he also is reminded of the many sins he has committed . " I 've pondered that remark several times recently , and doubt its truth very much . Besides , I wonder , if all of us had our lives to live over again , just how much better job we would make of it . Oh , I suppose one might change somewhat for the better , but I doubt if there would be much im  --  provement . An attorney who was about to retire had re/axed from everyday work by an occasional fishing outing . Asked what changes he would make in his life if he had the chance to live it again , he re  --  plied , " I would do more fishing . " In these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm not so sure but that it would be a good idea to sub  --  scribe to that practice . I often think of a speech that fre  --  quently is made at the annual reunion of a social fraternity to which I belong . Rising to his full stature , the speaker will begin by saying , " Now , you re  --  member that old poem . It goes like this : ' As we journey through life let us live by the way , and , by the way , let us live . ' " That 's all I remember of the verse , but it 's pretty good philosophy for my money . Too many people live either in the past or the future , and I do n't know which is worse . Would n't it be a fine world if everyone would do all that he could every day to make this a better world in which to live ? One time an attorney asked his Italian client what he did for a living , to which he received this reply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , to buy the food , to getta the strength to digga the ditch . " All too often we get mixed up in that vicious circle . We do n't take the time to do those things in life that would make us more useful , happy citizens in our community circle . It 's well to remember that what one accomplishes in this world is up to him almost entirely . We all have our trials and tribulations , and the way we meet them governs our contribution to im  --  mortality . It all goes back to this point : if you are happy and if you are to con  --  tribute toward making this a better world in which to live , work at it every day . If I had my life to live over again , that is just what I would resolve to do . For a long time my mind has been crowded with thoughts of my family . I have thought of their spiritual , ternporal and physical welfare . Naturally , nothing on earth is quite so dear to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write of anything so purely personal . While journeying through life , nothing contributes quite so much to one 's suc  --  cess and well-being as a happy family life . All through my employed career I 've tried to plan for the future security of my family , in case just such an emergency as this should come along . Peace of mind on that score has meant a lot to me in this tragic hour . An old college professor of mine , a Doctor Green , of whom I always thought a great deal , made this remark on numerous occasions , " A man is only half a success until he has a good wife . " It is the inspiration of a wife and family to which moat men are indebted for any success they may attain . My sug  --  gestion to every father and mother is : stay young and encourage your chil  --  dren to have their friends in the home . The water from the suspended bottle above my head trickles stealthily down through the tube into my arm . The doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live longer than he thought possible . Three weeks ago  --  or has it been longer  --  I was wheeled out of the operating room . I 'm still here , still hungry and still unable to eat . Outside is a lovely , cool day . June is a glorious time of year , be  --  tween the cool of spring and the heat of summer , when all living things take on new life . Perhaps now , while I 'm still in pos  --  session of my normal faculties , would be a good time to close this article . I feel that perhaps I have proffered too much advice . But if this be true , please overlook it . And remember , this was my last chance to speak on a subject brought too close for comfort . MY FIFTY YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE ( Continued from Page 28 ) The colonel shook his head irritably , suggesting that he did n't much care what it looked like . He was getting good and tired of Lieutenant Jenkins ' little parcel . " It looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We took a closer look and it was a sweet potato . The colonel personally confirmed it with a fine outburst of disgust . He bundled the whole works up carefully with the idea of trying to trace the sender . " Well , " he said as he stalked away , " we made a noble effort , however futile . " There was nothing in the package but the wires and a harmless sweet potato . All efforts to trace what must have been a man with a distorted sense of humor failed . We never knew the answer , but it was a long time before we could see anything even faintly amusing in the incident . My only solace was that I had been right  --  there was something wrong with that parcel . The sweet-potato ' bomb " was just part of a day 's work , but we never knew when we might come across something far more serious , and we never took chances . And we had some queer experiences with cranks and with some characters who meant real dan  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packages with visits to the White House . One of the crackpot variety who crashed the White House back in the McKinley Administration was typical of the mental cases who seem harmless enough , but might at any time become fanatical and dangerous . This fellow arrived carrying a bundle made up of branches and weeds , with a Bible nes  --  tled in the center . He insisted that he had to see the President . If he did not , his bundle , which was really a voodoo creation , would bring about many horrors , including the ousting of Mr. McKinley and the election of a king . He could prevent the catastrophes , he added , by explaining to the President that the branches he carried repre  --  sented various political groups and that some of them had to be lopped off . The whole situation could be saved , he went on , by eliminating William Jen  --  nings Bryan from politics  --  an idea that would doubtless have appealed to Mr. McKinley had it been proposed by anyone but a voodoo doctor . A more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a wealthy real-estate man in the Midwest who became well known to us because he was always writing to the President on important issues , about which he apparently knew noth  --  ing . Finally he showed up at our office , confident that the President would be pleased to see him . By that time I had a good idea of his eccentricities and I told Everett Sand  --  ers , the President 's secretary , that I did n't believe he should be received by Mr. Coolidge . Sanders , however , checked up and found that the caller was a wealthy man , and he remained on the engagement list . I then went around to Dick Jervis , head of the White House Secret Service detail , and told him it would be a good idea to keep his eyes open . The gentleman arrived and was taken to the door of the President 's office at the appointed time . Every  --  thing was going fine . But as he stepped forward to shake the President 's out  --  stretched hand , the silence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cascade of pleasant but startling little tunes that seemed simply to emanate from the person of the visitor . Mr. Coolidge stepped back quickly be  --  hind his desk , aghast . Jervis pounced . When they got the fellow back in our office  --  still without shaking hands with the President  --  he began taking little music boxes out of every pocket of his suit . They were beautiful golden boxes which , he said proudly , cost $400 each . He lined them up on a desk and played them for the clerks , pleased with the attention he was getting . He did n't , however , get any attention from the President . Mr. Coolidge was not amused . Another strange new centered around an old German who lived in New York . He wrote to the President in German on many occasions , and there was an intriguing childlike simplicity about his letters . I always read the transla  --  tions carefully , especially after he be  --  gan telling us about his domestic trou  --  bles in letters that were like install  --  ments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl almost starving on the street and had taken her home . Apparently he mistook her gratitude for love , but in any event they were married . Then , after a short time , his letters said the girl had started looking around for youth and fun . Finally she left him . It was a terrible blow to the old man , and it was clear from later letters that it preyed on his mind constantly . His business was neglected and failed . He walked the streets . He was hungry . He was a bum , and he still wrote to the President about it . One day he appeared at the White House and , since I knew about his let  --  ters , I talked to him through an inter  --  preter . He said he had been sitting in the park across the street , hungry and tired , and not daring to come to see the President . He wandered , dazed , into a restaurant and somebody asked him a question . He did n't understand , but he answered " Ja @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . After eating , he got up enough nerve to come in and tell us that his wife was persecuting him and he wanted the President to help him . I told him that the President had given orders that he was to be looked after . Following the usual routine , he was sent to St. Elizabeth 's , as he was obviously a mental case by that time . He was pleased and grateful . When I went there , later , on other business , he rushed up to shake my hand and thank me for the magnificent accommoda  --  tions the President had given him . On several occasions persons who had written to the President and then followed up their letters with visits to the White House were so far off balance that they threatened to act violently , but we usually had police help at band to subdue them . There was one ( Continued on Page 88 ) ( Continued f Page 86 ) Rumanian-born citizen who wrote to President Hoover in regard to the handling of our relations with Ru  --  mania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he made various pro  --  posals for improvement , all of which were so wild that we were very much on the alert when he finally showed up in person . I arranged for assistance to be near by when I talked to him . He was im  --  patient and wanted to see Mr. Hoover , but I explained that the President was so busy that an interview could not be arranged . I pointed out all the clerks in the office and said that it was their duty to relieve the President of some of the burdens of office . Suddenly our visitor 's attitude changed . He said he agreed with me . He shook hands warmly and departed . The next week he was back . " I just dropped in to shake hands , " he ex  --  plained . We shook hands warmly . He was very jolly . He came in about once a week for several months and we shook hands . Finally , after a warm shake , he showed me a passport visaed for Ru  --  mania . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done from that end , and I guess he did , because I never saw him again . One other intriguing case lasted for many years . President Theodore Roose  --  velt received a letter from an American woman who was married to a Euro  --  pean count , saying that the United States ambassador at one of the Euro  --  pean capitals had , because of jealousy , blocked her presentation at court . She wanted the ambassador fired . She did n't get any satisfaction , but she kept on writing long letters to the President and we formed the opinion that she was suffering from some delusion . Anyway , nothing was done other than to refer her letters to the Department of State . Then one day she turned up at the White House and wanted to talk to the President . When we heard that she had arrived , we were merely amused , but when she came into the office we could only stare at her . She was one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen , and she was dressed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion magazine . One of the President 's secretaries took a look at her and left the lobby at a rapid pace , explaining that he was afraid that if he talked to her he would end up by giving her the United States Mint and joining the royalist party . A newspaper reporter who knew the story of her letters refused to write about her because he said he would be sure to end up with an editorial backing her complaint . She finally departed without seeing the President and without achieving anything but an office sensation , but we kept on getting letters from her for years . The ambassador retired . Mr. Roosevelt was out of office and finally died . But the countess kept right on writing to the President , always with the same complaint . We were frequently reminded that so-called crank cases could be full of political dynamite . One such case con  --  cerned the mentally unbalanced wife of a congressman . She demanded that the President prosecute some absurd claim against her husband , and finally had to be led , screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She later publicly charged that she had been thrown out of the White House , and newspapers all over the country published her story , permitting the ad  --  ministration 's political foes to make capital of the case . The White House is always the tar  --  get of so many cranks that it is some  --  times difficult to know when the Presi  --  dent might be in real danger . Crude bombs made of lead pipe have been found in the White House mail , but they were comparatively easy to de  --  tect and destroy . Sometimes , however , we were lucky to recognize less obvious explosive packages . In the Hoover Administration , we received a slim little box addressed to the President , but with no indication of the name of the sender . I did n't like the looks of it and I opened it back  --  ward , finding a fountain pen inside . I still thought it was peculiar that any  --  one would send Mr. Hoover a fountain pen without identifying himself , so I put it to soak in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking off the cap of the pen . Inside the rubber ink container was a high explosive . When I unscrewed the cap , I found the oil-soaked head of a Fourth of July sparkler and a sprinkling of powder , so placed that it was intended to cause an explosion when the cap was unscrewed . We were always suspicious of pack  --  ages which ( lid not carry the sender 's name or address , and especially of gifts of candy . We could test most food packages , but candy was destroyed un  --  less we could be sure of the identity of the sender and knew that the package had not been tampered with . I always worried about gifts of liquids , too , and kept only those that could be tested . That meant I had the sad duty of de  --  stroying a lot of champagne , because even with scientific methods I have never found a way of testing cham  --  pagne without opening the bottle and therefore ruining it . The number of threatening letters to the Presidents has had little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad times there is likely to be an increase , as during the last part of Mr. Hoover 's Administration . Presumably this is due to worries which cause more and more persons to resort to extreme measures . One of the common types of threatening letter , for instance , is that from some person who states his own desperate economic plight and says that unless " something is done " to solve his personal situation he will commit an act of violence . There was a sharp renewal of crank letters after the start of the second World War , largely sent by persons with fanatical views on international affairs . This trend continued after the death of F.D.R. , and Mr. Truman re  --  ceived threatening letters as a retult of intense feeling over postwar foreign developments . Nobody could guess which threats were the work of mere cranks and which might be serious , but no chances were taken . Fortunately , we were tipped off to a lot of letters before they were re- ceived , and the Secret Service was able to keep watch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not uncommon for some responsible citizen to advise the White House that he had learned of a threatening letter which is being sent to the President or that he had heard about a threat to the safety of the Chief Executive . One letter in the nature of a warning , but perhaps merely the work of a crank , was forwarded to us by the mayor of a large city . It said that an attempt would be made on the life of President Truman at the Army-Navy football game . It is customary at the game for the President to sit on the Army side of the field during one half and on the Navy side of the field dur  --  ing the other half , walking across the gridiron between halves . That walk , the letter said , would be the last walk ever taken by Mr. Truman . The Secret Service could not relate the letter to any previous crank com  --  munications and , of course , took the most elaborate precautions . Men were stationed at frequent and strategic spots in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gridiron be  --  tween halves with a smile and a confi  --  dent step , but a lot of other men close to him did n't breathe easy until the game was over . On another occasion I was sum  --  moned back to Washington from my vacation in the summer of 1947 be  --  cause controversy over important issues , including the Palestine ques  --  tion , had greatly increased the volume of mail to the President . I was rather surprised that the volume should be more than could be handled rout inely by the office , but when I got back I found that not all of the difficulty was due to volume . Some of the letters received had obviously been intended to kill . There bad been a flurry in England in June of that summer because eight or more government officials and political  --  cal personages had received terrorist letters in which explosives were clev  --  erly concealed . Among those who got such ' letters were Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin , Colonial Secretary Ar  --  thur Creech Jones , President of the Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cripps ' secretary noticed that the letter he received was hot  --  police said later it apparently was about ready to explode  --  and he stuck it in water . Eden carried his letter unopened In his brief case for twenty-four hours before a secretary , tipped off by po  --  lice , found it . There were two envelopes , the outer one about eight by six inches and cream-colored . The inner envelope was marked " Private and Confidential , " presumably in an effort to see that it was opened by the man to whom it was addressed . Inside the second envelope was powdered gelignite , a pencil bat  --  tery and a detonator arranged to ex  --  plode when the envelope was opened . Police exploded one experimentally and said that it was powerful enough to kill a man . The so-called Stern gang ' of Pales  --  tine terrorists later claimed responsi  --  bility for having sent the letters from its " branch in Europe . " The letters were postmarked from Italy . Terrorist letters of the same kind were found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result , the staff had been handling all letters with great care , thus slowing up the routine . As far as 1 know , none of those received in this country resulted in an explosion , which may have been due to the ex  --  cellent system introduced for han  --  dling the White House mail during the war . This system makes full use of all modern scientific methods . When it was installed after consultation with many experts , the Secret Service turned over to me a fluoroscope and X-ray machine and arranged for clerks in the receiving room to be trained in the technique of handling explosives . All food packages , unless their origin was favorably known and there was no possibility of tampering , were ordered sent to the Food and Drug laboratory , where scientific tests were conducted before any package was sent to the White House kitchen . Even the food which is purchased daily for the White House was placed under special supervision . Secret Serv  --  ice men pick up all groceries which are ordered , and they watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the food purchased to a special truck , lock it in and deliver it directly to the kitchen . All packages which come in the White House mail are examined under the fluoroscope , which shows up any dense material , particularly metal . If we do not know in advance what the package contains , any parcel contain  --  ing metal , especially clockworks , is put under the X ray . This may show suffi  --  cient detail to prove that it is harmless . But if , after examination by the bomb-detection experts , it is found to be dan  --  gerous , the package is turned over to the See t Service and placed in a spe cially built bomb trailer . The trailer looks like a huge urn and is constructed of twisted wire cables and mounted on two wheels . The heavy cables never have been tried with an atomic bomb , but there is no question that they are strong enough to with  --  stand a very powerful explosion . The trailer is then attached to an armored car , an extremely heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bomb or suspected bomb is then taken to a special testing ground where final disposition is made by the Secret Service experts . The details of bomb disposition are the business of the Secret Service , and I would not want to discuss their meth  --  ods in any way that might interfere with their operations . The disposition , however , is quite definite and perma  --  nent . The routine handling of crank letters is also highly developed now , and the Secret Service is likely to become ac  --  quainted with the writers in a hurry . When such a letter is found by one of the staff that reads the White House mail , it immediately goes into a spe cial category , which includes any letter that is threatening , obscene or sug  --  gests that the writer is mentally un  --  balanced . The reader marks it for the Secret Service and puts his own initials on it . It is then stamped  --  both the en  --  velope and stationery  --  in the dating machine and placed in a large cello  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office of Pro  --  tective Research , which is a branch of the regular Secret Service under the Treasury Department and has its offices in the east wing of the White House executive office . There each let  --  ter is photographed , processed , ana  --  lyzed and indexed . This means that the letter is checked for fingerprints  --  other than those of the staff reader , which are on file the handwriting is studied and a record is made of all the characteristics of the letter . About half of such letters are anony  --  mous , but in any event the character  --  istics of each are checked against an elaborate file to see whether it is a first letter or a repeater . If it is a first letter and if it is only mildly annoying , it is unlikely that any action will be taken . The letter is merely filed for future reference . But if it is a repeater or a particularly threatening letter , a photo  --  stat probably will be sent to a field agent in the community from which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Secret Service usually gets in touch with him or his relatives and secures a promise  --  often broken  --  not to write again . But if the writer is anonymous , the Secret Service usually can chase him down , especially if he is a repeater . One man who had lost his job in a paper mill and wrote threatening let  --  ters to Mr. Hoover was trailed on an automobile trip from Cleveland to the West Coast and back through the Northern states to Chicago , dropping a trail of letters all the way . He man  --  aged to keep one jump ahead of the agents until he got to Chicago , where the trail seemed to end . The Secret Service did n't stop , how  --  ever . They checked every paper mill in the area , found a man who seemed to meet their description , trapped him into writing a note which matched the handwriting of the threatening letters and arrested him . Perhaps three or four letters a week are received at the White House from persons who either directly threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who say they are m such desperate straits that unless the President helps them they will kill themselves . In such instances , tele  --  grams are sent at once to the nearest Secret Service field agent , giving him full information or referring to previous letters if the writer is already on file and therefore well known to the field agent . The agent then moves in with the aid of postal inspectors , local au  --  thorities and whatever other agencies are available . Of course , sometimes the Secret Service fails to locate an anonymous correspondent . One woman in Santa Monica , California , wrote a number of letters to President Truman . They were literate and neatly written let  --  ters , but they threatened Mr. Truman with various unpleasant fates . The woman seemed likely to be harmless , but she was a persistent soul and the Secret Service hunted her in vain for months . Never did find her . Or at least they had n't found her up to the summer of 1998 , when I decided that fifty-one years was enough time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail . There 'd been quite a few times between 1897 and 1948 when I was a bit fearful that somebody would retire me involuntarily , but in the end I made it under my own power .

There are thirteen lemons on the little tree I planted in the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oranges should be large enough to eat . There is only one rule that is en  --  forced at our house these days . My wife has to open all the mail .
