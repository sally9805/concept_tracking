Proud , tubby little Andy Varipapa , at 53 the oldest man in the tournament , liked to puff out his gorilla chest and announce that he is the world 's greatest bowler ( TIME , May 5 ) . A good many of the experts disagreed . They would rather bet their money on glum , gum-chewing Joe Wilman , 41 , who was bowling man of the year in 1946 and went about his trade in very businesslike fashion . In Chicago 's drafty Madison Street Armory last week , Andy and Joe staged a seesaw duel that made the bowling experts forget anything they had seen before . <P> It was the National Individual Match Game Championship . Unlike the mammoth A.B.C . tourney ( in which 18,000 entrants compete ) , this was for the nation 's 168 best bowlers . Only the strongest survived the 100-game grind . Halfway through , thumbs and middle fingers began to swell . In the " bowlers ' paddock " in the armory 's basement , liniment was rubbed-on sore left legs and left hips . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wilman pushed into the lead by a fraction of a point . The crowd roared when the pins went down . A local boy , he was the crowd 's choice . <P> Wilman worked calmly . He is what the trade calls a " spot bowler . " Starting from the right of the alley , he takes four precise steps and fires for the one-three pocket . He once had one three-game score of 811 . But this time he could not shake off Andy . The lead changed hands 14 times . <P> Each time Andy got ahead there were cries , " You 're lucky , Andy . " The crowd was n't really against Andy : it was just that he was fun to badger . Twice , trying to knock down a lone pin , he committed the amazing error of guttering the ball , like any Thursday-night office league dub . The crowd jeered . Not until Wilman 's last ball was bowled was the championship decided . Joe needed a strike to win , and left the tenpin standing . <P> Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line before the crowd , asking triumphantly : " Who said I was n't a man ? I 'm a man , huh ? I 'm a man . " Even the experts had to agree ; he had made a good case for himself as 1948 's Bowler of the Year .
