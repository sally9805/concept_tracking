ON the second of April , 1925 , D. C. Stephenson was arrested . It is almost impossible now , twenty years later , to recall how incredible that seemed . David C. Stephenson , Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana , had said with reason , " I am the law in Indiana . " Less than a year earlier the Klan had won political control of the state . It claimed a membership of nearly half a million . On occasion it took over good-sized cities to hold its awesome parades , it burned its fiery crosses almost nightly , it made the laws in Indiana and it enforced them . Its ruler was D. C. Stephenson , a man probably without precise counterpart in American history . But a determined outraged father , George Oberholtzer , swore out a warrant for the arrest of Stephenson , charging him with assaulting Madge Oberholtzer . Twelve days later Madge Oberholtzer died and the charge became first-degree murder . With this indictment began the end of Indiana 's experiment in homegrown dictatorship . By a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue and smite immorality , was brought to trial for a crime involving gross moral turpitude ; and his victim was described as an innocent girl helpless in his powerful clutches , one who could be regarded as symbolic of Indiana 's electorate during Stephenson 's reign , In her violent death were crystallized most of the conflicting social forces of Indiana in the postwar twenties , a picture with import for today . Madge Oberholtzer was the daughter of a thoroughly respectable family in Irvington , an upper middle-class section of Indianapolis . Her father was in the railroad mail service . She had attended Butler College in Irvington and a business school and she had taught in a rural school and done secretarial work for a couple of Indianapolis business houses before going to work " at the Statehouse , " as her father put it . Indianapolis is the capital of a state where interest in politics runs high ; the Statehouse is Mecca for ambitious folk of all kinds . Madge worked for the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and in the fall of 1924 she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which furnished schoolbooks to rural people without access to a library . At this time she was a girl of twenty-eight , unmarried . She once had been engaged but " the young man had to go to the war . " She was five feet four inches tall , weighed about 145 pounds , and her father testified , " I do n't think there ever was a more healthy-looking girl than she was . " She wore her dark brown hair fashionably up in the back and rolled so me . He said he was the law in Indiana . " They took her into the compartment ( or drawing room ) and Gentry climbed into the upper berth , she said in her deathbed statement . " Stephenson took hold of the bottom of my dress and pulled it up over my head . I tried to fight but was weak and unsteady . . . . What I had drunk was affecting me . Stephenson took all my clothes off and pushed me into the lower berth . After the train had started Stephenson got in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not move . I . . do not remember all that happened . . . He . . . bit my neck and face . . . and mutilated me all over my body . " p-p rIE next thing she remembered was be- ing wakened next morning . " Stephenson was flourishing his revolver . I said to him to shoot me . . . . Gentry and Stephenson helped me dress and the two men dressed and they took me off the train at Hammond , " about 6:15 A.M. , just before the train crossed the state line into Illinois . They walked the block from the depot to the four-storey Indiana Hotel . Stephenson was wearing a cap , a pair of laced boots , khaki trousers , and a closely fitting black sweater . He needed a shave . Madge " had no make-up on " and appeared pale . The party was assigned to Rooms 416 and 417 , adjoining rooms but without a connecting door . In Room 416 Stephenson gave the bellhop a half-dollar and ordered breakfast . The boy left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . He dictated it : " We are driving through to Chicago will take train back tonight , " and Gentry said he would send it . " Stephenson lay down on the bed and slept . Gentry put hot towels and witch hazel on my head and bathed my body to relieve my suffering . . . . " Stephenson wakened and " said he was sorry , and that he was three degrees less than a brute . I said to him , ' You are worse than that . ' " The bellhop brought up their breakfast and Stephenson , standing shirtless beside Madge , who sat dazed on the edge of the bed , tipped him a dollar . Stephenson ate heartily : grapefruit , coffee , sausage , buttered toast ; Madge only drank coffee . Stephenson 's chauffeur , " Shorty , " came in ; he had driven Stephenson 's car up from Indianapolis . " I said to Stephenson to give me some money , that I had to buy a hat . Shorty gave me $15.00 at Stephenson 's direction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small black silk hat for $12.50 . Then " I said to Shorty to drive me to a drug store in order that I might get some rouge . We drove to a drug store near the Indiana Hotel and I purchased a box of bichloride of mercury tablets . I put these in my coat pocket . Then we went back to the hotel . " The men got some more liquor at Stephenson 's direction , and Madge asked permission to go into Room 417 to rest . Stephenson said , " ' Oh no . . . you are going to lie right down here by me . ' I waited a while until I thought he was asleep , then I went into Room 417 alone . There was no glass in Room 417 so I got a glass in 416 . . . . I laid out eighteen of the bichloride of mercury tablets and at once took six of them . I only took six because they burnt me so . " Previously she had purloined Stephen-son 's revolver , but she abandoned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her mother . Now she lay down on the bed " and became very ill . . . vomited blood all day . " Not until nearly 4 P.M. did anyone come to see her ? Shorty . She told him she had taken poison and adjured him not to tell Stephenson . " . . . he turned pale . . . . He then went out . In a few minutes Stephenson and Gentry and Shorty came into the room very much excited . Stephenson said ' What have you done ? ' " She told him . He made her drink a quart of milk and told her they would have her stomach pumped at a hospital , where she could register as his wife . " I refused to do this as his wife . " Stephenson said he would take her home . She refused to go . " Stephenson said that the best way out of it was for us to drive to Crown Point and for us to get married . . . . I refused . Stephenson snapped his fingers and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped me downstairs . I did not care what happened to me . " On the 175-mile drive to Indianapolis they removed the license plates . " All the way back to Indianapolis I suffered great pain and agony and screamed for a doctor . . . . They refused to stop . I begged and said to Stephenson to leave me along the road some place . . . . Stephenson . . . said he thought I was dying . . . . I heard him say also that he had been in a worse mess than this before and got out of it . Stephenson and Gentry drank liquor during the entire trip . I remember Stephenson having said that he had power and saying he had made $250,000 . He said that his word was law . " They reached Stephenson 's house in Irvington Iate that night , and Madge 's mother was at the door . One of them stalled her and they concealed Madge in the loft above the garage . Stephenson told Madge , " You will stay right here until you marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning when , about eleven o'clock , Klenck took her home . He carried her into her house and put her on a bed . Coming downstairs alone , he met a woman , Eunice H. Schultz , who lived with the Oberholtzers . Klenck told her Madge had been injured in an automobile accident . She asked him who he was and he said , " ' My name is Johnson , from Kokomo . . . . I must hurry . . . . " Upstairs , Madge " was groaning , very pale , could hardly speak . . . . She said , Oh I am dying , Mrs. Schultz . ' " Her parents , who had been out hunting her , returned home and called the family physician , Dr. John Kingsbury . They already had consulted their attorney , Asa J. Smith ; it was he who had driven Mrs. Oberholtzer to Stephenson 's home the night before , hunting the girl , and it was he who later took from Madge the dying declaration that wrecked the Klan in Indiana . Several physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfusion . But she died April 14th , and her father charged Stephenson , Gentry , and Klenck with murder . T o understand what happened to Madge Oberholtzer it is necessary to know something of the context of the crime . The postwar mood , gin parties , " the desperate game of politics , " charges of frame-up and corruption , lawlessness inhigh places , the struggle that accompanies the attempt to impose a dictatorship on a body politic ? all these were threads in Indiana 's social fabric in the twenties , and they were vital factors in the crime upon Madge Oberholtzer . And they all were bound up with the amazing career of D. C. Stephenson . His origin is clouded . Probably he was born in Texas in 1891 and spent some of his boyhood in Oklahoma . He was a printer 's apprentice . He was commissioned a second lieutenant during the 1917-18 war but apparently never saw service overseas . Beautiful women were important in his life ( he married at least two before he was thirty ) . Honorably discharged from military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took up his life work . Now the original Ku Klux Klan , organized in 1865 by bored Civil War veterans and perverted into an instrument of Negro terrorization , was dead by 1872 . ( The postwar aspect is significant . ) The Klan of the 1920 's owed its name , its regalia , and some of its outlandish terminology to the Reconstruction Klan , though its tenets were those of Know Nothingism . Founded in Georgia in 1915 by Colonel William J. Simmons , the modern Klan did n't amount to much until after the war , when two press agents took it in hand in 1920 ; but after the original leaders were replaced by Hiram Wesley Evans , a Dallas dentist who as Imperial Wizard was by turns D. C. Stephenson 's mentor and his implacable enemy , Klan membership rose to an estimated six million in 1924 . That year the tide of the national Invisible Empire reached high water mark . The date coincides precisely with the high water mark of Stephenson 's own career in Indiana . Indiana ? perhaps because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertile ground for the Klan . Postwar disillusionment favored its growth , but so did other conditions . There was the boredom of the small towns . There was the old tradition of intolerance ? forty years ago or more you could hear whispers that every Catholic church was an arsenal and built on a hilltop to command its town with firepower , and you could see roadside signs at village outskirts : " Nigger , Do n't Let the Sun Set on You Here . " Indiana should have been a melting pot : to its northern steel mills came Europeans , to its southern hills came the Kentuckians driven there by the Night Riders during the tobacco wars ; to its towns and cities came men of all races and religious beliefs . But the mixture never quite melted : the old stiff-backed yeomanry , the farmers and the small-town merchants , were set in their ways , resentful of outsiders . And now of course in 1920 the postwar scramble for jobs was on , with foreigners and Negroes competing with returning veterans . Hoosiers were sick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Any organization sworn to uphold hearth and fireside and womanly virtue , " Americanism " and law and order , was assured of welcome . The Klan waged righteous war on Bolsheviks , Catholics , Jews , Negroes , bootleggers , pacifists , evolutionists , foreigners , and all persons whom it considered immoral . It worked closely with the potent Anti-Saloon League and it revived the moribund Horse Thief Detective Association , which became the Klan enforcement arm ? a formidable vigilante organization that entered private homes without warrant and got to be the bane of petting parties on lonely country roads . When D. C. Stephenson first came to Evansville he set about organizing the war veterans , an activity which , he said , inevitably led Mm into politics . It led him to enter the 1920 congressional primary as a wet Democrat . The Anti-Saloon League licked him ; he promptly became bone-dry and Republican , and he joined the burgeoning Klan , accompanied by his beloved veterans . He was a personable man and an eloquent speaker . In 1922 Hiram W. Evans , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klan in Indiana , and before long he added twenty other states , from Maine to Nebraska . For a time Stephenson maintained headquarters at Columbus , Ohio , but soon he moved to Indianapolis , where meanwhile he had gone into the coal and gravel business . He sold Klan memberships for ten dollars each , of which he kept about four dollars . The white robes and peaked caps , manufactured for $1.10 , cost the members from five to ten dollars . In eighteen months , it was estimated , Stephenson made between two and five million dollars . He hired full-time organizers , some of them stock-and-bond salesmen or Florida real-estate promoters , and he encouraged rank-and-file Klansmen to obtain new members by giving them a split , sometimes as much as six dollars , of the initiation fee extracted from each " alien " admitted to the Invisible Empire . Among his most diligent proselytizers were Protestant clergymen . People of all kinds joined eagerly ? power-hungry ward-heelers and men from the criminal classes , prominent business men and bankers . The prime characteristic of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was secrecy . Your next-door neighbor might be a Klansman and you never would know it even after an application for membership had been mailed to you at his instigation . Nv - HERE was the Klan 's strength ? At bottom , it lay in the minds of the men in the towns and the small cities , in their drab lives and boredom , in their bigotry , in their love of mysticism . The Klan had more than the usual amount of the abracadabra common to secret orders . It suited the Hoosiers fine . The Klaverns might meet once a week , the local leaders might meet almost nightly . Many of their meetings of course were simply poker sessions in the clubroom above the store overlooking the square , excuses to get away from their wives for an evening ; but many were more serious . Every now and then posters would appear mysteriously on telephone poles at rural crossroads , posters announcing a Konklave , or a Klavalcade , a parade . At the appointed time , usually just at dusk , the robed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small cities on the Indiana plains . They came from miles around . In orderly procession they marched into town , and the street intersections were patrolled by brother Klansmen who had usurped the police function . Why could they get away with this ? Simply because they were in truth the law . The mayor was Klan-elected ; so were the city councilmen ; so were the sheriff and the prosecutor . No one viewing a parade could laugh at the Klan 's absurd posturings . There were hundreds , perhaps thousands , of marching men , all clad in white from head to foot ; no music , no leaders , no flags , nothing but silent men marching in the dusk ? that and a silent , awed crowd of onlookers . Through the town they moved , perhaps passing pointedly the Negro district or the home of the Catholic bishop , and on out to the side of the country road where , in the gloom of the evening , they set up their wooden cross on a hillside , soaked it with kerosene , and fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new members who , kneeling before this blazing symbol of terror , swore secrecy and obedience until death . The Klan spread like a grass fire . It is to the credit of Indiana newspapers that they did not support or condone it . But they dared not fight it ; it was running the state before they knew it ; and men who were not members ? not only Negroes or Catholics but also , for example , Protestant business men vulnerable to boycott ? genuinely feared it . By 1924 it claimed from a quarter- to a half-million members , more than a tenth of Indiana 's total population , and the cities were organized block by block , the counties road by road . III TN 1923 Indiana was humiliated when its IL governor , Warren T. McCray , was convicted in federal court of using the mails to defraud . He was sentenced to ten years in Atlanta penitentiary ? the first American governor so convicted . Today it is generally conceded that Mc-Cray was the innocent victim of the postwar deflation in farmland values . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction as proof of his charge of corruption in high places . The duty of the Klan was plain : to purify , to purge , Indiana politics . Stephenson set about this task assiduously . According to a deposition filed much later , the former Exalted Cyclops of the South Bend Klavern said that a former Indiana Grand Dragon told him that the Klan was building a political machine to control the United States ; that the Klanstuffed ballot boxes and used " a lot of money and whisky " to elect a mayor of Evansville ; that one of the Klan 's leading up-lifters was " the fastest man with a gun in the state of Indiana " ; that " we planned to extract Catholicism from the schools as a dentist would extract teeth " ; that at least one local . Klavern broke up when the Klabee , or treasurer , could not account for the funds ; that Stephenson planned to make Protestant ministers in each county salaried Klan members ; that Klansmen who had been planted on every newspaper in one of the state 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorials and news stories before publication . Thus , while the rank and file played ghost , their leaders had more serious aims : money and political power . They got both . At the height of his career Stephenson maintained an expensive yacht , a hotel suite and a palatial home , offices in two cities , a fleet of expensive cars , and an armed bodyguard . He owned interests in various business enterprises , including a tailoring company . He gave clothing to various public officials , from policemen to the governor . He performed favors for his friends . Did a Knight who was a chiropractor by day want to get his profession legalized ? Stephenson would put a bill through the legislature . The legislature was considering a bill that would abolish Madge Oberholtzer 's job ; Stephenson killed it for her . He could be a man of the people when he chose . On summer evenings when he drove through his realm he would park his Cadillac slantwise at the curb on the square and chat about crops with the Klavern leaders who left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the running board . But he also moved in a fast circle in the capital city , a circle of cocktail parties in hotel suites and dinner parties atop the hotel roof above the city , a circle that met in a smoke-filled room when the legislature was in session . A circle , in short , which he must have denounced many times in flaming speeches to the rank and file in the country districts . And he also could be spectacular . When , two years after he joined the . Klan ( his phenomenal career was surprisingly brief ) , he assumed office as Grand Dragon of the Realm of Indiana on July 4 , 1923 , he arranged at Kokomo the greatest Konklave ever held in Indiana . After all the Knights had assembled ( two hundred thousand strong , he later estimated ) he swooped down from the sky in a gilded airplane , quite a sight in those days . He stepped from his plane clad in resplendent robes and pledged his unfaltering leadership , and when he departed majestically the hysterical multitude threw at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricks . He called himself the foremost mass psychologist of his time , a claim that can not be dismissed lightly , and he kept before his desk a bust of Napoleon . His ambition was to be President of the United States . He had his eye on the Senate seat of Sam Ralston , whose health was failing fast in 1924 , and on the 1928 Republican presidential nomination . Who dares say with certainty that he would have failed ? No one laughed when he explained to the throng at Kokomo that he was late because he had been consulting with President Harding on high matters of state nor when , frequently , he kept callers at his office waiting on the pretext of speaking long distance with the White House . H Avnw built his organization , Stephenson led it into the political campaign of 1924 . Already he had made deals with some of the bosses . The Klan crossed party lines . It voted for its own members and its friends , whether Democrats or Republicans . But by and large the Klan won power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were already in control of Indiana and Stephenson , instead of trying to lick ' em , joined ' em . Before the polls had been open long on that primary day in May of 1924 , it was apparent that something new had come into Indiana politics . The professionals had known earlier that Klan leaders were making up their slates in secret , but the slates were not given to the Klan rank and file until primary morning , and nobody really knew the strength of the Klan nor where it stood , for there had been rumors that Stephenson had quarreled with Hi-ram Evans and other national Klan leaders . " As the day wore on it appeared that political affiliations were being disregarded and that the contests in many precincts had become an out-and-out Klan and anti-Klan fight . " Clearly the Klan was supporting Ed Jackson ( Republican ) for Governor and Captain George V. Coffin for Marion County Republican Chairman . When the votes were counted it was demonstrated that Stephenson dominated the Republican party . But only four days after the primary it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The leaders claimed he was banished from the Klan for conduct " unbecoming a Klansman " and involving a manicurist . Stephenson said he had resigned earlier because he did n't like the way the national , leaders stirred up religious and racial hatred and used women to frame their political enemies on Mann Act charges . Stephenson also said blandly that he had organized his old army associates into a political group to try to prevent Evans from gaining control of Indiana . At any rate , after the primary the fight between Stephenson and Evans came into the open , and they remained bitter enemies thenceforward . On April 17 , 1924 , that is to say , " on the Deadly Day of the Weeping Week of the Appalling Month of the Year of the Klan LVII , " His Lordship H. W. Evans , Imperial Wizard , had signed an edict ordering the Evansville Klavern Number One to try Stephenson and had addressed it to " All Genii , Grand Dragons and Hydras , Great Titans and Furies , Giants , King Kleagles and Kleagles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Invisible Empire , in the name of the valiant and venerated dead . " Could such stuff be taken seriously ? Indeed , it was the opening of a fight for big stakes , involving ultimately perhaps the fate of the nation . Four days after the primary Stephenson called his suspension " a huge joke . " But he fought back . To Cadle Tabernacle at Indianapolis he summoned Klansmen from every Indiana county in an effort to sever the Indiana realm from the " domination " of Evans civil law practice , ever was active in Klan affairs or Indiana politics . On cross-examination Stephenson 's attorneys charged Smith with attempting to blackmail Stephenson with the dying declaration . Smith denied it flatly , and Stephenson 's lawyers presented no corroborative evidence . But was it possible that Smith was made an innocent party to the " conspiracy " ? That would mean that Madge Oberholtzer 's dying declaration was not true . This Stephenson 's partisans charged . A booklet published in his behalf in 1940 attacked the dying declaration at various points . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Again , although " terrified " and " very ill , " she was able to note such details as the fact that Stephenson 's revolver was pearl-handled , but did not recall that the Pullman porter ( as he testified ) brought sandwiches to the compartment . The newspapers reported she bought the hat and the bichloride of mercury at stores in the hotel building , which she would not logically have used a car to reach , as she said she did ( and it is a curious fact that the state introduced no witnesses to testify they had sold her either poison or a hat ) . The pamphlet questioned , among other things , whether in those days in Indiana a woman of the virtue claimed for Madge Oberholtzer would have gone voluntarily to a bachelor 's home at ten o'clock at night , whether she could have been " forced " to take three drinks , whether she would have gone unguarded from the hotel room where her abductor slept to an adjoining room to take poison instead of escaping , whether she would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room without seeking aid . The pamphlet ended by suggesting that the whole dying declaration presented to the jury was not the document Madge signed but was a substituted document , written by Stephen-son 's enemies who forged Madge 's signature to it . Nevertheless , Judge Will M. Sparks admitted the declaration and said , " Its credibility and weight are wholly for the jury . " One must remember that , when she made it , Madge Oberholtzer was in pain and she was dying . Of course Madge 's statement was not subject tocross-examination . ( Stephenson or his partisans have hinted that the woman he took to Hammond was not Madge Oberholtzer but " the wife of a prominent state official . " ) But the question of Stephenson 's guilt involves broader issues . For certainly this was no ordinary murder case ? that is , death did not immediately follow the act of violence charged , and indisputably Madge took a deadly poison by her own hand . This raised the question : what , precisely , killed the girl ? The state 's medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Stephen-son 's bites , that she would have recovered from the mercury poisoning and ensuing nephritis , and that Stephenson 's delay in providing medical treatment contributed to her death . The defense claimed simply that she had committed suicide . This had been the verdict of the coroner , Paul F. Robinson , and he testified for the defense at the murder trial . The trial was venued to Noblesville , a small county-seat town not far from Indianapolis . Thus Stephenson , seeking justice , came back from the wicked capital city to the country folk whence sprang his original power ; but now he came charged with heinous crime . Surprisingly , the courtroom was not always packed . Did " good people " stay away for fear of blushing ? Perhaps . Yet everyone sensed that more was on trial here than one man charged with killing a girl . It was said that death threats were received by the prosecutor , William H. Remy , a zealous reformer and one of the few Marion County officials elected the year before without Stephenson 's support . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand . The defense established an alibi for Klenck ( he was discharging his duties as deputy sheriff at the time of the attack ) . Its witnesses testified that Madge had known Stephenson a little longer and a little better than her dying declaration indicated , but that was all . The court refused a defense offer to prove that Madge had visited a married man at police headquarters and that his wife had caught them . This , and testimony indicating that Madge at one time or another had suggested having a drink , were the only attempts to blacken the girl 's character . Attacking the point in the dying declaration where she related that Stephenson and Gentry had stopped at the Hotel Washington to pick up the tickets , one witness testified that he had seen her sitting alone in the car and that she seemed under no duress . Two newspapermen testified that they had seen no serious wounds on the dead girl 's body . The trial lasted more than a month ; the transcript covers 2,247 pages . Judge Sparks , charging the jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another by fear to suicide , and that this would amount to felonious homicide . But in such cases the suicide must have been a reasonable step taken in well-grounded fear of immediate violence and must have been the natural consequence of the " unlawful conduct " of the person who caused the fear . These questions were for the jury , which also had to consider Madge 's past relations with Stephenson and her chances of seeking help during the abduction ; the question of whether she went to Hammond willingly was crucial . If she assented to the event which caused the " remorse , grief , shame , or humiliation " that drove her to suicide , then of course no homicide had been committed . But if she had been assaulted forcibly , then the jury had to determine whether suicide was a logical consequence , that is , whether , to a virtuous woman , death might be preferable to dishonor . This alone would be sufficient to convict . If the defendants , having abducted Madge forcibly , willfully kept her prisoner in the Stephenson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder . Judge Sparks defined second-degree murder as unpremeditated homicide committed " purposely and maliciously , " and he defined malice as not simply ill will but as " any wicked or corrupt motive . " Klenck and Gentry were acquitted . And Stephenson was sentenced to life imprisonment . NV THAT would happen now , politi- cally ? Stephenson went to prison boasting that Governor Jackson would pardon him . He did n't . It becameknown that Jackson had rebuffed the Klan in state appointments after Stephenson 's arrest . After the Stephenson verdict was in , the ordinary Klansmen went on holding their meetings as always , but the professional politicians were quick to read the omens . They who so recently had welcomed Klan support now shunned it desperately . The Democrats feared that the Klan , spurned by Jackson , would move in on the Democrats : Frank P. Baker , Democratic boss , said , " We do n't want the poisonous animal to crawl into our yard and die . " Democrats sensed a new political weapon . The Republican organization was splintering into factions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly was flying apart . For years to come " Stephensonism " would be a label fatal to any Indiana politician . They all knew it ; they scurried to cover . The thunderclouds blackened . The fearful politicians heard rumblings from the penitentiary at Michigan City : Stephenson , embittered by Jackson 's refusal to act , was going to blow the lid off . Finally the storm broke . Stephenson wrote a note to Thomas H. Adams , editor of the Vincennes Commercial , disclosing the location of two " black boxes " containing Stephenson 's private papers . The Indianapolis Times , under editor Boyd Gurley , launched a crusade . Stephenson played ball : " I have been railroaded to prison to protect others . " It became plain that Stephenson for years had collected evidence against the politicians he corrupted . Guided by Prosecutor Remy , three Marion County grand juries conducted the investigation . Witnesses disappeared . The black boxes disgorged . The mayor of Indianapolis was indicted for violation of the corrupt practices act ; on February 4 , 1931 , he began serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council , indicted for receiving bribes , paid small fines on minor charges and resigned . The entire city administration had been overturned . But the inquisitors were after bigger game . The Times produced a $2,500 check ( among others ) drawn by Stephenson in favor of Ed Jackson during the 1924 campaign . " After three weeks ' deliberation " Jackson explained that the check was payment for a riding horse named Senator , which had choked to death on a corncob . Finally came evidence purporting to show that Jackson , while a candidate , had offered a bribe of money and immunity to Governor McCray , then under indictment on the charge which later sent him to the penitentiary . Jackson was indicted , but he pleaded the statute of limitations and was saved . Other officials were indicted . The former Republican state chairman went to Leavenworth on a conspiracy charge . Evidence indicated that a congressman had pledged his post-office patronage to Stephenson . Judge Clarence W. Dearth of Muncie was impeached ; he once had threatened a newsboy peddling an anti-Klan paper ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . For its part in building the fire under the Klan the Indianapolis Times won the Pulitzer Prize in 1928 . By that time the Klan claimed only four thousand members in Indiana . V qs the Klan , as such , dead today in In-it. diana ? Probably only a few local groups survive . Could it be revived ? Probably not , under that name . But this war will end some day , and Hoosier bigotry and boredom are not dead . Newspapermen consider the Negro problem dangerous in Indianapolis ( and in other cities as well ) ; in the summer of 1943 Negro soldiers , denied entrance to a park swimming pool , stoned a street car , and the story was suppressed . Though the Klan is today no longer a potent organization , it appears to survive as political poison . True , among the men washed into minor local office by the Republican tides of 1940 and 1942 there were a number of holdovers from the Klan , long out of power . But not until June of 1944 was any important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Robert W. Lyons , a personable Richmond lawyer and millionaire chain-store lobbyist , who had been active for four years in Dewey 's behalf ? but always behind the scenes . Now he came into the open as Republican national committeeman . Abruptly a member of his own party denounced him as having been an officer of the Klan during the Stephenson days . After enduring two weeks ' criticism , Lyons resigned . This of course did not necessarily mean that he relinquished actual power in Indiana Republicanism . In recent years the newspapers have investigated several rumors that the Klan was being revived politically . There has been an ever-present feeling that , if watchfulness relaxed , the Klansmen might yet ride again . Nearly twenty years have passed since Madge Oberholtzer died and the Klan reigned , but much scar tissue remains in Indiana . Stephenson is still in prison , having carried his case unsuccessfully ? through about a dozen appellate actions . He has claimed that Klan death threats prevented him from presenting an adequate defense . In 1940 he was refused clemency by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for parole after he has served fifteen years . Stephenson has served nearly twenty years , which he contends proves he is a " political prisoner . " One political reporter has said that " Indiana governors are politically ambitious and Stephenson is the hottest thing at Michigan City ? if you paroled him it 'd be worse than getting caught stealing ten thousand dollars . " A deputy attorney general has said that Stephenson was denied parole chiefly because he has been unco-operative and imperious toward prison officials . Today he invents gadgets , some , he claims , valuable to the war effort . His case of course has become Indiana 's cause cilebre . He still has blindly loyal followers . Stephenson himself once wrote this note to a newspaperman : " I should have been put in jail for my political activities but I am not guilty of murder . " Many plain people agree .
