A routine story went out on the A.P . wire from Buenos Aires , where Peronistas are out to get rid of Argentina 's two biggest dailies by annoying them to death ( TIME , March 31 ) . The sum of A.P . ' s dispatch was that the Government had sued to collect multimillion-dollar duties on newsprint that oppositionist La Prensa and La Nacin had imported over the last nine years . ( By law , newsprint for " cultural publications " is duty-free . ) In Bogot , Colombia , El Tiempo picked up the dispatch and ran a thundering editorial calling on the press of the hemisphere to lay Juan Pern 's press-badgering before the Rio Conference . <P> Peron 's information office , which regards newsmen and newspapers as being either with the Government , or against it , reacted promptly and typically . It blasted A.P . as " an agency which upsets continental harmony , " and the Peronist press took it up from there . <P> The Government had been pouty about A.P . for some time , especially since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London daily on Eva Peron 's proposed British visit . * Foreign Minister Juan A. Bramuglia discreetly let it be known that it might be a nice idea for slight , 39-year-old Rafael Ordorica , head of the A.P . bureau , to leave . Last week A.P . Boss Kent Cooper called Ordorica home " for consultation , " because , said he , the correspondent had been in Argentina for six years , and it was time they had a chat . <P> <P> * Last week 's shipment of TIME 'S Latin American edition was held up by the customs office in Buenos Aires , apparently in a delayed reaction to the recent cover story on Seora Pern.
