Over three years ago the Germans completed their northernmost front-1,000 miles from their borders , above the Arctic Circle , in northern Norway and Finland . And for over three years they held it almost unchallenged . But last week its liquidation began . Liquidation was precipitated by Stalin 's peace with Finland . <P> Ordinarily , the nation which has superiority in manpower ( in this instance , Russia ) has everything to gain by keeping the enemy 's lines long , the enemy 's armies overextended . As the weaker party , the Germans wanted their troops home , for defense of the fatherland . Although the Finns had refused a Russian proposal that they turn on their allies , the Russians agreed to a peace that would let the Germans go home . For the number of Russian divisions ( well over 20 ) tied up by Germans and Finns together on the Finnish front was out of all proportion to the ten German divisions that the Germans might take home from Finland . <P> Last week from northern Finland civilians streamed out of harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and roads execrable , it looked as if Colonel General Lothar Redulic , in command of the seven Nazi divisions in the north ( not counting three in south Finland ) would not be able to get his troops out by the deadline ( Sept. 15 ) and might , willy nilly , have to put up a fight against the advancing Russians . <P> And even those Nazis who got into northernmost Norway would still be in a rat trap . Hitler 's persistence in refusing to give up a foot of ground might again pay dividends to the Allies . To help bottle up the tens of thousands of Germans in Norway north of the Circle , the British Home Fleet sent carriers to the fjord-slashed coast . <P> Against brisk air opposition , the carriers ' planes dived on the lame super-battleship Tirpitz . They scored some hits , although damage could not be assessed through the Nazis ' effective smokescreens . They hit a destroyer , a tanker , supply ships , flak ships and radio stations .
