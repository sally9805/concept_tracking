A definite public attitude in the U.S. toward Western Europe was finally taking shape . The attitude in most respects reflected U.S. citizens at their best-a neighborly people , willing to help and prompted by humanitarian impulses , but nevertheless hardheaded and cautious . <P> A nation where charity is Big Business , where community-chest drives and Red Cross campaigns are splendidly supported , understood that free- &-easy; charity sometimes does more harm than good . The U.S. was prepared to help Western Europe , but on a businesslike basis . A lot of U.S. money and goods had already been poured into Europe-more than $8.6 billion since war 's end . The question was : How much good had it done ? From now on Americans were not financing any charitable pig-in-a-poke . There was not going to be any WPA in Europe . <P> The evidence for this attitude came mostly from U.S. Congressmen , whose political lives depend on their appraisal of the sentiment back home . Since the end of the session , Congressmen had been touring Europe in droves . They went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was required of the U.S. They did not go as busybodies , as they frequently had during the war , or as fat-cat junketeers . They were serious men who wanted to do the right thing . <P> The most important group which went abroad was the Select Committee on Foreign Aid , headed by Massachusetts ' Christian Herter . After six weeks of assessing Western Europe 's misery , the committee returned last week . It had exhibited congressional statesmanship at its highest . Committee members had talked to heads of governments , opposition political parties , organized labor leaders , workers , farmers , industrialists . They brought back trunkloads of data and notebooks crammed with impressions . <P> Not only did their performance reflect the new national attitude ; their findings would undoubtedly be the basis for whatever decisions the nation would make . They refused to be hurried . Europe 's cries of urgency were disturbing , even terrifying . But never before in peacetime had a single nation been called upon to make such vast contributions to the world community . Americans , and their representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could help it .
