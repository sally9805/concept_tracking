We Accuse ( Artkino-lrvin Shapiro ) will not be shown in any of the theaters owned by Hays-office members ; that organization disapproves of the film . Its alleged reasons : 1 ) some of the atrocity shots are shown more than once ; 2 ) the word " damned " is used ( it is attributed to the Germans in the line " Let them Russians bury their dead and be damned " ) . Wherever the picture is shown , however , moviegoers will see a powerful and in some respects perplexing record of history-in-the-making . <P> We Accuse documents the Kharkov war-criminal trials ( TIME , Dec. 27 , 1943 ) with the force of a pile driver . It shows the faces of the three virtual nobodies , " typical Nazis , " and of the collaborationist Russian , a " miserable weakling , " who stand accused . It shows the hideous photographs and testimonials of the atrocities , or kinds of atrocity , * to which the accused plead guilty . Even more overwhelming are shots of bereaved women as they touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ; or the restrained but colossal grief and passion for retribution in the faces of the men &; women in the audience as they react to the German secret field policeman 's admission that he is responsible for the deaths of " no more than 40 " Russian civilians . <P> The evidence on the atrocities is convincing ; so is the general culpability of the accused , confessing men . But U.S. spectators will be left wondering about Russian court procedure . ( As Arthur Koestler observes in his new book of essays-see BOOKS : " . . . that those particular Germans committed those particular crimes was proved by no other evidence than their own confession . " ) And the extraordinarily full , frank admissions of the accused Germans are even more mystifying , to a Western mind , than the equally glib confessions of the Russians accused , some years ago , in the Moscow purge trials . <P> Moments as strange as this , in which the proceedings are questionable , make the flesh crawl ; while the picture 's flat actualities , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach turn . <P> Thrill of a Romance ( M.G.M. ) , which is a gently feeble-minded title , suits the action to the words . The main thrill for bobby-soxers and stylish stouts is rosy Van Johnson , a sort of air-conditioned Charles Ray , whose boyish charm is honest and home-cooked enough to keep the men in the audience reasonably fair-minded while the women wallow . The main thrill for the pants- &-Paris-garter; trade is Esther Williams ; she has the kind of body-displayed in a protean series of bathing suits-which you may dream of but are n't inclined to talk about at the breakfast table , and a nice , easy , assured personality to match . For music lovers , insensitive to such carnality , there is Lauritz Melchior , carnal in his own Falstaff-built way .
