" The aluminum strike was called unexpectedly yesterday while representatives of the union and the company were negotiating with Mediation Board officials at Washington .

" Citizens Resent Strike Resentment against the strike was manifested on every hand in Cleveland . During the day the strike was the major topic throughout the city and strong Federal action was being widely advocated . The Cleveland Press printed a front-page editorial urging the strikers and the company to come to an early agreement . The article was headed , " To the 6,000 aluminum workers now on strike : every hour lost to production aids our country 's enemies . " The Cleveland News headline read : " Work stopped on $60,000,000 in U. S. defense orders at aluminum plant . " At the company 's plants the strike wag marked by orderly picketing .

Sandwiches and cold drinks were handed out . Others lolled in the grass in the fields playing cards or dice or just loafing . When local police broke up the dice games ' and threatened arrests and possible fines of $100 for each participant , the union officials brought a sound truck to the plants . From its loudspeakers came the message , " this battle ca n't be won by shooting dice . It must be won on the picket line . " Later , when the dice players were dispersed , the truck ' played swing music for the pickets outside the plant . Pickets handed out mimeographed throwaways which asserted that the national officers of the die casting workers union and the C. I. 0 . were supporting the strike " 100 , per cent , " and that the Cleveland C. Z. 0 . Council was planning to engage the support of their 85,000 C. I40. , workers here for the strike . The possibility that the Army would be ' called ' in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strikers and the company tonight , with both sides saying that such a step would not be to their liking . It was thought here that the dispatching of troops ' to the plants would be the last resort of the government , to be taken after all ' other efforts to bring about a settlement had failed . The nearest Army posts with any considerable number of troops are Fort Benjamin Harrison , Indianapolis , and Fort Knox , Kentucky . Ohio has not yet formed a State Guard to take the place of the Federalized National Guard , and therefore Army 1troops would be necessary if the government decided to act .
