For two years manufacturers have pleaded with golfers to turn in old balls for reprocessing , because prewar stocks were exhausted , synthetics no good . Results : negligible . <P> The situation looked desperate last week to the National Golf Foundation , which urged a ball-rationing scheme on the 2,200 U.S. golf pros . For each old ball turned in , the golfer would get a ration coupon for future delivery of a reprocessed one . No coupon , no ball . The N.G.F. balefully added : no balls , no golf .
