For the first time in 25 years , the quiet , efficient , socially backward political machine of Harry Flood Byrd had a real fight on its hands . In Virginia 's genteel valleys and sun-beaten towns , politicians were actually out campaigning for governor . <P> With the primary only a week off ( in Virginia , as in all the South , the Republicans do not count ) , three mavericks were out to break the firm grip which Senator Byrd keeps on the governor 's mansion of his home state . Debate waxed hot on Virginia 's hustings . At pre-primary barbecues , crab feasts and picnics , Harry Byrd 's obedient lieutenants acted like men who had to work for votes . <P> The patriarch himself had taken time out from his Senate duties to intervene in the campaign-something he had not done since his own gubernatorial walk-in in 1925 . He bustled about , trumpeting for State Senator John S. Battle . <P> To citizens of tidewater counties last week , Candidate Battle appealed for votes with 50 barrels of iced crabs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : that " out-of-state labor leaders " were plotting to overturn Virginia 's " good government . " <P> Battle concentrated his fire on the man who was the greatest threat to Harry Byrd 's political future-bald , ruddy Francis Pickens Miller , 54 , onetime Rhodes scholar , veteran of both World Wars , longtime New Dealer . Miller had the social background to appeal to many Byrd-backing Virginians ( as a child , his mother had been taken for rides on General Robert E. Lee 's horse , Traveller ) and he had the support of Virginia 's growing labor movement plus a large share of the Negroes , now voting in increasing numbers . <P> Ordinarily Byrd 's steamroller would flatten a man like Miller with ease . But two other conservative candidates might divide Harry Byrd 's traditional bloc of 110,000 to 130,000 machine-turned votes . They were Horace Edwards , 46 , former mayor of Richmond , who broke with the machine last year when Byrd tried to keep Harry Truman 's name off Virginia 's ballot ; and Remmie L. Arnold , a pen &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slated to become Imperial Potentate of the Shrine in 1954 ) . <P> Harry Byrd was outwardly confident . " I think , " said he , " that John Battle has a very substantial edge in the race . " But if Harry Byrd was wrong , plenty of Virginians would have reason to worry . While rampaging in the U.S. Senate over the growing U.S. bureaucracy , Harry Byrd had managed in 25 years of rule to build up a Virginia bureaucracy of 73,174 state and local public employees-one for every 41 Virginians.
