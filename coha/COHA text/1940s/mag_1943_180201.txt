Westinghouse has solved a delicate problem in electronic tube-making . A steel splinter used to be thrust into each tiny coiled filament for support while it was welded . But removing the steel support afterward was difficult . Now a slender stick of raw spaghetti , turned out to a thousandth-of-an-inch accuracy , takes the steel 's place . After the coil is welded , an electric current burns up the spaghetti core in a flash . For this ingenious idea , which cuts filament-assembly time from five minutes to one , Westinghouse Engineer William A. Hayes got a WPB award of Individual Production Merit .
