Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin is reputed a restless sleeper ; he rarely gets to bed before 2 a.m . But last week , Stalin sent the world a soporific greeting ( with a wakeful edge ) . Six British Laborites , led by pro-Communist M.P . Konni Zilliacus , visited Stalin at his seaside villa at Sochi ( where he recently ended his triumphal inspection of the Soviet Fleet-see cut ) . To his callers , the Generalissimo said : <P> " The Soviet Union has always stood for improvement of political and economic relations with all countries . . . beginning with the U.S. and Britain . . . . Cooperation between different economic systems is possible . If , however , they do not want to improve their relations with the Soviet Union , we shall have to do without them . We shall be able to carry on ... until they regain their reason and understand that cooperation between nations is necessary . . . . We can wait . We are a patient people .

I sometimes say that mankind today is at 2 o'clock in the morning . . . . "
