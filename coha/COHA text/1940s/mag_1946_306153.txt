Gallery-goers who had come to expect murky realism of Charles Ephraim Burchfield were in for a surprise . Artist Burchfield has had a violent shift of purpose . One of the top half-dozen painters of the " American Scene , " Burchfield , at 52 , has decided that the look of a scene is not enough . Said he last week , as his first Manhattan show since 1943 opened : " Subject matter can be distracting ; I 'm trying to paint more what I feel . " <P> To paint the way he feels , Burchfield has tried hard to remember the country around Salem , Ohio , where he was raised-instead of the bleak surroundings of suburban Buffalo , where he now lives . His house was on the edge of Salem , and the edge of the woods . When he was eight , Burchfield knew how to tell trees apart , and how to people their shadows with figures he had read about in fairy tales . Four years at the Cleveland School of Art and a job with an automobile-parts company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings in 1917 were fantasies based on childhood impressions of nature . <P> But after World War I he suddenly decided that his fantasies were " flat " ; he shuffled off to Buffalo and got a job designing wallpaper . Sundays he painted literal descriptions of the more depressing sights he saw around town . They sold well enough for him to retire to suburban Gardenville in 1929 and concentrate on showing the U.S. its dreary back streets and railroad sidings . Burchfield has the unassuming confidence of a man who has learned a lot slowly , believes that now , in combining fantasy and realism , he has come full circle . Says he : " All the rest was a sort of preparation . I am now beginning to do the things I was really intended to do . " <P> Burchfield , a six-footer , looks like a well-dressed , grey-haired businessman who has pleasant secrets of his own , but he is wistful and diffident . He likes to talk about his work , and talks well . <P> Each of the six huge watercolors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got ideas for his howling , Disney-like Blizzard ( which he describes as " the sort of storm that might have descended on that mythical village of the old fairy tale The Snow Queen " ) by tramping Gardenville 's streets on last winter 's worst days , when it was too cold to stop anywhere long and sketch . He sees in it , above the houses , " the ghostly spirit of the wind and snow , about to engulf the village , and beyond that is a dark , sinister shape fashioned out of the moving void of the air . " <P> Cherry Blossom Snow , a picture of spring , has two dates on it : 1917 ( when he first painted it ) and 1945 , when he improved upon it . He calls it " a child 's impression of nature ... a remembrance of coming home from school at noon and being awed by the sight of such an event . " <P> Burchfield is gently suspicious of abstractionists like Picasso ( " I do n't think he is just sincere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public " ) , but he sometimes uses abstract patterns himself , as in August Evening ( see cut ) in which elaborate , curlicued heat waves rise from the trees and housetops.
