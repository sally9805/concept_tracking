Headache is not a disease but a symptom . Like a heavy hammer beating on the temples , headache plays a chorus to an almost limitless number of ailments , can be caused by infections , high blood pressure , bad ventilation , brain concussion , intoxication . Last week , at New York 's Academy of Medicine , authorities on headaches discussed recent research : <P> Dr. Harold George Wolff , who has researched ten years of headaches at New York Hospital , explained their mechanical causes . No matter how a sufferer may feel , the ache is never in the brain itself . Brain tissue , a grey and white mass of nerve cells and fibers , can be punctured , crushed or even burned without causing the slightest sensation of pain . But the veins and arteries which feed the brain and scalp , the membranes that cover the brain , some of the nerves of the head and neck are excruciatingly sensitive ( see cut ) . Most headaches , said Dr. Wolff , come from the dilatation of these blood vessels or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that exerts a pull on them . <P> &gt; Great-grandfather of all headaches is the torture of migraine , caused by distention of blood vessels in the scalp . Its victims are agonizingly sensitive to light and sound . Injections of vitamin BI sometimes give relief ( TIME , Feb. 16 ) . <P> &gt; When a person drinks too much alcohol , or whenever tissues are damaged , some of the body 's natural proteins turn into a substance called histamine . Some researchers believe that histamine dilates the tender arteries of the tough membrane ( dura mater ) that lines the skull , and a splitting hangover headache is the result . High fevers and various kinds of infections also distend these arteries and cause pain . <P> &gt; Many headaches have psychic causes . One woman had two operations to relieve a severe pain on the left side of the head . No relief . When doctors questioned her closely , they found the headaches started when her husband had slapped her on the left side of the face . <P> &gt; On the home medicine shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acetylsalicylic acid-is the No. 1 headache drug . Last month it was the first drug to be price-fixed by the Office of Price Administration . It does not cure headaches , but acts as a pain killer by deadening the nerves . <P> <P> *Trade-named Aspirin , Saletin , Acetophen , Empirin , etc.
