On the night of May 7 , 14-year-old Michael Hippisley popped dutifully into his bed at the Stowe School , Buckingham , England . A moment later he began to sneeze . Within an hour his sleepless dormitory mates had counted 1,200 kerchoos ; they estimated that he continued to sneeze every three seconds for the rest of the night . <P> Next day Michael Hippisley , a hay-fever victim , who had injections for hay-fever last winter , was bundled off to the infirmary .

When I snap my fingers you will wake up and tell your mother , ' I have stopped sneezing . ' " Waters snapped his fingers and Michael woke with a violent kerchoo . <P> When newspapers carried pictures of Michael 's paroxysms , concerned Britons swamped the Hippisleys with hundreds of phone calls and letters offering home remedies , none of which worked. * <P> By last week , Michael had sneezed more than 150,000 times .
