txt Fred M. Vinson , Director of Economic Stabilization , ended today a monthlong inquiry into all aspects of the meat situation by putting a ceiling of *18 a hundredweight on live cattle and making substantial increases in subsidies to packers for paying the higher price . The program , which is to get under way on Jan. 29 , and last until July 2 , presumably ends a heated dispute between the meat packing and selling trade and cattle producers . Retailers , restricted by price ceilings , had staged a strike in New York City and producers had met with the Office of Price Administration and with Mr. Vinson in an effort to avert the new maximum price sought by the OPA . Today 's action was immediately lauded by Chester Bowles , Price Administrator , as " a great step forward " toward better retail price control . He told a press conference it was " a program which will not hurt anybody at all but will help us to get a tighter grip on our meat . " An opposite reaction , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cattlegrowing States straightway announced their intention to restrain // the order with " some kind of a resolution , or maybe a bill . " Speaker Rayburn conceded that there would probably be an attempt to countermand the order , but added that he himself opposed " Congressional price-fixing . " The ruling supplants in some respects and strengthens in others a cattle price stabilization program announced Oct. 26 , 1943 . Then " a stabilization price range " was established for all grades of cattle ' and subsidies were provided to encourage packers to pay prices within the specified range . In setting the ceiling and increasing the subsidy , today 's ruling also stipulates that the penalty for violating the price ceiling will be enforcement action by the OPA , possibly a maximum fine of $10 , - 000 , or a maximum jail sentence of ten years , or both . Formerly , violators of the self-imposed price ceiling " range " sacrificed only the subsidy payments which they otherwise would have received . Five Points in Program The terms of the new program which , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general plan for controlling meat prices , may be summarized as follows : 1 . The OPA and the War Food Administration will establish an " over-riding " ceiling on live cattle and calves on the basis of $18 a hundredweight at Chicago until July 2 , when the ceiling will be lowered to $17.50. 2 . The Defense Supplies Corporation will increase the subsidy payments on choice or grade AA beef by $1 , and good , or grade A beef by 50 cents a hundred pounds , live weight . On July 2 the subsidy payment on choice cattle will be reduced 50 cents . 3 . OPA and the War Food Administration will increase the stabilization price range for choice cattle by $1 and good cattle by 50 cents a hundred pounds , throughout the country . On July 2 the maximum of the range will be reduced 50 cents for choice cattle . 4 . The two agencies will issue a regulation making it an OPA violation for a slaughterer to pay more for cattle , on the average , than the maximum prices of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will delegate authority to the price administrator to issue an order establishing the maximum percentage of good and choice ' cattle any slaughterer may slaughter or deliver during a month . The last point , Mr. Bowles told reporters , would probably mean less high-grade beef in New York City , because of that community 's present high percentage of choicest cuts . " In New York there has been a tendency over a period of years to buy only good and choice cattle , " he said . " In the new plan , they will have to buy a certain amount of the lower grades . " Commenting on Mr. Vinson 's ruling Senator Clyde Reed , Republican , of Kansas , warned the country that it might as well prepare " for a meat shortage through 1945 . " He called tile action " a blow at cattle feeders , " and Representative James F. O'Connor , Democrat , of Montana , said the directive hit the producer " square in the face " , and would lower beef production . Reactions Here Are Varied New Yorkers may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the $18 livestock ceilings , according to Markets Commissioner Henry M. Brundage . He said last night that the latest Government step had accomplished " absolutely nothing " toward a solution of the meat muddle and his opinion was echoed by the retail meat trade here . The regional Office of Price Administration issued a statement which said : " Generally speaking , the Vinson directive is a long step forward toward providing a larger meat supply . It is aimed at putting a lid on competition for choice and good grade cattle . As far as the regional office is concerned , we are definitely opposed to any increase in the consumer prices of meat . " Jack Kranis , counsel for the city-wide retail meat dealers action committee , said the ceilings would mean " a four-cent increase a pound to consumers . " Commissioner Brundage , pointing out that the whole structure of wholesale and retail ceiling prices had been set up when choice cattle were selling at $13 and $14 a hundredweight , said it was " obvious that any ceiling on livestock substantially higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another . " " As we understand the new subsidy , " he added , " it does not begin to make up for this difference . " Criticism of the Vinson directive came also from the office of one of the " Big Four " packers . G. E. Mitchell , New York district manager for Swift &; Co. , said : " News reports indicate that subsidies to meat packers have been increased on certain grades of cattle . We have protested from the beginning that Government subsidies should be paid directly to those whom they are intended to benefit . The cattle producer should receive the subsidy from the Government , not through the packer . The new order only continues and magnifies the original error in this respect . " Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia appealed to everybody " to wait and see the terms of the order . " The Police Department reported that a survey of 6,192 retail meat shops showed 5,419 open , fortyseven fewer than on Tuesday .               @ @ @ @ @ @
