TREAT THE NATIVES KINDLY A STORY BY JOHN BURGAN Illustrations by Robert Greenhalgh Y THE Navy 's definition , the tiny B anti-aircraft outfit which I com- manded for a while during the war was an uncommissioned unit . Perforce , we were a dependent , parasitic organization which sat idly on the West Coast for many months before the Pacific high command decided who was to be our parent organization . When , in December 1943 , we finally went into action under the fostering wing of the Marines , we were in technical aspects a highly-trained unit but in practical military terms as tender a group of tenderfeet as ever got hung up on a reef under fire . Which we did , although we had the luck of beginners and escaped without damage . There were thirty-one of us , one officer and thirty men . None of us had ever seen a Pacific island before we raised the coast of Korialen in the dawn of December 3 , 1943 . But remarkably enough , there is not much to relate about the combat phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns were in position on the second day of the invasion and we had no disasters during the entire seven days of battle . By the time the campaign was finished , we felt that we were hardened Pacific veterans at long last . We had now had it , as they say . The naivet ? of this solemn feeling was not demonstrated until the post-battle period when we met Bill Tingos , a native rancher of Korialen . Although the indoctrination booklets in the States had told much about the Pacific peoples and had relentlessly urged upon us a feeling of patriotic kinship with them , there were a number of matters for which we could have been better prepared . Quite properly , the booklets had exhibited considerable concern for the possibility that we might abuse the amenities of life among the natives and so offend our allies . But the instruction in this direction had been so emphatic that an inexperienced invader , reading the Korialen publication series , was insulated against any suspicion that a native might abuse his privileges as host . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this respect . He filled in the blank spaces for us , at times fairly romping in the areas of our ignorance . I MET Bill Tingos immediately after the organized fighting was finished . The defending forces ordered us to set up our light guns on a high bluff on the rugged , forested northern shore of the island in the modest hope that we might harry any low-flying Japanese raiders which might try to sneak in from not-toodistant enemy bases . Bill Tingos ' ranch was about a mile or so down the coast from us . We were in a lonely position , far from the comforting security of the big camps on the island . There were substantial military estimates that hundreds of armed Japanese vagrants were hiding in the bush country in our area . Any friendly neighbor was welcome . And Bill Tingos was nothing if not friendly . He visited us the day we arrived in the neighborhood . Bill was about fifty years old , a brown , gaunt native with strong , stringy arms and legs . He was tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His face was a curious mixture of the round features of the Micronesians in an elongated shape that indicated some Western blood . At some time in the distant past , his last name may have been English , Spanish , or German , becoming distorted in the melange of dialects spoken on the island . Bill had seen much of Australians , English-men , Germans , and orientals in the plantation trade . He was a fluent speaker of English . He had at least a dozen children , ranging in age from a sulky grown-up son to an infant boy . He was a cocoanut rancher by profession and better off than most native farmers . Set in a jungle of palms , bananas , and pandanus , his house was a structure on short stilts that had been revised and multiplied so often it had become a dismal reproduction of the imprint of Random House . The correct measure of Bill Tingos ' prosperity , by native standards , was to be found in his livestock . He had a little dun-colored hunchbacked bull , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a massive carting earabao , a substantial number of chickens which had the lean look of fighting stock , and a number of pigs , living in a pen near his house . If we had realized how few natives owned the equivalent of Bill Tingos ' jungled estate , we might have been somewhat more cautious in our preliminary dealings with him . The first time Bill came to our camp , he brought us a basket of soursops , which are ubiquitous spiny green melons , grown in many parts of the Pacific , and whose creamy meat tastes not unlike a pleasant combination of strawberries , grapefruit , and peaches . Bill wanted to do many things for us . " If you kindly tell me what I do , " . he said , half-bowing , " I do it . " Since we were in the first stages of placing our camp in the wilderness , there was almost nothing in help or food that was MAGAZINE not acceptable to us . We paused in our job to inspect this skinny brown man , accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : How had it been , living under the Japs ? Was he surprised when we invaded the island ? Bill Tingos was very graphic . " The Japs , they are hard on the poor fella , " he said . " They do not care for nothing . They give the water treatment . " This latter , he explained , was the forced pouring of water down one 's throat . We readily assumed that he had experienced this form of torture and a good many of the men romanticized on it in their letters home . I know , because I censored the mail . Bill was tremendously enthusiastic about the liberation of his island , as one would expect . Each time he alluded to it , he seemed unable to refrain from a grateful half-bow to me or to anyone in uniform . I recall thinking that this mannerism was probably a relic of long months under the harsh military discipline of the Japs . I was to discard this theory later when it became clear that Bill was humble and grateful for approximately the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never heard , one Uriah Heep . Bill even went to work for us . He joined the chief gunner 's mate 's gang and for a couple of days he helped to clear away palm trees which obstructed the gun positions . He did not mention that he owned the trees , even when we chopped the boles open to extract the hearts of the palms for salad . But I heard afterward that he entered a heavy claim against the military government a month later and received a considerable sum for the destruction we had done . F Rom the first , my chief gunner 's mate did not care much for Bill . The chief was about twenty-five years old , an extremely intelligent farm boy from the Middle West , who had developed an amazing affinity for the complicated mechanism of light anti-aircraft ordnance . Because all of the other men were youngsters in their teens , the chief and I were drawn rather closely together . He was a solemnly wise sort and we were , I think , always good friends . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of the responsibility for the outfit with me . He speculated curiously about Bill Tingos as they became acquainted , but I was too preoccupied with our gunnery problems to be interested . The men seemed to like the native . In fact , the early days of our relationship were replete with the first fine zest of friendship . Bill Tingos brought us some eggs and , once , a small pig . He offered us numerous other things and foresaw many of our desires before we even felt them . These happy contacts with him were soured only slightly by the emerging knowledge that Bill always wanted something in return . We regarded it as only fair that he should get some flour , condensed milk , coffee , and tea . The youngsters in our outfit began to spend most of their off-duty hours at Bill 's ranch and it was not long before each of them was carrying presents to Bill . They had discovered that visitors bearing gifts were favored in his home . The chief gunner 's mate mentioned this matter to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning to shrink at a ridiculous rate . The chief and I did some hell-raising about it , but our threats did not work well for the simplest of reasons . Bill Tingos had several daughters of an interesting age group , fourteen to nineteen . Furthermore , the story got around that the oldest one had been the mistress of the Japanese island commander for a while and had lived with him at his headquarters before it had been finished off by our cruisers . Why this story had the result it did is a commentary on perversity . The young lady became the most sought-after companion in that part of the world , with immediate and damaging effects upon our food stores . My chief gunner 's mate and I decided it was time to lay about violently before most of our property moved to Bill Tingos ' ranch . So we declared the ranch house out of bounds for two weeks . This hurt Bill 's feelings so much that he came to camp to see us about it . " We have been such friendships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , removing his hat and standing respectfully with bowed head . The chief gunner 's mate enjoyed this spectacle immensely . " It 's not your fault , Bill , " he replied soothingly . " You did n't know where the stuff was coming from , did you , old pal ? " " No , " said Bill humbly . He was so earnest in his answer that we somehow felt we dared not even smile . However , we kept Bill 's ranch on the blacklist for the full period , even though the order produced the precise effect that would have been anticipated by a more experienced commander . Most of the men sneaked over to Bill 's anyway . When they failed to get there , the girls hung around the camp at a respectful distance . As the time expired , we took the curse off Bill 's place with the modest hope that everybody would be more careful about our supplies in the future . We had hardly got started on our new footing , however , before the incident of our two-wheeled light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we needed it and one of the men claimed he had seen it at Bill 's ranch but thought we had loaned it to the rancher . Bill , however , knew nothing about it . He had never even seen our trailer . So he said . And it was two weeks before we found the vehicle ; or rather , it was two weeks before I passed it along one of the island 's rice paddies . It had been fitted with shafts and when I caught up to it in my jeep it was jolting along slowly , drawn by a carabao , and driven by a fat little native . The numbers were still on it in three-inch letters but the native was reluctant to give it up . He had found it in the jungle , hesaid . Perhaps he had . But the suspicion grew and remained that Bill Tingos had sold it to him . Once more the chief gunner 's mate and I went over the Tingos situation but we did not declare the ranch out of bounds again . We did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we contented ourselves with a lecture to the men on the subject of generosity to Bill Tingos . They received our suggestions in respectful silence because they were standing at attention to muster at the time . Otherwise , there seemed to be no noteworthy results . So we put an armed guard over our commissary day and night , hoping that the guards would not conspire together to remove supplies themselves . This was our first real progress in the problem of our involuntary enrichment of Bill Tingos . The diminution of our supplies seemed to be checked . The chief and I were just congratulating ourselves on the salubrious results of our new system when Bill Tingos ' profit-taking activities affected us from another direction . AF EW miles away from our camp there was a native village in which the Army maintained a squad of infantry under a young sergeant . He was a cheerful chap and he stopped to see us occasionally , eventually striking up quite a friendship with our chief gunner 's mate . It was the sergeant who brought us the disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rumors were passing through the village to the effect that any natives who wanted GI canned food could get the stuff from Bill Tingos  --  at a price . " I thought you would want to know , " the sergeant said . " If Tingos gets caught , the authorities will suspect that you are in on the deal . You 're the only military outfit near him . " The chief gunner 's mate and I knew we were involved . We had no doubt that the supplies which Bill Tingos was selling were ours . " Where did you hear this ? " I asked . " A couple of natives told me , " the sergeant said . " They do n't like this Tingos much in the village . They say he was a Jap-Iover . " " A Jap-lover ? " " He took good care of the Japs around here , " the sergeant said . " Gave them anything they wanted , the natives claim . He was a pal of the Jap captain who used to be billeted in the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nothing , " the chief gunner 's mate snorted . And this seemed to be the source of greatest chagrin to him all through the conversation . That Bill Tingos had been friendly to the Japs did not bother the chief so much as the fact that he had given his services to them and was selling them to the Americans . After the sergeant left that evening , the chief suggested that we give Bill a highhanded kind of treatment to intimidate him into more respectable ways . Having no better solution , I accepted the idea . The chief climbed in the jeep and drove to Tingos ' ranch and ordered Bill to accompany him to my tent , preparing the native on the way for some harsh news . So I played the Prussian role of the offended occupation commander and I threatened Bill with immediate delivery to the POW stockade . Bill was almost prostrated by the cruel interpretation we had placed on his works ; he had been imperfectly understood by everybody , it seemed . Yes , it was true he had given food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not true that he had sold it . Except , of course , in cases where friends had forced him to take a little money . " I am a poor man , " he said , " and I make a mistake . I should not took this money . " I believe there were genuine tears in his eyes as he stood before me and I remember feeling very much the villain of the act by the time it was finished . " I go to give back the money , " Bill said when we let him go . " I did not know it was a wrong thing , to help my friends . " He bowed in farewell and went out the door . " There goes a slippery guy , " the chief said . He ruminated bitterly again on the disclosure that Bill had been so generous with the Japs and so money-minded with our troops . Whether Tingos ever gave the money back to the villagers , I do not know . I suppose he did not . Anyway , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIORTLY after this incident we had one of those trying experiences with our search radar that were characteristic of electronic apparatus during the war . It is no secret now that some of our radar was not exactly as graphic as motion picture film . It is also no secret that sometimes it became erratic for reasons which bordered on the occult . For two weeks the chief and I tested , replaced , and jiggled parts of our system to bring it back to normality . By the time this ordeal was over , Bill Tingos and his activities were reduced to decidedly secondary quantities in my thinking . When , one sunny morning , the radar began suddenly to behave as if nothing had ever been wrong with it , the chief and I accepted this gift of the gods and repaired to my tent with a number of chilly , beaded cans of beer from the galley refrigerator . After a few cold ones the chief wandered off and I took a nap which extended into the late afternoon . When I awoke it had cooled somewhat but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp the low drone of the generators and from across the tented street the tinkle and clang of pans in the galley where the cook was working . I had not been awake for more than a few minutes when I heard our jeep chug up the driveway into the camp . In a moment the chief gunner 's mate came up and poked his head through the doorway . " You awake ? " he asked . He came in and dropped into a carpentered chair beside my cot , a distinctly exuberant air on his face . " Boy , " he exulted quietly , " I 've got enough on that Tingos to hang him . " He did not pause for any questions from me . Instead , he plunged directly into his story . That morning , he said , he had decided to resume his interest in the affair Tingos and , accordingly , had gone to Bill 's house . There he had been told that Bill was working in one of his cocoanut groves up in the hills . The chief thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill 's activities and so had hiked up into the bush country . Even with his suspicions , I think , the chief 's discoveries were rather wider than he had hoped for . When he reached the fringe of the palm grove , he hung back under the jungle cover in order to look about the area unseen and perhaps observe Bill Tingos at work . It was not difficult to do . Bill was clearly visible across the grove . He was sitting on the ground quietly conversing with a Japanese soldier . " I watched them , " the chief told me , " and I saw this character give the Jap some C-rations . Our C-rations ! How do you like that ? " " What did you do ? " I asked . The chief blushed . " Nothing , " he said . " When I went out this morning , I left my gun here . " The chief had remained concealed until the Japanese soldier arose and disappeared into the bush . Then he backtracked the jungle trail for a short distance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up from the ranch . " You should have seen that Jap-lover squirm , " he chortled . " He did n't know whether I had seen anything . " " Did he have a gun ? " I asked . " Yeah , he had that old carbine of his . But I did n't need to be afraid of this character . He always wants to be on the winning side . " I got up and began to put on my clothes . " We had better give this to the intelligence people and let them take over from here , " I said . I finished dressing and we went outside to the jeep . We were just climbing in when Bill Tingos ' plodding carabao came up the driveway hauling Bill 's cart . Bill drove up beside us and we paused . The cart contained not only Bill but the fresh corpse of a Japanese soldier who had recently been shot through the head . " I catch a Jap up near my grove , " he said , smiling . We were dumfounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at least as tall as I am , he seemed only half my size because of his continual bowing and scraping . There was nothing in his meek brown face but the blandest humility . " It 's the same Jap , " the chief whispered hoarsely . " Bill knows whose side to be on now . " The corpse had been a chubby little fellow whose red and silver collar marks indicated an Imperial Army captaincy . With the blood drained away , his facial features and hands had taken on the minute and pale delicacy of the newly dead . " How did you get him ? " I asked Bill . " Oh , I knew him once , " Bill said candidly . " He many times come to make me give eggs and things . Very cruel fella . Glad to meet him today . " The chief was shifting about impatiently and now he interrupted . " He must have come around after I left you , " he said . Tingos was not to be caught by that kind of bait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come before I see you but I let him go away because I think I follow him and find more Japs . But then you come , Chief . I do not tell you . I wish to have honor of killing him myself . I wish to help U.S.A. also , like you . " There was no reply to this interpretation of the afternoon 's work . So the chief simmered silently . By this time most of our men were crowded around the oxcart speculating on the victim 's rank and the possibilities of souvenirs . So I told Bill to take his prize out and bury it several feet deep . Bill climbed obediently back on his cart and , with plenty of followers , drove out of the camp . " What do you think of that ? " the chief murmured wonderingly . " He murders his old friend just because we were getting too hot on his trail . " We got in the jeep and drove to the nearest garrison camp and reported the incident to an intelligence officer . The next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing happened afterward . Much later I met cane of theofficers who had talked to Bill . He was very casual . " We could n't make anything out of that guy , " he said . " His story seemed okay . After all , what 's one dead Jap , more or less ? The woods are full of them . " This seemed to me a singular way of missing the point but it was not unexpected . So much confusion always attended Bill 's activities that nothing could ever be proved conclusively . T HE vagaries of war planning assisted Bill in the completion of his last deal with our outfit . Although our operations plan had called for us to remain on the island permanently , I was quietly informed by the authorities to stand by for relief at the end of the third month . A garrison outfit was on its way to replace us and we were to report to Noumea for a new assignment . The sudden arrival of an army lieutenant for duty under instruction at our camp gave my men their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news of our impending departure made no greater impression on anybody than it did on Bill Tingos , I 'm quite sure . The relief of one military outfit in the field by another has such possibilities of profit in leftover gear that I suppose it was inevitable that Bill would recognize his opportunity . However , I did not anticipate any such bizarre scheme as Bill worked out , much less foresee its success . I was in the shop tent one morning soldering a connection when one of the young seamen came in and stood about watching me with more interest than such a job could possibly inspire . After he had exhausted all possible desultory topics , I asked him what he wanted . " What 's on your mind ? Do you want to see the chaplain or something ? " The boy laughed but not very heartily . Then he blushed and unhappily blurted it all out at once . " It 's about Bill Tingos , " he said . " He claims I got one of his daughters into trouble . " I laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked . " I was always careful , " he said . " If she 's in trouble , it ai n't me . " This statement was not very helpful to his case , naturally . But I talked to him at considerable length and I sympathized with his belief that Bill Tingos was simply trying to hook him . However , there was no overlooking the gravity of the boy 's position ; I do n't think he fully realized it himself . I am sure there are few institutions which take a more spinsterish official view of sex problems than the armed forces . Confronted with a situation which is usually handled in hushed tone in private life , they always seemed to me to suffer noisy surprise and consternation , resulting in a legal uproar accompanied by extremely severe penalties . Our seaman was facing just such an involvement whether he knew it or not . His mere admission of having been careful was enough to convict him of almost anything . I sent him back to his post and went to talk to the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought . The chief registered no surprise . " Those girls are just a bunch of tramps , ' . ! he said . " Which one is it ? " We sent for the seaman to find out which girl was involved . And this proved to be the worst news of all . It was the youngest of the daughters . " Well , " the chief said after the man had gone , " he 's as good as up the creek , no matter how much she co-operated in the deal . " We agreed there was only one thing to do . We would have to go to the ranch and have a talk with the native . We drove up the road to his house in a mood of self-immolation and found Bill working in his pig pen . He and his eldest son were raking up rubbish and throwing it over the fence where it would not annoy the pigs . Bill ushered us to a little porch tacked on to his rickety but and he offered us a pitcher of home-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we opened the subject . " Yes , yes , " he said , sitting down and permitting himself an indulgent , understanding smile . " The young men  --  so hot-blooded , yes ? " And that statement characterized the whole conversation . He did n't do anything and he did not promise not to do anything . He merely created an atmosphere of doubt and uncertainty . Meanwhile the young girl in question was conspicuously present , bringing us some of our own coffee in new thick GI cups . Her condition was not noticeably advanced , though apparent . Bill presented a very acceptable performance in the role of the father of a wronged daughter . He was his usual Uriah Heep throughout , well-tempered and humble , except for one moment . Simply for the hell of it , I asked him if he would be willing to accept our man as a son-in-law . This startled him . " She is so young , " he said , " and it is more better to marry a native boy who does not go far away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average native 's rigid concept of chastity , I could not imagine . But I knew that if anybody could plot a way around it , Bill Tingos was the best possible candidate for the job . It was a wholly unsatisfactory interview as far as agreements went . But it was fruitful in one respect . Although the possibility had not even been hinted at , the chief and I drove away in our jeep feeling that Bill Tingos could be bought off . " The only thing he is sorry about , " the chief said bitterly , " is that all of his girls did n't get into trouble . That way , he could make a lot more out of the deal . " Our theory was valid . The seaman dickered his way out of his dilemma with one hundred thirty-seven dollars , all the money he had on the pay books . It was a private deal between him and Bill . I was cheered by the thought that we had escaped a messy business . We had come out more evenly perhaps than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or so I comfortably imagined when the thirty-one of us sailed away for Noum6a . Not only was I wrong in this illusion , but time also demonstrated that I had not yet bade Bill Tingos farewell forever . U P ON our arrival in Noumea there occurred one of those headlong changes of plan by which wars are arranged and fought . Instead of being reassigned , the little outfit I commanded was ordered broken up forthwith and I presently found myself in an officers ' pool awaiting a new assignment . Meanwhile I was given temporary duty as an instructor . It was four months before I got permanent orders and , when finally received , the orders were poetic in their irony : I was sent back to Korialen to join one of the outfits staging there for operations farther up the route of the Tokyo Express . And so my next meeting with Bill Tingos was set up . He was no less surprised than I was when I appeared at his house just seven months after my first landing on Korialen . My new associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a native 's house without identifying the place until we arrived there , assuming naturally that a newcomer would not know the host . After our departure from the island , Bill Tingos had established himself as a caterer to parties of officers or men who tired of eating in their own messes . For a fee of a few dollars , he would set up a meal of banquet proportions . I had unknowingly accepted an invitation to one of these exotic affairs . Whether Bill was glad to see me that evening , I do n't know . He was still Uriah Heep , the humble one grateful for all kindnesses , and he shook my hand in a remarkable exhibition of delight at my appearance . His new restaurant business was set up on the porch on which we had held our last conference , and a dozen officers were standing about waiting to eat the spread of delicacies which Bill 's family was placing on the wooden table . It was some time before it dawned on me that one of the young ladies serving the dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble with Bill Tingos . I first noticed her when she appeared with a great platter of pickled fish , a wonderfully aromatic dish whose recipe I never learned . The platter did not interest me at the moment . The young lady , however , did . Her figure showed no evidence of the natal event which , I calculated , should be impending . Instead , she was as young and lithe as ever . I must have registered considerable emotional response to this observation , for Bill Tingos lost no time in answering the question I had not asked . " I happy to tell you my daughter has given birth , " he said . " She gives a boy . " " That 's fine , " I said . Bill bowed in appreciation of my mild congratulations . " The baby comes early , " he said . " That 's what I thought , " I replied . It was a cruel remark but Bill responded with his usual humility . " I must see dinner gets ready for you , This is friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . It was a splendid meal although an odd mixture of native delicacies . There was roast pig with yams , bananas , and herbs in its belly , considerably more of an epicurean treat than the recipe would imply . The women served us broiled chickens and boiled langouste , which , though tougher than Maine lobster , has the same delicate flavor . There were the usual starchy gelatine of taro root , for which a taste can be developed , and a great variety of fruits , as well as the customary native spirits , which taste a little like sauterne , but very little . After dinner Bill took the guests on a brief tour of the place and while the rest of them were so engaged , I went on a tour of my own . A s CASUALLY as I cou ! d , I walked around to the rear of the house where the women were working . The young mother was there and I surprised her while she was nursing the child on the edge of the doorstep . She smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my approach . " Could I see him ? " I asked . She seemed happy that her child had aroused my interest . In a quick motion she slipped her hand over her blouse and lifted the baby away from its feeding . It burrowed its head into her for a moment and , being disappointed , squalled suddenly , turning its face upward . It took only a glance to recognize that Bill Tingos ' last transaction was the most successful he had ever negotiated with our outfit . Screwed up as the little face was , it was easily apparent that Bill Tingos ' grandson was no premature weakling . He was a husky , half-breed Japanese , perhaps the son of the Jap soldier who had been shot by Bill that afternoon many months before . When I returned to the front of the house , Bill Tingos was meekly refusing to accept any money for the dinner . This dinner had been a special friendship occasion , he said . But eventually the guests forced him to take ten dollars , which he accepted with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois , speaking at a hearing on the State Department 's budget and referring specifically to a collection of current American art which had been assembled for the Department by 1 .
