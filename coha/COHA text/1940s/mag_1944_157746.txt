In the beginning was Jo-Uk , the Great Creator , and he made the Sacred White Cow . Out of the Nile that Cow came up . The White Cow gave birth to a man child whom she called Kola ; his grandson was Ukwa . Ukwa took two wives , beautiful holy maidens who rose out of the sacred river . One of Ukwa 's sons , Nyakang , a Negro , went south to the swampy country of the Upper Nile ; there he founded the Shilluk nation and became its first ret ( ruler ) and a demigod . That was about four centuries ago . <P> Last month the passing of Ret Fafiti ( rets , like Christian Scientists , do not die ) brought the stately Shilluk peers into conclave . The peers elected the 30th in a long line of rets : middleaged , blue-black Anei Kur , prepared to install him at Fashoda. * <P> A bodyguard of towering Shilluks , their hair gummed with mud and cattle dung into rampant cockscombs a foot tall , gathered around Anei Kur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they approached the sacred river , they chanted age-old incantations , their meanings lost in history . At Nile-edge they met another bodyguard , bearing bamboo poles with ostrich feathers , defending the revered founder , Nyakang . With thongs of twisted grass , the guards of Nyakang bound the willing Anei Kur , marched him into Fashoda . <P> Inside the crowded inner circle , ringed by huts , Anei Kur saw two comely Nubian maidens , his brides . Priests led him through the chanting throng to one of four royal huts before which stood the sacred stool , Kwom . On the stool stood the image of Nyakang . While the proud Shilluks watched intently , Anei Kur seized the stool by one leg . The priests removed the image and Anei Kur was ret . He retired to a royal hut with his two wives . His people gorged themselves on oxmeat and heady merissa , brewed from millet . <P> Three days later Anei Kur came forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber , invested with the spirit of Nyakang , and rejoicing as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know him as Kuna Jo-Uk-God 's last-born , the immortal ret of the Shilluks . <P> * In 1898 Britain and France almost came to blows over possession of Fashoda , key to the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan , Kitchener of Khartoum won the day for England . <P> <P> CLOSEP
