On her third-floor apartment door in Greenwich House hangs a sign : " Come In Without Knocking . " Mary Kingsbury Simkhovitch , who has been preaching what she calls " Neighborhood " for 44 years , also practices it . Last week some 500 friends &; neighbors came in without knocking , to honor 78-year-old " Mrs. Sim . " <P> Mrs. Sim remembers the Thanksgiving morning in 1902 when a moving van drew up to 26 Jones Street , which had been an anarchist hideout on " the Street of 40 Thieves . " She and her Russian-born husband had picked this vermin-filled , draughty place for a settlement house . Greenwich Villagers peering suspiciously from windows figured " we were just another family moving in , " Mrs. Sim says . They were glad to be accepted that way ; " we did not want to be regarded as strangers bent on uplift . " <P> Jones Street was in need of uplift . It was one of Manhattan 's most densely populated blocks , with an infant death rate of 125 to the thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and it was at the mercy of two notorious adolescent gangs known as the Hudson Dusters and the Gophers . Vice , disease , overcrowded tenements , saloons , no playgrounds-these were the problems of Mrs. Sim 's neighbors . <P> Soap First , Then Art . Mary Kingsbury , born in Boston 's suburban Chestnut Hill , and Radcliffe-educated , had been a " social worker " for several years ; but she despised the Lady Bountiful attitude the term implied . Says she : " I hate to be pictured as a lovely woman doing good . I 'm really pretty realistic . " <P> For weeks , Mary and her husband shook tin cans with coin slits at passers-by until they had acquired $3,000 . Gradually Mary and her neighbors got neighborly . In her first year she held parties in her front parlor , taught cooking classes in tenements , organized a penny bank , a children 's reading room . In between she mopped floors . <P> Greenwich House concentrated on improving living conditions first , because , as Mrs. Sim said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had little soap &; water ? " Infant care and dental clinics , free milk for babies , diet kitchens , public baths and sports ( Gene Tunney did his first boxing in the settlement basement ) were added one by one . Over the years , after the soap &; water , came the art : a music school , a children 's theater , woodcarving , pottery . In 1917 the settlement moved to bigger quarters on Barrow Street . Mrs. Sim agitated for slum clearance , wider streets , parks . <P> America in Small . Mrs. Sim , a white-haired grandmother , still chats occasionally in German with her husband , a 72-year-old professor emeritus of economic history at Columbia . German was the language of their romance 53 years ago at the University of Berlin ( when he spoke no English and she knew no Russian ) . For relaxation Mrs. Sim attends concerts ( " I 'm just a musician gone wrong " ) or walks briskly around the Village , blithely ignoring the traffic lights . <P> Mrs. Simkhovitch retired as director of Greenwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye on it ; she thinks of it as " sort of America in small . " Says she : " The tryout for ' one world ' is in the neighborhood . "
