THE RAIN CAME LAST A STORY BY NICCOLO TUCCI Illustrated by Edward Melcarth I WAS riding a bicycle that afternoon . My friend Giovannino was with me . We held each other by the shoulder at arm 's length and rode lazily along , making plans for a trip to the mountains . When we turned left to a smaller country road , we saw that one part of the sky was black with rain . " Here , " I said , " if we do n't run fast the rain will get there before us . " Others felt that way too : women were quickly unpinning laundry from the lines and rolling big bedsheets toward themselves ; children were being called home ; chairs removed from the front of the houses on the highway ; dogs , ruffled by the wind , came out and sniffed the air . Only the crickets were still going " z-z-z-z-z-z , " but the wheat in the fields was already in a strange motion of fear . Up in the sky , the line dividing clear from cloudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still mounting and mounting and had almost passed us . But the world was still dry . Still , all that came from the storm was dust  --  a dust that blinded us and whipped our faces like the needles of pine trees in the woods . " Car coming , " I said , and we parted , to clear the middle of the road . It had seemed thunder for a moment , but the horn , bidding for space , warned us it was not in the sky but here , right on this narrow road and right behind us . It was a truck , loaded with sand , three men sitting on top of it , huddled togetherunder a huge canvas which kept fluttering noisily in the wind . They too were out to beat the rain . We sped head-down into their dust and were still in it when another car passed us , and it was a miracle that we were not run over . It was an open car with veils , scarfs , sunglasses , tennis caps , and naked arms  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look away from the stones on the road . We even saw the number : there was an eight , a nine , but then the dust went up behind it and we stopped to let it settle . And that was when we heard the shrieking whistle of the brakes , those awful screams , and the motor being started again with frantic roars . We rushed to see what had happened and right near the narrow stone bridge on the curve we saw it . A man with his head off . The body here and the head there . A line of blood across the road . Two peasants who had been working in the field near by ran madly after the cloud of dust , but as the wind curled it up and the road appeared empty again , they came back and did instinctively the least they could : they put the head back in its place , face-down , just as the body was . I recognized them only at that moment : Gino and Emo , and the dead man too I recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shout : " Murderers ! Damn murderers ! " and our voices were trembling . The four of us were horrified and grieved , ready to cry , but for some reason , and it was n't shame , we did n't . Angelina must cry . That was her job . The air was hers , hers was the loss , so the next thing now was to call her . Emo looked at his bloodstained hands shaking in front of him , then said : " And now , who will tell Angelina ? Three kids at home and a fourth one coming any day .. . . " We tried hard to think of something else to do , but there was nothing else to do . We had let the murderers escape , so , having failed our job as avengers , we were accomplices . Now we must go and finish up their job for them  --  find Angelina , tell her , and come back with her grief . " Damn you too , rain , " shouted Emo , and began to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for him to go , as he was busy telling us . " I was right here , " he began , " right near that tree , when Elia called : ' Wait for me , boys , I just want to put the silkworms inside before it rains , then I 'll be back . ' And , Dio Madonna , he had just finished saying this , and just jumped over the ditch and reached the road , when . . . there you see him . " And he looked embarrassed that his story was finished so soon . " Come on , boys , " I said ; " this is no time for words . It 's going to rain any moment . Let 's find a pushcart and carry him to his house . " " I can find the pushcart for you , " said Emo , " but I wo n't go there . " " Who will , then ? " I asked . " Someone must . I am ready to go , but not alone . Who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift like that ? Not I , " said Emo . And the two others made no with their heads . T wo shrill bicycle bells now . Laborers back from work , trying to beat the rain . They had to jump off their seats not to run over poor Elia 's body . " My God , " they said . " Look at him . .. Elia . And where is Angelina ? " " I saw her this morning , " said Giovannino . " She was picking the leaves on the mulberry tree down near the highway . " " She ca n't be there now , " said Gino . " She was through with that tree by noon . " " Over by the house , then . " " No , " said the two laborers . " We just passed it now . Nobody on that tree and it was all clean of leaves . " " She must be on some other tree , then , " I said , and we all hoped ardently she would be , for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to descend on us . Perhaps we would n't have to call . She might learn it the way all things are learned in the open country . Whatever happens there is soon known . It is almost already known by the time it happens . Why this is I have never understood . But for example , right while we were talking there , we saw the faces of women peeping from amid the thick foliage of the vine-trees half an acre away . They wanted to make sure , before coming , that it was important . They had heard our voices , but also seen the clouds . One of them was sent as an advance scout . She crossed two fields , looked at the body , ran back , called the others . In two minutes six women with their yellow straw-knitting in their hands were with us . From the road came small boys : first one , then three , then twelve , barefoot , dusty , half-naked . They formed a circle around Elia 's body and looked down intently as into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the same tone that would be Angelina 's in three weeks or so , the time it takes to have the fate accepted and the sorrow nursed . Suddenly one of the women , fat Gigia , untied a black kerchief from her neck and covered up Elia 's head with it , saying : " Pity for the dead , Goddam it . Shame on you , men , not to have thought of this before . " The children were quite disappointed . " Oooh , " they said , " now we ca n't even see . " " And you , " said Gigia with her big hand almost in Emo 's face , " go call that unfortunate creature now . Call her before it rains . " Emo departed slowly , looking into the distance everywhere . " Call her , " said Gigia again . " Angelina ! " he called , but as his feet were unwilling to go , so his voice seemed to retreat from those few sounds . " And you , " she said to Gino , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gino could leave , Tonino arrived . Tonino was a supervisor on the Tanti estate . He was half-peasant and half-public accountant . He had served with Elia in the army . He knew many things . In fact , although he too was grieved , he soon understood what must be done next . " Women and kids , away , " he shouted . " No pushcart . Call the carabineers . " " But the rain ? " asked Gino . " The rain has nothing to do with this . You ca n't touch a dead man when there has been a mishap or an accident , because he 's a victim . " There was a murmur of surprise as if this were a secret about Elia nobody had known until then . " No . You ca n't , " said Tonino again , although no one had said a word . " And not even in other occurrences of death . Not before the competent authorities arrive . " Then , becoming suspicious , he asked : " Why , have you touched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gino . " What ? You displaced him from the position into which the traffic accident had left him ? " " No , no , not that , " said Gino promptly . " We just put the head back near the body . " " That was against the law , " shouted Tonino . " You will have to respond to the police for that . Go now , find the carabineers and do n't come back until you 've found them . " I gave Gino my bicycle and he went down the road in a hurry . " Women and kids , away , " shouted Tonino again . " Break it up . . . . Break it " I have a right to stay here , " shouted Gigia angrily . " That is my kerchief on his head . I put it there . It takes a woman to command respect for the dead . .. . " The wind lifted one corner of the kerchief and uncovered part of the head while dust was being blown on it . " Did anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " What do I know about doctors ? " answered Gigia . " Doctors ca n't even help us when we are well , what d' you think they could do here ? " " I did n't ask you , " said ' amino to her . Then , seeing me in the crowd , he took off his hat and asked politely : " Did anyone call the doctor , sir ? " " I do n't think so , " I said , " but I will go myself . " " If you do n't mind , " he said , " we will send someone else . You may be more useful here . " G IOVANNINo was sent . Now Gigia placed herself between the storm and the dead body so as to keep that kerchief from being lifted again . The wind played with the black skirt on her immense behind , and every now and then she turned around quite angrily as if someone had tried to pinch her . Then she looked at the clouds . From the far corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown into a bottle . All the rest of the air was green . The mountain range was gone from sight . " The doctor , " she kept saying . " Even the doctor . . . May the Lord blind me if the rain wo n't come first . " Then , turning to the women and children around her she asked : " Ca n't we see that he 's dead ? Ca n't you see it ? " she asked me from a distance . " Yes , " I said , and was embarrassed , so I tried to explain : " The doctor is the only one who can pronounce him dead , " I said . " What do you mean ? " she asked , and the children drew away from the corpse to gather around me as if from me now they were going to learn something very important about death itself . Tonino nodded to my words and sneered , which meant that he and I , of course , the only two civilized persons in the crowd , knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ignorant woman , " he said , " that if the doctor were allowed to issue a death certificate without seeing the deceased , he could give false reasons for the death , and then claim that he had not seen the case ? " " Hm , " she said . " And the police ? What business have they to come here now ? Why do n't they run after those murderers instead of coming here ? " " One ca n't explain these things to an ignorant woman like you , " he said . " Is that so ? " she said . " And if a good Christian puts a head back where it belongs , they may throw him into jail ? Why that ? " " Shut up , " ordered Tonino and she went back to her guard against the wind . " I only hope , " said Tonino , " that Angelina wo n't get here before the doctor and the police . " But she did . First we heard Emo 's voice : " Angelinaaaaa . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Silence . Then , again : " Angelinaaa . " " What is it ? " " Come here . Something . " " But what is it ? Ca n't you tell me ? " " Come here . . . . " " It better be something important or you 'll hear me , for disturbing me when I 'm working on the trees . " Now we could see him . He was running away from her , in our direction . She was running after him , and still talking to him : " To disturb me when I am working .. . It will rain any minute . . And you , damn it . . Ca n't you stop , you fool ? " A short pause , then a first shriek of terror . She had seen the crowd . She was beginning to understand . A more important job than picking leaves . Her fate , what remained of her life and her hopes , that must be lying there . Emo ran past us , and many in the crowd began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed Angelina 's voice ahead of her , now blew the kerchief from Elia 's head again . With contempt . Like the unveiling of a frightful gift . But no matter where the Fates were hiding now , her voice was sent way up and reached them . ND ND here came the police . The blue uniform of the carabineers with the red stripes along their pants . The brigadier was on my bicycle , with Gino running afoot behind him and holding clumsily in his arms the brigadier 's sword , symbol of justice . From the other road , the doctor , on his light two-wheeler , with his new Panama hat and his gray horse . They both came to pronounce , in the appropriate terms of law and science what no one here seemed able to pronounce correctly . Gigia and Tonino , aided by the other women , were now trying to hold Angelina from touching the body . She seemed possessed by one desire alone : to undo at least that , the posture in which death had delivered her destiny to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the road , " she cried . " Let me turn him face-up . .. I must see his face . . . . " Doctor and brigadier greeted each other silently and acknowledged the passage of the Fates . Then they looked at the clouds and the doctor took off his hat , employed one of his sighs of compassion to blow away a bit of dust from its black ribbon , and placed the hat carefully in the carriage , from which he extracted a red blanket and threw it over the horse . " The horse is perspiring , " he said to those around him . " It may catch pneumonia in the rain . " Now the approach to the body was clear . Angelina was being held back by five people , and she cried as if the doctor were going to do her Elia some harm . " What are they going to do to him ? " she yelled . " Murderers , murderers , is n't it enough that they have killed him ? Must they write it down too ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tonino , who knew , among so many other things , also this one . " It 's for the good of your children , Angelina . Have patience , it will soon be over and you 'll be able to cry over him as much as you like . " While the doctor was taking out his pad and foun tam pen , the brigadier was beginning to gather information for his own pronouncement . What was the number of the car ? The color ? And the speed ? The exact hour of the accident ? He nodded and marked down these symptoms of the relapse suffered by Justice on that day . Temperature , pulse , the various functions , everything . " Is the head detached from the body ? " asked the doctor , to avoid lifting the kerchief . " Yes , " said Gino . " We picked it up and put it back ourselves . Was that against the law ? " " Take it up with the brigadier , " said the doctor , and the brigadier , who had heard him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst mistake . . . . " " One thing at a time , " said the doctor . " I am almost through , I am in a hurry . " " My pencil is in a very bad condition , " said the brigadier . " May I borrow your pen , Doctor ? " The doctor looked at the clouds with his clinical eye and diagnosed : " It will rain soon , but if you can do it quickly . . . . " He gave him the pen . Now the brigadier took over and began to describe everything in detail : position of the body , of the head , removal of same by so and so ( name of father , mother , mother 's maiden name , living at . .. age . . . occupation . . . ) . How long after the accident had the head been removed ? How many yards approximately had it first been from the body ? He wrote slowly , poor brigadier , and with those peasants breathing into his neck , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see . " Please , stay clear . . . " He was embarrassed . Even the clouds were gathering around that sheet of paper and looking intently , and perhaps with intentions . . . . Then a certain word did n't want to come . .. he closed his eyes . It was important , it was all about the description of the driver 's wickedness . . . . " Thereafter . . . deserting the scene of their murderous . . . . No , not murderous . There is a better word . . . . Of their . . . of their . . . . " " Murderous is all right , " said the doctor , playing impatiently with his pad . " Thank you , thank you so much . Then THE RAIN . . . murderous act , without stopping to . . ? without stopping to . . . . " " Without stopping , " suggested the doctor in a conclusive tone . " Thank you again . That 's it . Without stopping . I hope this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you have room for me in your carriage ? " " Yes , please get in . " Before leaving , the doctor tried to put the Panama hat under the seat , but the brigadier said : " It is unsafe there , it may fly away . " So with an anguished look at the sky the doctor put it on his head again . Now they both went as if they had a very important prey ; they left with their certificate ; they disappeared into the very mouth of the storm to tell the greasy records of the old medieval town hall that this rain , without falling , had already made a victim . Quick , quick , Doctor , quick , beat your horse so it may beat the rain ; quick , trot , quick , go right into the clouds , or it will make another victim yet  --  your new Panama hat . . . . N ow it may come ! Now the Fates are appeased : the winds are all unchained . I hear a savage scream of birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in time ! The victim of the rain may stay dry to the end . The sad procession leaves : Angelina and her gift , fresh from the Fates . Oh , if she only could undo their will as she is now undoing the doctor 's work , pronouncing him alive , alive , alive . . .. " You are not dead ! " she screams . " You are not dead . . . . " Inside of her he is not , her heavy body tells , but here , who will obey her here ? Even the records in the town hall , protected by five towers and three lines of century-old walls , defended by the shining sword of the brigadier , and endorsed by the knowledge of the doctor , even the records have him dead by now . The birds , the birds again ! The rain must be quite near . But no , those too are on the road , not in the sky . I see them now : a group of women , panting , running , losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unload on him : his mother and his sisters , five in number , and two of his kids . And here they stop . " Oooh . " They look at the blood . " Oooh , they have taken him away . . . . " " Out there , " I say . " This way . . . No .. . This way . . to the cemetery . . . . " They go straight , toward the house . " The cemetery , " I shout . They curve , like birds , in a long line , and out they go , losing more cries . As if to mock them , in the sky , a similar procession of wild ducks flees in the same direction , crying too . UT who 's calling my name ? Yes , that 's my name , clearly , in the very center of the wind . . . . " Oh Sabina , oh little peasant girl from home : what are you doing here with that umbrella that is bigger than you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and she worried . And I knew you were here , so I took the umbrella and ran to meet you . . . Elia has been killed . . . Oh , but where is he ? " " Who ? " " Elia . May I see him ? " " Where is he ? " " I wo n't tell you . " " Did they take him home ? " " I wo n't tell you . " " To the cemetery ? . . . Yes , to the cemetery , I know , I can see you are smiling . I guessed right . .. Please , give me the bicycle , I promise I 'll get there before the rain . " And as I watch her run away , one drop falls on my hand . One on my face . One on the stain of blood still fresh across the road . The rain too has arrived . No one else is expected . Men at Work DILYS BENNETT LAING D ANGER , danger , oh everywhere danger . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insect bears death , the bright snake , death . Love is a vacuum . The eyes of mortals are to each other dangerous wells of pain . To be born is the great risk . Death only is no gamble . A man should be afraid to blink his eye . Like a scared mouse he might crouch in grass , waiting with famished look , for silence , to dart forth for food and then return to wait with hope for death . But man is praiseworthy . And very vile . He goes forth walking on a rope of light , not fearing to fall but seeking to murder angels . He kisses poisoned water to salute his own loved lips . He makes promises of metal and prisons of envy . He has discovered love , dreamed Christ , paid Judas , imagined freedom , pursued happiness , lost joy .
