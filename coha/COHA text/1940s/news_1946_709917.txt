txt Housewives who were clamoring for meat a few weeks ago and prepared to pay black market prices when shelves were bare under Federal controls were reluctant buyers yesterday despite large supplies . " Meat is going begging in New York City retail shops this weekend , " Joseph Belsky , international vice president of the Amalgamated Butcher Workmen of North America and Canada , AFL , said . " There is not much buying being done . It is the old story ; when a product is n't scarce the public does n't want it . " With meat pouring into the city , the local office of the United States Department of Agriculture expected the week 's receipts of Western-dressed meat to exceed 10,000,000 pounds , or 100 per cent above last week 's receipts . According to the union official , " the shoe is now on the other foot . " Heretofore , he said , consumers had protested because they could not buy beef : yesterday butchers were complaining because the public was not buying . In a market that already had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted the end of meat regulation by the Office of Price Administration , another marked drop was forecast for this week . Mr. Belsky predicted a decrease of 5 to 7 cents a pound in retail markets . Jack Kranis , president of the National Meat Industry Council , expected a similar decline . ? Vith prices already leveling off , he said , indications were that within two weeks after the election on Nov. 5 prices would " reach the old ceilings . " He added , however , that ceil- ings under the OPA , were " purely fictional " and resulted in empty display shelves and refrigerators while the black market thrived . With consumers now able to shop around in a competitive market , Mr. Kranis said , they were becoming selective in a " buyers ' market . " He declared that they wanted to see what they were getting and to make certain that prices were " reasonable . " His organization represents retailers and independent slaughterers in eight eastern States and the District of Columbia . Member restaurants in the Society of Restaurateurs also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own to force prices downward , Pau ( Henkel , president of the society , declared . Only in this way , he continued , could both consumer and restaurant operator hope to bring prices down to a " sane level . " Poor Quality of Beef He reported that only a poor quality of beef was reaching the East and that little , if any , aged , corn-fed stock was arriving in the city . Housewives , he said , also had become " educated " and refused to pay top-quality prices for commercial and utility grades being rushed to market to take advantage of present high prices on the hoof . " I think the consumers ' buyers ' strike and ours will help perceptibly in scaling prices down to a fair level , " Mr. Henkel commented . " We are attempting to ' hold the line ' on our restaurant prices the best we can . If we bought at the fantastic prices asked in the runaway market that followed the end of OPA we naturally would have had to boost prices considerably . , A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks . " Unions , restaurant and hotel operators and the industry as a whole estimated that it would be late in December before choice grades of beef came to the local market . This opinion was held also by Texas cattle raisers , considering the time needed to fatten in feeder lots grass-fed cattle that were on the ranges when controls were lifted . Sugar and Bread With the meat situation apparently tending to solve itself , the consumers ' current problem hinged on the acute scarcity of sugar . Black market quotations here and in Northern New Jersey were reported yesterday at 65 cents a pound . Many restaurants had dispensed with sugar altogether , with few protests . Herman Steen , secretary of the Millers National Federation , said yesterday that public expectation of sharp increases in retail bread prices based solely on higher flour costs had " no basis in fact . " He declared that any rises would involve an increase of considerably less than one cent for the flour that went into a loaf of bread . He emphasized , however , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher prices bakers had ' to pay for other ingredients such as shortening.
