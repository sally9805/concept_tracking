txt The consensus of the accompanying Washington press corps , as one correspondent put it , is that Senator Robert A. Taft is launching his crusade for the Republican presidential nomination with all the modesty , restraint , and subtlety of a circus calliope under a full head of steam . Certainly so tar , at least , Senator Taft has n't unfurled a political tightrope in a whole carload of press conferences and public appearances . Actually , Senator Taft is neither modest nor immodest . He is perSonally shy and intellectually self-confident . He is never consciously subtle nor deliberately blunt . He is a politician without artifice , and when he has an opinion  --  and he always has  --  his instinct is to express it . Not that Senator Taft 's outspokenness invariably makes a hit with all his listeners or with the Republican political leaders who warily are watching the mood and manner of his campaign to see how they think he and it would stand up in the presidential world series next year . A A At times it almost seems as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably that is n't quite true . What is true is that he usually is unaware of how easily and frequently he himself contributes to the public 's misunderstanding of him until he has been surprised at the public reaction and looked at what he has said the next day . Three times already on this trip Senator Taft has gone into fuller explanation of his ex7 pressed views in order to change not his original thinking , but impressions which came from what he said . He first said that he saw no reason to call a special session of Congress . He meant to say that he saw no domestic reason for calling a special session . He first said that the Taft-Hartley Act could not be made an issue in the campaign . He meant to say that the Taft-Hartley Act could not successfully be made an issue in the campaign . Then there was the press conference at which , in face of rising prices and rising shortages . Senator Taft urged people " to eat less and eat less extravagantly . " No one who heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he did n't make clear at once that he knew that some people still are not getting enough food in America , that others are getting only enough , but his expression quickly led to unfavorable publicity and to picketing placards proclaiming that Senator Taft 's cure for high prices was to " let ' em eat less. - At his next press conference , Senator Taft brought the President 's midyear economic report . read us several hundred words from it dealing with the " need for strict economy in the use of certain foods , " all to prove that there was " nothing new " in his suggestion and that , in fact , he was only following Mr. Truman in making an " absolutely identical suggestion . " What 's up , someone asked , another " me too " campaign ? * He told us that he was surprised at the prominence given his statement . No doubt he was . but he also was acting as quickly as possible to try to counter the bad headline publicity which had blown up because of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not one to talk without thinking , but at least on a trip like this , he also is not one to think much without talking . His words may be off the cuff , but few would say that his ideas are off the cuff . True , his ideas may encounter a good deal of dissent . That does n't bother him at all . His immediate difficulty is not what comes from understanding but from misunderstanding Senator Taft . But he is not going to change his political tactics . The reason is , they 're not really political tactics at all . They are just Senator Taft . Either the Republican politicians and the country are going to like him as he is or ' they are going to look elsewhere for a 1948 President . Senator Taft has ' confessed to us that he thinks he is " perhaps too frank in commenting on the issues . " But his Party and the country will , if they wish , have to take him as he is . He has no intention of changing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
