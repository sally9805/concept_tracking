The latest composition of Russia 's great Composer Sergei Prokofiev was published in Moscow last week . To the tin ear of Soviet officialdom , it was back on the Russian scale , but to Western ears , it was the most dissonant thing he had ever written . It was a letter of penitent thanks to the party for " the assistance which it is giving me to correct my mistakes " ( TIME , Feb. 23 ) . Wrote he : " The committee decision separates the gold from the dross in the composer 's work . However painful this may be for a number of composers , including myself , I welcome the decision . " <P> Prokofiev did n't show up in person to recant his sins . He was ill , the meeting was told . But he was already at work on a new opera about a Soviet pilot who learned to fly again after losing both legs . He promised to follow party directives , and use plenty of Russian folk songs . So did the other six composers spanked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khachaturian , who has always borrowed freely from Russian folk music . ) Two other composers-one was Dmitri Kabalevsky - who were not even named in the decree , confessed their errors too . <P> At week 's end , myopic little Dmitri Shostakovich marched to the platform . He knew his lines well : he had been bawled out before . Said he : " I accept the Central Committee 's decree , particularly regarding myself , as stern but fatherly care . ... A worthy reply . . . may be achieved by work-stubborn , creative , joyous work ... on new compositions which will find a path to the heart of the Soviet people . " Shostakovich was the last to recant ; now all Soviet composers could go on with their joyous labors.
