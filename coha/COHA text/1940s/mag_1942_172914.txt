Synthetic wetting agents and detergents , newcomers to industrial chemistry , have just had the biggest year in their short but lively history . Their many manufacturers relaxed momentarily last week , beamed back upon 1941 when : <P> &gt; Their U.S. production-which stood at zero as late as 1928-reached 100,000,000 lb. and was headed steeply upward into 1942 . <P> &gt; On their product was pinned 1942 's surest badge of importance : military secrecy . <P> For chemists have found many uses for these useful chemicals which are best known to the public for their most useless ability : to scuttle a duck by altering water 's surface tension and antipathy to oily feathers <P> Wetting agents now touch upon almost every aspect of life from obstetrics , where they are used as germicides , to undertaking , where they make embalming fluids more penetrating . Synthetic detergents-non-soaps with the cleansing properties of soaps-were first produced in the laboratory by the Frenchmen Dumas and Peligot in 1836 . They began their concoctions with fatty alcohols extracted from whale oil , but the product was too costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War I , when fats for soapmaking were scarce , German chemists again tried in earnest to concoct soapless soaps . Real success did not come until after the war , when they developed the sodium alkyl sulfates . Production of these substances was not practical until the 1930s , after techniques were developed which could convert fats to fatty alcohols under pressures of 10,000 to 15,000 lb. per sq . in. - 100 times the pressures which were once tops in industry . <P> Today about 1,000 different wetting agents have been made in the U.S. , are now marketed under some 270 bewildering trade names . Their chemical structure varies greatly and is quite complex . But all these compounds have one thing in common . One end of each long molecule is hydrophobic or water-hating , the other is hydrophilic or water-loving . Thus in a mixture of water and organic material such as oils , one end of the detergent molecule dissolves in the water layer , the other in the oil , breaking down the inter-surface tension or antipathy of the two substances . <P> Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break down the aversion ( wherever it occurs ) of liquid for solid , solid for solid , gas for liquid , gas for solid . So every place in industry where substances must mix , mingle and dissolve , wetting agents are being applied as fast as researchers learn how . They are used : <P> &gt; In textile making , where they help dyes to penetrate fabrics quickly and evenly . Wetting agents also aid the moth-and flame-proofing of materials . <P> &gt; In rubber making , where they help the dispersal of pigments and vulcanizing sulfur through latex . <P> &gt; In metallurgy , where they are used to help 1 ) pickling-or acid-bath cleansing-of cast metals , 2 ) spreading soldering fluxes , 3 ) cleaning metal parts before electroplating , 4 ) wetting ore particles in flotation , etc . <P> In food industries , where they efficiently remove such poisonous sprays as arsenic from fruits and vegetables-and even help mix dough thoroughly for bakers . <P> &gt; In mixing paints , enamels , printing inks , etc. , and improving their spreading .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
