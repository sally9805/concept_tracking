From Vienna , TIME Correspondent John Walker cabled : <P> When a nation and a continent are sick at soul , it may sometimes happen that some seemingly irrelevant incident , some senseless isolated instance of violence or stupidity , serves better than acres of learned analysis to yield a bright flash of insight into the breakdown of normal social and human standards . Such an incident occurred last week near Wiener-Neudorf , in Austria 's Russian zone . <P> Out on the highway , put-putting toward Vienna , was a motorcycle carrying Herman Reitman , well-known Viennese motorbike rider , and a woman companion , Katharina Grnhut . A light sedan going faster in the same direction came up from behind and apparently started to pass . Then inexplicably the vehicles swerved together , the motorcycle bounced off to the side of the road , where its two passengers lay groaning . A few passers-by ran up to them . The sedan braked to a stop farther down the road and the driver climbed out and walked back . Taking a hasty glance at the scene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot the two injured people to death . Then he walked back to his car and drove on . The witnesses were so stunned that nobody even noted his license number .
