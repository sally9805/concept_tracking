FIGHTING LIBERAL-George W. Norris-Macmillan ( $3.50 ) . <P> Eight weeks before he died , last year , in his stucco house in McCook , Neb. , the late , great ex-Senator George William Norris finished dictating his autobiography . Fighting Liberal is not a great book . His heroic battles in Congress were no longer vivid in its old ( 83 ) , tired author 's mind . Like many another old man , George Norris at the end was reliving his youth . As the story of a boyhood in the frontier , post-Civil War Midwest , Fighting Liberal is authentic Americana . <P> Frontier Mother . George Norris ' father was a farmer living in the " Black Swamp " country of northern Ohio . George was only three when his father died . But he remembered his mother well . In his recollection of her , Mary Magdalene Norris emerges as the archetype of frontier woman : <P> " Both my father and my mother were uneducated , and it was with great difficulty that they wrote their names . Both were able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found her greatest pleasure . . . . <P> " I never heard a song upon the lips of my mother . I never even heard her hum a tune . . . . She was a confusing mixture of sternness , gentleness , and strength of will and purpose . She had borne twelve children , and had buried three of them . When the harvest required it , she had taken her place in the field . She had planted and tended the vegetable garden . She had spun the cloth , and had made the clothes which my father , my sisters . . . and I wore . . . . <P> " Among my most vivid recollections . . . is of her sitting straight and rigid in a chair , reading to us from the only book in our home , the Bible . Each year she read the Bible through . On Sunday afternoons she would gather us to her side and , opening the worn pages , read for hours . It never seemed strange that , devoted Bible student that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Home 's Heritage . Young George went to country school , took part in spelling bees and won arithmetic contests , joined a debating society . Debate revolved around topics such as : " Resolved , That man is a free moral agent . " One day , in jest , he proposed the topic : " Resolved . There is more pleasure in living with a neat , cross woman than with a good-natured , slouchy woman . " In the rugged frontier , George Norris found there was no one who would defend the slouchy woman . He did , and won . <P> There was rarely any money in the Norris home . Young George remembered well the day the first coal-oil lamp arrived . He gathered and shelled hazelnuts for months to earn enough money to buy an accordion . When he got it , the first tune he played was Jesus , Lover of My Soul . <P> Despite lack of money , life in that plain farm home was good : " There on that farm I lost all fear of poverty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a great joy out of work . It never occurred to me in those years that the lack of money was of any consequence . I grew up to believe wholly and completely in men and women who lived simply , frugally , and in fine faith . I learned that fear was inspired in men and women who could not reconcile themselves to the possibility that hardship and sacrifice might confront them in battling for the right .
