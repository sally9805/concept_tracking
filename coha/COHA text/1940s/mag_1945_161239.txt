West Point and Annapolis long ago outgrew competition from civilian colleges. * Last week the two service academies looked like the best basketballers in the land . Other teams had risen only to fall ; they alone went on unbeaten . <P> The success of Army 's courtmen , unbeaten in 26 games since February 1943 , hinges on peak physical shape to go with their maximum-sized home court ( eight feet longer than Madison Square Garden 's ) . Fast-finishing Army last week whirled by Pittsburgh ( 71-to-51 ) , then dumped Rochester ( 79-to-42 ) . Their captain ( and football halfback ) , Dale Hall , leading scorer in the East last season , has flicked in no less than 142 points in ten games , to boost his team 's scoring average to 60.9 against their opponents ' 40.1 . <P> Navy , with an even more impressive scoring average of 62 to the opposition 's 39.2 , is also led by a footballer turned sharpshooter , Center ( blocking back ) Dick Duden . The Middies , using a court brand of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 55-to-47 ) and West Virginia ( 60-to-40 ) to make it nine straight . <P> Runners-Up . Few , if any , of the nation 's hundreds of college basketball teams can challenge Army and Navy 's top ranking . One of the few , Manhattan 's St. John 's ( won 14 , lost 1 ) , might even upset the applecart at West Point this week . Three other top teams put an extra sheen of gilt on their records last week : DePaul 's 6-ft. -9 Center George Mikan took the scoring honors over Oklahoma A. &; M. 's 7-ft . Bob Kurland ( TIME , Dec. 25 ) , as DePaul hung up its 15th victory ( 48-to-46 ) against one defeat . Well-balanced Iowa ( won 12 , lost 1 ) , and its Wilkinson brothers took another hitch on the Big Ten title by trimming Indiana , 45-to-40 . <P> <P> - Army swimmers last week scored a major upset , marring Yale 's 66-meet winning streak , 44-to-31.                 @ @ @ @
