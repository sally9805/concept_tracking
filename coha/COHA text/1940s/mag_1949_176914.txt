A visiting Easterner once quipped that " Los Angeles consists of 40 suburbs in search of a city . " In the search , Greater Los Angeles supports the astonishing total of 258 newspapers-including five major dailies , 17 minor ones , 71 paid weeklies and 165 giveaways . The haphazard little community giveaways , which flourish in Los Angeles as nowhere else in the country , exist on the ads of local merchants , run only community news . <P> Looking them over , bustling little James Parton got an idea . Parton , onetime Harvard cross-country runner ( ' 34 ) and wartime lieutenant colonel , had been a TIME staffer since 1935 , was then Los Angeles bureau chief . He figured that combining the most successful giveaways would be one way to establish a profitable citywide newspaper with ready-made readership and advertising revenue . <P> To give his idea a trial , Parton quit TIME last year , organized the Los Angeles Independent Publishing Co. , raised a stake from 55 investors , * and bought a chain of seven twice-a-week giveaways in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hired some high-priced talent , including ex-Hearstling Merrill Lord as general manager and the Los Angeles News 's Charles Judson as executive editor , to help turn his giveaways ( circ. 42,000 ) into good newspapers . <P> Last week Parton thought his experiment had worked well enough to expand further . For less than $500,000 , he bought the biggest U.S. giveaway-Los Angeles ' twice-a-week Down Town Shopping News+ ( circ. 500,000 ) . The Shopping News was owned by 18 Los Angeles department stores ( The Broadway , Bullock 's , May Co. , Barker Bros . ) . Parton promised to jump circulation to 600,000 and lower ad rates ; as part of the deal , the stores signed long-time advertising contracts with Parton . His expected revenue this year : more than $4,000,000 . <P> Editor &; Publisher Parton planned to merge the Shopping News with his seven other papers , call the new paper the Los Angeles Independent . He also set out to hire 50 newsmen and 150 ad salesmen . They will put out 10 to 15 semiweekly " sub-editions , " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles . All the papers will have some features ( fashions , movies , music , cartoons , etc. ) in common . Los Angeles newsmen guessed that 36-year-old Parton 's eventual aim , if the Independent succeeded , would be a citywide daily . <P> *Among them : Moviemakers Mervyn LeRoy and David Loew ; Planemaker Donald Douglas ; Firestone 's Leonard Firestone ; TIME Inc. ' s Editor in Chief Henry R. Luce . Acting as individuals , Luce and seven other TIME Inc. executives and directors bought a total of 14.6% of the stock . <P> +As part of the Parton deal , the Down Town Shopping News Corp . sold its stock in Pacific Press . ( Pacific Press , largest West Coast printing plant , prints the Shopping News , and the West Coast copies of TIME and LIFE . ) TIME Inc. bought the preferred stock ; the Clement Co. , Buffalo printers , bought the common stock .
