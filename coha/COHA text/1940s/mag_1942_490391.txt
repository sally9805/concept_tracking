WITH about seventy million oth  --  er Americans , we listened to the great geography lesson , as  --  sisted by a map of the world we 'd dipped out of a newspaper . Like every such map we can remember , it showed the Western Hemisphere complete in the middle , with Europe , Africa , and about a third of Asia on the right , and the rest of Asia and Australia on the left . There is something wrong with this conven  --  tional division , we 've concluded after several days of reflection . Not only is it had for Americans to get the idea that the world is centred approximately on Denver , Colorado , but also there is something about it that defeats any at  --  tempt to convey the idea of total military strategy to the public mind . The world to most of us is still round only in the  --  ory ; like Ferdinand and Isabella , we see it really in flat projection , with Asia eternally split somewhere along longi  --  tude 75 ? . A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margin of the page ; it takes a consider  --  able effort of the imagination to see him sailing back again on the right , safe into the Red Sea . The President ran in  --  to this difficulty when he said some  --  thing about the possibility of a junction of tha German and Japanese forces . We looked at our map and found it reassur  --  ing . Well , the bastards will have to take the Panama Canal first , we thought , determined to defend it to the end . THERE is irrelevant good cheer in the fact that neither the import nor the impact of the President 's radio talk was affected by his cold . The Voice that instructs our enemies dare not fall one decibel below its customary volume , or the people would lose the whole point of the speech . Last week a random germ forced Mr. Roosevelt the leader to go on the air without the assistance of Mr. Roosevelt the orator , and no ? body minded a bit . For the cold , if it 's still bothering him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve hours in bed . I there is in the universe any organ- / ism whose reactions are completely predictable , it is the New York cop . We could have warned those volunteer fire  --  men who tried to help out last week with the fire down on Thirty-fourth Street that one of the cops present would say , " That armband do n't mean anything to me  --  ga wan , get back ! " and that an  --  other would say , " Ga wan , ya more nuisance than ya worth ! " To explain to a cop , whose mind is full of his own murky ideology , whose every energy is devoted to his war with the civilian pop  --  ulation , that there is now another war on , that the city conceivably might be bombed , that if it is bombed there will be more fires than the regular Fire De  --  partment can handle , that the volunteer firemen will then be our only hope of saving the city , and that it is a good idea for them to get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , for one , would not care to under  --  take . It is our observation that all ab  --  stract discussion of citizens ' tights or duties is met by the jolly roundsmen with a simple , reticent " Ga wan ! " We predict that when the bombs start fall  --  ing , the cops will react by laying about with their billies , and our advice is to stay home if you do n't want to be run in . WHEN this war is over , we would n't be surprised if two vil  --  lains of it turn out to be Rudyard Kipling and Gary Cooper . Beyond almost any question , they arc the greatest authors of Anglo-Saxon complacency , and it is hard to say which is worse . The Man from Bombay , of course , got there first , establishing the ratio of white suprem  --  acy at something like ten to one and inculcating forever in British minds the notion that heathen races do n't under  --  stand machinery . Mr. Kipling left his countrymen the bow-and-arrow delu  --  sion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Cooper belongs to the same school but he is a consider  --  able refinement , the message of his art having to do sheerly with morals rather than race or equipment . He is dedicated to the theory that a virtuous man of cor rect political principles is impervious to bullets , and we have observed how that idea worked out at Pearl Harbor . We hate to tamper with the comfortable old legends , but in the interests of national defense we feel we ought to bring the odds a little more up to date . In our book , Sergeant York with a Bible and a squirrel rifle is no better than a six  --  to-five shot against Fuzzy-Wuzzy in a dive bomber , and the smart money is said to be on the colored boy . TUNCHING one day last week with a4 ' an Englishman in the English Grill at Rockefeller Plaza , we were distracted by the observation that the skaters in the sunken rink on the other side of the plate-glass window were n't keeping time to the music that was being served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waiter about it and were told that a loudspeaker connected to one canned-music studio plays for the patrons of the restaurant while a second loudspeaker attached to something else again plays for the skaters . We were shifting this fact around in our mind , looking for some explanation of this typically Amer ican duplication of effort that would be comprehensible to an Englishman , when the wind outside blew the hat off the head of a man who had been watching the skaters from the parapet over the statue of Prometheus . The hat fell tin the ice outside our window and we ob  --  served that it was a neat gray snap brim with a little blue feather in the band . A uniformed . Rockefeller lackey instantly appeared with a long bamboo pole , fitted the hat on the end of it , and handed the hat up to the man on the parapet , who put it on his head and walked off hur  --  riedly while everybody around stared at him . " Good show , this , " said the Eng  --  lishman enthusiastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word as best we could . Leigh Goes All Out L : ITEN though the big Wrigley sign is being dismantled , Broadway is not going totally dark for the duration . We base this conclusion on an interview with Douglas Leigh , the young electric-sign entrepreneur . He 'd put you up an electric sign tomorrow , and the only notice he 'd take of the war would be to write into the contract a provision for a pro-rata rebate in case of an all-night blackout . This wholesome confidence results from the fact that Leigh is wired for an instantaneous blackout of all his signs , which now number sixteen . Iii his office at Rockefeller Center , and in the bowels of the Wilson 's Whiskey sign on Times Square , are twin master switches which will turn any one or all of the signs off in a trice . The installa  --  tion set Leigh back about a thousand dol  --  lars , but he regards this as a good invest  --  ment . " I never spent a grand more cheerfully , " he remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the jargon of the electrical world is connected by leased telephone wires to each sign ; telephone wires can be used for this purpose , but do n't , please , ask us how . There are two monitors because at night , when blackouts most often oc  --  cur , there is seldom anybody in Leigh 's office . The Wilson monitor is manned by a Mr. Mueller , and in case of an air raid the responsibility would be his . The other electric-sign operators in New York have been told by Mayor La  --  Guardia to get busy and install master switches similar to Leigh 's on their dis  --  plays . Leigh figures that if there ever is a full blackout , he will be dark before the traffic lights , street lamps , and oth  --  er municipal installations . Last Sunday night , between 8:15 and 8:22 o'clock , he gave a test demonstration , and Ev erything went according to plan , includ  --  ing the bewilderment of several people on their way to the Paramount . Both monitors are so well hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in hack of the Wilson sign , you could n't find them . This is a precaution against sabotage . Leigh buoyantly informed us that even if we had a perpetual blackout , the way they do in London , he would re  --  main in the sign business . He points to the soldier in his Times Square cigarette billboard , eternally blowing smoke rings , and the steaming coffeepot further up the street . " They are already function  --  ing with maximum daylight effective  --  ness , " he says . " We can go further if neon lighting has to lie ruled out . We can put a wooden pendulum on the Gillette sign , in place of the neon one we have now . We can have flags blown by compressed air . There are a thousand and one ways to throw the emphasis on daylight effectiveness . " Leigh , incident  --  ally , has been dollar-a-yearing for the Treasury Department since Pearl Har  --  bor , with two titles , self-explanatory and , says Leigh , synonymous : Special Consultant to the Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Outdoor Advertising , Car Cards , Truck Posters , Spectaculars , and Small Sign Companies . He prefers the latter title , as being more lucid . Full Circle AN imposing lady  --  not to mince words , a dowager  --  came sailing into the headquarters of one of the local civilian-volunteer units to offer her ser  --  vices . She looked at the rows of desks , where many ladies were typing , tele  --  phoning , and working mimeographs . " It reminds me so much of the last time , " she sighed , " when we were all helping Mr. Wilkie . " Good Listener AMAN who can get the occult for you wholesale is Mr. Ed Bodin , whose practice as an authors ' agent leaves him time to conduct a clearing house for visitations , dreams , and other kinds of messages from the Somewhere Else . We called an him recently , and he set us straight on one point right at the start . " I am not a nut , " he told us . Mr. Bodin 's boulevard of significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny office at 105 West Fortieth Street , where he shares a suite with the Orlin Trim Publishing Company . His project is designed to advance the war effort . " Not all nightmares , " he said , " are from sex or indigestion , so why ignore them ? " With this thought as a major premise , he told us , he let it be widely known some weeks ago that he would welcome news of all signs , por  --  tents , and predictions that seemed to pertain to the war , figuring that if he could turn up a dreamer of consistent accuracy , he would earn a nation 's grati  --  tude . He has already earned the grati  --  tude of close to three hundred dreamers , accurate or otherwise , who have seized happily upon his proffered ear . He showed us a few sample war forecasts , the most specific of which came from a Mrs. Gaze , of Amsterdam Avenue , who had got word in her sleep that the Japa  --  nese would make a surprise attack on Guatemala and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attack , she thought , would come around next Tuesday , March 10th . " I generally try to pin them down , " Mr. Bodin explained to us . When he gets them to write down places and dates he has the predictions witnessed by a notary public . Mr. Bodin , who is a solid , unethercal  --  looking man with glasses , has won the confidence of hyper-visionary folk through years of steady inability to change the subject or go away when they begin their stories . This reversal of the curse of the Ancient Mariner first fell upon him in the science laboratory of the North Plainfield , New Jersey , high school , where he was a student a little over thirty years ago . He was fooling with a static machine one day when an  --  other fellow opened the door and said something to him . He was sore at be  --  ing interrupted and therefore pleased as well as startled to see the door slam on the other fellow without prompting from any known human or natural force . Since then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this experience or a similar experience of his own . Or just an experience . Mr. Bodin was a gas officer in the 68th Coast Artillery during the last war and told us that he came hack with four hundred coincidences . He subsequently wrote ghost stories for the pulp maga  --  zines and a book called " Scare Me , " dealing with black magic , werewolves , and zombies . Mr. Bodin feels that he is qualified to talk on all these subjects , and more . " I know three thousand mystic stories , " he said to us . Most of his in come , however , derives from the fees he collects for selling other writers ' stuff to magazines . Mr. Bodin 's call for inspired hunches on the war has netted him a few specimens which we made note of , al  --  though they do seem vague . One man says that Hitler will die around June or July , another that Mussolini will soon he very sick , a third predicts a gas at  --  tack on this country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be destroyed by an earthquake . This last agrees with what certain Tibetan monks have been saying all along , which Mr. Bodin feels gives it more than aver  --  age likelihood . " Those monks are considered tops in mysticism , " he told us . Salutation A BLAMELESS fellow we know recently found in his morning mail the cata  --  logue of a printing house which apparently devotes itself to dirty hooks . There was a covering letter , too , as  --  suring him that any items he cared to order would arrive promptly , in a plain wrap  --  per . It began , breezily , " Dear Erato-bibliophile . . . " Tea TEA ' we find , isnot one of the things you have to worry about  --  or any  --  how not much . A nasty little splurge of hoarding resulted from a newspaper story that we had only a six months ' supply left . In no time at all , we had only a three months ' supply left . Now , however , imports from such regular sources as are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to normal and should continue to supply us through 1942 , if Aunt Mary will un  --  freeze that five pounds in the attic . This cheering but not inebriating news comes from an organization of importers called the Tea Bureau . The Tea Bureau , or at least the spokesman whom we inter  --  viewed , seems to be calm and optimistic . The only complication is that oolong tea , which came mostly from the Japa  --  nese island of Formosa , and green tea , which came mostly from Japan itself , will be scarcer for the duration . As a nation , we prefer black tea , the official score being five to one over the two other varieties , and this is still arriving in quantity from India and Ceylon . Eight hundred million pounds of tea is the normal annual world consump  --  tion by Occidentals . Great Britain used to take more than half of it and we ran a poor second with'one hundred mil  --  lion pounds . Hostilities with Japan cut off about a fifth of our supply . Now Java @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Japan , have become uncertain quantities , but fortunately Ceylon and India have been able to expand their exports and are setting out extra plants to take care of the bal  --  ance of our requirements . The demand for green tea and oolong can well be met . Tea is tea ; whether it 's finally called black , green , or oolong depends merely on how it 's prepared . Black tea is fermented before drying , green tea is not ; oolong is a kind of compromise be  --  tween the two processes . Names like orange pekoe and souchong refer only to the size of the leaf after treatment Tea lore : Bushes a hundred years old are still bearing ; tea can be har  --  vested every two weeks from the same bush ; if a bush is left untended , it grows up into a tree and becomes commercially useless ; China once supplied ninety-nine per cent of our tea but now drinks al  --  most all she raises ; there are a hundred and sixty cups of tea in a pound of leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of caffeine and two grains of tannin ; in Tibet they take butter made from goats ' milk in their tea , and in some parts of China the boiled leaves are made into patties , with salt , garlic , and dried fish ; next to water , tea is the most popular beverage in the world , and Americans drink enough every year to overflow the Central Park reservoir , or to float the Normandie , if she can be floated . Imported . WE 'VE heard from a naval officer WE 'VE who got promoted recently , which necessitated a reshuffling of his insignia . When his stars were removed , he found , on the back of each , a label reading " Made in Japan . " He sent one to us , for evidence . You can come and look at it , but we would n't part with it for anything . Newcomers WE made a neighborly call on the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor , which has just moved into town in order to leave more floor space in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six floors at 1560 Broadway , near- Forty-sixth Street . We had a talk with the Divi  --  sion 's Mr. Mullady , who has the tide of Acting Director of the Information Branch . Mr. Mullady , an old City News boy who used to cover City Hall , was not displeased at getting hack to New York , except that he had just bought a nice little country place in Vir  --  ginia and had intended to settle down there with his bride , some chickens , and a bull pup . That will have to wait . Of the two hundred-odd Wage and Hour folk thus transplanted , few had ever so much as visited New York before , Mr. Mtdlady told us . He thinks he 's the only native New Yorker among the depart  --  ment heads and figures that probably every state in the Union is represented in the personnel . Some of the staff who just could n't face the prospect of leav  --  ing ' Washington managed to get trans  --  ferred to other bureaus , their places be  --  ing filled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that the move was accomplished with efficiency and dispatch . It was an  --  nounced on December 20th that the Division would leave Washington . Pittsburgh was the first choice for the new location , but on January 30th word was given that New York had been definitely chosen . Outriders immediate  --  ly were sent up here to compile a list of desirable hotels , furnished rooms , and apartments for temporary residence , and the members of the staff made their selections sight unseen . At 1 P.M. Sat  --  urday , February 14th , work was sus  --  pended in Washington , and it was re  --  turned in New York at 9 A.M. the following Tuesday . Sixty-one trailer trucks were required for the office furni  --  ture and equipment . Mr. Mullady , re  --  calling that it once took five days to move from one set of offices to another in Washington , could n't say enough for the movers . The personnel and its bag  --  gage came up mostly over the weekend by train , bus , and automobile . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hour Division got a royal welcome . On their first day at work , they were addressed by Mayor LaGuardia and George A. Sloan , the New York City Commissioner of Com  --  merce . There was also a basketful of passes to theatres , movies , the opera , the Empire State observatory , and the dining rooms of many of the midtown hotels , for a meal on the house . Every  --  body had some sort of treat his first evening in the city . One secretary re  --  ported with satisfaction that while she was dining at the Martinique , she was approached by a foreign-looking man who addressed her as " Madame " and in  --  sisted on buying her a drink . We heard of one confused young Wage and Hour lady who , having been forewarned that New York taxi-drivers expected tips , tipped the conductor of a Broadway streetcar . " He kept it , too , " Mr. MuI  --  lady told us indignantly . We drew out a couple of girls working at nearby desks . Miss Whelan , a native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euwar , of Vandergrift , Pennsylvania , said it was roomier here . That shows what Washington has turned into , when New York seems roomy . Exclusive AN eager lady , an amateur social I X- worker , recently visited the editor of the woman 's page of a local news  --  paper with a request that something nice be written about a girls ' reformatory she was somehow tied up with . " It ought to be a very good story , " she said . " You see , we are privately endowed , and we get the cream of the delinquents . " Free Speech ONE afternoon last week we went a few blocks out of our way to look in on Union Square , wondering what effect a state of war has had down there . It was a particularly cold day and such of the boys as were present were gath  --  ered in a knot by the statue of Washington toward Fourteenth Street , their coat collars turned up and most of them shuffling and stamping their feet . A few had soapboxes along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fessionally , the gather  --  ing of philosophers be  --  ing quite informal . An aloof cop , as cold as everybody else , stood some fifty- yards off , looking steadily the oth  --  er way . As we joined the knot , the first words we heard were " And you think the newspa  --  pers are right , all of a sudden ? " This question was put by a little man in a tan overcoat who was smiling happily . " Of course not , " said a man with pink cheeks and no hat . " I 'm only saying those are the re  --  ports . The Russians must make a frontal at tack on Rzhev . " " They must do so why ? " asked the smiling man , looking even happier . " Those newspapers of yours say that they have surrounded the city . Maybe they will by-pass it . " " They must attack anyway , " said the one with pink cheeks . " The Germans can get food from the air . A blockade is no good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or infirmity , kept one eye closed , turned on the little smiling one and said angrily , " Everybody knows they must attack but you . Why ? " The little man still smiled firmly . The group was joined by a new arrival who wore a chesterfield , a dark-blue scarf , and a black fedora . He came from the direction of Fourteenth Street and started talking as soon as he was in range . " So you are all still here , " he said with a pronounced Italian accent . " I have conic from Los Angeles . " The smiling man looked at the newcomer 's trousers , which were light blue and ap  --  peared to be of some thin material , and said , " Very summery . Nice , but out of place . " The newcomer ignored this ob  --  servation . Speaking to the convention at large , he announced that he had been unable to land a job in Los Angeles . " It ? is because I was born in Italy , " he ex  --  claimed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Italy , but only if you have a very special skill . I have been a mechanic for five years but that is not enough for them . " " It 's a rule of the government , " said the man with pink cheeks . " The government is O.K. , " said the Italian . " It 's the companies . I never thought I would say so , but the government is O.K. " " You are a pa  --  triot , " said the smiling man . This seemed to outrage the Italian . " Why am I a patriot ? " he wanted to know . " I state a simple fact , and Pm a pa  --  triot ! " " No offense , " said the smiling man . We drifted over toward a pair who were somewhat detached from the rest and listened to one of them discuss the German personality . He carried a cane and smoked a cigarette in a holder . " Look at the great thinker , Nietzsche , " he concluded . " The same thing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crazy house , " said the other man . " That 's very true , " the first one said . " Well , I must be going . I must find a pet shop . " He moved off at a fast walk . We started uptown ourself , just as a ? couple of young men on roller skates came coasting by . " Look out , I 'm a tank ! " one of them yelled to the assem  --  bled group . A tall man whom we had n't noticed before called out , " If you 're an American tank , there ai n't enough of you , you ai n't got enough guns , and your armor plate 's no good ! " We came away feeling that all was reasonably well in the Square . Peek THIS happened in a chophouse , the name of which , after due reflec  --  tion , we have decided to withhold . One day , at lunch , a regular patron looked up from the menu and said irritably , " What the hell is tripe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always seeing it in menus and I do n't even know what it looks like . " The waiter pondered , then sur  --  reptitiously pointed out a solitary cus  --  tomer who had just seated himself at a nearby table . " I 'll talk that gentle  --  man into ordering it , " he said . He did , too , and on the way back from the kitch  --  en he stopped at the curious one 's table , lifted the dish cover , and said , " That 's what it looks like , sir . "
