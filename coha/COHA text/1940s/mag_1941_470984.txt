N sun-drenched high desert country I dotted with sagebrush , with a purple butte jutting forth on the horizon forty miles away like a two-dimensional cutout before light-blue sky in which a few lazy , white , billowing , cumulus clouds float , there are only the vast expanse of mesa , the sun 's hot rays , the redolent air , and the soft cool whisper of a breeze . That 's at first glance . Time and an awakening sense perception later reveal two Indians , a man and a woman , sitting before their circular but of mud and wattles ? a hogan . Their gaudy black-and-red blankets partially hooding their heads are no more gaudy than the colors splashed over the scene by the red earth , the blue sky , the purple butte , and the white clouds .

Tourists like it , natives like it ; only the Indians and Junior are impervious to it . If you visit the Southwest you are bound to run into it in some form or version sooner or later . And oddly enough , it is just . The anomalies , the ambiguities , the incongruities of the modern Southwest are in it . In a quintessential sense this foolish story is an index to the whole region . And what exactly does it mean , this word Southwest ? California ? Only a small part . Texas ? Only a smaller part . But it does mean all of New Mexico and Arizona and some portions of Nevada and Utah . For a quick estimation take all of New England , New York , New Jersey , and Pennsylvania ? double it ? and the area would still be enclosed by the American Southwest .

It is one thing for Henry Chee Dodge , venerable and nominal chief of the Navajos , who can recall the slaughter of his people in the Canyon del Muerto , their internment at Bosque Redondo in New Mexico ( to-day such would be called a concentration camp ) , and the white warrior called **25;0;TOOLONG by some and called Kit Carson by others ? yes , one thing for Henry Chee Dodge , but quite another for his son Tom Dodge , a practicing attorney and graduate of Harvard University ( Junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining-car waiters on the Santa Fe 's Super Chief , but it was quite another for the first Negro who entered Arizona in 1539 , one Esteban de Do-ratites , who was so eager to be taken for a god that he wore feathers and gourds and rattles on his six-foot frame and put on such a bravura act that the very sensible Zuni Indians drove a couple of arrows straight through him . It is one thing for a solitary pick-canteen-andburro prospector far out in the desert mountains of Harquahala or Harcuvar searching for the gold that can never make him happy ; and quite another for the archeologist or ethnologist following in the prospector 's very tracks , caring not for gold but rising into ecstasy if he discovers the tibia or ulna of one of the Ancient Ones , the Hohokam , who built the government-protected ruins of Casa Grande perhaps ten centuries ago .

And so , in 1941 , the American Southwest is a land of contrasts , not only in its natural colorings as in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of New Mexico or in the Painted Desert of Arizona , but a land of contrasts in its people and their habits and customs and behavior . A bronc buster , a schoolteacher , a Chinese laundryman , a blanket Indian , a contemporary painter , a Las Vegas gambler , a nationally known poet , a drunken Mexican , a lovely senorita , a sunburnt truck driver ? Mormon , Catholic , Jew ? red men , black men , white men ? Southwesterners . If this is the hors d'oeuvre , how do we find the entire repast ?

The train is too fast , and the plane is faster still . Let either of them take you to the Southwest ; but once at the borders , borrow , hire , or buy a car and cruise about for yourself . Remember that much of the terrain is desert country and , while you may expect no more trouble in the Rio Grande valley than you would expect between New York and Montauk , it is best to carry five gallons of water and a little food if you are the kind of traveler who likes to get off the main and secondary roads . Incomprehensible as it may seem , I have even heard strangers inquire as to the safety of entering the Indian country . Now there are many Indian reservations in the Southwest , of which the Navajo , the Papago , and the Hopi are the largest ( the first two are about the size of Connecticut and the third that of Rhode Island ) ; and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , and should you have any trouble of any kind , bless the fact that the Indians are there . If you do n't get excited and talk too abruptly or too fast , Mr. Indian will be quick to understand and invariably willing to help . The old bloodcurdling and savage redskin has evolved into a very decent sort of fellow . You will like him . You may even tell him so . But you 'll never discover what he thinks of you . He 's either too polite , too shy , or too sagacious . A comprehensive tour of the Southwest , seeing all and missing nothing , has never been made by anybody . A lifetime would not afford time enough , for it is impossible to exhaust the great past and the evolving present of this country . But driving through in a kind of leisurely circle tour at your own pace and looking at the things which interest you are both pleasant and profitable , and you can get a good quick impression of the country in a week , and a decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are sure to return later , so it really matters little if your first exposure be short or long . The eastern flank of the Southwest may arbitrarily be said to be the eastern boundary of New Mexico , but this is really not good sense . Texas and the Southwest simply merge somewhere in west Texas . If you are driving westacross Texas you suddenly know when you are in the Southwest . It is a matter of elevation , topography , and to some extent flora and fauna . Running down the middle of the United States from the Dakotas to the Rio Grande is a line of demarcation , geographically undefined , but plain enough to anyone who knows the West . SuddenIy ? you 're in it . Approaching New Mexico from the north , however , the boundary is definite . It is the famous Raton Pass . Trinidad , in Colorado , is definitely a Western town . But Raton ( pronounced locally RA " - toon ' ) , only a few miles south over the almost 8,000-foot grade , is definitely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southwestern earth , we 'll make a great loop through the entire area , hitting the high spots , so to speak , in order that on a second trip we may concentrate on one or two phases of the first general impression . It may be best to begin by leaving the main road at once . We sha n't wade in ; rather we 'll plunge into Southwestern atmosphere by driving from Raton to Taos . There may be some people who have never heard of this tiny city named for Don Fernando de Taos , but they are few . More common are those who have heard of it but do not know how to pro-. nounce it . Taos is an art colony ( of a kind ) and Taos rhymes with louse . Apart from coincidence in pronunciation and some incredibly bad art , there is nothing else especially parasitic about the community . In the minds of strangers to the Southwest , Taos and the adjacent country are associated with Tony Luhan , Mabel Dodge Luhan , and Frieda and D. H. Lawrence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taos will forever set in your memory this quiet , sun-bathed adobe town with a Spanish heritage so ingrained that a few modern names and gasoline pumps can never quite overcome the atmosphere of walled patios , shuttered windows , and the smell of tortillas . All tourists are bound to see the Taos Indian Pueblo three miles north of the town . The Taos Indians treat the outlander very courteously . He is shown a few commonplace bits of pueblo life , permitted to spend a little change on some souvenirs , and sent on his way . It 's as efficiently done as a government tour of Boulder Dam . Nevertheless , if you 've not seen a pueblo , I recommend you begin with this one . One other outstanding citizen of Taos is , for some odd reason , rarely associated with the town . He was the famous and intrepid Kit Carson who lived here for many years , and for many years after his death his widow continued to reside in his house .

Santa Fe should be experienced by everyone some time in his life . It is more than the capital of New Mexico ( in fact that does not matter , and you may visit the town and never see the capitol building at all ) ; it is the capital of the whole Southwest . To visit this region of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe before the present war and not seeing Paris . The Royal City , as it was once called in Spanish , has its Avenue du Bois in the form of El Camino del Monte Sol ( all comparisons being relative to the fact that France resembles New Mexico in no way whatsoever ) , its Montmartre in the region round Burro Alley , its chestnut trees in the form of poplars , its Porte St. Denis vice in the " bad " houses on lower San Francisco Street , its Louvre in the old Palace of the Governors and as for taxis , they are equally decrepit and driven with equal neurosis in both capitals . On a Saturday night ? or most any night for that matter ? the Spanish custom of couples walking together around the plaza but segregated as to sexes , boys clockwise and girls counter-clockwise , giggling and prattling in Spanish high glee as they walk round and round , still persists in 1941 . As in most Spanish cities , the plaza is the heart of town . No matter what you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin here . Among the usual but very worthwhile attractions adjacent to the city are the Indian pueblos of Tesuque , San Ildefonso , and the dying Nambe . Then there is El Rito de los Frijoles ? the canyon of the bean people with its erstwhile residential caves and its partially restored and honeycombed communal house and its ceremonial kiva . For corollary reading on the bean people there is Bandelier 's The Delight Makers . Another attraction of Santa Fe not generally mentioned is its early morning light . It is really worth getting up before sunrise in this country to see the dawn burst and to watch the cool breeze and the sunlight dance among the leaves of the poplar trees . Witter Bynner , who is not only Santa Fe 's poet , but America 's poet , has sung of it once and for all . On second thought it is not likely that you will miss the dancing light in the poplar trees ; you will either go to bed in time to get up for it , or you are the kind of person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you will naturally be up all night anyway . One word of caution : do not look at Santa Fe hastily and criticize it in your bitter disappointment . All I have said of it is true , and more . It is up to you to tune yourself to it . If you ca n't you belong in Albuquerque . Once , while sitting alone in the plaza , two local citizens of what might be called Santa Fe 's proletariat spoke to me ( I was obviously a stranger ) with civic pride . Their descriptions were succinct and had bite . They were literally these : " No town like it . You can be hollerin ' one minute and dead the next . " And the second : " Well , it 's a great little city . It may not always be great but it 'll always be a city . " I am convinced both statements are utterly veracious . Southward down the valley of the Rio Grande is Albuquerque ( pronounce it Al ' - bu- ker- key ) and it would be pleasant to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice one can not . It is a health resort ( so is Santa Fe of course ) and seat of the University of New Mexico , and of a government Indian school , and is a clean , attractive city founded well over two hundred years ago . Albuquerque has all but one asset ? it lacks color . Nearby , however , is Isleta Indian Pueblo , and I believe you should go to this without benefit of any preconceived notion or comment . Remember itIsleta ? and ask all the questions you want , for the replies may shock you . Southward flows the Rio Grande down through the heart of New Mexico and the Spanish towns of Socorro and Las Cruces . Easterly some hundred and fifty miles flows the Pecos River more or less paralleling the Rio Grande . There are good roads leading over to this valley and to the town of Roswell and the Carlsbad Caverns National Park . A swing through this section of New Mexico is worth the trip , and is practically a " must " if you are a stalactite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited in time , Carlsbad is slightly off the main line and can be saved for a return visit . In either event , both roads will take you into the Texas city of El Paso on the Rio Grande with Ciudad Juarez and what is called " Old Mexico " across the international bridge . Do n't be fooled ; the border towns are not " Old Mexico . " They are for the most part scrawny and dirty , and while Juarez is a slight exception , and Nogales in Sonora is a definite exception , most border towns are hardly worth a look . Oki Mexico begins far south of the border . Most of the trip III still lies to the west of El Paso , and back in New Mexico we cross the Continental Divide between Deming and Lordsburg and enter Arizona by way of Douglas and Bisbee . The latter is a copper town and lies sprawled in a long canyon ? a town mostly main street and either all up hill or down . And not much farther on is Tombstone . Tombstone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town too tough to die " is its thrasonical brag , and among its varied attractions of a West that once was wild there survives its newspaper , the justly famous Tombstone Epitaph which has never missed an issue since 1880 and is pleased to state that it has reported more brawls , fights , shootings , stabbings , murders , robberies , hangings , holdups , and plain " human cussedness " than any other paper " this side of hell . " No doubt this is true . Tombstone came about in 1877 because one Ed Schieffelin , a prospector , found horn silver in the hills of Cochise County , and in a matter of hours the rush was on . In spite of its name the town has a salubrious climate . Schieffelin had been told that he would never find silver but that he would find his grave . When the boom was on the district became known as Ed Schieffelin 's tombstone and the name stuck . The history of Tombstone is an example of the development of many Western mining towns . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millionaires overnight . The very ground on which you trod might be worth a fortune -- or it might not . Money was to be made , spent , squandered , flung to the winds , and then made all over again : This was the old West which still persists in the pages of pulp fiction written today , more often than not , by young men in tortoiseshell glasses who have never been west of Brooklyn 's Borough Hall . " Three shots rang out in the clear night air . Three corpses lay on the saloon floor while Mexican Pete with an evil eye and a cigarette between his grinning lips sneered Taka dat , gringoes ' and young Sheriff Blake leaped for his mount . . " and so forth . Yet that kind of thing was really life in Tombstone . Of landmarks in 1941 there are many and changes have been few . Toughnut Street still remains , but Lucky Cuss Street has become Charleston Road , and Trigger Alley has disappeared . To-day this little town of 800 people ( in its heyday it supported 15,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , sleeps in the Arizona sun and dreams of its past . Many motorists speed through without knowing where they are , but those who stop to take a look are rewarded . There is the Crystal Palace Bar , opened in 1880 and still boasting to-day that " you can buy anything your heart desires in the form of liquor and you will be shown all the courtesy and hospitality that is true of the great West . " There is ? or was ? the Can-Can restaurant , run in its prime by a Chinese , Ah Lum . This was the joy of epicureans in the Southwest ? only the finest sea foods , fresh vegetables , and meats were served , and if there was a delicacy between the gourmet 's paradise of San Francico and Antoine 's in New Orleans , the Can-Can had it . To-day , alas , the Can-Can houses the Tombstone Rifle and Pistol Club and the usual Saturday night dance whose participants drink such things as gin and Coca-Cola . Gone are the champagnes and blue points and caviar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only a block away is an edifice famous in American theatrical history ? the Bird Cage Theater . A book should be written on the history of the Bird Cage , but even in our brief glimpse welearn that it holds the record for keeping its doors open to the public . For three years , both day and night , and long before the era of Actor 's Equity , the Bird Cage never closed . This is better understood when we learn that it was also a saloon as well as a theater ? but , nevertheless , a record it is . Plays were produced , but in the swift tempo of life in Tombstone the big demand was for vaudeville , and the names of past stars who come most readily to Tombstone minds in 1941 are Eddie Foy and Lotta Crabtree . If you pause for more than a few minutes in the town you are bound to be shown the O.K. Corral , scene of the famous Earp-Clanton street fight in 1881 , which took place in thirty seconds accompanied by the roar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two wounded and which has been re-fought and re-argued these sixty years . The best way to recapture the spirit of this imbroglio is to ask for an account of it from any two of Tombstone 's older citizens . The town was completely divided on the issue , and you will see at once that you have been merely the match which has relit the flame . This will give you the spirit of the fight , but if you want the facts and for a mixture of cold-blooded murder , ruthless courage , hate , fear , and a dash of cowardice the story , as an analysis of infantilism , is worth hearing ? ask editor Clayton A. Smith of the present-day Epitaph . There remains the graveyard on the right as you drive west out of town . This too is worth a passing glance , and those who love to copy statements from cenotaphs and headstones will do well to carry a notebook and pencil . This is the famous " boothill " cemetery , so-called because most of its permanent residents died with their boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you have left Tombstone to its childhood nostalgia and you are well on the way to the attractive modern city of Tucson . Tucson 's modernity is of the spirit ; historically it is almost two hundred and fifty years old . It was originally a walled city and resembled in every way a town of old Spain . It has changed allegiance a number of times and over it have flown the flags of Spain , Mexico , the Stars and Bars of the Confederacy , and the Stars and Stripes of the Union . During the Civil War Tucson was decidedly pro-South . A detachment of Confederate cavalry occupied the town and a skirmish between the Blue and the Gray took place at Picacho Pass not far to the west . That any part of the Civil War was fought in Arizona surprises many people . It seems hardly necessary to tell anybody that Tucson is pronounced Toosahn ' , but more interesting is the fact that this name is neither Spanish nor English but is derived from the Indian Stjukshon , meaning Place Where the Water Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but because of its Confederate sympathy the town was punished by having this governmental institution withheld . Prescott won the honor , and later of course Phoenix . Tucson , however , was subsequently thrown a bone in the form of education and is to-day the site of the excellent University of Arizona . The town is blessed with a splendid climate and has always kept pace with the times . In 1941 it is not only one of the most attractive communities in the Southwest , but one of the most pleasant of the smaller cities in the United States . And it remains so without losing its distinction and color ? Mexicans , miners , tourists , Papago Indians , Eastern millionaires , cowboys , co-eds , and dudes all may be seen within a single block , a curious blending of metropolitan overtone and deeply rooted Southwestern provincialism . South from Tucson , on the Mexican border , is Nogales ( No-gahr-leez ) , Spanish for walnuts . The town is in no sense attractive to the eye , but across the line is Nogales , Sonora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sip tequila and make a face over it , and dine very well indeed in the famous Cavern Cafe , formerly a jail tunneled into rock which once incarcerated the great Geronimo , the Apache Indian warrior who ran the United States Army ragged trying to catch him . Geronimo , incidentally , was not long in this jail . You may enjoy quail or venison at the spot where he was chained with only bread and water . Nogales , Arizona , has a bit of history that is significant . It was the rise of the curtain on a four-hundred-year-old pageant called The Winning of the West . Fray Marcos de Niza and the black Esteban came through here in 1539 . They were the first European and the first African ? the first white man and the first black man ? to enter what has become the American Southwest . There is a monument to this exploit at the little-known settlement of Lochiel . A year later , 1540 , Fray Marcos de Niza returned ( Esteban had been killed by the Zunis ) leading El Capitan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians was the religious motive , but even stronger was the Spanish desire for gold . Coronado was looking for the non-existent Seven Cities of Cibola , all of which were reputedly paved with gold and decorated with silver and studded with jewels . Instead , Fray Marcos and Coronado found only a scattering of Indian tribes , and the great cities of wealth turned out to be the mud and pottery of Zuni Pueblo . With this expedition came the first horses and cattle into the Southwest . The horse and the cow , the hallmark of the West , were therefore brought by men who knew not what they were doing or what they were seeking , or that the full effect of the next four hundred years was to be due to their misdirected purpose . Like Columbus , they never fully understood what they had begun . So , pause for an instant in the narrow pass in the brown hills , in which is situated Nogales , and recall to yourself , " Here , over four hundred years ago , before there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already begun to feel the impact of European civilization . " Iv Then go on . Casa Grande , Phoenix , Ajo , Wickenburg , Salome , Yuma , all lie before you , and each has a gem to offer and you can not possibly , on such a quick survey trip , begin to call upon them all . Just about this time you resolve to return to the Southwest , and you mean it . It is now a case of letting your taste or the toss of a coin dictate your route . If it 's Indians you want you are very near the Papago reservation and some fine basket work , and this will lead you through to Ajo ( Spanish for garlic ) , the copper town where benevolent capitalism under Phelps-Dodge has built something akin to a model community . Ajo with its great copper pit , its trains , pumps , refineries , and its capital-andlabor problem so balanced that the weight of a thread might upset it , represents the corporate Twentieth Century ? about as great a contrast to the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the forty-eight States . Ajo is worth a look ; and your opinion of it will be determined by whether you stand far to the right or far to the left of an ideological center . Then there is Casa Grande where an unknown race built a civilization on a communal basis at least seven centuries ago and probably more . Casa Grande is now a national monument and the government has protected the four-storey edifice made of caliche ( an Arizona adobe ) and is ready and willing to answer all your questions except those archeological riddles to which there are as yet no answers . Phoenix is a Southwestern metropolis where you may live in any style your pocketbook permits , from squatters ' camp to Jokake Inn which , with its bar beside the swimming pool , is more of a bit of Long Island brought to Arizona than anything indigenously Southwestern . But , if you are homesick , here is an Eastern outpost . The desert country rolls on westward , and it is possible to cross the Colorado River at Yuma or Blythe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is still the Southwest rather than the coastal plane and the orange belt . The great Colorado and Mojave Deserts of southeastern California are contiguous to Arizona and Nevada . In the former there are rich reclaimed desert lands due to irrigation and with them the mysterious by-product , the Salton Sea . Farther to the northwest , where the coast range halts the desert 's advance , is Palm Springs catching the Hollywood overflow . Since we are not going into the heart of Southern California on this trip , it is best to swing north , possibly by way of the strange town of Twentynine Palms and on across the Mojave to Victorville . Here there are plenty of guest ranches , the most notable of which perhaps is Rancho Yucca Loma . You will find this an ideal spot in which to catch your breath , to turn your back for the moment on sightseeing , and let the desert speak to you . Yucca Loma , then , or the Victorville area in general is the western spearhead of this junket unless you simply must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quiet of the at once stark and beautiful Mojave in the spring , there will be thousands of wild flowers quite astonishing to your expectations of what a desert can be . But the mysterious and weird Joshua trees are always present , and if you catch them silhouetted before a rising moon you may join the coterie of desert addicts who are willing to swear that they have seen the dance of the Joshuas . In the vast open area of the desert you are inclined to look for drama in the vista ? staggering expanses of space , and far on the horizon , but seemingly near because of the clear air , a jagged range of mountains , the Coxcombs , the Sheep Holes , or the Chocolates . But stand on the " knoll " at Yucca Loma , drink in the desert , and then look down at your feet . Drama will be there too ? a myriad of tiny desert plants , both delicate and hardy , fighting for their lives and winning . Of this Wordsworth might well have conceived his famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears . The Mojave River flows out of the San Bernardino Mountains and on into the desert until it goes underground and disappears forever in Soda Dry Lake . On across the desert to the northeast is Nevada , and just beyond the State line is Las Vegas , the Monte Carlo of the Southwest . Here the chief businesses are marriage , divorce , gambling , and liquor , and they are all open twenty-four hours a day . In fact , many of the gambling houses and the saloons in Las Vegas have no doors . Why should they ? It is always warm , if not plain hot , and people are coming and going day and night . A door would only be a nuisance . Not far away is a Southwestern " must " ? the Boulder Dam . Here , in a setting that vies with scenes from Dante 's " Inferno , " engineering skill has created an object of both utility and art . It is a Twentieth-Century temple in the same sense as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple to the Eighteenth Century . At Boulder City nearby , and at the dam itself , the government has arranged tours and explanations and taken care of all factual information . If you arc interested in bathing in Lake Mead , which is backed up by the dam , it is quite possible , as is fishing and a boat trip on up the lake to the point where the raging Colorado is constantly flowing in , somewhat surprised at what has been done to it , and bringing along a silt deposit that in forty years is going to offer another major problem . Uncle Sam has tamed the Colorado , the bad boy river of the Southwest . The only question is whether the river knows it . Northeast from Las Vegas on a S. Highway 91 is Bunkerville , as odd as its name , and farther still we touch the corner of Arizona and move on into the rolling red hills of southern Utah . This road has been in use for almost a hundred years and was known as the Mormon Trail connecting Salt Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon train known as the Sand Walking Company pioneered the route . The Sand Walking Company was originally made up of more than one hundred wagons , but greed and avarice caused the various drivers to split up and set out for themselves across country never before seen by a white man . Some of them became lost in Death Valley on Christmas Day , 1849 , and their saga is a long story of tenacity , selfishness , stupidity , courage , and death . One ironic fact stands out ? there is no record of any single person from the Sand Walking Company ever finding any gold . But they did open up southern Nevada and their mistakes made the going all the easier for those who followed . We are now in Utah 's " Dixie , " Mormon country , with all vestiges of the Spanish influence of New Mexico and Arizona replaced by bits of transplanted Middlewestern architecture of the 1850 to 1880 period . As the Virgin River twists upstream into the mountains , we find Zion National Park with its truly gorgeous scenery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more fantastic formations of Bryce Canyon National Park . From Bryce Canyon the route swings south again and drops back into Arizona and the Kaibab Plateau and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon . It is possible now to cross the Grand Canyon of the Colorado on a foot bridge or by airplane , but not by automobile . But a good road goes east from Jacob Lake ( named for Jacob Hamblin , a brave scout , pioneer , missionary , and general Indian contact man for Brigham Young ) to Marble Canyon and on south into the Navajo Indian reservation . A trip through the heart of the Indian country , making contact with U. S. 66 at Holbrook in Arizona , or Gallup in New Mexico , is not easy for city drivers but is well worth any effort . For here , beyond the Painted Desert , is the land of the Navajo and the Hopi . This is truly primitive country , touched only superficially by the white man 's world .

You may want to stop for a day because of road or weather conditions , or for ethnological reasons , or simply because you find that for the first time in your life you will be able to see a Navajo Mountain Chant or Squaw Dance or Fire Dance performed in its purest state in which you , and perhaps a local guide , may be the only white people for fifty miles around . Here , among an alien race , considered by many as backward , unsanitary , and undeveloped , you will be exposed to a philosophy of animism and beauty comparable to nothing in the Caucasian world . For the first time you may be introduced , along with trachoma and lice , to a spiritual concept cutting far deeper into human values than dollar-mark materialism .

Then on past Window Rock , the Navajo capital , and Fort Defiance , and back to the highway at Gallup , New Mexico . Here again you run head-on into modern America , for Gallup is a railroad town and in 1934 and 1935 broke into Eastern newspapers with coal , communism , labor trouble , and violence . Once a year at Gallup , late in August , a three-day Indian festival is held in which as many as twenty different tribes participate . It is an Indian show , of , by , and for Indians , and if you have missed the jaunt through the reservation and want to see Indians at home as best you can , I recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Albuquerque and encloses the great circle through the Southwest .

Eastward across New Mexico continues highway 66 , but for one last fling before we roll on into Texas , does the name Billy the Kid mean anything to you ? He was a lad born of Irish parents in New York City in 1859 . He was brought west at the age of two , killed his first man at the age of twelve , and ran the number of his victims up to twenty-one . But do n't associate this young desperado with homicidal mania . On the contrary , the Kid had many friends , was a debonair fellow , adored by American and Spanish girls alike , never killed for personal gain , had a ready smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , if the whole truth is ever told , the story will be none too pleasant and none too savory . Bits and pieces have appeared in print but none are wholly accurate . With all the lies and legends that have grown up about Billy the Kid , he is in danger of becoming the Robin Hood of the Southwest . History does n't mention him , but legendry ca n't leave him alone . One fact , however , is indisputable : at the age of twenty-one he was shot in the dark by Sheriff Pat Garrett in Pete Maxwell 's house in old Fort Sumner . And where are we now in New Mexico ? Fort Sumner . Yet , with all this coincidence , I should not recommend the drive down to the old graveyard some four miles south of the highway unless you are especially interested in checking the landmarks made famous by Billy the Kid . And in that case you will want to go to Lincoln and see the jail from which he shot his way out in a daring and spectacular break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging , and to Blazer 's Saw Mill in the Guadaloupe Mountains to see the site of the famous battle of thirteen against one , or to White Oaks , or to the Seven Rivers country , or to what was the Englishman Tunstall 's ranch , or you will want to hear the story of Billy 's only sweetheart , Abrana Garcia . Billy the Kid works magic only to those who know the significance back of the name . I happened to be in Fort Sumner a few years ago on the day that the G-men got Pretty Boy Floyd somewhere in Oklahoma , I believe . Two young chaps were drinking beer in a cafe , even as Billy himself might have done had he been present . From snatches of their conversation I could hear talk of " automatics ? pineapplestear gas ? rods . " So I broke in and said , " There used to be a boy in this town who was a pretty good shot ? Billy the Kid . " They gave me empty looks and said , " Aw yeah ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eyes shining , " Say , mister , did you hear they got Pretty Boy Floyd ? " It is the Southwest to-day . It is a country whose roots go down only as far as the consciousness of its individual inhabitants will allow ; but it has every variety of inhabitant . It is a country of Indian earth , Spanish conquistador infiltration , and American overtones ; it is a country more stunning and terrifying in natural grandeur than any other American region , and yet its superb vistas are counterpointed by the drama going on at your very feet . It is a country very old and very new , very wise and very naive , from sophisticates to cowpokes . A dude on a guest ranch is likely to walk in with the thighbone of a Hohokam , the Ancient Ones of the pre-Indian culture . Scientists may have been searching for such a trophy for ten years ; the dude may have been in Arizona only ten days ; the thighbone may have been there a hundred and ten centuries . That 's the Southwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
