 | Hero for Business Reasons Only Condensed from The New Yorker Alva Johnston In 1906 Glenn L. Martin , the 2oyear-old proprietor of a garage in Santa Ana , California , read of Orville Wright 's making a flight that lasted a minute and 4o seconds . He took out his watch and counted 100 seconds ? a long time when you are counting them . The Wrights ' first flights at Kitty Hawk three years before had not impressed him , but now he thought aviation might amount to something . l He studied the newspaper picture of an early biplane and said to his I mother , " It 's nothing but a kite with a motor in it . I 'm going to make one and fly it . " He pictured himself becoming first a pioneer in a new industry and then a great manufacturer . From that day forward , his career proceeded in a straight line . He has become one of the greatest plane builders in the world Martin was born at Macksburg , Iowa , on January 17 , 1886 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas . The classic conditions for success were all present : the boy 's family was poor , books were scarce , mass entertainment was unknown , and there was no prejudice against child labor . At the age of ten , he was doing a man 's work after school and during vacations . He can not remember when he was not interested in sails and lifting surfaces . He made an unsuccessful attempt to convert his first toy wagon into a land yacht with the help of a bed sheet . He sailed on wood-andmetal ice skates of his own make . He did some delicate navigation on his bicycle with a sail for auxiliary power . He built box kites when they were new , improved their design , and sold as many as he could make . These experiences helped give him , a decade later , the sudden conviction that he could build a flying machine . His first step was to build a glider and practice in it from the hills near Santa Ana . As soon as he felt at home in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month and in it began to construct a biplane . He did most of the work at night , and much of the time his mother held a kerosene lamp to help him . Mrs. Martin has followed every step in airplane development from that day to this , and at 78 is a thorough aeronautical expert . Martin says she is largely responsible for his career . " My mother encouraged me to believe in myself , " he said recently . " She let me make kites on the kitchen floor and never grumbled when I mussed up a room . " There were no textbooks to help Martin with his plane . He figured out the Wrights ' steering and balancing devices from scraps of information in newspapers and magazines . From a book on bridge-building he figured out where the stresses in his flying machine would come . He designed his own propeller by trial and error . IIe used a 15-horsepower Ford motor . In the final stages , he employed two mechanics . After nearly two years of work , which cost $20o0 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors were not half large enough to let the plane through . Martin said to the landlord , " When I clean up my work , how would you like to have me enlarge the church entrance and put in a vestibule ? " Assured that it would be done at Martin 's expense , the owner agreed . The inventor freed his machine by Caesarean operation ? he tore down the church front . The owner was indignant at first but was appeased when the front was rebuilt with the promised vestibule . Martin received permission from James Irvine , the largest landowner around Santa Ana , to use 16o acres four miles from the church . Fearing 1 that a daylight journey would . frighten horses , Martin moved the plane on a moonlit night . He an . three other men grasped the lower wing and trundled the craft along : . the road like a baby carriage . In August 19o9 Martin made hi first flight . The instant he felt h plane leave the ground , he brought it down . Looking back after 3 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-foot altitude gave him the greatest sensation o his life . He continued for weeks to make . low flights . He did nothing for fun or vainglory ; every hop was for the purpose of testing and studying the plane 's performance while he changed and improved his equipment . By degrees he got his plane 10 or 15 feet above the ground and maintained it there for 100 yards or so , flying at dawn or sundown . Martin learned the secrets of aerodynamics by studying the bending and twisting of the woodwork and the loosening of bolts . After each series of flights he patiently dismantled the plane , reinforced it , and tried again . He began to rise higher and make longer flights . He was repeatedly thrown out of his plane in forced landings , and he learned to take falls like an acrobat.  | His first advertised exhibition flight Was on November 21 , 1910 . The Los Angeles Times was enthusiastic about the way he " went over fences " and " flew almost to Delhi , a mile from the starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading exhibition fliers in the country . On May 1o , 19I2 , he attracted world-wide attention by flying a seaplane of his own manufacture from Newport Bay , near Los Angeles , to Catalina Island , a distance of 38 miles , and back . Instrument flying had developed to the extent that Martin flew with a compass strapped to one kg and a barometer to the other . Twenty-five years later , to the moment , Martin made another flight to Catalina ? this time in his China f Clipper , the greatest plane then in the air . " For the first time " is the standard beginning in a scrapbookful of newspaper accounts of Glenn L. Martin 's exploits in 1912 . The 26-year-old flier was the first to deliver mail , first to drop a baseball into a catcher 's mitt , first to toss a bouquet into a May Queen 's lap , first to simulate the bombing of a fort . He was the first to use a flying machine to bag coyotes , to hunt escaped convicts , to pick up a passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aviators , to take motion pictures from a plane , to shower the public from the air with department-store advertising and merchandise coupons . He appeared in numerous movies . He was starred once with Mary Pickford , not because he was a matinee idol , but because Mary was not afraid to fly with him . Martin got $700 a day for two weeks for his work with her . Martin led a double life . For money and publicity he cooperated with newspapers in a variety of stunts , which gave him a false reputation for death-defying recklessness . At the same time he was besieging bank presidents with pleas for money , on the theory that he was a man of affairs engaged in a conservative business . Capitalists hesitated . A man who took risks with his own life might take chances with another man 's capital . Just as Martin finally succeeded in lining up some extremely sensitive capital to back the expansion of his factory , he flew over Los Angeles with Valeska Suratt , famous star of vaudeville and musical comedy . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin into her leopardskin coat and kissed him explosively . The event was a national sensation . The moneyed men who had screwed up their courage to trust their capital to air pockets , engine troubles and structural defects suddenly lost their nerve at music-hall stars . This was a great injustice to Martin , a sobersided , girl-shy youth . He was stern-faced and grim-lipped ; he had thick-lensed glasses and stiff manners . His deep-black flying garb made him look like an undertaker 's assistant . Early-to-bed , early-to-rise , he never smoked or drank and lived  | largely on milk . All his life he has followed the regimen of an athlete in training . He is still a bachelor . He was a hero for business reasons only . The crackups , bruises , fractures , glamour and glory were all profit-and-loss items to Martin . He endangered his neck only when he regarded it as a justifiable business risk . When his spectacular air achievements had given solid commercial value to his name , he retired from public exhibitions and devoted himself entirely to building up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart and did put money in Martin 's plant . Afterward they became frightened that the airplane market was exhausted , so Martin bought them out and became sole owner of his business . For nearly 20 years he was compelled to battle against the ever-recurring theory that aviation had reached its peak and could expand no further . Not until 1928 did financial circles agree that flying had a future . Martin moved his factory from Santa Ana to Los Angeles in 1912 , and also started a flying school . From the beginning his planes won a reputation for ruggedness . Early in 1913 , using a home-made bombsight , he made the first real aerial bombing tests on record while an army officer studied the results from the ground . The officer complained that Martin dropped the bombs too far away from him . " I was afraid of hitting you , " said Martin . " Whenever I looked through the bombsight , I could n't see anything but you . " Martin also invented the first a tomatic parachute . Among the aerial sensations of 1913 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piloted by Marti A few months later he used parachutes for dropping a man and bicycle , and predicted that parachute troops would play an important pal ' in future wars . On August 6 , 1911 , less than a week after the start of the World War , Martin said in a news-paper interview : " The airplane will practically decide the war in Europe . Veritable flying death will smash armies , wreck mammoth battleships , , and bring the whole world to a vivid realization of the awful possibilities of a few men and a few swift aerial demons . For the oldtime war tactics are no more . The generals who realize this quickest and fight first with flying death will win . " Anticipating America 's entrance into the war , Martin began to work on designs for powerful bombers . H le formed a merger with the Wrights in 1917 , founding the Wright-Martin Aircraft Corporation . Many army and navy officers , who knew Martin 's skill as a plane builder , were eager to put him to work , but " mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile men were going to turn out planes as fast as they made cars . The Wright-Martin company was controlled by New York bankers  | who discarded the best aeronautical brains in America and placed a cement manufacturer at its head , under the hallucination that big executives could perform marvels in any field . The government refused to be bothered with the three-a-day production of Martin 's plant , wanted 2o a day . So the bankers sold the plant . A few months later several Cleveland capitalists backed Martin in a reorganized company , with a plant in Cleveland . In January 1918 , Mart plans for a new bomber received attention , for the mass production of planes by automobile experts had not been going so well . Six months alter Washington gave him his order , Vat-tin produced the first of his bombers , an unprecedented achievement . It was a twin-motor biplane carrying a bomb load of 1500 pounds , pioneer of the type which in 1921 sank a battleship , a cruiser , a destroyer and several submarines in General Billy Mitchell 's experiment off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new bomber , but by then it was too late . he war was won without the use of American-designed planes . Martin bought out his associates and looked ahead to the time when t here would be regular airplane passenger travel . His idea that the aerial age was not ending but just starting was quickly vindicated . In a few scars the demand for Martin bombers and other types was too great for his Cleveland plant and in 1929 he moved to a 126o-acre site at Middle River , near Baltimore . In 1938 Martin visited airplane factories in England and the Continent , and submitted a report to the army and navy on Nazi plane production . Officers in both services were eager to expand American air power to meet the Nazi menace , but they were up against a stone wall of governmental inertia . Congressional committeemen denounced Martin for suggesting that we needed longrange bombers . " You 're a merchant of death , " one Congressman told Martin . Later the new fashion came in of denouncing merchants of death for not making instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders running into the billions have been piled on Martin . The 14o,000-pound Mars , the world 's largest seaplane , was built by Martin , mostly at his own expense . IIe has completed designs for building a 250 , o00-pound seaplane , large enough to satisfy the most enthusiastic exponent of giant aircraft , and is ready to start on a 500,000-pounder . His output of other types has reached staggering dimensions , but the details are secret . Martin is one of the few pioneer fliers of America who are still alive . He is the only one who is today a major figure in the airplane business .
