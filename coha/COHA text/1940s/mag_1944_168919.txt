Britain mourned last week one of its best-loved comic artists . He was William Heath Robinson , England 's Rube Goldberg , whose drawings of outrageously improbable contraptions have tickled his countrymen for 30 years . Bespectacled , mustached , 72 - year- old Robinson died of heart disease at his London home . <P> Robinson 's first published cartoon was a drawing of a professor gravely examining birds ' footprints in the sand , while a fascinated bird followed the strange human track . He produced a mad catalogue of patched-together devices constructed on such engineering principles as this : " The strength of a piece of string , as of a chain , lies in its weakest part , and surely it is wisdom to cut this out and tie in a stronger piece . " In 1934 London 's Ideal Homes Exhibition included one solemn Robinson exhibit which proved a sensation : a carefully constructed , full-size Robinson house fitted with Robinson gadgets . One of them : a baby-washer made of revolving stands , one for the baby , the other carrying soap , sponge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands in opposite directions . Another convenience was a bedroom directly over a dining room so rigged that the owner could descend through the floor into a dining chair while , simultaneously , the cover over the bacon &; eggs ascended to the ceiling .
