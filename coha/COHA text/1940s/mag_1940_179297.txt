This week , in a grim , confusing world , U. S. publishers turned out some 40 new books of fiction-sizable harvest of a crop that will reach some 1,400 for the full year . <P> U. S. literature begins on courthouse steps , in general stores where men chaw , whittle and tell tales . With a fond ear for briarhopper speech the Tennessee Writers ' Project ( WPA ) gathered 25 well-chawed , well-whittled anecdotes from the Great Smokies to the levees in God Bless the Devil- ( University of North Carolina Press ; $2 ) . Their themes are lady-killing fiddlers , horse races , knife duels , preachers , hunting dogs , log-cabin adultery , possums , milk snakes , the witch of Red River who chased brave Andy Jackson back to Nashville . <P> In The Ghostland ( Lippincott ; $2.50 ) , Fred Rothermell looks in on similar folk in the Ozarks . The Fulton family of Brooklyn , N. Y. arrives in the drought country to inherit a farm about the time John Steinbeck 's Joad family ( The Grapes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less artificial than Steinbeck 's , his Ozark dialect more difficult than that of WPA 's Tennesseans . Sample : " I done lak seed a sicknun woming a widdur nur no bline gurl withouten no pappy , but shore ez youah name ez Hogner I makun yourn short a pappy , so help me Gawd ! " Young Ned Fulton recounts the impact of drought on his father , his sisters , his starving neighbors in their little grey houses . Love interest is Ned 's tenderness for Milldy , a mute Ozark urchin . After a raid on the general store , in which Pop Fulton is shot , angry Ned leads the gaunt , drought-mad farmers to the county seat for a sit-down demonstration demanding Federal relief . Upshot is a wild battle between " Red " - fearing townsfolk and desperate rustics . Dozens of both are killed when a building collapses , leaving Ned in a hospital to wonder if sister Wilhelmina will carry on , readers to wonder whether Author Rothermell 's gory climax is not too convenient an ending . <P> Another U. S. folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wait Until Spring , Bandini in Dago Red ( Viking ; $2.50 ) . It is perhaps 1940 's best book of short stories : the sort many people wish that William Saroyan , with a grip on himself at last , would write . With the emotional richness of his race and his Church , Fante writes mostly of his childhood-First Communion , baseball ambitions , parochial schools , his volatile father , long-suffering mother-always an easier trick than to write well of the adult world . But his best tale , " A Wife for Dino Rossi , " is grown-up stuff , sad , funny , brutal , tender .
