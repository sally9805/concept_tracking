The price for one bad piece of rail last week was 72 lives ( see p. 20 ) . Next year on the railroads , the highways , and in the air , the price of neglect may be higher . In a fact-packed report on transportation the Truman Committee last week bluntly warned WPB and the Services that no further miracles could be expected from the overworked , undersupplied carriers . Only a generous quantity of new equipment and replacement parts can prevent a critical transportation breakdown in 1944 . <P> The Rails . The railroad plant is wearing out faster than it is being replaced . Half the freight cars and passenger coaches are more than 20 years old , locomotives are limping along without major overhauls , roadbeds are rough and many are dangerous . Yet WPB has consistently cut down the allocation of materials the railroads have set as their minimum needs . Thus the rails ' plea for 2.1 million tons of new rail in 1943 was slashed to 1.5 . Result : derailments are dangerously frequent . Anticipating the 15% increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 80,000 new freight cars , finally got less than 28,000 . Total expenditures for maintenance this year will be $200 million less than the railroads wanted to spend . <P> The Truman Committee reasons that there is little sense in producing war materials next year if the railroads are unable to deliver the output . <P> The Highway . Even more illogical to the Committee is the vast horde of trucks held by the War Department , while the 4,500,000 civilian trucks are rapidly falling apart . This year civilian truckers got only 54,000 new trucks , about one-tenth their 1941 truck replacements , and only 31,000 vehicles are left in the reserve pool . <P> After much prodding , the Committee got word that in 1943-44 the War Department will procure for its own use and that of the British and Russian forces , 1.4 million new trucks . The report , tactfully but to the point , suggested that nearly a million and a half trucks , added to " the very substantial numbers " now in possession of the armed forces and the Allies , was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned the War Department to " maintain an accurate and up-to-date inventory " of its trucks , with an eye on how many ton-miles of use they are getting . ( This resulted from stories of vast stores of unused trucks . ) <P> But trucks are only part of the trouble . Tires are a critical shortage . The Committee found that , despite glowing reports on synthetic rubber production , there will be a deficiency of about three million truck tires in 1944 , and that heavy-duty tires made 70% of synthetic rubber will not stand up in service . To the tire industry the report said sourly : " The Committee is disappointed that the synthetic rubber tire manufacturing program has proceeded so far without solving the problem of making satisfactory heavy-duty tires for trucks and busses.
