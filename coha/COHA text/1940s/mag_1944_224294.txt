Iceland 's thousand-year-old Althing ( Parliament ) last week carried out the mandate of Icelanders ( TIME , May 15 ) . Every bell in the island pealed as Althing members assembled in the open air on Thingvellir ( Parliament Plains ) , passed a law declaring Iceland an independent republic , voted to make Lawyer Sveinn Bjornsson the first president . Since U.S. troops landed in Iceland in 1941 he had served as Regent for Denmark 's King Christian X , whose objections to an independent republic were overruled by the Althing.
