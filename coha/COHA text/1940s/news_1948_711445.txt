txt A formal inter-service committee of the national military establishment recommended today , after nine months deliberation , that the National Guard be brought under Federal control , but James Forrestal , Secretary of Defense , declined to support this or any part of his committee 's proposed legislative program . Contents a the ambitious 200-page report by the Committee on Civilian Components , the so-called " Gray Board , " were discussed in a news conference yesterday . At the same conference , Mr. Forrestal declared that he did not regard the report , containing ninety recommendations for reorganization of the ' reserves of the armed forces , as " a pattern for legislative action by myself . " In a prepared disclaimer , the Secretary praised the work of the committee as " oite of the most thorough and constructive jobs , in the field of national security , that has taken place in a number of years . " He continued , however , that the report " does not , at this stage , constitute military establishment policy , since it has not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their staffs . " Report Gets Unanimous Support The report represented the unanimous opinions of the six-man , all - services committee , whose chairman was Gordon Gray , Assistant Secretary of the Army . Other members were John Nicholas Brown , Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air ; Cornelius V. Whitney , Assistant Secretary of the Air Force ; Lieut . Gen. Raymond S. , of the United States Army ; Vice-Admiral William M. Fechteler , and Brig . Gen. John P. McConnell , of the United States Force . Named last November by Secretary Forrestal , the committee held si -- ty-five meetings , heard eightynine witnesses , and received cornmen1 from almost 200 organizations interested in or representing some branch of the reserve forces . The group proposed in its first recommendation that each service  --  the Army , Navy and Air Force ? have a single Federal reserve force , in which the organized reserves of the Army and the National Guard would be combined as the " National Guard of the United States . " The new National Guard would be integrated completely with the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " exclusive Federal jurisdiction . " The committee stated that it had arrived at the National Guard recommendation " only after the most careful consideration . " " It recognized , on the other hand , " continued the report , " the needs of the states for effective forces permanentlY under their control and quickly available for ldcal use , and on the other hand the need of the Federal . Government for trained reinforcements for its limited regular forces . It recognized that the National Guard has been assigned both functions  --  a state mission and a Federal mission , which might have to be executed simultaneously under the most dangerous circumstances . Other ' Units Proposed " The committee applied its yardstick of national . security and agreed unanimously that the National Guard should remain a part of the country 's striking force and that other units should be organized under state control to meet important local demands of war in the atomic age and the techniques of the fifth column . " It is this leading recommendation , according to well-informed observers , that provoked Secretary Forrestal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to run strong and critical , the Secretary as suddenly returned the report for preliminary readings and announced that it would be made public on schedule - today . In his statement yesterday , Mr. Forrestal explained that , before his reading of a press release ac-. companying the report , he thought it " might be desirable to refer to the report back to the board " for clarification of the fact that it does not constitute/national policy . The presb release , he said , seemed to make this clear . The recommendation for Federalizing the National Guard is supported legally by the committee by reference to the " Army Clause " of the Constitution  --  Article I , Section 8 , Clause 12 . This clause states that " the Congress shall have power * * * to raise and support armies * * * . " The power to raise armies , according to United States vs . Macintosh , 283 U. S. 605 , 622 ( 1931 ) , " necessarily connotes the like power to say who shall serve in them and in what way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized by the states under the " militia clause " of the Constitution . Article I , Section 8 , Clause 16 states that " Congress shall have power ... to provide for organizing , arming and disciplining , the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , reserving to the states respectively , the appointment of the officers , and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline described by Congress . " It is anticipated that the state governors , who now hold control over the National Guard under this clause , may question the constitutionality of the committee 's recommendation , should it ever be proposed to Congress by the national military establishment . War of 1812 Is Cited The War of 1812 , according to the Gray Board , demonstrated the " utter inadequacy " of the mili-. tia role of the National Guard in a national emergency . The board said it was convinced that the same forces can not be expected to " perform both local and national functions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequately under state control . " Federalization of the Guard , continued the board , would eliminate two obstacles to swift mobilization ? " the legal anchronism which makes the National Guard unavailable for its Federal mission until Congress formally declares a state of emergency and the timeconsuming retransfer of property and equipment from the states to the Federal government when the National Guard is mobilized . " The committee also argued that the present form and force of the National Guard " with its present powerful armament " does not make it suitable even for the state missions in case of riot or civil uprisings . It stated : " To pose a threat of artillery , armor or air power against citizens of this country is hardly in keeping with any foreseeable situation , and not consistent with sound public policy . " The Guard as now armed , the report continued , should not normally be used in strike duty or " other minor civil disturbances . " ' This should be the responibility , ! said the group , of local police officers with experience in handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Guardsman . Accompanying the National Guard recommendation were eighty-nine additional proposals , all believed somewhat less inflammatory than the first , but controversial to a degree , nevertheless . The committee recommended specifically , for example , that reserve officers while on active duty should be members of the regular service . While this may bring a protest froth some of the regular service officers , especially the West Point and Annapolis graduates , Mr. Gray said yesterday that he believed the antagonism between the reserve and regular officers was comparable to the reports of Mark Twain 's death ? " grossly exaggerated . " Modern warfare , the committee warned , demands that the forces be ready for immediate action ana swift deployment overseas " to keep war away from our own territory and ready for prompt use at home if an enemy should penetrate our defenses by force or by stealth . " The force should be limited , however , continued the group , to a comparatively small regular establishment , ' augmented ? by trained civilians in the " American tradition .
