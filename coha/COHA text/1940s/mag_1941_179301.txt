OPM and the Army were scrapping about ordnance ; the Army and Lend-Lease were at loggerheads over which should get the produced planes , tanks , guns , etc . OPM and the Office of Civilian Defense were at odds ; the State Department wrestled with the new Office of Economic Defense ; OPM 's priorities section skirmished steadily with Federal agencies which wanted priorities . <P> The entire OPM v. OPACS fight over how-much and in-what-way the production of automobiles should be cut down became futile this week when the shortage of copper became so acute that there would be none left for non-defense consumption ( see p. 61.
