Gilbert Adrian , who was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 's head dressmaker for 15 years and now has become simply Adrian , opened his divine new pink and blue couturier 's salon in Beverly Hills last week at about the time that fighting men of the United Nations were raiding Dieppe . <P> In the elegant programs given his patrons he had inserted a card bearing his wartime views : " We feel privileged at this vital time in our world 's history to present a collection of clothes carefully attuned to Government Order L-85 . Here , briefly , are the highlights of this Government ruling : No bias or dolman sleeves . No woolen evening wraps . No woolen evening dresses . A maximum of 144-inch sweep for evening dresses . No suit jacket over 25 inches long . No cuffs on suits . No patch pockets . No belt over two inches wide . No overskirts . " <P> Where 's the U.S.O. ? The show was a great success . Lady Mendl brought her Pekingese . Barbara Hutton Mdivani Haugwitz-Reventlow Leach ( Mrs. Cary Grant ) ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan Fontaine , Carole Landis clapped delighted hands with the lesser Hollywood lights and the wealthy housewives from Beverly Hills and Pasadena as Adrian , himself costumed in a two-piece creation of flannel with cuffed trousers and a washable blue tie , displayed his confections . <P> One creation named " Trim Little Suit " brought ecstatic applause as the models began parading across the pink carpet , posturing on a raised dais . Adrian 's price : $225 . Another , " It 's Not True " ( $210 ) had a long black skirt and a transparent lace front . " Black Glamour " ( $395 ) was a study in black seductiveness for evening . Adrian showed 60 of his creations : " Suit with Red Excitement , " " Black Dress with Two Roses , " " Dinner with a Dash of Gold , " " Commando , " " For a Visit to the Camp , " " When He 's Home , " " Peace and Quiet , " " Where 's the U.S.O. ? " <P> Dream . Year ago Adrian decided it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved a lot of money and he married ex-Star Janet Gaynor ( who people say is worth $4,000,000 ) . He would have the most beautiful custom salon in the country . By September he had signed a ten-year lease for the Victor Hugo , once a fine restaurant , * then fancy nightclub , and planned expensive alterations . But when war came , his expenses , for a temporary shop on Beverly Drive , a factory in downtown Los Angeles , and Press Agent Russell Birdwell , were about $3,500 a week . In January Adrian 's feet grew cold : he said he just did n't know what to do . Maybe he would chuck the whole business . He was despondent . <P> But his landlord held him to his lease by telling him a story : Two little frogs fell into a churn full of cream . One swam around , got tired and decided he might as well drown . The other kept on swimming until he felt an island forming under him - an island of butter formed by his paddling . " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the little frog that gave up easily or will you be the one to keep on paddling and finally win out ? " Adrian thought he would paddle .
