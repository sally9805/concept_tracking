For six months Hearst 's Chicago Herald-American had dawdled along in a well-worn rut . Next to Bertie McCormick 's Tribune , it had the biggest circulation in town and was holding it . But the Herald 's news coverage had gone dull after the whoopdedoo of the Heirens murder case . Sex crimes got big headlines now &; again , but the news lacked the red-and-saffron splashes of rich detail that had won the Herald its readers . <P> The lapse did not escape the eye of William Randolph Hearst , who seldom waits for a paper to get into trouble before jacking it up . A fortnight ago , in the wake of the merger of the tabloid Chicago Times with Marshall Field 's Sun ( TIME , Aug. 4 ) , a shakeup hit the Herald 's top brass . Chicago-trained , cigar-chomping George Ashley De Witt came on from Washington as executive editor-the job once held by loud Lou Ruppel , who got in bad with the Chief by branding Chicago " Dirty Shirt Town . " Drawling Lou Shainmark came back from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A squad of other executives was reshuffled . <P> To mastermind the change of command , an old soldier of fortune who had fought through Chicago 's rowdiest journalistic wars slipped into town . Ruddy , trumpet-voiced Walter Howey , prototype of the managing editor in The Front Page , had temporarily dropped his regular chores ( supervising Hearst 's two Boston tabloids with one hand and the American Weekly with the other ) to help raise the steam pressure in the Herald-American 's boilers . <P> Howey would say not a word about what was afoot at the Herald . " Just watch the paper , that 's all , " said Shainmark . Last week it was worth watching once more ; the front page looked like the result of an explosion in a type foundry . <P> <P> SUPPORT OUR MAYOR KEN.NELLY ! cried an eight-column 120-point red banner - line ( the kind dear to Hearst 's heart ) . <P> <P> CAPONE MOB COMING BACK , shouted the black streamer below it . The kind of newsbreak that Howey &; Co. knew how to play to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four former henchmen of Al Capone had been paroled from prison , and the Herald was sure that they - and maybe even gunplay-were due in Chicago any minute . Across the page from that story , the Herald told all about " two good policemen who are on trial for trying to solve a murder . " This kind of news , said a front-page editorial , was run " to help Mayor Kennelly prevent the return of gangster rule in this city . " Capone 's mob might or might not be coming back , but there was no doubt that an able mob of Hearstlings had moved in on the Her old-American.
