TIME Correspondent James Aldridge last week cabled this dispatch from the Soviet-Iranian Border . <P> Along these terrible roads Red Army units are moving toward one of the many battlefronts . They have all been in battle before . Now they are returning after resting up . There is cavalry among them , and it is the first cavalry I have seen in this war . <P> Cavalry is the Russian winter weapon . Some of these horsemen were operating with General Melnik the whole of . last winter some five hundred miles behind the German lines . One of the officers told me they were pretty lean when they came out , but now they are square-looking again , their horses are fresh and they can sing . <P> They were singing a Ukrainian song which has no name . They leaned forward to counteract the steep trail , their long swords jangling against their stirrups , their bodies creaking on leather . <P> The mountain roads are a panorama of up-moving and down-moving transport . Here the Russians have utilized everything to get stuff up : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valleys . Mules in stupid groups mingle on the road , slowing up U.S.-made trucks ably driven by Red Army drivers . The strange smell of Russian petrol is mixed with horse , mule and camel manure and the natural pleasantness of the hills . <P> Everybody is waiting for the first signs of winter . Up here it is goddamn cold and the wind rips down from the Black and Caspian Seas . Sometimes black clouds scud over the Caucasus . But when the wind ceases and clouds lie tranquil , then comes snow and thick rain and real cold . That is what all these men are waiting for . That , after the second front , is what the whole Soviet Union is waiting for . <P> If Stalingrad falls , most of the German weight will be directed against the Caucasus . There are five ways through the Caucasus : one route on the Caspian Sea , one on the Black Sea , three passes across terrible mountains . They all come out into the southern Caucasus valley , stretching from Batum to Baku . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive will be directed on Baku . <P> Should the Caucasus battle develop this winter , it is likely to be a personal-leader struggle between German General Siegmund List and Russian General Melnik . Melnik conducted the guerrilla offensive all last winter behind the German lines . He is more of a flat-terrain soldier than a mountaineer , but the essentials of the battle for the Caucasus will be fought in the approaches and . because the Germans will not be able to move much in winter , this tough Soviet Cossack will probably harass the Germans more than the actual battle will . <P> The Red Army is more serious about the war than any other army I have met . They are soldiers first and last . Their discipline is the best I have seen in any army , but with an essential and common-sense approach . On duty they are formal with officers . Off duty , officers and men mix more than in any army I have seen . <P> Myths about the inefficiency of Soviet transport are dispelled by the tremendous movements going on here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less paper work and red tape than in most armies . There is also more of a chance for men to make suggestions . In Tabriz I interviewed 30-year-old Colonel Boris Ruhjov . He did not have a paper on his desk , only a field telephone and a map . He had no gestures , no habits to exhibit .
