The three teen-agers were tougher than anyone their age ought to be . One was a gunman , one a thief , one an incorrigible delinquent . All of them had made several escapes from Missouri 's ill-famed Training School for Boys at Boonville and been recaptured . But they were not tough enough to take the n agging boredom of the bleak , brick-tiled isolation cell . Irritable and depressed , they yammered at each other . <P> Ironically , the argument touched a question of tough professional pride . How old did you have to be to get into the Algoa Reformatory near Jefferson City , a place for even tougher guys ? As the words grew angrier , one of the boys grabbed Rolland Barton , 15 , from behind , crooked one arm around his neck and held on for ten minutes . When the body grew limp , he and the third boy tossed it on the bunk , tore strips from a blanket and cinched them around their victim 's neck to finish the job . In a final fury they showered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rolland Barton was dead . <P> It was the second such killing in five months at Boonville and it stung indignant Missourians to action . A state senator demanded an investigation ; Boonville 's residents held a mass meeting . <P> Superintendent John C. Tindall , who had taken over after the first killing , made no excuses . He had done his best to clean up the filth , weed out the crooked , underpaid staffers , refurbish inadequate and worn-out equipment . But he could do no more in the face of apathetic , economy-minded state legislators . Said Tindall bitterly : " More criminals have been made in this institution in the past 30 years than in any institution in the United States . "
