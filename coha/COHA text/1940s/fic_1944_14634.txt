A high place along the Wabash . A young Negro in a convict 's uniform comes along , just before daybreak . A hobo , unseen by the boy , sleeps nearby . JOE softlyThank God for the big moon , or I 'd never find it . ( He embraces the three , then looks at heart-arrow-and-initials carved into the trunk of the tree : ) J. B. ( Pause ) L. O.

Back at our tree , back where we stashed my old clothes .

Grab a freight to El Paso , get myself home to Mexico , a place I never seen before . I 'll get word to you where I am , and then you 've got to find out how to stop fighting ' em , so they 'll say you 're not crazy , and let you go . I 'll get money to you , too , and then you take a train and ride to Mexico . Bring our little boy , born out of wedlock , so I can hold him in my arms and be his papa .

Come on down to Mexico , and we 'll pick up where we left off , where we were so rudely interrupted . Said I robbed a gas station , the man himself pointed his finger and said I was the one . I robbed nobody , never robbed anybody in my whole life . Said that because we walked down the street together , right in front of everybody . And that 's a crime . That 's a crime they do n't have a name for , even . So they gave it the name of robbing a gas station  --  for me . And for you  --  they gave it the name of insanity . Goodbye , my country .

Nothing in the hole but last year 's old leaves , but do n't get excited . Always try to think . First , is this the tree ? ( Looks at the heart and initials again . ) Yes , this is the tree . I remember carving that heart and those initials . O.K. , fish in there , and this time bring out the package . ( He fishes into the hole of the tree three times , bringing up a few leaves the first time , and nothing but dirt and dust the second and third times . ) Who took the package I stashed ? Who played a dirty trick like that on Joe Blake ? The hobo mumbles in his sleep , and turns over , his face to Joe . Joe hides behind the tree , waits , and after a moment goes to the Hobo and stands over him . p. 3 JOE I 'd know those clothes anywhere . Now , how did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice . ) I do n't want to scare an old man , but you 've got on my clothes . HOBO ( Sits up , terrified ) What ? What is this ? What 's the matter ? What do you want ? JOE All right , now , I 'm not going to hurt you , but you 've got on my clothes . And I 've got to have ' em . HOBO Clothes ? What clothes ? JOE Look inside that coat . You 'll see a label in there says Loeb 's . I bought that suit at Loeb 's right here in Lafayette away back in 1957 , wore it every day for three whole years , wrapped it up in old newspapers and put the package in that tree a year ago . You 're wearing my clothes . How 'd you fin ' em ? How 'd you ever get the idea of poking around in that tree ? HOBO I bought these clothes in Cincinnati . I can prove it . I 've got the bill of sale . Best clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JOE Do n't make conversation with me , old man , just get out of my clothes and get back into your own . Get up now , on your feet , and out of my clothes . HOBO ( Remains lying down ) Well , you know , I can be a good friend to a young fellow in trouble . A little consideration for an old man is all I ask . Now , what 's going on , son ? p. 4 JOE Get up on your feet when you talk double talk to me HOBO I 've got a bad back , a bad leg , rheumatism all over , and I 'm not well , son . I ca n't get up on my feet . JOE All right , let me have your old clothes , then . I do n't want to be around a rotten old man like you . A dirty liar I 'll take your dirty old clothes , and get away from here as fast as I can go . Where are they ? HOBO I 'm wearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOE How 'd you find ' em ? That 's the part I ca n't understand . HOBO Bought ' em . Bought ' em in Cincinnati . Away back in 1957 . Best clothes I ever bought . Had a job at the time . Night watchman out at this great big warehouse . JOE Where 's your old clothes ? HOBO The clothes I had before I bought this suit I gave to an old friend . I want to help you . I 'm not the kind of man not to try to help a friend in need . JOE Get up on your feet , old man . I 'm ashamed to talk to a liar who 's lying down . HOBO There 's a lot of ways I can help a fellow in your fix . JOE The only way you can help me is to give me my clothe p. 5 HOBO No , son . By keeping my mouth shut , too . I 'm good at that . " I never saw anybody . No , sir , I never saw any young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regular clothes . I was up there sleeping under the trees , but I never saw anybody . I can do that for you , son . They wo n't bother me too much . I 'll just tell ' em , the way I know how . " No , sir , I did n't see anybody . If you 're looking for somebody , I did n't see him . I do n't know who you 're looking for . " That 's just one of the ways I can help you , son . JOE Christ , when is my bad luck going to stop ? HOBO Right now , son . JOE You 're a liar . HOBO Oh , I ai n't saying I ai n't . I 'll lie to cops any day . I hate cops . We 're on the same side , son . I 've done time , too . I know what it is to be on the run . I 've been hunted , too . One time with dogs . I 'm afraid of dogs . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're hunting a man makes me sick to my stomach , because I 've been hunted down and caught by dogs . Dogs and men both . I ai n't saying I ai n't a liar , but I like to pick and choose who I lie to , and I do n't lie to anybody on my side . JOE I 'm not on anybody 's side . HOBO What 'd you do , boy ? Who 'd you kill ? p. 6 JOE I told you I do n't want you to lie there and make crazy conversation . I 've got to move along . I 've got to have my clothes to move along in . I do n't want to hurt you , and I do n't want you to make me hurt you . I 've got to have my clothes . HOBO You 've made a mistake , son . These are my clothes . You 're wearing your clothes . Let me help you . Stay along the river . You 'll soon come to the shack of somebody who ai n't home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the clothes you need . The cops come along , poking around for information , mum 's the word . " No , sir . I never saw anybody . " Who 'd you kill ? JOE You stop that talk about killing , old man . HOBO I told you , I 've done time . I know a killer when I see one . Killers are always the kind you 'd never believe would ever kill . They 're the aristocracy of the penitentiaries . They 're the only ones who are decent . They 're sensitive , and superior . You 're a killer , son . You 're a decent man . JOE Tell me where your old clothes are , I 'll put them on , burn these , and say so long , good luck to you . Where are they ? HOBO You 're really too decent to keep telling me I 'm a liar , son . It is n't right , you know . If there 's a price on your head , do you think that means anything to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 7 JOE Let 's get one thing straight . ( He flips open the Hobo 's jacket , and holds it open . ) Loeb 's . Right there . See that ? There is no Loeb 's in Cincinnati , old man . ( He stands . ) Now . Where 's your old clothes ? HOBO That store in Cincinnati sold me this suit , son . I did n't bother about the label . JOE What did you do with your old clothes ? It 's getting daybreak and I 've got to move along . Where are they ? HOBO It 's like I said , I 'd like to help you any way I can , any possible way I can . JOE What do you do , go along the river and poke into trees ? Is that what you do ? HOBO I do n't go along the river at all , except a little in the summertime . I stick pretty close to streets . Any time I pass a telephone booth and nobody 's around , I fish into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of nickels and dimes I pick up that way . Once in a while a quarter , too . But trees are another matter entirely . I can help you . JOE I 've got a couple of dollars . Two silver dollars . HOBO Two ? What could an old man with a bad back and a bad leg and rheumatism all over do with two dollars ? p. 8 JOE It 's all I 've got . Give me your old clothes and you can have the two dollars . HOBO Twenty-two dollars might be something to think about . For that kind of money I could get up and go on into town and buy you a second-hand pair of pants somewhere , and some kind of coat . You do n't want anything fancy . And maybe I 'd throw in an old hat if you thought an old hat might help you make your getaway , and that would just about use up the whole twenty-two dollars . But I 'd be glad to have helped a fellow man in trouble , and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bottle of muscatel . Twenty-two dollars might be something . Oh , the silver you have is two dollars , I 'm sure of that . But in your shoe I think you 'll find you slipped a double-sawbuck and then forget all about it . For all I know maybe there 's another double-sawbuck in your other shoe , but that 's your business . JOE I have n't got time for you to go to town and buy some old clothes . I ca n't wait . HOBO You 've got to wait , son . It 's your best chance . I 'll bring you a loaf of bread , a pound of cheese , and a bottle of milk , too . Eat your fill , lie down somewhere out of the way , and rest . Sleep through the whole day , and then as soon as it 's dark just move on down the river , down the old Wabash to where it runs into the Mississippi , and then take your chances on grabbing a freight . Do n't try hitching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 9 JOE I ca n't wait . I 'm afraid to wait . HOBO No need to be afraid , son . I 'm on your side . I hate cops . I hate the law . The law is stupid , always has been . It 's not for the likes of you and me . It 's for the others . The likes of us have got to fight our way through the best we know how . Twenty-two dollars and just rest right here where I 've been resting . Nobody comes along here . If they do , just run down that hill over there , you 'll find plenty of cover . If you 're not right here when I come back , I 'll find you . Do n't be afraid of me , son . I 'm your friend . JOE Just let me have your old clothes , and you can have the whole twenty-two dollars , then . HOBO Son , that remark hurt me . That hurt me badly . I do n't want life-and-death money . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your way , with half a chance to get there . JOE Where 'd you put your old clothes ? HOBO Now , would n't I tell you if there were old clothes ? Of course I would . But there are n't any old clothes , son . You 've got to understand that . As an illustration of what I mean , when these clothes I 'm wearing , that I bought in Cincinnati in 1957 , when they ca n't be worn another day , and when I 've got new clothes to wear , what would I do with these clothes ? I 'd burn them , would n't I ? ( Joe notices the ashes and charred cinders of a fire . He pokes among them . ) I made a little fire for a couple of hot dogs I brought up here for supper last night . p. 10 JOE I wish you had n't burned your old clothes . HOBO You 're a decend lad , son , and you ought to try not to hurt an old man with remarks like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to help yourself first , do n't you ? HOBO No , son . JOE How you ever happened to find my old suit in that tree in the first place is something I 'll never be able to understand . HOBO I did no such thing , son . JOE Just another example of my crazy bad luck , that 's all . HOBO I 'm good luck , son . Everybody I know says I 'm good luck . JOE Could n't you have gotten here tonight instead of last night ? HOBO I 'm at your service , son . Ready , willing , and waiting . JOE Right now I 'd be in my old suit and on my way , instead of this . HOBO This is your best chance . Just give me the money and forget everything . JOE Right now nobody would know . In a week I 'd be in Juarez , across the Rio . HOBO Juarez it is , son . Juarez , in old Mexico . p. 11 JOE So here I am talking to a crooked old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOBO You 'll be in Juarez before you know it . JOE An old man I have n't got the heart to shut up , even . And I 'll tell you why , too . I feel sorry for him . I feel sorrier for him then for anybody else in this whole world . I ought to knock him cold and take my clothes and go , but I ca n't . I guess I never was cut out to be a success . If I happened to hit him too hard , and he happened to die , nobody would know who was dead , nobody would miss him , but I would know , old man . You 'd be dead and nobody would know who it was , even . HOBO I 've got a sister in Denver , lives up on a hill . Married rich , knows all about me . You 'd never get away with it . You 'd be tracked down . JOE How much do you want , to let me have my suit , and let me go ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you have my suit for any amount , son . It 's the only suit I have . Money is n't everything . I 'm offering to help you . Offering . There 's nothing in it for me . I 've got to walk into town , buy the stuff , walk back here  --  alone . Alone , mind you , son . I 've got to see you safely on your way , and then for all that trouble how much will I have for myself ? A dollar maybe , or at the most two . Is that asking too much ? Now , you know it is n't , son . p. 12 JOE The more you talk the further away Juarez gets . HOBO Here 's your plan , all worked out . Let me have the money . Lay low . I 'll go fetch the things you need . I 'll come back . You change your clothes . Eat , Drink . Go down that path and forget you ever saw me . And I 'll forget I ever saw you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liar . Everything you say is a lie . You 've been a liar all your life . You do n't mean what you say , and so far I ca n't even guess what you really mean . When I found nothing in the tree , I should have run . I never should have let you see me . Somewhere in every man 's life somebody is waiting . And he 'll be there in the end to spoil everything . Spoil every minute gone by , and every minute ahead . And a man wo n't be able to do anything about it , either . He wo n't be able to do anything I could pick you up and bash you against that tree and be on my way . HOBO Of course you could , son . Do n't you think I know that ? JOE But I wo n't do it . I 'll be damned if I 'll do it . Nothing  --  I said nothing , old man  --  is ever going to make me  --  Joe Blake , that 's my name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Bad luck Joe Blake  --  nothing is ever going to make me do the thing that is for me alone , and for nobody else . The thing that 's against somebody else , even you , old man , I wo n't be . I came along this way to live , not to stop somebody else from living , and especially not to stop you , a rat of an old man . Somebody else can do it if he wants to , but not me . You can do it to somebody else , even . I came along this way with my bad luck stamped all over me  --  black . Now , let 's see you live , boy . Let 's see you live black . Well , you 're not black , old man . You had your chance , and look at you . p. 13 HOBO My sister up on that hill in Denver , rich , she remembers me . JOE Yes , yes , and your mother loved you , too . And all it ever came to is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody else would hate you for an insult like that , son , but do n't you think I know you 're not yourself just now ? You 're not yourself . I do n't hate you . I want to be good luck to you . Do you want to believe that I want to be good luck to you ? Do you want to try to believe ? JOE Yes , you dirty stinking rat of an old man . Yes , I want to believe . I want to believe in the whole dirty rat of a human race , do n't I ? If I could believe you want to help me , I 'd almost bewilling to go back , turn myself over , and do my time . But how can I believe ? Can you believe anything your dirty mouth can say ? How do you expect me to believe what you ca n't believe ? HOBO You 've got to believe me , son . I give you my word , I swear on my mother , on my sister in Denver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to go fetch you the things you need to get to where you want to go . May I drop dead if that is n't the truth . JOE But you wo n't give me my clothes . It 's either kill you and take them  --  my own clothes  --  or take a chance , take another chance on a dirty crooked human being , take another chance on the miserable desperate human race . You wo n't give me my clothes ? p. 14 HOBO How can I give you the only clothes I have in the world ? Answer me that ? I ca n't put on your clothes and go back into town , can I ? Fair 's fair , and you 've got to face facts , son . I 've got to go fetch , I 've got to go buy with money  --  and I have n't got any money of my own , or I would have slept in a bed last night , would n't I ? I 've got to go fetch the things you need . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when I was a kid , teased and pushed around and laughed at and made a fool of . I want to prove something to myself , I guess you might say . If you ca n't believe me , then turn around and run away . I 'll go back to sleep . I need a lot of sleep . I 'll forget I ever saw you . Two or three miles down the river , you 'll find a shack with nobody home , and you 'll find your getaway clothes , too . Believe me , son . Do me a favor . Believe me , or go away and let me forget I ever saw you . I do n't want anything from anybody . Believe me , or turn around and run away . I saw nobody . I did n't even wake up . I slept here all night . JOE How long will you be gone ? HOBO I 'll come back as soon as I 've got the stuff . Do you believe me ? JOE I believe you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do believe you . HOBO I want to do this . I want to do this more than anything in the world . More than anything I have ever wanted to do . p. 15 JOE Twenty-two dollars ? HOBO Not for me , son . I wo n't be going to town for myself , I 'll be going for you . Twenty-two dollars . JOE Are you sure that will be enough ? HOBO Yes , I think twenty-two will cover everything . JOE And it wo n't make any difference where I get the money from ? HOBO Of course not  --  but hold on , son . I do n't think I get the drift of what you 're saying . You 'd get the money out of your shoe , would n't you ? JOE Just answer my question , old man . HOBO I 'd like to answer your question , son , but I do n't see how I can until I get the drift of what you 're talking about . JOE Just answer the question , God damn you . HOBO But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help you , but you 've got to let me in on what you 're talking about . You 're going to get the money out of your shoe , ai n't you ? You 're not going to get it out of my shoe , are you , because I have n't got any money in my shoe . JOE Stand up . HOBO I ca n't stand up , son . I 'm sick , the way I 'd be if I heard hound dogs bugling. p. 16 JOE ( Seizes him and lifts him to his feet . The Hobo stays limp . ) You ai n't sick . You 're crooked . ( Drops him . ) Drop down and die , then . HOBO Oh , now , son , you keep hurting me . Give me the drift of what you 're trying to say and I 'll try to help you . JOE I 'll go back . I 'll go back and do my time , plus extra time for breaking away . That 's easier than this . HOBO No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help you . JOE Listen to me , you dirty rat of an old man . L. O. herself , my girl , Laura Olmeida , a Portuguese girl , the girl I was going to marry before they framed me  --  L. O. herself , sewed three double-sawbucks , sixty dollars , into the lining of that coat . ( Quickly reaches down , rips some lining loose , tears the lining open , brings out three twenty-dollar bills . ) Now , did you buy that suit in Cincinnati ? If I give you this twenty-dollar bill and these two silver dollars , will you go into Lafayette and fetch me the things I need ? HOBO ( Almost to himself , amazed ) Sixty dollars in the lining . JOE Yes , sixty dollars , so tell me again you bought the suit in Cincinnati . Tell me again to believe you . Tell me to give you the sixty dollars because it 's your suit and so it 's got to be your money , too . Tell me that . p. 17 HOBO Sixty dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man gets old , he forgets , son . I was in Denver just last year and I went out to my sister 's house early one afternoon when I knew her husband would be at the office , and my sister  --  JOE For the love of God , old man , shut up , will you ? Just shut up . HOBO I swear on my mother , son  --  it 's the truth . I just happened to forget it , that 's all . My sister sewed that money in my suit . That money 's my money , son , and I know you would n't want JOE How can you do it ? How did it happen ? Do you believe what you 're saying ? Can you actually believe one dirty lie after another ? HOBO I 'm not saying you do n't need some money , too . All I 'm saying is , What good is sixty dollars as long as you 're in those clothes ? We 're on the same side , and I want to help you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing in your shoe , just the two silver dollars , and you 've robbed me of the sixty dollars my sister sewed in my suit , then it 's up to me to help you with some of my own money . Give me the sixty and I 'll go to town and buy you everything you need , and come back , and you can keep the two silver dollars . JOE You 'll bring me nothing , that 's what you 'll bring me. p. 18 HOBO I can help you . Nobody else in this whole world can help you , except me . It 's almost as if I were your own father . Would n't a father want to help his own son ? Give me the sixty , son , and I 'll go fetch the things you need . JOE Goodbye , old man . I 'm running away . I ca n't take another minute of you . ( He turns and runs . ) HOBO ( Shouts ) They 'll catch you , boy . I 'll have to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's clothes . It 's my duty as a citizen . It 's my duty to my sister , too . She did that for me . She wanted me to have that money when I 'd need it most . Come back now and let 's talk business . JOE ( Coming back . ) I ought to lift you up and bash your head against that tree . Here 's twenty dollars . Just do n't stool on me , that 's all . Go get yourself forty bottles of muscate ! Take my clothes and twenty dollars of my money  --  for nothing . HOBO Twenty dollars ai n't enough , son . You know twenty dollars ai n't enough . Freedom so cheaply bought ca n't be freedom at all , can it , son ? JOE I think you 're asking me to knock you cold . Is that what you 're asking me to do ? HOBO I do n't tell other people how to live their lives , but knocking me cold would be just about the worst thing you could do , son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail for doing a thing like that , or maybe worse . You know that . I do n't have to tell you . You 'd never see Juarez , you 'd never see L. O. again . I 'm old , anyway . I 've had the best of it . You might be doing me a favor , even , putting me out of my misery . Rheutatism is no fun , son . And loss of memory is no fun , either . And being robbed is no fun . But do what you like . I was lying here fast asleep when you came along . You woke me up , insulted me , hurt my feelings , robbed me of the few dollars I have in the whole world , and now you want to kill me . Well , go ahead . I was afraid to live , but I ai n't afraid to die . I always knew you were a killer . I 'm ready any time you are . p. 19 JOE How much do you want , then ? HOBO I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what do I get for it ? HOBO Like I said . A pair of pants , a coat , maybe a hat , bread , cheese , milk . And mum 's the word . Out of the kindness of my heart . Because we 're on the same side . Outcasts . Failures . Rebels . And good luck to you , the best of luck to you the rest of your life . ( Joe throws the money at the Hobo , who gathers it together without getting to his feet . ) You keep hurting me , son . That was n't nice , the way you handed me my money . You threw it at me . But that 's all right . I understand . I make allowances . ( Joe goes to the tree and puts his arms around it . The Hobo reaches behind him , behind a rock , and brings out a tatterred old coat , fishes into the pocket , brings out a revolver . ) I 'm your friend , son , and I 'm trying to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in old Mexico . I 've got my own clothes , and I 've got my sister in Denver to see that I do n't suffer too much . Now , you just go right on trusting me , because it 's right to trust me , it 's right to trust your fellow man , it 's right to believe in the human race , white , black , red , or yellow , because every man is the same underneath his skin . And there is something in every man that 's bigger than himself , that belongs to the whole human race , from the beginning of time , something that belongs to God , something that 's decent . I 'm going to save your life , son . ( He stands , aims , fires . Joe shudders and turns , as the Hobo , holding the gun straight in front of him , moves forward easily . ) There you are . You 're on your way . You 'll thank me in a minute . ( Joe steps forward . The Hobo fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I told you , son . I said I was going to help you , and I am helping you . This is the best help there is . ( Joe hugs the tree again to keep himself from falling . He rubs his hand over the carved heart and initials . He turns suddenly and looks at the Hobo . ) Look at it this way . They 'd catch you before you got to Terre Haute . They 'd take you back and keep you there forever . You 'd never see the Portuguese girl again . You 'd never really live  --  ever . This way you 'll be in Juarez before you know it . You 'll be there a young man , strong and decent . The memory of your love for the Portuguese girl will always be decent . You 'll live forever , a young man in love . p. 20 HOBO ( Cont 'd ) I 've done you a great favor , son . The greatest . ( Joe barely manages to spit , and to throw the two silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , son . No matter what I do to help you , you keep hurting me . You should n't do that . The last thing you do on this side of the line , the dirty side of the line , ought to be something worthy of a decent young man in love . You ought to say something kind to me . Something kind to the human race . You do that , son , and you 'll be one of the aristocracy on the other side of the line , too . Say something kind to me , son . You have n't got much time . Say it before it 's too late . Do n't give up your superiority at the last minute . Do n't abdicate your aristocracy , son . Let your last breath be superior , let it be proud , let it be compassionate . JOE J. B. HOBO Yes , yes . Speak up , son . JOE Loves . HOBO That 's right , son . JOE L. O. ( He begins to slide down the tree . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is next . And I got you there . Say something for me , so I 'll know you understand . ( Joe spits and falls . ) The Hobo waits a moment , and then cautiously picks up the two silver dollars , turns Joe over , slips off his shoes , finds nothing . p. 21 HOBO He never had a chance . If I did n't do it , somebody else would have . And I need the money more than they do . Fair 's fair . I wanted to help him . I wanted to help him with all my heart , but I could n't . ( He gathers together his old clothes . ) I 'll just burn these , now . Anybody happens to ask me anything  --  he tried to kill me , I shot him in self-defense . It 's the truth , too . It 's the absolute truth . It was him or me . He should n't have been born , I guess . He was unlucky from the beginning . So long , son . Good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
