Somewhere on southeastern Hudson Bay fortnight ago solid ice or snow-drifted muskeg echoed back the hammering exhaust of a ski-shod plane flying north . Aboard were an inspector and a corporal of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , a doctor , a radioman , a pilot . They were headed for a barren mass of stone low on the surface of the Bay , the Belcher Islands . The reason for their flight was murder . <P> Into a Hudson 's Bay Co . Post where Great Whale River empties into the eastern waters of the Bay had trekked Trapper Ernest Riddell , the only white man on the Belcher Islands . To get there he had walked 60 miles over the ice to the main land . <P> The first radio message from the lonely post gave only the fact of murder , enough to start the Mounties on their 800-mile flight from Ottawa . But last week 's mes sages brought a fuller story . <P> Murder among the Eskimos is fairly in frequent , always logical . Most usual causes are shortages of wives or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a tradition of murder . Their forebears were banished there from the mainland 50 years ago for massacring the white men at Great Whale River . But this murder , according to Trapper Riddell , was a matter of theology . <P> Since the beginning of winter , two neighboring families had been wrangling over the second coming of Christ . One family firmly believed He would soon return to earth . All through the winter they kept their igloo ready for Him , kept their seal spears sharpened , their fishing nets mended . Their larder was always stocked with meat and skins . <P> To the neighbors this was nonsense . He would not come for " many-times-many-years . " But meanwhile the food and skins were there and might as well be used . All winter long the neighbors did not bother to hunt ; instead they cadged food from the believers , remarking : " If He is coming tomorrow , you surely have food for us too . " <P> In the end this was too much even for simple , gracious Eskimo hospitality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unbelieving family were killed . <P> When the Mounties get to the Islands , they will have little detective work to do . Eskimos do n't lie , and will probably tell umeealik , the boss man , all about it . If the inspector decides to bring the guilty family down to Moose Factory on James Bay for trial that will be fine , they will get a ride in an airplane and a chance to see a whole street of " igloo-pak , " the white men 's houses . <P> They might even be sentenced to be hanged , which would be too bad . But they are much more likely to go to jail , that Eskimo heaven where it is always nice and warm and there is nothing to do but eat and sleep .
