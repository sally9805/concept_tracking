Labor <P> The two big-bodied , grim-faced men sat in their green-walled hotel suites in Washington and listened as the President rawhided them over the radio . Alexander Fell Whitney 's lips were taut , his eyes were on the ceiling . He said not one word . Alvanley Johnston grunted only once , mumbling " Yes , sir , " when Harry Truman held himself up as " a friend of labor . " <P> Who were " these two men ? " Even their names were barely known to the country at large . Was Alexander Whitney any relation to the Whitneys ? Who was this man Johnston ? The people ( and the President ) hardly knew how to pronounce his first name ( Al-van-lee ) . <P> They looked exactly like what they are : oldtime railroad hands who had prospered after their retirement from hard labor . Alexander Fell Whitney is an affable man who asks almost everybody on second meeting to " Call me Al . " He is square-shouldered and peppery , a handsome , wavy-haired oldster ( 73 ) with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an " Important Man . " Alvanley Johnston stepped down from the cab of a locomotive and into a rumpled blue suit about 40 years ago . At 71 , his blue eyes still have the engineer 's squint , his round face the deep lines of a man who has long worked outdoors . <P> Neither is subtle , complex or daring . Whitney is a well-read man who likes to lace his speeches with literary allusions . Johnston ( nobody calls him Al ) is a plain , blunt man who almost never makes a speech , puts on a front of gruff irascibility . <P> The brotherhoods , forged in the fires and blood of the 1877 rail strikes ( see cut ) , now are rich , conservative , and strictly disciplined . Whitney and Johnston typify the transition . Each is a proud , rugged individualist who rules his tight little empire with strong hands , who has settled himself at the top of his union heap by keeping a strong thumb on the opposition . <P> " Miracle Man . " Al Whitney 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little schooling . At 15 he invested $2 in a basket of fruit and candy , boarded an Illinois Central train at Cherokee , and told the conductor that he was the new candy butcher . At 17 he was a brakeman , at 26 a freight conductor and a union member who applied evangelistic fervor to his fellow workers ' grievances . He got on the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen 's national payroll 43 years ago . He has never been off it ( present salary : $17,500 ) . He has bitterly fought his brotherhood 's conservatives as well as the railroads ' bosses . In 1928 , after 21 years as a vice president , he got what he had always wanted : the presidency . <P> Whitney loves acclaim : his official biographer refers to him as " the miracle man of railroad wage movements . " He considers himself a political leader on the liberal side , likes to quote Single-Taxer Henry George . He has lent his name to several left-wing organizations , some of them Communist-hued . He was an early and ardent supporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become his Secretary of Labor . <P> He lives on a scale befitting his eminence . There is an organ in his $50,000 lakeshore house near Cleveland . Outside , a small herd of deer and a covey of pheasants cavort on the grounds . His recreation room is equipped with Pullman berths for visiting union brothers .
