" A revolution is taking place in South Africa , " warned the Port Elizabeth Saturday Post . " It is not a noisy revolution , and there are no guns or street riots . . . Many thousands of people wo n't even know that there has been a revolution-till one day they wake up and find that they can never change their government . " <P> Prime Minister Daniel Malan 's Nationalist government , founded on the principle of apartheid ( racial segregation ) , hates Great Britain and despises the British liberal tradition . It is a government run by and for the tough Afrikaans-speaking burgers who make up 60% of the Union 's white population . A much-used Nationalist slogan : " One Country , One Flag , One Language " ( Afrikaans ) . <P> Parties &; Outlooks . Almost the first official act of the government last June was to release Sydney Robey Leibbrandt and others convicted of pro-Nazi agitation and anti-war activities during World War II ( TIME , June 28 ) . The government then rescinded Field Marshal Smuts 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Afrikaner Broederbond-to hold civil service positions . The Broederbond , of which Prime Minister Malan is a member and his Minister of the Interior , Dr. Theophilus Dnges , vice chairman , is now the real ruler of the Union of South Africa . The sinister secret society controls a good two-thirds of the government members of Parliament . <P> The Afrikaner Broederbond , in turn , is run by an executive of twelve who call themselves the Twelve Apostles . One of the apostles , billiard-bald Dr. Nicholaas Diederichs , Nationalist Parliament member for Randfontein , said in his maiden speech in Parliament : " The political position in South Africa is not an ordinary fight between two parties , but between two basic outlooks on life so fundamentally divided that a compromise between them is virtually unthinkable . " <P> The Malan government has already begun work on restricting immigration and tightening requirements for citizenship . Explained Dnges : " This aims at the protection of the State against a world outlook and an outlook on life foreign to that generally current in South Africa . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opposition voters , Malan coolly disfranchised the Natal and Transvaal Indians . Malan has announced that he proposes to eject from Parliament the representatives of the Negroes , and to deprive the " colored " ( mixed-blood ) voters of Cape Province of their direct franchise . The government already has passed a law compelling the Cape 's colored voters to appear before an electoral officer , magistrate or police officer to prove that they can actually write their names and addresses . Since most colored citizens prefer to steer clear of race-baiting Nationalist police officials , the effect of the new law will be to disfranchise thousands .
