A lone investor paid $2,550 for 100 shares of American Distilling Co. stock on Thursday , Sept. 30 . If he had happened to sell out at 11:45 a.m. on Wednesday , Oct. 27 , he would have made a gross profit of $4,150 . Even if he held on-which is much more likely-he would have ended the week with a paper profit of $3,725 , almost half of it chalked up during last week 's five and a half days of trading . Despite this dizzy boom , he might well think his shares were not overvalued . <P> Shades of Repeal . Last week 's rise in American Distilling was so sharp that SEC began looking under desks for manipulators . Not since the wild Repeal days of 1933 had distilling shares been so popular ; in fact , they were selling like bottles of whiskey . But probably SEC would find only that the market had belatedly recognized the wartime facts of distilling . All the whiskey shares were strong last week because-for the long term-whiskey stocks are scarce and the industry has finally given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday " from producing industrial alcohol . Result : the value of remaining whiskey inventories has climbed like a P-47 . <P> Within the past month one big liquor deal has gone through : Seagram 's $43,000,000 purchase of a 95% interest in Frankfort Distilleries . Two other big deals are bruited : Allied Mills may sell its whiskey subsidiary , Century Distilling Co. , for around $28,000,000 ; Park &; Tilford is dickering for Brown Forman . In all these deals the buying price is more than $100 per barrel of whiskey stocks-a good deal more than their value on the books of the small fry selling out . <P> Cash for the Little Man . For the small fry , that kind of cash on the barrelhead is a huge inducement : if they hang on and sell their liquor themselves , they are liable to excess-profits taxes running up to 90% . But if they sell out , they will merely pay the 25% tax on long-term capital gains . But for the big companies with low inventories , who must maintain their competitive positions , the reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskey stocks makes sense . Example : Seagram is the No. 1 North American liquor company in sales . But even after buying up Frankfort 's 400,000 bbl. of whiskey its total inventories of around 1,300,000 bbl. leaves it well behind Schenley , with 2,000,000 bbl. , and barely ahead of National 's 1,250,000 bbl . ( Hiram Walker , fourth in the Big Four , trails with some 900,000 bbl . ) <P> These facts touched off the American Distilling surge . For if &; when all the other deals go through , American will be about the biggest independent left . Wall Street is already awash with rumors that American , too , is not long for this world . In any case , at $100 each , its 200,000 bbl. of liquor translate into $80 for every one of its 250,000 shares of stock-v. a top price last week of 67.
