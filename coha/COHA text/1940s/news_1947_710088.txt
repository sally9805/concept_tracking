txt AIR FORCE THERAPY NOW AIDS CIVILIANS Patients Bedridden for Years Walk Again After Treatment at Bellevue Institute , By MEYER BERGER , Modern medicine 's version of the Scriptural " Take up thy bed , and walk " was movingly demonstrated yesterday in Bellevue Hospital . Child polio cases , men and women of advanced age who had suffered stroke , middle-aged folk who had rusted in bed for years for one reason or another literally ? left their cots in the hospital 's ninthfloor board room to move about on crutches or without artificial aid . The effect was so startling ? caught so many lay and professional watchers by the throat ? that the board room echoed to the rarest of all hospital sounds : wave upon wave of spontaneous applause . There were tears , too . The demonstration was staged by the Institute of Rehabilitation , which was started in Bellevue Hospital two years ago under Dr. George G. Deaver , Clinical Professor of Medicine at the New York University College of Medicine . The institute applies to civilian patients physiological and psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard A. Rusk , former chief of Army Air Forces rehabilitation , now associate editor of THE NEW YORK TIMES . Speakers at the demonstration ? Dr. Rusk , Dr. Deaver , Dr. Edward M. Bernecker , Commissioner of the Department of Hospitals , and Dr. Currier , dean of the New York University College of Medicine  --  predicted that the institute 's work would eventually put millions of bedridden on their feet . " The echoes of this demonstration , " Dr. said ; earnestly , " will be heard throughout this country ? throughout the whole world . " The speakers described the rehabilitation work as " the third phase of medical care , " taken up after work of prevention , diagnosis and treatment is ended . It helps the patient out of bed and teaches him how to live and work by himself . Wintry sunlight laid thin golden light on patient-faced children and adults , some in wheel chairs , some lying ? on mobile stretchers , some around a large work table , ; when witnesses were admitted to the board room at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receded . The doctors made their brief talks , told about the current campaign to raise $2,500 , - 000 in public contributions for a model Institute of Rehabilitation which is to be part of the proposed $15,575,000 New York University-Bellevue Medical Center . Then Dr. Deaver took over . He turned to Jim Brown , a grayhaired Negro patient stretched out under a white blanket . " Jim , " he explained , " is a stroke case .. He has never been out of bed since . " He turned to Jim . " Raise your leg , Jim , " he said . A thin leg rose unsteadily from under the blanket ; quivered , until a nurse gently let it fall back . " Now , " Dr. Deaver explained , " for more than a year and a half Jim has been in a bed ; has n't so much as reached for a glass of water for himself . " He placed a hand on thestretcher , and said , gently " Want to get up , Jim ? " and the patient murmured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The doctor nodded . " There 's no reason for this patient not to walk , " he said impressively . " He has been in this hospital only three days . Yet , if he has one good muscle in his legs , that 's all we need . Normal human beings use only 10 per cent of their faculties . There is a great reserve to be tapped in cases like this . " Dr. Deaver faced the patient again . " Get up and walk , Jim , " he said . The blanket was drawn back Jim raised himself unsteadily by his arms . His green-stockinged feet dangled over ? the stretcher 's ' sides . They touched the marble floor , with watchful nurses on either side of him . They held his arms . Then Jim walked  --  slow , tottering , feeble steps , but the sun was bright on his paralyzed left side . It etched a deep smile crease in the left side of his face . As the nurses guided him back to his bed the board room echoed to strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old , was exposed in all his skeletal thinness on another stetcher . He was a polio victim , flat on his back . " We 're going to put Al in braces , " Dr. Deaver said . " We 're going to get him up and make him walk . " He indicated the child , flat on the stretcher . " Nature never made muscles work in this position , " he told the audience . " We 're going to get Al up , are n't we , Al ? " The boy looked at him gravely . " Okay with me , " he murmured . Polio Victim , 5 , Walks They rolled Al away . Dr. Deaver looked toward a tiny wheel chair . In it sat Maureen Eagan of 625 Columbus Avenue , a 5-year-old in blue frock , red stockings , with gay ribbons in her blond braids , done pigtail . The doctor grinned at her . " Little Sweet , you 're , just getting out to walk , are n't you , Hon ? " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poliomyelitis case since she waz years , old  --  shuffled and tottered across the gleaming marble tile for eight or ten feet and fell in the doctor 's waiting arms . Dr. Deaver caught her up , and she hugged him , her golden head buried in his right shoulder . " She 's going to walk like any other girl , thank the Lord , " Dr. Deaver said huskily . " It is n't all done by us . " He set Maureen back on her feet to make her way back to the wheel chair . When she turned and grinned , safely seated , again the board room reverberated to wave on wave of applause . A young woman who had , spent five years in a . hospital bed , a broken back case , before ' the rehabilitation institute took her over , got up on steel-braced legs through her own strength and walked slowly across the floor on crutches , smiling . It was difficult and painful progress , but she covered ground . " She 's going back to her hus7 band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live , " Dr. Deaver said ; " and she will walk . She 's through with " hospital beds . " As the . girl navigated back Lo her chair there was another round of applause , and eyes were damp . Dr. Deaver called up Albert , a young man who lost his left leg in an automobile accident and had the other badly shattered just after he had enlisted in the Marine Corps . Grinning , he got about nimbly on crutches . Then Dr. Deaver had Albert stand by while he summoned William L. , a middle-aged , gray-haired man who had worked in a Bohack warehouse until last May , when a baffling ailment paralyzed him from head to toe . He was treated as a polio case because the doctors could not establish the true nature of his disease . He was kept in respirators , and seemed near death . He was taken to the Rehabilitation Institute on July 22 , after he had begun to twitch his hands a little . 8 Stages in Treatment Dr. Deaver used this man arid Albert the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is brought from bed to use of his limbs . Albert used his crutches to reach a mat placed on the board room floor . William L. slid down a three-step ramp to reach the mat . Both men rolled over onto their abdomens and started lifting exercises . " That strengthens their abdominal muscles , " Dr. Deaver explained . " You need them before you can use crutches . " Then the men lifted themselves off the mat with crutches only onefoot high  --  a device rigged up by the institute . This developed their arm muscles . They ran through the whole drill for prospective crutch users , as follows : Bed activity , wheel chair activity , mat activity , use of parallel bars , learning crutch balance , crutch walking , elevation activity ? getting up and , down steps designed to represent curbs and bus , or train , steps  --  and finally , hand activity . The former Bohack man , Dr. Deaver told the audience , has worked the paralysis out of ? his body . Soon it will leave- his feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first with crutches , then without , . to demonstrate how far he has progressed . The Marine , Dr. Deaver said , will get an artificial leg ? he has a six-inch stump below- the knee ? and will learn to walk so that no one will know the limb is not his own . " Now , " he said , " if we had left these men in bed , as we did before we came to know rehabilitation , cases like these would eventually become full of bed sores and infections . Rehabilitation gets them moving about , teaches them to , bathe , go to the bathroom , and then we get them started in the direction of jobs . " Inez , victim of a virus infection , , was brought forward on a wheel ' chair . She wore braces and crutches were at her right hand . ' She grinned up at the doctor , a saucy ' teen-ager in bright red sweater , with rich , bushy bob . " A little while ago , Inez , you did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She shook her head . At the doctor 's order she left the wheel chair and made leaping strides across the floor , swinging her legs confidently and freely in the braces . " Paralyzed from the waist down , " the doctor remarked . As Inez , flushed and laughing , got back with her swinging crutch stride , hands clapped in wild applause . " She 'll make a good secretary for somebody , " Dr. Deaver said as Inez wheeled away . " And best of all , she 's back home , now . Been in hospitals two years . " " Arthritic cases , stroke cases , some of many years standing , used crutches to get across the floor , some walked without . One demonstrated how he cared for himself , how he cut meat with a device that is knife and fork in one . Crippled children , children with amputations , demonstrated how they now tie their shoes , button their clothes , tidy themselves , work at little tasks that improve their arm and leg muscles  --  all presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rot in . bed , in. hospitals or at home . . Ralph Padavano , a Brooklyn boy who lost his right arm in an infantry attack on the French-German border , ? showed how he had , with the help of an artificial " limb , become ' an expert watchmaker at the Bulova plant . ' When the demonstration ended , Dr. Rusk introduced Harold Russell , who lost both hands , in the war , and who became an actor in the motion picture " Best Years of Our Lives . " - . Mr. Russell told- how he has . learned to use his hands .. He held - up the artificial limbs , grinned , and said : " If I could n't do anything ' else , I could always use them for picking ivy . " " , Dr. Rusk then announced that Samuel . Goldwyn , the motion - picture producer , has " pontributed $50 , - 000 ' toward-the-proposed model rehabilitationcenter . He cited statistics . to show that . for every man crippled in war ten are crippled in peace ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casualties , , and that if ? $300,000,000 were spent to rehabilitate 1,000,000 men , women and children , " - the income tax on - their increased . earnings would be more . than . enough : to pay'for the $3,000,000 spent to restore them to a useful ' role inhuman society .
