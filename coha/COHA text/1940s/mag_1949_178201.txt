On the afternoon of Aug. 10 , 1945 , Osamu Satano 's superior officers took him to an open field near the Fukuoka crematory in northern Kyushu . There Satano had to " volunteer " to behead a captured U.S. B-29 airman . After he had swung the executioner 's sword , Satano watched one of his officers torture another prisoner to death by shooting arrows at him . <P> Last week , in a musty military courtroom in Yokohama , 27-year-old Satano rose to be sentenced by a five-man military tribunal . Just before the sentence was pronounced , the defendant 's mother presented the embarrassed U.S. prosecutor with a bouquet of flowers . The court had decided that there were mitigating circumstances in Satano 's case-mainly the fact that he had killed under orders . The sentence : five years ' imprisonment . The defendant sighed happily with relief . <P> Satano 's judges might well have sighed with him . Since the U.S. first began conducting war crimes trials in Japan late in 1945 , 124 Japanese had been sentenced to hang , 62 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months to 50 years . More than 150 others were acquitted or dismissed . With the case of Osamu Satano , U.S. prosecutors closed their books . There would be no more war crimes trials in Japan .
