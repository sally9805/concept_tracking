Naval airmen won a hollow triumph last week . A new , high-sounding job was created : Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air . Its occupant : Vice Admiral ( upped from Rear Admiral ) John Sidney McCain , 58 , for ten months Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics , for seven years a naval aviator , for all his career a " battleship admiral " at heart . <P> The new job carries responsibility for plans , policy , personnel and logistics of naval aviation . It means official , though belated and only partial , acknowledgment of the airplane 's role in sea warfare . It still leaves the air arm 's influence in the Navy far less than that of the Air Forces ' in the Army . <P> Likable , leathery " Slutsie " McCain is a good officer ; in the Bureau of Aeronautics he has done a good job of supervising pilot training and the design and delivery of planes . He has listened to the argument of younger officers that unfettered air attack can blast the Jap out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But airmen point out that McCain was 51 and 30 years a Navy man before he won his wings , and that he has held air commands only since 1936 . Not even the appointment as new Chief of BuAer of Rear Admiral DeWitt C. ( " Duke " ) Ramsey , an oldtime pilot now commanding a task force in the South Pacific , eased the disappointment of the Navy 's air zealots.
