Every year , tens of thousands of lives could be saved in the U.S. if doctors throughout the country knew as much about treating stomach cancer as is known in a few topnotch medical centers . Dr. Carl A. Moyer of Dallas reported this conclusion last week to the Radiological Society of North America at Cleveland . <P> In an analysis made with Dr. S. H. Clayton , also of Dallas , Dr. Moyer found that 40,000 to 50,000 Americans get cancer of the stomach every year . Only one-tenth of the victims are operated on , and he believes that half the surgery patients die from the operation . <P> The heavy casualties , said Dr. Moyer , need not be . In the first place , four-fifths of the nation 's gastric cancer victims are suitable cases , for surgery . If operated on in time , there would be high hope for the majority of them . But the surgery available in most parts of the country is not good enough : although half the patients now die , there are " islands " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 dies . Among such islands : the Mayo Clinic , University of Minnesota Hospital and Manhattan 's Memorial Hospital . <P> The reason for the wide difference between the nation 's best and the nation 's average , said Dr. Moyer , lies in the difficulty of the operation . It takes a highly skilled surgical team to perform this difficult task , and there are few such teams available . To train 100 specialized teams , Dr. Moyer conceded , would be an immense job . But it might save 30,000 to 38,000 stomach cancer victims each year .
