The American stomach , A.M.A. 's doctors agreed , is not in very good condition . Ulcers are on the increase , up some 4% since the beginning of the war . Stomach cancer , a closely related horror ( many diagnosed " ulcers " turn out to be cancers ) , now kills 38,000 U.S. citizens a year - or one every 13.8 minutes . The doctors gloomily admitted that they have made small progress with either disease . <P> For Ulcers , there are two new palliatives : 1 ) a drug called asymatrine , developed by University of Georgia researchers , which generally stops intestinal spasms and pain ; and 2 ) a synthetic , acid-neutralizing resin called Amberlite IR , which seems to have less disagreeable side-effects than alkalis or gels . <P> Convention delegates showed plenty of interest in vagotomy , the nerve-cutting operation developed by Chicago 's Dr. Lester R. Dragstedt ( TIME , Aug. 26 ) , which is currently popular among ulcer specialists . But even that new hope was dampened by Dr. Russell S. Boles of the Philadelphia General Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form conclusions about this operation , it is not too soon to . . . protest against . . . a mass experiment on human beings that is fraught with potentially serious and permanent disabilities . " Dr. Boles 's warning : the vagus operation , which partially paralyzes the stomach , may produce diarrhea and vomiting , make it hard to get rid of food in the stomach . <P> Dr. Boles , who takes a dim view of all current treatments , including stomach surgery , suggested that the best ulcer patients can do is to stick to the doctor 's prescription as strictly as diabetics and tuberculosis patients . " In the light of our present knowledge , " said he , " I believe we should regard ulcer as an incurable disease . It may be held in abeyance , however , by cultivating a new manner of living . With some , this is easy ; with others who are involved in a squirrel-cage existence , it is difficult , if not impossible . " <P> For Cancer , there is even less hope : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doomed to die within five years . If caught in time , cancer can be cured by surgery , but by the time stomach cancer is detected , 80% of its victims are beyond the point where an operation will do much good . <P> The University of Pennsylvania 's Dr. Gilson Colby Engel protested that many stomach cancer deaths are unnecessary . X rays and the gastroscope can detect all but 8% of early cancers , said he , but neither patients nor doctors understand the need for such examinations . The average stomach cancer victim does not consult a doctor until 15 to 16 months after his symptoms begin . Anyone who begins to feel weak and tired , to lose his appetite for meat and to have indigestion before or after eating would do well to be examined at once for stomach cancer .
