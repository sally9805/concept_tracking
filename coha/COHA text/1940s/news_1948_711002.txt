txt Under the impact of the increased aggressiveness of the Greek Communist guerrillas and the increased aid extended to them by Russia 's Balkan satellites , the United States has again adjusted its Greek aid program to enable the Greek Government to increase its own military effectiveness . The Greek Army is to be increased by 12 , - 000 men to a total of 132,000 , and is to be used for a more vigorous campaign against the guerrillas , while the task of guarding the countryside against guerrilla raids , which has hitherto tied down most of the army 's manpower , is to be taken over by a National Guard raised to 50,000 men . Simultaneously , a still undetermined amount of surplus lend-lease equipment already in Greece , in particular ammunition , is to be turned over to the Greek Army to enhance its firing power , which has often been inferior to that of the wellequipped guerrillas . ? This is the second military expansion agreed to by the United States since the $300,000,000 aid program became effective . It will divert another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bring the total allotted to military purposes to $174,000,000 . But this revision of the program has been forced by the lessons of experience , . which have demonstrated that real reconstruction is ? impossible until there is security , and that neither efforts at reconciliation nor amnesties ' will stop the Communists as long as they have hope of ultimate triumph and are able to terrorize the population . They will retain this hope and ability as long as they can find support and shelter right across the border , where the Greek Army can not follow them . This raises the question whether even the new military measures will be adequate for their purpose . The Greek Government has long held that there is only one way of stopping the raids , and that is to seal off Greece 's northern border against further violations . Since the United Nations , although finding Greece 's nprthern neighbors guilty of aiding the kuerrillas , has been unable to do much about it , that end can be accomplished only by military force . This view is now shared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there are even suggestions that such action should be undertaken by United Nations or even United States troops . But such outside action appears to be at least premature as long as the Greek Government is confident of being able ' to accomplish - the same end with its own forces , provided it receives sufficient aid to raise its army to 200,000 men . That number is declared to be sufficient to seal off the more important border passages , and the battle of Konitsa has inspired new respect for the Greek Army even among the most skeptical . Such increased military action would consume an increased portion of the aid fund , and perhaps all . of it . But if it must be done it would still be far more economical and less hazardous to support the Greek Army than to send in our own troops . Any sum involved would still be a minor matter if the alternative to it should prove to be the collapse of Greece , and therewith the defeat of the Truman Doctrine and perhaps of the Marshall Plan .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
