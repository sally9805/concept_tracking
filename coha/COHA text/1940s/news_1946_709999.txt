txt Letters to The Times Coal Strike Discussed Long-Range Action Viewed as Need , Not Temporary Makeshifts To THE EDITOR OF TSB New YORK TIMES : Labor critics whose mouths and pens foam at the very mention of John L. Lewis ' name e are advised to watch their blood pressure . Regardless of the merits of the coal miners ' strike , the fact remains that the renewal of injunctions against strikers and their union officials leaves organized labor little alternative but to fight with all means at its command . I say this in realization of the stark truth that a new wave of strikes is neither in the public interest nor in the interest of labor . I say this in recognition of the fact that the present coal conflict hits the nation at a time when the American trade union movement as a whole needs public goodwill more than ever before . But before the American people are stampeded into approval of anti-strike court injunctions , let ue realize what we are doing . We had a forecast of that medicine not so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against an independent electrical workers ' group . This ill-advised step accomplished what nothing else could . It sparked united action by AFL , CIO and independent unions , with the result that the court ruling enjoining the strikers was hastily withdrawn . No , injunction will not cure the nation 's labor troubles . Nor will , as AFL President William Green warned , troops with bayonets or incarceration of union leaders produce a single ton of coal . Action of this kind merely embitters the participants , drives public mood to a fever pitch , and plays into the hands of radicals anxious to fish in troubled waters . What we need is constructive longrange action , not temporary makeshifts filled with economic and social dynamite . The remedy for the existing unhappy situation is not to be found in the revival of anti-labor witch hunts and measures of dubious legality . It lies in fair and just treatment for all alike and the enactment of an indus trial relations code with clearly defined areas of government responsibility and control  --  a labor ? code that , for once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALEXANDER S. LIPSETT . New York , Nov. 26 , 1946 . Substitution of Labor Courts To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The endorsement by Senators Fulbright and Ferguson of the proposal to substitute labor courts for ordeal by strike as a means for the settlement of labor disputes is welcome indeed . It brings two powerful advocates to a cause which has gained much ground since Judge Knox of our Federal district court focused public attention on it in an interview in October , 1945 . And , if Congress shortly enacts labor court legislation , Mr. Lewis , too , should receive some of the credit , for he has created precisely the climate of public opinion without which the development would be impossible . One must , however , disagree with the distinguished Senators on certain of the details . Mr. Fulbright has , he says , " no quarrel with the workers ' right to strike in industries where a stoppage has only a local effect or which merely inconveniences the public . " The general public , it is believed , feels differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tugboat strikes , steamboat strikes , elevator strikes , bus strikes , truck drivers ' strikes , waiters ' strikes , etc. , ad nauseam . Time was when private disputes were settled by private combat ; individual citizens had a right to settle them that way regardless of public inconvenience . This was the " right to fight . " The spectacle was not only costly but degrading , and the people finally put a stop to it and forced the combatants to take their disputes into a court of law . What we need now , before any more production is lost , is the imagination to devise an adjunct to our judicial system to deal effectively with industrial disputes . LESTER E. WATERBURY . New York , Nov. 27 , 1946 . Use of Navy 's Ships in Strike To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Since the coal strike is against the Government and people of the United States , it seems to me appropriate that the Navy assign its turbo-electric drive oil burning vessels to the task of breaking the strike by tying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal thus saved could be shipped to industries and sections out of reach of this relief . As an American citizen I would endorse such a move . J. ROBERT FISH JR . Agawam , Mass. , Nov. 27 , 1946 . Full Story Not Given To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Having just been discharged from the Navy , I arrived home , deep in the heart of the coal fields of Pennsylvania , and the area of varied public opinion . Within these past two weeks I have read papers from cities in Iowa , Illinois , Michigan , Ohio and a few other States condemning Mr. Lewis and his union followers . Why does n't someone really investigate a few facts ? A few admirable organizations have really done so , but , unfortunately , it has been only a few . If the public press could bring to its readers the story in its entirety there would not be so many so-called " traitors " in this country . The coal miners are not in any way comparable to the men working for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad engineers , firemen and the like , making in one month what some miners claim as savings accounts after years of " hard work . " Surely there must be an outlet for the facts as they really are . I am not a member of any union . but merely expressing the views of the boys still in the service not free to express their opinion , and believe me , some are more forceful than even I could express . So , from a son of a 65-year-old coal miner who has had forty years of coal mining behind him , how are chances on getting to the public another side of the story ? We are not as black as the coal on our faces , and not nearly as black as the conditions the , miners work in . D. GASPF2t . Sykesville , Pa. , Nov. 26 , 1946 . Aid Asked for Periodical Functions of the Survey Are Outlined in a Plea for Contributions To THE EDITOR or THE New Yong Taus : It would seem strange to your readers that I appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not THE TIMES , a great public institution devoted to the public service . You may not mind my presenting a comment of my friend H. N. Brailsford , the British Liberal publicist . He says all England is belated two weeks in its judgment of international affairs because it takes two weeks for THE NEW YORK TIMES to arrive across the Atlantic . I am appealing to you in behalf of the Survey magazine . You have given it your friendly interest through the last three decades , recognizing in it a , useful factor in our democratic process of education through the press . In one of its aspects the Survey is the organ of the profession of social work . It is an uncommonly intelligent organ , and indispensable . Everyone knows what a confusing and perplexing job the social worker has . But the Survey arrives , month by month , with its accounts of achievement in the field , its suggestion of new techniques , and stirs the faltering spirit of the social worker to new effort . For that alone the Survey deserves all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a profession apart . They are the missionaries of the social religion we all profess . The Survey could not have done its job as a merely professional organ . It had to grapple with the larger problems that . confront not only the social worker but all of us . This it does through the Survey Graphic . Too small a proportion of your readers know the splendid Calling America series , in which the Survey assembled an amazing group of writers to deal with issues of transcendent importance to us all  --  Latin America , race relations , labor issues , etc . It is not an easy time that faces us . There is much liquidation ahead of us , not only in wartime plants , but wartime institutions and ideologies . You of THE TIMES will do your job day by day , but will you not welcome an organ that , month by month , quarter by quarter , goes out and assembles the material on both sides of a crucial issue ? Would we not welcome a Calling America on coal , hospitable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides ? No wholly nonpartisan magazine can live by subscriptions alone . Most have great patrons . The Survey has no great patron and wants none . It wants . the support of the ordinary folk , who look tenderly on the face of every bill before they bid it farewell . Among the readers of THE TIMES there are a hundred thousand persons who agree with every word I have written here . They would contribute to the Survey Associates , a non-profit , tax-exempt corporation that publishes the Survey , if each one did not think , " Of course someone else will . " All faith is meritorious , but faith in someone else is of little help . JACOB BILLIKOPE . Philadelphia , Nov. 27 , 1946 . U. N. Delegates From India To THE : EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I refer to J. J. Singh 's letter in your issue of Nov. 27 . Begara Shah Nawaz and I are the official representatives of the All India Muslim League , the sole authoritative political organization of the Muslim nation , both men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are " the league 's unofficial delegates to the United Nations " or have anything do with the Indian delegation . India 's delegation was ; : eminated by the new Executive Council of the Viceroy - before the five nominees of the Muslim League entered and no Muslim leaguers are included in it . The delegation , therefore , does not represent the Muslim nation . It has been repeatedly declared in the press and from the platform by responsible members of the league that the delegation does not represent Muslim India . Yes , it is very interesting to note that out of the five delegates there are two Muslims , one a judge of the Bombay High Court and the other a represent- ative of the Indian princes , who has no concern with the politics of British India .
