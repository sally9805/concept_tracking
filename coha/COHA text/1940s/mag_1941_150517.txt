Last week Franklin Roosevelt reached a worm-turning point . Having tolerated strikes in defense industry for many months-until the public was fed up and Congress indignant-he either had to put up or curl up . The three strikes which put him in that spot were in the logging camps of the Northwest , in San Francisco shipyards , at North American Aviation , Inc. , in Inglewood , Calif . In each case strikers had arrogantly defied the Federal Government . In each case responsible labor leaders repudiated the strike . So finally the President spanked . <P> Plain to labor leaders , plain to everyone was the noisy nigger in the strike woodpile : Communism in labor 's ranks-the old Red policy of fomenting strikes because any kind of labor trouble is good for Communism , the old Red policy which since the beginning of World War II has been reinforced in the U.S. by Nazi cash . <P> Planes . Weeks of wrangling over demands for higher wages at North American ( strikers at Vultee had boosted a 50 minimum to 62 ) had got nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the National Defense Mediation Board , which summoned management and union leaders to Washington . The C.I.O. union agreed not to strike during negotiations . Management promised to make any settlement retroactive to May i . But in the middle of negotiations , William P. Goodman , local union spokesman , bawled that the company was " stalling , " and the Inglewood local walked out . Work on some $200,000,000 worth of U.S. and British contracts for bombers , pursuit planes and combat trainers ceased . <P> Congress grew apoplectic ; even labor leaders " condemned and denounced " the walkout . From the White House came an order to reopen North American 's plant . If necessary , the plant would be put under Army operation and protection . The Presidential ultimatum gave strikers only a few hours to get back to their tools . <P> Franklin Roosevelt 's choice was easy compared to Philip Murray 's . With labor misbehaving , the President 's method of slapping it down was to seize the plant of the employer . C.I.O. President Philip Murray could not slap anyone except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been harassed by Communists , who became entrenched in C.I.O. ranks under the more tolerant leadership of John L. Lewis . A practical Catholic , Murray has no love for Reds . C.I.O. 's United Automobile Workers , which took over aircraft organizing , has been particularly plagued with them . <P> Murray sent hefty Richard Frankensteen , national director of U.A.W. 's aviation division , to Inglewood , where Frankensteen broadcast a warning to workers to go back to work or forfeit affiliation with the C.I.O. Said he : " The infamous agitation , the vicious maneuvering of the Communist Party is apparent . "
