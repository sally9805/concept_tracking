The skier who outjumped them all , Torger ( " Old Iron Legs " ) Tokle , used to say that if the ski jump at Steamboat Springs , Colo. were fixed up a bit , a new U.S. record could be set there . He did not live to see it : Sergeant Tokle of the skiborne 10th Mountain Division was killed in Italy . <P> This week , with Steamboat Springs properly improved , four ski jumpers had no trouble breaking Tokle 's course record of 248 feet , and three others tied it . <P> Tokle 's old No. 1 competitor , Norwegian-born , 36-year-old Alf Engen of Sun Valley , set the new course record at 259 feet to win the first National Ski Championships since 1942 . His leap was still 30 feet short of Tokle 's U.S. record jump , made off Michigan 's Iron Mountain in 1942-and far short of the 300-ft. jump that Tokle had predicted for Steamboat Springs .
