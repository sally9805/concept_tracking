What has happened to all the cheap textiles-the 98 dresses , dollar work clothes , 39 aprons , 25 socks ? The dearth of these bargain-basement specials has graveled many a low-income shopper , and given many a housewife to wonder whether OPA is really succeeding in holding the line . This same question last week bothered Economic Stabilizer Fred Vinson . He issued orders to WPBoss Don Nelson and OPA Boss Chester Bowles to increase supplies of these inexpensive soft goods . <P> The paradox is that these low-priced textiles do not exist mainly because OPA has succeeded in keeping prices down . But OPA 's victory has also been the consumers ' loss , because manufacturers of " low-end " goods , between soaring labor and raw materials costs on one side and inflexible ceilings on their prices on the other , found themselves squeezed out of profits . Result : they largely quit civilian production-and " upgraded " the rest . Half of production went into military orders . The other half became " higher-quality " merchandise-sometimes a matter of adding as little as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling prices nets a profit . <P> With the doors and windows locked against it , inflation has thus been tunneling under the house , in a new manner . Low-income consumers do not benefit from a tight ceiling on a commodity that does not exist . But every union dues-payer knows that the lack of merchandise in the low-price brackets is a main factor in the cost of living . <P> Nelson 's problem is to force the industry back to production of cheap goods , even if this means sales at cost , as suggested by Stabilizer Vinson . Bowles 's assignment is to search for ways to raise producers ' ceilings-without lifting the lid too much on retail prices . <P> But with no top to raw cotton prices , and with textile labor agitating for higher wages in 1944 , the textile industry is skeptical.
