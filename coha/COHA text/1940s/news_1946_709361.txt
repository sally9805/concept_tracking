txt A CHALLENGE TO UNO Russian Move Raises a Problem of Right to Rule Its Affairs 2-WEEK HALT ASKED Soviet Plea , Our Plan to Go On , Australian Compromise Studied By JAMES B. RESTON The Security Council of the United Nations overruled the Soviet Union yesterday and placed Iran 's charges against the Red Army on the agenda , but it postponed until today a decision about pursuing the substance of these charges when the Soviet delegate said he would not discuss them or attend meetings on the charges until April 10 . This was not a threat by the Soviet Union to leave the organization on its first business meeting in New York . It was not a protest against the right of Iran to state its case eventually ; nor was it a challenge to the UNO to take jurisdiction over the case . But it was a challenge by the Soviet Union to the organizaV on 's right to conduct its business as it pleased . It was , in effect , a demand to veto the majority even on procedural questions . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union is charged with interfering in the domestic affairs of Iran and threatening international peace and security , and it presented the young organization with a moral problem equal to , if not greater than , the political problem that brought it up . Council Sidesteps Issue The Council sidestepped this issue , after nearly six hours of debate yesterday morning and afternoon , by setting up a subcommittee to clarify three motions before it ? one to postpone discussion until April 10 , one to hear the Iranian side of the case before deciding on the postponement issue , and the third to call on Iran to place its case before the Council in writing and study the case at a more leisurely pace . This parliamentary device  --  setting up a subcommittee  --  which was often used in such cases in the League of Nations at Geneva and was put forward today by an old League of Nations supporter , Ambassador Henri Bonnet of // France , managed to postpone the fundamental issue but it did not avert it . M. Bonnet was named chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byrnes and Soviet Ambassador Andrei A. Gromyko are the other members . The issue , it is generally agreed , is clear . It is not primarily the Iranian case today . It is the issue of whether any one member of the organization is to have the right to keep the organization from functioning under the Charter . Aside from the moral aspects of the question  --  aside from what the Netherland Foreign Minister during the debate clearly referred to as the " pressure " that was being applied on the other members of the Council by the Soviet Union ? the Charter can not function properly with the Soviet Union absent . Absence Could Mean Veto It can not do so because the Charter states that questions of substance in the Security Council must be determined by a vote of seven of the eleven members , including the " concurring votes of the permanent members . " It is , of course , possible that the Soviet Union would be declared a party to the Iranian dispute , and in that event it would not have a vote in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other questions that might arise , the Soviet Union could veto a decision merely by its absence . Until this fundamental issue was raised , the first meeting of the organization in New York went along about as had been expected . As in London , the Council was having its growing pains . Lacking any rules of procedure , it was constantly in the middle of endless parliamentary wrangles , but these were dismissed as the inevitable consequences of a new institution whose members were accustomed to different methods of procedure and whose committee of experts , though formed in January , had not yet produced any agreed set of rules . The threat not to attend the meetings until it was convenient for Moscow to discuss the case , however , presented the members with a more serious issue . It should be stated that most of the delegates do not think that the Soviet Union is seeking time to carry out some specific plan of infiltration or aggression in Iran . Nor do they doubt that some sort of informal understanding was reached between the pro-Soviet Iranian Premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iranian Parliament ceased to function several days ago . But they point out that in these days of rapid modern war , the Council can not allow itself , for any reason , to be paralyzed by the action of one member  --  especially when the case under discussion is one in which the member seeking postponement is charged with threatening the was defeated when it was supported only by the U.S.S.R. and Poland . A subsequent amendment to put the case in the agenda was approved by the United States , Britain , China , Australia , Egypt , the Netherlands , France , Mexico and Brazil , two more than the necessary seven . ' the Soviet case was that the Iranian appeal was not a fitting subject for the Council . This was because , said Gromyko Mr. Mr , the more difficulty the Council had true , in making the parliamentary procedure work without rules of procedure . Indeed by the end of the were scheduled to leave the country under the terms of the 1942 Anglo-Russian-Iranian agreement . Since the Iranian appeal had been made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 lines prejudice to the decision as to whether the question would then be postponed . This was supported by both Mr. Byrnes and Six Alexander Cadogan , but Mr. Gromyko 's observation on this point was that , by deleted 2 lines Charter , and had also discharged its obligations under the January 30 decision of the Council , Council Chamber at Hunter College , the Iranian Ambassador , Hussein Ala , sat in the front row listening to testimony . When Mr. Gromyko finished his opening deleted 16 lines what we do here . A great power , , is vested in us . We must use it , wisely . " Every member of the Council knows the interests of the Iranian Government are vitally tary of State for Foreign Affairs , and now the representative of his Government on the Council , supported Mr. Byrnes and made his case somewhat more specific . He asked that both sides report ? fully  --  on " all " the terms of this new Soviet-Iranian understanding , and he indicated some skepticism over the official Soviet statement that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks " if nothing unforseen happens . " This new " understanding , " he said , evidently indicates some sort of change in the Anglo-SovietIranian treaty of 1942 , under which all foreign troops were supposed to be out of Iran on March 2 , last . He said that for that reason the United Kingdom not only was interested , as a party to the treaty , but had made inquiries in Moscow deleted 5 lines observed , was a " slight departure " from the terms of the 1942 agreement and the Council was therefore confronted not only with the legal aspects of the question but with the moral fact that the " confidence " of nations in the sanctity of international treaties was involved . Solution of Rules Essential The longer this debate went on the Soviet Union had reached what the interpreter at first translated as an " agreement " and the Soviet day most of the experts in the Ambassador later changed to an Chamber agreed that this problem " understanding " with the Iranian deleted 6 lines guaranteed the right of a state to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not see that there could be any doubt that Iran 's interests were involved in this case . But there was no way ferences by negotiation , mediation , arbitration or other means of their own choice ( Article 33 ) before bringing them to the Council . By negotiating with the Iranian Government , Moscow had thus , he concluded , settled the main probtates of common sense . " Moreover , he added , since the Iranian Premier had reached an under deleted 6 lines the Charter until he was clearly out of patience , and then he let himself go . " This is a rather remarkable ' proceeding , " he said . " The Iranian sociated Press quoted . He can hear , everybody speak for a government , ' but he ca n't speak for his own government . Council and say so . At any rate , he insisted , the Iranian delegate must have the right to be heard . Sir Alexander Cadogan , former British Permanent Under-Secreaffected by this motion to postpone . " Mr. Gromyko replied to this merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that the Council was discussing merely the procedural aspects of the question and had not yet decided to get into the substance . Then he went on to repeat his warning about what the Soviet Union would do if the Council insisted on discussing the substance of the matter before April 10 , adding : " I will repeat , in order to insure an exact interpretation of what I have said , that in view of the reasons given in my letter to the Secretary General  --  the letter that I addressed in the name of the Soviet Government to the Secretary General of the United Nations on March 19  --  and in view of the reasons I have given in the course of the discussions of the Security Council today , I could not , as representative of the Soviet Government , participate in or attend meetings of the Security Council in which the Security Council discussed the substance of the question raised by the Iranian Ambassador 's letter . Furthermore , to invite the representative of Iran to participate in the deliberations of the Security Council at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of a treatment of the substance of the question . " Although Mr. Gromyko asserted that he could not discuss the substance of this case before April 10 , he never once said why he could not . He just said he could not . Then he said it again . Then he repeated it once more . And finally Dr. van Kleffens commented on this point . " I am a little disappointed , " the Netherland delegate remarked , " that the delegate for the Soviet should have suggested that his Government could not consent to a discussion before April 10 because I feel that if the Council thinks there should be a discussion  --  and I am not anticipating that question because I want to see the representative of Iran sitting at the table and hear what he says about postponement before I make up my mind  --  but if the Council came to the conclusion that there should be a discussion , . I do not think any individual member should paralyze such action or announce in advance , because that is ' a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , that it would not take part . " By 5:30 P. M. when most of the spectators had wearied of the legal testimony , Dr. Quo had on his list three motions . The first was Mr. Gromyko 's to postpone . The second was the Egyptian motion to hear the Iranian case so that the Council would know what it was postponing . The third was an Australian amendment , proposing that the Iranian be invited to state its case in writing and that the Council get all the documentary evidence at hand before hearing the case in full . At this point , while Dr. Quo was patiently trying to juggle these ' without any rules , the French Ambassador said that he did not think the motions were so far apart and that a sub-committee should be created to bring the three together . For example , the Ambassador said , the Council might decide to defeat the Soviet proposal and then , after getting into the substance of the issue , find they really did not have sufficient information on which to base judgments after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to produce a compromise and report back by 3 o'clock this afternoon . To this the Council , more out of hunger than faith , agreed , and Dr. Quo gave M. Bonnet the job of getting Mr. Gromyko and Mr. Byrnes together .
