txt Massachusetts taxpayers will benefit to the extent of $3,000,000 a year under a liberalized social security program just approved by the national House of Representatives , Patrick A. Tompkins , State Commissioner of Public Welfare . announced today . Adoption of the program , regarded as assured in welfare circles , will not add to Massachusetts ' above-the-average assistance allowance of $63 a month , but would apply entirely to the tax structure of the State and municipal government , explained Mr. Tompkins . Under the terms of the new legislation , the Federal Government would match State payments of $25 a month , or less , for all cases of old-age assistance . The rate now stands at $20 a month . More Children 's Aid This would mean , according to the Commissioner , that half the cost of caring for the elderly and the blind , also included , whil receive less than $50 a month , would be borne by the Federal Government . About half of the 80,000 old-age assistance cases in Massachusetts fall in this category . In addition , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the State for dependent children . The present $9 monthly maximum for the first child would go to $13.50 ; the $6 a month for other children would be increased to $9. - The effect would be to raise the total benefits paid by local , State , and Federal government from $18 to $27 a month in the first category and $12 to $18 a month in the second . Relief to the tax structure in : lassachusetts would total about $700,000 annually , all to cities and towns ; from this one form of increase , The Commonwealth itself could not benefit , as a statute fixes the State contribution at one third of the total allowance for each case . State and Local Benefits At present , the proposed Federal contribution to old-age assistance would lift about $2,100 , - 000 from State and local costs , according . to Mr. Tompkins . He estimated that the Commonwealth 's present old-age assistance case load of 80,000 ? climbing rapidly  --  would mean $175,000 a month . in additional Federal funds . Old-age assistance cases for May , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totaled 79,967 , with Federal-Statemunicipal expenditures amounting to $3,660,963 , Approximately 8,200 families receive assistance known as aid to dependent children at a monthly average of $84.30 , the Commissioner disclosed . Federal contributions to the costs of this category was $144,900 in the Bay State in May , he added . The monthly balance . sheet for old-age assistance , aid to dependent children , and general relief , all handled by the Welfare Department , make its budget one of the bigeest in the State . Reclassifying of Cases ? One feature of the proposed liberalized grant would be a large transfer of general relief cases to the aid to dependent children category , the Commissioner predicted . The Federal Government pays nothing toward the care and maintenance of families and persons in the general relief bracket . The entire burden is borne by the State and local government . Heretofore , cities and towns in Massachusetts have favored this type of assistance and its much lower allowances as costing them less than aid to dependent children . Under the anticipated Federal increases for the latter category , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second thought to classifying an applicant for assistance as a case for general relief . Formula Criticized About 34 per cent of the families and individuals on general relief are eligible for benefits under aid to dependent children , the Commissioner asserted . In May , the Public Welfare Department paid out an average of $48.94 to 4,500 families and of $30.53 to 9,000 individuals on general relief . The total for the month was $274,457 , according to the Commissioner . Although appreciative of the increased Federal grant as proposed by the new bill , Commy , imple Tompkins had one criticism . The welfare program is not based on the best possible formula , he stated . " Welfare should be based on need from a national viewpoint , " he said . " The best program is believed to be one containing a variable grant depending upon need . the average national income and the average income of the State , " he continued . Plan Defended " Such a proposal , while it had the support of welfare leaders in both parties in Massachusetts , lost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affluent , would benefit at the expense of the northern states , " the Commissioner stated . " Limits would necessarily be placed on Federal grants under such a plan , " he said , " to prevent the National Government from having to assume the entire relief burden during a depression . " Reviewing the proposed program now moving through Congress , the Commissioner estimated that 50 per cent of the entire Federal fund reckoned at $27. , 000,000 would go to five states . These were Massachusetts , New York , California , Washington , and Colorado , all with high standards and benefits for the aged and needy .
