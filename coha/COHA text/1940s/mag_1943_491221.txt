famous air ride to Tokyo . It was with Rickenbacker through his long ordeal in the Pacific . There were Citadel men on Bataan and Corregidor , in the Iceland occupation , in the bloody Commando exploit at Dieppe . There are Citadel men on New Guinea and Guadalcanal  --  in fact , there are so many of them in those far regions , ranging from generals to lieutenants , that , at a certain base down under , one street of tents is known as Citadel Row . In North Africa , Citadel men are so numerous that whenever a lull comes in the fighting there is talk of forming a Citadel North African Club . And to these already in service many more will soon be added . Immediately after the commencement in May , the entire first and second classes , about 500 men , will go into the Army as officers , after a brief interval in training camps ? an interval which will be very brief because The Citadel , rated " Excellent " by the War Department and pushing West Point hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly all that they need to know . That is why the centennial exercises on the parade ground of the fine new plant on historic Ashley River and in the cadet chapel , one of the most beautiful in the South , will be simple and short . At first it was intended to give a week to the exercises , but when war came it seemed best to give only a day  --  March twentieth . More grimly than ever before The Citadel is at work , and now time is precious . For again , as has happened more than once in its eventful hundred years , it is called upon to play its part in the kind of national crisis with which , if its theory of education be sound , it is peculiarly fitted to deal . The soundness of that theory will hardly be questioned at this juncture Established by the state  --  its full title is The Citadel . the Military College of South Carolina  --  primarily to prepare young men for civil life by giving them a thorough education reinforced with thorough military training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again brought the institution brilliantly to the fore in time of stress . These occasions ? and they include the most dramatic episode in the life of any American school  --  we shall come to later . First , a glance at the place as its hundredth birthday finds it . Out of the Ashes It is a hundred years young , not old . In the past few years it has grown faster than ever before . Younger than Norwich University in Vermont , Pennsylvania Military College and the Virginia Military Institute , The Citadel is now by far the largest of this group often designated as the distinguished and distinctively military group of colleges . It has won to this eminence through periods of varying fortune and , at times , of seemingly irretrievable disaster . Its darkest days came after the War Between the States , when its buildings were occupied by Federal troops until , in 1882 , it resumed its sessions with Col. John P. Thomas as superintendent . In the Late 80 's and 90 's , when Ben Tillman led his agrarian jihad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitchfork wielder roared at The Citadel as a " dude factory , " and again its days seemed numbered . But Tillman , able himself and sobered by responsibility , discovered that the " dudes " made able and useful citizens , and under the euperintendencies  --  the title was later changed to president  --  of Gen. G. D. Johnston , Col. Asbury Coward and Col. 0 . J. Bond , The Citadel continued to grow . A score of years ago it outgrew its old quarters in the center of Charleston and moved to a fine new plant at the city 's edge , with plenty of room for the further expansion which the future seemed to promise . and in 1931 an even more remarkable development began when Gen. Charles Pelot Surnmerall , retiring after a distinguished career in the Army , of which he was Chief of Staff , assumed the presidency of The Citadel . Under General Summerall 's vigorous leadership the institution has much more than doubled in size ; its enrollment at the beginning of the present term was 1957 . If it was once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . Its faculty represents every section of the country ; its cadets come from forty-four states , and more than 500 of the 1957 come from outside the South . This year , for instance , the first cadet captain is W. A. Pashley , of Kansas ; the second cadet captain is H. L. Beckington , of Illinois . D. M. Fort , of Illinois , commands the second battalion . G. K. Webb , of Ohio . heads the third battalion . while George Daniels . a native of Michigan , is regimental adjutant . For an equally good geographical cross section , take this year 's color guard . The eight men forming it bail from Minnesota , New England . South Carolina , Georgia , Maryland and Washington , D. C. With this growth and broadening of its personnel , both its scholastic and its military structures have been broadened and strengthened and its facilities enormously increased . Scholastically , it is today a fully accredited senior college on the approved list of the Association of American Universities and of the Engineers ' Council for Professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-running the highest rating which the War Department gives . Physically , its plant is so extensive and so well adapted to its purpose that it is beyond all question the finest and most complete strictly military college property in the United States , except the national academy at West Point . These . perhaps , are prosaic facts , but important . Never before have the American people realized so clearly the value of the military code and military training as part of a citizen 's educational equipment , and it is well for the public to know where these things may be had . They may be had at The Citadel at a yearly cost of $500 for state cadets and $6.50 for outof-state men . But these facts , though they have their place , are n't The Citadel . The Star of the West The Citadel is n't figures and statistics . It is n't the spacious square of imposing gray buildings on the bank of the Ashley River . It is n't even the regiment of smartly uniformed young men drilling on the palm-bordered parade ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture rooms . Rather , The Citadel is a story  --  a story which might even be called an American epic . That sounds extravagant , but this story is part of the central thread of America 's own story in the most crucial hour of the nation 's life . No shot had yet been fired by North or South and the question of peace or war hung in the balance when one day a steamship was sighted off Charleston , heading for the harbor . It was the United States ship Star of the West , bringing reinforcements and munitions for the Federal garrison holding Fort Sumter . In anticipation of such an attempt , a battery had been erected at the harbor entrance and had been occupied by a detachment of Citadel cadets . The task of these boys , called from their classrooms to man the South 's cannon , was to stop at any cost any vessel trying to reach Fort Sumter from the sea . Certainly no other American school and no other group of American schoolboys ? for they were hardly more than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To fire upon the Star of the West meant war . These boys met their responsibility unflinchingly . The Star of the West came on . When there was no doubt about her purpose to reinforce Fort Sumter , the superintendent of The Citadel , Maj. P. F. Stevens  --  after the war he became a bishop  --  gave the command , " Commence firing ! " The cadet captain passed the order , " Number One , fire ! " Cadet G. E. Haynsworth , of South Carolina . pulled the lanyard and the first shot of the War Between the States went hurtling across the water . There was another shot immediately afterward , then another , and for some minutes the firing was general . The Star of the West , hit just abaft the fore rigging and narrowly escaping disablement by a shot which almost carried away her rudder , slowed , turned and headed out to sea . The Citadel had given the South its first victory  --  bloodless and small in itself , but ushering in the mightiest drama this continent has seen . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then came Manassas , Chancellorsville , Gettysburg and Appomattox . Seventy-two years after the cadet artillerymen had turned back the Star of the West , a significant event took place on the parade ground of The Citadel . In the spring of that year , 1933 , a cadet named A. B. Sundin won the Star of the West medal . This is a medal awarded each year since 1893 to the bestdrilled Citadel cadet  --  a medal deriving ( Con/inuod on Pogo 103 ) ( Confintmd from Page 100 ) its name from the fact that it contains a piece of oak wood from the Star of the West 's hull . Cadet Sundin  --  now Lt. Col. Sundin , of the U. S. field artillery ? had come to The Citadel from Massachusetts and was the first Yankee to win this emphatically Confederate trophy . The second Yank to win it is the present holder of it  --  Cadet C. J. West , of Hudson . New York  --  and in showing it to the writer the other day , he remarked that the moment when he won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly something for Hitler and Hirohito to put in their pipes and smoke . And , in passing , here is another . In 1863 the Confederate General Beauregard presented to The Citadel a fifteeninch cannon ball fired by the Federal fleet at the defenses of Charleston . At the close of the war this souvenir came into possession of the Federals and was taken to the United States Military Academy at West Point , where it remained for many years . Nevertheless , you can see it on display at The Citadel today because in 1913 Secretary of V ! ar Stinson personally ordered its return  --  a gracious and graceful gesture which did its bit to make the Republicwhole and strong again for the great test that Pearl Harbor began . Sons of Rattle Indeed , looking back from Pearl Harbor and Bataan and Guadalcanal , one sees the Star of the West and Fort Sumter and Gettysburg as earlier chapters of the same great story . The Citadel , in the forefront of events in that first decisive hour , emerged four years later with a record probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Virginia Military Institute the distinction of wearing on its regimental colors a battle streamer authorized by the United States Government for having gone into action as a unit of the Confederate Army . Actually , The Citadel participated as a military unit in eight operations of the War Between the States , in recognition of which fact it flies , besides the Government streamer , eight other streamers awarded by the state . Of these . eight occasions , the most notable in its consequences was that already described  --  the episode of the Star of the West , when it fell to The Citadel to fire the first gun of the war . Most strangely it was also the lot of this school to fire the last shot east of the Mississippi River when , on May 1 , 1865. a detachment of cadets beat off an attack by Federal cavalry . Between these two actions , marking the beginning and the end of the great struggle , the most important service of The Citadel was performed when the heavily outnumbered Confederate forees were trying to check the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty grins undertaking for a battalion of boys in their teens ? some were as young as fifteen  --  but , ordered to attack near the Tulifinny River , they went forward with complete steadiness against the seasoned and victory-flushed troops in their front . The engagement lasted about three hours and at the end of it the enemy had been driven hack . Thereupon a bearded veteran of the Virginia campaigns paid the beardless cadets a compliment . " Them fellers fight Like Hood 's Texjeans , " he observed casually to a comrade , and the remark has become a Citadel tradition . Something more than a year ago newspaper renders may have noticed the following dispatch : MONTREAL , JAN. 27 . ? ( AP ) Corporal Dick Doherty , twenty , and Private Joe O'Malley , nineteen , fellow cadets at The Citadel , military college in South Carolina , today enlisted with the Black Watch Royal Highland Regiment ) of Canada after thumbing their way 1200 miles from Charleston , S. C. They arrived in Montreal wearing the uniforms and colorful red shoulder capes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle dress of the Canadian army . O'Malley is a native of St. Louis , while Doherty hails from Chicago . Corporal Doherty and Private O'Malley had excellent Citadel precedent for what they were doing . They were quitting their classrooms and going to war on their own . Eighty years before them . other cadets did the same thing . The school as a unit  --  between tours of field duty it was carrying on its classes  --  was n't seeing enough action to suit these exuberant youngsters . Thirty-six of them decided to play hooky for the duration and go where the going was hot . They did that . They walked out of school one day in ' 62 , formed a cavalry troop of their own , known as the Cadet Company , joined the hard-fighting Sixth Regiment and  --  careless of the zeros presumably being marked up against them in the classrooms  --  proceeded to spill their young blood on the battlefields of Virginia and Carolina . Their story , including Trevilian Station ? one of the biggest cavalry battles ever fought on this continent  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citadel were awarded a battle streamer for every battle in which the Cadet Company took part , it would fly so many streamers that the regimental flag might not he visible at all . The Blue and the Gray So it was good Citadel practice that Doherty and O'Malley were following . Now , to show what time hath wrought , take note that Doherty came to the Citadel from Chicago . while O'Malley hailed from Missouri . That is the way now with this " Confederate stronghold , " to quote a recent reference . It is full of Yankee blood from all over , its Yanks hold their full share of its honors and its " rebel " medals , and together its Yanks and Rebs are giving one of the finest exhibitions of Americanism conceivable  --  they have put The Citadel in the van of this war for American freedom just as truly as it was in the van of that other war . To see the picture , and see it whole and get its full fine meaning , your eye must take in the whole broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , life at The Citadel  --  never an easy life because military training there is thorough and discipline real ? goes on . The war has caused changes and adjustments , but the old customs persist . There is no hazing , but neither is there relaxation of the rigid Rat Regulations by means of which Rats are kept always and painfully aware that they are Rats . About the only change which has come about in their status is found in the fact that once , long ago , they were called Plebes . Similarly , third clansmen were then called Upstarts and this designation survives , whereas the goodly titles given second and first clansmen , Demigods and Sublimes , have regrettably lapsed with the years . The Citadel code , too long to quote here , is an admirable statement of ideals ; an unwritten code concerns itself with lesser matters . No fist fight is permitted to mar the dignity of the campus . No cadet smokes or eats in the street  --  a rule founded upon a sound theory of man-ners . Many and various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citadel ( Continued on Page 10S ) fCo , , nv.d from Pap . 1031 custom approves of only one way . It is said that today in the foxholes of the Sol-oman Islands one can spot The Citadel men by th'o way their shirts  --  if any  --  arc tucked in . But none of this leads to a slav-ish uniformity or a stifling of initiative . In the entire universe there are nefirmer believers in military training , its codes and customs , than these young men , who cer-tainly should know whereof they speak . ( Continued from Pose 1B ) Finally , there is another important fact about The Citadel  --  to many readera the moat interesting of all . Not merely passively , as in most nonmilitary colleges , but actively and , under General Summerall , even militantly , religion is the controlling principle of the institution and its work . To some this will be surprising for most people do not associate the military and the religious ideals . They forget that in the South these two have been conspicuously associated . They forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of soldier that walked ' cry humbly before God . That is the kind of soldier and the kind of man The Citadel tries earnestly to produce , and that is another reason for saluting it with respect as it celebrates its centenary March twentieth .
