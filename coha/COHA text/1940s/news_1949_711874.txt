txt Joseph F. , jury clerk , denied yesterday that in the selection of jurors he ever discriminated against anyone for reasons of race , color , creed , sex , or political , social or economic status . Mr. ? testified as the first witness for the Government in defense of the Federal jury system at the trial of the eleven Communist leaders . He was called to the stand after Judge Harold R. Medina , on the basis of a previous finding of " willful , deliberate and concerted delay , " temporarily halted the defense attack on the system . The defense is trying to prove that the system unconstititionally excludes from juries Negroes , Jews , women , poor people , manual workers , and members of the Communist and American Labor parties . It says the defendants can not get a fair trial from an impartial jury under this system . Therefore it asks the voiding of the indictment and the quashing of the trial-jury panel . Ry the challenge to the jury the defense for four weeks has delayed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiracy to advocate the overthrow and destruction of the Government . At the opening of court yesterday morning Judge Medina called for the statement that last Friday he had directed defense counsel to prepare on the additional evidence they intended to present . Abraham J. Isserman of defense counsel protested against this requirement as " unreasonable , " but handed ' up the statement . The judge said he would study it later . He took it to his chambers for the mid-morning recess , which ran longer than usual . When he again mounted the bench , he carried in his hand the halfdozen sheets of yellow paper that comprised the defense statement . Then he waited patiently while Prof. Doxey Wilkerson , Communist expert witness on the jury system , who has been on the stand eleven days , finished his testimony . Just before the time came for the regular lunch-time adjournment , the judge announced : " Now that the testimony of this witness is concluded , I find the memorandum submitted to me this morning by defense counsel is wholly insufficient . Therefore , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without precluding defense counsel as to what they may later do , I direct that at the close of the luncheon recess counsel for the Government shall proceed with its proof . " At that he whisked off the bench , leaving defense lawyers open-mouthed but speechless . An hour and a half later he mounted the bench again and awaited the attack he knew was coming . One after another and one at a time , the five defense lawyers stood up at the counsel table , facing the high bench across the wide courtroom , and the tension rose as each in turn attacked the judge . The judge sat back in his highbacked , red-covered swivel chair , swinging around this way and that to face each one in turn . He wore a vigilant air and looked at them with grim gaze , speaking quietly but firmly , with deliberation . Judge Rebukes Sacker Mr. Isserman first accused him of " abusing his discretion . " Then Harry Sacher , whose loud-voiced arguments have brought repeated chidings from the bench but whose voice was kept low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innuendo of connivance " with the prosecution . The judge told Mr. Sacher he was becoming " positively insolent , " and was making statements for " propaganda " purposes . After what has happened in the last four weeks , the judge added , he would have been guilty of " gross dereliction of duty " if he had not ruled as he did . George W. Crockett Jr . of Detroit protested that the ruling came just when he was getting ready to submit evidence on discrimination against Negroes on juries . Then Richard Gladstein of San Francisco argued the judge 's . ruling had " changed the rules in the middle of the game " by preventing the defense from putting in the balance of its case . The judge replied he had not done this , but was simply regulating the order in which proof was to be submitted , without stopping the defense from putting in further evidence later . . An Appeal Is Threatened Mr. Gladstein insisted the judge was wrong , however , and had committed a " plain , clear reversible error . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia lawyer , told the judge defense counsel would " leave it to a higher court to eradicate some of the errors here . " " That sort of threat will have no effect on me , " the judge replied : " I 've been subject to every kind of vituperation here , but it remains to be seen whether the higher courts will reverse me . " But all this will not affect my judgment . I 'm doing my best here Ito rule justly and protect the Run . ' TRIAL WITNESS Joseph F. - rat . IV ** lar1K X , 31,1 rights of these defendants despite the conduct of their counsel . I shall continue to do that . " At this several of the lawyers jumped up and began protesting at the same time . Mr. Gladstein left the heavy oaken defense table , walked around the prosecutors , and went between the court stenographer and the witness box , close to ? the bench . Shaking his finger at the judge , Mr. Gladstein began to talk but was quickly cut short by the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge in a threatening way . I do n't know what you mean by it . " Mr. Gladstein withdrew toward the counsel table . Then he stopped and asked the judge what he meant . " I meant you walked right up near the bench and shook your finger at me , " said the judge . " I 'm not going to stand for it . " Mr. Gladstein said he wanted the record to show he had made no " threatening gesture , " and sat down . Then theajudge directed the prosecution to proceed with ? its case , and the tension relaxed . Frank H. Gordon , special assistant to the Attorney General , called Mr. , the jury clerk for this Federal district . Defense counsel protested in vain on the ground that it had had this witness under subpoena , though it had not called him . Mr. testified he has been interviewing prospective jurors on their qualifications since 1940 , except for two years while he was in the armed forces . " In qualifying prospective jurors have you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gordon asked . " No , never ! " said the witness . " Color ? " " No , definitely not . " " Creed ? " " No " " Sex ? " " No ? " Political belief ? " " Economic or social position ? " " No . " " Did you ever qualify anyone because of any of these reasons ? " " Not , definitely not . " The witness said only 15 to 20 per cent qualified as jurors , and that of these from 80 to 90 per cent were persons whose names had been selected from the list of registered voters . In addition , he said , he had used at times a special telephone book arranged by addresses , Poor 's " Directory of Directors , " " The Engineers ' Directory , " various college alumni lists , and recommendations of the Federal Grand Jury Association , judges and others . ? Professor Wilkerson on re-direct examination by defense counsel , insisted that errors in his testimony pointed out by the prosecution on cross-examination had amounted to only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listings . These dealt with jurors alleged to have been " repeaters , " serving time and again . On final cross-examination , however , United States Attorney John F. X. made the witness count these " repeat " listings and admit the total was only 320.
