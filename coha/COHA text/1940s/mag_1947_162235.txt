Last summer , in an across-the-border display of short tempers ( TIME , Aug.11 , 25 ) , Canadian railroads were accused of sticky slowness in returning empty U.S.-owned coal cars . Last week the shoe was on the other foot . At the season when Canada 's need of boxcars was greatest-to move the grain harvest from prairie to port-U.S. railroads were far behind in their return of closed cars . <P> Told about it , crotchety old Colonel J. Monroe ( " Steamboat " ) Johnson , head of the U.S. Office of Defense Transportation and a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission , went into action . Result : the I.C.C . ordered U.S. railroads , which had 12,177 more Canadian boxcars than Canada had of theirs , to get 5,000 of them off U.S. tracks promptly , even if empty .
