The Devil <P> Sirs : <P> ... I wish to give an Atheist 's answer to the point of view presented by Msgr . Sheen in ... his broadcast TIME , Feb. 3 . <P> The claim made by the gentleman is that Liberalism is dying , allegedly because such Liberalism requires a moral basis which it is unable to create or maintain . This is absolutely false . The ideas of goodness in the broader sense are not the exclusive property of , or even result of , religion . The basic ideas of decent and cooperative behavior are but the inevitable product of intelligent people who wish to live together in harmony . <P> ... In an unreligious society there is no cessation of judgment as to what is right and what is wrong . Such judgments are made , however , not out of fear of some mysterious supernatural unknown , but for the sake of the right action itself . . . . <P> FRED KUEHNDORF JR . <P> Scarsdale , N.Y . <P> Sirs : <P> Historical Liberalism dying ! Rather , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for membership in a community that will give him " enlargement of purpose " which nearly 2,000 years of historical Catholicism has been unable to satisfy . <P> To decry as " the ape of God " all those who do not hew to the party.line is ecclesiastical dictatorship at its apogee . . . . <P> RUTH M CRAIG <P> Erie , Pa . <P> Sirs : <P> What Msgr . Sheen is describing is not the dawn of the religious phase of human history , but a retrogression to the era of the persecuting bigot and the inquisitor . . . . <P> JOSEPH V.THOMAS <P> Columbus , Ohio <P> Sirs : <P> As a Unitarian ... I take personal offense . . . . <P> The liberal religion of humanitarians has given to the world the great works of such men &; women as Horace Mann , Susan B. Anthony , Julia Ward Howe , Thomas Jefferson , Peter Cooper . . . . <P> Just look around you , Msgr . Sheen , at some of your Catholic countries-Mexico , Italy , Spain , Portugal , Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghettos , persecution and the Roman Catholic Church rule . . . . <P> <P> JEAN H. MASSIMO <P> New York City <P> Sirs : <P> After careful consideration of the excerpts from Msgr . Sheen 's address , I have come to the conclusion that I am the Devil . What do I do now ? <P> CRANE C. HAUSER <P> Chicago <P> Ans . <P> Sirs : <P> Now that we have all enjoyed guessing , are you going to tell us or do we have to wait for your quarterly quiz ? The question is , did Marshall tell Chiang of his new appointment TIME , Jan. 20 , p. 21 , or was Ambassador Stuart the only one who knew it p. 34 ? <P> <P> BART NELSON <P> Stockton , Calif . <P> <P> I The shamefaced answer : TIME was wrong on p. 21 , right on p.34. - ED . <P> Flatbush Exception Sirs : <P> Just beyond the outskirts of the Brooklyn community known as Flatbush-but geographically in a section called Crown Heights - there happen to be a few acres of ground called Ebbets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what goes on there . But there is a widespread impression that not only Flatbush but all of Brooklyn is merely an extension of that ball park . TIME is one of the worst offenders in disseminating that humiliating propaganda .
