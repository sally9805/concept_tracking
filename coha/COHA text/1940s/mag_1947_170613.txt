Leon Clausen , president of J. I. Case Co. ( farm machinery ) , is a rugged individualist . The Secretary of Agriculture , the Secretary of Labor , the NLRB , the regional WLB and the Mayor of Racine had all failed to break down his stubbornness . But Clausen had his own views on how to settle the strike of 3,500 U.A.W. workers at his company 's Racine ( Wis. ) plant . His solution , as reported by a committee of machinery-starved farmers : " When these men have been out long enough and their families get hungry enough , the strike will end . " <P> Last week , after 14 months , the strikers ' families were hungry enough . They accepted the 25-an-hour wage increase offered by the company five months ago , abandoned the fight to get a closed shop , compulsory checkoff , or maintenance of membership . <P> The nation 's fourth oldest strike had ended , with an estimated cost to workers of $11,744,000 in lost wages . Leon Clausen , who with federal tax refunds could show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had given the union an unmerciful drubbing . <P> * The Labor Department lists three older strikes : California redwood workers ( September 1945 ) ; textile workers at the Gaffney Mfg . Co. , Gaffney , S. C. ( September 1945 ) ; seven railroad unions at the Toledo , Peoria &; Western Railroad ( October 1945 ) .
