A full-dress patriotic campaign to keep farmers from'planting even the legal acreage of wheat was launched last week by Secretary of Agriculture Claude Wickard . He was too tactful to say that war has turned the 55,000,000-acre minimum allotment fixed by law into a white elephant ( TIME , June 22 ) , but what he did say was nonetheless plain English . <P> " In order to make his best contribution , " said he , " every farmer should divert as much wheat land as practicable to crops more urgently needed . . . soybeans , flax and various feed crops . " He told them that storing the colossal wheat surplus ( tying up , among other things , thousands of bins made of precious steel ) is already a terrible headache . He begged them to keep all the wheat they could on the farm and to market as much more as possible in the form of livestock and poultry . <P> During the next few months before all U.S. winter wheat gets planted , Mr. Wickard 's plea will be supplemented by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county agents to wheat planters . By fall the campaign may also be supported by some good , hard cash in the form of incentive prices ( still undetermined ) for crops like soybeans and flax that are sorely needed . <P> Wickard hopes his appeal to the farmers ' patriotism may cut wheat planting by 15,000,000 acres . But the profit motive is working hard against him . The farm bloc has fixed the crop-loan law so that farmers can unload their wheat on the Government at $1.14 a bushel v. 98 last year and 65 the year before . <P> To U.S. farmers , that ai n't hay .
