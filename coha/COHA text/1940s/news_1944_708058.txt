txt Within a short time another world capital will begin to emerge from the fog and night of war . London has been under fire since 3940 . Her people knew the terror of bombs dropped night after night and week after week from hostile planes . Recently they have endured the even greater terror of the robot bomb , which might arrive at my moment , hurling its victims , as they slept or walked the streets or chatted with their neighbors , into eternity . In these risks there seems to have been , for many temperaments , a kind of exhilaration . Very ordinary persons , not considering themselves heroic , doing humdrum kinds of work , rarely finding words for lofty thoughts , discovered that they could conquer fear . London , as Home Security Minister Herbert Morrison said yesterday , did n't " squeal . " It took the worst the Nazis could dish out , and no processions went to Downing Street to ask Mr. Churchill to please stop the war . And London 's glory was shared by Coventry , Plymouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The worst of the ordeal was not in the danger of death or mutilation . It was in the enforced darkness . " The lamps are going out all over Europe , " said Lord Grey , on the evening after Britain entered the First World War ; " we shall not see them lit again in our lifetimes . " Indeed , they flickered for twenty-five years after Armistice Day , and then went out . again . Blackness hid the old cheerful glow of welcoming windows . Pedestrians groped their awkward way in medieval gloom . When light came , it came in the flames of burning buildings and the fierce glitter of incendiaries . It meant ruin and death . But the British  --  who are sometimes presented to us as a cold , calculating people , avoiding needless risk and letting others carry their burdens ? stuck it out . They buried their dead , took their wounded to hospitals , and went about their work in a night that was lit by stubborn faith but for a long time by no well-founded hope . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aristocratic pomp and circumstance was torn , the royal family and the heads of Government shared with costermongers and dock-workers the common danger , and the democratic reality stood firm amid the wreckage . Mr. Morrison now announces that Britain 's blackout regulations will be relaxed on Sept. 17 . London itself may have to wait a little longer than the rest of the country . The glow of lamps behind ordinary window-shades will be permitted . There will be almost normal lights in the streets and on vehicles . Civilian defense is to be placed on a " stand-easy " basis , with its full-time workers released and its part-time volunteers cut from forty-eight hours ' - duty to twelve hours ' duty a month . So ends the siege of London and the siege of Britain . Robots or some new terrific weapons may still be hurled at the island . But the thunder and the lightning are drawing away now to the quarter from which they came . They are over Germany now . The lights of London will shine again under a clearing sky .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
