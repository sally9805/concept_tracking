txt The Indian disturbances , which were reaching a climax yesterday , were not so serious in the military sense as the famous mutiny of 1857 . The Labor Prime Minister , Mr. Attlee , has declared that " order must be restored , " and it doubtless will be . Mobs can not stand against the machine guns , artillery and even planes that a Government can bring to bear on them today . The naval mutineers were in much the same position . But a Government dedicated to freedom and justice , as Mr. Attlee 's Government avowedly is , wins no victory merely by restoring order . It must find and , if possible , remove the causes of disorder . Mr. Attlee 's personal and public record , including this week 's decision to send a commission of Cabinet rank to India , is proof enough that this is what he wants to do . The Indian problem often seems to be one of reconciling the political differences between the Hindus and the Moslems . Another element was evident this week  --  a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including American soldiers . The Japanese did their best to stimulate this emotion , and it is strong enough to stir up popular sentiment in favor of Indians who fought on the Japanese side and whom the British are now trying to punish . The Japanese version of a " Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere " may not have pleased the Indian people , but " Asia for the Asiatics " has a ring that appeals to many of them . Throughout the world the colored races who live under , white domination are seeing what is for them a new light . Students in Chungking stage a demonstration against Russian occupation of Manchuria ? an ironic episode because the Russians profess to be defenders of the colored races against the Western exploiters . Shanghai is upset by strikes , probably with a political undercurrent . The Indonesians balk at the terms offered them by the Netherlands Government , and an uprising is reported on the heretofore peaceful island of Celebes . Rioters in Cairo and other cities in the Nile Valley demand that the British take their soldiers out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep sea of discontent that may represent half the human race . The grave differences between Russia and her recent partners in war do not make it any easier to deal with this situation . We may be certain , however , that the imperialism of the white race over the colored races is passing . One may argue that this imperialism had its good points . It brought Western civilization to the Orient , introducing new ideas along with new goods . Today 's revolts are the result of Western conceptions implanted in what had been hopelessly stagnant populations . The Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights are doing their effective work , and the mos ' that an American can hope is that they will win out over Karl Marx . These revolts are not a pretty sight . In some of them there is senseless cruelty . Tempers rise on both sides , and the process of restoring order will leave painful scars . But ' it is evident that out of it all there will come a new dispensation The formerly subject races are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that they must accept this new maturity . The United States has set a pattern in the Philippines that points toward a fairer and more peaceful future .
