During the current shakeout of the U.S. economy , worried businessmen have anxiously waited for first-quarter earnings ; they would be the Scoreboard that would show how well-or how badly-business was batting . Last week , as the first big batch of earnings came out , the scoreboard looked almost as cheerful as a home run in a tight game with the bases loaded . So far , at least , business was batting well : the slump had not been bad . <P> In fact , for a good half of the 175-odd companies which had reported by early this week , there had been no recession ; they turned in earnings that were even higher than in 1948 's fat first quarter . A notable example was Republic Steel , first of the big steel companies to report . It had a 60% jump in its net profit , from $9.1 million to $15.2 million . Another example was General Electric Co . Despite a slump in the sale of appliances and an industrywide wave of price-cutting , G.E . boosted its first-quarter net to $26.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of this , G.E . had no intention of pulling in its horns . To show stockholders at the annual meeting in Schenectady how the company was expanding , President Charles E. Wilson took them on a tour through G.E . ' s new $30 million turbine plant , the world 's biggest , showed off some of the products . <P> G.E . ' s competitors had not done so well . Westinghouse 's net dropped $2.2 million to $10,866,921 . Apex Electrical Mfg . Co. slipped from a $493,836 net into a $381,261 deficit , and other appliance makers felt that the worst was still to come . <P> Pleasant Thoughts . International Business Machines Corp . ' s spry old President Thomas J. Watson , whose favorite motto is " Think ! " , gave his stockholders something pleasant to think about : a 16% gain in profits , to $7.8 million . Caterpillar Tractor Co. , cashing in on long-deferred roadbuilding , bulldozed its own net from $2.9 million to $4.7 million-a gain of 63.9% . <P> Among the food companies , Corn Products Refining Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But General Foods probably gave a better indication of the general trend . Its gross was up slightly to $127,802,860 , but rising costs cut its net from $8,155,176 to $7,593,797 . Even the airline and aircraft industries , which had long been ailing , were perking up . Prime example : Douglas Aircraft Co. , which had earned only $23,862 in 1948 's first quarter , this year earned $2 million , the result of rearmament contracts and a cost-cutting campaign . American Airlines , which lost $4.2 million in the 1948 quarter , cut its loss to $222,521 . <P> Though the housing boom was past its peak , the building industry showed some outstanding performers . Johns-Manville Corp . boosted its net 24.9% ( from $2.3 million to $2.8 ) , Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Co. 23.4% ( from $3.1 million to $3.8 ) , and Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. 17% . Small Pennsylvania-Dixie Cement Corp . showed a 171% rise ( to $325,410 ) .
