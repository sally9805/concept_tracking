Fishbowl v. Pickle Jar <P> Sirs : <P> Can it be that the historic jar rushed from Philadelphia 's Independence Hall to Washington with so much ceremony for the draft lottery was not the one used in 1917 ? In History of the World War by Frank H. Simonds , Vol . IV , p. 41 , there is a photograph entitled " Drawing the First Number " purporting to show Secretary of War Baker pulling out the first of 10,500 capsules . However , the jar is definitely not the one illustrated in TIME , Nov. 11 . Mr. Baker 's 1917 jar is shaped like a fishbowl and has a small mouth whereas the jar shown in TIME looks like a large glass wastebasket . <P> Can you throw any light on this mixup ? <P> JOHN QUENTIN RODGERS <P> Lumberville , Pa . <P> &gt; TIME did not err ; the picture in Simonds ' history is miscaptioned . The bowl pictured in TIME , resembling a pickle jar , which was used for the 1940 drawing , was the one used for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. Baker taking out the first number , but they were not good . By the time of the second drawing in June , 1918 , the pickle jar had already been installed in Philadelphia 's Independence Hall . So for the second drawing a fishbowl was obtained and used , and Secretary Baker was again first to put in his hand . Pictures of this second drawing were so good that they leaked into history books with captions indicating it was the first. - ED . <P> Bombs on London <P> Sirs : <P> The bombing of London irritates me less than TIME 'S article on the Battle of Britain ( Sept. 23 ) . You say : " . . . Busses stopped . . . cabbies ducked . " This is sheer nonsense for I have ridden many times in both busses and taxis during a raid . <P> At the beginning of the Luftwaffe the decision on stopping busses in a raid was left to the judgment of the individual drivers . Few stopped . Today none stop until a street " spotter " gives the signal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both to petrol rationing and raids , but I 've always been able to get one . On Oct. 4 , I taxied from Blackfriars to Harley Street during a raid . Suddenly the guns went into action overhead . My driver turned to me and said : " Madam , the raiders are overhead , would you care to take cover ? " " Not unless you want to , " I replied . He withered me with a look and drove on . This is the rule , not the exception . <P> You do London a grave disservice with such misrepresentation of facts . . . . You suggest that Londoners are living on the last spurt of energy which so often galvanizes a dying man . This is untrue and unworthy of TIME . <P> ELIZABETH BURTON London <P> &gt;TIME 'S account described the first week of mass daylight raids in mid-September , when Londoners ' reactions showed they were not yet bomb-hardened . They did undoubtedly harden , and they naturally grew cockier when mass daylight raids stopped after the British defense had rung up high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the frank recital below of a man whose home was hit. - ED . <P> Sirs : <P> Attached is an extract from a letter I received lately from England . . . <P> W. ALVIN SCHAFFNER <P> New York City <P> Oct. 28 Dear Al ,
