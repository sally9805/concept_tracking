Mendelssohn : Elijah ( Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra , Huddersfield Choral Society , Sir Malcolm Sargent conducting ; with Isobel Baillie , soprano , Gladys Ripley , contralto , James Johnston , tenor , Harold Williams , bass-baritone ; Columbia , 32 sides ) . It was Mendelssohn who revived Bach 's great St. Matthew Passion 100 years after it was written . Now , 100 years after Mendelssohn 's death , his own choral masterpiece , a work of simplicity and directness , gets an excellent performance on records . Recording : good . <P> Mozart : Quintet in D Major for Strings , K. 593 ( Milton Katims , violist , with the Budapest String Quartet ; Columbia , 6 sides ) . Somber but superb Mozart , superbly played . Recording : fair . <P> Beethoven : Concerto in D Major ( Josef Szigeti , violinist , with the New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra , Bruno Walter conducting ; Columbia , 10 sides ) . The second time Szigeti and Walter have teamed up in Beethoven 's only violin concerto , again with happy results . Recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 and 9 , Op. 59 ( Paganini Quartet ; Victor , 3 volumes , 26 sides ) . The new Paganiril Quartet plays the three famed " Rasoumowsky " quartets with competence but without fire . The first one has been done better by the Roth Quartet , and the other two by the Budapest . Recording : good . <P> Berlioz : Romeo &; Juliet Excerpts ( NBC Symphony Orchestra , Arturo Toscanini conducting ; Victor , 6 sides ) . Berlioz ' Romeo &; Juliet is the kind of music that in lesser hands can sound merely bombastic ; Toscanini gives it the care and excitement it deserves . Recording ( on Vinylite ) : excellent . <P> Franck : Symphonic Variations ( Eileen Joyce , pianist , with 1'Orchestre de la Socit des Concerts du Conservatoire de Paris , Charles Mnch conducting ; Decca Record Co . Ltd. , 4 sides ) . Few could excel Walter Gieseking 's fine performance of this popular work ; Miss Joyce did n't . Recording : good . <P> Stravinsky : Dumbarton Oaks Concerto ( Dumbarton Oaks Festival Orchestra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pleasant latter-day Stravinsky , but baked in only the embers of the once-powerful fire that produced Petrouchka and The Firebird . Recording : good . <P> Operatic Duets ( Jan Peerce , tenor , Leonard Warren , baritone , with the RCA-Victor Orchestra , Jean Paul Morel and Erich Leinsdorf conducting ; Victor , 4 sides ) . Peerce and Warren too often sing vocal duels instead of duets . The album includes Solenne in Quest ' Ora from Verdi 's La Forza del Destino and Ah , Mimi , Tu Pi from Puccini 's La Bohme . Recording : good .
