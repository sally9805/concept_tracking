txt Patents and Communications Referring to your editorial entitled " Patents in Wartime , " of May 1 , you will be interested to know that the Treasury Department has recently announced that it will not license communication with an enemy national outside the United States in connection with patents , trademarks and copyright , except under very unusual circumstances , such as when the transaction would further the war effort . This is tantamount to completely cutting off all communication with enemy and enemy occupied countries , as it calls for a showing which is practically impossible to make . You will also be interested to know that the British Government has just taken similar steps , in that the general license which permitted British nationals to communicate with enemy nations In respect of patents and trademarks has been canceled . LAWRENCE LANGNER . New York , May 4 , 1942.
