Osteopath Charles T. Markert of Ridgefield Park , N. J. was a good friend of Mr. Walter Freiwald , an accountant in nearby Bogota . So when Mr. Freiwald 's 22-year-old son Walter Jr . came home from Plattsburg military training camp last July with infected tonsils . Osteopath Markert , himself only 25 , offered to spare the family the expense of a hospital and surgeon . He invited his boyhood friend and schoolmate , Osteopath Thomas O. Maxfield , 27 , of Maplewood , to come to his office and remove Walter 's tonsils . <P> Under New Jersey law , Markert was not allowed to prescribe drugs , administer anesthetics , or use the knife in surgical operations . But Maxfield was a newly qualified " licensed medical practitioner " - a kind of super-osteopath who had passed a special State examination allowing him " unlimited practice . " <P> At 7:30 one morning last week , Walter , a junior in Rutgers University , went to Markert 's office with his father . Mr. Freiwald waited while the two osteopaths placed Walter on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law by acting as Maxfield 's assistant , gave the boy ether . Maxfield then began to snip out the right tonsil , he said . <P> Suddenly they noticed that young Freiwald 's pulse was slowing down . Frantically the two men applied artificial respiration , but to no avail . At 10:04 they called the police for oxygen tanks and a Pulmotor . In six minutes the police arrived . For two hours they worked over the boy , until the county physician pronounced him dead . The osteopaths insisted on continuing resuscitation until finally , a little after 3 o'clock , they gave up . Walter Freiwald had died from too much ether in his lungs and brain . <P> Markert was promptly arrested , charged with manslaughter , held on $990 bail . Maxfield was photographed , fingerprinted and released . He had not transgressed the law . Said Walter 's bereaved mother to reporters : " We had all the confidence in the world in him .
