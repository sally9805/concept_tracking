The New River , which flows some 250 mountainous miles from southwestern Virginia in a hook northwest into West Virginia , * is a thoroughly old-fashioned stream . The New is unimproved , except for traces of a small Congressional appropriation a half-century ago ; like all unimproved streams it alternately races and moseys , brawls and dawdles . Fifteen years ago Appalachian Electric Power Co. decided to throw a dam across the New , five miles above the little town of Radford , Va . ( pop . 6,898 ) . The Federal Power Commission demanded that Appalachian accept a license to dam the stream for a power plant . Under the Federal Water Power Act of 1920 , no navigable stream ( or non-navigable stream affecting interstate commerce ) may thus be obstructed without Government permission , and Commission licenses contain an acquisition clause whereby such projects may be bought by the Federal Government in 50 years . <P> Appalachian Electric Power Co. resisted the demand in court on grounds that the New River was not navigable . ( The historically accepted Supreme Court conception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law as one which is navigable in fact . ) The New had not been used for water commerce since the ' 90 's ; a great part of it was as unnavigable as a river can be : rocky , swift , extremely shallow . <P> The case flickered feebly until mid-1934 , when Appalachian began actual construction of its unlicensed dam . In August 1939 a 1,140-foot barrier of grey-white concrete stretched across the New , with nine big spillways near the middle . Thirtieth largest hydroelectric plant in the U. S. , Claytor Dam backed up 206,000 acres of water into a lake reaching 21 miles upriver . <P> Last week as the whine of Claytor Dam 's four 2,600-h.p. generators rose over the quiet Virginia hills , the U. S. Supreme Court finally got around to the New River case . Two lower courts had agreed with the power company that it needed no license for its dam , since the New was unnavigable in fact and thus in law . By a 6-2 decision* stated by Justice Stanley Reed , the Court reversed these previous findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was subject to license and regulation . <P> Clipped by this decision were the wings of more than two score legal eagles , for 41 State Attorney Generals had filed briefs on the company side . And the Court set up a new definition of navigability , to wit : 1 ) any stream navigable by boats drawing two feet or more is " navigable " ; 2 ) any stream that can be improved into navigability by expenditure of any " reasonable " amount of money is " navigable . " The court further held that the authority of the Government over any navigable stream " is as broad as the needs of commerce " -a definition which broadened the commerce clause of the Constitution almost immeasurably . Justices Owen Roberts and James C. McReynolds dissented vigorously , holding that " . . . then every creek in every State of the Union which has enough water ... to float a boat drawing two feet of water may be pronounced navigable . . . . Congress can create navigability by determining to improve a non-navigable stream . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
