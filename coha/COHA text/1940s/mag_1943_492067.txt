We Bomb the U-Boat Pens By LT . ARTHUR GORDON 8th AIR FORCE A BOMBER BANE IN ENGLAND , by Cable . I F YOU were a German infantryman crouching behind the barbed wire that guards the Brittany coast , you would 14,0k up and see the tiny formation etched against the wintry sky and say grimly , " Look , the Americans are after the U-boat pens at St. Nazaire again . " Americans  --  ten of them in each Fortress  --  the kind of boys you used to know , barefooted in summer on the farm . grease-stained under some car in a corner garage . Suppose you were up there . Which gun would you like to man ? Which sent would you prefer to fill ? The pilot 's of course . He is the leader , the man in command . He makes the final decisions ; he is the oldest , the wisest , the steadiest  --  or should be . All right , you are the pilot . Your name is Robert C. Williams , captain , U. S. Army Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . Ask anyone . In Flint , Michigan , chances are they 'll remember how you used to sing in church choirs there ; used to go to the University of Michigan Law School , until ? This is not a big guy , five feet eight maybe , but solid , with steady hands and intelligent , rather tired blue eyes , one a little bloodshot right now , and a reddish mustache . A guy who likes group singing more than anything else , piloting a bomber with the lives of ten men and four radial engines resting on your shoulders . This is your first combat mission . Normally , you are squadron operations officer . Normally , you do n't go on sorties . But today your roommate was sick , so you borrowed his plane and crew . It 's a little like borrowing a valuable set of books  --  you want to return them intact , and the sooner the better . So far , everything is right  --  too right . The briefing was clear , comprehensive . The take-off was perfect  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sullen earth into the empty sky . Good weather so far ; guns tested and okay ; engines okay . Over France now and no sight of enemy pursuits . No flak . Where are Goering 's yellow-nosed Abbeville kids ? Where is the flak ? Things are too quiet , too easy . You are on the left wing of the squadron leader . There he sits , not thirty yards away . Beautiful thing , a Flying Fortress . If there were only more of them ! The sunlight picks out the camouflage on the wings , and under the glistening belly the ball turret turns slowly , the gunner inside looking like an embryo chick in a glass egg . In the transparent nose , the bombardier kneels before his bombsight like en acolyte before an altar . You can see the livid yellow of his inflatable life jacket , the dark green of his oxygen mask . The interphone crackles in your ear : " Bombardier to combat crew , Altitude is twenty-two thousand feet  --  two-two thousand feet . Check oxygen supply . " You turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone begins to sing Deep in the Heart of Texas , more a metallic croak than a song . Still , it will get some laughs and reduce the tension . Where are those .. pursuitri ? Where is the flak ? Things are too quiet . The formation drones on , the roar of the engines muted by the altitude . The flanking ships have their . props close behind the trailing edge of the lead bomber 's wing . as if from their proximity they gain strength and confidence . The rubber diaphragms of the oxygen masks expand and contract like living lungs . Outside , the sun is bright , but the temperature is fifteen below zero . Frost begins to form on the transparent nose , and the bombardier opens a panel to let the icy air stream through , clearing the glass . A thousand feet below , a tiny , circular rainbow with the shadows of three planes in it races across the clouds . A goad omen , maybe . Almost across the peninsula now . Down below on enemy airdromes there must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversionary flights ? Do they know the target is the concrete sub pens at St. Nazaire ? Yes , now they know . Near the target the flak comes up , menacing puffs of brown , oily smoke mushrooming across the sky . But it is n't bad . Low and to the left . Not bad at all  --  not like the time the group went over at 8000 feet . Evasive action now , to fool the gunners down below . Flak can be tough . It can be terrifying , mainly because you ca n't see it coming up  --  just big . ugly puffs spreading closer and closer through the empty sky . But today it 's light . It should be easy to give the bombardier the brief seconds of steady flying he needs . The bombardier is waiting on his knees , his eye glued to the soft rubber eyepiece . This is his moment . This is everybody 's moment . To these fleeting ticks of a watch the whole mission , the whole elaborate preparation , is dedicated . To hit the target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That is desirable , but secondary . A good man , this bombardier , Emmett Ford by name . Tall and rawboned , with green eyes and crinkly hair . From Siloam Springs . Arkansas . Big and a little sleepy and easygoing . He likes his job , its importance and exact skill . Likes it , too , because he has a machine gun to shoot after his bombs are loosed . He con fight back when he has to , The pilots have to sit there and take it . He has made his calculations . Now the bomb-bay doors yawn open ; his finger is on the little lever that releases the load of death . He talks fast , his lips barely moving , the sensitive disks strapped to his throat carrying his instructions to the pilot . Under his straining eye , the cross hairs bisect a certain infinitesimal point miles below . He touches the shiny little lever . The bombs are away  --  the bombs are away , and they will strike home and maybe one U-boat laee will stalk the African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never enough . This is a pin prick . When do we start breaking their becks ? What the bombs may do when they strike dove not concern the bombardier personally . Most of the things that concern him personally are 4000 miles away . The girl from Kansa. % for instance , that he Dopes to marry someday . Frankie , her name is . Frenkie , who does not drink , but likes fun and dancing . Funny . the way ho met her . He left home at nineteen to roughneck as an oil driller . He has a happy home . with a good mother and a father who was justice of the peace . There was a lot of peace in Siloam Springs . And four brothers and four sisters . Hut he left it because he liked to move , liked to meet new people . So he moved and he met people . He was the derrick man on a drilling crew that wildcatted all over the oil country . Five men in that crew , as closely knit and interdependent as any aerial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly on clothes and saran new car every year . Sornetimee they 'd drill sixty days , sometimes four or five months , Sometimes the well would come in. sometimes not . A rough life and a good one . And then one night at a Bohemian dance in Lyons , Kansas . he met Frankie , small , dark-haired , more attractive than pretty . He was wearing his working clothes . He was pretty grimy ; really , but she did n't seem to care . Then the attack on Pearl Harbor . and Emmett Ford enlisted the next day . One man on this plane will not come back alive from today 's raid , but do n't worry . Frankie  --  that man is not your lieutenant . Peet the target now and heading for home . Lasing altitude . Hoping to hedge-hop across the peninsula . Down to 18,000 feet . . down to 10,000 . Captain Williams has turned over the controls to the copilot . Everyone is feeling better . Wail a minute ! What 's this ? Over there on the left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hey , it 's a Focke-Wulf 190 ! Luok at him waggle his wings , trying to pretend he 's n Spit . Give him a couple of bursts .. navigator . Show him we know who he is . The navigator charges his gun , slides the safety catch to the right . His forefingers squeeze the twin triggers . The red tracers streak angrily away . He 's too far away . Never mind , he 'll conic closer when his friends have joined him . A nice-looking kid , this navigator . Small , compact , with brown eyes and skin , a straight nose and neatly parted heir . Jacob Chester Shively , of Fayetteville , Pennsylvania , - Jake " to the rest of the crew . Grew up on his father 's farm with four brothers and two sisters . Pretty place , that farm . All the buildings painted white and trimmed with green . set in the rolling blue of Franklin County not fur from Gettysburg , where they also fought a bottle once . Remember ? Maybe 700 people live in Fayetteville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // of churches . Jake 's parents were steady churchgoers  --  United Brethren . He went to Sunday school regularly , hunted rabbits and pheasants ; fished for bass and suckers with his brother ; stayed out late , so they missed supper . Got paddled w hen they got home . Once that same brother , flying for the Navy now , chopped the end of Jake 's finger off with a corn-shucking knife . The sight of blood scared them both half to death , but Jake was n't badly hurt . He 'll see more of his own blood today , but he wo n't be badly hurt this time either . The Focke-Wulf on the left disappears . The formation of Fortresses roars on . There is something majestic about that formation . There is security in its united power . But let one bomber lose its place . let it be shot out of formation for even a minute , and the squadron 's deadly combined fire power is impaired . Then suddenly over the interphone comes the warning , " Here they come ! Seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock , the tail is six . Out of t he sun dive four Focke-Wulfs , one after the other . They are plenty brave , those German fliers , and they can shoot . Their ' 20-mm. cannon shells , fused to burst at HOO yards unless they strike something first , begin to explode in the thin blue air behind the bomber 's towering tail fin . They move closer cannon shell hits a plane , the way it sounds depends on where you are . If you 're not too close , it 's a kind of metallic whoof , like a small bark from a big dog , and you feel a jar that shakes the whole ship . But if it 's right beside you , it sounds like some giant slamming his cupped hand down on the surface of still water  --  a double sound really , the first from the impact and the second when the shell explodes , ka-plonk , like that . Like firing a shotgun into a rain barrel . And your stomach shrivels up until you know how much damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator two feet from the tail gunner . The nose of the Fortress leaps as the tail is slapped down . She loses speed and drops back somewhat from formation . It takes a strong man to force the stick forward and bring her back to an even keel . The copilot is very strong . He is Warren George , Jr. , of Palestine , Texas . Do n't forget the Junior  --  everyone calls him that . Thick crowbar wrists and a round , good-natured face dubiously ornamented with a very new mustache . Plenty of beef around the shoulders and a little under the chin . A strong boy , to make a concert pianist out of him once , but he was secretly delighted when he broke his hand . He can still play some boogie-woogie though . Now he wrestles the wounded bomber back to a horizontal flying position and just as he does  --  whoof  --  they hit the other elevator . They really wreck that elevator . They hit the port wing . They damage the rudder controls . ' The tail drops again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet against the control post and shoves forward with all his might . He can see the post bend under the strain . The old football muscles under his thighs bulge with it . Slowly the nose comes down . But now they are behind their formation , and are a juicy isolated target . The F-W 's come whooping in , their guns winking spiteful little tongues of flame . Waist Gunner Neeley to pilot , " Houston is hit , sir ! " Radioman Espitallier to pilot , " Radio room on fire ! " Top-turret Gunner Aulenbach to combat crew , " Here they come again ! Shoot the ? " Slowly , now , or it will he impossible to follow all this . Nobody can follow it really . Too much happens too quickly , with too explosive violence . They wondered if it could happen to them , and then they thought it would n't , and now it is happening . In five minutes or five seconds they may be dead , or maimed , or floating down over the hostile fields of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no time for thinking . There is time only for acting . Waist Gunner Neeley . Who is he ? Colin Neeley , of Columbia , South Carolina , an old hand and a Regular Army man , with service in Panama . Closemouthed and dependable and tough as an old hunting boot . No nerves at all . A leonine head with tawny , rather ruthless eyes  --  a hunter 's eyes . Once , on a former mission , the tail gunner 's twin guns jammed and he called on Neeley for help . Neeley twisted his own gun and calmly picked off the F-W as it closed in . A dead shot with any kind of a gun . Already one of his bursts has sent an enemy pursuit reeling away , damaged , if not destroyed . But now a cannon shell slices through the fuselage . It burets and Neeley feels the fragments sting his legs . He sees the other waist gunner go down . Surprisingly , Neeley keeps a diary of his combat missions . Look back a few weeks and you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have two waist gunners and said we could pick any man in the squadron who satisfied us . I am taking Sergeant Houston , a mechanic on our ground crew , as he seems to be a good man , and think he will make a good gunner . I am going to bed early , as I 'll probably need a lot of extra energy tomorrow . " /Confirmed From Pap 591 mouth . A great talker and a lucky guy . Already cannon shells have burst Like gigantic paper bags an each aide of him . Turning around and looking forward , he can see a hole in the port wing that looks as wide as a barrel . But he 19 still intact , and so are his guns . A thousand yards away , an F-W climbs lazily , hangs in the air and shakes its wings like an old hen getting up out of the sand . Then suddenly it comes boring in close , closer . Willie Williams pours his tracers into it . He sees them enter the propeller arc , glance off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls over , slips gently down and bursts into flames . A confirmed kill for Sergeant Williams . Maybe he learned the knack in his boyhood on those cold gray mornings when he used to crunch among cornstalks white with frost , waiting for the doves to come in . Or maybe something his parents taught him had more to do with it  --  fear of God and nothing else in the world . Whatever it was , this is the same boy who used to go to school every day with his mother , who taught and still teaches the first grade . The boy who liked fishing and hunting and roller skating , and baseball on Thursday afternoons , and the old-fashioned square dances afterward at the women 's club . This is the boy who used to take a girl , now and then , to the movies at the Fay Theater down on Main Street , and who likes one blond girl better than the rest . This is Willie Williams , who went to CCC camp because it seemed the best thing to do , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a college education . And maybe he will . Maybe he will . So now he has shot down an F-W 190 15,000 feet over France , and so he 's a hero , of course . But he 's still Willie Williams , of Jasper , Florida  --  and that 's why we 're going to win this war , if you see what I mean , and I think you do . The fight has been going on twenty minutes now , and to Some of them it seems like two seconds and to others it seems like two years . Down in the ball turret , crouched like a squirrel in a woodpecker 's hole , Claiborne Wilson . of Holly Springs , North Carolina , is still firing his guns . There is a cannon shell hole the size of a cabbage six inches from his turret . That does n't bother him . But now a machine-gun bullet drills the No. 2 engine , cutting an oil line . Out spurts the thick yellow liquid over the wing and over the ball turret . So now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shoot . All he can do is wave his guns threateningly . So he does that . He 's the pet of the crew , really , this little chap who looks more like a Teddy bear than anything else , when he stands up in his sky-blue , electrically heated suit . His father is a tobacco farmer , and evidently a good one , since he brought up not only Claiborne but eleven other children down in the flat Carolina farm lands . They all lived in a big white farmhouse and grew their own vegetables and raised their own hogs . and went to the Baptist Church and square dances at neighbors ' houses , where the music usually consisted of a guitar or two and a violin and a banjo . It was a good life , too , but Claiborne liked mechanical things , so be became an automobile mechanic . And then came the war , and now he flies in a spot where you have to crawl out and put on your parachute before you can jump , if you have to jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the No. 2 engine goes wild and the vibration seems to be racking the ship apart , and outside on the wing , strips of torn metal are flapping and clashing like hail on a tin roof . And the Germans keep coming , and now they put a 20-mm. shell into the top turret . A direct hit , with Aulenbach inside the turret . He was a debonair sort of chap , was Kenneth Aulenbach . They called him affectionately , " The Flying Dutchman , " or sometimes " that coal farmer . " because he came from Reading , Pennsylvania . He had had a good job at home , and he was engaged to a girl back there , and he talked often of what he 'd do after the war . But he was happy flying too . They tried to ground him once  --  a good ground job . But he 'd have none of it . He was an engineer , one of the best . He bought a motorcycle and went careering around on it over the muddy English roads . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the one who got them to combat-crew meetings on time and saw that they got all messages and such . They liked him fine because he was such a good-natured guy , always ready with a grin . Kenneth Aulenbach never knew what hit him . Ford took him out of the turret  --  Ford , who hates violence . He did what he could , but it was no use , so he climbed into the turret and tried to man the guns . But I hey were useless too . Captain Williams called Ford then to take his place , while he threaded his way back through the ship to estimate the damage . And the ship was a wreck . Fifteen cannon holes at least , and sieved by machine-gun slugs . One elevator damaged , the other destroyed . Trim tabs useless , one motor out , rudder working on three cable strands . No use enumerating the rest of it , The Fort was still flying . was n't she , on the stamina the boys in the workshops at home gave to her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? Lined with strain and , ye , with rage too . This was his roommate 's ship , remember ? His roommate 's crest .. He might have given the abandon-ship order , if it had n't been for the wounded . Perhaps the other members of the crew could have wrapped their arms around the wounded and jumped , pulling first one rip cord and then the other . But everyone stuck . The worst of it is river now . The formation has fallen hack to protect them . They shut off the No. 2 engine and get rid of the vibration . They stagger over The Ditch at 2000 feet , and somehow , with two men fighting the controls , coax her eking to a friendly airfield . The tail wheel is stuck . No matter . Little Wilson jumps on it till it comes down , sn they vet her down without flaps at 130 mph. , leave her there , like a big , tired bird , for the salvage expert . There 's not too much left , even for salvage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their target . Nine came hack alive . Of the nine . three were wounded : Houston , Shively and Neeley . Already , Neeley is ready to fly again . The others are going to be all right . Unusual ? Not particularly . It has happened before . It will happen again . War breeds lire v , thousands of them . Captain Wittier a will get the D.F.C. ; the wounded will g.a . the Purple Heart . They deserve it , but do n't forget this : Heroes are people . They never stop being people . They get scared and excited and desperate , like any other people , That 's what makes their achievements remarkable . And do n't forget this , either : Men are what their parents make them . It they are cool under fire , if they are steady in the face of danger , if they sacrifice themselves for others  --  it 's because that selflessness has been bred into them from the start . Whether that selflessness has its origin in the Blue Ridge Mountains or the San Joaquin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these boys . And because they have it , you can count on them  --  you . the people who gave it to them .
