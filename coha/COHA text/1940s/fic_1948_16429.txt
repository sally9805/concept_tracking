Then , she looks at Curly . She sees his gun . She seems to sober for an instant . Fear comes into her eyes . &nbsp; GAYE ( involuntarily ) Oh . She has seen guns in the hands of these men before . Gaye looks toward Rocco 's door . Her already unsteady hands begin to tremble violently . She tries to control them . &nbsp; GAYE ( continuing ) Perhaps I 'd better go back to my room . I feel kind of faint . ( tries to get out of her chair ; her legs are shaky ; she remains seated ) Drink 's what I need . ( to Angel ) How ' bout it , you ?

Angel looks to Rocco , who shakes his head . She sees the gesture . &nbsp; GAYE ( to Rocco ) Please , darling . &nbsp; ROCCONo.  --  61  --  She shrugs as though it 's a matter of complete indifference to her . &nbsp; ROCCO ( to M'Cloud ) What you were saying .

Here 's your chance . Rocco takes an automatic pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bolt to cock the pistol . He reaches out his hand toward Curly . &nbsp; ROCCOGimme . Curly hands Rocco his pistol . Rocco throws his own pistol to M'Cloud , who catches it . &nbsp; ROCCOOkay , soldier . You can make your hopes come true . But you got to die for it . See where I 'm aiming ? Right at your belly . Go ahead . Shoot . Nora goes to M'Cloud . &nbsp; ROCCO ( to Nora ) Get away , sister . ( she remains at M'Cloud 's side ) Gaye just sits there torturing her handkerchief . Toots watches this tableau with his head tilted and a silly grin on his face . The deputy sits forward . His eyes dart back and forth from M'Cloud to Rocco . Temple is remarkably calm and relaxed . He has no doubt as to the outcome . Curly becomes extremely busy picking his teeth . &nbsp; DEPUTY ( tensely ) Shoot ! &nbsp; ROCCOAll right . You got a gun , now . Gon na use it or not ?  --  63  --  &nbsp; TEMPLEKill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mimicking ) Yeah . " Kill him , Major . " ( he laughs musically ) Go ahead .

This time Rocco joins him . &nbsp; ROCCOToots , he laughs when something 's funny , for a change . &nbsp; M'CLOUDOne Rocco more or less is n't worth dying for . He throws the gun into a chair near him . &nbsp; TEMPLELet me have that gun , Rocco . &nbsp; ROCCONo . I 'm afraid you 'd use it . ( with a laugh ) And one old man more or less ' s not worth dying for . ( to Nora ) What 's the matter , sister ? You look like somebody died was near and dear ? Her face is drained of color .

Here 's one for sale cheap .  --  64  --  Suddenly the deputy , who has been moving the gun all this time , literally dives forward to grab the gun , thrown aside by M'Cloud . He comes up with it pointing directly at Rocco . &nbsp; DEPUTY ( wildly ) All right , Rocco . All right ! Rocco wheels in his direction . The Deputy has the pistol . It 's levelled at Rocco 's middle . The blood from the deputy 's head-wound shows wet on his face . His southern drawl comes in to a high pitched voice . &nbsp; DEPUTY ( edges toward door ) Let 's us play that game now . You can stop me from going out that door . . . but you 've got to die first . If he shoots me. . . . ( meaning Toots ) you still get it . ( without looking at Curly , as he continues in that direction ) Get away from that door . &nbsp; M'CLOUDDo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face is cold , calculating . His marksman 's eyes are bleak and impersonal . The deputy feels for the doorknob . He finds it . He flings the door open . Behind him can be seen the railing of the hallway . Rocco deliberately raises his pistol , takes aim and fires ! 52 . CLOSE DEPUTY The bullet has shocked him . He fires his own pistol . The hammer falls . There is a click but no shot . From o.s. comes another shot . The bullet is like a hammer blow , driving the deputy back through the open door . His face shows dumb surprise that his pistol has failed to fire . He slides back the bolt . The pistol is empty . There are no bullets in the magazine . He falls against the balustrade behind him . The pistol slips from his grasp . He falls over the railing and  --  65  --  down the well to the floor of the lobby , is killed by the fall . Ralph appears in the lobby .

Curly rises and starts toward door . Toots remains . Rocco goes to the door . He stops and turns to Nora . &nbsp; ROCCOThat 's right , sister , the gun was n't loaded . . . but our hero did n't know it . Rocco exits , picks up gun , puts it in his pocket , and closes door behind him . Toots takes up a position at the door . He sits down and covers group with his gun .  --  66  --  54 . INT .

His mind is elsewhere . 55 . EXT . FLORIDA BAY ROWBOAT CURLY , ANGEL , DEPUTY 'S BODY NIGHT Angel is at the oars . The lashing storm makes rowing difficult . Curly is busy securing the feet of the dead deputy with rope . Occasionally a flash of lightning illuminates the scene with an effect of grisly horror . In the b.g. we can see the pier and safely tied up is Temple 's boat . Angel stops rowing . He and Curly lift the body of the deputy and drop it over the side of the boat . Riding at anchor a hundred yards or so further out in the Bay is the yacht in which Rocco came to Key Largo . Angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the pier . The sea is getting worse . The wind begins to rise even more . 56 . INT . HOTEL LOBBY RALPH AND ROCCO Ralph is mopping up the floor where the Deputy landed in his fall from the balcony . Temple 's empty wheelchair stands near the stairs . Rocco paces nervously back and forth near the telephone on the desk . Beside the telephone stands one of the oil lamps brought in by Nora . It is burning . Over scene comes the sound of voices calling from the front porch . &nbsp; INDIANS ' VOICESMr . Temple . . . . Can we come in , please . . . Let us in . . . . Rocco glances irritably toward the front door , which is locked and shuttered . His pacing is savage , impatient . He has an unlit cigar in his mouth . The phone rings . ( Two long and two short . ) He quickly snatches up the phone . &nbsp; ROCCO ( into phone ) Okay . . . . okay , okay . ( brief pause ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you started yet ?  --  69  --  &nbsp; ROCCO ( Cont. ) ( most of Ziggy 's words are indistinguishable .

Listen : I make the run from Cuba . . . risk my neck , the boat , and a hundred grand . And you do n't wan na come out in the rain . Well , listen to me ! Either you show tonight or the deal 's off .

The lights begin to flicker . Suddenly , the first blast of the hurricane strikes the hotel . The building shudders . Rocco slowly hangs up . His eyes scan the ceiling . Over scene can be heard the voices of the Indians . There is real desperation in their voices , now . &nbsp; INDIANS ' VOICESMr . Temple . . . Mr. Temple , please , sir . . . Can we come in. . . .  --  70  --  There is a sudden crash from upstairs . It is a mixture of glass and a shattering thud . There is a piercing scream from Gaye . Rocco and Ralph move out into the lobby so they can look up toward the second floor . pp. 20-46 &nbsp; pp. 71-96 57 . BALCONY OF SECOND FLOOR SHOOTING UP The door to Room 11 is flung open by a violent gust of wind . Papers , etc. come flying out . The doors to the other rooms quake and rattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doors is chilling . Gaye appears . Her expression is one of terror . She starts running down the hallway toward the stairs . She keeps right on running until she reaches the lobby . 58 . INT . ROOM 11 The two windows are blown in . The room is in disorder . The rain drives fiercely in . The electric lights continue to flicker . M'Cloud and Nora are helping Temple toward the door . Toots is slightly rattled by the hurricane . He watchfully keeps them covered with his pistol . For a change Toots is not grinning . His frightened eyes keep glancing back toward the broken-in windows and the ominous darkness beyond . He follows the others out of the room . He wrestles with the door to close it against the wind . 59 . SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR NORA , M'CLOUD , TEMPLE , TOOTS as they walk along the stairs .

( he throws Curly a key ) Curly starts up the stairs . 61 . STAIRWAY On his way up , Curly passes the others coming down . Stay with Temple , M'Cloud , Nora and Toots . When they get to the lobby , Nora and M'Cloud help Temple into his wheelchair . Again from o.s . We hear a faint sound of calling . It is muted by the wind . It is so distant that it might possibly be the wind and not voices at all . Temple thinks he hears something . &nbsp; TEMPLEListen . Nora and M'Cloud stop to listen . They hear only the shriek of the wind . &nbsp; TEMPLEI thought I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Nora starts toward the door . Toots blocks her way . &nbsp; ROCCOSome Indians came to the door . I sent ' em away . &nbsp; NORA ( quickly ) You had no right . . . . She stops her flow of words . She realizes how impotent her statement is in the face of everything being in Rocco 's control now . The storm rises again , the wind becoming more violent . &nbsp; RALPH ( blanches ) Listen to it .  --  72  --  &nbsp; NORAThe storm shutters must be closed . &nbsp; TOOTSIf they ai n't , she says , the roof might come off . &nbsp; ROCCO ( to Ralph ) Go close ' em . Ralph hesitates . He stands listening to the wind . He glances toward the stairs . 62 . STAIRWAY CURLY He comes down the stairs , carrying a black suitcase . Getting a little courage from their appearance , apparently unharmed , Ralph starts up the stairs to close the shutters . Rocco starts toward the bar . Gaye joins him and enters bar . Curly , bag in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to others ) In there , you . Nora wheels Temple into the bar . M'Cloud follows , Toots behind him . 63 . INT . BAR Curly sets the suitcase down on one of the tables . On the bar stands an oil lamp , which is lit . Gaye starts immediately for the bar . Her intention is to pour the drink she needs so badly . She gets a bottle from behind the bar . She gets a glass . She starts to pour a drink for herself . Rocco sees this action on her part . He goes to her at the bar . He watches her raise the glass to her trembling lips . Then , he slaps the glass out of her hand . By this time the others have entered the bar and have been witness to the incident .  --  73  --  &nbsp; ROCCO ( to Gaye ) Did n't I say , " No drinking ? " &nbsp; GAYE ( in the grip of the " shakes " ) Please honey . Just one . She is trying to keep her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; ROCCO ( making a spectacle of Gaye ) One thing I ca n't stand it 's a dame is drunk . What I mean , they turn my stomach . No good to themselves or anybody else . ( she realizes they are watching her . She makes a great effort to stop her hands from trembling ) She 's got the shakes , see . So she has a drink to get rid of ' em . And then that one tastes so good , she has another . First thing you know , she 's stinko again . He seems almost proud of his explanation and analysis of her condition . The more he belittles her , the less he seems affected by the violence of the storm . The more he strips her of her womanhood , the more manly he appears to become . &nbsp; GAYEYou gave me my first drink , Johnny . &nbsp; ROCCO ( to her ) So it 's all my fault , is it ? Everybody has their first drink , do n't they ? ( to them ) But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GAYE ( almost in tears ) If I'da known you were going to act like this , I would n't of come here . &nbsp; ROCCOAnd if I'da known what you 're like , you would n't been asked .

You would n't know she was the same dame . &nbsp; GAYEYou certainly have n't changed one bit . &nbsp; ROCCOMeaning what ? &nbsp; GAYE ( retreating ) Nothing . Gee , honey . . . Do n't be mean to me . &nbsp; ROCCO ( with heavy sarcasm ) " Mean to me . " Now what 's that remind me of ? &nbsp; CURLYDo n't you remember ? It was a song . She used to sing it .  --  75  --  &nbsp; ROCCO ( confidentially to the others ) I gave her her first chance . Took her out of the chorus . Made her a singer . ( to her ) Mention that while you 're at it . Why ai n't you a singing star instead of a lush , huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; ROCCO ( as though speaking of the deceased ) She coulda had a future . &nbsp; CURLYThat 's right . She has everything . &nbsp; ROCCO ( generously ) Looks , a voice , and lotsa class . Their words send Gaye careening backwards through the years for a moment . Her hand goes to her hair in an unconscious gesture . &nbsp; GAYE ( to others ) I was the rage . ( to Rocco ) Gee , honey . &nbsp; ROCCO ( with murderous gentleness ) Why'nt you sing us your old song , Gaye ? &nbsp; GAYE ( swallows ) You mean right now ?  --  76  --  &nbsp; ROCCOSure . &nbsp; GAYE ( her hands tremble ) I ca n't . &nbsp; ROCCO ( encouragingly ) Sure you can . &nbsp; GAYEDo n't make me , Johnny . &nbsp; ROCCOI would n't make you do anything . Tell you what : I got a proposition for you . Sing us your song and you can have a drink . &nbsp; GAYE ( hesitates , then ) Can I have the drink first ? &nbsp; ROCCO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . then the drink . &nbsp; GAYEWithout any accompaniment ? &nbsp; ROCCOYou want a drink or do n't you ? &nbsp; GAYE ( after a pause ) All right . She gets up from the bar stool . She looks at M'Cloud and the others . Her face is rigid . She stands there frozen , not doing anything . &nbsp; ROCCOWell ? She appeals to him silently . Her mournful eyes look into his but see no reprieve . She takes a breath and begins . She faces her " audience " . Her voice is as jerky as her hands . It is difficult for her to control the loose muscles of her face .  --  77  --  &nbsp; GAYEI always wore a low-cut gown . Very day-coll-tay . I wore hardly any make-up . Just a little lip rouge . No lights . Just a baby spot . I did n't have any entrance . They 'd play the intro in the dark . The spot would come on . . . and there I 'd be . Rocco applauds . Curly , Toots and Ralph take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel sits in a corner and remains quiet . She is not certain whether they are ridiculing her or not . She assumes her singing pose . Then , once more she freezes , unable to utter a note . &nbsp; ROCCO ( impatiently ) Go ahead . Sing . In a voice that is at once faltering and brassy , she begins to sing : " Mean to Me . " &nbsp; GAYE " You 're mean to me . Why must you be mean to me ? Gee , honey , but ca n't you see What you mean to me ? " Now her shaking hands make the same gestures that she made fifteen years ago . The gestures are out-of-date , pathetic . The sentimental feeling of her wretched song is in conflict with her own misery . She tries bravel to enter into the spirit of the song , to be the Gaye Dawn of fifteen years ago . But every note she sings , and every palsied gesture , are additions to the sum of her failure . Her tragedy is reflected in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looks at them . M'Cloud , on the other hand , meets her gaze squarely . It is as though he were trying to impart some of his own strength to her . Curly shakes his head as though to say : She ai n't  --  78  --  got it any more . Toots ca n't help giggling . Rocco looks on expressionlessly , betraying neither approval nor disapproval . Gaye is now in her final stanza . She has given up all hope of pleasing any of her audience . She wants now only to finish her song and her own agony . &nbsp; GAYE " You 're mean to me . Why must you be mean to me ? Gee , honey , but ca n't you see What you mean to me ? " There is no longer any question now of applause . The dreadful silence is broken by Toots ' giggle repeating itself . However , even that infuriating sound serves to relieve the situation . Gaye 's knees buckle . She slips down onto a chair , holding her hands , trying to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny . &nbsp; ROCCO ( after a pause ) No . &nbsp; GAYE ( appalled ) Johnny ! &nbsp; ROCCONo . &nbsp; GAYEBut you promised . &nbsp; ROCCOSo what ! &nbsp; GAYEYou said if I song . . . . &nbsp; ROCCOYou were rotten . She begins to cry .  --  79  --  Now M'Cloud rises . He goes to the bar . He pours a straight shot of whiskey into a glass . He takes the glass to Gaye . He holds it out to her . She grabs it and drinks it down . Temple sighs with relief . Admiration kindles in Nora 's eyes for M'Cloud . Toots ' jaw sags momentarily . Then he snaps his head toward Rocco . Curly examines the ash on his cigar between glances at Rocco and M'Cloud . Rocco gets up deliberately . He walks over to where M'Cloud is standing . He measures M'Cloud . Then he brings his hand violently against M'Cloud 's face . M'Cloud takes it . Rocco slaps him three times . Each slap is deliberate , sharp , calculated to bring a response . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less anger . Knowing very well there would be a penalty for aiding Gaye , M'Cloud accepts it without display of any kind . Gaye looks up at M'Cloud from her chair . Her hands have stopped trembling . The desperation has gone out of her eyes . &nbsp; GAYE ( with profound gratitude ) Thank you . &nbsp; M'CLOUD ( smiles at her ) You 're welcome . M'Cloud turns away from her and goes back to his Chair . Curly brings out a deck of cards . He turns to Toots , who is standing nearby . &nbsp; CURLYPlay a little gin ? &nbsp; TOOTSOkay . Toots takes a seat across from Curly . Curly fans the cards across the tabletop . They each pick a card to see who will be the dealer . Curly deals . &nbsp; CURLYFor how much ?  --  80  --  &nbsp; TOOTSYou name it . &nbsp; CURLYNickle a point . Once again the hurricane strikes the hotel . Where before it was only a fierce wind , now it is a blast that threatens to rip the building out by its roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture falls from the wall . The glasses and bottles on the shelves behind the bar rattle and quake . Rocco blanches . He spreads his legs , bracing himself . The others remain rigid in their positions . For a long moment fear has possession of the room . Rocco brings himself to face Old Man Temple . &nbsp; ROCCO ( hoarsely ) Hey , old man ! How bad can this get ? ( Temple does n't answer ) I asked you something . D'ja hear me ? &nbsp; TEMPLE ( finally ) The worst storm we ever had was back in 1935 . The wind whipped up a big wave and sent it busting right across Matecumbe Key . Eight hundred people were washed out to sea . &nbsp; ROCCO ( he begins to sweat - he swallows ) How far away was that from here ? &nbsp; TEMPLE ( simply ) A few miles . Rocco 's head revolves as he eyes the walls , expecting to see them torn away . Nora , during the preceding , has come to M'Cloud 's table . She sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NORAI 'm sorry about the things I said upstairs . I know they are n't true .

Everyone falls silent . Between blasts of the wind we can HEAR THE SURGE AND ROAR of the angry sea . Now and then a wave strikes the house . Occasionally there is a clap of thunder which snakes the glasses behind the bar . Rocco listens to the SOUNDS of the hurricane with growing fear . He begins to pace . He follows a regular beat , almost like an animal in a cage . Whenever the sound of the wind reaches a certain note , he freezes into a position of waiting .  --  82  --  Toots and Curly are holding their cards but they are not playing . Gaye sits at the bar . Her eyes are fastened on M'Cloud . There is grateful adoration in her glance . The silence continues for a long time . Finally it becomes unbearable to Rocco .

There is nothing for him to do but go back to his pacing . Section Details 64 . CLOSE SHOT GAYE She watches Rocco pacing back and forth . A smile flicks across her face . She knows what is bothering Rocco . She knows from experience that he is afraid , that while he will never fear man . . . he will quail before the intangible of nature . Rocco becomes aware of her eyes on him . He puts his hands in his pockets to keep from fiddling with them . However , as the next big blast of wind grips the house , his hands are out again . The fingers on his right hand again begin to pull at the ring on his left hand , slipping the ring on and off , on and off . He catches himself at this and thrusts his hands back into his pockets again . Suddenly Rocco wheels on Gaye . &nbsp; ROCCO ( voice strained ) What 's the matter with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Curly and Toots , who hold their cards mutely in their hands , not intent on their game at all .  --  83  --  &nbsp; ROCCOWhy 's everybody so quiet ?

Curly talks but his mind is not on his words .

He listens to the wind . &nbsp; TOOTSSo what ? &nbsp; CURLY ( automatically ) Naturally , the papers play it up big . . . and . . . the public . . . . it gets the idea that prohibition 's no good . And if they get rid of it . . . . . prohibition , I mean . . . . . Curly stops talking again . Rocco has been paying no attention to Curly . He suddenly confronts Temple . &nbsp; ROCCO ( to Temple ) I do n't believe it ! ( Temple does n't answer ) Eight hundred guys getting washed out to sea . You 're a liar ! ( he glares at Temple . How he tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing like that happened . ( turns to Curly ) Would they , Curly ? &nbsp; CURLYI remember reading about it in the paper . &nbsp; TEMPLE ( deliberately ) They were veterans of the  --  85  --  First War . The gov'ment had given ' em work building the Highway that runs right past our door . Thirty dollars a month , they were getting . ( nods his head ) Signals began flying on Labor Day . A relief train was dispatched from Miami to evacuate the veterans . The barometer . . . ( he points to it behind the bar ) . . . was down to about 26 inches , when the train pulled into Homestead . The engineer backed his string of empty coaches into the danger zone . But just before it got to where the veterans were bivouacked , the hurricane hit ! ( reliving it ) All the coaches were knocked right off the track . Two hundred miles an hour , that wind blew . A tidal wave twelve feet high swept across the keys . Whole towns were wiped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed away . Nothing was left of the veterans ' camps . More'n five hundred bodies were recovered after the storm . And for months afterward corpses were found in the mangrove swamps . ( pause ) There 's a Memorial down the road a piece . Inside are the remains of a few of the veterans . If you still do n't believe me. . . go take a look at it . There is a long silence again . Curly can not take his eyes off Old Man Temple . Once having found comfort in the more sound of words ,  --  86  --  Curly now does not want there to be a silence . He resumes talking exactly where he left off . &nbsp; CURLYSo the public votes out prohibition . That 's the end of the mobs . Next time it 'll be different , though . We learned our lesson , all right . Next time the mobs 'll get together . . . . . He is silenced by the greatest blast of wind yet . Rocco stands stock still . His hands grip the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay . The hurricane has now reached its climax and its terror has dug deep into his insides . &nbsp; TEMPLE ( with religious zeal ) Make a big wave , God .

Shut up ! &nbsp; TEMPLEHear me , O , God . Rocco takes the pistol out of his pocket . He walks over to Temple and thrusts it into the Old Man 's face . &nbsp; ROCCOI 'll kill you . &nbsp; M'CLOUD ( rises ) Rocco !  --  87  --  Rocco swivels toward M'Cloud , levelling his pistol . &nbsp; TEMPLEMake a big wave , God .
