Artificial arms &; legs are still in the Model T era ; changes come slowly , are often mere tinkering . But last week the Veterans Administration had good news of a sort for the 17,000 World War II amputees . It had approved a new arm &; leg which embodies some useful improvements . They were produced , oddly , not by limb experts but by an aviation company , Northrop Aircraft . <P> Northrop was persuaded to go out on the limb because of its experience in working with light materials . Designed by a crew of engineers , the Northrop arm is a plastic and aluminum affair weighing half a pound to a pound less than previous arms . Other advantages : a new wrist mechanism ( for arms amputated below the elbow ) which makes it possible to rotate the wrist in either direction ; a steel cable , replacing smelly leather thongs ; an improved elbow lock . The Northrop leg , similarly , is lighter , has a suction socket and locking knee . <P> The Northrop limbs , now ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers willing to make and fit them ) , are the first products of artificial limb research launched by the Government 21 months ago . A civilian committee , now under the National Research Council , has spent $500,000 on research , has $1,200,000 more to spend . But Model A is not yet in sight .
