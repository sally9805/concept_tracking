AIR Builder of Big Ships <P> ( See Cover ) <P> The big Consolidated boat was at 18,000 feet over the Atlantic and the oxygen was sobbing comfortably in the crew 's masks . Then it happened . Somehow the automatic pilot jammed . With its right aileron all the way down , the 15-ton Catalina went into a violent left turn , headed for the sea . In the dizzy spiral dive the aileron carried away , took part of the tip of the wing with it . Then the left aileron ripped off . An operator in the United Kingdom heard the frenetic chirp from the Catalina 's radio : " Both ailerons gone . " <P> He heard no more , expected never to hear . One new Catalina was charged off as " lost on ferry . " Six hours later the boat , with its truncated wing raffish as an empty tooth socket , turned up at a United Kingdom seaport , lurched to a landing . Somehow its pilots had straightened it out , just off the water , flown it in-with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saga of the Catalina , which the U.S. Navy calls the PBY . <P> One man who was not amazed by this performance was the Catalina 's builder , big , blue-eyed Major Reuben Hollis Fleet , chief executive and chief owner of Consolidated Aircraft Corp . Like all oldtimers in Consolidated 's tightly knit hierarchy , he has long since ceased to be surprised at any feat a Cat performs . But he has not lost his capacity for pride . It has plenty to feed on in the Cat 's nest in a sunlit stretch between crowded Pacific Highway and San Diego ( Calif . ) Bay . <P> For there , to " Rube " Fleet 's eye ( and to the eye of many a layman ) , is the most dramatic visual proof to be found in the U.S. that the tools to beat Adolf Hitler , no longer just " on order , " are at work . In the yard , under the sun by day , under floodlights at night ( in San Diego climate hangars are unnecessary ) , sits a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not little ships . They are whoppers , all of them . Each represents thousands of hours of labor , each is a mighty ship of war . In the three big final assembly buildings , they come off the lines at a rate ( military secret ) of so many a day ; no longer , as big bomber production was once appraised , at so many a month . <P> Saga . What first catches the layman 's eye in the Cat 's yard is not the wide-winged PBYs with their tapered tails , but the graceful , powerful forms , of immense four-motored bombers resting on tricycle landing gears . These are the newest brothers of the Cat : the B-24s . The British call them Liberators . These big bombers are 4,000 pounds bigger than Boeing 's famed Flying Fortresses . The B-24 has already followed the Cat into the war in Europe . <P> Across the yard is ranked another group of giants , massive of hull , with long , tapering , twin-ruddered tails . These are Consolidated 's big boats-PB2Ys , four-en-gined big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleet turns out , they are built to Fleet 's most important hallmark : long range . These giants , designed for naval patrol , can travel 5,200 miles-possibly more-on a single load of gas . They can cruise at 170 m.p.h. on 45% of the power of their four Pratt &; Whitney 1,200-h.p. engines .
