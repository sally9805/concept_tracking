T N 1942 , Mr. and Mrs. Smith discovered that their eon George was afflicted with periodic fits . They took him out of school , explained to him that be could not play with other children again , and kept him confined to his own home as a permanent invalid . They were warmhearted and tender parents ; biding their grief , I hey gave him hooks and toys and all their kindness and affection . They did not , however , call a doctor . Last summer , with George suffering an average of five major convulsive seizures a week , a doctor visited the Smiths  --  not to see George , but to treat Mr. Smith for a broken arm , It was during this visit that George had one of his Revere attacks . When the seizure had ended , the doctor asked , " How long has this been going on ' ? " " About five years , " said Mrs. Smith . Who is his physician ? " " He does n't have one . You see , we know our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing that can be done ? " " Good God ! " muttered the doctor . " Look , Mrs. Smith , I 'd like you to bring the boy to the hospital tomorrow morning . We 'll examine him , and then I think we can show you something . " The next day , after a careful examination had confirmed the diagnosis , the doctor gave George some white , slightly bitter pills and said , " I hope these will do the trick . " They did . Taking those pills regularly , three times a day , George never had another epileptic attack . To his mother and father , it was a miracle  --  a miracle which they themselves had delayed for five tragic years . The case of George Smith  --  that is n't his real name  --  is indicative . In the United States today . epilepsy is believed to be more prevalent than either diabetes or active tuberculosis , afflicting more than 500,000 and perhaps as many as 1,000,000 victims . A recent survey indicated that all the doctors in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one third of them . Most of the rest , like George Smith , suffer needlessly . " There , " declares one expert , " is the real tragedy of epilepsy . With the new methods and medicines we have today , we can lick epilepsy . Not completely , but in at least seventy or eighty per cent of the victims . However , we ca n't help patients who do n't come to us . " Why do n't all epileptics seek medical care ? Most of them , the survey showed , do n't know that doctors can control epilepsy . Some are afraid they will be sent to an insane asylum . Some are afraid of the disgrace that might follow , fearing they will lose their jobs or their social position or their friends , for epilepsy is too often considered a " taint " disease and something which should not be mentioned in polite society . It is widely believed that epilepsy is the sign of mental degeneracy or at least the beginning of insanity . To this belief , doctors say " Rubbiehl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blamed on some devil winch had entered the brain . Modern authorities think that the holes found in the simile of ancient envemen and of the early Incas were bored by medicine men so that the devil could get out . The early Greeks ascribed it to the visitation of a god , and accordingly called it the Sacred Disease . This idea was ridiculed by one cagey Greek doctor , the great Hippocrates , who insisted the disease was due to a natural hut still unknown cause . Until the last part of the nineteenth century , nobody knew any way to control the disease . Medical men tried to cure it with powdered human skull , the fresh blood of a dying gladiator , wolf 's liver , boar 's gall , opium , hashish , turpentine , acids , alkalies , extract of mistletoe , and prayer . None of these remedies watt particularly effective . The first treatment with any value at all was discovered by mistake . Sir Charles Locock , a wealthy , unscientific , but highly successful obstetrician  --  he was personal obstetrician to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with too much sexual ardor . He also believed that a newly discovered drug , potassium bromide , might serve as an antidote to such passions . By combining these two ideas , he came out in 1857 with the bromide treatment for epilepsy . Although later research showed that his reasoning was all wrong , his treatment worked , and some hospitals were soon dispensing as many as 1500 doses of bromides a day . Unfortunately , it did not work very well ; only about 20 out of 100 patients got any relief , and many patients were sensitive to the drug , breaking out in bromide rashes and developing other unpleasant symptoms . Bromides seemed to work because they were sedatives . Looking for other sedatives which might control epilepsy . Dr. Alfred Hauptmann in 1911 ran into phenobarbital , produced by German chemists as a remedy for insomnia . " Its field of applicability , " he reported , " will be chiefly in those very severe cases of epilepsy which can no longer be controlled by the largest dose of bromides . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale . " Nobody was particularly excited about it , " says Doctor Hauptmann , who is now on the staff of the Pratt Diagnostic Center and the Tufts Medical School in Boston . He himself did not push it very enthusiastically . " Although I was verymuch interested in epilepsy , I was also interested in a flashy automobile which I was buying on a monthly installment plan , " he recalls . In the United States , phenobarbital received a more cordial welcome . One Chicago doctor tried it on a clergyman 's son , a thirteen-year-old who had been suffering five or six attacks a day and who could not take bromides without getting an irritating skin rash . " I decided to try phenobarbital , " said the Chicago physician . " The effect was marvelous and almost instantaneous . No more attacks were reported . " Phenobarbital was generally considered to he better than bromides , but it , too , had a serious drawback . It was essentially a sleep-producing chemical . To prevent their convulsions , some people had to take so much phenobarbital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Together . phenobarbital and bromides made only a minor dent in epilepsy . A few scientists tried to find something better , but failed . By about 1920 , it was generally conceded that further improvements were impossible and that , with only minor exceptions , the control of epilepsy was hopeless . Then came Dr. William Gordon Lennox and the case of X. Bill Lennox was a shy , soft-spoken , retiring medical missionary . Some of his friends called him mousy , but declared that while he would run from a rabbit , he would fight any number of lions or tigers . Born in 1884 , he was the son of a Colorado gold-mine operator who had struck it moderately rich in the Cripple Creek gold rush and t hen had invested his mon'y in a 200,000-acre cattle ranch in Texas . When young Bill graduated from Colorado College , lie married Emma Buchtel , daughter of the governor of Colorado , went to ( Cmitinued Pnav RN ) // the Harvard Medical School , interned at Mitaanchueetts General Hospital , and then llllll uunced he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned I intended to he a medical missionary there , " he says , " they were horrified . The talents of a Harvard man , it seemed , would be wasted on the Chinese . But Lennox went anyhow , taking his wife and ( heir two baby daughters . After four years in China , he discovered epilepsy . Young X , an American and the promising child of his beat friend , developed convulsions , and neither the most skillful Chinese doctors nor the most outstanding American medical men in Peiping could help . At I he same time , the two Lennox children became seriously ill with dysentery , and he decided to take them hack to America . Then he went to Harvard to find a position and , at the same lime , to seek a cure for X. " I was positive that there would be specialists in Boston who could do something , " he recalls , " but they were n't much better than the Chinese medicine men . " One Boston expert said , " Epilepsy ? Here 's a prescription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No school . Better put 1 he child on a farm . " Another said , " Too bad . No meat , no excitement . Give bromides . Have the parents considered an epileptic col-ony ? ? Lennox became slightly annoyed . He went to the Harvard medical library and discovered that the most up-to-date book on epilepsy was fifteen years old . The current medical journals contained obviously ridiculous essays on the influence of enlarged colons and on some mysterious " epilepsy bacteria . " The most authoritative authors agreed that epilepsy- is " by definition a progressive disease , ending in mental and physical decay , completely hopeless . " Lennox became more annoyed . " Poor little X was still suffering from convulsions , " he said , " and I could n't find any improved treatment . Furthermore , I could n't find anyone who was making a careful search for one . " He realized that , he was poorly %quipped to do medical research  --  a decision with which many of his colleagues vociferously agreed  --  but decided that he would have to tackle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cobb , he organized the money-begging Harvard Epilepsy Commission to finance the studies . The first benefactor was a wealthy New York attorney whose epileptic son had been given some temporary relief by a semi-starvation diet . " Find out what connection there is between diet and epilepsy , " said the lawyer . " I 'll back you . " The hunt began with an invest igation of starvation and diet and continued with studies of blood chemistry , mental treatment , and all the time-honored drugs . Instead of curing epilepsy , these agents made it worse . In 1928 , Lennox and Cobb wrote a progress report which was a monument of pessimism . They had cleared out the deadwood and found nothing . " After two thousand years of studying epilepsy , " Lennox concluded , " the medical profession was stranded in a maze of blind alleys . " It seemed that the underlying cause of an epileptic attack is some peculiar chemical or physicochemical change in the nerve cells in the brain , and thatthis change makes certain clumps of cells discharge electrically at " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced this change in the nerve cells ? What might prevent it ? What might control it ? Was n't there something better than bromides or phenobarbital ? " We simply did n't know , " said Lennox , bul  --  slill watching young X  --  he was convinced that there had to be a better treatment . Leaving his missionary work permanently , he next worked almost alone for half a dozen years , quietly continuing to train himself as a research worker . Then , by what he calls a lucky break , he acquired Fred and Erna Gibbs as his associates , and together they studied the brains of patients , invest igated their brain blood circulation , and measured the amounts of oxygen and sugar that these brains burned . They studied livers , hearts , spleens and kidneys . They became amateur genealogists to trace the appearance of epilepsy in families . In the early 1930 's , a brilliant young brain surgeon , Dr. Tracy J. Putnam , fell under Lennox 's spell and became a convert . " At first , " says Putnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleys . The boys had tried diet , surgery , drugs  --  everything they could think of . Everything came out with negative results . Nothing was ? any good  --  nothing but bromide or phenobarbital . I was ready to quit before I started . But Bill Lennox would n't let me . " The one thing which constantly intrigued the scientists was phenobarbital . " Why is it even partially effective ? " they kept asking . " Why does it work at all ? " Putnam did n't know . Phenobarbital , he realized , was not a particularly mysterious chemical . It was a member ofthe barbital family , hut , strangely enough , the only member of t hat family which worked against epilepsy . Methyl-barbital , ethyl-barbital , diethyl-barbital , all the rest of the barhitale  --  they could put you to sleep , but not one of them could prevent convulsions . " You could hammer your brains out trying to figure what it all meant , " declared Putnam , " hut you could n't get beyond that one fact  --  the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , Putnam came up with the answer : " Maybe it 's not the ' barbital ' in phenobarbital that , acts in epilepsy . Maybe it 's the ' pheno ' part ! " He went to his desk , ran through the catalogues from all the American drug manufacturers , and listed every pheno , phenol and phenyl derivative on the market . From this list he scratched off the names of compounds which he thought would be dangerous . He put in orders for all the rest  --  about 700 different substances . When they arrived , each of these drugs was tested with a simple , ingenious machine devised by the Harvard workers to administer a carefully measured electrical shock to a cat . They first found how much electricity it would take to put the cat into a fit . Then they gave the cat a dose of the drug to be studied , waited until it had been assimilated , and again measured the convulsive dose of electricity . Around I he laboratory , it was known as the " cat-fits " technique . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the job might have taken years . In three weeks , however , they had something . " There are three compounds here . " one of the men reported , " which look pretty interesting . " One of them prevented convulsions , but , unfortunately , produced virtually staggering burps . This one was discarded . The second also prevented convulsions , but it tasted frightful . The I hird , sent from the Parke . Davis Laboratories , was di-phenyl-hydantoinate . It just seemed to prevent c s ions . " How does it compare with bromide or phenobarbital ' ? " asked Lennox . " About ten times better , " the Harvard workers told him . Di-phenyl-hydantoinate  --  soon to he known as dilantin  --  was next taken over by Dr. H. Houston Merritt , who , in co-operation with the Parke . Davis workers , put it through the most rigorous tests . It was given by stomach tube and by injection to cats , dogs . rats , mice and guinea pigs . It was given in small doses , medium doses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twice a day , three times El day , ten times a day . It was given to some animals day after day for months on end , while the scientists watched for any-sign of poisoning . " This drug , " said Merritt , " will have to be taken daily for years and perhaps for life by epileptic patients . It has to be safe . " At the same time , the workers checked their results with the electroencephalograph , the new brain-wave machine " which had been developed a few years before in Germany and improved by Lennox 's teammates , Doctor and Mrs. Gibbs . This brain-wave machine showed electrically what the brain was doing . It revealed that an epileptic attack is accompanied by a veritable electrical brainstorm , an outpouring of detectable electrical currents . It could help to diagnose epilepsy , indicate its severity , tell when it was getting better or worse , and often help a doctor de- 110 tormine whether or not his epileptic patients should marry or have children . " And now it told us in electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our eyes , " Lennox staid . " It told us that dilantin was effective against , disturbed brain rhythms as well as against convulsions . IL was unquestionably effective . . . in animals . " In March , 1936 , dilantin had been leafed and found safe enough to be used on the first patient . He was a thirty-year-old Italian who , late one night , was carried into the emergency ward at Boston City Hospital . " We found him on the street , " reported the policeman who brought him in , " He was having tits something terrible ! " The patient was no stranger around the hospital , where he had been treated fur years as a victim of apparently uncora reliable epilept ic seizures . His convulsions came so often that he could n't hold a job . Not even massive doses of bromide or phenobarbital would help Interns and nurses put the patient into bed and left him there under observation . From his past record , they knew he would probably have another attack before morning . And then one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ought to tell him that ibis guy is hack in here again , " he suggested . " He and Put nam have some new drug they 're working on . " Doctor Merritt , summoned by telephone , came to the hospital and looked at the patient . " How 're you doing , Tony ? " he asked . " Not so good , doc . I had a bad one tonight , The cops , they hadda bring me in here . I du n no how long I can ep this up . Ca n't you gim me some medicine to stop it ? " Merritt grinned . " Sure , I think we can give you something . How 'd you like to try a new one we 've fixed up here ? " " Sure . Sure , doe . Anything you may . " A few minutes later , Tony drank a glees of water in which had been dissolved a little bit of white , slightly pungent powder . " What 's gon na happen now ? " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " nothing will happen  --  nothing at all . " Nothing did happen . The expected convulsion did n't come . And the next day , with a little more of the powder dissolved in water and given to the patient , there was still no seizure . " Keep taking this stuff three times a day , " Merritt ordered . Dilantin , taken three times a day , stopped Tony 's epilepsy  --  not for a day or a week or a month , but permanently . He could live once more like a human being . He could go back to his job  --  it happened to be in a Boston necktie factory  --  and thereafter Merritt was flooded with a steady stream of the biggest , brightest neckties in Massachusetts . The news of this preliminary triumph was brought to Lennox . It was the answer to his prayers , the result of nearly twenty years of ceaseless working and stimulating and inspiring . " That sounds very good , " he remarked , " but you should try it on more patients . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual convent ion of the American Medical ARROciat ion in San Francisco and reported t heir results on 118 patients suffering from major epilepsy . " In nearly thirty per cent , " they said . " there was a marked reduction in the number and severity of attacks . In nearly sixty per cent , there was complete relief . " Furthermore , they said , when this drug was properly administered , it produced no skin rash , no stupor , no grogginess . This and later reports given by Putnam and Merritt brought forth an ern 112 1'IIK SATUIliD4Y EVENING POST lanuat7 17 . MIS harrassing deluge of letters , telegrams , lelepl calla and cables from over- Physicians , parents and the vict Una themselves sent their blessings to the two researchers . At his own insistence , Lennox remained in the background and emphatically claimed that this was none of his doing , that Putnam and Merritt did all the work , and 111 ; 11 they deserved all the credit . " By definition , epilepsy is a condition which can not be helped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t hal they should n't waste time on it . But look what they 've done  --  they 've given us the most effective anticonvulNam drug that we have ever known ! " Although it was no complete cure , and t here is evidence that tolerance to it may he built up , dilantin allowed thousands of epileptics to live normal lives . Side reactions  --  skin rash , stomach distress , dizziness  --  seemed to be inevitable in some patients , but careful administration of the drug kept them to a minimum . With dilantin , most epileptics could look forward to going to school , getting married , having children , holding nearly any kind of job  --  except driving automobiles or working at great heights or near moving machinery  --  and , in short , living like other people . Like diabetics with h their insulin , epileptics merely had to be faithful in taking their dilantin under strict medical supervision . To physicians , dilantin was the answer for a majority of their epileptic patients . They could help a few others by special diets or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or scar tissue which were responsible for the convuLsions and which could he detected by brain x-rays or the electroencephalograph . But there was one type of epilepsy in which surgery and dilantin and everything else were close to useless . This was a relatively infrequent type . accounting for about one case in ten , and occurring mostly in children . This was petit ma ! , the " little sickness . " Unlike the major and most shocking form of epilepsy , grand mat , with its violent convulsions , tongue biting and foaming at the mouth , petit mat is marked by short losses of consciousness which may occur from once to twenty-five or even fifty times a day . Each of these temporary mental blackouts lasts only a few seconds , rarely more than half a minute . The attack may be accompanied by a momentary rhythmic twitching of the face muscles , which is sometimes the only sign that a parent may notice . In still other cases , the affected child may suddenly lose his postural control ; without warning , he will fall down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now gray and stooped , petit mat was another challenge which must be met . " He has spent his life acting as if ( he entire field of epilepsy was his personal responsibility , " one associate claimed . " He just does n't know how to stop . " He went to the laboratories , urging more men to do more research . He went to the big drug companies , asking them to test every new compound on convulsions . He went to the big faunda I ionsand to patients and their friends , asking for more and more money  --  not for himself , but for carrying on research , for educating patients , for educating physicians and for educating educators . " It is exceedingly odd , " he told school officials , " that so many schools and colleges are loath to admit students with epilepsy , even though their attacks may be controlled by dilantin . Under present-day rules , it seems that no modern military academy would accept such eminent epileptics as Julius Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte . And any person showing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have great difficulty in gaining admission to a modern theological school ! " In 1940 , the epilepsy fighters seeking a weapon against petit mat were given their first clue . It came from the Abbott Laboratories in North Chicago , and from a research study which had nothing to do with epilepsy . An Abbott chemist , trying to create a new and superior painkiller as a substitute for aspirin , produced a substance with the imposing name of " **36;3054;TOOLONG , " soon to be shortened to " tridione . " Preliminary trials , first on animals and then on human volunteers , suggested that tridione might he considerably better than aspirin . Later , however , it was found to be not . altogether reliable . Sometimes it stopped pain , sometimes it did n't , and somel imesin about half the adults , but never in children  --  it temporarily interfered with color perception in bright sunlight . Tridione was shelved for the time being . Meanwhile the chemists produced a second chemical which was intended to control a certain type of painful muscle spasm . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men decided to enhance its value by mixing it with tridione . Up to this point , they had not even thought of epilepsy , but their next discovery changed their thinking . This second chemical in large doses could be quite dangerous , producing violent convulsions in animals . But , when combined with tridione , it never produced convulsions . Dr. Richard K. Richards , one of Abbott 's top drug experts , looked at this result and announced , " Wonderful ! We have a new drug for epilepsy . " To him , there was only one possible conclusion . If tridione could control chemically produced convulsions , then it should control the convulsions of epilepsy . With his colleagues , Doctor Richards then proceeded to undertake long series of tests on animals , giving them **25;3092;TOOLONG like strychnine , metrazol and cocaine , and then trying to prevent or control these convulsions with tridione , They found that when tridione was given beforehand to mice , it completely prevented t seizures ; given even while the m were in the midst of convulsive attar it stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't always act like Although the new drug was effect against convulsions in rodents , it w soon found to be close to worth against epileptic convulsions in human beings . Once again tridione was head-4 ing for oblivion , but fortunately Dr. Meyer Perlatein decided to try it on a small group of children at Chicago 's Cook County Hospital . These youngsters were suffering not from convulsions , but from petit-ma ! epilepsy , from momentary mental black-outs which came five , ten or twenty times a day . On them , tridione was magnificent . The Abbott men went into a huddle . " If tridione may be good for petit ma ! , " one of them proposed , " we 'd better give it a real trial . We 'd better have it tested by the man who owns epilepsy , " Off went a letter to Bill Lennox in Boston : " We have recently developed a new drug . . . . We think it may be useful for petit mat . Would you be interested in undertaking further tests ? " Back came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lennox had been fighting his usual battle against the inertia of doctors who claimed , " You 're wasting your time bothering with petit mat . It is n't so horrible . And most kids with petit mat will get better by themselves sooner or later . " Lennox took a very dim view of such arguments . " There are perhaps a hundred thousand victims of petit mat in t his country , " he wrote in one technical review . " And even though the healing forces of nature usually bring a spontaneous cure , this distant prospect is of no great comfort to parents who find the educational and social progress of their children blocked by attacks which recur many times every day . " To him , tridione was useless or even harmful in grand mat , but it was the long-awaited answer to petit ma ! , to " black-out epilepsy . " In his clinic at THE SATURDAY EVENING POST Januar , 11. 19111 the Children 's Hospital . he tried it on girl who ' Ind been having more than forty black-outs a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tridione reduced the at tacks to one a week , and wit hin another four months the attacks had slopped completely . He tried it on tin eleven-year-old boy who had been blacking out twenty or thirty times a day for six years ; two monde ( after tridione treatment began , his seizures stopped and did not return even when I he medicine was discontinued . These children , soon followed by scorns of others , quickly began to eat better , put on weight , win better marks in school , and  --  of particular importance  --  get along better with their parents , leachers and playmates . In these children , except for an occasional rash or sensitivity to light , the drug operated smoothly and safely . Later , it was found that in a very small number  --  perhaps one in many thousands  --  tridione can damage the blood system and even cause death , and for this reason the blood of patients under treatment must be examined monthly . Rut , for an overwhelming proportion of children , it was entirely safe . In December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a meeting of the Association for Research in Nervous and Mental Disease . For two days , medical experts from Canada and the United States reported on all aspects of epilepsy research ; they announced preliminary results with new drugs like mesantoin , a promising ally of diluntin , and with other treatments still under experimentation . Then Lennox and his associate , Dr. Jean Davis , revealed their results with 182 pefil-mal patients treated with tridione . " None hadexperienced relief fromany previous treatment , " they asserted . " However , tridione completely wiped out the attacks in thirty-one per cent , and in another thirty-one per cent reduced t hem bymore than three quarters , a saving for this group of one hundred and ei ght y-two pat ien tsof something like four hundred t housand seizures a yeuu- . " At the end of the meeting , Dr. Wilder Penfield , of Montreal , one of Canada 's distinguished authorities on epilepsy , rose and asked the president 's permission to make an announcement . " Sure , go ahead , " said Lennox . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembled doctors , he continued , " I want to express our debt to Doctor Lennox , as evidenced by his writings and by the movements he has started . He is author or coauthor of two hooks and of some one hundred and fifty medical articles dealing with research and exposition of epilepsy . . . . He organized the American Epilepsy League . He is president of the International League Against Epilepsy . He is National Consultant on Epilepsy to the Veterans Administration  --  " Hey , " whispered Lennox . " Sh-h ! " countered Penfield , who then announced that , without Lennox ' . knowledge , his colleagues . patients and admirers from all over the American continent had established the William G. Lennox Fund to be used for the future attack 's on epilepsy . " This ie a spontaneous , enthusiastic tribute from epileptics and from members of his own profession , a tribute to a physician who is also a scientist , a scholar , a historian , an organizer ; a man , above all , whose unfailing kindliness has endeared him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sufferer 's in his chosen field . " For a moment there was complete silence . Then the doctors broke out in a roaring , thunderous ovation . One of the people who joined in the applause that day was X , whose convulsions a quarter of a century before had first aroused Lennox 's interest in the disease . X no longer had convulsions , for treatment had eliminated them completely , and X was no longer a child , but a well-trained , brilliant young scientist who properly belonged in that audience of experts . Doctor X had now become one of the new leaders in the fight against epilepsy , .  --
