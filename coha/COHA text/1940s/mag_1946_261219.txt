Westbrook Pegler found a friend . The name was Petrillo-James Caesar Petrillo , boss of U.S. musicians . Last week Hearst readers rubbed their eyes as Peg , the usually caustic carp of organized labor , was caught cheering a strike . <P> Petrillo 's A.F.L. musicians , turned down after asking 25% more pay , had walked off the bandstands of over 50 New York hotels ( including the Waldorf-Astoria , St. Moritz , Savoy-Plaza ) . Cried Pegler : ' ' I hope the hotels and the musicians ' union never come permanently to terms . " <P> Pegler , it seems , has a scunner against the modern hotel : it is no longer a home away from home . In Pegler 's eyes , it is " a combination dance hall , vaudeville house , nightclub and rat race for disorderly elements . . . . We who rent the rooms . . . have been imposed upon grievously ... to accommodate . . . casuals off the streets who come to dance , drink and marvel in alcoholic stupor at ... the tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe . . . and pretty little thrips who sing mischievously about adultery . . . while Ollie Twitch and his reefer boys are tearing the atmosphere to bleeding tatters from the platform and some agile mugger with greased hair is twining a boneless female around his neck and exhibiting an impersonal patch of leg meat , hers . " * <P> " Dear Mr. Putrilluh . " But New Yorkers did not share the Peglerian appetite for musicless meals . Business dropped in Manhattan 's huge , noise-deadened ballrooms . Out-of-town affiliates of struck New York hotels were hit by sympathy walkouts . Chicago 's Palmer House , part of the Hilton chain , bravely put on its Empire Room show without an orchestra . The handful of customers groaned . <P> Petrillo flew from Chicago to New York to pull out all the stops . Muzak Corp . agreed not to pipe in canned music to silent hotels , A.F.L. electricians pledged themselves not to install jukeboxes . As Petrillo , dressed in two-tone shoes and a cream-colored silk shirt , made the rounds of unmusical bars , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stalked him behind a glass of beer at Toots Shor 's non-union spot . <P> " I like one of Jimmy Durante 's jokes , " Petrillo grinned . " Jimmy says , ' Fellows listen to this here indignunt telegram I sent Putrilluh . I sure told him off . It reads Dear Mr. Putrilluh : Quote . Unquote . ' " <P> With or without quotes , Caesar Petrillo was sure that no one else would tell him off , until he got what he wanted . <P> <P> *In another column last week Pegler sought to expose F.D.R. 's capacity and taste in liquor . Wrote he : " The President drank Martinis ... a horror to all well-mannered drinkers . " Peg erred . F.D.R. was an Old-Fashioned man . Apropos his own bottle habits , Pegler , like a small boy writing on a blackboard , once repeated , for an entire post-New Year 's Day column , a pledge not to mix his drinks .                    @
