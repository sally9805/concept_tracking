Never before had Santa Claus worked so hard to give U.S. retailers a merry Christmas . Across the land merchants brought him into their towns , " straight from the North Pole , " in sleds , cars and by parachute . By last week , it looked as if Santa had been almost done to death . <P> In Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , several thousand children gathered at Stranahan Field to see Santa parachute from a plane hired by the Chamber of Commerce . As he floated down , the children screamed in terror ; a gust of wind wafted Santa onto some power lines nearby ( see cut ) . Unhurt , Santa was helped down , and began passing out candy . <P> In Gallipolis , Ohio , a Santa hired by local retailers parachuted for the town square , landed in the icy Ohio River . <P> In Chicago , the Santa of the merchants ' State Street Council was paraded on a float into Soldier Field between the halves of a professional football game . A group of jeering teenagers began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . As Santa exited , angrily shaking his fist , he moaned : " There 's a dead spot in my popularity-I just found it out . " <P> In a Chicago department store , Santa found that many moppets were fascinated by the ticking of his watch , decided to do even better . He buried an alarm clock in his stuffed paunch . All went well until the alarm went off , sent terrified children scampering across the floor . <P> In Asbury Park , N.J. , a mechanical laughing Santa in the window of Steinbach 's department store caught fire from a short circuit . While the smoke billowed through the window , his ghostly mechanical belly laugh could be heard ringing in the streets .
