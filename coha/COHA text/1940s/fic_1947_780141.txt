 | tents in the park and even right in the middle of the street , and they could hear the exciting strains of the steam organ on the merry-go-round . " Well , " Sam stretched and yawned , " I guess we 'll just leave that corn meal in the buggy until we need it . " " Sure , " said Jeremy . " We can pick that up when we come back to feed Bess . What do we do now ? " " Let 's go up to the Square first , " said Sam , " and kind of get the lay of the land . " Bill looked distastefully at the frazzled butt of his cigar and tossed it into the street . " Well , I tell you , boys , " he said , " we 're kind of on a tear , ai n't we ? Then I 'd say we 'd better fortify ourselves a little first thing off . I 'd say the thing to do first off is to go around the corner here to Schuman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer and maybe some free lunch or pretzels . " Bill 's full lips were red under his black mustache and he grinned knowingly . Jeremy looked at Sam . He was as eager as a small boy to hurry up to the Square and see what the carnival had to offer and Sam 's expression indicated the eagerness was mutual . " Wo n't be a thing doing for an hour or more , " Bill said . " They do n't get things working good until after dark and the sun 's just setting now . " " Well , " said Sam , " anything 's hunky-dory with me . " " Sure , " said Jeremy . This also would be an experience . He knew that Sam , any more than he , had never been inside of a saloon . He had tasted beer and had n't liked it , but he could down a glass in the interest of adventure . They walked three abreast around the corner and there was the script sign across the sidewalk  --  Schuman 's . And there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lugubriously chewing tobacco , was the lean six-feet-two figure of Henry Fisk , star pitcher of the Appian City baseball team .  | He was wearing bibless overalls , a striped denim shirt open at the throat and a cheap , yellow , stiff-brimmed straw hat . " Hi , there , Hank , " Jeremy called . Henry 's freckled face wrinkled into a modified grin and he spat across the sidewalk into the street . " Hi , sports , " he said . " In for a tear , huh ? " " Thou sayest it , " said Bill Lowney . " How 's the old pitching wing , Hank ? " Sam asked . " It 'd better be good a week from tomorrow because ? " " Wing 's all right , " said Henry Fisk , taking his right hand from his pocket and flexing the arm , " but far 's I 'm concerned there ai n't even going to be any game . " He looked at each one in turn , challengingly , then pushed the straw hat to the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jeremy demanded , " what you mean by that ? You Appian City guys going to crawl out of the game ? What you mean ? " " I mean , " said Henry Fisk evenly , " that I 'm going to be a lot of miles from here come a week from tomorrow . Do n't know about the rest of the team . Reckon they 'll play you all right and Joe Timms can twirl ' em good enough to keep you birds fanning the ozone . " " Wait a minute , " said Bill , " what 's this all about ? We 're just going into Herman 's for a schooner . It 's my treat and how about you joining us and telling what you 're talking about ? " Henry grinned and then sobered immediately . " Do n't mind if I do , " he said , " but I ca n't afford to return the treat and there ai n't much to tell . " " That 's all right , Hank , " said Bill , patronizingly taking him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Henry pushed himself away from the wall and fell in with them to enter Schuman 's swinging door and line up before the long bar . The plump , white-aproned bartender wore a black ,  | waxed mustache something like Bill 's and his hair was combed into an oily roach . " Hello , Herman , old sport , " Bill spoke jovially . " Hello , " said Herman , noncommittally . " Four schooners . " " Right . " On the walls were a Currier Ives print of an exciting sulky race and fighting pose portraits of John L. Sullivan , Jake Kilrain and Bob Fitzsimmons and across the room a large gilt-framed picture of a round-breasted , winsome lass who wore nothing but a filmy scarf across her lap while a pink-billed dove whispered something pleasant into her ear . This picture reflected in the great gleaming mirror behind the bar . Sam nudged Jeremy and indicated the picture . " Ever see anything like that before ? " he whispered . Jeremy grinned . " Nope , " he said . " Not since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge glass schooners at the tap and evening off the foam with a bone spatula . In the mirror the four of them were reflected  --  slim , dark , vitallooking Sam with his flimsy , black-visored " Dawn 's Pride " cap on the side of his head ; lanky , thin-faced , redheaded , Henry Fisk ; Jeremy himself , with his yellow hair showing under his farmer 's straw hat and his wide-set , round blue eyes and broad , sloping shoulders ; and last , pink-cheeked dudish Bill Lowney , making the rest of them seem like clodhoppers . For an instant Jeremy resented Bill and his dress but the resentment faded when Bill grinned at him in the mirror . Herman slid the brimming schooners along the bar and Bill laid down two dimes . " How about a little snack , Herman ? " Bill asked . " It 's down there to eat , " said Herman , nodding his head toward the lower end of the bar . " Let 's get something to nibble on , boys , " said Bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was a huge glass bowl of pigs ' feet , another covered bowl of sauerkraut and wieners , stacks of sliced rye and white bread , a jar of dill pickles , a dish pyramided with hard-boiled eggs , a juicy roast of beef , bowls of six-inch pretzels , a heap of sliced bologna sausage and salami , slabs of limburger and roquefort cheeses under glass bells , bottles of pepper sauce , and several types of mustard . Bill sliced himself a generous piece of beef with a longbladed knife , slapped the meat onto a piece of rye bread , daubed it with mustard , stuck another piece of bread on top of the mustard , forked up a dill pickle , which he placed on top of his sandwich , and helped himself to an egg . Jeremy and Sam followed his example exactly and so did Henry Fisk , except that Henry pasted a piece of bologna to the mustard before putting on the rye bread cover . Then they moved back to their beer . Jeremy took a sip and , catching sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face and bit into his sandwich . The mustard on the meat was piquantly hot . " Look , Herman , " said Bill , " why have n't you got a picture of Gentleman Jim up in here ? " " Corbett 's a has-been , " said Herman . He jerked a thumb at the portrait of the scrawny-legged Fitzsimmons . " I got a picture of Corbett 's boss . " Jeremy hoped it would n't be necessary to stay in the saloon long . He was itching to get up to the Square and see what excitements the carnival had to offer . Still , there was nothing boring about this glittering saloon . Henry Fisk was leaning one elbow on the bar , his long , thin jaw methodically and efficiently working on the beefand-bologna sandwich . Between each bite he took a capable draft from his schooner . There was beer froth on Bill Lowney 's waxed mustache.  | " That so-called knockout in Nevayda was an accident , " he proclaimed . Jeremy could see the maiden and dove painting in the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " All right , Hank , " said Sam , " what 's this business about your not going to pitch ? " Henry grinned around the lump of sandwich in his mouth , took a couple more chews and a swallow of beer . He wiped the froth from his lips with the back of the hand that held his sandwich . " Just leaving town , " he said . " Wo n't be here . " " Thought you worked on the Appian City Courier , " said Jeremy . " Hmm , " Henry breathed as he took another bite . " Quitting . " Herman was polishing a glass . " Yeah , " he said sarcastically , " Fitz 's solar-plexus punch is an accident . " " You got to admit , " said Bill , " that Jim was way ahead until he run into that freak punch . " Jeremy cracked his boiled egg and started to peel it . " I 'd think a newspaper job like that would be pretty good . " Henry laid the remainder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar . " A bastard of a job , " he said . " Call it an accident if you want to , " said Herman . " Or you might call it a catastrophe . " Henry looked into Jeremy 's eyes in the mirror . He seemed a little on the defensive . " I worked my tail off there for going on four years and what 'd it get me ? Nothing . " " Corbett 's no fighter , " said Herman , " and never was and never will be . He 's a dancing master . Excuse me . " Herman glided to the near end of the bar to wait on a derbied and mustached man whose weight of adam 's apple made up for his deficiency of chin . The man took bourbon  | whisky and said , " Well , Herman , it do n't look like McKinley 's got any more gumption than old Grover , does it ? " " I guess you 're right , " said Herman . " I see where those Spaniards murdered three hundred more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid a dime on the bar . Yep , ' he said , " and throwed ' em to the sharks . " He clucked his tongue sorrowfuly , shook his head and then darted out the swinging door . " There 's sure enough hell-fire in this mustard , " said Sam . " Well , Hank , you was learning the printing trade , was n't you ? " " Supposed to be , " said Henry glumly stacking his egg shell on the bar . " Sure , I learn to set a little type , but most of the time they keep me going eleven , twelve hours a clay feeding the Gordon job press or  --  feeding the flat-bed or the folder or sweeping up or washing rollers or delivering job printing with the hand cart or other nigger work . " " He licked John L. proper , did n't he ? " Bill demanded of Herman . " When Sullivan was so old and fat and slow he could n't catch Corbett to hit him . " " Good job , huh ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " " You ca n't lick a man you ca n't hit , " said Bill . Jeremy took another swallow of his bitter brew . " Well , " said Henry , " when I started in at the Courier old Mac gives me a big talk about opportunity and three iron men a week to start . In four years , he says , I 'll be a journeyman printer . " " Ruby Robert hit him right enough , " said Herman . " Laid him stiff with one punch . " " Two years ago , " said Henry , " he raised me to four bucks a week and now I 'm twenty-one years old and still getting the same . I tell old Mac I 'm supposed to be making anyhow ten or maybe twelve dollars a week after four years and he says , Yes , Hank , but you 're not a printer yet . You  | could n't hold down a journeyman 's berth in any newspaper anywhere . ' " " I still say it was an accident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay a glove on Corbett next time . " Henry said , " I say , Who 's fault is that ? You keep me so damn busy running errands and feeding presses I do n't hardly ever get a chance even to set body type , let alone set up ads or work on the stone . ' " Herman shrugged his shoulders . " If they ever match Fitz and Corbett again you can come in and say that with money . " Henry took a swallow of beer . " Well , McCutcheon says I 'm taking the wrong attitude . He says there 's nothing to keep me from coming to the office nights and practicing composition on account I 've got a key to the office and there 's always Courier copy hanging on the hook , both body and ads . He says there 's nothing to keep me from coming to the office on Sundays , if I did n't waste my spare time playing baseball and hanging around poolrooms . Well , to hell with McCutcheon . I quit my job tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Sam , who got four dollars a week working in the mill . " No , " said Jeremy , who got his board from Grandpa Bell and a dollar a week , which he usually put away in a stone jar . " I 'll say it with money all right , " said Bill . Henry looked first at Jeremy and then at Sam , lugubriously defiant . " I quit my job , " he said , " and I 'm leaving town tonight . " " All right , " said Herman , " you say it with money . Money talks . " " I 'll say it with money all right , " said Bill . " Well , look , Hank , " said Sam , " you ought to be able to get a better job in Appian City . You had n't ought to be obliged to leave town . "  | Henry took another bite from his sandwich . " Well , hell , " he said , " Appian City 's a dead hole anyhow . " Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazement and then said , " I guess if Appian City 's dead we 've been in the graveyard since before we was born and just did n't know it . " " This , " said Bill Lowney , " is the age of science and science wins in the long run . Corbett 's got brains and science and when it 's brains against muscle brains win every time . " " All right , " said Herman . " Then what happened in the fourteenth round in Carson City proves Fitz is the man with brains . " Herman laughed uproariously and then moved down the bar to serve a newcomer . " If you got a good job and a chance to amount to something , " said Henry gloomily , " it do n't matter where you are . The way I look at it , there 's nothing in Appian City for a young duck . I just made up my mind and I 'm going to hit out before I got a chance to change my mind . Damn if I 'm not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head in sage approval . " Flank 's right , " he said . " A thousand opportunities in a city like Chicago to one in a place like Appian and to half of one opportunity in Dawn 's Mill . If I had my life to live over I 'd never in the world stayed there . " Jeremy looked at Henry Fisk and was sorry Henry would not be pitching for Appian City . If Dawn 's Mill won they never could be sure it would have been the same with Henry on the mound . Likewise , defeat would be more bitter with Hank gone and fat Joe Timms pitching . Jeremy took a deep draught of his beer and it tasted better now . It was strangely disconcerting to hear anyone call the glittering Appian City a dead hole  --  especially with the excitements of the carnival just beginning to unfold . At any time Appian City had seemed full of traffics and  | alarms . It had seemed that if , by any remote chance , the varied life and movement of this city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could always go down to the railroad station and see the great railroad trains roar in and puff out bearing all manner of strange people from God knew where to God knew thence on God knew what mysterious missions . But there again , the railroad itself was symbolic . It stood for travel away from here to unknown places  --  food for the curious tingling hunger that was growing in him day by day , the strange inner fire that Grandpa Bell was trying to smother with argument . " Of course , " Bill Lowney was saying , " I have n't done so bad in Dawn 's Mill . I got my own shop and I 'm my own boss and all . But if I 'd gone to Chicago , for instance , I might own a shop with six chairs and be practically rich . " " Where you going , Hank ? " Jeremy asked and his throat seemed constricted and his voice husky . " Out in Kansas . " " Kansas ? " " Well  --  Kansas , Nebraska and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jeremy took a bite of his boiled egg . Now he did n't quite know whether to believe Henry Fisk or not , but he was conscious of his pulse accelerating . " Well , Hank , " said Sam , " I do n't know what you got in mind , but ? " Chewing on his sandwich , Henry looked down from his gangling height , grinned , and pushed the sawdust around with his toe . He laughed a little and then took a drink of beer . " Sure , " he said , " I reckon it 'd sound kind of crazy without you knew all about it , but I do n't think it 's crazy . Near 's I can see it 's the smart thing to do . " Sam looked at Jeremy , his swarthy face solemn , and shook his head .  | " Well , hell , " said Henry Fisk , self-consciously , " I 've gone this far and I reckon I might as well tell you about it . There was a tramp printer named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been every place ? out in Oregon and Boston and New Orleans and he had the damnedest bunch of stories to tell about knocking all around the country . Well , hell , at first of course I thought Pete Buchanan was just full of mush and then when I got to know him better I could see he was n't full of mush at all but stuck about as close to the truth as anybody at all does . Maybe he 'd stretch things just a little bit , but hell , so do preachers and most everybody whether they know they 're doing it or not . " Well , hell , this Pete Buchanan was a good printer but he 'd just work in printing offices in the fall and winter and early spring and would get out on the road in the summer time on account if you stick too close in a print shop it will kill anybody at all sooner or later . He made it a business to get into the harvest fields out west every year and work maybe up into Nebraska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvest fields , " said Bill Lowney . Henry Fisk took a swallow of beer and ran his tongue around inside his freckled cheeks . " Well , hell , " he said , " tough work makes a man out of you and they really pay you wages on account they need every man they can get . Two and a half , three and sometimes even three and a half a day and board . " Sam frowned . " A day or a week ? " " A day . Pete Buchanan says you get off the train in some little town way out in Kansas , maybe , and the farmers are down to the railroad waiting and they rush up and bid for you . He says one of ' em will call out , Here 's my wagon , friend . Take you right out to work and it 's two-fifty a day and board . ' Then another farmer will say , Do n't pay no attention to that skinflint . I 'm paying three dollars a day  | with three kinds of meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another farmer says , Get away from them misers , boy . I 'm paying three-fifty a day and paying off every night cash money and four big meals each and every day . ' " " My stars , " said Jeremy , " that do n't seem possible . " " Well , " said Henry , " I know it do n't until you hear all about it . There 's miles and miles of flat land without gulfs or hills or many trees and all of it in wheat . Thousands and thousands of acres all in wheat and you know wheat do n't wait . When it 's harvesttime you got to harvest it and you got to have men for the job . So there 's thousands of fellows make it a business every summer to start out in Kansas or Oklahoma Territory and work up , but even so there 's never enough men and a lot of wheat goes to waste . If you got say five hundred acres of wheat yourself and there 's ten thousand acres of wheat right in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to harvest two-thirds of the crop , you 're going to try and pay enough for harvest hands so you get your own crop in . " " That 's right , " said Bill Lowney . Sam shook his head . " A harvest hand sure could save himself some money . " " Save practically every cent you made , " said Henry . " That 's what I 'm figuring on . Say I get an average of three dollars a day . Say I work only thirty days . That 's ninety iron men in one month and deep down in your jeans pocket . " Sam whistled . " Wait a minute , Hank , " Jeremy objected . " Time you pay your passage on the steam cars way out there and back and then from one place to another , I do n't see how you 're going to have anything much left except a lame back . " " Ah . " Henry grinned around a mouthful of sandwich and held up one finger oratorically . " That 's just it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ride in the passenger trains , except maybe blind baggage . " " You mean you 're going to be a tramp ? " Sam asked .  | " Well  --  it ai n't really being a tramp . All the harvest hands travel on freight trains and the railroads expect it . That 's the only way the harvest hands have got to travel . They 've always done it that way and it 's all right with the railroads because if the harvest hands did n't get to the wheat fields there would n't be any harvest and the railroads would n't have the job of hauling the wheat to the elevators and flour mills . " Well , hell , Pete Buchanan was telling me the way it is . There 'll be gangs of a hundred or more harvest hands maybe just climb aboard a freight train and sit on top of the box cars riding across the country and the railroad men could n't do anything with that many stiffs even if they wanted to . " Henry took the last of his boiled egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How 's for another beer , you ducks ? " Jeremy looked at Sam . " Well , I do n't know , " he said . His face felt strangely drawn in the cheeks and his head was a little light . " Ought to have another just to wish Hank good luck , " said Bill . " After all , we 're on a tear , ai n't we ? You could do with another , could n't you , Hank ? " Henry looked at his empty schooner and grinned . " Maybe , " he admitted . " Sure , " said Sam , recklessly . " What the hell . This one 's on me . Fill ' em up , will you , mister ? " Jeremy emptied his schooner and Herman gathered in the empties while Bill , Sam , Henry and Jeremy repaired once more to the free lunch . " Hah , " said Bill , lifting the glass bell from the limburger cheese . " This is what we need this time . " Jeremy took a sniff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to eat that stuff ? " Bill calmly slapped a gob of limburger on a piece of  | rye bread . " Not a man yet , " he proclaimed , " until you like good old limburger . " " Never yet saw a turkey buzzard with whiskers , " said Jeremy . " Anybody who 'd eat that stuff 's a grave robber . " " Yeah , " said Sam , " shut the privy door . " Henry Fisk was making himself another beef sandwich and Jeremy watched him and wondered if Henry actually was going to do what he said , wondered if Henry actually would ride freight trains clear to the western harvest fields and make the money he said he could make . It all seemed incredible to Jeremy  --  one of the extravagant plans born of dissatisfaction which country boys always were working up and then dropping . Henry probably expected them to talk , him out of it so he could go back to work at the Courier Monday with better conscience . They returned to their replenished schooners and Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sip of his beer and it tasted a little better than the first . He looked up at the reflection of the bosomy damsel and dove and , while the room seemed strangely hazy , the picture appeared to be brighter colored and to have more of a third-dimensional quality . Suddenly he felt a growing sympathy and friendliness for Hank Fisk , the gangling demon pitcher of the Appian City Panthers . Hank Fisk had been the enemy to be beaten , if possible . Hank Fisk , chewing tobacco in the pitcher 's box , grinning sardonically last year when Jeremy had swung off his feet at Hank 's slow ball . Now doubt left him about Hank 's riding freight trains to the wheat fields . Now Jeremy knew Hank was serious and now Jeremy knew he 'd like to go along . This could be it . This could well be the answer . " What you take with you , Hank ? " Jeremy asked . " You take a grip , or would n't it be better to have a knapsack like a soldier ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam , " that tramps got to  | carry a bundle in a red bandana handkerchief on the end of a stick . " Henry was chewing on his new sandwich . " Do n't take anything , " he said , " except a razor and a piece of soap and a little comb and a little pocket mirror , if you got one . I got them all in my pockets now . " " Have n't you got a toothbrush ? " Bill Lowney asked , nibbling on his limburger . Henry grinned and looked down . " Just sissies and gaycats carry toothbrushes , " he said . " What 's a gaycat ? " Sam asked . " A greenhorn bo . " " What they call ' em that for ? " " Well  --  tell the truth I do n't know and Pete Buchanan did n't know either , but that 's what they call ' em  --  gaycats . And Pete Buchanan says when you 're on the road never let anybody get the idea you 're a gaycat . The blowed-in-theglass stiffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blowed-in-the-glass stiff ? " Jeremy asked . Henry took a drink of beer and grinned . " That 's a regular professional hobo tramp that just travels around the country and wo n't work at all unless he 's made to and begs at back doors and steals if there 's anything loose and handy . They go down south in the winter and north in the summer , or that 's what Pete Buchanan said . " " Was Pete Buchanan a blowed-in-the-glass ? " Sam asked . Henry shook his head . " Nope . Pete was a working stiff . " He grinned again . " That 's what I 'll be  --  a working stiff . The blowed-in-the-glass professional hoboes ai n't got much more use for a working stiff than for a gaycat but a working stiff do n't have much trouble with them on account the blowed-in-the-glasses keep away from harvest fields and out there the working stiffs travel in such big gangs they could take care of themselves . " Sam said , " You 're just going down here to the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb aboard ? " Henry nodded and then said , " Well , hell , I got it worked out a little better than that . There 's a westbound freight comes in a little before nine o'clock and goes on the side track to let the Cannonball go through at five minutes after nine . I 'll be listening and when the freight whistles for Miller 's crossing I 'll go down and get on the other side of the track from the depot . Then when the freight goes on the siding I 'll just walk down the side of her and pick out an empty box car and climb in and shut the door . " " Is it that easy ? " Jeremy asked . " Sure . Well , of course you probably have some trouble now and then this far from the harvest fields , but if you tell the brakemen where you 're going they probably wo n't make any fuss . " " Gosh , " said Sam , " I do n't know . " " Well , hell , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have some fun and excitement and what 's life for ? The way I look at it , there 's something more to life than working yourself to the bone in a God damn printing office . " " Sure . " Jeremy spoke with emphasis . Henry looked at Jeremy , looked his thanks for the words of approval . Then he took a drink of beer and looked at Bill Lowney and at Sam Brock . " Say , " he said , " why do n't you ducks just cut and come along with me ? We 'd have some sport . I tried to get some Appian City chumps to come along with me but they 're all deadheads . " Bill Lowney laughed and twisted his mustache . " Not for little Willie , " he said . " Well , hell , " said Hank , " I did n't expect you . What about you two ? " " By golly , Hank , " said Jeremy , " I 'd like to do it at that . " Bill laughed again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jerry , " he said . " Beer has n't got anything to do with it , " Jeremy  | blurted . " Just strikes me Hank has got some get-up-and-get to him . Going out that way you 'd see the country . You 'd see a lot more than just traveling on a passenger train or with a rig . " " See the inside of some good jails , " said Bill . " Well , I do n't know , " said Sam . " You might have some excitement . " " You bet your boots you might have some excitement , " said Jeremy . " Look , Sam  --  are you game ? " " Well , sure I 'm game if you are . But we could n't just go off this way . " " No , " said Jeremy . " Of course I could n't just run off tonight without telling my grandfather and grandmother . After all . What I mean , Hank can put it off two or three days . Well , say we come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ducks are just like the rest of ' em , " he said . " I 'm getting aboard the westbound freight at nine o'clock and I 'd like to see you ducks show some gumption and come along . " " The west bound freight will run again Monday night , wo n't it ? " Jeremy asked . " Not for me , it wo n't , " said Henry . " I know how it is because I 've seen it before . Stick around a while and put something off and then you never do it . But not this time for Henry . When that rattler pulls out tonight I 'm on it . " " If that 's the way you feel about it , " said Sam , " of course we ca n't stop you . " " Well , hell . " Henry took a swallow of beer . " I just know how it is . You go home and say , Maw , can I go be a hobo ? ' And your Maw says , What on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a hobo ! ' So here I am waiting for you . " " No , " said Jeremy firmly , " it 's not that way with me . I do n't have to ask can I go . Only thing , my grandfather 's been pretty damn good to me . So 's my grandmother . And it would n't be right and decent for me to go off to Kansas  | without telling ' em . Besides , I ai n't got enough spondulix with me . " " Do n't need much . " " Jerry 's right , Hank , " said Bill Lowney . " Well , he 's only half right because I think it 's a harum-scarum kid trick to go running off on a freight train anyhow . " " Columbus went off on a harum-scarum trip , " said Jeremy . " We 'll go with you , " said Sam , " if you wait until maybe Monday . " " Yeah , maybe . " " No , " said Jeremy . " Of course I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go with you I 'll go . " " Yeah , " said Henry . " You 'll go unless somebody talks you out of it . Well , hell . I been talked out of too many things myself and I stay around here two more days and something will happen . I just do n't trust things any more and I do n't trust myself and I do n't trust you ducks . " He laughed and looked from Jeremy to Sam . Jeremy drew a deep breath . He meant what he said but he also sensed truth in Henry 's position . " No , " Henry went on , " if you ducks come on with me now we 'll all go to Kansas and have a hell of a time and maybe make some money . Wait until Monday and none of us 'll go . Me , I 'm going tonight and nothing 's going to keep me . " They finished their beer and sandwiches and Bill Lowney said , " Well , boys , how about another ? " Sam pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , emphatically . " Look  --  we came up here to see the carnival so let 's see the carnival . " " Now look here , " said Henry . " You ducks say you 're game to go along with me but you ca n't go off without telling your folks good-bye . Why in hell ca n't Bill Lowney here tell your folks for you ? "  | Jeremy shook his head . " Nope , " he said . " That just would n't do for me , Hank . " " Me , either , " said Sam . Henry shrugged his lean shoulders . " That 's all there is to it then , " he said . " You go home and your folks 'll argue you out of it . " " Well , " said Sam , " if you 're all a-sweat to get going tonight we ca n't stop you . " " No , " said Jeremy , " if you 're so set on going alone we 'll see you out in Kansas . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about it when I get back . Maybe I 'll drop you a card from Kansas City or some place . Well , I ai n't got much more than a half hour before that rattler blows in and I think I 'll mosey down past the depot and get myself set on the other side of the switch track . Thanks for the beer , you ducks . Glad I run into you and sorry you wo n't come along and have some fun for yourselves . " " Wait a minute , " said Jeremy . " I 'd kind of like to see you get aboard that freight train . Mind if we come along ? " " It 's a free country , " said Henry . " I do n't own the railroad track or the streets . " Jeremy and Sam started toward the swinging door with Henry but Bill Lowney remained with his elbow hooked comfortably over the ridge of the bar . " Are n't you coming , Bill ? " Jeremy asked . " Guess not , " said Bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get back  --  if you do n't decide to go with Hank . " Sam looked at Jeremy and grinned with his black eyes squinted . " Good luck , Hank , " Bill said . " Thanks , " Hank drawled . " Maybe I 'll need it . "  | CHAPTER FIVE Jeremy and Sam walked slowly with Hank away from the business district where the noise of the carnival now was pronounced . " Well , " Sam said , " I reckon at last the carnival is really going . " " Yeah , " Jeremy said , " but we 'll see all of it we want . " Now Jeremy did n't care whether he saw any of the carnival . His mind was whirling with thoughts of Monday . He was going to do it  --  he surely was . " Well , hell , " said Henry , " you ducks do n't have to go see me on the train . If you want to see the carnival , I wo n't need any boosting to get into a boxcar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd just like to watch you get away . " They walked through the summer twilight and blackbirds gossiped sleepily in the luxuriant gloom of big elm trees . Lamps were being lit in some of the shaded houses . As in a Dawn 's Mill evening , there was the scent of flowers mingling with that of privies , but neither was so potent because Appian City matrons had not made a cult of floriculture and indoor plumbing was becoming popular in the better houses . They met one family group with three children chattering excitedly about the carnival and a block farther on two young men were marching awkwardly toward town with two red-cheeked , beruffled damsels . " Hey , Hank , " one of the men greeted , " how 's the old wing ? "  | " Fine and dandy , " said Henry . " Headed the wrong way , ai n't you , Hank ? " the other man asked . " Not to get away from that carnival , I 'm not , " said Henry . The quartette laughed and Sam looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hank had found the answer , and again he wished he could go tonight . But Monday would come soon enough . Monday would come . A block from the railroad station the residences ceased . On one side of the street was a weed-grown lot surrounding the low brick gasworks with the huge rust-red tank in the rear . On the other side of the street was a ramshackle frame saloon , a small weather-beaten kennel with a flamboyant sign reading " Railroad Lunch  --  Quick Orders , " and a big yellow dolorous box of a building with a sign reading , " Star Hotel  --  Rooms 750 , $1 . " Henry jerked his head toward the hotel . " That there 's a whorehouse , " he remarked . Sam and Jeremy stared at the stark windows upstairs and downstairs and dismal yellow shades were drawn like cataracts over each one . " No josh , " said Sam . " You ever been in there ? " Henry sniffed . " If I had , " he said , " I would n't admit it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say a man 'd have to be pretty hard up . " " Yeah , " said Sam . " Do n't see how a fellow could get that low . What they charge ? " " Dollar , I guess . Anyhow I guess that 's the standard price everyplace . There 's that song , Eighteen nickels and a rusty dime . ' " " Dollar to the woman , " said Jeremy , " and about ten dollars to the doctor . " " Only , " said Sam , " they tell me they never really get cured up . " " Funny thing , " said Jeremy .  | " Well , hell , " said Henry . " You take me and I work hard all week for four dollars . It costs me anyhow three-fifty to live , counting chewing tobacco , and if I did n't spend anything for anything else at all I could be a dollar ahead in two weeks . Well , hell , the way I look at it , it just ai n't worth spending that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old blister . " " God , no , " said Sam . " Well , if it was really some sweet potato that might be kind of different . " " There ai n't no sweet potatoes in a place like that , " said Henry gloomily . " Only thing , " observed Jeremy , " when you get married you would n't want your wife to have been puntanging around with other ducks . Looks to me like you got to consider that and what 's fair for one ought to be fair for another . " " Now , " said Henry , " that 's just bosh and Sunday School talk . Everybody who knows about those kind of things knows there 's a difference . A man can puntang around when he 's young and no harm done unless he catches something , but you take a woman and let her start and she 's a chippy from then on and no stopping her . " " Well , " said Jeremy , " I do n't know . " " Trouble is , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge and he ca n't resist a sweet potato , but a woman has n't got the urge at all and do n't even like it . You take a woman and the only reason she ever does it is to do some duck a favor or to make money or on account she wants some children . " " That 's right , " said Sam . " Well , " said Jeremy , " I do n't know . Seems like to me you 're wrong one way or the other . You say the only reason a woman ever does it is to be good to some duck and then you say if she ever starts puntanging around there 's no stopping her . I do n't know , but it looks to me like anybody could stop doing something they did n't want to do . "  | Henry shook his head . " Women just have n't got any will power , " he said . " Do n't need any will power if they do n't like it , " said Jeremy , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being habit-forming to be a Good Samaritan . " " Look , Jerry , " said Sam with an air of great patience , " what Hank 's getting at is that if a man sows his wild oats when he 's young he ai n't so apt to when he 's married and middle-aged . " " Yeah , " said Jeremy , " I see what you 're getting at now . If a man puntangs around before he 's married he wo n't do it after he 's married because he likes it and he ca n't resist a sweet potato but if a girl puntangs around before she 's married she 'll be a chippy all her life because she do n't like it . " " Well , hell , " said Henry . The red globe of the station semaphore lantern glowed like an ominous star against the darkening sky and lights shone yellow from the depot windows . Down the track a switch signal glinted green on the shining rails . They passed the black hulk of the water tank and there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could hear the sharp metallic clatter of the station agent 's telegraph sounder coming from his open window . Also , from far away the breeze occasionally brought a few faint weewawing strains from the carnival 's merry-go-round organ . " Just once more , Hank , " said Jeremy , " why ca n't you put it off until Monday ? " " Nope , " said Henry , shaking his head . " This is the night . " They climbed the cindery bank beyond the long switch track and sat down in the coarse grass . Above the treetops and beyond Appian City , Venus burned bright in the pale western sky . The breeze was cool and comfortable through Jeremy 's faded blue shirt . There was the smell of excite-  | ment in the air . Jeremy pulled up a stem of timothy and bit the tender root . " What I 've been trying to get at all the time , " he said , " is I think it 's pretty silly for anybody to hold something against somebody else when he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jerry , " said Henry , " I think you should ought to come along with me . When you get around more you 'll see things different . You just been listening to too many Sunday School teachers . You got to learn about the world . " " Sure , " said Sam , nudging Jeremy with his elbow . " You 're right and you 're wrong , " said Jeremy . " I want to get out and see the world . And I 'm going Monday . I know I got a lot of things to learn but I think I 'm right about this . I know I 'm right . " From off in the evening , but surprisingly close , came the piercing cry of a steam locomotive whistling for a crossing  --  two long blasts , a short and another long . " My gosh , " said Sam , " here she comes . " " Yep , " said Henry , huskily . But he did n't move . " All right , Jerry , " said Sam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up to the carnival did n't you think maybe you 'd pick up some Appian City sweet potato that knew of a good haymow some place ? " Henry laughed softly . " Well , I do n't know , " said Jeremy . " But if you did , you would n't fight her off very hard , would you ? " " Do n't know what I 'd do , " said Jeremy . " Reckon it 'd depend on a lot of things but I sure enough do n't hold that a girl 's got to behave better than a boy just because she 's a girl . " From around the bend down the track came the round yellow headlight of a locomotive and again the shriek of the whistle and then the steady chuf-chuf-chuffety-chuff of a freight engine . The puffing slowed and finally stopped . Then  | in the glow of the headlight they saw the dark figure of a man tugging at the switch lever . He signaled with a lantern , swinging it in a circle , and the locomotive puffed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the switch track , approached them , and they felt the heat of the engine 's boiler in their faces and heard the hissing of steam and caught a glimpse of the engineer 's red face and red neckerchief as he leaned from the cab window and the engine was puffing very slowly but powerfully and the bell was ringing casually and then the tender piled high with coal was by them and a brick-red boxcar with white lettering and numbers and another and another and a flat car loaded with lumber and another boxcar and the brakes rasped and sighed and the westbound freight came to a stop on the siding . Henry pulled himself to his feet , grinning . " Well , hell , " he said , " you ducks better change your mind and come along . " Jeremy expelled his breath . " No use going over all that again , " he said . " You know how it is . Wish you 'd wait until Monday , but if you wo n't , well I just wish you good luck and maybe Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A brakeman carrying a lantern trotted over the tops of the cars toward the rear of the train . Henry rubbed his hands together . " Got to wait until that bird 's out of sight , I guess . Well , if you ducks ai n't going to come along , suppose you stay up here so nobody sees you and gets suspicious . " " All right , " Sam said , tensely . " Good luck to you , Hank . " Henry 's voice was little more than a whisper . " Well , guess I 'll slide on down and see can I find an empty boxcar . So long , you ducks . " " So long , Hank , " said Jeremy . Jeremy and Sam , sitting with their legs hanging over the bank watched Henry 's gangling form slip down and  | heard his feet crunching in the cinders as he moved furtively along the train . A dozen cars down the line they saw him stop , wave a long arm and then climb up and disappear . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yep , " said Jeremy . " Like to be going along , " said Sam . " Yeah . But we could n't do that without telling our folks . " " No . But we 'll be doing it ourselves Monday . " " Yeah . " For a minute they said nothing . Then the locomotive safety valve popped and the world was enveloped in the roar of escaping steam . Sam and Jeremy both scrambled to their feet and backed up in apprehension and Sam shouted something which Jeremy could n't catch . Then there was another and even louder roar , a violent flashing of lights behind the boxcars , a cloud of acrid smoke and a shower of hot cinders and a multiple whoosh-whooshwhoosh as the eastbound Cannonball Express thundered through Appian City . In half a minute the red lights on the rear car were bouncing around the curve down the track and the diminishing whistle was shrilling its signal for Miller 's Crossing . Then the freight locomotive safety valve ceased its uproar and the world was so silent that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Sam , looking at Jeremy . " I do n't wonder that horses run away . That all scared the bejesus out of me , even . " " Gosh , " said Jeremy , " I never saw anything like that Cannonball . Why , it must have been going a mile a minute . " The freight engine bell began to ring , then the whistle whooped deafeningly , the exhaust blasted and the train began to move forward . Jeremy saw the dark arm of the sernaphore swing down and the red globe disappeared to be replaced by green . The wheels clicked over rail joints and  | Jeremy and Sam , looking down from the bank , trying to pick out the box car into which Henry Fisk had disappeared , suddenly saw him dimly through a foot-wide opening between jamb and sliding door . His stiff straw hat was on the back of his head and he waved one long arm at them . Then he was gone and , with increasing momentum , dull-sided boxcars and gondolas flitted by and the locomotive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the double-ended switch track and the accelerating exhaust became a drum roll and the caboose with shirt-sleeved conductor lolling in the high , dimly lit cupola bounded past them . Then there was only the sting of soft coal smoke in their nostrils and the winking green lights on the caboose flipping out on the main track and the whooping whistle now far down the line . A bat darted crazily past them and over the roof of the station . " Jesus , " said Sam , softly . " Well , " said Jeremy , " he did it . He sure enough did it . " And dimmer and dimmer off from the west came the **26;460;TOOLONG of the engine and again its lonesome whistle . Once more then they could hear the click of the station agent 's telegraph sounder and then again the mournful weewaw of the merry-go-round up on the town square . They slid down the bank and crossed the switch track and the main track , angling toward the depot . " I reckon , " said Sam , " we better go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the carnival . " " I suppose so , " Jeremy said apathetically.  | CHAPTER SIX When they had walked a block past the Star Hotel and Railroad Lunch and saloon and gasworks they heard the freight train 's whistle once more , now far off into the night . " There she goes , " Jeremy said sadly . " Yeah , " said Sam . " Well , I suppose she 'll be going that way all night long . Suppose she 'll be going like that even after we 're home asleep , going through God knows what towns , and old Hank maybe asleep in that old boxcar . " " Yeah . And getting out tomorrow morning in some town maybe a couple of hundred miles away and buying himself some breakfast in an eating house and then getting on another train . " " Hank 's a good duck , " said Sam . The arc lamps were on now , sputtering their lavender pools of light at alternating street intersections , each surrounded by a worshipful court of junebugs . " At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Jeremy . " Neither did I. Old Hank 's got plenty of nerve to go off that way by himself . " " Well , if he can do it alone we can do it together all right . " " Sure . " " It 'd been pretty dirty for me to go away like that without telling my grandfather and grandmother . " " I could n't either . Guess Hank has n't got anybody to worry about him . "  | " No , " said Jeremy . " I do n't know too much about Hank , but his father 's a drunk , I hear , and do n't pay much attention to Hank and his mother 's either dead or gone away . " " You know what I 'd do if I was in Hank 's place ? " Sam said . " I think I 'd join the Navy . " " That 'd be all right after while . But this idea of going out to the harvest fields and making a pocketful of spondulix is the smartest thing first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were within a block of the Square  --  not only the strident song of the merry-go-round , but the unintelligible , cacophony of barkers ' voices rising above the crowd noises and the ringing of bells and occasionally a shrill little steam whistle . The whole Square was a blaze of flickering light from scores of gasoline torches augmenting the permanent arc lamps , and the light reflected on the bright pennants strung above the striped tents and on the faces and varicolored clothing of people milling around the brick-paved streets . " Gosh , " Sam said , " how in hell will we ever find Bill Lowney in this congregation ? " Jeremy laughed . " Well , he wo n't go home without us , I guess , and we can meet him back at the buggy . " " If we can find the buggy . " " We can find the buggy all right . " On their street , just off the Square , a crowd was gathered around a landau lighted by two gasoline torches . The top was down and seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up to ridiculous proportions . He held a banjo on his lap . Standing before a portable lectern and facing the rear of the landau was a tall , slim gentleman with curly black whiskers , frock coat and high silk hat . Jeremy and Sam pushed up to the edge of the crowd and the gentleman was urging a ragged-haired boy in overalls to climb up from the crowd . The boy finally complied , grinning stupidly.  | " Now , my boy , " said the gentleman , " what 's your name ? " " John , " said the boy . " A very good name indeed , " said the gentleman . " You were named for the Apostle John , I presume . " " No , " said the boy . " I was named for my mother 's Uncle John on account he had money but it did n't do no good because he got married again to a young filly and left all his tin to her . " The crowd guffawed . " Well , John , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose you live here in Appian City ? " " Nope , " said the boy . " I live in Dawn 's Mill . " That reply also brought a roar of laughter from all except Jeremy and Sam , who looked at each other . " That kid 's a liar , " Sam whispered . " He do n't live anywhere near Dawn 's Mill . I never saw him before . " " Yeah , " said Jeremy . " Now , John , " said the gentleman , " you do n't like to be hurt , do you ? " " Of course not . " The boy edged away apprehensively . " Well , I did n't suppose you did . Most bright boys do n't like to be iiurt . What do you do when you get hurt ? " " I holler . " " Of course you do . Now , John , how 'd you like to have a bright , shiny fifty-cent piece to spend at the carnival ? " The boy grinned . " Fine and dandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodkin and held it up for the crowd to see . " All right , John , " he said , " for a bright and shiny fifty-cent piece to spend at the carnival , would you let me prick your arm a little with this pin ? " The boy shook his head dubiously and edged away so far that he nearly fell from the landau . The crowd howled at that . The gentleman smiled appreciatively . " Do n't be afraid of me , my boy , " he said . " I would n't hurt you for the world .  | But you ought to be willing to let me prick your arm just a little teeny bit for a half a dollar . " The boy frowned . " Would it bleed ? " he asked , anxiously . The gentleman joined the crowd in their laughter . " Tell you what I 'll do , John , " he said . " If it bleeds one drop I 'll give you a dollar instead of fifty cents . And I 'll give you an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Reaching into his trousers pocket , the gentleman brought out a handful of coins and let half dollars clink down to the lectern , glittering in the torchlight . " All right , " said the boy , " it 's a deal . " He fumbled with the left sleeve button of his cheap , striped shirt . The gentleman helped him and rolled up the sleeve over the boy 's thin , white arm . " Ai n't going to hurt now , " the boy shrilled . " You promised . " " Just the tiniest prick , " soothed the man , and seizing up the bodkin , touched the boy 's arm with the point . " OUCH ! " yelled the boy , grasping his arm with his right hand and dancing up and down . " Ouch ! That did too hurt . Gosh ! " " Let me see it , " the gentleman demanded , taking hold of the boy 's wrists and pulling the protecting hand away . " Just as I thought . Not a single drop of blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does , " the boy declared , frowning up through his mop of tow hair . " All right , I 'll fix it . " The man reached over with a finger to an open can , got a dab of a substance of the consistency of axle grease . " Ladies and gentlemen , " he said , " I shall now apply a small amount of Dr. Murray 's Original Indian Painkiller Salve to alleviate what little discomfort resulted from this superficial pin prick . " Jeremy was thinking  --  any train , even a freight train ,  | runs faster than a good trotter . Right now it might be farther away from Appian City than Dawn 's Mill . The gentleman was rubbing the salve on the boy 's arm . " Does it hurt now ? " he asked . " Nope , " said the boy . " Well , it did n't hurt very much in the first place , did it ? " " Course it did . " The gentleman smiled and handed the boy one of the half dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a show of biting it to see if it was good . In the laughter that followed a middle-aged farmer said to Jeremy , " I tell you that boy 's pretty sharp . Nobody 's going to hornswoggle him much . " " He your boy ? " Jeremy asked , pointedly . " Him ? Oh , no . Never seen him before , but he says he 's from Dawn 's Mill . " The boy in the landau made a move to climb down but the gentleman took him by the arm . " Just a moment , John , " he said . " I 'm not quite through with you yet . You 're not in a hurry , are you ? " " Well , I got a half dollar here that 's itchin ' a mite . " " It 'll be just as good a couple of minutes from now . Well , ladies and gentlemen , I think you 'll all agree that this boy is more than ordinarily sensitive to pain . From the way he took on when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle , I think you 'll agree that he 's easily hurt . But a small dab of Dr. Murray 's Original Indian Painkiller Salve stopped his pain immediately . Now , with the young man 's permission , I want to make another demonstration . " " You ai n't going to stick me again , " the boy protested . " I 'm not going to hurt you again . But I 'm going to give you two more half dollars for just one more minute of your valuable time . Is that agreeable ? " The gentleman reached over to the lectern and held up two shiny half dollars .  | " You promise you wo n't hurt like the other time ? " " I promise . Now I want you to turn your head the other way so you do n't see what I do , but I will tell the ladies and gentlemen out there that I am going to rub a little more of Dr. Murray 's Original Indian Painkiller Salve on your arm  --  so . Now , John , turn your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The boy turned his head obediently and the gentleman , quickly taking up the bodkin , pushed the head with his thumb until the bodkin seemed to be driven half its length into the boy 's arm . The boy did n't wince . Then the gentleman took the bodkin between thumb and forefinger and , apparently with some effort , drew it from the flesh . Still the boy continued looking over his shoulder at the Negro who was making grimaces at him . " Well , John , " said the gentleman , " I have n't hurt you yet , have I ? " " Nope . " " Then , my boy , I 'll never hurt you . Let me rub just a little more of Dr. Murray 's Original Indian Painkiller on your arm . . . . Now , John , here 's your dollar and here 's a free box of Dr. Murray 's Original Indian Painkiller to take home to your mother and father and tell them that when that 's gone they 'll be able to buy more at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never want to be without it . " The boy , grinning , rolled down his sleeve , dropped his two new half dollars clinking into his pocket and climbed out of the landau . " Thank you , John , " said the gentleman with a patronizing chuckle in his voice . " Now , ladies and gentlemen , you have witnessed one small exhibition of the miracles Dr. Murray 's Original Indian Painkiller performs . I am a physician myself , but I must confess scarcely a day passes that I am not amazed anew at the miraculous qualities of this wonderful salve which Dr. Murray obtained personally from Chief Spotted Elk , famous medicine man of the Cheyenne  | Indians , after Dr. Murray had saved the life of Chief Spotted Elk 's daughter when she had been bitten by that scourge of the desert , the dread Gila monster . " This salve was a close-kept secret of the Cheyenne Indians and their braves used to rub the miraculous salve over their bodies before going on the war path or before hunting the dread grizzly bear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferring this boon upon Dr. Murray , Chief Spotted Elk exacted but one promise  --  that Dr. Murray not reveal the secret to any enemies of the Cheyennes , and this promise has been scrupulously kept . I take it for granted there are no enemies of the Cheyennes in Appian City  --  no members of the Arapaho or Pawnee tribes . " The crowd laughed and looked at one another . Scanning his audience , the gentleman singled out a wooly-headed Negro boy and pointed his finger at him like a pistol . " You , my friend  --  you 're not a member of the Arapaho or Pawnee tribes , are you ? " " No , suh , " said the boy . " I 'm a member of the Tribe of Benjamin at the Afro-American Baptist Church . " " Very well , young man , and I congratulate you . Now I am employed by Dr. Murray to travel through the country and make the citizens of our glorious United States acquainted with the miraculous nature of his Original Indian Painkiller by giving cans of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gentleman held one long forefinger aloft . " But , under terms of Dr. Murray 's agreement with Chief Spotted Elk , I must not bestow any of the Original Cheyenne Indian Painkiller to members of the Arapaho or Pawnee tribes . " Now you people of Appian City know as well as I do that the best way to make a man dishonest is to suspect him , that the best way to make him honest is to trust him . I trust you people and I 'm going to put you on your honor . I am going to ask if there are any Arapaho or Pawnee Indians among you to please hold up your hands so that I sha n't  | betray Dr. Murray 's sacred trust or my own by giving you any of the miraculous salve . No hands ? That 's all I ask . That 's how I trust you . I know if there were indeed an Arapaho or Pawnee Indian among you and he , by keeping his silence , secured something which he was not entitled to , he forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall now proceed to give you absolutely free introductory and advertising cans of Dr. Murray 's remarkable Original Indian Painkiller Salve . But I have devised a plan to keep the painkiller out of the hands of deadbeats , children and people who might misuse it . You have had a demonstration of its efficacy . What your eyes see your heart must believe and you must agree that any substance which performs the miracle you have seen it perform would be cheap even at five dollars a can . You must agree also that every home should have at least two cans on hand at all times ? one perhaps in the house and one in the barn . Accidents can happen anywhere and they never give you warning . " So  --  to each and every person who is willing to show his good faith by paying me not five dollars or even one dollar , but fifty cents , four bits or half a dollar for a can of Dr. Murray 's Original Indian Painkiller , I will give him another can absolutely free . The supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose this unparalleled opportunity . My assistant , Sambo , now will pass among you and it will be first come , first served . Fifty cents for a can of Dr. Murray 's Original Indian Painkiller and another box absolutely free . " Sam took hold of Jeremy 's arm . " Look , " he said , seriously , " that would n't be bad stuff to have around . You put in two bits and I 'll put in two bits and then we 'll have a box apiece . " " All right , " said Jeremy . He fished up a quarter and gave it to Sam and when the Negro with the enormous made-up mouth came elbowing through the crowd intoning , " Right here  --  Dr. Murray 's marvelous and miraculous In-  | than Painkiller , " Sam handed him two quarters and received two tin cans . There was no reluctance on the part of the crowd . Taking the gentleman 's word that the supply was limited , they almost mobbed the Negro in their eagerness to force their money upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jam and looked at their flat tin cans . The labels were printed smudgily with purple rubber stamp ink ? " Dr. Murray 's Original Indian Painkiller Salve . Price 75 cents . " " We got a bargain there all right , " Sam said . " That 's six bits for one box and we got two boxes for four bits . " A saturnine , scrawny man in early middle-age spat noisily through a gap in his front teeth . " Fake , " he said . " How you make that out ? " Jeremy asked . " I work in the Grand Hotel . Today chambermaid picked up three empty axle grease cans from that jasper 's room . " " Well , " said Sam , " I do n't see that makes him a fake . He could just use axle grease to hold the Indian herbs and things that makes it work . " The man spat again . " He could do that . But it ai n't necessary . He can sell the plain axle grease just as good , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worth of axle grease in a half penny 's worth of cans and sell it for four bits . Pretty good . " " Well , I do n't know , " said Jeremy . " It 'd look like the law would get him . " " No law against shearing sheep . " " There is , " said Jeremy , " if you do n't own the sheep . Anyhow the stuff sure worked good on that boy . " The man 's face wrinkled into a sarcastic grin . " He never stuck any needle into that boy . That was just a slick trick . Anyhow the kid 's a play actor that travels along with the man . Guess the kid 's the man 's son  --  anyhow they 're staying at the same room in the hotel . "  | " Oh , well , " said Sam , putting his can into his overalls pocket . " This stuff 'll come in handy anyhow . " " Yeah , " said the man , " if you got any axles to grease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two simpering middle-aged women wearing black masks and sunbonnets awkwardly threw handfuls of confetti into their faces . Sam turned and looked at the broad retreating backs . " That 's confetti , " he said . " Well , " said Jeremy . He swept some of the bright discs from his shoulder and looked at them . " They buy that , eh ? " " Think we ought to go back to the buggy and get our corn meal ? " Sam asked dubiously . " Well , " said Jeremy , " let 's wait a little bit and see what there is to see . " On the corner was a striped booth lighted by gasoline torches where a group was watching a couple of young men trying to throw small colored wooden rings over an array of prizes back on the board . There were frail , painted canes in great quantity and a number of knives stuck into racks . The lugubriously bored barker was automatically urging onlookers to step up and win a prize they could take home and treasure  --  three rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded in putting a ring over the head of a red cane and the barker passed the pine stick to the victor to the applause of the onlookers . " Would n't mind getting one of those stag-foot hunting knives , " Sam said to Jeremy . " Yeah , " said Jeremy , " but it looks like to me the handle is too big for the ring to go over . " " They would n't do that , would they ? " Sam frowned . " That 'd be cheating . Anyhow it 's only a nickel and I 'm going to try it . " He edged in and took the place of the young man who had won the cane . A sudden breeze fluttered the torches , throwing nervously shifting black shadows across the faces , and Jeremy caught a pungent whiff of gasoline fumes . He  | thought of Henry Fisk racing through the night in his boxcar . The barker had scores of wooden rings on a cane and lie began to slide off approximately a dozen . " How many , chappie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . " Sam gave him a nickel , took the rings , assumed a firm stance and carefully pitched a ring at one of the stag-foot hunting knives . The ring hit the handle too far down and bounced off . " You get everything you ring , " said the barker , monotonously . Sam 's second ring hit on the black hoof , whirled and dropped down into the gutter . " Say , " he demanded , " will these here rings fit over one of those hunting knife handles ? " " Well , bud , " said the barker , " if everybody got a three dollar knife for a nickel I could n't stay in business long . The better the prize , the better you got to throw . You need practice . Maybe if you threw fifty rings you 'd learn how . But maybe you 'll be lucky next time . " Sam threw his last ring and missed the knife altogether . " How many this time ? " demanded the barker . Sam shook his head and turned around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd . " I could have got one of them damn canes if I wanted , " he said . " You need a cane , " said Jeremy . There was a sudden commotion half a block down the street and they broke into a run to see a red-bearded policeman in a high gray helmet , hauling a farmer boy by the shirt collar and menacing him with his billy . " Going to be no rowdying on these streets , " the policeman announced for all to hear . " You 'll just come along with me to the calaboose . " " Aw , let him go , " a man called . " He did n't know no better . "  | " You want to come along with him , do you ? " the policeman demanded . The man did n't answer . " What 'd he do to get arrested ? " Jeremy asked the man .. " Aw , he just throwed some flour on a gal and her man got het up over it . They made up a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reckon the carnival paid ' em to make the law on account they sell the con-fetti in striped sacks for a nickel . " " I guess , " said Sam , " that we 'll just leave that corn meal in the buggy . " There was a hot and delicious smell of popcorn in the air nearby and the smell of frying hamburgers with onions and of peanuts and of sweat and sachet powder and cigar smoke and canvas and dust and horse manure . The popcorn wagon was in the street in the row of concession tents  --  glass glittering in the torchlight and a mechanical clown in a yellow domino grinned perpetually as he turned the cylindrical popper round and round , and the whistle of the peanut roaster shrilled its persistent summons .. Jeremy and Sam joined the throng marveling at the lifelike action of the clown for a moment and a man said , . " Well , that 's pretty good all right , but they had one at the World 's Fair where a regular little Corliss engine turned the business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sack of popcorn and Jeremy bought a sack of peanuts and then they moved on . Jeremy wondered what Grandpa would say . Well , he 'd tell Grandpa he was going anyhow . An occasional boy or young man was armed with small feather dusters to poke into girls ' faces . The girls would giggle shyly or reply with a handful of confetti . Other young men had rubber return-balls  --  soft rubber balls tied to long strings of India rubber  --  with which they could pop girls from behind and the rubber band would snap the ball neatly back into their hands .  | The possibilities of that implement of carnival spirit appealed to Sam and he bought one from a sidewalk vendor for fifteen cents . " well , " said Jeremy , " I do n't knotted the end of the rubber band to his middle finger and just then a buxom , red-cheeked girl of about twenty passed with an older woman . Sam quickly let drive with a sidearm motion and hit the girl smartly in the sitting portions . " Owl " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering . " All right , smarty , " she cried and dove for Sam . She wrested the ball from his hand before Sam could move and broke off the rubber band . " How 'd you like that , Mr. Smart-alec ? " she demanded . " Oh , come on , " said Sam . " Ca n't you take a joke ? " " Sure , " said the damsel . " Can you ? " Then she slapped him smartly on the face , turned and joined the older woman . Sam 's Dawn 's Pride cap fell to the sidewalk and the girl was gone before he could retrieve it . An old man with a long white beard whittled his finger at Sam and called out in a falsetto , " Oh-ho , young feller . Did you ever get left ? Did you ever get left ? " Sam picked up his cap , pulled it down over his eves , took a handful of popcorn , threw it into his mouth and said nothing . Jeremy cracked a peanut and dumped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I guess that was considerable fun but I do n't know that it was fifteen cents ' worth of fun . I 'd say it was n't maybe more than ten cents ' worth of fun . " " Aw , bugs , " said Sam . They started down the street toward the merry-goround . " Where , " asked Jeremy , " are all these gals with their hame straps loosened ? " " Have some popcorn , " said Sam . " Sure . Have some peanuts . "  | " Well , wait a minute . Hold my popcorn . " There was about two feet of rubber band still tied to Sam 's middle finger and , as Jeremy held his popcorn , he peeled it off and rolled it up . " I 'll save that , " he said . " It 'll come in handy for something . " " Yeah , " said Jeremy , " you could hang a jumping jack on it if you had a jumping jack . " The popcorn was crisp and savory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peanuts and looked at passing girls . The passing girls did not look at them . Then they were in front of a show with a huge , garish banner of a two-headed calf gamboling on a very green pasture and the red and yellow sign told how scientists were baffled at this extraordinary freak of nature . The barker was urging one and all not to miss this opportunity of a lifetime when the price of admission was only a dime , ten cents , the tenth part of a dollar , and it would be something they could tell their grandchildren about in years to come . Jeremy was not impressed . " Hell , " he said , " I know about those things . They 're dead and stuffed , and the animal stuffer just takes two calves ' heads and sews ' em onto one body . " " Sure , " said Sam . " Just a damn fake . " Scornfully , they pushed by the crowd . A drunken farmer was pretending to sow a field with confetti from a small striped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I want to ride on the merry-go-round again , " and his father said , " Now hush or I wo n't ever bring you to town any more . " Jeremy thought of Henry Fisk roaring through the night in his boxcar . " Wonder if Bill Lowney 's still in that saloon ? " Sam said . " Be pretty drunk by now . Wonder if he ever got around to give old Bess her oat bag ? " " Say . You know I think we 'd better go to the buggy and look after that , " said Sam .  | They turned , still eating their popcorn and peanuts , and found their way back to the buggy . Not only were the two sacks of corn meal untouched , but so was the nose bag . Jeremy took the bit from the mare 's mouth and hung the bag over her nose . She ate hungrily . " Well , " said Sam , " while she 's gobbling her oats we might go around the corner and see if Bill 's still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's still there we better dodge him until we 're ready to go home . If lie 's drunk he 'd be a pest . " At Schuman 's saloon Sam gingerly pushed the swinging doors and they peeked inside , Jeremy craning his neck over Sam 's shoulder . The bar was pretty well crowded by now and two strange bartenders were at work . But Bill Lowney was not in the line of patrons . " Well , that 's good , " said Jeremy . " Yeah . But there 's other saloons in town . Well , we 'll run into him somewhere and we can go back and see the rest of the carnival . " " Only thing , " said Jeremy , " the more money we spend at the carnival the less money we 'll have Monday when we start out for Kansas . " " Yeah . But a few dimes wo n't make much difference one way or the other . " " Well , a dime 'll buy a loaf of bread and a can of sardines . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be much interested in this damn carnival any more . I keep thinking about old Hank chugging along in that boxcar . " Sam nodded . " I know . I 'm doing the same thing . " " That 's the real thing . That 's excitement and adventure and no mistake . This stuff seems all imitation and fake now , like that fake two-headed calf . I do n't know , but it just seems like these people are n't really having such a hot time . It just seems like they 're only pretending to have a hot time because they think they should ought to be . " " Yeah , " said Sam . " But we have n't seen near all of it  | yet and we 're here and we ca n't go home for hours so we better see what there is to see . We ca n't just go sit in the buggy and wait for Bill to show up . " " I guess not . Wonder where Bill 's at ? " " No telling . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I wonder . " They had finished the popcorn and they had finished the peanuts and they wandered back to the square , circling to the left this time instead of to the right . There was a booth with a washtub full of a pale liquid upon which floated thin slices of lemon , and an array of damp and battered tin cups on the counter , and a barker crying , " Ice cold lemonade  --  all you can drink for a nickel . " And they passed that by . There was a deep booth with three rows of black-faced dolls on spindles in the rear and a group of people watching two young men throw baseballs at the dolls while the barker yelled , " Step right up , you ball players . Three balls for a nickel . Hit two nigger babies out of three and get a see-gar . " " You could do that easy , " said Sam . " Maybe , " said Jeremy . " You want a cigar ? " " ti'ell  --  I guess not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do n't want any cigar . " There was a booth where black-looking hamburgers sizzled in grease over a gasoline stove and the hot odor of beef and onions drew them inexorably forward to part with a nickel apiece for hamburgers on buns . Of course they had eaten their suppers before leaving home . Of course each had eaten two beef sandwiches and a boiled egg from Schuman 's free lunch . Of course between them they had consumed a sack of popcorn and peanuts , but all this seemed long ago and they were hungry . Munching on their succulent sandwiches , they passed by the fortune teller where two bandanaed and beringed gypsy women were busy reading palms  | with a long waiting queue of not only women but men . They resisted the enticements of the dog-faced girl , scientific wonder though she may have been . They looked at banners advertising the sword swallower and decided it was impossible and a fraud . At the shooting gallery they paused a moment and watched men and women blaze away at swinging and stationary targets with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished their sandwiches , wiped their fingers on their overalls and moved on . " I do n't know , " said Jeremy , " I suppose that 's fun if you have n't got a gun of your own . But look at it  --  three shots for a nickel . I can buy a whole box of twenty-two shorts for a dime and shoot fifty times . " They paused again to watch the merry-go-round where children and grownups were whirled around on wooden horses , ostriches and chariots to the strains of the automatic steam organ . " Ever ride a merry-go-round ? " Sam asked . " Yeah . Once when I was a little boy they had one at the circus . " " So did I. It was all right . " " Yeah , they 're all right for little kids . Do n't see much reason for a man to pay his money just to ride round and round in a circle . " " Listen , Bell , " said Sam , " you 're not getting to be a tightwad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any tightwad . But are you going to Kansas with me Monday or are n't you ? " " Sure , I am . " " Well , we 're going to need our money and I do n't see any sense wasting it on things we do n't want to do anyhow . Of course if you really want to ride this thing I 'll ride it with you . " " No , " said Sam , " I do n't want to ride the damn thing .  | Let 's go around back and see the steam engine work . That do n't cost anything . " They went around the merry-go-round and a cheerful , gray-haired man in overalls and jumper was throwing coal into the furnace under a rusty , steam-leaking vertical boiler and the engine was chugging along happily and there was a smell of steam and coal smoke and lubricating oil . The engine was geared to a shiny vertical drum and a steel cable around the drum turned the merry-go-round . The cheerful fireman slammed the furnace door with his coal scoop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie said , " think you 'd like to buy her ? " " Do n't know , " said Sam , pulling at the visor of his Dawn 's Pride cap . " What 's your asking price ? " " Ten thousand cash . " Sam shook his head seriously . " Too much , " he said . " Listen , " said Jeremy , solemnly , " is that enjine strong enough to run two merry-go-rounds ? " The man laughed . " Look , son , " he said , " there are a lot of fools in the world and the biggest tarnel fools of all are running merry-go-rounds . But I never yet saw a big enough fool to run two merry-go-rounds . " " No , " said Jeremy , " it do n't work that way . I expect you 've heard of the wise man that jumped into the bramble bush ? " The man nodded . " Yep . Scratched his eyes out . " " Sure . And the reason he was a wise man was that he scratched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a big idea and the thing to do , if that enjine is ever strong enough to run two merry-go-rounds , is to get a left-handed merry-go-round that runs the other way and run it together with this one . " Expressionless , the man shook his head . " One merry-goround , one headache , " he said , " two merry-go-rounds , two headaches . " " No , " Jeremy insisted , " this is my idea . Folks ride one merry-go-round and get all wound up dizzy . So they buy  | another ticket to ride the other way and get unwound and undizzy and if you only need one engine it do n't cost you much more to run two merry-go-rounds than it does one . " Sam whistled . " Boy , " he said , " that 's a good idea . " " No , " said the man , leaning on his shovel , " that 's a very bad idea . If you have two merry-go-rounds running in opposite directions people will say , Why in hell they got two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell ' em that when they get wound up dizzy riding in one direction they can get unwound riding in the other direction for another nickel . So they say , Hell , that puts me right where I started and why should I spend ten cents for that ? ' So in no time nobody at all would be riding in either direction . " He reached up and pushed the throttle shut and the engine ceased its snorting and ran only by the momentum of the spinning merry-go-round . " Now , " said the man , " just talking to you cubs , I 've given this trip about a minute extra and I ought to charge you a quarter apiece . But I wo n't . Have you seen Cairo the Queen of Cancan ? " " Nope , " said Sam . The man winked exaggeratedly . " Man alive , " he said , " if I had a merry-go-round that 'd give you the whirl she can give you , I would n't be wearing these here overalls . I 'd be wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and see Cairo as my guest . " " As your guest ? " said Sam . " Yeah . With the quarter apiece you owe me for taking up my time . Well , I got to get a new load aboard and take up the tickets . " Sam and Jeremy walked around the merry-go-round into the middle of the street , and Sam said , " Two merry-gorounds running in different directions . I thought I 'd bust . " " Good idea , huh ? " said Jeremy . " You know , you keep getting those ideas and someday  | they 're either going to take you off to the crazy house or you 'll stumble onto one that 'll make you rich . " Jeremy shook his head . " Nope , " he said . " If I ever get an idea worth a lot of money I 'll tell it to folks and think it 's a joke until I see somebody else get rich from it . Like Grandpa Bell . Once a sewing machine drummer comes into the shop with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how the fool thing worked , but he figured it out and forged some new parts or humatuckers and it worked fine and it seems like a whole lot better than ever . So when the drummer sees what Grandpa did he do n't say anything but takes out a patent and starts his own company making better sewing machines using the humatucker Grandpa made . " " Hmm . Could n't Grandpa Bell have sued that drum-mer ? " " Well , " said Jeremy , " I asked Grandpa that too and he said he was afraid to go to court and sue him because he did n't see what a judge could do but take the sewing machine factory away from the drummer and give it to Grandpa and Grandpa said if there was anything on earth he did n't want it was a sewing machine factory . " Two girls threw confetti into the faces of a couple of well-dressed young men . The young men replied in kind and there were feminine squeals and laughter and one of the young men who wore rimless eyeglasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no flies on you young ladies , no sir .. Do n't you think we ought to join forces and have twice as , much fun ? " The girls giggled and one of them said , " Well , the sidewalk 's free , mister . We ca n't keep you from walking where you want to . " " Fine and dandy , " said the other young man . " Have you ladies ridden on the merry-go-round yet ? " They walked off together while Sam and Jeremy watched them .  | " What you think of that ? " said Sam . " That 's the way they do it , " said Jeremy . " Nobody ever looks at us and we 're just dad-burned hayseeds come to town wearing overalls . " " Well , " said Jeremy , " I would n't want ' em to look at me anyway . " Got a notion , " said Sam , " for us to go get old Bess and drive on home and leave Bill Lowney to walk it . Serve him right for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress up like a dude himself . " " Oh , what 's the difference ? " said Jeremy . " Suppose those gals would look at us and throw confetti on us . What of it ? We 'd just have to buy ' em a ride on the merry-goround and maybe buy ' em tickets to see the sword swallower or something . That 's all we 'd get and we need our money for going to Kansas . Anyhow I do n't think those gals had their hame straps very loose . " " Did n't have their hame straps loose for rubes from the country , " said Sam , gloomily . They were in front of the tent which housed the act of Cairo , the Queen of Cancan , and the sagging canvas banner proclaimed , " FOR MEN ONLY . See Cairo and You Have Seen Everything . Secrets of Oriental Harems Revealed . You Have n't Lived Until You Have Seen Cairo , the Queen of Cancan . Mysterious , Bewitching , Exciting , Wonderful Cairo . FOR MEN ONLY . " Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harem houri that glistened in the flicker of two gasoline torches , and from inside they could hear the tantalizing rise and fall of a reed pipe playing a tuneless strain . Sam looked at Jeremy and Jeremy chewed the corner of his lip . Then the music ceased and there came nervous masculine laughter from within . Sam looked at Jeremy again from the corner of his eye . Then the red curtains at the door parted and a dozen men and half-grown boys emerged . Some of the  | men were grinning mechanically as they put on their hats . Others looked unhappy . A youth who was obviously a farm boy came down the steps and paused near Jeremy and Sam to bite off a chew of tobacco from a black plug . " Say , sport , " said Sam , nodding his head toward the tent , " how is it ? " The youth shifted the lump of tobacco to one cheek and spat . He looked at Jeremy and at Sam and said , " God damn fake . " " How you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing like that . " He jerked a thumb indignantly at the tent . " Well , what they do ? " The boy 's face was flushed and he glared at Sam . " Well , maybe I ought to let you spend your own two bits and find out , but I 'll tell you . You pay your two bits and go in and there 's a nigger man wearing dresses sets on the floor with a rag tied around his head and he plays on a clarinet and then this gal comes out and she 's pretty black too and she takes . off a mother hubbard and she 's got on a dress that do n't come much below her knees . " " You see her legs clear to her knees ? " Sam demanded . " Well , sure , but you do n't think much of that because she 's got some mosquito netting over her face from the eyes down and you do n't know even that 's she 's a gal . Maybe she 's a man all the time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wails on the clarinet and the gal prances back and forth a couple times and wiggles herself like an empty union suit in the wind and this all lasts maybe half a minute , not more , and a man comes out and she stops and the nigger stops playing the clarinet and the man says Queen Cairo ca n't do any more while she 's wearing all the clothes she 's got on and somebody yells , Take ' em off , then , ' and the man says that 's just what she 's going to do and Queen Cairo sees she 's got a smart audience and she 's agreed to do her  | real harem dance with nothing barred for those who 're smart enough to pay a dollar so a lot of ' em paid their dollar and they shooed the rest of us out . " " Hell , " said Sam , " so it 'd cost a dollar and a quarter just to see her show . " " That 's the ticket , " said the youth . " Hell , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That , " said Jeremy , " is worse than the two-headed calf , considerable worse . " They started down the street and two middle-aged men in derby hats were happily throwing confetti into the faces of every girl or woman who passed . " I just thought , " said Jeremy , " we never took the nose bag off old Bess and I 'll bet she 's thirsty after her oats . " " Yeah , " said Sam , gloomily , " maybe Bill 's looked after her , but I reckon we better go see . " The old horse was asleep with her head hanging low , still encased in the canvas nose bag . Jeremy took off the bag , buckled the bridle and they led her around the corner to a watering trough where she slupped up water thirstily . Then they took her and the buggy and hitched her to the rack again . " Wonder wherever Bill is , " said Sam . " No telling . Funny we have n't seen him anywhere . " " Yeah . Wonder where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be fifty miles away by now . Probably is . They stood beside old Bess in the darkness of the street and a white horse hitched behind them blubbered his lips . " Well , " said Sam , " I reckon we might as well go back and see what we can see . " " Guess we 've seen everything there is to see . " " Maybe not . Anyhow we ca n't go home until we find Bill and we might as well go up and wander around as stand : here or sit in the buggy . " They wandered around the square again and then  | bought a bottle of cold strawberry pop apiece , drank it , belched and wandered back and watched the merry-go-round a while . The crowd on the streets was thinning . Older people and children especially were going home . More of the men were showing the effects of liquor . The sidewalks and gutters and brick pavement were littered with confetti , empty sacks , peanut shells and banana skins . The blaring organ on the merry-go-round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tent of Cairo , the mysterious and bewitching , and a tall , black man in green robe and dirty white turban tootled a mysterious and bewitching air on a reed pipe while a crowd gathered . Then Cairo herself appeared  --  very short , chunky and quite dark above her veil . She wore a long , loose purple wrapper and her wrists jingled with brass bracelets . She rolled her slumbrous black eyes , gave a suggestive hitch to her capable hips and jerked her head toward the red-curtained door . Then she undulated thrpugh the door followed by the black piper and the crowd surged forward to buy tickets . Sam and Jeremy moved on and bought another sack of popcorn and another sack of peanuts . " Where , " said Sam , " do you suppose Bill Lowney is ? " " Some saloon . " " Well , we might as well go look into some of ' em then . " Eating their popcorn and peanuts , they peered into the two saloons that stood on the square . Both were crowded but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Scliuman 's saloon . Herman was again on duty at the bar and Sam elbowed his way forward far enough to call and ask if he had seen Bill . " Yeah , " said Herman . " He was in here earlier in the evening . Here about nine o'clock . " " Yeah , I know , " said Sam , " you know where he went ? " " Would n't have an idea . " They went out of the saloon and paused on the sidewalk where they first had seen Henry Fisk.  | " Well , " said Jeremy , " I do n't know . Suppose he 'll show up sooner or later and he knows where the buggy is . Maybe we 'd better just go and sit in the buggy and wait for him . " " Oh , well , I expect so . " They sauntered back to the buggy and climbed in . Old Bess looked around inquiringly and stamped a hoof . They sprawled in the seat and finished the popcorn and peanuts . Sam blew up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jeremy poured the last two or three peanuts into his hand and popped the peanut sack but old Bess did n't move . " Well , bugs , " said Sam , " I 'm going to take a nap . " He sprawled farther down in the seat and rested his head on the back . " Me , too , " said Jeremy . But he did n't sleep . Instead , he thought about Henry Fisk and the Kansas wheat fields and freight trains . " Sam , " he said . " Yeah . " " Think your folks will kick up much of a fuss ? " " Nope . Pa will just say , My advice is do n't do it , but if you do n't want to take my advice you 'll have to learn the hard way . ' " Jeremy laughed softly . " That 's about what Grandpa will say . " Half an hour later Bill Lowney appeared , his white flannel trousers glowing through the dusk . " Well , hello , boys , " he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just got a notion you might have come back to the buggy . " Jeremy and Sam stretched . " Yeah , " said Jeremy . " For a little bit , " said Bill , " I was scared maybe Hank Fisk talked you into climbing on a freight train with him . " " No , " said Sam , yawning . " Ready to go home ? " Bill asked , standing at old Bess ' head .  | " Yeah , if you are , " Jeremy said . Bill fumbled with the hitching strap and then fixed the checkrein . He climbed into the buggy , took the lines and clucked his tongue . " Back up , girl . Funny I did n't see you boys anywhere . Well , it was a great carnival , was n't it ? " He turned old Bess into the street and flicked her flank with the whip . CHAPTER SEVEN The next morning Grandpa Bell called Jeremy twice , then stumped into Jeremy 's bedroom and shook his shoulder . " Yeah , " said Jeremy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell , " Jennifer 's got to be milked and you got to get ready for church . " Jeremy sat up and rubbed his eyes . " All right , Grandpa , " he said . " Sure . " " Have a good time ? " Jeremy nodded , sleepily . " Yeah , good enough time . Well , I expect everybody ought to see a carnival . " Grandpa Bell grinned . " That 's what I thought , " he said . Jeremy got up , went to the pasture , milked the cow , brought back the milk , fed Peter Jackson , ate breakfast , shined his shoes , put on his Sunday suit and a white shirt and stand-up collar and a bow tie . Then he took Grandpa Bell 's clasp knife from his overalls pocket and tenderly put it in the right-hand pocket of his Sunday trousers . The church bell was ringing as he and Grandpa and  | Grandma left the house and walked slowly down the slope with Grandpa 's iron-shod peg leg thumping on the wooden sidewalk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the day Sunday and closer associated with the graveyard up in the trees . The sun was bright but the dew still glittered in the shadows and from every yard came the scent of roses and peonies . Looking over his shoulder , Jeremy could see the sun slanting through the heavy foliage of the cemetery to glisten on white tombstones . He wondered how far along Henry Fisk was . He wondered if Henry was riding on another freight train or perhaps seeing the sights in some strange city or town . In church Jeremy winked at Sam Brock across the way . He sang hymns with the congregation . He dozed a little during the long , droning sermon , making no attempt to follow the thread of the discourse but absorbing a hopeless melancholy from the Rev. Mr. Hurst 's funereal voice . Then he and Sam walked home with the Dennis twins and stood a while at the Dennis gate giving Julie and Judith a negative report on the carnival . Julie and Judith were not identical twins but they looked more alike than usual for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red in Judith 's brown hair and Julie 's eyes were definitely brown instead of hazel . Very much the young ladies now that they were nearly seventeen , their white shirtwaists were very frilly with lace and simulated a bosomy effect which both Jeremy and Sam had remarked was not present when the girls were in house dresses . Their sleeves swelled at the shoulders suggestive of Sir Walter Raleigh 's picture in the history book and , while actual bustles no longer were worn , the girls ' skirts fluffed rearward from their slender waists by some trick of the dressmaker 's trade which simulated grotesquely superhuman buttocks . Jeremy and Sam also had remarked that this astonishing effect was absent when their friends were in house dresses .  | The skirts were long enough so no one could have guessed what sort of shoes the girls wore , except that the toes were as pointed as a rooster 's beak . Jeremy and Sam kept looking at each other and grinning in a wordless debate whether they should tell the girls about going to the harvest fields . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam raised his heavy eyebrows and shook his head . " What 's the matter with you boys , anyhow ? " Julie demanded . " Not a thing , " said Sam , and then laughed . " What makes you think anything 's the matter with us ? " " Well , " said Judith , " you 've both been acting like idiots and looking at one another and giggling like little girls and I 'd like to know what you 've been up to . " " Have n't been up to a thing , " said Jeremy . " N0000 , not much , " said Julie . " Well , I can just tell you have . " Jeremy pushed on the gatepost and it was loose . ' " Well , " said Judith , " you do n't have to tear down our fence . " Jeremy laughed and winked at Sam . " No , honest , " he said , " we have n't been up to anything . " " You know what you act like ? " said Julie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and little Johnny Shirer acted when they 'd read a Buffalo Bill book and were planning to run away and go out west to be cowboys . " Judith and Julie laughed together . " Yes , sir , " Judith echoed . " They do , just exactly . " Sam and Jeremy laughed and grinned sheepishly at each other . Then Mrs. Dennis came to the front door in her changeable silk church dress and called , " Girls , it 's time to come in and start dinner . " " All right , Mama . Coming , " said Julie . " Tell you tomorrow , " said Sam .  | " Promise ? " " Promise . " Jeremy and Sam wandered up the street . " Told your Grandfather yet ? " Sam asked . " No . Have n't had a chance . Have you ? " " hope . Figured I 'd wait until after dinner when he 'll be in a better mood . " Jeremy nodded . " Me , too . " " I 'll come over and see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come over on the way to the pasture . " " Fine . " " Then you can go home with me and talk a little to Pop . " Jeremy nodded . " All right . He wo n't be mean about it , will he ? " " No . But he 'll want to talk to both of us together . " " Sure . " After dinner Jeremy helped Grandma Bell with the dishes and then hesitantly looked for his grandfather , still undecided about how he should break the news . But Grandpa Bell was lying on the haircloth couch , his face pink and content while he purred softly from under his mustache . Jeremy went back into the kitchen , picked up a smooth pine stick from the kindling box and , sitting on the back steps , began to whittle with his clasp knife . The blade was very sharp and despite its weight he found he could cut fanciful scrolls into the pine . The old knife was a warm delight out of all proportion to its intrinsic value . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peg leg stumped from the kitchen to the back porch and Jeremy looked up grinning . " Have a good nap ? " he asked . " Did n't take a nap , " said Grandpa Bell . Jeremy raised his eyebrows . " Well  --  maybe I did doze off for a minute , but I  | would n't call it a nap . Pretty good knife you 've got there , young feller . " " More than pretty good , " said Jeremy . " It 's darn good . " Grandpa Bell sat down beside Jeremy on the step . He was still wearing his Sunday trousers and white shirt but he had removed his collar and tie and coat . His vest was unbuttoned . The hens in the chicken yard were singing to themselves and half a dozen black and white pigeons circled around Robinson 's red barn . Jeremy cut a smooth diagonal notch into the stick . " Grandpa , " he said , " I want to tell you something . " " Fire away . " " Well , Sam Brock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of ought to get away for a while . " Grandpa Bell nodded . " Want to go camping down on the lake ? " " No , not that . Well , of course that 'd be all right , but we got something else figured out . We figure we 'll go out to Kansas for a month or so and make us some big money working in the wheat harvest . " " Kansas ! " Grandpa Bell turned his head and squinted at Jeremy . Then he dug his pipe from his pants pocket and began stoking it from his leather tobacco pouch . " How you figure on getting way out to Kansas ? " " By the cars . " " Cost a pile of money to get out there and back by the cars . Could n't make near enough money working for farmers to pay for the trip . " Jeremy cut an intersecting notch into the stick . " Well , that 's the way it 'd look at first , all right , Grandpa , and that 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran into Hank Fisk at the carnival . You know , the pitcher for Appian City . " " That fat boy . "  | " No , you 're thinking of Joe Timms . This is the tall , lanky fellow . He 's the good pitcher . " " Oh , yes . " " well , Hank Fisk worked for the Appian City Courier and he found out all about this harvest work out west and it seems like they need hundreds and hundreds of men every year and pay three-four dollars a day and board for ' em during harvest and the railroads help the farmers get help by riding the men out and back free . " " Hmm . A man just goes to the railroad and tells them he 's going out to work on the harvest so they give him a ticket free ? " " No  --  well , it is n't quite like that , Grandpa . What they do is let the men ride on freight trains free . " " Hmm . " Grandpa Bell struck a match on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They let ' em ride in those caboose things on the end of the trains ? " " I guess sometimes . Well , mostly , I guess you just get into an empty boxcar and ride that way . " " Sounds like being a tramp to me . That Fisk boy figure on going out to Kansas that way ? " " He 's already gone . Sam and I went down to the railway with him last night and watched him get on a train and go away . He just climbed into a car and the train puffed away and that was all there was to it . " " So you and Sam Brock reckon you 'll do the same thing . " " Well  --  yes . You see Hank Fisk tried to talk us into going with him and we thought about it but I could n't go like that without telling you . " Grandpa Bell shook his head . " I should hope not . I 'd certainly hope not . Well , Jeremy , I do n't think much of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you why . Maybe things are the way this Fisk boy says they are and maybe they ai n't . He 's never been out in Kansas working the harvest before , has he ? "  | " Well , no . But a man who had been told him about it . " " And how do you and Sam know that man was n't a liar ? The world is full of such . " " Hank thought he was telling the truth , all right . " " And how well do you know Hank ? " " Pretty well . Played ball against him a couple of times . " Grandpa Bell shook his head again . " Ca n't know a fellow very well just playing ball against him a couple times . For all you know he 's rattlebrained . " " Do n't think so , Grandpa . A fellow ca n't be as good a baseball pitcher as Hank Fisk and be rattlebrained . " " Well , mind you , Jeremy , I 'm not saying out flat and final that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and practically a man grown , but I want you to use your head . Pretty serious thing for a couple of cubs like you and Sam to put out with just a few dollars in your pockets and go as far away as Kansas on some story you heard secondhand from another boy you do n't know very well who got it from somebody you never saw . Maybe the railroad trains are glad to carry harvest hands free and maybe they 're not . Far 's I know it 's against the law to steal a ride on the cars and they put tramps in jail for it . Maybe there 's exceptions for harvest hands , but I 'd want to find out about that first . I certainly would . First thing I 'd do before I started off on some harum-scarum chase is to find out how much truth there was to the story . " Jeremy desperately cut the scrolls off his stick , sliced the stick clean of his whittling . " I guess it 's the truth all right , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stands to reason those people are going to need harvest hands out there . " " Anyhow , " said Grandpa Bell , " you and Sam could have gone to that railroad depot in Appian City and asked the proprietor if it was true that the cars would carry harvest hands out to Kansas free . " " Suppose we could , " said Jeremy , " but we never thought about that . "  | " Well , I 'd do that first before I figured too much on such a trip . Next time you go to Appian City you might make it a point to just go to the railroad depot and ask . " Jeremy shook his head . " Nell , Grandpa , " he said , " I do n't know . You see , you got to go pretty soon and Sam and I was figuring on starting tomorrow . " " Tomorrow ? " " Yeah . And maybe the railroad at Appian City do n't know too much about the harvest hand business  --  I mean , about carrying ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very far before there are lots of harvest hands . " " If they do n't know about it in Appian City you 'd be liable to be arrested as tramps then . " Jeremy was frowning . " Not much danger of that , Grandpa . Just do the same way this Hank Fisk did . You just go down to the tracks at nine o'clock and there 's a freight train goes on the side track to let the Cannonball Express by and then you climb into an empty boxcar and ride all night and in the morning you 're out far enough so 's they know about carrying harvest hands free . " Grandpa Bell looked at his pipe , pushed down the ash with his finger , took out another match and relit it . Leaning forward with his elbows on his knees , he puffed a moment . Jeremy said , " Well , Grandpa , you could get along all right without me at the shop for a month . " " Yeah ... Of course I could . I 'd miss you like sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you I do n't like this idea at all , at all . I 'm kind of dumbfounded that you 'd cook up such a scheme , but I ai n't going to come out flatfooted and say you ca n't go . If I did that you 'd think I was wrong and in a way I would be wrong . You got to come to your own decision . You either got to make up your own mind that it 's a bad idea or you got to go and find out things for yourself . " " Well , " said Jeremy , " I do n't know , Grandpa . Just seems like I 've got to get away for a while and see things  | for myself . Just seems like I 've got to get away and see things or blow up and Sam feels the same way . " " Wo n't say any more , " Grandpa Bell said . " But it seems too bad that boys ca n't inherit what their fathers and grandfathers learn by hard experience . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told he 's got to look out for cats because cats catch mice , so he knows he 's got to look out for cats without being caught personally . You take a mink or a coon or a beaver and they know they 've got to look out for traps because they hear about their uncles and aunts and grandfolks getting caught in traps . They do n't have to be caught in a trap personally to learn about traps . Just seems like the human young are the only animals that ca n't learn from somebody else 's experience and sometimes I wonder why there 's any people left on earth . Wo n't say any more , Jeremy , if you 're set on going and I wo n't say , I told you so , ' if things do n't turn out the way you hope . " " Well , Grandpa , I do n't just see how I can learn from your experience here on account you 've never gone out west and worked the wheat harvest . If I was going off to war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by telling me what you learned a fellow had n't ought to do and what he should ought to do . But this is different than the things you did when you were a young fellow . I do n't know , Grandpa , maybe it 'll turn out that I 'm wrong but it just seems to me like an old mouse telling a young mouse he ought to be . afraid of cheese in any form because they use cheese to bait traps . Just seems like to me you do n't have to be afraid of cheese but just keep your eyes open for traps . " Jeremy and Grandpa Bell looked up at the sound of footsteps coming around the house and it was Sam Brock , still wearing his Sunday black pants and stiff straw hat but without his coat and collar . " Hello , " Sam said , grinning . His gold collar button , glinted in the sunshine . " Hi Sam , " said Jeremy .  | Grandpa Bell and Jeremy moved over to make room for Sam on the steps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were just talking about us going to Kansas . You talked to your pa yet ? " Sam took off his straw hat and examined the green and white band . " Matter of fact , " lie said , " I did n't . " From her kitchen beyond the Bell barn , Mrs. Jessie Walker was singing in a shrill voice ? " She 's the best that is and I need her in my biz ? " " You have n't ? " Jeremy asked , looking at Sam . " But , " said Sam , " I run into Charley Ferguson , the foreman at the mill , and I told him what we were figuring . " " Yeah ? " " Well , you know Charley 's been in the milling business all his life and he knows about those kind of things from A to Izzard and Charley , he says Hank Fisk is clean bugs . " Jeremy frowned . " In what way ? " " Well , Charley says wheat harvest is a lot earlier out there than here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week or so ago and that it 'll be all over in Nebraska before Hank could ever get out there even riding on fast passenger trains . " CHAPTER EIGHT Jeremy did n't exactly mope during the next week , but a spell of midsummer apathy conquered him so completely that even the baseball game with Appian City lost its sharp importance .  | Appian City won the game , 13 to g , even with fat Joe Timms pitching . Bill Lowney at second base for Dawn 's Mill contributed nobly to the Appian City cause with five undebatable errors , but he had a detailed explanation for each offense . The defeat did n't seem to matter much to Jeremy . " After all , " he said to Sam , " Appian City 's about ten times as big as Dawn 's Mill . They got ten times as many ballplayers to pick from and they ought to be better . " " They 're not better , " Sam insisted . " Generally they 're not anyhow . They just had a good day and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked wearily down from the baseball diamond and now were sitting on the Bell back steps where they had been with Grandpa Bell the previous Sunday . " I do n't know , " Jeremy said . " They sure hit me all over the pasture . " " You just had a bad day . " Jeremy popped his ball into his tough left palm , turned his head and looked at Sam . " Do n't know about that , either . I did n't walk many of them and it seemed like to me I was cannonballin ' ' em in about as good as I ever did . " Sam shook his bead . " Do n't know how to explain it , " he said , " but behind the bat it just seemed like to me you could n't get going . Just seemed like to me you could n't get sweating proper . " " God , " said Jeremy , gloomily , " I sweat enough . " " That 's not what I mean . I mean it seemed like you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't shake ' em off . " Jeremy spat out into the grass . Then he nodded his head . " Well , you 're right . I do n't want to be like Bill Lowney with an excuse for everything , but when I say something to you I know it 's not going any further and practically  | all of the time that game seemed like a dream when you 're trying to run and you ca n't get going . Do n't know what 's wrong with me but I 've been that way for a long time . I was kind of that way even before the carnival and it 's been more so all last week and I do n't know whether I 'm sick or going crazy or what . " " Yeah , " said Sam , seriously . " Well , I do n't think you 're getting sick or going crazy . Or leastways , if you are I am too , on account I 've been more or less the same . I do n't know . " " I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monotone , " and I feel good and maybe there 's been a little rain at night or just a heavy dew and everything is bright and clean and cool and I go up to the pasture and I like the way the sun shines into the bottom of the milk bucket and the birds are singing and my arms feel strong and my feet feel light and I look at a tree and the way it grows with the limbs twisting out from the trunk makes me happy and the way the leaves are sunshiny in one place and black and shadowy in another place the same way , and I look at a spider web in a fence and it 's like silver with the dew and it 's wonderful the way it 's made and there 's the black clodhopper of a spider hunched up in the corner and I have to laugh out loud looking at him . Well , hell , Sam , I guess I 'm crazy . " " No , " said Sam , soberly , " I know how it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he 's so funny . He 's only funny like a puppy maybe and I want to tell him he 's wonderful to make a web like that . And in the pasture back of the water trough there are some toadstools growing and I look at the toadstools and I kick one over and the way it 's made is so wonderful , so delicate like the spiderweb that I squat down and poke it with my finger and I 'm kind of sorry I kicked it over . And old Jennifer 's glad to see me and she nuzzles my arm and I like to milk her and I like the smell of her and the smell of the milk and I come back to the kitchen and Grandma 's there getting breakfast  | and she 's so permanent and pink and dumpy with her specs on her forehead and I know she loves to get me breakfast and that makes me happy and I love that mole on her chin and Grandma is just part of me . " Well , Grandpa and I go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call out friendly and that makes you feel good and it shows you 're part of the town and you fit into the world . And then we go to work and I like that too . I like to work with iron . It makes you feel very good to take a bar of iron and shape it the way you want it and it 's fine to make a set of shoes for a horse and shape up his hoofs and do a good job of shoeing . You know you 've done something worth while and then there 's something else . You kind of feel you own part of that horse from then on . The shoes you made and put on are part of that horse . " " Sure , " said Sam , " I know how it is . " " Well , it 's even more than that . Of course the farmer paid you for shoeing the horse , but that do n't really end it . They 're still your horseshoes on account you made ' em and put ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road and fields and barnyard is your trademark . That gives you an interest in that farm and even in the farmer and the farmer 's wife and kids . It makes you kind of kinfolks in a way and you know if you did a good job that the farmer will feel friendly towards you without even thinking about it . I do n't know , but there 's something kind of fine about blacksmithing . " " I know , " said Sam . " It 's sort of the same way about milling , only of course not as much so because you do n't make any flour all by yourself . But you do know the flour you helped mill goes to make the bread everybody eats and , for instance , I see you banging away on the anvil or pitching a baseball and I know that bread or biscuits you ate made out of flour I helped mill gives your arm the strength and so I own part of that horse you shoed and I own part of the sermon Reverend Hurst preached this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremy , grinning ? " I own part of every gal in town , too . " " Not big enough part to do you any good , " said Jeremy . " Well , what I 'm getting at is that I got no real reason not to be happy and I love the world and I am happy in a way , only there 's an awful something hanging right behind my happiness like a ghost and if I do n't watch every minute it 'll pop out when I 'm working in the shop or even when I 'm playing baseball and particular in church and it 's like somebody shutting down the lid of the coffin on me and I 'm hemmed in and the gate is shut on me and the door is locked on me . There I am , kind of a ghost myself hammering iron or pulling the bellows and everything is nothing and that means things are wearing out for me already . " " Weil , Jesus , " said Sam . " I do n't know , " said Jeremy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll be nineteen hundred and seven and I 'll be twenty-seven years old . Probably by then Julie and I 'll be married and maybe Judy and you 'll be married . Well , I reckon that 'll be all right with me . Julie is about the prettiest girl I ever saw , for my taste anyhow , and we 've been in love I reckon as long as I can remember . " " Sure , " said Sam . " Me and Judy , too , and I think that 's fine for us to have twin sisters . " " Sure . And in nineteen hundred and seven that 'll be three thousand , six hundred and fifty days from now and , taking out Sundays and holidays , I 'll have gone to the blacksmith shop and worked more than three thousand days and it 's just when you 're young and things kind of new to you that you can be happy over the way a tree grows or about a spider web or toadstool or the way birds fly so you just go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk and in ten more years it 'll be nineteen hundred and seventeen and I 'll be thirty-seven years old and probably Grandpa and Grandma will be in the graveyard by then and I 'll have some kids growing up and maybe a boy learning the trade  | with me and every day to the shop , making horseshoes and the horses I 'm shoeing now will be dead for years , and in ten more years it 'll be nineteen hundrd and twenty-seven and I 'll be forty-seven years old and every day pounding out horseshoes and fixing plows and the whole world is the blacksmith shop and home and Dawn 's Mill and maybe twice a year going to Appian City and if you look at a map of the United States you ca n't even find Appian City on it . " " Well , " said Sam , " I reckon old folks have more fun than you give ' em credit for . They get fun out of different things and a lot of ' em keep thinking about Heaven a lot . " " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough Heaven would seem like fun but I ca n't see where it 'd be very exciting sitting around playing on a God damn harp and singing hallelujah all the time . I do n't know . " He shifted his feet irritably . " I think maybe old folks have more fun than you give ' em credit . Pa allows being young ai n't such a bargain as a lot of people make out . He says he 's had more fun since he was thirty than he did before . " " I do n't know , " said Jeremy . " You take a colt in a pasture and he feels good and could have a lot of fun if he could bust down the fence and get clean away . Then you break him to harness and make a draft horse out of him and after about five years he would n't run away even if there was n't any fence . He ca n't see any fun in galloping loose and free . He just plods along hauling a wagon or pulling a plow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little grain so he can keep on hauling the wagon and pulling the plow and the only pleasure he gets out of life is eating and resting when he 's tired and he do n't remember when he was a colt and hankering to bust down the fence . Anyhow I hope he ca n't remember . And I hope he do n't know that by and by he 'll get spavined up and full of rlieumatiz and it 'll hurt him to make a move but he 'll still have to keep working until he ca n't do it any more and then they 'll  | either turn him loose in the pasture to stand around with his aches and pains or they 'll take a shotgun to him . " " Well , Jerry , " said Sam , " I guess you just got the megrims and when you 're that way everything can look pretty black . But , just for instance , supposing this colt could and did bust down the fence . What then ? Vbat 'd he do ? " Jeremy grinned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could have some fun . Hell , he 'd have fun just running around and seeing the country . He 'd have fun just being chased . " " Yeah , " said Sam , " but even if he got away they 'd catch him right away and lead him back and fix up the fence stronger than ever . " " That 's the trouble , " said Jeremy soberly . " There ai n't any place in the world for wild horses any more , but horses were wild once and I think once in a while there 'll be a horse that kinds of knows his people used to be wild and . he 's homesick for it and he 's never a very gentle horse that you can trust and has a harder time of it than most horses . " " Yeah , " said Sam , " and they get hell beat out of ' em . " " That 's right . And some people are the same way , especially when they 're young . There 's something inside of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild and free and not harnessed to a plow or a family or a flour mill or a blacksmith shop and they 're homestick for what people used to be and maybe they try to bust down the fence but they get hell beat out of ' em one way or another until they do n't kick and rear anymore and will pull the plow or zwagon without any fuss or else they put ' em in jail or hang ' em as outlaws . " Sam scratched his head . " You can go hunting in the fall , " he said lamely . " Pugs . That 's just playing you 're wild . That 's just like a spavined old gelding in a spring pasture trying to kick up his heels and act coltish . He looks silly and he knows it and he 's ashamed if he sees you watching . "  | " Well , they do n't geld men . " Jeremy spat . " Not yet , they do n't . " " And you can get married and have your own home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of fun . " " Just being teamed up with another horse to pull the wagon . So there 's always double the load in the wagon . Oh , I do n't know , Sam . Of course I reckon I 'm exaggerating everything , but still there 's a lot of truth to it . But the thing of it is there are still some men who wo n't wear any harness and are free and have some excitement out of life . There 's those Swedes , I forget their names , that started out for the North Pole in a balloon . Mister , they were living . " " But they 're probably dead now . Probably froze to death and it ai n't my idea of fun to freeze to death on an iceberg . " " I do n't know . Maybe they 're dead all right and maybe they are n't . But anyhow those jaspers were n't any half-dead old plow horses . They had some real adventure and maybe it 's worth dying early to be really alive and doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read about in Farm and Fireside who sailed clear around the world in a little boat with just a dog with him . Now there 's a duck that broke down the fence and got away and they never did get a halter back on him . " " Well , " said Sam , " he must have had a lot of spondulix . " " Could n't have been broke . But , I tell you , Sam , there 's lots of birds got enough money to live that never think about living or do n't know how . Take Bill Lowney and I reckon he 's got enough tucked away so he could go around the world if he had enough sense but he thinks he 's having a hell of a time just going to Appian City and arguing with a barkeep about Jim Corbett and drinking a couple of beers and seeing Cairo the Queen of Cancan . " Sam laughed . " Bill paid his iron man to go on inside all right . " " Yeah . And thought he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on much but tights . Well , that gink that sailed around the world in his little boat saw whole islands full of black gals with nothing on including tights and did n't pay any dollar and a quarter either . " " Was that man that sailed around the world a boy ? " Sam asked . Jeremy shook his head . " He used to be a ship captain , the way I remember it . " " Well , there you are . If he used to be a ship captain he was even kind of old , so we got plenty of time . Gosh , Jerry , we wo n't even be old enough to vote for nearly four years . What we got to worry about ? " " That 's just it . He was a sailor and sailors do n't settle down to a habit . They keep moving around the world and seeing new things and doing new things and that makes ' em keep young . The way I look at it being young means not wanting to do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed and ran his hand through his bushy yellow hair . " Sam , " he said , " I do n't know how you feel , but I feel like a milk bucket with a hole in it . You start out from the pasture with the bucket full of milk and you see it 's leaking but you say , Hell , I got lots of milk and plenty of time and there ai n't enough leaking to make any difference . ' So you mosey along without paying any attention and pretty soon you have n't got any milk left and the way I look at it , if we do n't do something about it pretty soon we wo n't have any youth left and we 'll wonder where it went . " " How you going to plug a hole when the bucket 's full of milk ? " " I do n't know . But there's. no God damn use waiting until the bucket is empty to plug it because you do n't get only one bucket of milk from this cow , not ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fisk ? " " Yes . But of course we could n't go without coming home first . If Hank 'd waited for us I 'd been in favor of going even if the harvest was over . "  | Sam shook his head . " Even Hank would n't have gone if he 'd known that . I reckon Hank 's having a pretty rough time of it and maybe 's hungry . " " Does n't kill you to get hungry . He wo n't starve to death . " " I do n't know . And I 'd say there was a pretty good chance of Hank turning into a regular hobo . " " Suppose he does . Maybe hoboes do n't have such a bad life . They 're moving all around and having exciting times and seeing new things . A hobo ai n't a plow horse . " Sam laughed . " You want to be a hobo ? " " No . But I think a hobo has more fun than a plow horse . " " I do n't know . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty years old wish they were n't hoboes but respectable citizens with families and living in a comfortable house with three square meals a day and a wife . I 'll bet they do . " " Well , " said Jeremy , " I 'd think if they wished it very hard they 'd just quit being hoboes and get a job and settle down . Anytime they get tired of being hoboes all they got to do is get a job and settle down . " Sam raised one black eyebrow . " What I mean , " said Jeremy , " is that if , for instance , you 're driving along a road in the spring and there are deep ruts but you 're out of the ruts on top , you know it 's smoother going in one way down in the ruts but there are advantages in being out . Well , what I mean is if you decide you 'd rather travel in the ruts it 's no job to flop down in ' em . But when you 're traveling in the ruts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along on top , it ai n't so easy getting out . " Well , maybe what Grandpa and the rest say is true and it 's better traveling in the ruts all of the way . But I 'm never going to be sure unless I see for myself . I expect maybe it 'd be fun to bump along on top for a while and see some of  | the country and by golly I 'm going to try it before the ruts get so deep I ca n't get out . Then , if I do n't like it after I 've tried it , I can always flop down in the ruts and go on comparative smooth until the graveyard catches up with me . " " When you going to do this ? " Sam asked . " Do n't know exactly , " Jeremy said soberly , " but pretty soon . I 'm going even if I have to walk and start out not knowing where I 'm going or what I 'm going to do . If you 're game to go along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go by myself like Hank Fisk . " Toward the last of August Jeremy received a letter from Chicago . It was written with a fine pen with Spencerian flourishes : Chicago , Ill. , August 22nd , 1897 Friend Jerry : ? What did I tell you about somebody talking you and Sam Brock out of hopping a freight train ? Ha ! Hal Of course for all I know for certain , you and Sam caught yourselves a rattler or , as the saying is , caught yourselves an armload of boxcars , but I would bet considerable that you was talked out of it like I said that night in Appian City . Well , h  --  - , I guess it was just as well considering the way things turned out and I am taking my pen in hand to tell you why . The plan of going out to Kansas for the wheat harvest was a very good plan only too late by the time I got started . That night I left Appian a working stiff got into my car and I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all over except maybe Dakota and Montana and I would be batty to go out because the people are very hostile to boes when the harvest is over and it 's a case of , " Oh , Mama , see all the tramps coming . " And , " No , darling , see all the harvest hands coming . " And , " Oh , Mama , see all the harvest hands going . " " No , darling , see all the tramps going . " This working stiff said the thing to do was to go to Chicago where he was going on account there are loads of employment agencies where they get you a job for work out  | west or down south on construction gangs or mines or sawmills or railroads and pay your fare out there on the cushions and food if you sign up , so I went with him and we got to Chicago and boy , ivhat a town ! You could live in Chicago all your life and never see half of it and something different every minute so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other place if I could get a job in Chicago and decided to try and get a job in Chicago before applying at employment agencies of which there are very many . So I tried and with no trouble got a job as a two-thirdser in the Chicago Interocean composing room at a dollar a day and about half as much work as the Courier and really learning my trade so I 'll be a journeyman printer in a year with a union card and I certainly am having fun and already have a swell Dulcideena that I 'm going out with this afternoon to have a good time . Well , Jerry , why do n't you and Brock cut loose and come to Chicago yourself where everything is fine and you can amount to something and have a good time . H  --  - , There is nothing in Dawn 's Mill for a couple of young bucks like you and even not as much as Appian , if you ask me , and if you want to go someplace else , like I told you , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to go with all expenses paid . I have got a room , a big room by myself with a bed big enough for all three of us until you had jobs and wanted a place by yourself .. I would n't try and come on a freight train now because there are so many railroad bulls and the shacks on the rattlers are very mean and shake you down for your money but it would n't cost you much to come to Chicago on the cushions and you let me know when you are coming and I will meet you only it is better for you to get here at night when I am not working . Did you play Appian City ? Well , I bet Appian win , ha ! ha ! Let me know when to meet you . Yours truly , Henry Fisk.  | CHAPTER NINE On Sunday morning , the 5th of September , Grandpa Bell hired a livery rig from Art Coleman and drove Jeremy and Sam Brock to Appian City . They were going to take the passenger train at 10:22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change cars for Chicago . It was a heavy , breathless morning with fog still hanging in the hollows long after the invisible sun should have been up and about his business . Summer still had more than two weeks to run on the calendar and there had been no frost . Many leaves , however , possibly those which had led dissipated lives or worked too hard , already had withered and fallen to lie as damp and contorted corpses on the streets and lawns of Dawn 's Mill . The sumac was even beginning to turn and patches of the upper pasture were golden yellow when the sun shone . Jeremy had risen early for Sunday morning and had gone to the pasture to milk Jennifer . Oddly , he was pleased that Sam was not present yet to milk the Brock cow and more oddly still he felt sad as he washed old Jennifer 's udder and started to milk . He rested the top of his head against Jennifer 's red flank . " Well , old gal , " he said aloud , " this may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When he had stripped her and hooked the milk bucket on his arm , Jeremy stepped forward and stroked her velvety nose . " Good-bye , you old bastard , " he said . Then he picked up the three-legged stool and went home .  | Not much was said at breakfast until Jeremy was working on his second stack of pancakes . Then Grandma who had only been nibbling at a piece of bacon and a single cake said , " Well , you wo n't forget to write often , will you , Sonny ? " " Oh , no , Grandma , " Jeremy said . " I 'll write heaps . " " And you 'll be home sure by Thanksgiving , wo n't you ? " " Well ? " Jeremy looked up , shifted a wad of pancake , chewed it and swallowed . " I just do n't know , Grandma . It just kind of depends . " " You 'll have to be home by Thanksgiving . Thanksgiving just would n't be anything without you here and that 'd give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yeah , " Jeremy said absentmindedly . He looked at Grandma and suddenly wondered how this situation ever had developed . Did he want to leave home ? Did he really , now that the time had come ? Suddenly he was aghast at realization that the situation had progressed beyond his control . He had started playing with an idea , a romantic , thrilling idea in the abstract . He had put his toe into the current and enjoyed the sensation . He had stepped into the stream and the tug and ripple about his ankles was seductively inviting for a few moments . Then it seemed dull and stupid to stay safely near the bank watching the stream flow by . He had convinced himself he wanted to get out into the deep , swift river and be swept away to strange lands . Despite Grandpa 's warnings , he had ventured out farther and farther until he finally was carried off his feet . He was going , going , out into the unknown . With a sudden twinge of apprehension , Jeremy looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hint to Grandpa Bell would be enough . But he could n't do that and keep his self-respect . And  | what of Sam ? He simply could n't back out now after talking Sam into going . Jeremy looked at Grandpa Bell and Grandpa was n't saying anything . His blue eyes were looking off into the distance , perhaps back into his own youth . His split-nailed thumb was hooked firmly around the spoon in his coffee cup , in accordance with the best etiquette of his day . His left fingers brushed back his mustache and Grandpa Bell drank copiously . Well , Jeremy thought , maybe Sam is feeling the same way . And anyhow , it was a good idea for them to take a vacation and go to Chicago . They could go to Chicago and see things . Maybe they could get jobs and work a week or so just to see what it was like working in a city and then they could come home where they belonged . That was the thing to do . Jeremy wondered how he ever in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that one thing led to another and another and another . He was going to have to watch himself in the future . " Yeah , Grandma , " he said , " we 'll be home before Thanksgiving all right . Maybe a long time before . Shucks . Well , we just got to see a big city and things and maybe see what it 's like to work away from home a little bit . " He laughed shortly and looked down at his plate . " I do n't know . I guess you just got to do a crazy thing now and then when you 're young . " " Some people , " said Grandpa Bell , " have to do crazy things all their lives . Well , I 've said my say , Jeremy , and now all I 've got to tell you is that if you get into any kind of trouble at all or need money all you got to do is send me a telegram and the telegraph office in Appian City will ring Shirer 's store on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even go where you are the fastest way I can get there . "  | " Thanks , Grandpa , but if I thought there was any danger of anything like that I just would n't go . " " You never know what 's going to happen . You could get your pocket picked . You could get blamed for something you never did . You could get sick . " Jeremy frowned . " Gosh , " he said , " I suppose anything can happen , especially if you do n't keep your eyes open but I ought to be man enough to look after myself . " " Now , Jeremy , " said Grandma , " after all , you 're only seventeen and you promise Grandpa you 'll do what he says . If you do n't I just wo n't have a minute 's peace until you 're home . " " All right . I promise . " " And you remember it , " said Grandpa . " Course I do n't expect such a thing 'll be necessary , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jeremy swallowed painfully , realizing more than ever how lonesome and lost Grandpa and Grandma were going to be without him . Grandpa looked at his big silver watch and screeched his chair back from the kitchen table . " Well , " said Grandpa , firmly , " if you 're going , we got to get a move on . Got to get dressed . " When Jeremy was arrayed in his black Sunday suit with silver Christian Endeavour pin in the lapel and linen collar and bow tie and had the old canvas telescope strapped up , Grandma was just tying up his lunch of jelly sandwiches , fried chicken , pickles , cake and apples in a shoe box . Peter Jackson was parading around the kitchen , tail in the air , and much interested in Grandma 's operations . Jeremy picked him up and scratched his jowls . Peter Jackson purred . Grandma smiled cheerfully as she handed the box to Jeremy . " That , " she said , " had ought to stay your appetite on the cars . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumping Peter Jackson on the floor . " Now do n't you worry about me because I know how to take care of myself . "  | He stooped and kissed her . " Ta-ta , Grandma , " he said . " Be a good boy , Jeremy . " Jeremy turned abruptly and left the house with Grandpa . He carried the telescope and Grandpa carried the shoe box in one hand and his pipe in the other . Jeremy looked at the sky . " Wonder if it 's going to rain , " he said . " Do n't think so , " said Grandpa . " Do n't smell like it . " With a sudden thought Jeremy moved the telescope to his left hand and plunged his right into his pants pocket . He could n't remember shifting Grandpa 's clasp knife from his work clothes . It was there safely enough and he felt comfort in its presence . Sam Brock was waiting for them at the livery stable , waiting outside the door with a big battered leather valise at his feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Endeavour pin  --  a silver E circled by a capital C. He had a shoe box of lunch under one arm and he grinned when he saw Grandpa Bell and Jeremy come around the corner into Main Street . Shadows under Sam 's dark eyes told Jeremy that Sam also had slept poorly . Everything on Main Street was closed for Sunday except the livery stable and Doc Ackerman 's pharmacy . There were dead leaves , scraps of paper and cigar butts on the sidewalk in front of Shirer 's Emporium . The river was low and there was a sleepy , Sunday sound to the diminished flow of water over the mill dam . Freddie Wise already had hitched a black gelding named Joe to a buggy and Jeremy and Sam put their luggage and lunch boxes in the rear while Grandpa Bell hoisted himself to the driver 's position and adjusted his peg leg against the dashboard . Then Jeremy and Sam climbed in the left side and they were off . " Any last minute arguments ? " Jeremy asked Sam . " Oh , sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . "  | Grandpa Bell took his pipe from his mouth and spat into Main Street . Jeremy turned his head and looked up the hill to the Dennis home where he and Sam had said self-conscious and bantering good-byes to Julie and Judith the evening before . Now the twins would be getting ready for Sunday School . He looked at the familiar old schoolhouse and at the churches and the baseball diamond and the pasture and , beyond to the right , the shadowy gloom of the cemetery . Grandma would be washing the breakfast dishes and would have to dry them by herself . Grandpa would have to milk Jennifer tonight and from now on . He looked at Grandpa and Grandpa was puffing on his pipe . Then Grandpa took his pipe from his mouth and clucked at Joe . They turned to the right and entered the echoing dusk of the covered bridge . Joe was a pretty good traveler for a livery stable horse and they got to Appian City just as the church bells were ringing their solemn summons for Sunday School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girls and clean but disgruntled little boys on their way for exposure to a Bible lesson . Several cyclists , breaking the Sabbath , flashed by ringing their bells . Joe pointed his ears and broke stride but controlled himself when Grandpa spoke to him soothingly . " Well , " said Grandpa , " it appears this nag 's a little skittish . Reckon we 'd better not hitch him too close to the depot or he might bust loose when the cars come . " They pulled up to a rack in front of a little store that was a good three blocks from the station and Grandpa tied the hitching rein firmly . There was a bright new sign in front of the store which read , " SCHOOL SUPPLIES . Modern Noiseless Slates and Pencils . Pencil Boxes . Crayons , all colors . Pocket Pencil Sharpeners . Milne 's Arithmetics . Stepping Stones to Literature . We Supply Every Need of the Scholar . "  | Jeremy stretched and yawned . " Ho-hum , " he said and grinned at Sam . He was tense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dawn 's Mill . They got their luggage from the buggy and Grandpa Bell carried one lunch box under each arm , stumping along between them , and Sam 's leather valise , shaped like a halfmashed sausage , squeaked sleepily as he walked but Jeremy 's leather-strapped canvas telescope stuttered querulously against being taken from retirement . A family was approaching on the sidewalk , hurrying to avoid being late to Sunday School . Two little girls in starched white dresses and wide red sashes were leading a smaller kilted boy between them . The girls wore queer little hats on top their curls tied beneath their chins with ribbons . The mother was thin and pale and red-eyed and wore an extravagant hat with a half-moulted thrush spread-winged on the left side . The father was stooped and shabby and bearded and wore a high-crowned battered derby . Grandpa Bell , Jeremy and Sam went into single file to pass the family and Grandpa Bell spoke , " Good morning to you . Nice day . " " Morning , " said the man , unsmiling . Grandpa Bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the Railroad Lunch and the drab yellow box of the Star Hotel with its drawn yellow shades . The gasworks across the street were silent but there was a strong smell of gas in the air and thin gray smoke drifted from the brick stack into the gray sky . The squat , mud-brown railway station dozed in the Sunday morning calm , its semaphore stark against the sky , and pigeons side-stepped and ruffled their feathers along the curlicued cornices . A red-wheeled Wells-Fargo Express wagon was backed up to the far side of the building and the old white horse 's head was bowed in sleep over its hitching weight . Grandpa , Jeremy and Sam went into the acrid waiting  | room and put their luggage down on an iron-armed bench near the door  --  Sam 's leather valise , Jeremy 's canvas telescope and the two shoe boxes . In the center of the room was a huge , round-bellied heating stove sitting cold and rusty in a wide frame filled with sand . The stovepipe , supported by wires nailed to the ceiling , wavered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a desperate leap , terminated at a smoky flue . Jeremy yawned . " Ho-hum , " he said . Beyond the grilled ticket window the agent 's telegraph sounder clicked excitedly . Grandpa thumped over to the window and put his forearms on the ledge . " Good morning , " he called inside , " nice day . " " Howdy , " a voice replied . " That ten-twenty-two train of cars on time ? " " About ten minutes late . " " Well , " said Grandpa , " these young bucks would like some tickets for it . " He stood aside and Jeremy and Sam pushed nervously to the window . The agent was a frozen-faced thin man with a green eyeshade worn crookedly on his balding head . " Where to ? " he demanded . " Well , " said Jeremy , pulling out his pocketbook , " Chicago , Illinois . " " Round trip ? " " Well ? " Jeremy looked at Sam who also was dragging out his pocketbook ? " no , I guess not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want tickets ? " Sam nodded . " Do you ? " Sam swallowed . " Yes , " he said . The agent turned to one side and pulled slips of green paper from a rack . He rubber-stamped them . He wrote on them with purple ink . He spanked them through a machine . Then he laid them down and stepped over to the desk in  | the bay window , apparently to answer a summons from the telegraph sounder , opened a switch and , leaning over the desk , clicked a moment on a key with his right hand while he scrawled a word or two with his left . Then he closed the switch and came back to the window and said , " Have to change cars at Bonafield Junction to North bound Forty one at threetwentyone . " " Huh ? " said Jeremy . " Conductor 'll tell you . " " Wait a minute , " said Jeremy , taking his pocketbook off the window ledge . " I 'm buying a ticket from you to go to Chicago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know , that goes with the ticket . Just suppose you tell me in American . I do n't understand that telegraph language . " The agent raised his eyebrows at Jeremy and then grinned . " All right , son , " he said . " When you get to Bonafield Junction you 'll get off this train and that 'll be about two-forty or maybe two-fifty because she 's running a little late . " " Two-fifty , " said Jeremy , " that 'd be ten minutes to three . " " That 's right . Then you wait right there at the station for the Chicago train which is due at three-twenty-one and get on that . " " Thank you ever so much , " said Jeremy . " Think you can remember that ? " " I think so , " said Jeremy , " but if we forget it now it 'll be our fault and not because we did n't understand in the first place . " They got their luggage and went out on the platform and leaned against a high-wheeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drizzled drowsily . The rails stretching east and west were as bright as polished silver against the drab gray sleepers and cindered roadbed . Inside his bay window the agent 's green-shaded bald head bent over his telegraph desk .  | Grandpa Bell stoked up his pipe . He thumped his peg leg on the platform . " Well , Jeremy , " he said , " do n't think you want to start out carrying a chip on your shoulder that way . A fellow with a chip on his shoulder 's looking for trouble and trouble 's one thing you never have a hard time finding when you 're looking for it . " Jeremy stared . " Gosh , " he said , " I did n't think I had any chip on my shoulder . " Grandpa shook his head . " Pretty snappy at that depot proprietor there , " he said . " People do n't like to be snapped at , I can tell you , especially by young cubs . " Jeremy looked at Sam and Sam was gazing down the track . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the way it strikes me is that Sam and I are going to be pretty dad-burn green even with the best we can do and we 'll likely make all kinds of blunders because we do n't know any better . Well , I aim to find out all I can find out about everything I can just as early as I can and from the proper folks . That proprietor in there has a job of selling tickets to folks to go places on the cars and he 's paid his wages for doing that and telling the customers where and how to take trains . I do n't know , but if a farmer comes into the shop and buys a set of horseshoes he 'd expect us to put ' em on the horse . That 's part of the job . It 'd look like it was part of that proprietor 's job when he sells a railroad ticket to tell the customer how to use it . And when he mumbled out something we could n't understand , I think I had a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe the conductor on the train . " Grandpa Bell grinned . " Depends on how you ask . If a farmer comes into the shop and wants some shoes for his horse and he bellers out , Put some shoes on this horse and do it right away and see that you do a good job of it , ' why I 'd tell him to go to hell . Likewise , you could have said to this proprietor when you did n't understand him , Excuse me , mister , what was that again , please ? ' " " I suppose so , " said Jeremy , " but the way I figured ,  | he probably had some dyspepsia on account he stays in the house all the time and felt mean and thought he could take it out on me because he could see I was green . The way I figured it , Sam and I were entitled to know about that train and from him and he was kind of shortchanging us when he says the conductor 'll tell us . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way and you 've got to look after your rights . But something I 'd like you to remember is that it never costs you anything to be polite at least at first and oftentimes it pays you for the trouble . " " Well , Mr. Bell , " said Sam , " that 's good advice , all right , but I 've seen folks that just think you 're soft and easy when you 're polite to ' em . " Grandpa Bell took out his big watch and glanced at it . " Train should be here now , " he said . " It 's ten minutes late , " said Jeremy . " Well , it 'll be along , " said Grandpa . " Yes , Sam , there are cattle like that , all right , but even so it pays to be polite to ' em at first until you see definite that they 're trying to slicker you . " A man in striped overalls and visored cap came pulling a four-wheeled truck from around the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail sacks . The other end was stacked with egg cases . The pearl handle of a small revolver protruded from a holster at his hip . Startlingly loud and near came the shriek of a locomotive whistle and they turned to see the train charging toward them , not more than two hundred yards away , rocketing in a swelling roar . Black smoke exploded from the engine 's tall stack and rippled back in the wind of its passage . The glass in the big square headlight glinted as the monster bounded and swayed . Sam and Jeremy grabbed up their luggage and lunch boxes . The whistle shrieked again and the locomotive was upon them , black and glint and an ornate red umbilicus at  | the center of the boiler , and the earth shook and the engine was gone and sparks flew from the screeching brake shoes of the green-black coaches . " Well , good-bye , Grandpa , " Jeremy said , excitedly . He started to shake hands but his hands were full and Grandpa took hold of his arm . " Be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't be too long about coming home and remember what I told you about calling on me for anything . " " I 'll remember , Grandpa . Take care of yourself and Grandma . " Sam was hurrying toward a car platform . His hat was over one ear . Suddenly he turned and called in a shrill voice , " Well , good-bye , Mr. Bell . " " Good-bye , Sam . " Grandpa Bell 's blue eyes were strangely bright and there was a strained , fixed smile under his mustache . " I guess I 'd better get aboard , " Jeremy said . Grandpa squeezed his arm . " Have a good time , Jeremy . " " Thanks . Well , good-bye , Grandpa . " Jeremy turned abruptly away , climbed up the car steps to the platform and saw Sam plowing down an aisle between rows of red seats . He followed Sam and the aisle was so narrow he had to carry the telescope valise in front of him . There was a strange mixture of odors  --  of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . Sam slid into an empty seat and looked around to grin at Jeremy . He had his leather valise and the shoe box of lunch in his lap . Jeremy plumped down beside Sam with his telescope and lunch box on his lap also . " Gosh , " he breathed , " it 's kind of hot in here . Can you open that window ? " They put their luggage on the dusty floor under the seat and their shoe boxes on the ornate brass rack above the window . Sam tugged ineffectively at the dirt-streaked window and Jeremy , leaning over , gave a yank that broke it  | from its moorings and sent it up as far as the catch would allow . " A blacksmith , " said Sam , " comes in handy once in a while . " Grandpa was standing on the station platform smoking his pipe . His black , broad-brimmed hat was on the back of his head and he looked unhappy and very much alone . " Hey , Grandpa , " Jeremy called . Grandpa then saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe from his mouth and said , " Well , boys , do n't let anybody sell you the Chicago City Hall . " " Not even if it 's a bargain ? " Jeremy asked . " Not at any price . I hear there 's a flaw in the title . " The locomotive bell began to ring and Jeremy was tingling with excitement . A voice sang out , " All aboard ... . ' Bo-ard . " Then they were moving , very slowly , but moving . The locomotive snorted and they jerked forward . Grandpa raised his right hand with the pipe in it and gave a salute . Then he was gone and the station was gone and the wheels clicked over the switch tracks and the whistle shrieked as they gathered speed and Appian City was gone while they galloped through a grove of second-growth timber . Sam gave Jeremy his elbow in the ribs . " Well , by God , " he said , " here we go . " " Here we go , " said Jeremy . But all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on the station platform with his right hand raised in farewell salute .  | CHAPTER TEN The blue-uniformed , brass-buttoned conductor , walking with a dignity cut to meet the swaying coach , called , " Tickets , " and Sam and Jeremy nervously were holding their green slips in their hands . The conductor tore off the lower segments , punched them with a nickel-plated punch he carried on his little finger and put them in his pocket . Then he wet his thumb , peeled two small red rectangles of cardboard from a rubberbound bundle , punched them twice and stuck one each in Jeremy 's and Sam 's hatbands . " Leave those in there , " he commanded . " You change cars at Bonafield Junction . " When the conductor was gone they carefully took off their hats and stared at the slips . Then they put their hats on again . Jeremy thought that Grandpa now had walked back to the buggy , unhitched old Joe and was starting his lonesome drive back home . Half an hour later when the train had stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nearing the turnoff from the Chula Highway . They took turns sitting next to the window where they could lean out and feel the wind and hot cinders on their faces and on curves in the track see the locomotive with its thrashing connecting rods and big drive wheels . At 11:3o Sam said , " Well , Jeremy , do n't know about you , but I 'm ready for something to eat . " They got down their shoe boxes and opened them and Sam had a stack of sandwiches with thick slices of boiled  | ham . They divided , trading ham sandwiches for fried chicken and Jeremy thought that pretty soon Grandpa would be home and he and Grandma would sit alone at the kitchen table for Sunday dinner and they would n't have much to talk about and they would have the rest of the fried chicken that Grandma had n't put into his box , but she had given him the best parts so they would have to eat the neck and back and wings . Jeremy remembered how , when Henry Fisk had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering how far away Henry had got and he supposed Grandpa and Grandma would be thinking about him that way , only more so . At Bonafield Junction where the brakeman bellowed into the car , " Bon'fel Junksun  --  Change for Chicago , Milwaukee and Nor'west , " they stumbled from the car , saw their old train pull briskly away , and they stood on the platform of the big brick station , apprehensive that they might make a mistake and get on the wrong train , for there were dozens of tracks and there were switch engines that looked odd with platforms instead of cowcatchers in front , snorting and ringing bells and clanking and pushing and pulling freight cars and passenger cars this way and that , and there were overalled men pulling and hauling trucks full of baggage and express crates and milk cans all over the place . Then a passenger train came roaring and grinding in and people carrying hand baggage shuffled from the station waiting room and people on the platform picked up their grips and valises . " Come on , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick out a good seat . " They crowded forward , but had to wait because passengers were leaving the train . Two women with three children pushed ahead of them and Sam looked at Jeremy and shook his head . He shifted his valise from his right to his left hand .  | " All right , " a trainman called , " have your tickets ready . Show your tickets . " The women displayed their tickets and the trainman boosted them and the children up the steps to the platform . Jeremy and Sam had dug their tickets out and Sam , with his valise in his left hand and the ticket in his right , raised his right arm and rubbed his nose with his wrist . " See your ticket . " Sam held out the green slip . The trainman took it and frowned with annoyance . " This not your train , " he said . " This train goes to St. Louis . " He irritably shoved the ticket back at Sam and Sam and Jeremy pulled hurriedly away while the people behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the platform . " Of all the God damn greenhorns , " Sam muttered . " Yeah , " Jeremy said , soberly . " It 's a mercy we did n't land in St. Louis , Missouri , instead of Chicago , Illinois . Well , we just got to watch ourselves and not go rushing into things until we know what we 're doing . " " Trouble is , if you wait too long your train is liable to pull out without you or anyhow other folks will get all the good seats . " " Ca n't worry too much about seats . Well , I can see we 'd have done fine riding on freight trains when we practically climbed on the wrong passenger train even when we 've got tickets and everything . " They put their luggage down and stood in silence while men and women moved around them . Across the railroad yards stood a brick building two floors high and possibly three hundred feet long . The double row of arched windows were closed and only a haze of blue smoke came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building over there , " Sam said sadly . " Yeah . " " Must be a factory of some kind . "  | " Yeah . " " Sign says Empire Manufacturing Company . ' Wonder what they want with a name like that ? Empire Manufacturing Company do n't say anything . Wonder why they do n't have a name that says Empire Shoe Company or Empire Plow Company or Empire Oatmeal Company or whatever in hell they make . " " Maybe , " said Jeremy , " they want to keep whatever they make a secret . " " Ca n't do much business selling secrets . " Jeremy was thinking that pretty soon now Grandpa Bell would have to go up to the pasture and milk Jennifer and then get ready for church because he and Grandma had n't gone to church in the morning . Jeremy was n't very happy . Traveling was n't the way he thought it was going to be . The grand elation of freedom and thrill of motion was missing because his mind kept turning back home . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would see and do in Chicago because his mind kept turning back instead of forward . After church Grandpa and Grandma would come home and feel pretty lonesome because he was away and the house would seem empty to them . They 'd have a supper , probably of corn-meal mush and milk and maybe some raw onion and coffee . There would n't be any fried chicken left from dinner because Grandma had put so much into his lunch box . Then another train came in and this time it was the Chicago train all right and they got aboard . This time the car 's seats were green plush instead of red and they sat on the right side of the car instead of the left , and it seemed strange and foreign because they had grown used to red seats and to riding on the left side of the car . When it grew dusk the brakeman came through the car with a taper and pulled down the oil lamps , one by one , and lit them . The lamps swayed with the car and threw odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the night air and Jeremy felt very far from home indeed and began to glow inwardly now and then at thoughts of Chicago . The train seemed to be traveling faster through the night and occasional bright sparks from the locomotive ripped like fireworks past their window . They bought a package of Crackerjack from the train butcher and ate the sticky popcorn with relish . Near the bottom of the box Sam found a small lead whistle and blew on it tentatively . It made a small , shrill shriek that caused nearby passengers to stare and Sam and Jeremy hunched down in their seats chuckling in embarrassment . Then they bought an orange apiece from the butcher , peeled them , ate them and wiped their hands on their handkerchiefs . At last outside lights began to group together more and more and there were solid banks of houses and buildings and the locomotive was blowing its whistle again and its bell was ringing and passengers began shifting and getting baggage down from racks and opening valises and closing them . Sam leaned from the window and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He touched Jeremy with one finger and looked at him with round black eyes . " We 're right in Chicago now , " he said . " Yep , " said Jeremy , " I expect we are . " Henry Fisk met them and shook hands with dignity . " Welcome to the big city , " he said . Henry was wearing a gray derby hat and the bristling start of a red mustache . His coat was brown and longskirted and trimmed with braid . His celluloid collar was high and winged and adorned with an elaborate paisley cravat and sparkling horseshoe pin . He carried a bamboo cane . " My stars , Hank , " said Sam , " you got rich already ? " Henry laughed patronizingly . " Not rich , " he said , " but you got to look after your appearance in a place like Chi .  | Man alive , but will you ducks love this place . Come on and how 'd you like an oyster stew ? The treat 's on Hank . " As they made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sam took hold of Henry 's arm . " By God , " he said , " I do n't want to lose you . If we lost you we 'd never get out of here alive . " Jeremy 's eyes roved over immensity  --  bewilderingly bright in the lavender glare of countless sputtering arc lights . Then they were on the sidewalk , also glaring with arc lights and crowded with people  --  well-dressed ladies and gentlemen , ragged , unshaven , bleary-eyed men , ragged barefoot newsboys screaming " extra " at the top of their voices , and a general din of ceaselessly ringing streetcar bells and banging of iron hooves and grinding of iron tires on cobblestones . " How in hell , " asked Sam , still hanging to Henry 's arm , " do you ever cross the road here ? " Henry laughed . " Just have to kind of watch your chance . Well , here 's the oyster bar . They 're closed all summer and just open on the first of September . " They entered the bar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Henry 's cane next to the wall . Henry , sitting between them , grinned first at Jeremy and then at Sam . " Well , " he said , " it 's sure good to see you ducks . You 're going to be bugs about this place , I 'm telling you . " Well , I do n't know , " said Jeremy , " it 's sure enough noisy . What you call that thing on your lip ? " " Ai n't named it yet . " " Know whether it 's male or female ? " " Must be a male . Anyhow it kind of twitches when it gets close to a pair of ruby lips . " Henry ordered three stews and coffee . " Lookit , Hank , " said Sam , leaning forward , " what you done in this big town ? Find a gold mine already ? " Henry laughed with easy self-assurance , picked up a  | pepper sauce bottle and turned it around in his hands . " Not yet , I have n't . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my lucky town . First thing off , I was lucky to come to Chicago instead of going out to the wheat fields . Then , zowie , I find my job which pays good already and a chance to get my union card in another year . Then , zowie , I find my gal and maybe that was n't good luck . Then the composing room has a weekly lottery and ever'body puts in four bits and the very first week I win the top prize of fifty-four dollars . And the third week again I win the top prize of fortyeight dollars . That 's how I got these here glad rags . " Henry pushed his gray derby to the back of his red head . " Yep . It looks like to me that little Henry is Fortune 's child in Chicago . How ever did I stay so long in Appian City ? " The oyster stews were rich with a lump of yellow butter melting and unwinding on the hot , creamy surface . A gaunt-faced man in a greasy derby sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oysters . When the waiter set down the bowls he said to this man , " Yeah , I think we should ought to send a whole fleet of gunboats down there and show those greasers a thing or two . " The man nodded and swallowed . " That Hearst 's right , " he said . " Getting so the American flag do n't mean a damn thing any more . " Henry sprinkled his stew liberally with celery salt and black pepper and cascaded a handful of oyster crackers into the savory bowl . Sam and Jeremy followed his example and Sam dug out a fat succulent oyster . He blinked at its size , having never seen anything more than canned cove oysters before , but he bit into it . " Ever eat as good an oyster stew ? " Henry demanded . " Um , " Sam breathed , chewing sand . " Sure enough fine , " said Jeremy . They ate their stews with rye bread and butter and sliced cucumber pickles and drank their coffee . Then Henry  | paid the waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and up the wooden steps to an elevated station . " This el , " he said , " will take us pretty near my place . " Jeremy looked at Sam and Sam shook his head . Then the elevated train puffed in and they got aboard . The car was crowded and they stood in the aisle with their grips between their feet and clung to overhead straps . " Look , " said Sam into Henry 's ears , " you mean they got a bridge like this right through town for trains to run on ? " " Yep . They got a lot of elevateds like this . You can go near practically any place in town on an el . " The train started and quickly was running full speed , rocking and jerking , and the clacking of wheels over rail joints , the creaking of the cars and the thundering exhaust II of the locomotive made conversation nearly impossible . Coal smoke whipped into the open windows but the passengers seemed not to mind either the dirt or the noise and sat placidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were running between ranks of sooty brick tenement buildings and thousands upon thousands of windows , most of them lighted by gas fixtures . Inside the rooms were people  --  men , women , children , some of them busy with household tasks , some of them eating , some playing cards , some just sitting , many of them leaning from their windows watching the train go by . They ground to a stop at another station and some passengers crowded off while others crowded on . " So this is Chicago , " said Jeremy . " Well , " said Henry , " this is kind of a bad spot along here . This is kind of what they call a slum , but there are a lot of places finer than you ever saw in your life . " " It 'd sure be an experience , " said Jeremy , " to live in one of those buildings along with a million other people and having those trains of cars booming along every little bit . " " Oh , you get used to that pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and a train on the opposite  | track roared through in the other direction in a cloud of smoke and flash of light . Sam raised his shoulders in a cringing gesture and rolled his eyes . " Jesus , " he yelled into Jeremy 's ear , " I thought we 'd blowed up sure that time . " Jeremy shook his head grimly , took hold of the strap with his left hand and wiped his perspiring right on his thigh . Again they were ripping and roaring past endless ranks of tenements with thousands of windows , lighted and unlighted , catching intimate glimpses of the residents . After two more stops Henry said , " Well , we get off next time , " and Jeremy found himself hoping fervently that Henry did not live as these people were living with the elevated trains plunging past his windows . Henry did n't . His room was two blocks down a side street from the elevated . It was three flights up and to the rear . As they trudged up the last flight with their grips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live higher up than Doc Bush 's windmill . " " Good climate up here , " said Henry , " and safe from bottomland floods . Well , you ducks , here we are and welcome . " He put a key into the door at the end of the third floor hall and then turned around . " Right across there , " he said , " is the bathroom and privy and that makes it handy in the morning when there 's a rush on . Just a sec until I light the light . " Pushing the door open , Hank struck a match and applied it to a gas light in a wall fixture . The mantle plopped into white brilliance . " Drop your grips anywhere , " he said , " or here , put ' em in the closet out of the way until you want ' em and hang up your hats . " He hung his own gray derby carefully on a closet hook . The room was furnished with a worn red carpet , a yellow oak bureau and washstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge wooden bed with a red counterpane . There was a flowered washbowl and pitcher on the commode , a tin alarm clock , brush and comb and shaving materials on the bureau . A brightly colored lithograph of an imitation Gibson girl hung on the wall above the bed . There was one window from which dim walls , faraway lights and other windows could be seen . " Across there , " said Henry , " on the fourth floor there 's a gal that sometimes forgets to pull down her shade . " " My gosh , " said Sam , looking out the window . " Shade 's down now , " said Henry , " but sometimes she stands in front of the window combing her hair and things in nothing maybe but a corset . She 's kind of fat and boy , has she got ' em . " " Hmm , " Jeremy breathed , looking out . " Well , hell , " Henry 's lean face wrinkled in a wide grin , " make yourselves at home . Sit down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the straightbacked chair and stretched out his long , thin legs . Sam still peered out the window . " Well , Jerry , I expect this room ai n't much for looks compared maybe to the Palmer House but I bet you do n't find any better bed than that at the Palmer House or any other place . Bounce on it , Jerry . Ai n't that something ? Feel how thick that there mattress is and by God , there 's coiled springs underneath her . A duck that could n't sleep good in that bed just ai n't got any sleep in him . Sometimes when I 'm coming in and tired and sleepy I just make believe to myself that I 'm going to bed on that God damn cot I had in the Courier 's stock room that just had flat springs I covered up with some gunny sacks of waste paper and then I get into this here bed and , boy , it 's like going to heaven in a hansom cab . " Jeremy bounced on the bed . " Sure all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him .  | " You know , " Sam asked , " where there 's a flour mill in town ? " Henry frowned . " There 's lots of flour mills here , but do you want to go back to a mill ? " " That 's the trade I 'm learning , and I 'd kind of like to see a big city flour mill . " " I know and that was all right in Dawn 's Mill . But I tell you ducks , I 'm finding out that the thing to do in Chicago is to get into some good business and learn that . Do n't ever make any real money working in a mill or at a trade . " " You 're working at your trade , are n't you ? " Jeremy asked . Henry nodded . " I know , sure . It 's a good thing to have a trade for something to fall back on . I want to get my union card , but I can tell you little Henry ai n't going to be satisfied being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things my gal has pointed out to me . Yes , sir . Tell you what I 'm doing and maybe it 'll seem silly to you , but I 've already signed up to take a correspondence course in English so I can talk and write like an educated gent . " " No , " said Jeremy , " I do n't think it 's silly at all . " " Well , I guess you ducks graduated from high school and do n't need it , but I was n't a very good scholar and when I flunked it in the seventh grade I never went back . " " No , " said Jeremy , " there 's just ten grades in Dawn 's Mill . We graduated from Dawn 's Mill all right , but there 's twelve grades in a regular high school . " " What you going to do , " Sam asked , " when you learn to talk like a dude ? " " It 's not talking like a dude , " said Jeremy . " Let him alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all right to know . " Sam leaned back on the bed and put his hands in his pockets . " It 's all right to know , but nobody talks like a book these days but dudes . I do n't talk  | like a book , but I can parse sentences till hell wo n't have em . " Sure , " said Jeremy , " and you can puke in the flax . " " Give me a sentence , " said Sam . " Give me any sentence and I 'll show you whether or not I can parse . " Jeremy grinned at Henry , jerked his head toward Sam and made a circular motion with his finger at his temple . " What you aim to go into , Hank ? " Jeremy asked . " I mean after you 've finished that course ? " " Well , " said Henry , " like I said I aim to get my union card first of all , so I 'll always have something to fall back on . Then I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my mind entirely yet whether I want to get me a job in the business office and maybe sell advertising or get a job being a reporter . Being a printer 'll help you in either place . If you 're a printer you know how ads should be and you could sell ' em better . If you 're a printer it helps you being a reporter and editor . Lots of big newspaper editors used to be printers . But whatever I do I 'm going to make a go of it because I 'm willing to work just a little bit harder than anybody else . Right now I 'm making a point of being just a little better apprentice than the forman ever saw . I make it a point to get to work about fifteen minutes early every morning and see that everything 's shipshape and I take the printers ' coats and hand ' em their aprons and call ' em all mister and I look around for things to do instead of having to be told everything . " " That , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Davin smart , " said Sam . " Nothing to it . I 'd rather be doing things than sitting down picking my nose . " " Funny thing , Hank , " said Sam , " I always had a notion you were a little lazy . " " Well , hell . You think a fellow ought to wear himself out flopping around like a chicken with his head chopped off ? To be honest , I never been as strong as some people and  | get tuckered out before some do . My old lady died of consumption and maybe that 's why and maybe I just did n't get enough grub when I was growing up but that 's not here or there . Anyhow I grew into a beanpole and so I watch myself and loosen up like a cat or dog when I ai n't actually doing something . I guess that 's being lazy in a way and I guess you got the notion from seeing me pitch baseball . Well , hell , they do n't count it against you if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " said Jeremy , " and you 're about the best pitcher I ever saw . " " No better'n you . " " Bugs , " said Jeremy . " You beat us plenty last year . " Henry grinned . " You play Appian this year ? " " Yep , " said Sam . " Jerry had a bad day . Appian win , thirteen to nine . " " It 'd been worse if you had pitched , " said Jeremy . " Oh , no . Joe Timms is pretty good  --  better than a lot of people think . Maybe you 'd have even won if I 'd been there . " " Bugs , " said Jeremy . " Well , that 's all ancient history now . Anyhow , it 'd probably be exciting being a newspaper reporter in a town like Chicago . " Henry nodded . " Yeah . Only thing , newspaper reporters do n't even make as much money as printers . Us printers have got a union and reporters have n't . You take advertising salesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they 're any good . And they know what 's going on around town and get a chance to invest their money and make more . " " Being any kind of a salesman ai n't bad , " said Sam . " I do n't know , " said Henry . " I got to think it over and it depends on how you look at it . It 's the reporters that work up to be editors and even owners of papers and that 's really amounting to something . In the long run you might even  | make more money working up from a reporter than a salesman and it 'd probably be more fun  --  for me , anyhow . " " Hank , " said Jeremy , " I think you 're going to do all right . " " If working hard will do anything I 'm going to amount to something . " " That , " said Sam , " is all anybody needs in the United States of America . " " Well , " said Henry , yawning , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed pretty soon . I have to get up at six a.m. because it takes about an hour to get to the office from here . I 'll take the outside of the bed on account I have to jump up quick and turn off the alarm clock . It makes other folks here mad if I let it run long enough to wake ' em up . " CHAPTER ELEVEN Despite his weariness and despite the size of the bed and its probable superiority over Henry 's cot in the stock room of the Appian City Courier , Jeremy did n't sleep well . The bed , big as it was , seemed overcrowded with the three , and Henry tallied in his sleep . He did n't say anything in particular , but just talked . Jeremy dropped off a dozen times only to be wakened either by Sam 's turning over or by Henry 's unintelligible monologue . He was in a troubled dream when the tin alarm clock on the bureau exploded with a peevish scream . Henry bounded from bed and turned off the bell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs . For a  | moment he stood in the middle of the floor , rubbing his sandy-red head , then he turned and looked at the bed . " Hello , " said Jeremy . Sam mumbled and turned his face to the wall . " Look , " said Henry softly , " you ducks do n't have to get up yet . You can just take your time and then go out and see the sights . " " No , " said Jeremy , " we 'll get up and have breakfast with you . Come on , Brock , you 're in Chicago , Illinois , and got things to do . " Henry was hurriedly pulling into his underwear and still trying to blink the sleep from his eyes . " Well , " he said , " if you really want to get up you 'll have to move and get some clothes on . Pretty quick that privy 's going to have a waiting line . " Jeremy and Sam made the bed and waited while Henry shaved at the bureau mirror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They peered out the window in appalled silence at a vista of flat roofs , chimneys , dark red brick walls , dirty windows , refuse cans , an unpainted wooden fence in the court below , a pigeon cote constructed from a big packing box and an astonishing crisscross of clotheslines on six or eight different levels . Jeremy felt a sad constriction in his middle . He put his hand in his pocket and with his thumb caressed the wooden handle of Grandpa Bell 's clasp knife . Pretty soon now Grandpa would be stumping up to the pasture to milk old Jennifer . Then he and Grandma would eat breakfast alone . Then Grandpa would thump down to the blacksmith shop alone . Jeremy did n't want to say anything to Sam , but he suspected Sam felt much as ' he did . He marveled at Henry 's enthusiasm over his life in Chicago , but Henry 's life in Appian City must have been dreadfully unpleasant . It occurred to Jeremy , standing with Sam looking out of Henry 's window , that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain now just how correct Grandpa  | had been about Dawn 's Mill , but he had to see for himself . Well , he had seen already . Chicago was an awful place and he wanted none of it . It was really the dirt that made him sick . Maybe it was funny for him to feel that way , but blacksmith dirt was healthy and Chicago was n't . " Well , I tell you , " Henry said , scraping his throat with the razor , " we 'll have a bite of breakfast and then I 'll have to rush off . But you ducks can go around on your own all right and see the town . I 'd go to the Loop first and then fan out and see things . Just go in Marshall Field 's and wander around and you never saw anything like it . You do n't have to buy anything , but just wander around and you never dreamed of such a store . Then I 'd go out to the stockyards and , man alive , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through one of the big packing plants . They 're always glad to show visitors through and they got guides that do nothing else and that 'll open your eyes . " " How , " asked Sam faintly , " we going to find those places ? " " Easy . All you got to do is ask a policeman or a streetcar conductor . " " Wo n't they think we 're just country-jakes and tell us to go home and get the hayseed out of our hair ? " " Naw  --  that 's all bugjuice . People are here all the time from New York and Boston and every place and do n't know their way around Chicago . The country-jake is the duck who 's afraid to ask questions . When you do n't know anything ask somebody that 's got a uniform on . That 's what the smart bird does . Just remember that and you wo n't have any trouble . I 'll get home here a little after six and we 'll have supper together . " " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get back by then . " " No you wo n't  --  not if you ask questions . " Henry hurriedly washed his face , roached his red hair with a wet comb and put on his everyday cap and tight-  | fitting shoddy jacket . " Come on , " he said , " I got to get a move on . I 'll leave the door unlocked so 's you can get in any time you want . " At a lunch counter under the elevated Henry swallowed two doughnuts and a cup of coffee , urged Jeremy and Sam to look around town a couple of days before trying to find , jobs and dashed away . Sam looked up sadly from his plate of wheat cakes . " Any old time , " he said . " Well , " said Jeremy , " I reckon everybody should ought to see Chicago and here we are . " " I 've seen the damn thing , " said Sam . " And any old time I try going out to a meat packing factory and ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even want to see a flour mill any more . There 's just one thing I want to see now and that 's Dawn 's Mill and the sooner the quicker . " " I know , Sam , and I feel kind of the same way . But we 've spent the money coming here and we ca n't just rush on back home . We can stand it to knock around a couple of days and get our money 's worth . " " Do n't need to think I 'm going to try and get me a job in this stinking town . " Sam 's black eyes were belligerent . " No . Do n't think I want a job here either . " " Well , that 's what we figured on doin ; and we ai n't got too much money . Suppose we fool around here a couple days and all at once we have n't got enough money left to get home . What kind of a mess are we in then ? " Jeremy nodded . " I know . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run back home now . Everybody 'd laugh at us and then Hank 's been so fine to us we could n't just run off . What 'd he think ? " " He 'd think we did n't like the place and went back home and , as far as I 'm concerned , he would n't be thinking no lie . " " Well , that would n't be any way to act , Sam , and we 'll go to that Loop place and the stores and maybe I 'll buy  | some little present for Grandma and Grandpa and maybe something for Julie . " " All right , " Sam said , dubiously , " but we got to be careful and not spend too much money and maybe it 'd be a good thing to go to the railroad depot first and buy our tickets home and then we 'll have ' em. - , , No use being scarycat over it , Sam . We do n't have to spend any more tin than we want . " " But suppose we lose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take any chances about being stuck in this place . " " Well , " said Jeremy , " I expect we could lose railroad tickets just as easy as losing money . " " Maybe . But we could put our railroad tickets in our inside coat pockets so if any pickpockets got our money we 'd still have the tickets . " Jeremy grinned . " Could n't we just as well put enough spondulix in our inside pockets ? " " Oh , expect so . " They paid their breakfast checks and transferred enough money from their wallets to their inside pockets to pay their way home . Leaving the lunch room with toothpicks in their mouths , they were approached by a middle-aged man in a battered derby . " Say , pard , " he said to Sam , " got a match ? " " No , " said Sam , " I got no match and you better trot along while you can walk without limping . " " What you mean by that ? " the man demanded . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the man and walked off . Jeremy squinted one eye questioningly at Sam . " That duck , " said Sam , " was aiming to fusculate us . He could see we 're from the country but I showed him we 're not green . " " Well , " said Jeremy , " let 's go up and take an elevated train and go to that Loop place and see what we can see . "  | " Yeah , " said Sam , " but we got to keep our eyes open every minute  --  every last God damn minute . " They put in three hours in Marshall Field 's store and when they got out Jeremy observed that now they could say they really had seen the biggest store in the world . Loth were astonished and even a little shaken by the experience . " I never thought , " said Sam , " that I 'd ever see anything like it in my life . What gets me is why they ever held a world 's fair here when they got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would pay money to go to a world 's fair when they can go in Marshall Field 's for nothing . " They were standing on the sidewalk in front of the store , holding their purchases in their hands , becoming inured slightly now to the confusing flow of pedestrians about them , the noise of traffic and babble of voices . " Yeah , " said Jeremy . " You know what I kept thinking ? I kept thinking that somebody had rubbed a lamp and here was the Arabian Nights come to life only modern . I do n't know . There 's something unreal about everything . " He looked at Sam , whose black Sunday suit and black hat looked somewhat in need of brushing now and whose gay bow tie was pulled down a little from his collar . He took hold of Sam 's arm . " God , Sam , " he said , " I 'm sure as hell glad you 're here with me . It 'd be kind of awful to go through this all alone . " Sam nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking nonsense there , boy , " he said . " I know just what you mean , but I feel a lot different about Chicago after this morning . They started walking down the street aimlessly and after a while Sam said , " Jerry , if you wanted a new shotgun would you get one of these new hammerlesses . " My old shotgun 's all right , " said Jeremy . " I know , but if you lost it or broke it or something . " " Well , do n't know . I guess a hammerless is all right , but Bill Lowney 's looks kind of raked to me. "  | " Yeah . But what I was thinking about is I think they 're dangerous . Just by looking at it you ca n't tell whether or not it 's cocked . " " Yeah . Well , I do n't know . My shotgun was my father 's and it suits me all right . " " Sure , " said Sam . " Now , " said Jeremy , " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan . " " Yeah . We do n't want to miss that . " " No . I guess that 's one of the main things . But first we 'd better find us some kind of an eating house that 's not too expensive . I could do with some groceries . " A bell had been ringing which was something like a street car but steadier and more incessant and as it grew louder a policeman on the corner began shouting and waving his arms at cabs and drays to make way . Then a red fire wagon plunged into view with red-hatted firemen clinging desperately to its sides and the excited white horses running at a mad gallop . The.wagon flashed past and Jeremy and Sam stood on the curbing staring after it . Then there was another and larger wagon covered with long ladders and drawn by three horses , and it was followed by a steamer also drawn by three horses and black smoke poured from its stack while its bell rang wildly . Three young men were pedaling madly after the engine on bicycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was husky and his eyes wide . He darted down the sidewalk with Jeremy at his heels . They dodged around men , women and children on the sidewalk , running at top speed when they could run , side-stepping , jumping off the sidewalk into the street to avoid a bright-parasoled perambulator , and back on the sidewalk again with the black smoke of the pumper trailing back only a block ahead and its bell loud in their ears . They covered three blocks in this manner and then a helmeted giant of a policeman loomed up on the corner and barred Sam 's passage with his club .  | " Wait a minute there , wait a minute ! " he bellowed . " Just where you think you 're going ? " " There 's a fire up there somewhere , ai n't there ? " Sam panted . " Are you a fireman , maybe ? " " Well ? " " Well  --  you look a little out before I run the pair of ye in . Now go on back the way ye come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . " There we go , " said Jeremy . " Just country-jakes making fools out of ourselves . " " Yeah . But I 'd sure enough like to see that fire . " " Maybe we could go around the corner and back and find it . " " Yeah . " They turned the corner and walked for perhaps a mile but found nothing except stores , saloons , restaurants , shops , thousands of pedestrians , bicycles , streetcars and horse-drawn traffic . At a lunch counter each had a platter of pork and beans and bread and butter for ten cents . Then they went out on the street again , determined to find Lake Michigan , but still a little reluctant to speak to a policeman . Remembering Henry Eisk 's advice to ask men in uniform , they approached a sailor on a corner . " Excuse me , " said Jeremy , " but would you tell us where we can find Lake Michigan ? " The sailor was chewing on a match stick and he looked first at Jeremy and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , " he said , " and I would n't be interested in a little game or a blonde either . " " What you mean by that ? " Jeremy asked , puzzled . " On your way , mate . Your getup 's a giveaway . " Abruptly , the sailor crossed the street , his wide-bottomed trousers flapping around his ankles . " Now I 'll be dad-burned , " said Sam . " I think that sailor  | thought we were slickers . I guess nobody trusts anybody in Chicago . " " Well , " said Jeremy , " I expect we 'd better ask a policeman . " In the next block a group of men stood languidly on the sidewalk peering at a store front where an American flag was painted in colors with an ornate sign reading OLD GLORY EMPLOYMENT AGENCY . Several blackboards were covered with writing , some of which was in red chalk , some in white and some in blue . Jeremy and Sam stopped . On a sidewalk easel was printed : " Construction Gang Fry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powder Man , Colorado , Transportation . Man and wife , Farm . " " This , " said Jeremy , " is one of the places Hank was talking about . " " Yeah , " said Sam . " Look at that big sign . " An eight-foot blackboard was filled with red and white printing and script : REAL OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS ! For hardy men not afraid of work who want steady employment with good chance of advancement . Big wages for right Men In new Lumber Camp in Sunny South . TRANSPORTATION Why Shiver in Northern Winters ? Houses provided for men with families . Steady married men preferred . But New Boarding House for Bachelors . Special Inducements for Experienced Timber Cutters , Mechanics and Mill Hands .  | $3 A DAY FOR RIGHT MEN ! ! ! Work for one of biggest , most reliable lumber firms in world and share in rewards for making new mill a success ! Come in and Inquire ! " Now , " said Jeremy , " that might be a very good job ? if anybody was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small cap and bright-striped shirt also was looking at the sign . He turned his head toward Jeremy and said , " Not to me , it do n't look like a good job . " " What 's wrong with it ? " Jeremy asked . The young man sniffed . " Way out in the woods that way , and what 's wrong with it ? Not for me , chum . What you going to do for fun ? " " Well , there ought to be something to do . " " Yeah . There ought to be . But is there ? I 'd rather starve to death in good old Chi than make good money way back in the woods someplace . What good is money in the woods ? " The young man turned abruptly and walked away . Jeremy and Sam sauntered on . " Just ca n't figure people , " said Sam . " Why would anybody on earth rather live in Chicago than any other place ? " " Beats me , " said Jeremy . " Now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me that impression and that job back on the blackboard is probably better than any job he ever had . " " Yeah . And it 'd probably make a man out of him if anything could . Notice his face ? That duck was sickly . If he 'd get out in the woods for a while doing a man 's work swinging an ax or pulling a crosscut saw he 'd feel like another man . Probably add twenty years to his life . " They paused and looked in the window of a pawnshop  | at a collection of revolvers , blackjacks , brass knuckles , daggers , guitars , spyglasses , cameras and watches . " Beats me , " said Jeremy . " Of course I think better of Chicago than I did this morning . " Sam frowned . " But I still would n't live here for anything . " " Oh , no . But it seems like a lot of people would . Take Hank and take that fellow and I expect about everybody else in town or else they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumber mill jobs . Three dollars a day is real money . Why , that 's eighteen dollars a week . " " Of course you 'd have to pay your board out of that . " " Suppose you do . In a lumber camp they could n't possibly charge you more than three or four dollars a week for board and room and that would leave you fourteen or fifteen dollars a week clear . That 's practically as good as the harvest fields without any of this sleeping in barns and riding on freight trains . " " Sure 'd be a lot better than hanging around Chicago and half starving to death , " said Sam . " If I was here out of a job I 'd take practically anything to get me out of town and there probably is n't a job in Chicago where you start in at three dollars a day . " Jeremy turned his back to the lethal display in the window . " Well , " he said , " of course the sign did n't say they 'd start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . I expect they just mean three dollars a day for men that 've had a lot of experience working in lumber camps . " " Well , it did n't say exactly that , Sam . " " Just what did it say ? " Jeremy pondered . " Do n't think it was very plain . Let 's go back and look . " " Oh , what difference does it make ? " " I 'd just like to know . Come on . "  | They walked back to the Old Glory Employment Agency and looked again at the blackboard . " Well , " said Sam , " it says three dollars a day for the right men . But it do n't say what they figure is a right man . I do n't know . " " Just above that , " said Jeremy , " it says , Special inducements for experienced timber cutters , mechanics and mill hands . ' The special inducements probably include the three dollars a day . " " Do n't expect they 'll find many experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell . But they can find mechanics all right . I 'm a mechanic , " said Jeremy . " Yeah , but not a sawmill mechanic . I 'm a mill hand too , but not a sawmill hand . " " Well , Sam , I do n't know . If they have to advertise this way and pay money like that I expect they ca n't always get just exactly the kind of men they want . I 'll bet if we told ' em the exact truth they 'd give us jobs and tickets down South . " Sam looked at Jeremy with open mouth . " Holy mackeral , " he said , " we do n't want any of their jobs . " " What 'd we come to Chicago for ? " " Well  --  I thought you 'd changed your mind and was all set for going back home . " Jeremy noded his head seriously and rubbed his jaw . " Sure , " he said , " I know . But look , Sam , I 've been thinking . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were going to get jobs and be away for a while . If we bust right back home after two or three days it 'll be kind of a joke and it 'll do things to us inside too . God knows , I do n't want to stay in Chicago at all , but , Sam , I tell you I 've been doing myself some thinking and I just do n't know . " Sam 's mouth had closed and closed tightly . He shifted the small packages in his hands and in them were a 25-cent briar pipe for his father , identical to the one Jeremy had got  | for Grandpa Bell at Marshall Field 's , and a scarf for his mother like the one Jeremy bought for Grandma Bell , and a small pink kerosene bed lamp for Judith Dennis . Sam 's black hat was on the back of his head and one lock of dark hair hung over his forehead almost to his contracted brows . Sam licked his lips and then spoke explosively . " Bugs , " Ile said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it 's pretty easy to get upset the way we were early this morning and I think if we go busting right back home tomorrow we 're liable to be sorry for it . " " We ca n't stay around very long  --  not without getting jobs . " " That 's what I mean . And we do n't want to stay around Chicago anyhow so I think maybe we ought to go in there and just ask about those sawmill jobs . Hell , it wo n't cost anything and we sure do n't have to take any job if we do n't want it . " " Why ask about a job that you do n't want ? " " How you going to know for sure you do n't want it until you ask ? " " I got a job now  --  or will have if I get home soon enough . " " Old Hosmer 'll have a job for you right enough even if you do n't get back before spring . " " I 'll be home before winter unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel much like that . " " Well , " said Jeremy , " I 'm going to find out about those jobs anyhow just for curiosity sake . If you ' do n't want to go in you wait out here for me . " " No . If you 're set on going in there I 'll go along just to keep you out of trouble . " Inside the door they approached the first desk , and a brisk young man with pink cheeks , a very red mouth and a small black mustache smiled at them genially.  | " We wanted to ask , " said Jeremy , " about those sawmill jobs down South . " " Oh , yes . One of the finest oportunities we 've had in a long time . Had any sawmill experience ? " " Well  --  not exactly . But we 've done quite a lot of wood chopping and pulling crosscut saws . " " What work have you been doing ? " " Well , me , I 'm a blacksmith and my partner 's been working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Either of you married ? " " Oh , no . " " That 's all right . Course these people  --  one of the finest companies in America  --  they prefer married men as a general thing because men with families are steadier . You know how it is . Young bucks sometimes like to change around . " He smiled again , and picked up a lead pencil . " Now what are your names ? " " Well , " said Jeremy , " we have n't decided definite yet . Would we get that three dollars a day you 've got on the blackboard ? " The young man pursed his red lips . " Eventually , surely , but I could n't say for certain what your salaries would be right away . If the superintendent was well impressed with you  --  and I should say he ought to be  --  he might well put you down for top salary right away . But perhaps , until you found your niche in the mill , it might be a little less . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still smiling . " That I could n't say . But I 'd think a couple of sturdy citizens like you should be worth at least two-fifty a day . Well , I just ca n't emphasize enough the advantages for a couple of young fellows like you of working in a fine , big , new mill where there just is n't any limit to your opportunities . If you 're willing to work and show ability you could be foremen in no time and be right in line to be transferred to another mill as superintendent . And it 's glorious out there in the timber .  | Puts new life into you . Frankly , boys , I 'll tell you if I had the physical strength you 'd never find me behind a desk in Chicago . I 'd be right down there in the longleaf pines living the kind of a life a man ought to live  --  close to nature and eating three square meals a day instead of grabbing a little sandwich at noon the way I do here . And what meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oh , man . " " Well , " said Sam into Jeremy 's ear , " I got no kick about the grub I get at home . " " Now , " said the young man , " if you boys are interested , we 've got a car making up tomorrow  --  some nice young fellows about your age and some older men with their families . All of ' em are fine folks that like God 's outdoors and smart enough to want to get in on the ground floor in a new project with one of America 's biggest and finest corporations ? the Wazee-Knight Lumber Company . " " You 're sending down a whole carload of folks ? " " That 's right . " The young man laughed . " You might say you have your private car because you do n't have to change cars from the time you get on here until you reach the mill . " " Well , thank you ever so much , " said Sam . " We 'll think it over and ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are only two or three places left , " he said . " I could n't hold them for you and they may be gone in even half an hour . " Jeremy looked at Sam and Sam 's black brows were pulled together . " Well , I tell you , " said Jeremy . " We 'll talk it over . If we 're not back in fifteen minutes ? " " All right , " the young man said . " I 'll hold open two places for you for fifteen minutes but no longer . " Jeremy and Sam went out the door and down the street again in front of the second hand store . Sam was still frowning . " Well , Jerry , " he said , " I do n't  | know . I do n't know what we want to figure on jobs like that for . We 've got jobs back home . " " Sam , " said Jeremy patiently , " we had those jobs when we left Dawn 's Mill . What 'd we leave for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . " " You 'll know soon enough if we go right back . I know how you feel because I feel pretty much the same way but I know that feeling is n't going to last . Now look , partner , we left home on account we wanted to get out in the world a little and see things and have some adventures . We left home because we wanted to stretch our legs and live before we got too old and set to enjoy those kind of things . " " I reckon I 'm too old now . " " No you 're not . You just have n't busted loose yet and as soon as you really get busted loose from home you 're going to feel free and wonderful and enjoy life like you never did before . I can see how it 'll be , Sam , even if I do n't feel exactly that way here in Chicago . Once in a while I get a touch of it even here and I just know how it 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our big adventure , Sam . We got here yesterday and rode on an elevated train and today we went through Marshall Field 's big store and if we go home tomorrow what kind of an adventure is that going to be to remember ? " " Seems like , " said Sam , " that we 've been away a long time now . " " Yeah , I know . But how 's it going to seem a week from now ? It 'll be like we 'd never been away . It 'll be just the same as after we went to the carnival . " " You want to take those jobs down South ? " " It 'd be an adventure . " Sam chewed his lip . " I do n't know . It might turn out to be a hell of a lot more than you bargained for . " " Suppose it did . We 're strong and healthy and if other birds can stand it we ought to . That 's what makes it an ad-  | venture , Sam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a chance to go down and look it over and see a lot of country we 'd probably never see otherwise . If we do n't like it there 's no law says you got to stay on a job just because you took it . " A plump and overdressed young woman in sweeping changeable silk minced slowly past . She gave them a sidelong glance of appraisal , then looked straight ahead as Sam stared . " Jesus , " he said . " The thing is , " said Jeremy , " we 're going to be sorry if we do n't on account we 'll never know what it was . " " We might be a lot sorrier if we do . Look . Now suppose we go to hell and gone down there in the South and we do n't like it at all . How we going to get back ? " " We could get back all right . Even if we do n't like it , it wo n't kill us to work a couple of weeks and save our money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get there in the first place . The whole thing is , Sam , we wanted to get away from a home a while , did n't we ? " " Well , I guess we did . " " All right . Now we 're away from home and I think we 're batty to go tearing right back in two days . I do n't say I think we ought to stay away all winter or anything like that . But I 'm sure game to take a chance if you are . " " Jerry , I do n't know . I feel funny and unreal and I do n't like it . I want to get my feet on some ground that has n't got brick or rock on top of it . " " Sure , I know . " " I do n't like all this noise and I 'd like to breathe some air that do n't smell funny . " " Sure . I feel the same way . And I reckon somebody who was born and raised in Chicago and never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all in getitng used to it . " " By God , " Sam blustered , " I do n't want to get used to it . "  | " I 'm not arguing for us to stay in Chicago at all . It 'd be different down South . " " Yeah . But I might feel the same way down there about different things . " " It 'd only last a few days and then you would n't be bothered with it again . The thing you got to do , Sam is to remember how you felt in Dawn 's Mill . " " I felt fine in Dawn 's Mill . " " But you wanted to get away just as bad as I did . You got to remember that , Sam , and not think about how you feel now but how you 'll feel if we go home tomorrow and we go right back into the old humdrum business and we 'll never in the world have nerve enough to go away again . I tell you that 's what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidewalk . " I tell you , Sam , I 've been thinking mighty hard about this business and I think that sawmill thing might be pretty dad-burn good . But even if it turns out bad , I 'd rather go through a few weeks of it being very bad and know about it than to go back home now . I 'd rather take a risk on it because I know exactly how it 's going to be for me if I go tearing home now like a singed cat . I 'd go through the rest of my life being scared of the world and I do n't want to be that way . " Sam raised his head and his lips were tight . " You mean , " he asked , " that you 're going to take that job whether I do or not ? " " Do n't want to bust up with you , Sam , " said Jeremy , firmly , " but I ai n't going home just yet . I just am not . I sure wish you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good parts will be only half as much fun and the bad parts will be worse . " " Well , " said Sam , " if you feel that way about it , I guess I can stand it if you can . Come on before that fellow gives the jobs to somebody else . "  | CHAPTER TWELVE Jeremy woke and leaned from the window when the train stopped but there was nothing to see except the vague shape of big trees and the glint of stars in water beside the track . There was a tremendous uproar of frogs from all sides  --  big booming bullfrogs . The air was fresh but heavy with smells alien to Jeremy 's nostrils . Pulling his head back in the window he looked over the dimly lit , old smoking car and nearly everyone seemed to be asleep except the bride and groom three seats back on the other side of the car . She looked pale and worn and he  --  Charley Lewis  --  was talking to her softly and smilingly while she rested her ash-blonde head on his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the entire Williams family ahead . There were twenty-one men on the car , nine women and thirteen children , including fourteen-year-old Floyd Williams , Jr. , who was scrawny and sallow like his father and probably no more mature than most country boys of eleven or twelve . This was the second night out of Chicago and everyone was near exhaustion . The picnic spirit of the first day was gone . The topics of conversation which kept groups going most of the first night had been sifted to the bottom of the barrel . The card games and the interest in new scenes of the second day were over . Nothing remained but disheveled weariness and apprehension over the morrow .  | The Marshall baby began to cry and Mrs. Marshall sat up , brushed the stringy dark hair from her eyes and gathered the child up from the turned-over black oilcloth seat to feed it . Jeremy got to his feet , carefully stepped over Sam 's legs and walked to the rear of the car toward the men 's toilet . Mr. Rogers , the guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled , Minnie Hermon , or the Curse of Rum . " All right , Mr. Rogers ? " Jeremy asked . " Go ahead . " Mr. Rogers had a cartridge belt around his blue-shirted middle and a big revolver in a holster . He had red whiskers and wore a broad-brimmed black hat . When he was not in the rear seat of the car the back door was locked . The front door was locked all of the time . When Jeremy returned he paused . " Lots of frogs out there , " he said . Mr. Rogers did not look up from his book . " Yep , " he said . " Some of ' em big as rabbits . " " Where are we ? " Jeremy asked . " Do n't know . Some place in Arkansas , I reckon . " " Know what we 're stopping for ? " " Nope . " " Still going to get there in the morning ? " " Yep . " Jeremy went back to his seat and Sam was awake . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Arkansas . " Sam looked out the window . " Sure some place . " A train roared past on the opposite side of the car and when it had gone Sam said , " We just went on a side track to let a real train go by . " Jeremy yawned . " Yep . " Sam slumped farther down into the seat . " We 're going to like this . We 're going to love this . "  | Jeremy did n't answer . Sam 's black hair was tousled . He put his knees against the slick black seat ahead . " By God , " he said , " they always told me this was a free country . But the minute you take a job they can lock you up in a railroad car like a murderer or bandit with some kind of a constable ready to fill you full of lead if you try and escape . " " No use saying anything more , " said Jeremy . " You know how it is . " " Yep . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Old Nick . " " If God made everything , " said Jeremy , " that means he made Old Nick too . So Old Nick is n't responsible for the way he 's made . " Sam grinned . " I told you so . " " I do n't like the way this thing looks any better than you , " said Jeremy , " but still you can see the way it is . The company signs up some workers in Chicago and pays their way down to the mill . So there 'll always be some crooks who want to go to St. Louis or Memphis that 'll sign up for a job just to get a free ride down and would jump off the train when they got where they wanted to go . It 's not the company 's fault that there are crooks and you ca n't blame ' em for wanting to protect themselves , I reckon . " " I guess , " said Sam , " we 're lucky they did n't put handcuffs on us . Hell , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly on his side facing the window and Jeremy stretched his own legs into the aisle . An hour later they were wakened by voices outside and the car jolted and banged as it was switched back and forth . Then they were moving slowly again and the wheels screeched painfully as they made a sharp turn . Then lightning flashed , wind whipped the trees and rain came down with a violence which forced them to close the window . Within five minutes the car was hot , fetid and almost suffo-  | cating , but the storm lasted less than an hour and Sam wrestled the window up again . Dawn found them puffing alternately through flat timberland and beside swamps where spreading-holed cypress grew from black water which reached the edge of the railroad embankment . Jeremy dozed off again and woke as they creaked around a bend into a flat clearing . There was a glimpse of buildings in ranks  --  new buildings of raw , white lumber and other buildings brown with the bark of unfinished slabs . Then the track straightened and the locomotive 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam pushed the hair from his eyes and stretched his arms . " Well , " he said , solemnly , " I expect this is it . " There were voices outside and then in the rear of the car . Then a big black-bearded man in black slouch hat , black suit and black rubber boots strode up the aisle and unlocked the front door of the car . He turned and spoke pleasantly . " Well , folks , " he said , " here you are at the WazeeKnight camp and welcome . We hope you find it pleasant here because the Wazee-Knight company has found it 's more profitable to all concerned when conditions are pleasant and the people are contented and happy . Now suppose you all get out of the car  --  you 're probably tired of it sure enough by now  --  and do n't forget any of your baggage and we 'll call the roll and see that you 're all here . Then we 'll get you registered and assign the married folks to houses and the single men to places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast with the compliments of the company at the boardinghouse just to welcome you here . All right , let 's see how quick we can all get out and line up beside the car and the quicker we do it the quicker we 'll get straightened out and have breakfast . " The man grinned through his black beard down at tow-  | headed little Jennie Williams . He chucked her under the chin . " You glad to be here , Sis ? " She twisted shyly . " I guess so . " The man laughed . " All right , folks . Let 's hustle it up . " Jeremy and Sam were out quickly and the air was cool and fresh and damp and scented with sawdust and mud . The little locomotive sizzled and its tall stack was covered with a wire spark arrester . There were spark arresters also atop the high steel stacks that rose from the mill . Blue smoke drifted up in the still air . The passengers were lining up nervously , parents admonishing children and children gabbling petulantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the mill and on it were several flat cars filled with new lumber . Puddles of water glistened in the open area between the sprawling mill buildings and the rows of cottages . Near the cottages were two large buildings . The larger building was graced with a covered porch and a large black-and-white sign reading WAZEE-KNIGHT LUMBER CO . Commissary . There was no sign on the other building , but smoke was rising from a screen-covered pipe in the rear . Near where Jeremy stood was a strong post with a sign affixed and he stepped forward a couple steps and turned to read it ? " Wazee-Knight R. R. All persons are prohibited from trespassing this right-of-way except on matters of business . Violators will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law . " The black-bearded man was standing forward with a paper in his hand . He had been joking with Mr. Rogers whose revolver holster hung low on his thigh and now he spoke laughingly to Jeremy . " Understand that all right , bub ? " he asked . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes who do n't know that a train  | runs faster than they can . Then we have to pick ' em up in a basket . " " What 's it say ? " Sam asked . " Says keep off the railroad track or they 'll have you arrested . " Sam squinted one eye and looked thoughtfully at the sky . The overalled engineer was approaching . " All right , " the bearded man called . " Everybody out of the car ? Nobody forget anything ? All right , Joe , get that old teakettle out of here . " The engineer went back to his cab and , with bell ringing , the locomotive puffed away with its three empty flatcars , one red boxcar and the dingy coach . Then the bearded man called the roll from his paper , lumping each family into one name such as , " Floyd Williams , wife and three children . " " Now , " he said , " there are a few simple things that I 'd better explain right at the beginning so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any questions you might as well ask ' em now . In the first place my name is Tom Parsons and I 'm assistant superintendent of the mill and I 'm sort of mayor of the town . It 's my job to look after the people here and when you have any complaints or trouble or want to know about something I 'm the feller to see . I 'm easy to see . I 've got a room over there in the office but I wander around a lot here looking after things and when you see me all you 've got to do is holler out , ' Oh , Mr. Parsons . ' " He laughed at that and some of the people laughed with him . " Well , that 's the way it is . Your troubles are my troubles so I hope there are n't too many of them . Now , I suppose some of you folks have wondered a little bit about us bringing you clear down here and wondered why we could n't find enough good men down South to operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you how that is . In the first place ,  | Mr. Wazee and Mr. Knight are Northern gentlemen and all their leading bosses are Northerners and we 've just found out from experience that we have better luck with Northern workmen . I 'll tell you folks why because you all came down here from Chicago and I think you 'll understand . The truth of it is that Southerners are too dern lazy to be any good . Wazee-Knight wants men with some get-up-and-git and ambition and the truth is that Southern white men have been so used to having niggers do the work that they do n't want to work themselves and the truth is that niggers just have n't got any get-up-and-git and you have to drive ' em every minute . That 's why we 're so glad to get ambitious Northerners like you folks . We know you 've got ambition or you would n't have come down here in the first place to better your conditions . " The people lined along the railroad track with their grips and bundles and boxes were looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennie Williams ' shrill voice spoke up , " Mama , I 'm hungry . " Tom Parsons laughed . " Just a little bit more , Sis , and then we 'll have breakfast . Well , there 's one thing I want to speak about because I 've known men who signed things without reading them and I ca n't understand anybody doing a thing like that , but I know they do . All of you men look too intelligent for any of you to think the Old Glory Employment Agency in Chicago is in business for their health and they got you this opportunity and you agreed in writing that your first week 's pay goes to them . " There were a few gasps and Jeremy and Sam exchanged glances . " Jesus , " said Sam softly , " I did n't see anything like that . " " Must have been in pretty small printing . " " I think myself , " Tom Parsons went on , " that that arrangement is very fair . If we did n't think so , naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the usual method with interstate employment agencies . You get your money 's  | worth all right and if anybody had any objections to that kind of arrangement he should have made them before he signed . You 've all made a written agreement and signed it and it 's too late to kick now . " " Well , mister . " Long-necked Floyd Williams was holding up his hand . " Can I say something ? " " Go ahead . " Parsons was no longer smiling . " Well , I just wanted to say if I signed that it 's all right and maybe I 'd even signed it if they had n't been in such a hurry and I read it all through and understood it . But I got my wife here now and my little girl and little boy and my bigger boy and only a little bit more than a dollar cash money and we all got to eat and ? " " You 're all right , my friend , " said Parsons . " Your name 'll be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of credit at the commissary . Your wife can go there this morning and buy anything you need in the way of victuals and working clothes . " Floyd Williams ' worried frown left his face . Mrs. Williams smiled . " Well , that 's fine and dandy , mister , " he said . " Just for a minute I did n't know what we was going to do if I did n't get nothing at all for my first week . " " You 're all right . You 're all all right . You got credit for house rent , groceries and everything you need . Single men got credit at the boardinghouse and you men can even get tobacco . But no booze . Wazee-Knight do n't stand for boozers . I guess that settles everything . Rogers , you take the single men to the boardinghouse . I 'll take the married folks up and let ' em pick their homes . The bell will ring at the boardinghouse in half an hour , about , and you 'll all have breakfast . " Jeremy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers across the muddy flat , avoiding puddles of water , while the other group of men , women and children struggled with their more abundant baggage in a diagonal course behind Parsons .  | One mill had started running while Parsons talked and now the monstrous whine of the saw filled the air . From a mountain of yellow sawdust to the right of the sprawling mill buildings a column of sickly smoke rose and then spread languidly like fog to filter through the ranks of scrub timber in the rear . Jeremy felt oddly nervous and apprehensive . Carrying his canvas telescope in his left hand , his right hand automatically found the reassurance of Grandpa Bell 's clasp knife in his pocket . Stroking the smooth wooden handle with his thumb now was almost a pagan ritual , the spinning of a prayer wheel , an almost unconscious but nevertheless comforting act of fetishism . He looked at Sam and Sam 's face was stolid and weary . Sam 's ear was dirty . There was black fuzz growing along his jaw . They all followed Rogers into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper floor , their muddy feet adding to the discoloration of the new boards in the center of the steps . The red-bearded Rogers turned when they all had clumped behind him to the big , lowroofed room at the head of the stairs . In the room were several tables of rough lumber , half a dozen wooden settees and a clutter of rustic chairs . Two overalled but pale men were playing checkers at a table . Another man sprawled on a settee reading a tattered-backed book . They all looked up at the new group with no signs of interest and then returned to their game and reading . Rogers spoke in a monotone . " This , " he said , " is the recreation room and something you wo n't find in many lumber camps but Mr. Wazee and Mr. Knight believe a contented workman is a good workman and religious services are held here every Sunday morning . Now we will go into the dorm'tory and you 'll each find yourself a bunk and downstairs on the far side of the boarding house you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need towels and soap you got credit at the commissary which is the big building right up the line . "  | They trooped behind Rogers through a door into the long dormitory which was dimly lighted by small square windows on each wooden wall . There were two rows of double bunks , perhaps thirty on a side , carelessly knocked together from unplaned lumber , and each covered with a gray cotton blanket . Down the center aisle at intervals of ten or twelve feet was a row of big tin cuspidors and on a stand beside the door was a red water bucket with a tin dipper . From nails in the bunk uprights were hanging slickers , trousers , overalls , shirts , underwear , coats , sweaters and hats . Under the lower bunks were valises , boxes , canvas bags , shoes and rubber boots . There was a smell of new lumber , stale food from the kitchen below , tar , dank clothing and sweaty men . Someone in the group emitted a low whistle . " Vacant bunks down toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nice son-of-a-bitch , " someone said , " if this shebang ever caught on fire at night with just one door . " Rogers turned quickly . " Who said that ? " There was no answer . " It 's your business to see that it do n't catch on fire , " Rogers said . " And there 's no smoking allowed in this dorm ' - tory at any time . Understand that ? " Three-quarters of the way down the room the bunks were vacant . Jeremy and Sam , being at the head of the column , moved over to the first vacancy . " I 'll take the upper , " said Jeremy . " Oh , no . We 'll draw straws . " " No . Matter of fact , I 'd rather have the upper if it 's all the same with you . " Sam swallowed and looked closely at Jeremy . " All right with me . " A red-checked , thin young man was lying in the adjoining upper berth with the gray blanket pulled up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right now , " Rogers ' voice called . " All right , you men . Give me a little attention . Get yourself settled right away and you 'll have time to wash up if you want before your breakfast bell rings . And right after breakfast Mr. Parsons and Mr. Keller want to see you at the office and will put you on the jobs you 're to do . " " Where 's the office ? " someone asked . " It 's the painted building up toward the railroad with the sign Office ' on it . If you ca n't read get somebody to lead you . " Rogers marched down the line of cuspidors , banging his muddy heels on the floor and his holster bounced against his thigh as he swung through the door . " Oh , you poor sons of bitches , " said the young man in the adjoining bunk . " What you mean ? " Jeremy demanded . " Oh , you poor sons of bitches . Oh , your poor suckers . " Sam was shoving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat . " What you talking about ? " The young man brought his arms out from under the cotton blanket and clasped his hands behind his head . " I mean you got sucked into it just like I did  --  just like everybody . I mean you 're stuck here until this whole section is timbered over unless you die of chills and fever first or get crippled or killed or unless you 'd rather put in five years or so on a chain gang . " " Now , just a minute , " said Jeremy tensely . " You fellows got any money ? " the young man asked . " Maybe we have and maybe we have n't , " said Sam . " What 's it to you ? " " Nothing to me , brother . But if you 've got any tin take a fool 's advice and do what I tell you . When you go to the office you tell ' em you 've decided you do n't want to work here . You tell ' em you 'll pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where 'd you come from ? Chicago ? "  | " Yeah . " " I thought so . You tell ' ern you 'll pay the twenty-four dollars and a half you owe for railroad fare from Chicago and ? " " We do n't owe any railroad fare from Chicago , " said Jeremy . The young man laughed pityingly . He shook his head inside his clasped hands . " Oh , you poor suckers . " " Look , " said Jeremy , " I do n't know what they did with you , but the company brought us down here free and even gave us box lunches  --  good box lunches  --  all the way down and made a point they were the compliments of the company . " Jeremy looked at Sam . " Is n't that right ? " Sam nodded lugubriously . " Yeah . They said that . " " Oh , those box lunches , " said the young man sadly . " Oh , you poor suckers . But you think back hard and see if they ever said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't , brother , they did n't . They advanced your fare and it 's twenty-four-fifty from Chicago and you 're paying it back every cent before you ever get clearance out of this camp and you never , never , never are going to pay it back unless you got the spondulix right now . " Jeremy put his telescope under the lower bunk . " Bugs , " he said under his breath . " Come on , Sam , let 's go wash before breakfast . " Three bunks toward the door a sallow , middle-aged man called , " He ai n't joshing you a bit , boy . " " Come on , Sam , " Jeremy repeated . Then he turned to the young man . " What , " he demanded , " you doing in bed this time of day ? " " I 'm sick , " said the young man cheerfully . " Sick ? Do n't look very sick to me . " Just as cheerfully , the young man said , " You should seen me an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got my fever now . " He laughed . " You 'll know about all that soon enough . "  | Jeremy and Sam went back down the muddy stairs and outside to a wooden trough where eight or ten of their fellow travelers were pumping water and washing and scraping off their beards . A few rods beyond was a slab privy twenty-five feet long , two other sheds and a huge pile of cooking wood sawed from bark-covered slabs . Farther back fifty feet or so was a pile of rusting tin cans and other refuse over which a cloud of flies hovered . At the end of the line at the trough a shambling , bignosed man named Grossman stood shirtless , wiping the back of his neck with a flimsy towel . He grinned at Jeremy and Sam . " If you ai n't got towels and soap , " he said , " you can get it at the com'sary up there . But you 're both welcome to a lather off my soap and a swipe of my towel if you do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jeremy . " Pay you back when we get ours . " He hung his coat on a nail and took Crossman 's bar of yellow soap . " How you like the looks of things ? " Grossman asked . " Well , I do n't know , " said Jeremy . " Have n't seen enough of it yet . " Sam shook his head . " Duck up there in the bed room was saying we 're in the soup . " He hung his coat beside Jeremy 's and rolled up his sleeves . " How you mean , in the soup ? " " Said we all owe the company twenty-four-fifty for railroad fare from Chicago on top of a week 's pay to the Old Glory Employment Agency . " Jeremy lathered his hands and then scrubbed his face . " Oh , " he sputtered , " that duck had a lot of things to say . " " Well , " said Grossman , " you 'll find soreheads in every community . I do n't know , but these Wazee-Knight folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're here  | and we got jobs . What the hell . If we do n't like it , we can haul out . " " That 's what this duck was saying , " Sam put it . " Here , " said Jeremy , handing Crossman 's soap to Sam . " This duck was saying we could n't haul out , " Sam said , " unless we paid off the employment agency and the railroad fare first and he called the week 's pay ten or twelve dollars and that would look like we only get two dollars a day instead of three . " What of it ? " said Jeremy , taking Crossman 's towel . " Is twelve dollars a week bad pay ? And you can work up , I guess . " " That bird , " said Crossman , " was probably a Socialist or something and never heard that this is a free country . Nobody can make anybody work on a job when he wants to quit in the United States of America and they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't . " " Sure , " said Jeremy . " That bird was batty . " Sam scrubbed his ears and then hunted for a dry spot on Crossman 's towel . " Hope you 're right , " he said , " but I ai n't very happy about the way this place smells . " Jeremy laughed and put on his coat . " Never knew you to be happy about the way any place smelled unless it smelled pretty strong of female . " " This place , " said Sam , " do n't smell of female . I do n't know what it smells of but it 's not good and I never thought I 'd ever come to it in the world , but I 'd rather be in Chicago than here . " A bell was ringing from the front of the building and they went around and in and sat at benches with the other new arrivals , men , women and children , and had breakfast . Breakfast was corn-meal mush and molasses , thick , limp bacon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee with condensed milk . Paradoxically , the flies were exceptionally full of life but bent on quick suicide . When a Mrs. Seward asked if there was any milk for  | her little girl the waiter mumbled something and presently a smiling woman of huge girth waddled from the kitchen bearing a tin cup . " Sorry , honey , " she boomed . " We do n't ordinary have milk here ' cause this is just the men 's eating house , but it just happened we had a little left from last night when we made a puddin' ' and here ' t is . You can buy milk mostly , if you want it , from the com'sary . " Jennie Williams ' shrill voice spoke up . " Mama , I want some milk too . " The fat woman laughed . " Too bad , sweetheart . That 's all there is , but your mama can get you some after breakfast . " Then the black-bearded and beaming Parsons banged in the door , no longer wearing his rubber boots , and called out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're through eating you can all come along with me up to the office to be interviewed for what jobs you 're best at and the womenfolks can take the little ones back to their new homes and do what shopping they want at the commissary . Mr. Goldman is manager of the commissary and I 'm sure you 'll find him and his clerks very helpful . He 's got all your husbands ' names and you just have to sign the slips . " The men followed Parsons back across the open field and around the end of the mill to the white-painted office building where they lined up outside to await their turns before the interviewer . Floyd Williams stood uneasily chewing tobacco in front of Jeremy . " How 's your house , Mr. Williams ? " Jeremy asked . Williams spat and nodded his head . " Good . All right . Three rooms and two good double beds . We got to get a cot for little Jennie . Couple rocking chairs and a bench and a table and kitchen chairs and a good stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backhouse for three houses and my old woman do n't like that very well , but maybe I can  | find time to make us one of our own . And it 's a little step to the pump but it 's first come first served in this world and the folks that was here earlier naturally picked houses closer to the pump . Ca n't blame ' em for that . " " You get the house free ? " Jeremy asked . Floyd Williams laughed and spat again . " You know anything you get free in this world ? No , I 'll pay twenty dollars a month rent . " Jeremy whistled . " Does seem a bit steep but they pay good wages and Mr. Parsons explained the rent money goes to keep up the town and we 're going to have to buy a fire engine and build a school and hire a schoolteacher and all that is going to cost a heap . " " Yeah , I expect so . Look , Mr. Williams , you know anything about ' em charging us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams ' blue eyes opened wide and his jaw slackened . " No , I never heard anything like that . Nothing to it . Not a thing . " A squint-eyed , heavy-bodied man named Braden turned from his position in front of Williams . " Yes , there is , " he said . " That was in the paper we signed in Chicago . " " Did you see it ? " Jeremy demanded . " Of course I saw it , " said Braden . " I knew what I was signing . Did n't you ? " " Well , I did n't see anything like that , but I did n't look it over very careful . " " Neither did I , " said Williams . " Well , if you do n't read what you sign you got nobody but yourself to blame if you do n't like it . " " God almighty , " said Floyd Williams . " You mean I got to pay twenty-four dollars and fifty cents railroad ticket for myself and my old woman too ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Forty-nine dollars , " said Sam .  | " But that 's not all , " said Braden . " You got three kids there , Williams , and they charge half fare for them . " " Oh , God , almighty . That 'd be one full fare then for the two boys and then another half fare for the girl . That 'd be twenty-four-fifty more for the two boys and half of that over . " " Twelve and a quarter for the girl , " said Sam , " and thirty-six-seventy-five for the three youngsters . " " How much is that altogether ? " Williams asked , helplessly . " Well , let 's see , " said Sam . " It was forty-nine dollars for you and your wife , so thirty-six and forty-nine  --  that 'd be eighty-five dollars and seventy-five cents . " " You mean I 'm more'n eighty-five dollars in debt here before I even go to work ? " " That 's right , " said Braden , " and plus a week 's wages to the employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of times , ran his tongue around inside his lips , spat fluently and then shook his head . " Well , " he said , " that is something , but I 'll tell you something else . This is the first time anybody ever did give me that much credit , even among folks that knows me , and , well I 'm going to tell you it makes me kind of proud to have a great big company trust me like that and then say for my old woman to go to the store and buy anything she wants on tick . Maybe I had ought to be worried , but , like I say , it makes me kind of proud , and I know it 's going to be better for the youngsters down here than in Chicago too . " " That 's the way to look at it , brother , " said Braden . " If they ai n't worrying I do n't know why you should . Myself , I went into this with my eyes open . Hell , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job and broke , so what in Christ 's kingdom ? " Jeremy reached out with his foot and casually kicked a tall mullein stalk . With iris hands in his pockets , Sam looked at the gray  | sky and whistled a bar of " Go Tell Aunt Rhody . " Then he said , " Well , you do n't ever get anything for nothing in this world . " " You preached a whole sermon there , boy , " said Williams . When Jeremy got inside the office a burly giant by the door directed him by pointing a heavy , knotted cane to a pale , thin man with nose glasses who sat at a table . " That 's Mr. Keller , " he said . Jeremy took off his hat and stepped forward . " Sit down , " said Mr. Keller without changing expression . Jeremy sat down with his hat on his knees . Mr. Keller was something under forty but there were deep vertical wrinkles above his nose , and his pale straight hair was thinning above his pale , high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Age ? " " Well , nearly twenty . " " You mean within a couple of years of twenty ? " " Well , yes , sir . " " What 's your occupation been ? " " Blacksmith . Well , I 'm an apprentice but I 've put in a lot of time at it . " " Never worked in a lumber mill ? " " No , sir , but ? " " Ever sharpen saws ? " " Yes , sir . Sharpened quite a few saws . Of course none of those great big steam saws , but ? " " Can you file and set a crosscut saw ? " " Oh , yes , sir . I 've done that all right . " " Very well . You 'll report to Mr. McDonald in the shop right after dinner and ready for work . Twenty cents an hour for you to start . If you have n't got working clothes and leather gloves get ' em at the commissary . "  | " I 've got clothes but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sign right here . " Jeremy signed . " Well , Mr. Keller , " he said , " where will I find this shop and Mr. McDonald ? " " Small building around to the west of the mill there . Ca n't miss it . Go out the back door , please . Next man , Brooks . " Jeremy turned as he went out the back door and saw Sam approaching Mr. Keller with lips tight and desperate . The clouds were breaking and spots of blue sky were showing . Jeremy sat down on a broad stump , picked up a stick , got out his clasp knife and began whittling as he waited for Sam . He 'd have to get a tablet and some envelopes and a postage stamp or so at the commissary so he could write to Grandpa and Grandma right away . They 'd certainly be surprised to hear of him being way down here . And it looked as if he 'd be here quite a while . Twenty cents an hour would be two dollars a day for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first twelve dollars had to go to the employment agency . And he apparently owed more than two weeks ' pay for his transportation from Chicago . Jeremy cut both ends of the stick off smoothly and began to shave off the bark . Say they charged three dollars a week for board , he would be nine dollars a week in debt at the boardinghouse by the time he had cleaned up with the employment agency and for the railroad fare , so it would take just four weeks ' work before he started saving up anything . Three more weeks ' work would bring in thirty-six dollars , minus nine dollars for board , would be twenty-seven dollars , or more than enough to get back to Chicago . And he had about twenty dollars in his wallet now . Of course he and Sam would have some other expenses , such as the gloves he must buy and the paper and envelopes and postage stamps and probably they would need new overalls and shirts in a month or so . Well , he 'd talk it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working eight weeks and then they  | would n't be clear broke when they got home , but they could still get there well before Thanksgiving . The counterpart of the burly giant in the office came around the building bearing another heavy knotted cane and there was a shiny badge pinned to his left suspender . " Hey , fellow , " he called to Jeremy , " you 're not allowed to loaf around the office . Get on back across the lot where you belong . " " Sorry , " Jeremy said , rising from the stump and brushing the shavings from his knees . " I did n't know about that . " " Well , you know now . " Jeremy shut his knife and sauntered back across the field and went up the steps to the commissary . It was a surprisingly big and busy place . Certainly it was much larger than Shirer 's in Dawn 's Mill . A dozen or more women and several men were making purchases of a wide variety  --  meat , groceries , kerosene , house dresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper-backed novels , tobacco and snuff , lamp chimneys , canned goods , patent medicines , quinine , calomel ; and small Jewish men clerks scurried energetically and noisily around filling orders . Jeremy leaned against a counter , somewhat bewildered by all the activity and next to him was a heavy woman in a flowered calico dress with an order stacked in front of her . " And a pound of coffee , " she said . The black-haired little man on the other side of the counter showed his white teeth in a smile and slowly shook his head . " Sorry , Mrs. Gooding , " he said , " but no more coffee until next week . " The woman frowned . " What you mean by that ? " " Mr. Goldman gave me specific orders . " He shrugged his shoulders , still smiling . " Mr. Goldman says you 're drinking too much coffee for your own good . He says to give you only one pound a week and you got your pound Monday . " " Well , my stars . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't help it . "  | " Joe 'll be madder'n hops . He 's got to have his coffee ever ' meal and you ca n't stretch one little old pound of coffee over a week and you know it  --  not even if I do n't drink any myself at all , and I get a headache if I do n't have my coffee . " " Ca n't help it , Mrs. Gooding . Joe can see Mr. Goldman and if he says it 's all right , I 'm glad to give it to you . That 's all I can say . Now , you sign your slip . Other folks are waiting . " The woman signed the tab , took her sack and went out grumbling . Jeremy bought a pair of heavy leather gloves , which cost him sixty cents , a tablet of writing paper which cost twenty-five cents and a pack of envelopes which cost fifteen cents and a lead pencil for a nickel . He asked if they had any postage stamps . " No , not today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Soap ? Shaving materials ? Toilet articles ? " " Well , yes , come to think of it . " Jeremy bought a bar of yellow soap for a dime and a towel for a quarter . He thought about a razor and decided to discuss that with Sam and to suggest that they go halvers on it . Heretofore , he had borrowed Grandpa Bell 's razor every two weeks or so . In signing his tab he was startled to see that his small purchases had totaled a dollar and forty cents , but comforted himself with the thought that he would n't have to buy any more gloves and that the soap , towel , paper , pencil and envelopes would last him a long time . Leaving the commissary , Jeremy met Sam on the porch . Sam looked glum and Jeremy grinned at him . " Hello , lumberjack , " he said , " what job did you get ? " Sam spat over the porch railing . " I 'm an offbearer , " he said and his black eyes stared antagonistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a duck that takes the boards off the saw carriage  | and stacks ' em on a truck and pushes ' em away to be stacked up . What you going to do ? " " Well , I 'm a saw-filer . I go to work in the shop sharpening crosscut saws for the ducks that cut down the trees . " " Seventeen cents an hour ? " Sam asked . " No , I get twenty . " Sam spat over the railing again . " I get seventeen . And for a ten-hour day , six days a week that makes ten dollars and twenty cents a week . " " Well , of course you 'll get a raise . " " I 've been doing some arithmetic on the way over here , " said Sam evenly . " I 've been doing some figuring . " " So did I , " said Jeremy , " and I figure we 've got to economize . " " Economize , huh ? " " Yeah . I was figuring that we 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Sam 's eyes glittered . He stepped forward and tapped Jeremy on his thick chest . " Look , " he said , " I said I 'd been doing some figuring and listen to what I figure and you wo n't talk about buying razors or anything else . My whiskers can grow down to my belly and to hell with ' cm . I figure that if I do n't spend any money at all , not for gloves like they order or soap or anything , I can be out of debt to this here company in just three years and a half , provided I work ten hours a day every working day . " " Aw , now ! " " And I figure that then if I do n't spend a cent for anything and work ten hours a day every working day I can have enough money saved up to get back to Chicago in another two years and a half after I get out of debt , so maybe I can get back to Dawn 's Mill broke just six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wait a minute , " he said , " just where ? " " All right , " said Sam . " At seventeen cents an hour I 'll  | make ten dollars and twenty cents a week . What 's my board cost ? " " Well , I do n't know exactly , but I figured about three bucks a week . " " Three bucks a week ! " Sam wagged his head sarcastically . " Well , you 're paying and I 'm paying and we 're all paying just exactly ten dollars a week board . " " Oh , no ! Where 'd you get that ? " " I got it , " said Sam , " from that four-eyed bastard who 's some kind of a boss named Keller . I asked him and he said ten dollars a week and I said Jesus Christ , mister , that just only leaves me twenty cents a week and he said , I do n't like your attitude , young man . It costs twice as much to run a boardinghouse like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your having only twenty cents a week gives you an incentive to work hard and improve your position . ' " " Well , " said Jeremy seriously , " that 's bad . " " I 'd remark it 's bad . " " But I 'll tell you , Sam , we 're partners in this and we 'll go halvers on everything . We 'll pool our money and I get twelve dollars a week to start and ? " " Thanks , " said Sam . " That solves everything . We pool our money and if we do n't buy any soap or gloves or overalls we 'll have a dollar and ten cents apiece left over from our board . Maybe the two of us could get away in three or four years . " " You got to get some gloves anyhow , " said Jeremy . " I know it . If you run a splinter into your hand you ca n't work and your board bill goes on just the same . " " I got some soap and a towel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here while you get your gloves . " Jeremy sat down on the porch railing and the roar of the great saw throbbed in his temples . When Sam came out the door he was carrying not only a pair of yellow cowhide gloves but a paper sack and was eating a coconut-covered cookie . " Here , " he said , holding the sack at Jeremy .  | CHAPTER THIRTEEN Dinner at noon in the boardinghouse was roast pork , fried sweet potatoes , corn , cucumber pickles , bread and butter , apple pie and coffee . There was plenty of it and even Sam was heartened by a full belly . Garbed in his overalls and work shirt , Jeremy was at the shop before the one o'clock whistle blew and Ace McDonald , loose-lipped and tobacco-chewing , handed him a worn crosscut saw . Jeremy worked carefully , filing and setting the teeth as Grandpa Bell had taught him , and when he was finished McDonald looked over the blade and sighted down the row of teeth . " It 's all right , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ , but you did all right . Take another from the corner there . " The quitting whistle blew at six o'clock and by the time Jeremy got to the boardinghouse there already was a jam waiting and exchanging obscenities at the wash trough . He went upstairs to get his soap and towel and found Sam sitting humped over the lower bunk . There was sawdust in his hair and eyebrows . There was a rip in the bib of his overalls . " How 'd things go ? " Jeremy asked . " Just wonderful , " Sam drawled . " Hope everything went good with you . " " I did n't have such a bad time . " " You lucky bastard . You would n't . Well , I had the  | roughest five hours in my life . It 's like getting a bear by the tail . You ca n't let go because these boards just keep coming and they do n't give you a chance to catch your breath . " Through the floor came the clatter of pots and pans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men around the wash trough . The young man in the adjoining upper bunk chuckled . " If you do n't like your job why do n't you quit it ? " he asked . Sam peered up at him . " You , " he said , " do n't seem to like the setup here overmuch . Why do n't you quit ? " The young man 's face tightened . Then he sat up , threw the blanket back and hung his long , thin legs over the side of the bunk . He was wearing a checkered shirt open at the neck and nothing else . " Hey , Murph ! " he called out . " What you want ? " an annoyed voice answered from near the door . " Come on back here , will you ? " " Yeah . Just a moment . " " Now look . " The young man leaned forward with his elbows on his knees . " I do n't know your names or anything , but you look like good kids to me . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish somebody had put me on to when I first got here . My name 's Bob Proffitt . " " My name 's Jerry Bell and my partner 's Sam Brock . " " Glad to meet you , " said Proffitt . On the bunk below Proffitt a lantern-jawed , middle-aged man sprawled reading a Bible through steel-rimmed spectacles . He paid no attention to the conversation around him but his thin , tight lips moved slightly , forming the words as he read . A hollow-cheeked , blue-eyed , black-haired man in his mid-thirties sauntered up biting off a chew from a plug of tobacco . " Tommy Murphy , " said Proffitt , " this is Jerry Bell and Sam Brock and they just got in . " Murphy grinned shyly and nodded .  | " I 'm trying to tell ' em somethings for their own good , Murph , and I 'm asking you , Murph , is this camp poison or not ? " Murphy frowned . " You can get in a hell of a lot of trouble talking like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more trouble . And neither are you , Murph . But if somebody had been white enough to tell me about things when I first got here I 'd have got out so fast you could n't see me for the smoke . So would you , Murph , and you know it . " Murphy shook his head . " No , " he said , " I would n't . I got here practically broke . " " Well , I could have . But what I 'm trying to tell you kids is that you ca n't beat this game . The longer you stay the less chance there is to get out . If you 've got enough wampum to pay up your score , you better do it tomorrow and make yourselves scarce . Is that right , Murph , or is n't it ? " " Well  --  sure it 's right , " said Murphy , looking at the floor . " It 's right if they got enough money . " Proffitt grinned and pointed at Sam 's torn overalls . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam looked down . " I do n't know . Board caught on it . " " Yeah . And those things happen all the time around a lumber mill . You know how much a pair of overalls cost you here ? " " These cost fifty cents , " said Sam . " Yeah . Well , they cost a dollar at the commissary . And everything else costs the same way  --  practically twice as much as outside . " " I get what you mean , " said Sam . " They aim to keep you in debt and maybe wo n't sell you a ticket on the WazeeKnight Railroad until you 're out of debt . " Proffitt laughed . " Bright boy . " " But , " said Sam , " anytime you want to leave here if  | you got any gumption at all there 's nothing to stop you from walking away . " " Oh , is n't there ? " inquired Proffitt , swinging his bare legs . Murphy grinned , turned and spat into a cuspidor . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and I do n't think there 's any law in the world that 'll keep you some place because you owe ' em money . If they could hold you here the way you say they do that 'd be downright slavery . " " You 're catching on fast , boy , " said Proffitt . " It 's slavery all right , and especially for the married men . A married man that brings his family down here is stuck proper because if he ever had enough money to pay his family 's fare and to pay for his clearance he 'd never come in the first place , probably , and by the time he sees what he 's up against he 's way too deep in to get out . " " All right , " said Jeremy , " I 'm not doubting your word , but after all there 's the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution that did away with slavery and ? " " Wazee-Knight never heard of it . " " Well , the authorities have . " " Wazee-Knight are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp is listed as a town with Tom Parsons as mayor and they 've got five or six constables that can arrest you any time they want and throw you in jail . " " They got a jail ? " Sam asked . " Of course they 've got a jail . They 've got a log jail here and there 's another jail over in Wamsutter . " Jeremy had got his towel and yellow soap and was standing with them in his hands . " Well , Mr. Proffitt , " he said , " you 've made out that this is a sort of slave camp and all and I 'm not doubting your word , but it still just do n't make sense to me . Why would a company like this want to do business that way ? "  | Murphy spanged the cuspidor again . " Because , " he said , " they 're just naturally bastards . " " But just out of common sense  --  how 're you going to get good work out of men that think they 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head pityingly . " Because , " said Proffitt , " if they catch you loafing or doing something slipshod they just naturally fire you . " Both Jeremy and Sam laughed . " That ai n't funny , " said Murphy . " But , " said Jeremy , " if you want to get away from this place all you need to do is to get fired . " " That 's what you think now , " said Proffitt . " Did you ever hear about going out of the frying pan into the fire ? If you 're fired , what then ? Here you are without a job and you ca n't get away . " " You got legs , have n't you ? " asked Sam . " Know how far it is to Wamsutter ? " Proffitt demanded . " Nope . But I can walk it . So could anybody with any gumption . " Proffitt and Murphy exchanged grins . " You ca n't walk to Wamsutter , lad , " said Murphy . " There 's no way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick your way through the swamps they 're full of cottonmouths and timber rattlers . If you try to tramp in on the railroad they arrest ye for trespassing . " " And , " said Proffitt , " if you get yourself fired and stay around camp a couple of days they arrest you for a vagrant . Either way it 's stripes and the chain gang for you and shotgun guards lashing you with blacksnake whips . " " And , " said Murphy , " the law is you get eleven months and twenty-nine days for vagrancy , but once you 're on the chain gang you 're never free in a year . It 's always easy to trump up one charge or another agin a chain-ganger and give him more and more time until he 's windbroke and  | spavined and sick from the malaria and worthless to himself and everybody else . " " If all this is so , " said Jeremy soberly , " why do n't somebody do something about it ? " " Do what ? " asked Proffitt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proffitt shook his head . " Not down South , " he said . " The state rents these chain-gang workers out by contract . The state makes a profit out of chain gangs by renting them to big companies . That 's why they 're so damn anxious to arrest any stranger for a vagrant and make money out of him . " " By God , " said Sam , " it 's slavery anyhow . Why do n't somebody write a letter to President McKinley and tell him about things ? " Proffitt laughed . " What you think he 'd do ? Send a gunboat maybe ? Well , he would n't even see the letter anyhow . Some clerk would throw it away . " " No , " said Murphy , " I do n't know why I 'm talking so much on account I know it 's smart to keep your lip buttoned around here , but I feel sad ever ' time I see a draft of you innocents coming in , and especially the married folks with children . Once you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smart thing is to keep your mouth shut and do your work and not think about things here but about other things other places . This tract of timber wo n't last forever and when it 's timbered off maybe you 'll have a chance to get back North again . " " Yes , " said Proffitt , dreamily , " we can all live for that happy day when we can get back North where everything is lovely and we 're free to starve or freeze to death or join Coxey 's Army or be shot down by the Pinkertons at another Homestead or by the militia at another Pullman strike . " Murphy was frowning at Proffitt with his eyes narrowed . The supper bell began ringing below and the lantern-  | jawed man put down his Bible , took off his glasses and departed without a word . " Well , " said Murphy , " here I been flapping my lip and now we 'll have to wait for the second table . You feel like scoffing , Bob ? " " Yeah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his overalls from a nail on the upright . " I 'm well now . I 'll be all right now , I expect , for another week . " " Way I figure , " said Murphy , " I get my next chills and fever day after tomorrow . I do n't get ' em often as you do . " Jeremy and Sam went down to the trough to wash and comb their hair . Neither said anything until they were finished at the trough and Jeremy had folded up his towel . Then Sam looked at him with narrowed eyes and said in a hushed voice , " Boy , howdy . " " Yeah , " Jeremy said , " but do n't get in too much of a sweat yet . It 's big sport in some quarters to pull a greeny 's leg . Maybe some of these folks think they 're having fun with some greenhorns . " Sam shook his head . " Do n't look that way to me . " " Not to me either , " Jeremy admitted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting 's all in . " Sam cleared his throat . " We 're elected . You do n't need to worry about that . " There was a great racket of clashing tin dishes and utensils from the first table as they went upstairs to put away the towel and soap . Jeremy stopped at the head of the stairs and took hold of Sam 's arm . " Well , I 'll tell you , " he said , " right after supper we 'll take a walk off a little where we can talk and maybe we can figure something out . " " It 'll take some figuring , " Sam said . Jeremy took out his knife , opened it and began cleaning his fingernails with the point . The tip of his forefinger slid gently down the side of the old blade , caressingly . " Well , " said Sam , " I swear and take an oath right now  | that if I ever get out of this place alive I 'll never bellyache about anything else again as long as I live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , too , until the voting 's all in . " He flipped the blade shut and returned the knife carefully to his pocket . After supper they went out and a group of young men was playing one-old-cat beyond the boardinghouse and yelling like schoolboys . Another small group stood around encouraging two red-faced and sweating youths who seemed to be evenly matched at square wrestling . From over by the family houses came the familiar clang of horseshoes banging against an iron stake . Men and women were working in vegetable and flower gardens . Children were screeching and chasing one another in some game resembling run-sheep-run . A stratum of gray mist was seeping in from the forest and leveling out eight or ten feet above the flat between the mill and the boardinghouse and blue smoke from the smouldering heap of sawdust joined with and tinted the mist . An unidentified songbird was caroling and there was a distant chorus of frogs . Jeremy bit his lip in thought . " Let 's just mosey up that way , " he suggested , nodding his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Sam , " this all reminds me of something but I do n't know what . " " Yeah . But I do n't think it reminds me of any slave camp . These folks are n't so unhappy . They 're having a good time . I do n't know , Sam . " " Did n't the nigger slaves used to play banjos and dance and sing when they were n't working or being flogged by Simon Legrees ? " " Well . . . These are white folks , Sam , and I do n't know . " They were approaching the store and a rugged , baldheaded man on the wooden sidewalk was tamping tobacco  | into a corncob pipe . He struck a match on his thigh , lit the pipe and grinned at Jeremy and Sam . " Nice evening , " he said . " Newcomers , ai n't you ? " " Yeah , " Jeremy said . " Got in this morning . You been here long ? " " Six months . How 'd you like it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 'd you ? " The man grinned again and brushed his thumb over his thick black mustache . " My name 's Joe Frederick  --  timber cutter . " Jeremy introduced Sam and himself and Joe Frederick shook hands with them , holding his cob pipe at a rakish angle between his teeth . " Well , I 'll tell you boys , if you ever find a perfect spot for a workingman on this earth I 'd like to hear about it . And when you find that perfect spot you 'll find there 's soreheads there too . Of course it 's none of my business but I know there 's soreheads here and especially over there in the boardinghouse that make it their business to shoot off the mouth to newcomers and if you check up on those gents you 'll find they 're generally birds that 'd rather work their mouths than their hands . " " I know , " said Jeremy . Sam spat off the sidewalk . " You got to work hard here all right , " said Joe Frederick , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . I got a wife and three children and we 're living good and got nothing to worry about . " " Can you save any money ? " Sam asked . Joe Frederick took the pipe from his mouth and grinned widely . " Pardner , " he said , " you know any place where a workingman with a wife and three children can save any money ? We got a good comfortable place to live and good wholesome food and all the clothes we need and this fall they 're getting in a schoolteacher so the young sprouts can get their educa-  | tion . I know one thing , that I 'm better off than I ever was in St. Louis and nothing to worry about as long as I do my job . " He put his pipe back into his mouth and smashed a mosquito on the back of his left hand . Picking up the carcass between thumb and forefinger he laughed . " One thing they 've got down here is the most bodacious skeeters I know about . Look at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works ? He just lands easy on all legs like a cat and then puts his head down and starts boring . These suckers come in head down and they got their beak in you before their legs ever land . " " Well , " said Jeremy , " suppose you get tired of this place or your wife does n't like it or something ? Can you leave when you want to ? " Joe Frederick 's mouth drew down beneath his mustache . " I 'll tell you honest , " he said , " this here 's no place for tramps or shiftless folks , but for a decent steady man that wants to support his family it ai n't bad at all . The way I look at things , it 's going to take another five year to timber off this section and the man that treats Wazee-Knight decent is going to have a good steady job for five years anyhow . And if he 's a good man they 'll probably be glad to move him to another tract . " " What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it after those five years ? " Joe Frederick looked at Sam suspiciously . " I reckon , " he said , " you been listening to some of the troublemakers in the boardinghouse already . " " Sure , " said Jeremy , " we heard some talk and we wanted to hear the other side of things . " " Truth of it is , " said Frederick , clipping off his words , " most of the men that do n't get along here are just soreheads because Wazee-Knight wo n't stand for drinking-liquor and I 'll tell you boys that a sawmill ai n't any place for booze . Take a man with a skinful or a hangover and he 'll  | not only get himself killed or hurt but he 's dangerous for other folks too . " He pointed his corncob at Sam . " You ask me what I 'll have to show for five years . Well , boy , I ask you what any decent family workingman has got to show for five years ' work ? And I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clothed and with five years of learning and that much further along towards being decent , law-abiding , Godfearing citizens . Take me , and in five years my oldest boy will be fifteen years old and big enough to go to work himself and practically raised as far as my old woman and me are concerned . My girl will be thirteen years old and ready to get married herself in maybe another three or four years . And they 'll be healthy and strong from living in the woods instead of in St. Louis and without being up against the sin and temptations of a big city . That 's what I 'll have in five years . " " That 's something , " said Jeremy . " Something ! I 'll remark it 's something when you think about the average workingman worrying about how long he can keep his job and if he loses it what 's going to become of his children . And give me five years here and I 'll even have some tin saved up . " He winked an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got one raise in pay already and right now I 'm breaking even at the store . Give me another raise and I 'll start paying ' em back for when I was running in the hole . " " Suppose , " said Jeremy , " that you get hurt ? " " It 's a man 's own lookout to use common horse sense and not get hurt . If you 'll just notice , good Christians that do n't drink booze and use good common horse sense do n't get hurt much . " " Suppose you get sick ? " " A man that lives out doors a lot and thinks the proper  | thoughts and keeps his bowels open and says his prayers do n't get sick . " " I do n't know , " said Sam . " Seems like there 's considerable fever and ague around here . " " Fever and ague ! " Frederick laughed around his pipe stem . " That do n't amount to anything . My old woman has fever and ague and 'll feel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to really go to bed with it . Course there 's some people that 's always looking for an excuse to coddle themselves and lay abed and if they did n't have fever and ague they 'd find something else for an excuse . All you got to do is take quinine and calomel or if you want you can get a bottle medicine for it at the commissary . " Jeremy said , " Well , I take it then , Mr. Frederick , that you 're pretty well satisfied here and would n't move your family out even if you had a chance . " " I should say I would n't . Boy , I 've had experience walking the streets looking for a job , any kind of a job , and maybe working hard all day for four bits and maybe getting nothing . When you 've had experience hearing your babies cry themselves to sleep on account they 're hungry , you appreciate it when you get a steady job with nothing to worry about and working for people that treat you decent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Jeremy . " Point ? I just got enough sense to know when I 'm well off . That 's all . I tell you , boys , I just do n't know what 's wrong with some of these soreheads and I reckon they 're anarchists or Socialists . The thing to remember about a big company like Wazee-Knight is that if you treat them right they 'll treat you right . Without they 're honest and decent they just do n't get to be such big companies and any men like this Debs or Thomas Mitchell that think they can get laboring men together in a union and then tell their bosses how to run their businesses are just plain crazy on top of being outlaws and bound to land in jail like Debs . "  | " Well , mister , " said Sam , " I do n't know very much about all those things but ? " " just suppose you was a boss , " said Frederick , " and you hired a man to do a job and then the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't do and how many hours a day he 'd work and how much you had to pay him . You 'd tell him where he could go , would n't you ? You bet you would , and so fast it 'd make his head swim . When the world gets to such a pretty state that workingmen can boss the bosses why nobody at all will work and we 'll all live like savages in a jungle . " " Well , I do n't know , " said Sam , " but ? " " Well , Mr. Frederick , " said Jeremy , " thank you ever so much for telling us about things and we 'll be seeing you around , I expect . " " Oh , you 're welcome and glad to do it . Just you boys do n't listen to any of them soreheads at the boardinghouse , but come up to the house any evening and meet the family . I live up there in House Sixteen . Well , I got to be going now . The old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down and get her some more quinine . " With their hands in their pockets , Jeremy and Sam sauntered past the commissary , off the wooden sidewalk and up a slight rise to a big sour gum tree . Sam whistled " After the Ball " under his breath and looked up into the tree . Jeremy picked up a stick , took out his knife and sat down . " Well , partner , " Jeremy said finally , " as far as I 'm concerned now , all the votes are in . " Sam sat beside him still hissing " After the Ball " between his teeth . " Yep , " he said , " the votes are all in and we 're going to have plenty of time to count ' em . What the man say  --  five years ? " " Maybe I 've got an idea , " said Jeremy . " Five years , " said Sam . " Everybody in Dawn 's Mill will have forgot Bell and Brock . Probably both Judy and Julie will be married to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | mill any more . After five years not much use even going home any more . " Sam returning to hissing " After the Ball . " " Look , " said Jeremy , " how much money you got ? " " Not near enough and you know it . " " You can count , ca n't you ? " Jeremy was unbuttoning his overall bib pocket and pulling out his own big snap purse . " I got about twenty dollars , " said Sam . " Well , count it . " Sam grunted but brought forth his own pocketbook , drew out the small , tightly folded wad of bills and spilled the silver and copper coins into his palm . He counted it carefully and then looked at Jeremy , his dark face expressionless . " I got exactly twenty dollars and thirty-four cents , " he said , " and I owe twenty-four-fifty for railroad fare alone . " " Yeah , " said Jeremy . " Well , I got nineteeen dollars and seventy-five cents . How much does that make for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine cents , but ? " " Well , Sam , " said Jeremy , grimly , " I think we 're really in honest-to-God trouble . " " Bell finally wakes up , " said Sam . " Yeah , I know . It 's my fault and I got us into a mess and now I 'm going to try and get us out . " " Was n't all your fault . Hell , I 'm not a baby . It was as much my fault as yours . " " No , it was my fault , but that do n't matter right now . The main thing is what we 're going to do about it . Here 's my idea , Sam . Before I left home Grandpa knew all along that there was a good chance we 'd get into a mess but I was too smart and did n't think so . And Grandpa said very emphatic that if I got in trouble all I needed to do was telegraph him and he would telegraph me money or would even come by train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegraph here , is there ? " " Do n't think so , but even if there was I do n't think  | I 'd trust it . Here 's my idea , Sam . We lump our money and that 's enough for you to go to the office tomorrow and tell ' em you 're quitting and settle up what you owe in cash and get your clearance and ? " Sam shook his head . " Oh , no , " he said . " You 're bugs . I would n't do that . " " Will you hold your horses a minute ? Let me say what I 've got to say . Then you get a ticket to that town  --  whatyou-call-it . " " They called it Wamsutter . " " Whatever it is that 's eighteen miles and they would n't charge more than a dollar for that . " " They can charge any damn thing they please in this place , " said Sam . " Well , I certainly do n't think they 'd have gall enough to charge more'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty gall . " " How much do you owe the store ? " Sam squinted and stuck out his chin . " Paid sixty cents for a two-bit pair of gloves and two bits for a dime 's worth of cookies . Way I figure it , I owe ' em eighty-five cents . " " All right , eighty-five cents added to the thiry-fourseventy you owe ' em for railroad fare and for the employment agency is how much ? " " Thirty-five-fifty-five . " " So , figure a dollar to get to this Wamsutter place and that makes it thirty-six-fifty-five . So we 've got forty dollars and nine cents and you take thirty-six-fifty-five from fortyoh-nine and it leaves how much ? " " Wait a minute , " said Sam . " Let 's see , that would leave three-fifty  --  well , three-fifty-four . " " All right , " said Jeremy , " now you just about break even with the boardinghouse , so you can settle up and get up to that town with three-fifty in your pocket . " " Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your money ? "  | " Let me finish , will you ? When you get to that town you go into the depot and send a telegram to Grandpa Bell or your father and you got to say it in as few words as possible , but maybe send it to your father and tell him to see Grandpa and that we 're in trouble and got to have a hundred dollars and for them to telegraph it to you . " Sam shook his head . " A hundred dollars is a hell of a lot of money , " he said . " I know it . But we got to have it , or nearly that . We 'll pay it back . If your pa has n't got it handy , Grandpa 's got it and he 'll send it . " " I expect , " said Sam , " that each of ' em could send half . " " Yeah . Well , then you find a boardinghouse to stay in where you can wait for the telegram and your telegram had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have about two-fifty to live on . It might take even two days on account they 'll probably have to get a rig and drive to Appian City to telegraph the money . " " How can they telegraph money ? " " I do n't know , but they do . Grandpa said he would telegraph me money if I needed it and I think maybe we need it pretty bad right now . " " Well , " said Sam , " I think maybe you 're talking good sense now , but why should I go instead of you ? It 's your idea . Why do n't you go and then when you get the telegraphed money you can come back here and buy me out . " " No , " said Jeremy , " my job ai n't so bad and I make more money at it . To tell the truth , I do n't mind my job filing saws at all and I do n't think it 'd be so bad staying here a while . " " Well , what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit , " said Jeremy , slowly , " is the idea of somebody tying me up when I do n't know it . What I do n't like is somebody telling me I ca n't leave if I want to . Here . "  | Jeremy handed his currency and coins to Sam . " I expect , " he said , " you 'd better telegraph your father and say something like Tell Mr. Bell we 're in trouble please telegraph hundred dollars to get home on . ' " Jeremy closed his knife , put it in his pocket and stood up . Sam crammed the money into his purse and buttoned it into his overalls pocket . The gray mist now had spread across the roof tops of the family houses and twilight hid the ranks of forest trees beyond the mill . Jeremy and Sam walked back slowly toward the boardinghouse with their hands in their pockets . Under his breath Sam whistled " After the Ball . " CHAPTER FOURTEEN Despite weariness resulting from three previous nights of sketchy sleep , Jeremy lay awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mumblings and snores and throatclearings around him , Jeremy could recognize the heavy breathing of Sam Brock in the bunk below . He was glad that Sam could fall asleep so easily . He was glad that Sam apparently was not seriously oppressed by the accumulation of disappointments , humiliations and defeats which burned acid-sour in himself . Sam could well sleep with untroubled thoughts . It was Jeremy and not Sam who must be branded as a simon-pure gump . Sam had opposed this adventure . He had wanted to go home from Chicago , but Jeremy , feeling rashly bold , had taken command and literally forced Sam into slavery .  | Well , at least they were lucky enough to have the means of escape . Soon now they both would be free of the multiplying tentacles of the Wazee-Knight cuttlefish and within a few days they would be back home able to laugh grimly at their near-tragic blunder . The whole story would seem very funny indeed to Dawn 's Mill and it was inevitable that the story would get out . Jeremy could hear Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coleman and Skinny Robinson and old Nate Frippy and Pinky Walker and the rest of the village wits . The wisdom of these stay-at-homes was always beyond question ; none of them would have been foolish enough to make such a mistake as Sam and he had made . Yes , the misadventure would become something of a legend in Dawn 's Mill  --  a tale to be passed on and on , growing with each repetition . Loafers at the barbershop and in front of the store would call out , " Hi , Jerry  --  how 'd you like the sawmill ? " That well could become a byword ? " How 'd you like the sawmill , Jerry ? " If he did n't carry it off right , if he showed the slightest annoyance ; the village wits would pounce upon him like wolves and then even small boys might take to shrieking after him , " How 'd you like the sawmill , Jerry ? " Jeremy knew the formula well . He had seen Chet Smith , one of Shirer 's clerks , driven from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoherence over the bite of a wounded squirrel . There was nothing very funny about being bitten by a squirrel , but Chet Smith 's astonishment and indignation had been more pronounced , by just a shade , than was acceptable by barbershop conventions . Bill Lowney had exhibited grave sympathy and had encouraged Chet Smith to remove the rag from his finger and display the wound to Bill and old Nate Frippy . Then  | Pinky Walker came into the shop and Chet was cajoled into taking off the bandage again . From then on Chet Smith was a lost soul . Groups of two or three or four would crowd up to Chet 's counter in Shirer 's , coaxing , wheedling between chuckles , " Let 's see where the squirrel bit you , Chet . Aw , come on , Chet , take off the rag . Let 's see where the squirrel bit you . " On Main Street in front of Doc Ackerman 's drugstore , Chet took a swing at Skinny Robinson , but the others seized him and laughed him out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hi , Chet  --  did the squirrel bite you ? " For the first few times Chet would take a few steps after the boys , cursing , and this so delighted his tormentors that he realized he must ignore them or be destroyed . Finally , to insure against the delicious incident 's ever being forgotten , it was perpetuated in the nickname Squirrel Smith . Yes , Jeremy realized how well he must keep his poise under the inevitable joshing of Dawn 's Mill , how he must keep nicely to the narrow path between dignity and laconic good humor so that " Hi , Jerry  --  how 'd you like the sawmill ? " would die from lack of fuel . Well , damn it , he really did n't mind the sawmill so much . Despite everything , he did n't . If it were n't for Sam , he 'd just as soon work here a few months and then quietly write to Grandpa for money to get away with . He thought of Grandpa and Grandma and the familiar friendliness of the blacksmith shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean , brown-eyed Julie  --  and the quiet , unworried security of home , and it was all remote and desirably beautiful . It seemed that he had been away weeks and even months . Yet this was only Thursday night and they had left home Sunday morning . Jeremy sighed . He was sorry and even resentful about
