One revolutionary aspect of the news TIME has to cover is the way in which Central Americans have long been used to changing their governments . During the last year , the job of reporting this news has fallen mainly to John Stanton , chief of TIME Inc. ' s Mexico City bureau . Learning that he had just returned from an extensive trip through Central America , I asked him to amplify his experiences with the postwar revolutionists . This is his reply : <P> " Since last January I have rushed southward three times into Central America in answer to five-alarm calls . I have stood stock still in Managua 's central plaza howling Periodista ! Periodista ! ( Journalist ! Journalist ! ) at a platoon of General Somoza 's guardia who were charging across with bayonets fixed . I have smudged my nose on San Jose 's cold pavements when police fired in the general direction of a mob of which I , unhappily , was one . All in vain . Somehow or other the revolutions do n't seem to carry through down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met feel a little sad about the lack of sizzle in their current revolutions . I found a doctor in Costa Rica , a newspaperman in Nicaragua and a customs official in Honduras this last trip who were all writing nostalgic biographies of William Walker , the Southern gentleman who used to make himself President of Nicaragua periodically and war upon everybody in sight . All three asked whether I knew of a good , reliable literary agent in New York . <P> " Here in Mexico City , occupying 45 chairs in as many different cafes on any given day , are the 45 generals who used to command Ubico 's army in Guatemala . They have an odd habit of snorting through their noses as they tell you what they will do to the current Guatemalan Government once they get arms . <P> " Some of the old boys are still in office . Over in Honduras ' capital , Tegucigalpa , sits General Carias , whose jails are still full of political prisoners . He glares at you out of a heavy , wooden face and asks : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why do you do it ? ' Up on the hill in Managua is General Somoza , who kicks presidents in &; out of office , at will . He greets you with a big smile and an abrazo and asks : ' Stanton , what can I do for you ? ' You talk about the political situation and he laughs at you and says : ' You know I have been good to my foes . ' His eyes are dancing . You go away with an invitation to have dinner with him in Philadelphia as soon as his enemies manage to kick him out of the country . <P> " Things are changing in Central America . The millions of little fellows who for centuries had to be content with thatched huts , mud floors , beans , tortillas and abject poverty have been stirred by Mexico 's example and are beginning to ask for more . You find such old line Central American generals as General Castenada talking worriedly of the need for social security laws and labor codes .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
