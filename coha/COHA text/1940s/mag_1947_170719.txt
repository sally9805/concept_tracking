Igor Gouzenko , the Russian who ripped the veil from Soviet espionage in Canada , made last week what might be his final public appearance under his own name . The occasion was the trial in Montreal of Dr. Raymond Boyer , onetime Government explosives expert who is charged with conspiring to give secret information to Russia . While seven Mounties guarded the courtroom , Gouzenko testified briefly that Boyer 's name had been on the list of Canadians who were helping the Russians . Then , his job done , he turned in the witness box , bowed to the Bench , walked to a door at the rear of the court and stepped out of the limelight to live in hiding under a different name . Only if the police caught two spy suspects who are still at large , needed him for testifying , would Igor Gouzenko make a brief appearance again . <P> Convict the Guilty . Eighteen months have elapsed since the young ( 28 ) cipher clerk , fed up with Communism , stuffed 100-odd secret documents inside his shirt and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him 36 frantic hours to_the persuade anyone to listen to his shocking story-that a handful of traitorous Canadians had sent to Moscow information of the greatest importance about radar as well as samples of precious uranium 235 from which the atom bomb is made . <P> Since then Igor Gouzenko has been the most closely guarded man in Canada . His testimony has resulted in ten convictions ( Boyer 's trial is the last of those arrested ) . <P> As the Dominion Government 's guest , he has been living with his wife Svetliana , his son Andrei and his baby daughter , in different places in eastern Canada . Always moving , he has been guarded 24 hours a day by from one to eight R.C.M.P. constables . When his daughter was born , his wife entered an Ottawa hospital under an assumed name and a Mountie posed as the father . Mounties shopped for his baby 's clothes . <P> The number of Canadians who have seen Gouzenko face to face is comparatively small . At the Government 's request , no paper has printed his picture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is a stocky blond . Between trials he has busied himself with landscape painting and writing . <P> Earn a Reward . What the Government planned to do to keep him and his family in safety from now on , it was not saying . Presumably the Gouzenkos will be granted Canadian citizenship and then quietly settle down where no enemies will be likely to find them . <P> Financially , Gouzenko is fairly well fixed . Cosmopolitan magazine paid him a reported $50,000 for his story of the spy ring . In addition , he is assured of a small but steady income . A fortnight ago a Canadian industrialist walked into the Justice Building at Ottawa with a plan for Gouzenko . He explained that he knew " seven or eight other men " who would be willing to contribute a fund to buy a Dominion Government annuity for Gouzenko . Told that $24,000 would buy an annuity paying him $100 a month for life , the businessman said : " Never mind the other fellows , I 'll do the whole thing myself . Let 's let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful enough to Gouzenko not to let him starve . "
