A real-estate transaction in Manhattan was as significant in its way as anything said in all of last week 's speeches in Washington . <P> On Fifth Avenue , with a fine view of Central Park across the street , sits a 66-room red brick Georgian mansion , one of the largest and most lavish houses in New York City . Across the street , the late Banker Otto Kahn 's Florentine stone palace is now the Sacred Heart Convent for girls ; a block up Fifth Avenue stands Banker Felix Warburg 's six-story home : it is now the Jewish Museum . Farther down Fifth Avenue , workmen this week started tearing down Financier Thomas Fortune Ryan 's ornate 30-room mansion . <P> Steelmaster Andrew Carnegie built the Georgian mansion in 1900 for $1,000,000 , and later put up a 29-room house next door for his daughter . In the old days it took 25 to 30 servants to staff the mansion . They worked in a big kitchen that was white-tiled to the ceiling , waited on Steelmaker Carnegie and his guests in the walnut-paneled library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basement there is still a mining car , with its own track and turntable , to take coal from the bunker to the stoking floor . On cold days , it took a ton and a half of coal to heat the place . <P> Carnegie used to order Dewar 's Scotch whiskey in 50 or 60-gallon casks . Reporters , touring the wine cellar , found pigeonholes marked Sparkling Moselle , Champagne , and Marsala , now empty . The wine bottles , like the era , were long since gone . Looking back , that past day now seemed like an era of happy irresponsibility , when no man had to account for his riches-though , like Carnegie , some of the wealthy , e.g. , Andrew Mellon , John D. Rockefeller and Julius Rosenwald , had indeed accounted for theirs in handsome gifts to charity , art and education . Ever since the Widow Carnegie died in 1946 ( Carnegie himself died in 1919 ) , only a caretaking staff of six had lived in the big place . <P> Last week , when the Carnegie Corp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansion and the 29-room house next door , it wasted no time looking for a Croesus who could afford to keep them open . After all , the places were assessed for $2,100,000 , and taxes were $62,000 a year . Instead , the corporation turned over both mansions , on a 21-year rent-free lease , to the New York School of Social Work of Columbia University . The big kitchen would be turned into a cafeteria , and the art gallery into a lecture hall . <P> Nobody seemed to mind , or even to see anything very unusual about this news . That attitude , too , told a lot about the richest nation in the world , the way it was heading , and the way a majority of its citizens had shown-in five presidential elections-that they wanted it to go .
