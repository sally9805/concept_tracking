" That was a bomb . The sky is absolutely patterned with bursts of antiaircraft fire and the sea is covered with smoke . Parachuters ? No , I think they 're sea gulls . Oh , we 've just hit a Messerschmitt ! Oh , that was beautiful ! He 's coming right down . You hear those crowds ? " <P> Rattling along in this fashion last week , BBC 's Newscaster Charles ( " Filthy " ) Gardner brought to British listeners radio 's first eyewitness blow-by-blow account of a full-dress air battle . Nervous , wiry , a pilot himself , Gardner patrolled the English Coast with a recording van for a solid week before he happened upon an air fight off the chalk cliffs of Dover . For nine frantic minutes , Gardner talked into his recording machine , then whirled off to London to persuade the Ministry of Information to issue a bulletin on the raid an hour earlier than usual . Dramatic enough to galvanize even the most stolid Britisher , the Gardner broadcast wound up in fine sporting style with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently set another precedent by aiming at the U. S. a program exclusively designed for American listeners . Known as Britain Speaks , the new show , now a fortnight old , is a vast improvement over the stodgy stuff that BBC used to short wave to North America to be shared by Canada and the U. S. With swing bands and torch singers , brisk news and political comments , Britain Speaks ( on every evening at 7:30 E.D.S.T. ) is at its best when Novelist-Playwright John Boynton Priestley holds forth . Compact as a beer mug , with a voice as mellow as ancient ale , Priestley has a pronounced Yorkshire accent which falls more pleasantly on American ears than the nasal whinnys of Oxford . <P> Sincere , hearty , full of gallant buck-you-uppo , most of Priestley 's remarks have been right down the U. S. alley . On food : " You can eat yourself sick if you want to , but of course it is very nice to have a parcel of America 's noblest produce including perhaps a bottle of rye or bourbon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shepherd and clerk , turning out at night as our forefathers had often done before us , to keep watch and ward over the sleeping hills and fields and homesteads . " On war : " A lot of us may be maimed or dead very soon , but that ca n't be helped . We 'll go on and on until we break their black hearts . "
