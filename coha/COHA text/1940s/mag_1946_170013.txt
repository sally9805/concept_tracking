" Remember , " said Horatio Nelson , as he lay dying on the quarter-deck of the Victory , " I leave Lady Hamilton as a legacy to my King and country that they will give her an ample provision to maintain her rank . " <P> The grateful nation , which thought Emma Hamilton 's rank little better than a whore 's , took him at his word . To a respectable brother , the Rev. William Nelson , went an earldom , a 3,000-acre estate , Trafalgar , in Wiltshire and a pension of 5,000 yearly to be paid to his heirs forever . To Emma went nothing ; she died ten years later , a raddled and penniless old woman , in France . <P> Last week Emma had her revenge . After 140 years and 700,000 of payments , His Majesty 's Government announced a plan to terminate its last " perpetual " pension . The amiable , doddering , 88-year-old fourth Earl or his 85-year-old brother Edward will continue to collect while they live . To keep the next heir , Edward 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to remove the family entail from Trafalgar House . When and if it is sold , future heirs will retain only an empty earldom , a coat of arms , and the bitter comfort of the Nelson family motto : " Let him wear the palm who has deserved it .
