Last August the National Inventors Council , a board of crackerjack inventors , scientists and industrialists , set out under the auspices of the Federal Government to encourage the U.S. public to submit new ideas for defense weapons . Since that time the board has scrutinized 29,300 inventions submitted to it . Some of them , accepted by the Army and Navy , have passed into the realm of military secrets . Others have remained just what they were : crackpot contraptions . Some of those which are not secret : <P> &gt; A bomb filled with skunk musk which , dropped on an enemy ship , would so nauseate the crew that the vessel could be boarded , towed to port , fumigated , and added to the U.S. Navy . <P> &gt; A shell filled with sneezing powder which would explode in the face of the enemy and incapacitate him . <P> &gt; A nozzle for the last coach of every railroad train to squirt black paint on the rails and make them invisible to enemy bombers . <P> &gt; A propeller , motor and wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene of combat . <P> &gt; A tank fitted with an auger for drilling itself into the ground to lie in wait or hide from the enemy . <P> &gt; A submarine chaser composed of separately powered units linked together , which could wriggle through the water , coil itself around a U-boat , crush it . <P> &gt; A harness permitting trained seals to tow torpedoes to their destination . ( Seal would flip clear just before contact . ) <P> &gt; Plans for a death-ray gun by a St. Louis inventor who landed in the hospital after the gun 's first testing .
