txt As the Senate Agriculture Committee opened its food inquiry today , representatives of packers accused the Office of Price Administration of having largely caused the meat shortage by following " a social philosophy which regards profit as a sin . " Wilbur La Roe Jr . of Washington , general counsel for the 700-member National Independent Meat Packers Association , coupled that accusation with another that the OPA was " flouting the declared will of Congress " in its price policies . He charged that for two years the OPA had operated " a price squeeze " against the packers under which both beef and pork were now being processed at a loss . J. F. Brownlee , deputy administrator of the OPA in charge of prices , took " violent exception " to all this and arranged to prthsent his reply , probably tomorrow . For three hours Mr. La Roe was before the ccmmittee as it began its long task in which , Chairman Elmer Thomas said , it would use the facilities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other Government agencies " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " Food Position of Allies Queried The wide range was indicated by the dozens of witnesses on hand and on call and by the statements of committee members that they wanted to go beyond the production , price and processing issues into the relationship of the American food position to that of the Allies . Senators Wheeler of Montana and Ellender of Louisiana , Democrats , indicated at the outset that they would insist upon an inspection of the lend-lease situation . " I understand that all kinds of meat are available in Canada and looking for a market , " Senator Wheeler asserted . " It is important to find out what lend-lease and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are doing with meat . Why are the British not using Canadian meat instead of American meat ? " " Because they would have to pay for it from Canada , " interjected Senator Shipstead , Republican , of Minnesota . Meantime the House debated , but did not finally act upon a resolution by Representative Anderson , Democrat , of New Mexico , for an investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Commends World Body In a related field , President Roosevelt sent to Congress a special message asking for legislation permitting the participation of this country in the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , which was set up at Hot Springs , Va. , in 1943 . " In becoming a member of the Food and Agriculture Organization we will retain complete freedom of action in determining our national agricultural policies , " he wrote . " Under its constitution , the organization will have no powers of direction or control over any nation . It will recommend agricultural policies and advise nations on their food and agricultural problems , but it will have no power to coerce or command . " Mr. La Roe 's testimony before the Senate committee was sup // ported in general by other spokesmen for packers . The sum of his principal contention was that the OPA had " economic and social ideas " wholly opposed to the profit motive and that it was being administered in violation of the amendment to the Price Control Act , which specified " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , read this to mean that if a packing concern made an overall profit it was not entitled to a profit , or even to regulations allowing sale at cost , on any single kind of meat . The effect of this , he asserted , was to foster monopoly and to channel available meat supplies first into black market operations and , somewhat secondarily , to the major packing companies , which , he added , in their many subsidiary operations were more nearly able to show overall profits than were the small and medium concerns . In reply to questions as to what should be done , Mr. La Roe first said that he would recommend new legislation only " as a last resort , " suggesting instead that the committee try to use its " influence " on Chester Bowles , the OPA Administrator , to bring about a different price interpretation . Finally , after indirectly expressing the view that Mr. Bowles might prove adamant , he suggested that the Price Control Act be amended specifically to declare that " a fair and equitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various meats , beef , lamb and pork . Senator Wheeler observed that If Mr. La Roe was putting the matter correctly , " you do n't need a new law ; you need a new Price Administrator . " Another witness , John A. Lyons , representing the Atlantic Meat Company of Newark , N. J. , and its parent corporation , Batchelder &; Snyder Company , Inc. , of Boston , remarked : " The trouble comes mostly from the fellows down below , because it is their philosophy that is being followed . " Analysis by Ex-WFA Man Wells E. Hunt , a former consultant of the War Food Administration , now employed by the eightynine-year-old Baltimore packing concern of William SchluderbergT . J. Kurdle , gave these as the " basic causes " for all the present difficulty about meat : " The OPA price policy and its persistent adherence to the overall profit theory . " The failure of Government agencies actually to control slaughter . which is indispensable to price control . " The Administration 's policy of dividing authority and responsibility , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the OPA was engaged in " margin squeezing in the guise of inflation control " and that many packers " must either go black or go broke . " Aside from his attack on price policies , Mr. La Roe said that the position was particularly " tragic " just now because hog production was " down 30 per cent , " and this he attributed to poor prices paid to hog raisers last year . The beef situation , he said , was " anomalous because we have on the range the largest cattle population in the history of the United States-80,000,000 head . " He submitted telegrams from various packers reporting that the price situation was preventing them from processing thousands of cattle weekly because they could not buy and sell at OPA price levels without loss . Where about 1,500 packers were operating before the war , he said , now " a host of more than 20,000 new slaughterers " were operating , without Federal policing , under recently issued permits from the WFA.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
