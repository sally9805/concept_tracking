" We 'll defeat the Japanese in the end , " said Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson , " but we should n't look at the war with them through rose-colored glasses . " <P> Secretary Stimson has had a record of Tightness about the Japanese stretching back to 1931 , when , as Secretary of State , he condemned the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in terms far stronger than the rest of the diplomatic world was prepared then to accept . As Secretary of War he has personally been guilty of no cocky bombast , has indulged no huggermugger secrecy , has , instead , been frank , grave , honest . And so his words last week deserved a hearing . <P> He gave the warning because he respects the Japanese man as a fighting mechanism and wants the U.S. public not to underrate that mechanism . " There have been reports , " he said , " that the Japanese in the Philippines are badly trained troops , ill-equipped . I regret to say that these are erroneous . The cold truth is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese soldier is short , wiry and tough . He is well-disciplined . <P> The Japanese staff officers ' work has been of a high order . " Outside . In battle dress a Japanese soldier looks like a badly wrapped brown paper package . His legs are too short , his pants are baggy , his leggings droop , his tunic is loose , his kit askew . He wears muddy leather shoes . He may have on a sweater or messy fatigue clothes . <P> But the sloppiness is misleading . For his size , this man-weapon carries an extraordinary amount of equipment . His .25-caliber rifle or machine gun is light and accurate to 1,000 yards . He can carry 400 rounds of its little bullets , twice as many as the load of larger bullets the larger U.S. trooper totes . He carries a bayonet , a canteen , a helmet with a little gold star on it . He carries five days ' rations of rice and sardines , and he tends his own cooking . <P> Physically he is as tough as he is un @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of his splay-toed feet he is hard . His buttocks are big with marching . His arms are strong , and he can dig himself into a shallow trench quickly and neatly . His eyes are generally good , and there is no physical reason why his aim should not be clean . <P> He walks like a duck , runs like a man cut off at the knees . " They did n't charge , " said one U.S. officer , describing a Japanese advance , " but crouched forward just a little bit , lifting their knees high in a sort of imitation goosestep . They kept coming forward in pairs , one directly behind the other . "
