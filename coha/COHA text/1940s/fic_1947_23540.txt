BENNY AND THE TAR-BABY A STORY BY JOHN WATSON Illustrated by Aurelius Battaglia UT IF you shoot the Princess , " I told B Uncle Mark , " then the Tar-Baby will surely die . He will starve to death , because he ai n't old enough yet to ketch on to how to eat grass and corn and stuff like his ma can . Seems like he ai n't got the hang of it yet . " I explained it to Uncle Mark , but it did n't make no difference . He had his head set on shootin her . " That-air mare is a dangerous animal , " he said . " She might up and kill somebody else . The colt will have to git along the best way he can . " " Maybe she did n't aim to do it , " I told him . " Maybe it was an accident ; she stepped in a gopher hole and stumbled , and he fell off and hit his head on the rock . " But he never give in . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook-stove with his legs crossed and peeled them slithers of red cedar off of the little piece of stick with his pocketknife and let them fall on the floor around his feet . " Besides , " he said , " a eight-year-old young'un ai n't got no call to be buttin into grown folks 's business . You better go ' long and shuck off to bed . " That was the next night after Papa got on Princess along about sundown and rode out in the pasture to look for Queen Mary because she never come up with the rest of the cows at milkin time and he knowed she was prolly out there on the gully some'eres with a fresh-born calf , waitin for it to get strong enough to walk up tothe house with her . And Tar-Baby went along with them because he always follows his ma wherever she goes , like a feist dog that might follow you to town of a Saturday mornin . He 'll fool around sniffin at a mesquite bush or smellin in the grass , makin out like he do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then here he 'll come in a high lope , prancin and kickin up his heels and sail on past you and keep pin for maybe a hundred yards until he sees another bush or weed or something and he 'll play like he 's awfully interested in it and let you come on by and get ahead again . Anyhow , they went on out in the pasture , Papa ridin bareback on the Princess and her carryin her head high and steppin like the ground might be covered with eggs , kinda watchin Tar-Baby out of the corner of her eyes , proud-like , because she knowed full well it was n't air ' nother colt in the whole state of Texas as pretty as he was , much less as smart . They was n't gone more'n a half a hour or such a matter till Princess come back to the house with the bridle reins draggin and Tar-Baby cavortin around and runnin back and forth through them reins like he was playin some kind of a game . So Mama knowed it was something wrong and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biscuits so they would n't burn while she footed it on out there in the pasture to see what was the matter . Then pretty soon she come tearin back to the house wringin her hands with a wild look out of her eyes , and I kno wed they was something wrong too . But it was n't Tar-Baby , because he was out there at the barn gittin his supper . Mama come runnin across the back yard screamin like it might of been a pack of wolves sniffin at her coat-tail . " Benny , " she said , " run git Mr. Roberts as quick as you can . Your pa has fell and hurt hisself . " So I did n't wait to ask no questions . I just run out to the lot and jumped on Princess because she still had the bridle on , and me and her went flyin down the big road to Mr. Roberts 's place . But we did n't go too fast , because we did n't neither one of us want to run off and leave Tar-Baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his ma can when she really lets herself out . Old Mr. Roberts never lost no time neither . He jumped on that chestnut horse of his'n that he works to the buggy and here we come lammin it back down that red clay road makin sounds like you hear in the movies of a Saturday night when the sheriff is chasin a cattle rustler . Mama done already had the mules hitched up to the wagon when we got back and she just waited long enough to yell at me , " Run for the doctor , Benny , " and they went high-tailin it on down across the pasture . I guess she was so worked up over the whole business she never realized till I got back what it was I had been riding around on  --  over to Mr. Roberts 's place and all the way to Oakville and back . Because by that time her and Mr. Roberts had done loaded him in the wagon and hauled him up to the house and put him in the bed . And Dr. Cunningham had beat me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bran new Buick and I was ridin on Princess and her foolin along takin her own good time so Tar-Baby could keep up . So things was kinda quieted down a little bit when we got back and I guess that 's the first time she happened to think about it . " Lordamercy , child , " she said ' you been ridin that skittish mare all over Chaparral County and she just finished throw-in your daddy off and bustin his head wide open on a rock . " wHEN Dr. Cunningham got back to town that night he telephoned Uncle Mark and Uncle Wayne  --  that 's Papa 's two brothers that live in Austin . But they never come over till the next day because Austin 's forty or fifty miles away and that 's a fur piece . I guess they did n't want to go galivantin around anyhow on a dark night like that . So it must of been nearly dinner-time when they come drivin up in Uncle Wayne 's new Chevrolet . I speck they had to find somebody to run their saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more'n hit the house good till he said he was goin to take the shotgun down off the deer horns and go out there and shoot her . And Mama said , " Not now , Mark . Not yet . He ai n't even regained consciousness yet . " " He ai n't never goin to regain his consciousness , " Uncle Mark said . " That she-devil has done and killed him . And I 'm goin to shoot her between the eyes with a load of buckshot if'n it 's the last thing I ever do . " " It ai n't no sense in that , " Uncle Wayne said . " That ai n't none of Sam 's mare . She belongs with the estate . She 's part yours and part mine . That was Pa 's mare . " " Sho , " Uncle Mark said . " All right . I 'm goin to shoot my part . And I 'll be bound you Sam would thank me for shootin his part if he was able to talk and realize what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do whatever you want to with your part . " " You 're cuttin your nose off to spite your face , " Uncle Wayne said . " She 'd bring a nice piece of money if we was to sell her . " They argued around like that for the longest , and neither one of them ever even mentioned what would happen to Tar-Baby . It looked like they never had even so much as realized that he had n't learned how to eat grass yet . Both of them ought to of knowed it too , because they was raised on the farm right over there across the creek where Grandpa lived before he took sick and died two or three years ago . And they had handled horses a lot . So it ought not to of been necessary for me to have to tell them . But I told them that night when they was settin in there by the cook-stove and Uncle Mark was whittlin on the cedar stick and Uncle Wayne was chewin tobacco and spittin in the wood-box . " He will die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ma , because . he 's too little . He ca n't hustle for hisself . " And Uncle Mark said , " You 're gittin too big for your britches . Stickin your nose in places where it ai n't got no business to be . You better go on to bed where you belong . " So I went on and made out like I was goin to bed . But pretty soon I come on back and snuck in behind the stove , because I had to find out what they was goin to do . I knowed Uncle Mark was the oldest and he usually always had his way about things . But I had to find out for sure . I had n't no more'n set down good till Mama come back in the kitchen with that little book in her hand that Papa used to write in at night . She handed it to Uncle Mark and he opened it and kinda flipped through the leaves and grunted . " Huh , " he said . " So that 's his set of books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might just as well of gone on to bed because it was n't nothin in that book about Tar-Baby . Papa had n't even took the book down from behind the clock since way before the colt was born . I knowed it was n't gain to be nothin but just grown folks talk , but I was afraid to git up and leave because I did n't want Uncle Mark jumpin on me again . He was n't payin no attention to me yet . Hewas lookin in the book . " Ever'thing 's in a fine mess , " he said . " This is a nice time for Sam to curl up his toes and hang up his harness and die . " " What 's the matter ? " Uncle Wayne said . And Uncle Mark closed the book and slapped it down on his knee . " Matter ! " he said . " They 's plenty the matter . How long is it now since Pa died and Sam started lookin after the place ? " " Must be two years , goin on three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because me and you 's done been skunt out of no tellin how much money , " Uncle Mark said . " Because Sam quit keepin books on the place about two years ago . They ai n't a scratch in here to show how much was made on the last two crops .. And Pa 's cattle and the cord wood that 's been sold off of the place . " " Sho now , " Uncle Wayne said . " That 's a pretty kettle of fish . Maybe Mollie knows about them transactions . Maybe she knows how much of mine and your money her and Sam has got in the bank and how many of our cattle 's got mixed up with theirs . " " Yeah , " Uncle Mark snorted . " Sho . Maybe she does . How about it , Mollie ? " And Mama said , " Could n't we just wait till he gets well ? Or at least until he comes out of the coma ? He 's got all them transactions in his head . He knows where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize he 's neglected to write them down , but he can tell you to the last cent what belongs to Grandpa 's place . Could n't we just wait till he regains consciousness ? " " He ai n't pin to never regain consciousness , " Uncle Mark said . " He might linger on a day or two , but he 's a gone goslin . The doe said so hisself . It 's a bone pressin in on his brain . " " We should of had a settlement a long time ago , " Uncle Wayne said . " Like it is now , Sam 's got his money all mixed up with ours . You ca n't tell what belongs to his place and what belongs to the old home place . " " You might as well count Sam out of this deal , " Uncle Mark said . " What you mean is , Mollie 's got a Lot of mine and your money in the bank in her name . I do n't know how you feel about it , Wayne , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know as I got air dime to give away to a widder woman neither , " Uncle Wayne said , " I aim to git my part . " Well , I seen they was clean off the track . They was n't none of ' m thinking about what was goin to happen to Tar-Baby . Anyhow , it looked like his ma was safe until mornin at least , because Uncle Mark had n't even got the gun down to see if it had any shells in it . So I oozed on out the door and went back to the shed-room and went to bed . And the next thing I knowed , the sun was shinin in my face . I r KINDA skeered me at first . And then I realized that Uncle Mark would n't take the trouble to lead her far enough away from the house so I could n't hear the shot . So maybe she was still alive and Tar-Baby had done and got his breakfast all right . Anyhow , I knowed I better be crawlin out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I got up and put on my overalls and shirt and a sweater , because fall of the year was settin in and it was pretty fresh outside . Mama was settin in there in the fireplace room where Papa was layin on the bed , and Grandma was settin in the wheel chair with that wild look out of her eyes and her hair not even combed yet . I looked all around and listened good before I asked her . " Where 's Uncle Mark ? " I said . Because I was afraid he might of got the gun and went off down to the barn . " They left last night , " Mama said . " They went back home so they could open up the saddle shop bright and early this mornin . You ready to eat your breakfast ? " Well , that sho made me feel good . " Yes ma'am , " I told her . " I 'm ready . I wo n't be but just a minute . " And I went flyin out the back door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' m up and put ' m down . And sho ' nough , there he was , prancin around like nobody 's business . And there was his ma , bitin off mouthfuls of grass and chewin it up as unconcerned like she never had even so much as heard of a man named Uncle Mark . So I went back to the house and washed my face and set down to the table and I was feelin like a million dollars . But still I knowed it might not last . So I had to find out . " When they aimin to come back ? " I said . " Tonight maybe ? " " No , " Mama said . " Not unless your pa passes away . They 'll want to have a settlement then . " Well , that made me feel mighty fine . I could of gone ahead to school . Because that was what really had me worried  --  me pin off to school and leavin Uncle Mark there and the shotgun on the deer horns with a whole box of shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just hang around the house and she would write a note to the teacher the next day . So it looked like ever'thing was goin to be all right until about the middle of the evenin when this satchel-packin city bird come drivin up to the front gallery and got out and come in . He had n't no more'n got in the house and set down good till he told Mama that Mr. Mark and Mr. Wayne Garwood had sent him over . When I heard that , my pulse beat ris a notch or two , because I thought maybe they had hired him to shoot the Princess , or maybe kill her in some kind of a citified way , like with an electric wire or poison gas . But pretty soon I could tell it was just the same old stuff  --  all about the cattle and crops and cord wood on our place and how some of it had maybe creeped across the creek from Grandpa 's place , because Grandpa had died two or three years ago and they had moved Grandma over to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there and hirin a bunch of hands to work the crops . " They are goin to sue you , " the man said . " They have retained me to fix up the papers and file the suit . " And Mama said , " I ca n't help it . It ai n't nothin I can do . But ca n't they even wait to see if he is goin to live or die ? " " You do n't understand , " the man said . " They will enter suit right after the funeral . They 've got art open and shut case . " And Mama said , " Yes , I reckon they have . But why did you come and tell me about it ? What do they want me to do ? " " It might be we could settle it out of court , " he said . " Maybe if you would write them out a check for two or three thousand dollars . Maybe we could agree on a sum . But of course you would have to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for his part . You could n't touch a thing  --  not even Mr. Samuel 's bank account  --  until you had got yourself bonded and legally appointed your son 's guardian . You could n't sell a cow , nor a pig even , until you had done that . " " I do n't know , " Mama said . " I do n't know if we even got a dime in the bank . Sam always handled the money matters . " So pretty soon I seen it was n't nothin but grown folks talk . He had n't come to shoot her or electrocute her or poison gas her . Like as not he had n't never even heard of a mare named Princess , let alone knowin she had a coal black colt named Tar-Baby . So I went on out to the barn to give her some feed and watch him stick his head in the trough with her and blow his nose and kick up his heels and caper around like he was somebody come . That night Elmer Doolittle and Uncle Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really my uncle . He ai n't even no blood-kin . He 's a old old man that owns the store down at the crossroads and ever ' body in Chaparral County knows him and calls him Uncle Jimmy . But they do n't nobody call Elmer Mr. Doolittle . I do n't know why , because he 's as old as Papa and he owns a sight of land in the Bend . Anyhow , they had n't no more'n got set down good till Elmer wanted to know where 's Mark and Wayne . And Mamatold him they went home about ten o'clock last night because they had to run the shop and make saddles and cowboy boots and belts and stuff . " You mean they went off home after I left ? " Elmer said . " I thought they was here to stay . Who set up last night ? " And Mama told him she did . So one thing led to another and pretty soon they got to talkin about that same stuff again . Mama told them how the money and cattle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two farms and how the lawyer from Austin had come over and set a spell with her . But I did n't pay no attention to it , because by that time I had done and heard it three or four times . Finally I thought they had got done talkin about it , because Elmer and Uncle Jimmy told Mama they had come to set up all night and they made a big pot of coffee and told her to fix off to bed . They told me too , but I was n't a bit sleepy . So she helped Grandma git her nightgown on and git out of the wheel chair and into the bed and then she said good-night and turned in too . But I stayed there by the fireplace because Uncle Jimmy knows a lot about the Indians and the Alamo and the Texas Rangers and I thought maybe he might git wound up like he does sometimes down at the store and tell about how it was in the old days . " That 's pretty good , " Elmer said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nigh onto three years . Now they ca n't wait till Sam 's in his grave to hire a shyster lawyer from Austin to come over here and try to beat her out of the last red cent she 's got . if that do n't take the rag off the bush . " " She , " Uncle Jimmy said . " That 's gratitude for you . Me and you better saddle over to Silver City tomorrow and talk to old Cap 'm Jenkins . He 's the best lawyer in the state of Texas . He 'll build a fire under that city slicker 's tail . " S 0 THERE we was again  --  back on the same old subject . And I was just about ready to give up and go on to bed . But it was something Elmer said that made me stay . " No , " he said . " They 've got a good case against her and they know it . And besides , it ai n't but one thing that will ever satisfy me . I 'll prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to do it . " And Uncle Jimmy said , " What 's that ? " " It 's to see him git well , " Elmer said . " To see him rise up out of that bed and take that shotgun down off of them deer horns and shoot both of them square between the eyes with a load of buckshot . " " Sho now , " Uncle Jimmy said . " If we only could . " Well , maybe you think that did n't make me set up and listen . Because I did n't see why Elmer wanted Papa to shoot Tar-Baby too . It was n't his fault . He did n't even have no hand in it . " He needs a specialist , " Elmer said . " A man that can perform a delicate operation on a cook-table and take that piece of bone off of his brain . So he can git well and git up out of that bed and load that gun and aim accurate and pull the trigger . " " Sho , " Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's Raymond Morgan , " Elmer said , " that was born and raised right here in the Bend . You recollect Ray , do n't you ? " " I recollect him , " Uncle Jimmy said . " I hear tell he 's done and gone to New York now . " Elmer cut hisself a chew of tobacco and put it in his right-hand jaw like he had done figured it all out . " That 's right , " he said . " He 's a brain specialist . I reckon it 's more folks in New York with something the matter with their heads than it is in Texas . I reckon it 'll take a heap of money to git him down here on a airplane , but I 'm goin to personally foot the bill myself . " " Wo n't them boogers rare up on their hind legs when they hear about it ! " Uncle Jimmy said . " They 'll figure that money creeped across the creek from the old man 's cattle and crops and cord wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JIVE be a sight to see . And the only pay ever expect will be a ringside seat at the shootin . " " Folks around in the Bend says Ray Morgan ai n't never found hisself no wife yet , " Uncle Jimmy said . " That ai n't neither here nor there , " Elmer said . " A doctor do n't need to work in double harness . I reckon a single man can handle a knife just as well as a married man . " " He used to spark Mollie like it was pretty serious before she up and married Sam , " Uncle Jimmy said . " Folks always said she kinda give him the run-around while he was off at school . " " Sho , " Elmer said . " Yes . I see what you mean . It would be a temptation . Mollie 's still mighty young and pretty . " " A slip of the knife , " Uncle Jimmy said , " a nice funeral , and a few months to wait . He 'd have her right back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temptation a right smart , " Elmer said , " if we stand behind him with a six-shooter and kinda steady his nerve . If his hand slips , I 'd have to tend to them other two . I might just as well make it a crowd . " " It 's your party , " Uncle Jimmy said . " Go ahead on . " So Elmer said he was goin to town to use the telephone , and he went outside and cranked up his car and drove off . W ELL , by that time I was layin down on the floor with my head on my old red houn'dog and I guess I was gittin pretty sleepy . " Why do n't you git up and pull your clothes off and go to bed right ? " Uncle Jimmy told me . So I got up and set down in the chair like grown folks . " I thought bein as Elmer 's gone , " I said , " maybe you 'd tell me a story . " " Sho , " Uncle Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The one about the Indians stealin your horses , " I said . " You 've heard that one seventy-five or thirty times , " Uncle Jimmy said . " You want to hear it again ? " " Yes , " I told him . " Tell it like you always used to . And do n't leave out none of it . " " Sho , " Uncle Jimmy said . " If you 'll go to bed then . Just that one . " " All right , " I said . And he cut hisself a fresh chew of tobacco and rared back in his chair and told it . He did n't leave out a bit . And jeez , it was fine . And I went on back to the shed-room and pulled off my clothes and crawled in . Things was pretty quiet the next day or two until Elmer come down to the lot where I was feedin Tar-Baby a little sugar . " You want to ride over to Austin with me ? " he said . " I b'lieve not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Uncle Mark and Uncle Wayne ? " " No , " he said . " Not today . That will come later . I 'm goin over to meet the airplane comin in from New York . " So I changed my tune and went with him . And commn on back we had the doctor in the car with us  --  not Dr. Cunningham but the New York doctor . We went by the hospital , and him and Elmer loaded in a bunch of junk and we come truckin on home . Once he looked at me and said , " Well , well , so this is Mollie 's boy , is it ? " And Elmer said , " Yes . It sho God is , and it 's Sam 's boy , and we got to git Sam up out of that bed because he 's got to git that gun down off of them deer horns and practice up on his shootin lessons . " " You did n't mean Tar-Baby too , did you ? " I said . And Elmer said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my colt , " I said . " I guess he ai n't exactly mine , though . Because the Princess used to belong to Grandpa but Grandpa died and now she belongs to Uncle Mark and Uncle Wayne and Papa . So who would Tar-Baby belong to ? " " That 's pretty complicated , " Elmer said . " But just as soon as we git a few matters settled , I speck things will be simplified considerable . It wo n't be nowhere near as many heirs to Tar-Baby . " " You had me skeered until we got out of Austin , " I told Elmer . " I thought maybe you might be aimin to bring Uncle Mark back with us . " " No , " Elmer said . " He 'll come on over later . On the train , I guess . In the baggage car . Uncle Wayne too . I speck they 'd have a hankerin to be planted in the peach orchard alongside their pa. " o wE come on home and got out and S went in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on in the fireplace room where Papa was , but they shut me out . I seen the six-shooters stickin out of Uncle Jimmy 's hip pockets , so I thought maybe they had changed their minds . Maybe the doctor was goin to cure Papa and Uncle Jimmy was goin to let him use the pistols instead of the shotgun . Anyhow , I went on down to the barn and put the bridle on the Princess and rode clean down to the back side of the pasture and Tar-Baby scamperin along with us . Grown folks is funny . Because I never heard no more about the business for several days . The doctor had done left by that time and flew back to New York . Elmer and Uncle Jimmy had come over to set a spell and Papa was propped up in bed eatin a bowl of soup . It was Elmer that brought up the subject again . " Sam , " he said , " you ' bout ready to crawl out of there and oil up your gun ? " And Papa said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gad ought to . I ai n't even seen them two since the mare stepped in that hole and I busted my head . " " Because if you ai n't goin to do it , " Elmer said , " / am goin to personally shoot them both between the eyes and drag their carcass off out in the pasture for the buzzards to have a picnic on . " And then Mama ris up and put her hands on her hips . " You just as well to shut up , both of you , " she said . " Because it ai n't goin to be no shootin done around here . Them two saved Sam 's life . " And Elmer said " Well , I 'll be durned . If it would n't take a woman to add up the whole business and come out with a answer like that . " " Sho now , " Uncle Jimmy said . " I see what you mean , Mollie . And besides , Elmer ai n't got no ringside seat comin , because Ray Morgan never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mama said . " Them two saved his life , sho as the world . " Well , I did n't see how Tar-Baby had done much of anything to help him save his life . And the Princess had done a right smart to help him lose it , even if she did n't mean to . But I never said nothin . So she went ahead givin him his nourishment and pretty soon she learned him how to eat grass . That was maybe a month ago . And jeez , you ought to see him now !
