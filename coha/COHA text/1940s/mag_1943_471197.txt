WHEN , in convoy , the sun goes down and the order " Darken ship ! " is piped , one has a feeling that the dividing line is being crossed from the comparative tranquillity of daylight to the hazard and the startling crudity of things that go bump in the night . It 's a sort of private signal that the party is once more on , a moment which has come to mean a great deal on board our corvette , and it is attended with caredeadlights are dropped and screwed home , screens rigged at the mess-deck entrances , the shutters of the bridge and the wheelhouse put in place and secured . Then the duty petty officer makes his rounds ? meticulous rounds , the most important made either at sea or in harbor ; and when he comes up to the bridge and reports the ship darkened , one thinks : well , the convoy may be for it ? we may be for it ourselves ? but at least we 're giving no chances and leaving no ends hanging out . Going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded is now aroutine which somehow never loses its significance or fails in its effect , and the start of the routine has itself become almost a ritual . Time , possibly , one A.m . ( Good old middle watch ; it gets all the knocks there are . ) " Captain , sir ! " " What is it ? " " Second ship , starboard wing column , torpedoed , sir . They 're firing star shells the other side . " " Very good . Sound off action-stations. be up in a second . " When I am relieved of the watch I make my way down the ladder and across the boat deck ; below me in the waist there is a clumping of sea boots as the thrower crews run aft to close up and clear away for action . There 's time to look round as I cross the deck in darkness , ducking under the funnel-guy which I can not see but which comes two steps after the last boiler-room grating , and always the view ? or lack of it ? is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer , the silhouette of a nearby ship , the glow from a flare , perhaps already the flickering lights low down on the water which mean lowered boats and rafts . Then the cox'n passes me on his way forrard to take over the wheel ; and I say ( as always ) : " A fine night , ' swain , " and he says : " Let 's drop a few for luck this time , sir "  - -  another ritual which marks the occasion as an authentic one . Leaning against the rail by the ensign-staff , I can see below me the thrower crews standing by waiting for their orders ; farther aft there is a group of spare numbers ? off-watch stokers and communication-ratings ? ready to bear a hand in reloading . Farthest aft of all , I can just make out the Seaman-Torpedoman bending over his depth-charge rails ; as soon as he sees me silhouetted above him he calls out : " All ready , sir , " in a voice half formal , half eager . I happen to know that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a murmur of voices , some of them angrily blasphemous ? we all realize what those lights on the water mean ; from long practice we can translate them accurately into loss of life , disablement , mutilation . Standing ready in the darkness , we hope for luck and action . Strange people come to the surface when action-stations is sounded ? stokers I had no idea were on board , rare faces that never otherwise see the light of day . When " antiaircraft stations " was sounded I put my tin hat on and climbed up through the dusk to the after-gun turret . Under a clear frosty sky the gun 's crew stood silent , watching , waiting , possibly nervous . I said something or other , and they laughed and relaxed ? five young men steel-helmeted and closely wrapped against the cold , the white tops of their sea-boot stockings standing out in the gloom ; five young men listening for sound above the ordinary disregarded sound of the ship and the sea , staring at the stars across which the mast swung a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the stocky gun barrel cocked up at the sky like a jauntily raised thumb , was to be reassured . . . . And then I heard the sound we were waiting for . Far away on the other wing of the convoy a single line of tracer fled upward ; and without an order being given the crew closed up round their gun , the safety catch clicked , and the layer slapped the breech with his mittened hand and said : " Come on , Rosie , win me a medal . " .. e .. cva A huge column of water is thrown up after a near-miss ; it rises gray and white , edged with foam , higher than the ship , hiding it completely , so that for all we know it may have been hit . But when the turmoil subsides there is the ship still plowing on ; and you look at it and think : " I bet that brought ' em up on deck with their braces dangling . " aceo Sometimes a single bomb falls , very wide of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is closed . It 's odd to think that a bomber may have flown a thousand miles to drop that one bomb ten thousand feet through the clouds a mile and a half from the nearest ship , after which it turns round and heads for home again . . . . But that does n't seem to alter the score as far as Goebbels is concerned . I remember one occasion when , after a profitless and none too intrepid attack on the convoy by two Junkers-88 's , no damage of any sort being done , we tuned in to Haw-Haw the same evening . " This morning , " said that snarling voice , " aircraft of our gallant Luftwaffe attacked an important convoy 500 miles southwest of the Scilly Isles . Two ships were sunk , one of 5,000 and the other of 2,000 tons ; both have their whole sides ripped off ; and others were damaged . " Query : Is this Goebbels ' own make-up , or is it based on the actual report of the aircraft concerned ? If it 's the aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of whom know it to be a pack of lies . And if it 's Goebbels , how foolish the airmen must feel to be given false credit , and how mistrustful of their own propaganda . But now and then it is they who have the luck . After a quiet and unscathed journey of some 2,300 miles and fifteen days , it is depressing to lose a ship on your own front doorstep to some bloody little aircraft returning from a raid with one spare bomb . Among the minor trials of the middle watch are the porpoises which , with relish and great agility , play submarines at night ? i.e. , come darting at the ship 's side at right angles and then pass underneath with a swirl of phosphorescence . You get used to these April Fools after a bit , and almost feel like joining in the fun yourself , but the first few times you find yourself ducking . eba There develops unavoidably a certain tension aboard as we approach the U-boat danger zone ? when we know that at any moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some action which will test nerve and skill to the utmost . The feeling affects the whole ship , and it is almost a relief when the first explosion is heard and the first flare goes up , and you think : " Oh , well , this is it . " But the tension for us is really nothing compared with what it must be for the ships in convoy , and the amount of self-discipline and nerve needed to remain in station after another ship has been torpedoed . We at least have the relief ? and possibly the safety ? of action ; we can crack on a few revs , fling ourselves about a bit , strike back formidably if the opportunity arises ; but they have to wallow along as if nothing had happened ? same course and station , same inadequate speed , same helpless target . Imagine being on the bridge of a tanker loaded deep with benzine that a spark might send sky-high and seeing the ship alongside struck by a torpedo , or another torpedo slipping past your stern , and doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working half-naked many feet below the water line , hearing the crack of explosions , knowing exactly what they mean , and staying down there on the job ? shoveling coal or turning wheels , concentrating , making no mistakes , disregarding what you know may be only a few yards away and pointing straight at you . No amount of publicity , no colorful write-ups , no guff about " the little silver badge , " above all , no medals , can do honor to men like these . Buy them a drink ashore if you like , but do n't attempt an adequate recompense . You wo n't get in the target area . HE first thing you notice when a ship has gone down is a hateful smell of oil on the water . ( We grew to loathe that smell : as well as a ship sunk , it meant survivors drenched with fuel oil , coughing it up , poisoned by it . ) But there is always an amazing amount of stuff left on the surface ? crates , planks , baulks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits of clothing ? a restless smear of debris , looking like a wrecked jumble sale , on which the searchlight plays . Here and there lights may be flickering ; too often they are not the ship 's boats you are hoping for , but empty rafts with automatic calcium flares attached to them , burning uselessly , mute witnesses to disaster . As soon as you come upon the scene you feel you must search it all thoroughly , you feel you must prowl round and miss nothing ; you also kmvti that you are not the only prowler , that even as you circle a raft or wait for a laden boat to come alongside , someone in the dark outer ring may be taking a sight of you , preparing as you loiter to run a fish and teach you the same lesson . Perhaps among the wreckage a white face or a raised arm appears ? can you afford to wait , are they worth the risk of salvage , or will one more chance , one more effort of mercy ; forfeit your ship ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there still left ? In semidarkness we passed a dead man floating upright , supported by his life jacket . We shouted at him , but he stared back in silence . To cover up , a stoker called out : " So you wo n't talk , eh ? " and there was a tiny laugh , a whisper of mirth drowned in pity . Uncannily , some high jabbering voices came out of the darkness : the engine-room telegraph rang SLOW and then STOP , and presently we saw ahead of us a bobbing black spot ? one of the ship 's boats we were looking for . We hailed it from the bridge , and were answered by a torrent of Chinese . I thought , " God , this is going to be difficult . . . . " The wailing of high voices continued , almost operatic in its pattern ? like a slice of " Aida " cut thin and slipped into a twenty-foot boat in mid-Atlantic ; and then , breaking through them like a soloist with a will of his own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whole damn lot of you . " The boat came alongside , a Welsh second officer at the helm . Someone in it started flashing a torch carelessly and was stopped by a crisp order through a megaphone from the bridge . We took off twenty-two Chinese firemen ? " They must have sunk a laundry , " said H. to me as we counted them coming over the side ? and then the boat , with revolver bullets through her planking and buoyancy tanks , was set adrift , though not before a certain number of rescuers ' perquisites ? oars , blocks , shackles , spare water-breaker ? had been prudently salvaged and borne aboard . They had that round score of Chinese sleeping in the mess decks for the rest of the trip . A signalman said to me one morning , reflectively : " It 's funny to wake up , sir , and see all those new faces . " Valuable time is taken up in lowering a boat and bringing it in again , but it is often the quickest way of picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb aboard and too slippery with oil to be pulled up . I was once in charge of a boat which was sent away on this job one dark night when a fairly high sea was running and I remember the jextraordinary difficulty we had in getting inboard men who had been in the water for nearly four hours , who were almost paralyzed with cold , and whose clothes ( and in some cases their naked bodies ) were so saturated with fuel oil that it was like trying to land enormous greasy fish with one 's bare hands . A short steep swell , that seemed to lift us up and flick us about like a chip of wood , did n't make things any easier . This particular lot were lucky in having life jackets with lights attached to them ; otherwise we should never have seen them from the bridge in the first place . ( These lights ? they are small naked bulbs clipped to the life jacket and connected to a battery in the breast pocket ? have been the salvation of countless men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of countless more ; a man in the water at night is almost impossible to see , and his voice , even in still weather , is lost in engine and water noises . ) I forget how many we collected ? about thirteen , I think , including a man so badly injured that it seemed hardly worth while giving him the extra agony of being handled . . . . When we got alongside again we bundled them over the side , the boat surging with every wave so that sometimes they could step straight aboard and sometimes could not even reach the foot of the ladder ; the slightly nightmare quality of the occasion was heightened by the pitch darkness , the injured man 's groans , and the thunderous noise of the chain ladder against the ship 's side . Soon there remained only the bad casualty to be dealt with . " Send a stretcher down for this one , " I called up to the ship , and when it was passed we strapped him in , handling him as gently as the tossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then a sling was rigged , and they started to heave in . But as he swung in mid-air the boat rose to a huge wave and lurched against the ship 's side ? or where it would have been if the stretcher had not been in the way . I felt that blow in my own guts . The man screamed once , sharply . I called out to the bow-oar , " Hold her off , for Christ 's sake , " and to the men on the tackle , " Heave away all you know ? get him clear . " It was of course too Iate , and I was glad it was dark . I did n't want to catch anyone 's eye just then . But the moment could be wiped out in action . " Cox'n ! " " Yes , sir ? " " How many hands up there ? " " Cleared lower deck , sir . " " Very good . . . . Pass the falls . " And to the hands with me in the boat , " Hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Haul taut singly ! ; ; ; Hoist away ! " That was that : the best we could do . eon We once had a Negro survivor who would not strip or let himself be warmed or drink anything . All he wanted to do ? all he would do ? was to curl up in a ball with his head between his legs and be left to himself . We covered him up with a blanket ( which he immediately drew over his head ) and let him Tie . The Cox'n , looking down at him , said : " It 's his religion , sir , " which for some reason seemed a completely fitting explanation . eAte@ Another Negro was brought aboard dead ; he was well-formed , stark naked , and already stiffening as he was hauled over the side . I put my hand out to feel his heart ; the skin I touched was cold butvery smooth and well-muscled . " Waste of time , sir ? " said the sick-berth attendant , giving his voice a slight note of question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cover him up and let 's get on with the others . " The body , lashed to the rail , made a dark smudge in the port waist all night , stirring when the ship rolled ; now and then a patter of spray touched the sewn-up blanket . The cook , leaving his galley to bring the wardroom breakfast forrard , eyed it , retraced his steps , and came forrard by the starboard alleyway . . . At ten o'clock , to the survivors ' captain , three Lascar seamen , and a small muster of hands , I read the burial service ; and then , at a signal to the bridge , the telegraph rang , the engines paused for a moment , and the neat weighted package went over the side . Survivors in the mess decks , filling every available space ? asleep on the deck , on benches , against bulkheads ; sitting at tables with their heads between their hands , talking , shivering , wolfing food , staring at nothing . Some of them half-naked , wrapped in blankets and wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugged close ; puzzled black faces , pinched yellow ones , tired bleary white masks that still muster a grin . Men half-dead , men cocky as be-damned ; men suffering from exposure , frostbite , fuel oil poisoning , cuts , gashes , broken limbs ; men hanging to life by a wet thread . The bravest man I have yet met was a survivor , a Yorkshire seaman with a broken thigh and a fearful gash across his face . As I paused in strapping up his leg , wondering whether he could stand any more of it , he said : " Co on ? I 've a bit saved up yet " ; and when I was unskillfully stitching his wound : " Now then , lad , none of your hemstitching ? I 'm not as particular as all that . " I ca n't remember any men who were not brave and patient in suffering , but he holds the record so far . Going forrard to attend to casualties was sometimes like stepping into a nightmare ; but it was lighted here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as could only beget confidence and pride . cow Survivors in the wardroom , eating us out of house and home ; their bare feet on the carpet , their odd scraps of uniform , their wet life jackets which they do not discard ? all these are stock properties in our theater of war . They have a habit of dozing off in awkward attitudes , but they look up and smile when one of us comes off watch and puts his head inside the room . Often they yarn to us about their previous escapes , or produce photographs of their homes and families and hand them round . Once , rather sadly , a Belgian captain talked of Leopold and what his surrender had meant to Belgian merchant seamen then at sea . It was this captain who made us a formal speech of thanks , self-conscious but manifestly sincere , on the last night of the trip , when we had drinks all round in the wardroom and they toasted their rescuers . People seize on odd things when the order " Abandon ship ! " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing all his papers and four months ' pay , but had pocketed a large shoehorn , quite unconsciously . vas When I am ashore and hear ( as I have heard ) one man telling another that he can get as much petrol as he wants by licensing all four of his cars and using only one of them ; when I see photographs of thousands of cars at a race meeting for which a special fast train service is run ; when I read a letter to a newspaper complaining that the writer has had difficulty in obtaining extra petrol for the grouse-shooting season ; when I hear of any instance of more than the bare essential minimum of petrol being used , I think of a torpedoed tanker ablaze at sea , with all its accompanying horrors . That 's your extra ten gallons of petrol , sir and madam ; that 's last week 's littlewangle with the garage on the corner . You might remember what you 're burning , now and then ; its real basic coupon is a corpse-strewn Atlantic . It can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on our behavior when next we ran into trouble ? there was certainly a reluctance to go below . Many of the crew slept on the upper deck or the gun platform ; some of the officers dossed down on the bridge , and even failed to complain when they were relieved late . We took home two of her survivors , signalmen , and very thoughtful they looked the whole time . In fact it was art odd , faintly unpleasant , and almost affecting reminder of their ordeal and our own hazard to come upon them at night , as I did when I came off watch . Usually they would both be standing outside the wheelhouse , sleepless , strained , silent , and ( I suppose ) remembering . I once tried to talk to one of them on my way down and found it impossible . Staring at the water , he was out of small-talk altogether . Lieutenant R. told me that he was in the wheelhouse with a sub-lieutenant who was drowned . He told me that his ship , turning under half-helm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boiler room ; there was a big explosion , the ship gave a tremendous lurch to starboard , right on to her beam-ends , and broke in half ; both ends then started to sink , bows and stern upward . R. climbed up till he was standing on the engine-room telegraph and when he was already under water succeeded in opening the wheelhouse door , which was by that time above his head . He held his breath and shot to the surface . There was a lot of oil about but not much wreckage ; he found a cordite-case to hang on to , and a seaman with him got astride a mine-sweeping float . They were then picked up by us . Others saved included all the bridge personnel , a lookout who was in the A.A. bandstand , and another lookout in the crow 's nest , who waited until the mast touched the water and then swam out . A large number of the crew were in the port waist , just over the explosion , and must have been killed by it . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of oil , came aboard suffering from what I thought was fuel oil poisoning . He was walking about normally ( though of course feeling a bit under the weather ) for at least twelve hours ; but when a doctor from a destroyer came aboard to take over my three worst casualties , R. complained that he was feeling ill and was put to bed . Though he got rid of most of the oil , he became worse ; the doctor diagnosed a ruptured kidney or some internal hemorrhage , and we proceeded home at full speed . He was in my cabin and I spent a good deal of time with him . He asked perpetually : " How long before we get in ? Ca n't we go any faster ? How far is it now ? " and it was clear that he was simply fading out , in a way very distressing to watch . He was conscious when taken ashore , but died in hospital the same night . When he had survived so much , and actually had been walking about after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died after all . We cruised slowly round the raft , looking at it through our binoculars . It seemed lifeless and completely derelict : a tattered piece of cloth stuck up on a pole ? the first thing to catch the lookout 's attention ? was all that stirred in a picture utterly forlorn . I counted , as best I could , the untidy jumble of forms that lay round the pole in the center . " Seven , I think , sir . None of them moving . " " We 'll go alongside . " When the raft was hooked on I jumped down and began turning them over , though as soon as I had touched the first one 's arm I knew that it was hopeless . We were too late by many days and nights . . . . But there was something in their attitudes , not of strain but of longed-for abandon , which seemed to say that these men had not , after a time , fought against death . That was the only thing on the credit side : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced release , and had been able to realize it . Another time was unrelieved by any compensations . Half a gale blowing , the sea very rough , and a raft with three survivors clinging to it . We got a line across and took two of them off , and then the line snubbed and parted . Coming as close as we could , we threw another which fell right across the raft , but the man made no effort to secure it and it was swept into the sea again . " What 's the matter with him ? " I asked . " We ca n't do anything unless he wakes up and takes a hand himself . " " He 's awake , all right , " answered one of the rescued men , " but he ca n't move . Broken arm and leg . He told us to go first . He 's the mate . " We tried to get alongside , but it was n't possible in that sea ; and swimming was out of the question , though there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ieave him . . . . As we drew away , he waved to us ? not a summons , but a sort of half salute . Then he lay down again . eas Ships do n't always sink , no matter how big a fish they have stopped . We once brought home a torpedoed tanker with a hole like Elijah 's cave in her side , into which the sea washed like surf into a bay . But she was well built , and her bulkheads held . They held , in fact , for four hundred miles at three knots . On such a journey as this you learn what patience is , and nervousness too . III O N ONE voyage we had a seven-day party ? reconnaissance planes or bombers appearing again and again ; a bad U-boat attack on the third night , when some ships in the convoy were sunk ; a bombing on the morning of the sixth day . But the real climax did n't come until the seventh night . It started fairly early too : the first attack came at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went up ; after carrying out the sweep ordered by the Senior Officer we saw lights on the water and altered course toward them . Soon we came upon the usual muck drifting about ? oil , dust , pieces of wood , corpses , clothing ; then we heard voices shouting out of the darkness , and saw a cluster of men swimming ; they were singing " Roll Out the Barrel " in chorus . We laughed when we heard that , and a rating in the waist called out " Good lads ! We 're coming ! " and the men in the water shouted back : " Three cheers for the Navy ! " I think most of us aft thought it should be " Three cheers for the Merchant Navy . " We lowered a boat and collected all we could find . Some of them , wounded and swimming in oil up to three hours , were already survivors from another ship , torpedoed four days before and rescued by the ship which had now itself gone down . One of them , clinging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hurry up ! I ca n't hold on much longer , " as we approached , and then , over and over again in a gasping voice , " Christ , I 'm done ! Christ , I 'm done ! " When he saw us drawing away again , not knowing that we had lowered a boat , he started screaming , " Do n't go away ! You bloody cowards , do n't go away 1 " We collected about thirty all told , picked up our boat again , and set a course for the convoy . I was working nearly two hours in the mess decks , attending to casualties ( two internal , two badly gashed in the head , five minor cuts , and some needing treatment for shock ) ; half way through , H. came forrard and gave me a glass of whiskey , which I needed . At about two o'clock , when I was on the bridge again standing my watch , two more ships were hit ; from one of them flames shot into the air and soonshe was ablaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evolutions ordered , and once more dropped back to see if we could help the rescue ships . The burning oil on the water now covered about a square half-mile , an immense wall of flame , topped by a huge smoke-pall drifting away to leeward , which lit up the sea for miles around ; we closed this , looking for survivors which the others might have missed . If you want to know what tension is , or wish to gage a captain 's responsibility at such a moment , try stopping engines when silhouetted against solid flame , with an unknown number of submarines prowling round . We could see other corvettes , intent on the same job as ourselves , crossing and recrossing , black against yellow and red , and we could not help thinking : " That 's the sort of target we 're making . . . . " But we finished it at last , and started off again ; and then ahead of us we saw another explosion , and flames going up in the air , and then sudden darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a quick one , " and almost immediately we got a signal to say that it had been one of the escorts , torpedoed and sunk . I can recall the sense of shock which that signal brought to the bridge . Of course other ships had been sunk , but this was an escort vessel , one of our group , manned by fellow-sailors doing the same job as we and supposedly strong enough to be immune . . . . The blended feeling of rage and depression lasted till dawn ? dawn , when another ship , a straggler far away from any effective cover , was shelled by a U-boat and had to be abandoned . This was the last casualty , and it rounded off , with originality , an eventful night and ( as it turned out ) an eventful seven days . I think we were all a little sad by the time we got in . We had been at action-stations for virtually a week on end , missing hours of sleep , eating on the bridge or the upper deck , standing-to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the aircraft plaguing us continually , and the U-boats hunting , striking , losing , hunting , and striking again ; we had watched ships ? too many ships go down , and heard of our friends being killed , and seen men drowning and had to leave them to it ; we had grown sick of destruction , light-headed with tiredness and strain , And above all , we had felt ineffective ; even though we knew that other escorts had struck back with notable effect , there had probably been nine submarines round us , and you ca n't do miracles ? they had simply played hide-and-seek with the convoy , and a ripe game it was . . . . By the end we had had enough of it , though if it had gone on I suppose we should have done the same . In fact , I know we should . That is the main thing about a convoy : it does n't retreat , or reform on a new line , or execute a strategic withdrawal to previously prepared positions . It sails on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wishing none . I U NEXPECTEDLY , the U-boat surfaced about two miles ahead of us . I do n't know why she came up . Perhaps we had kept her down too long , or she thought she would try her luck at a shooting match , or she may even not have heard us ; but we did n't waste time with speculations just then . Our first shot fell short , our second was dead in line , but over , and our third plowed the water just where she had crash-dived again . We dropped a pattern of depth charges for luck , on her estimated diving position , and then began a proper sweep . We picked her up almost immediately and ran in and dropped another pattern ; this brought up some oil . Out on a wide turn , and in again ; once more the charges went over the side ; once more , after a pause , there came that series of splitting crashes from below which told us they had well and truly done their stuff . Another run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast activity -- firing , reloading , priming , setting ; then the awaited signal from the bridge , and downwent the charges and presently the surface of the sea jumped and boiled , and the Torpedoman rubbed his hands and called out happily : " Next for shaving ! " More oil and big air bubbles ; we had the measure of him now . . . . I spoke on the bridge voice-pipe to H. , who said we were doing well and ordered another , rather special pattern . " I 'm not sure I can manage that , " I told him . " I 'll have to give you the nearest size to it . " Momentarily the Chief popped his head out of the engine-room companionway . " Is n't he sunk yet , sir ? " he asked . " We 're getting properly shaken up down here . " One more run , one more series of thunderous cracks , and then the sea , spouting and boiling , threw up what we were waiting for ? oil in a spreading stain , bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Contact failed after that , and though we waited till dusk nothing else worth collecting made its appearance . We had enough in any case . It was a dog 's death , but how triumphant we felt ? a triumph clinched later that night by a signal of congratulation from the Commander-in-Chief . And in the morning came another moment ? perhaps the real moment ? of the sweetness of success . We found the convoy , from which we had been detached nearly twenty-four hours before ; and as soon as we were in sight the Senior Officer signaled , " Well met and well done . Steam down the center of the convoy ; they want to give you a big hand . " And so it was . When we came level with the head of the convoy the Commodore hoisted " Congratulations " ; it was repeated by every ship , and as we steamed down the ranks each ship waved and cheered . It made up for much of the preceding winter . The last ship of all , a puzzled Greek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , signifying " Signal flags read but not yet understood . " " Bunting-tosser 's asleep , " said our own signalman , outraged by the occurrence ; but we took the will for the deed . We had worked a long time for that signal : steamed thousands of miles , been bored for days and weeks on end , spent scores of nights at the alert in wet and freezing darkness , sent and received thousands of signals . Over three hundred middle watches had gone to it , weeks of eyestrain , filthy weather in plenty , and God knows how many blasts from Senior Officer , from Flag-Officer-in-Charge , from the heart of Whitehall . .. . Only one more submarine , when it came to notching the stick , but it settled , a longer score than that for us . Another corvette in the same group had some U-boat prisoners aboard , whomshe used to exercise every day on the upper deck . H. and I examined them one morning through our binoculars as we passed close by ? they looked a scruffy lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , but stood in the waist , staring out at the convoy , which was an exceptionally large one . Many of them , we could see , were frowning . " Surly bastards ! " grumbled H. to me , as we watched them . " They 're damned lucky to be alive . " " No , they do n't look surly to me , " I answered him . I indicated the convoy , forging ahead to England , as compact and as strong as ever . " I think they 're surprised . In fact , probably they can hardly believe their eyes . "
