THE HEMISPHERE <P> In Bogot 's narrow , crowded streets , diplomats needed half an hour to drive ten blocks to the opening session of the ninth International Conference of American States . It took them hardly longer to get down to business , once they convened in the refurbished brownstone Capitolio Nacional . For these representatives of the 21 American republics , two issues overshadowed all others : 1 ) U.S. economic aid for Latin America , the subject latinos held most vital ; 2 ) Communism in the hemisphere , and how to deal with it . <P> As soon as Colombia 's ruddy-faced Foreign Minister Laureano Gmez had been elected conference president , the economic issue was opened . It was Mexico 's eloquent Foreign Minister Jaime Torres Bodet who ripped into it . " Of course European reconstruction is urgent , " he argued , " but is development less urgent when the peoples who seek it live as misrably as most of those who clamor for reconstruction ? " Latin America 's Indian millions , he thundered , are " the martyrs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen latinos jumped to embrace Torres Bodet as he went back to his seat . That night he was the talk of every cocktail party in town . <P> Next day George Marshall answered for the U.S. His Government , he said , would ask World Bank loans for Latin America , and make fresh funds available for new loans from the Export-Import Bank . But the kind of economic development Latin America needed , he said , was simply beyond the U.S. Government 's capacity . His suggestion for latinos : invite private capital to help . To show that this need not mean economic bondage , he cited the use the U.S. made of foreign capital in its i gth Century industrialization . <P> Heroes in Common . Then Marshall put aside his manuscript and really laid it on the line . With an obvious reference to Torres Bodet , he said quietly : " I feel that what has already been said , and I suppose is yet to be said , refers ... to my country . ... I have also the feeling that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . the people of my country have undertaken . . . and that you profit by it as much as we do . " <P> Turning to the 30-ft. mural behind him depicting Simn Bolvar 's inaugural in 1821 as Colombia 's President , George Marshall recalled that Lieut . General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr . had died leading U.S. troops on Okinawa in World War II . That Buckner , who gave his life , bore " the name of your great Liberator , " he said , " certainly indicates something of our common purpose and our common bond . " <P> Latinos applauded , but only Peru 's Victor Andrs Belaunde and two Nicaraguans shook the Secretary 's hand . Everybody was a little stunned at Marshall 's plain no on the question of U.S. economic aid . Said a Brazilian next morning : " For me , the conference ended yesterday . "
