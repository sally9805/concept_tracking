I suppose TIME means more to me these dangerous days because so often I know who gathered each item of news and what risks he took to get his knowledge firsthand . So perhaps you too will find TIME more interesting if I show you these paragraphs from four of our correspondents who are sharing the dangers of the war they are reporting . <P> One comes from Harry Zinder , now island-hopping toward the Ruhr with Crerar 's Canadians : <P> " In the gloom of dusk our craft fouled and for more than an hour we crouched in its belly , a perfect target for the Germans . Our little driver asked how far away the enemy was . ' Just over the bank , ' someone replied . ' Which bank do you mean ? ' ' The one right in front of you . ' ' Then let me out quick ! ' the driver yelled , and clambered over the side into two feet of water . ... I felt a lot safer myself after we were moving again . That night we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour the Germans were over us with fast-flying jet aircraft , bombing the daylights out of the whole area . . . " <P> Another comes from Senior Editor Sidney Olson , now at the front as our correspondent with General Simpson 's Ninth Army in Germany . Just before the big push across the Roer he cabled : <P> " Yesterday I flew over Dren by mistake ; I knew we were on the wrong side of the river , but the pilot thought I was mistaken and looped down until we could see figures scurrying around the houses . Buildings were burning and shells were dropping steadily all over the place . Suddenly shots began to crackle all around the plane , and then came a blast of ack-ack . My pilot ducked full speed , maneuvering like a man dancing on hot coals ... " <P> A third comes from Bill Gray , sent just before the last Japs in Manila were killed . It was datelined " a military observation post beside Manila 's Pasig River " : <P> " Shrapnel hits our building and we duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust rise like thunderheads and slowly thin away . <P> Our dusty , tired men move forward a few hundred yards through sickening ruins . But ahead the wall of Intramuros still stands . . . . This is perhaps the strangest battle of modern times . <P> Neither Madrid nor Stalingrad nor Cassino had the elements of this fantastic fight for Intramuros . . . " And still another comes from Bob Sherrod , veteran of New Guinea and Attu , of Tarawa and Saipan , who landed with the Marines on Iwo Jima : " Shortly before we hit the beach three mortar shells dropped in the water beyond us , but the Higgins boat crunched on the shore and without even getting our feet wet we ran up the steep beach and started digging in . ... That first night can only be described as a nightmare in hell . The Japs rained heavy mortars and rockets and artillery on the entire area , and the beach was weird with the yellow-light of star shells and the red flash of mortars that fell all around us . ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my surroundings ( as I had not been able to do when digging a foxhole was the most important thing on earth ) . In a shellhole ten yards away there were eight dead marines . On the other side were two unexploded Jap mines . . . . "
