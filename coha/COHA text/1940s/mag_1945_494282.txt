The Forgotten Man in Washington by John Perry SENATOR BYRD : Do you think that government can ever compete with industry in paying wages ? MR . FLEMMING ( Civil Service Commissioner ) : Not a chance in the world . ? From the hearings on the federal pay bill , S. 1415 . T HE PUBLIC TROUGH is an overrated feeding station . Seldom liberal with his rations , Uncle Sam has been getting stingier since 1941 . The Senate a few days ago passed a bill to increase the pay of federal white-collar employees by an estimated total of about $200 million ; it remains to be seen whether the House will agree , and also , what the net effect will be . Employees in the lowest brackets would get a reasonable increase , and executives , who are assumed to be Administration henchmen , a trifling amount . The John Perry , who during the war was special assistant to th4 D:rector of Foreign Agricultural Relations and Acting Chief of the Food Branch of the Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation 0 perrtions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Administration undoubtedly hoped for much more , but in its current atmosphere of defeatism , it may decide that this is better than nothing . A popular notion shared by some legislators and government officials is that " government " means " Washington " and that a $2,902-a-year clerk-typist is about the lowest-paid civil servant . Actually there are more government workers in both California and New York than in the District of Columbia , and the clerk-typist is about the average in pay . A million and a half federal employees earn less , and a good many of them are the heads of families . This clerk-typist was earning $1,620 when war broke out , and she got no increase in pay scale during the war years . Her work-week stretched out from 39 to 48 hours , and overtime pay ( not compensated at time-and-a-half ) brought her gross earnings to $1,970 . By the middle of 1945 , when Congress decided to give her a raise , overtime was cut back . Five percent of her salary is automatically deducted for the retirement fund . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $277 . Net cash income : $1,563 , only $8r above prewar . If you calculate her real wages on the basis of the CIO 's cost-of-living index , she has actually taken a cut of 29 percent . Another popular notion is that government workers obtained fantastic promotions during the war , leaping from $r , 62o to $3,8o0 , or from $2,000 to $6,228 . It 's true that many civil servants did enjoy their first real chance to move up the ladder , but there was no general scaling-up of federal positions . And the individuals who benefited are now tumbling down again , returning from war agencies to their old jobs at their former pay . More typical was the plight of a group of WPB clerks hired at the lowest clerical grade . Because government could n't compete in the job market , there was little hope of filling vacancies in that group . So they were frozen , forbidden to transfer to better-pay- ing positions , refused promotions and threatened with severe penalties should they resign . UT ' ' ? , STAGES are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civil service ? It 's true that government workers are entitled to liberal vacations and fairly adequate sick-leave . There is a retirement system , though the employee pays five percent of his earnings into the fund . But that is about the limit of the material advantages . Most major corporations enable their workers to buy low-cost group life insurance . Not the government . The government 's health program would shame a self-respecting corporation , and there is no health insurance . Security of tenure is a popular myth ; a job is no more certain than the next appropriation or the shape of the next reorganization . The American civil service , unlike the British , places no insuperable obstacles in the path of the ambitious employee . He can climb as far as he is able , and in many occupations experience rates as heavily as education . But in two major aspects the American system is inferior : there is no general policy of promotion from within ; opportunity is a mixture of merit , seniority , favoritism , politics and happenstance . And government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's workers can organize if they choose , but ( unless they work for the TVA ) they have no bargaining rights . There has been much talk of late about the civil service . Britain 's Labor government is proposing to revamp the whole British structure , and some congressmen would like to do the same with ours . A first step is the bill proposed by Senator Downey , which would step up the federal pay-scale by a flat 20 percent . This is n't a measure to increase real wages , but merely a long overdue attempt to bring federal wages approximately into line with industry 's . The bill is supported by the President , most of the Cabinet and the Civil Service Commission , and it came to the Senate floor with the support of the Senate Civil Service Committee . But in the two weeks it was under consideration , Senators Byrd , Taft and Hickenlooper , with plenty of help from the sidelines , kept it from coming to a vote , with the results noted in my first paragraph . Downey , fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little had to give ground . He was forced to withdraw amendments intended to attack a second major problem of the federal service : keeping the top jobs filled with able men . Government 's top salary in the merit system , $8,750 , is so far below what industry pays that there is now a mass exodus from public service . The top men are leaving . Thurman Arnold , Bob Ramspeck and Happy Chandler head a parade of Washington figures who have quit government to earn a living . Oscar Gass , Lauchlin Currie , Joe Weiner , Bob Nathan , Wayne Coy , Ken Galbraith , Leon Henderson , John Fischer , Randolph Paul and Daniel Bell are but a few of those who have found private employment more lucrative . ( Some of them , of course , have had other reasons , including discouragement over the present trend of the national government . ) Senator Taft sneers that many $5,00o government officials could n't earn $1,500 in private industry . But the Truman administration is worried by the loss of its best brains . Government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national crisis . Then there is powerful magnetism in public service , in having a part in shaping great events . Roosevelt brought in one group of brilliant young men during the New Deal and a much larger , though less cohesive , blue-ribbon group to win the war . But such men , responding to an emergency , will seldom adopt government as a career . One year , five , even ten , they can charge off to experience . But when the emergency is over , when federal policy loses its incisiveness , when action is supplanted by frustration , they leave . Not until some new administration offers again a bold , constructive program will others tike their places . t ? -r HERE ARE notable and honorable exceptions . The .1 world 's leading designer of dams has been a public servant for 34 years . His engineering fees in private practice would probably have approximated $5 million . Uncle Sam has paid him less than a twentieth of that . A government purchasing agent buying $100 million worth of commodities is paid one-fifth as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the public rolls are world-famous chemists , biologists , cartographers , mathematicians and executives , most of them serving at some personal sacrifice . But they are exceptions and the nation can scarcely depend on sacrifice as a principle of government . The nation pays a price for niggardliness . Too often it places great responsibilities in the hands of second and third-rate men . But it pays a penalty even in times when the services of most men can be commanded . For government is a profession in itself , not readily grasped by the newcomer , whatever his talents . It is true that many New Dealers were gifted amateurs , and equally true that many wartime bungles were due more to inexperience than to red tape . It is as if the top staff of General Motors were periodically replaced by a group of men highly trained in their own professions but unaccustomed to working with one another and unfamiliar with the automobile industry . Senator Downey 's amendments were not lavish , but they would have opened up many more career possibilities in government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , lifting the ceiling from $8,750 to $15,000 . Cabinet members would have moved up to $20,000 and some of their aides to $15,000 . Other executive posts , positions in the judiciary and members of boards and commissions would have received similar increases . Representatives would have been stepped up to $15,000 and received an additional $2,500 for office expense . A novel amendment would have given each Senator a $9,000 assistant . These provisions were supported by the Adminis895 tration as well as the Civil Service Commission . But despite public-opinion polls showing emphatic popular support for higher congressional wages , Senators in the main still believe that voting themselves a pay increase is politically fatal . And it was apparent that if they would not raise their own wages , they would n't vote to lift others above their own level . The amendments were scuttled in short order . What remains is the basic fight on a straight costof-living increase to federal workers . The opposition , of course , does n't talk about it that way . The opponents tell stories about federal inefficiency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attaches to a job , not a man , and that if a. poorly qualified man is in the job , the fault is with placement procedure , not with the pay-scale . Downey makes another telling point . Federal workers , he says , are the only major group of American workers who have not had cost-of-living pay increases during the war . Every major strike that has been settled recently has awarded the strikers more than is provided by the Downey bill . Of all major groups of employees , civil servants alone do not have the right to strike . The lesson is obvious .
