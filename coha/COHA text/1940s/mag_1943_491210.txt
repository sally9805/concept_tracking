A FIGHTING fleet is like an aristocratic family of spinster daughters . It has its big-bosomed , flashing girls ; its swift , tart ones ; its proud ones whose ankles and spirit have thickened a bit with the years , and they , of course , must be the battleships . In the family m  --  nage are the lowly , the serving ones , the ugly ducklings . They are the supply ships , the repair ships , the hospital hulls and the transports . None of the caste and glamour of the daughters of the line belongs to them . They do their vital work and retire , away from the cameras and the bands . But like all those who quietly toil and serve , they have their passions , too , and their despair and their joy ; and death , usually quite unmarked , finds them in the end . This is the story of one of them and how she died in the Coral Sea . She was the U.S.S. Neosho , an auxiliary oiler attached to the Pacific fleet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand tons and had a steady eighteen-knots cruising speed . Tankerlike , her life was in two places  --  in the stern with her engines , and amidships in and around her bridge . Between and below , she was an uninhabitable reservoir of fuel tanks that could carry 150,000 barrels . Her duty was to suckle fighting ships with gasoline and oil , She nursed them in port if fate was kind ; if not , she fueled them at sea . She would heave alongside , rig her bumpers and slide out her great rubber hoses , one forward , one aft . Towing her charge , now helpless , with engines idling , her powerful pumps would sluice the contents of her tanks into bellies that could digest them and use their energy in battle . Once this was done , she hurried back to the nearest source of supply ; San Pedro in peace , and Pearl Harbor in war . She was without armor , without any great aMount of armament . Her master was Capt . John S. Phillips , a Virginian of the class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight-spined and commanding , with blue eyes set deep in nests of fine lines etched there by humor rather than time . His executive was Lt. Comdr . Francis J. Firth , from New England , also an Academy man , class of ' 21 .. Fritz  --  as the wardroom knew him  --  is thin-lipped and keen-eyed , shorter than his skipper , but tough as they come . Tom Brown was the ship 's gunnery officer , a two and a half striper who knew his guns . She had an engineer lieutenant named Verbrugge who could move like a cat despite his 200 pounds . She also had a chief water tender who walked open-eyed into death so that his ship might live . She had , to lump them all together , eighteen officers , thirty hard-boiled C.P.O. 's and 230 ratings , some green and some seasoned , when she closed with Diamond Head , island of Oahu , on the morning of December sixth and slid into harbor at Hickam Field . She pumped 500,000 gallons of octane gasoline into Hickam 's tanks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor to Ford Island . All that night her pumps were going , sluicing another half million gallons into the Navy shore tanks there . At ' 1:55 on the morning of December seventh , a crystal-clear morning of sabbatical quiet , Captain Phillips was taking a stroll on deck . A plane droned overhead , and then its drone crescendoed as it went into a power dive . Have our Navy fliers gone completely nuts ? " he marveled to one of his officers near by . " Practicing dive bombing over a live target before eight o'clock on Sunday morning ? " OPPCIAL U S. NAVY PHOTO The plane came out of its dive . On the underside of its wings , as it slanted upward , gleamed the sullen red sun of Japan . Phillips ' crew was at hand . " General quarters " brought them quickly to station . The Neosho 's four small 3-inch twenty-threes set their fuses for dive-bomber range , and one of them may easily have been the gun that fired the first feeble upward shot against all the treacherous hail that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the battleship Oklahoma rolled heavily on her side . Men swarmed over her like bees , plunging into the oil-clogged sea , swimming for shore , for dinghies , for ships , for anything that offered sanctuary . At 8:05 , the Oklahoma sank . At 8:15 , the Arizona , three battleships down the jetty , blew up and burst into flames . At 8:25 , the Neosho 's engine room was ready to get her away . As there was no one on Ford Island to cast off lines , Captain Phillips ordered them cut at the rail with axes . Slowly , hacking away to clear the dead Oklahoma , passing the Tennessee and West Virginia , and close enough to feel the heat of the flaming Arizona , he carried sternway . Then the engine-room telegraphs rang to " Full ahead ! " and the big gray oiler threaded her way across the splashing , watery hell of Pearl Harbor . Bomb racks straddled her . Torpedo wakes were white trails in the Wedgwood-blue water . Sparks and cordite reek drifted in wraiths , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh again . Twisting and dodging , but never slowing down , Phillips reached Merry Point and brought up there without having lost a man or a bit of paint . He wears a Navy Cross to help him remember it . Then followed a period for which the Neosho had been saved . There was no other fleet oiler in the mid-Pacific when the American Navy , stunned by the blow from Japan , gathered its remaining strength . Task Force No. 1 , its ensigns whipping straight out from the gaffs , cleared for sea . The Neosho was with it . For five months she fueled fighting ships all over the Pacific  --  the Lexington , the Astoria , the Hammann , the Jarvis , the Sims , the Yorktown . There was a short breathing space when she was hurried off to the States for guns . She took one fat 5-incher , three brand-new 3-inch 50 's , and eight of the 20-mm. quick-firing machine guns , screwed them to her deck and hurried westward to resume duty . Her journeys to the islands and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made them alone , for an escort could not be spared to protect an oiler then . She waddled.about on the fringes of disaster , doing her wet-nurse 's tasks and taking the kidding of the men who lined the rails of the real fighting ships and called her their " Fat Girl , " their " floating gas station . " On the seventh of May she had a rendezvous some 450 miles off the coast of Australia with a big task force . The time was early in the morning . She got there and cruised slowly on a prearranged course , waiting for daylight . With her , for a change , was an escort . The destroyer Sims , one of the new 400 's , cutting the water 1000 yards off her bow , looked lean and comforting in the dawn 's early light . The light disclosed a vast expanse of Pacific Ocean . The task force was not in it . General Quarters P HILLIPS and the Neosho 's communications officer had a good hunch why . They kept quiet about it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific  --  had reported a Japanese force near by . Somewhere not far away , the battle of the Coral Sea was slowly closing . At eight o'clock , Captain Phillips sighted two planes . They remained black specks for a few moments , then vanished . What were they ? Friends ? At 9:30 , without a sound , a lazy geyser of snow-white water lifted and hung against the blue sky . It hung midway between the Neosho and the Sims while a delayed-action bomb softly thudded . A Jap near miss . All hands , their upturned faces grim , searched aloft to see what was hiding in the clouds . Finally , very high , they sighted the enemy  --  a single-engine bomber winging rapidly northward . A southeaster began to pipe up and Neosho 's strident bells for " general quarters " blended with its whine through her rigging . She came about and headed northwestward . The Sims , slapping spray across her weather bow , closed on the starboard bow and the two lonely ships drove off at eighteen knots , all the knots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that pair would have been to bury one 's face in his hands in despair . Southward lay a Japanese carrier force launching dive bombers and two-engined , high-level bombers . Northwestward over the turn of the watery globe was an American and Australian cruiser and carrier fleet . In between , crawling slowly along , the Neosho and the Sims stood directly in the course that connected the two great flotillas . At ten o'clock the first of the Japanese dive-bomber fleet went over , flying high in echelon . The Sims and the Neosho spat their puny fire at them . It was half a mile short . The planes went on . Thirty-five minutes later an echelon of twelve two-motored bombers appeared . The after three planes broke for-/nation and closed , tight , bow to stern . Each plane at I the same instant dropped a single bomb . Still together , they rejoined their mates ahead . Phillips , watching the fall of the bombs , managed to put them into the water twenty-five yards alongside . No harm was done to hull or gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs from the intense vibration . For an hour and twenty-five minutes more the Japanese air squadrons cruised disdainfully by . On the Neosho the gun crews dipped their spoons into canisters of hot stew , watching the sky as they chewed . Soon a flight of twenty-four dive bombers lifted the southern horizon , no bigger than flies . They moved up the sky and the gunners ' eyes followed them . There was a single shout , a clatter of spoons dropping into the monel canisters . Then the whole ship filled with whooping and shrills of release from tension , and the rattle of 20-mm. magazines settling on steel decks , The guns made no noise as their greased pinions turned , swinging their lean , expectant snouts . Out of a moment 's lull came a raucous monologue from a coxswain at a gun . " Oh , come , come , come in and see the Fat Lady ! " he intoned as if barking for a side show . " See her quit/-v-ver as she laughs ! The Neosho gave a sudden thirty-degree list to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all over  --  or so the enemy thought . At 12:18 , the Japanese squadron flew off to join the rest of their attacking force somewhere to the northeastward . Their loss had been but three planes shot down and surely killed , and four more crippled . A small price , the squadron leader must have exulted , for what he was leaving behind  --  an oil slick floating with the wreckage of a destroyer , and the burning , shattered , capsizing hulk of a big fleet oiler , doomed with all her men . But those men were not shattered , not all of them . Little Firth opened his eyes . He had been knocked unconscious as he stood his post . The whole stack deck about him was in flames . He started through the smoke , which he thought was steam , he says , holding his breath . " Is that you , commander ? " asked a young seaman . " Yes , " he said , it is . " " Have you noticed , sir , your life jacket is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Firth said . " Then why the hell do n't you put it out ? " The seaman grabbed him by the smoldering kapok jacket and helped him down the ladder to the main deck . " You go now to the captain , " commanded Firth . " Tell him I 'm here on station . Ask him what he intends to do about abandoning ship . " He waited , holding on to the port rail , half losing consciousness as the sick ship " Sir , " he reported , " the captain says hang on awhile . " " Very well , " said Firth . He staggered off to find out what made his face and left arm so numb . The chief pharmacist 's mate did n't tell him he had been burned to the bone . " Been scorched a bit , sir , " he said , " by that Jap gasoline . " The pharmacist 's mate had one of the big Navy tubes of tannic acid and he smeared it over the officer 's face and arms . Firth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleeves of his shirt . They had been burned off to the shoulder . He did not feel the needle going in with the morphine . The Call of Duty Oscar Vernon Peterson , the Neosho 's chief water tender , was a middle-aged married man , happy in the Navy , content to live and die in it . His station in " general quarters " was in charge of a repair party waiting in the crew 's mess compartment alongside the upper level of the fireroom . He had , as a standing specific duty , the job of closing the four main-steam-line stop valves during battle , should damage indicate the need . When the Japanese bomb exploded in the fireroom , it indicated such a need to Peterson . It indicated this by blowing open the iron door and demolishing the bulkhead that separated his party from the fireroom , seriously injuring all his men , knocking him down and burning his face and hands . He worked his way into the fireroom trunk over the forward end of the boilers . He lay there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steam , rushing out at 400 pounds pressure and 750 degrees of superheat , had dissipated enough to let him reach the valves without dying on the way . He went on then and closed all four of them . He surprised himself by not only getting in without dying but by getting out as well . When he reached the open air , the skin on his hands , not waiting to blister normally , sloughed off at once , like the leather in the fingers of a halfpulled-on suede glove . It took him six days to die . There was enough morphine for six days . Directly beneath the fireroom was the after engine room . Harold Bratt , machinist 's mate , first class , was in charge of its watch and battle station . With him stood four men . The only escape from here was up a vertical steel ladder through the fireroom deck and then out through the hatches . When the fireroom blew up right above them , Bratt picked himself up in the sudden darkness , flicked on his flashlight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd taken . They 'd gone clean through her decks and exploded thirty feet below . Whole stretches of her bilge strakes were blown outward . The tide was rising and falling in her . Tom Brown , the gunnery officer , was down the bridge wing , and Captain Phillips joined him there . He stared where Brown was staring , down into the sea . It was rippling with big fish , carnivores of some sort . There was blood in the scuppers , there had been dead men in the sea and the fish were hoping for more . The two men were very close . Phillips ' command and Brown 's answering " Aye , aye , sir ! " had always been by word of mouth , for Brown 's station on the flying bridge was within easy speaking distance of the captain 's bridge below . " Brownie , " Phillips said , nodding at the water , " if that 's where I 've got to wind up , I 'm going to take a last deep breath , blow it all out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give those little chums down there a long slow time with me . It 's been fine serving with you , Brownie . You 're a grand fellow . " " It 's been fine serving with you , " said Brown . They stared out over the sea , where the four rafts were now distant specks on the horizon . Soon the gray Pacific distance would swallow them , sixty-eight men on rafts that could have floated a hundred . Out there , although Phillips could not see him , was Tucker . Tucker had signed on as an embalmer with a rating of pharmacist 's mate , third class , but he specialized , the men left will tell you , in dishing out tall tales . Tucker was always good for a laugh . He was good for other things , too , though his shipmates were n't to know it until they 'd ducked the flames to leap into the sea . Tucker had gone over with a first-aid kit in his teeth . How he happened to have it , no one knows , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming with it from raft to raft , patching up men who sat stolidly sweating out their pain . He was unseasoned and slight , so his arms gave out long before his heart . Half a dozen times men shouted , " Take it easy , fellah ! " and tried to haul him aboard . Each time he broke away . The last time to disappear under a wave . Phillips watched his two whaleboats returning from their last trip to windward . He had ordered them to collect the worst wounded out there . Another motor whaler was coming up . She seemed to he holed near the water line . She must be the Sims ' boat . She had a handful of men in her , all that had been saved out of a whole destroyer 's list . She could take on some of his men . His own men , Phillips saw , were following orders , salvaging anything that would float them . They were dragging mess tables and benches , ammunition boxes and fenders , and securing them , ready to float @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped halfway , for he knew he had only half enough small boats to save them . How could he decide who should go in the boats and who should stay and die hanging to a plank in this world of wave and night and thirst and sharks ? The sick bay un the midship deck was furming . The party that had gone into the wrecked quarters fore and aft was spreading mattresses and blankets , and the wounded were moving up on stretchers . Another party under the bos'n was rigging hand lines , so men could move along the slanted , oily deck ( Continued on Page 39 ) O NE shining exception to the ONE old rule that nothing can be invented and perfected at the same time is the rain check , which sprang full-panoplied from the aching brow of one Abner Powell , who today is perhaps the oldest living baseball player . Almost any pleasant Sunday morning at City Park in New Orleans you may see him , at eighty-two , actively captaining a team composed of himself , his grandsons and their young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Powell got into baseball by way of the coal mines , where , as a mule driver , he is reputed to have developed astounding speed and accuracy pegging monitory chunks of anthracite at his steeds . Powell switched to chucking baseballs with Pottsville , of the Anthracite League , Providence , of the National League , and Chicago , of the outlaw Union League , ultimately reaching the top as one of the immortal Baltimore Orioles . But he had wit enough to know that he would never be a truly great pitcher . Therefore , with his modest savings for a springboard , he persuaded a New Orleans traction magnate , Isidore Newman , to become his partner in purchasing the Pelicans . The year was 1888 , and New Orleans was a tough baseball prospect . The worst managerial headache was wet grounds . In New Orleans one walks uphill to the river . The levees which ringed the city to keep flood water out likewise kept rain water in . The impeller pumps which now dispose of it had not yet been invented , and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever-recurrent daymare . Baseball everywhere then used what was known as the " stiff ticket , " a heavy cardboard rectangle which could be sold over and over again . Purchasers surrendered it to the gatekeeper , and , after the evening 's check of receipts , it was put back into the box office to he sold again . In the event of rain before completion of the fifth inning , each spectator received one of these tickets back as he filed out of the gate , so that he still had an admission card to a full ball game . The number of tickets thus called for was invariably much larger than the number previously deposited at the turnstiles by incoming patrons . Boys who had infiltrated the grounds via unguarded sections of fence , employees who had come in by the service entrance , politicos and others who had been admitted by the pass gate , all walked out by the pay gate and received a ticket which they could later sell if they did not use it themselves . The same situation obtained in every ball park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans was the frequency of afternoon showers during the first hot weeks of early summer . Something had to be done . From the throbbing brow of Ab Powell burst the idea of a ticket with a detachable stub , the latter  --  retained by the holder on entering good for one additional admission if rain halted play before the fifth inning . The Arkansas printing firm which made up these tickets to his specifications was soon deluged by requests from other ball clubs for similar tickets . Powell might have become a millionaire by patenting his device , but was so well satisfied with his success in putting the Pels on a paying basis at last that no additional exploitation of his idea occurred to him . ? HERMANN B. DEUTSCH . ( Continued from Page 37 ) and not fall into the breaking seas . Forward , the third party was trying to cut through the starboard anchor chain with hack saws and let the eight-ton weight of the big hook , with its twenty-five tons of chain , drop away . Its release would help the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was burning itself out . He could see the skeleton of the Jar ) plaile sticking over the stack deck . He wondered what had become of the little Jap himself . Perhaps the men had put his body with their own dead comrades . It was hard to think of his ship as something not to be trusted . She looked , she felt under his feet , as if she were dying . The ensign was clean and fresh in the twilight , whipping merrily at its halyard . The flag and his dead . He wondered if he should bury his dead and run down the ensign and save it . No . Let her carry both of them into the night , go down if she must with her colors flying and be a coffin for her own dead . A radio rating came up . " Chief Parker reports that he is sending our position in clear every five minutes , sir , and that there is no acknowledgment . " " Very well . Tell him to stop for a while , " Phillips said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the doctor , Brownie ? " " No , sir . He was last seen on the stack deck . He 's gone . " " We could use him , poor fellow . " Captain Phillips paused . " Brownie , when those whalers get alongside , I want the wounded loaded into them . I 'm going to get them off this ship for the night . Put aboard a skeleton crew for watch and watch at the tillers and the engines , and a hand or two for bailing . Have them lay off about a hundred yards . Keep us in sight all night . No flashlights . No signaling . " He walked down from the bridge and out on the main deck . He wondered where Firth , his executive , was . With his face a mask of charred skin and tannic salve , Firth sat propped against a bulwark . " My God , Frankie , is this you ? " The executive struggled to his feet . He raised his right hand , swollen to terrible size , in an ungainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain ? " he asked . Phillips turned away , so that Firth , squinting out of slits that had once been eyes , could not see how close he was to crying . " Get into one of the boats tonight , Frankie , " he commanded . " I 'm counting on you to take charge of a batch of wounded . Meanwhile , get off your feet . " The Soul of a Ship After the wounded  --  twenty-six of them had to be lowered over the side  --  were bedded in the boats , Phillips went back to his bridge . " No change ? " he asked of the quartermaster on inclinometer watch . " No , sir . Still thirty-degree list . She 's rolling thirty-two degrees . " Phillips watched the brass-arrow pendulum swing through its arc , depicting the uneven contortions of the Neosho 's groaning , gutted-out body . The way she would finish would be to increase that unevenness . Down to starboard , a little lower , lower still , then she would hang for a moment . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . It was dark now and his men , heads under the rail and legs down the incline of the deck , were asleep . By force of habit he glanced up for the lookout on the flying bridge , then remembered he had stopped that routine . Bracing himself in a corner , he settled down with knees locked in arms and stared out over the inscrutable black sea . At intervals he could hear the emergency gasoline-motor generator , the only mechanically intact thing in the whole ship . The little generator started up , then came the staccato whine of open code going out : " Neosho . Latitude and longitude . We are sinking . " Friend or enemy  --  someone should hear it , if they were not too busy . The sound of the whaleboat engines came and went as they cruised with their suffering freight . The blackout torches he had given the pharmacist 's mates winked on and moved about . They sketched a morphine pantomime , he guessed , against the backdrop of dark , tossing sea . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far off he sensed the battle , though he could see no fires or red glow . Once he thought he caught the flicker of big-gun lightning low in the northeast ; he cocked his ear for the distant rumble of a broadside , but it did not come . A quartermaster stood over him , a different one , and he realized that the four-to-eight watch must be on duty . " Yes , " he said , " I am awake . " " The list has improved , sir , " the quartermaster said . " It has moved up to twenty-five degrees  --  between twenty-five and twenty-seven is the midpoint now , sir . " Captain Phillips came to his feet . " Something has torn loose inside her , " he said . " She 's trying to help herself . Up to twenty-five degrees , you say ? " " Yes , sir . " " Very well . " He did not need to go onto the bridge to see that it was true . He could see it down the deck . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fore and aft , afraid that she had only robbed Peter to pay Paul and was down by the head or the stern . Instead , he saw that she was still even on her fore-and-aft trim . " Old Fat Lady , " he blessed her , " you still want to carry for me , do n't you ? " A surge of hope spurred his heart . He thought of the task he had planned for daylight , and knew the odds against it had bettered . Time ! The Neosho was trying to give him a little time . The task was the forty-foot motor sailer jammed in its chocks on the port side of the catwalk . It weighed eight tons and , without power , he was going to set it over the side into the sea . It would hold fifty men , sixty if they squeezed tightly . With that much carry added to the three whalers , they could all make Australia  --  or at least make a start for Australia . The emergency generator throbbed again . The signal in clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are sinking . " He walked to the radio shack . There was a twilight there from the dials , warm with cigarette smoke . " Belay that , " he said . " Get some sleep . They 're fighting all over the Coral Sea tonight . Try it later in the morning and say " He reached for the dog-eared paper holding his first message and crossed out , " We are sinking , " and wrote , " Preparing to abandon ship , " then added his initials , " J. P. , " to make it official . The name of Louis Verbrugge dominates every story of how the Neosho launched her motor sailer . He was her engineer lieutenant , a real hunk of a man , five feet eleven and well over 200 pounds in weight . During the attack he was at his station in the main engine room , and the second hit tried hard to drive him out . Among other things , it flooded the place with fuel oil . The oil caught fire and the smoke was so dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed at this time as untenable . But Ver brugge proved a stubborn tenant . He knew that the fire must smother itself , which it shortly did , and that the oil would drain down the shaft alleys , which also happened . So he stayed and the Neosho 's engines did not fail until the fireroom was demolished . After the attack he still stood his post , and when he came on deck he had a comprehensive report of the damage sustained by his department . He had coolly made an official inspection with an emergency torch without even coming up to see how the thirty-degree list looked from topside . When Phillips talks about him his voice fills with wonder . Toilers of the Sea " He knew those engines would probably never run again , " the captain marvels , " yet he had a complete report for me . Little penciled notes . " Phillips gave Verbrugge and Lieutenant Bradford the job of putting the motor sailer over the side . In no sense of the word could it be called a launching . Stevedoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word ; for , with combers running up the big oiler 's tilted deck , there could be no launching of anything downhill . Instead , the motor sailer had to go uphill and out over the high side . Under normal conditions the craft 's eight tons sat evenly in the chocks ; with power winches winding in cable , the booms could pick it up , swing it outboard and then lower it into the sea . Because of the steep list , however , the weight was jammed down on the lower side of the chocks . The booms could not lift it straight up , but must pull it out at an angle ; for , once free , it was going to swing inboard with a sudden crunching jerk . That much accomplished , the booms must be turned outboard with eight tons of tender wooden hull suspended , not over the sea but over the Neosho 's steel side . It must be slid down that heaving skidway , rubbing against it , wanting to bounce away and come crashing back . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart letting go and smart getting away in the interval between two seas , lest the big hull roll under the smaller one . The task , in short , was tremendous , for the Neosho was completely without power . Chain hoists , block and tackle and the strength of her sick men were all she had . At the crack of dawn Phillips sounded his own reveille . " Come on ! " he yelled , hauling himself along the life line past the sleeping men . " Rise and shine , you boys ! Work to do ! " They had a breakfast of canned fruit juice and cold canned beans and by that time dawn was over them . The lesser wounded and the men who had died in the boat during the night were brought back aboard . The bad cases stayed in the boats tailed out astern on a long painter . The pharmacist 's mates , sleepless , tireless , went out to them every hour . On deck a muster showed sixty-four hands more or less fit for duty when Verbrugge assembled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manila line , strong two and three way blocks , bumper material galore , shoring timber and axes and pry bars . They worked from dawn to dark , a total of sixteen hours . The list stayed at twenty-five degrees . The wind was still southeast . The sea was big but regular . Phillips made a series of ranging sights on stanchions and sparswhere ( Continued on Pope 41 ) ( Continued from Page 39 ) he could sight at different angles against the horizon and watch the Neosho 's slow sinking . " Shewas trying to give me time , ' he says when he speaks of her . " Those sights would be down just a shade every watch . She was hanging on , I tell you . " He decided to bury his dead . No one ' could find the ship 's Bible . The last seen of it had been in the doctor 's office aft by the sick bay , and fire had swept that place . " Hoag , " Phillips asked the chief pharmacist 's mate , " will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what these men all are . I 'm a Catholic . You 're not . Will you make up a prayer and say it over this burial ? " The little Jap was not among the bodies that went overside . " Oh , him , " a quartermaster told the captain , " he 's still up there , sir . The boys go up and take a look at him once in a while . Mr. So-Sorry , they call him . Sort of a mascot , he is . " Outcast From the Sky Phillips climbed the heat-warped ladder to the stack deck . There inside the No. 4 gun apron was Mr. So-Sorry , propped against the gun base . He was scarcely bigger than a cast-off doll that had been rescued by some urchin from a dump fire . Phillips swears he could not have been more than four and a half feet tall in life , and he was somewhat smaller now . Burned to a crisp , his skull was grinning apologetically . Phillips walked away and gave no order that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of its skid , and Verbrugge hitched up his pants in satisfaction as he regarded it , He had taken the last hour before dark to stay and truss it a dozen ways , lest it swing too wildly and bang against the booms . A watch was set over it for the night . Supper was more cold food out of cans . There was a choice of ham , wieners , corned beef or fruit . The fruit juice , to everyone 's disgust , was gone . A Filipino mess boy named Leopoldo Paloma was jocund at the feast and tried to break the news of no juice gently . " We halve pineapples in jluice , " he intoned in a high Oriental voice . " We halve glape fluit in jluice . We have peachy-peachy in jluice , but no jluice . No jluice , please . " It covered the ship , that senseless singsong , and lived for many days . The whaleboats were hauled alongside again and the wounded lowered into them for another night away from the dying Neosho . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Might as well , sir . I 'm blind as a bat . I 'm no good here . " " Very well . " Firth said he sensed a loneliness in that " Very well . " He asked to be led to Hoag , the chief pharmacist 's mate . " Hoagy , " he said , " take a razor blade and lance these blisters , and we 'll see what's.under them . " Hoag made two slices into the blisters and sopped the water away . Firth blinked his eyes . They had not been harmed . He walked hack to Phillips . " I feel better , " he said . " / guess I 'll stay aboard . How about a little relief and you catch some sleep ? " Phillips did riot want to catch any sleep . He wanted to talk about abandoning ship , start the plans for a trek some 450 miles down wind , up sun , through the Great Barrier Reef to the Australian beach . Brownie joined them and all through that second night they talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true : the Japs would not come back , the Neosho would not go down , Verbrugge would put the motor sailer safely alongside . Then the talk settled down to questions about room in the boats and water and navigation and arms and the wounded and discipline . The motors must come out of the whalers , and the gasoline tanks . Fifteen hundred pounds of buoyancy so saved in each boat could he used by men . Spars for the whalers , small , tough , square sails . The wind for Willis Islets and then on to Trinity Opening in the Great Barrier would be what was blowing on them now ; a southeast wind , the Pacific trades . It would never be more than thirty degrees off the course . It would be a running junket , running full and by . " Brownie , " said Phillips , " you and I will go in the motor sailer with the wounded . We 'll be the only boat with power . We 'll use the motor to round up each morning . There 's to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help it , but we 'll round up everything in the mornings . " " How about guns ? " asked Firth . " Side arms on officers . No guns in the little ships . We 'll have a stack or two of rifles in the big boat . It 's going to be a long hard time . We want no crazy men with guns . " " Discipline ! " said Brownie . " This is where it counts . " " Sun , " Phillips went on , " is going to be our trouble . From zenith on , we 'll be looking right into it . It 's going to be hell on our burned . . . . Frankie , do you suppose you can command a whaler ? " " Yes , sir , " aaid Firth . The Fringes of Battle " We 'll see . Tomorrow we start . Knowles , he used to yacht a tot . He 'll be a good hand at working out the sail plan for the whalers . Stoval , he 'll be useful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of everything .. ? . Brownie , come with me and look over the coast pilot in the chart room . " " Queer we do n't hear anything on the air , " said Brown . " Forget that , " Phillips said . " We ca n't count on it . We 're  --  well , we 're in the Fat Lady on the fringes of a battle , a big battle . Maybe nobody can spare time for us . Maybe they have nothing now to send . " The tog of May eighth , the second day , covers the sixteen hours from dawn to dark in one short paragraph : " Drifting as before . List , twenty-four degrees starboard . Continued treatment of injured and burned . All available hands at launching motor sailer . Sea and wind the same . " It tried to be as cryptic for the next day : " Drifting as before . List twenty-five degrees . Upper deck and starboard side awash . Ship still settling . Motor sailer successfully launched at noon . Continued treatment of burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor sailer with stores . " The official words gave no hint of the wild scene of that launching . They do not tell how Bratt , machinist 's mate , volunteered to swarm out on a chain hoist that had jammed and free it with his small peening hammer , and then run the flying chain hand over hand , like a monkey on a stick , as it whined up and over the sheave with eight tons of dead weight pulling at it . One instant 's miscalculation would have cost him his arms . It does not depict the cheers of the tired men , nor how good that forty feet of beamy boat looked floating , sound and able , on the sea , nor how Verbrugge once more hitched up his wrinkled pants and grinned . But the log goes on ; it was too big a day to hold in one paragraph : " 2:30 P.M. : Sighted plane to starboard . " It was a new plane to them , a double-tailed , two-motor bomber . Their hearts held still while it came on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a red  --  what ? That sun of Japan ? The " general quarters " sirens having died with the dynamos , a ringing of the ship 's bells was now the call to battle stations . The Neosho 's big brass bell clanged madly and her ragged men , slipping and sliding on the tilted deck , ran to man the port guns . The ammunition clattered , the salt-caked gun muzzles swung . This time there was no shouting . They were weary men , too weary to remember to yell , until from the flying bridge came a cry , clear and high , " That 's no Nip ! That 's us ! " It was the voice of a sharp-eyed quartermaster rating . His arm drew large in the air the concentric circles of the Royal Flying Corps . The red was the red bull's-eye of the allies ; the plane was a Lockheed Hudson of the Royal Australian Air Force . It circled overhead and began to blink its searchlight signal lamp : " A-R-E Y-O-U I-N T-R-O-U-B - " Phillips breathed a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could a man look down at such a sight from the sky and ask , " Are you in trouble ? " He nodded to his waiting signalman . " Affirmative , " he said . The lamp using the small current from the radio generator clattered out the word . " Send our position , " Phillips ordered . The lamp spelled out the latitude and longitude . There was no acknowledgment from the plane . We spelled it out again . Then again . The plane , without speaking , circled several times at iow altitude . It disappeared to the southward . The Neosho 's men watched it vanish . Phillips let them stand until it was gone . " Back to work , " he said . " We 'll go on as if nothing had happened . Maybe nothing has . " The log , too , goes on as if nothing had happened , as if that plane in the sky had been a dream : " Continued treatment of injured . Sufficient fresh water . Rationing food under supervision of assistant supply officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats , due consideration being given to distribution of able-bodied men and injured and burned . After end of ship has settled appreciably in past twenty-four hours . " But that evening there was hot coffee . Worrel , the chief electrician 's mate , asked permission to hook the radio generator to two hot plates and , starting in midafternoon , the cooks had plenty of Java steaming for all hands by suppertime . It was the first hot food since the bitter stew at noon on the day of the attack . And after dark , under the main-deck rail , there was a low hum of conversation , of laughter now and then . Hope was strong in the air . The log for the tenth begins : " Drifting as before . List twenty-four degrees . The commanding officer held a conference of all officers , made final assignments and gave final instructions in regard to contemplated departure for Australia . " 11 : 30 A.M. : A plane sighted to eastward . Identified as a PBY . Circled ship twice and disappeared southward . " 1:00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a destroyer , sir , " said Brown . " Yes , " said Phillips under his binoculars . " What do you make her to be ? " " She might be  --  either , sir . " " Sound general quarters ! " The two officers held their glasses on the slim gray shape as it pitched into the head sea . The alarm bell clanged and men hurried past them to the guns . Finally , Phillips put down his glass . " Secure , " he said . " That 's our ensign . That 's one of our Four Hundreds . . . . Signalman . " " Yes , sir . " " Say , ' Believe Neosho in immediate danger capsizing . What instructions ? " ' The signal lamp clucked swiftly , then waited . " No instructions , " the white light on the destroyer said . " Say , ' Lay off one hundred yards . Will come to you . ' . . . Brownie , " Phillips announced , " every man has five minutes to get his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor even more beautiful . The ensign 's ears were as red as if he had been the kissed and not the kisser . Slowly he released her . The uncertain pause was broken by the first roar of the lieutenant as he shot off the porch . He was moving fast . " Why ! " said Janice . Her eyes darted accusingly at the ensign . " You are n't " ? for a small moment she could not invent a name ? " you are n't Tom . . . Tucker at all ! You are n't ! You 'd better go ! " She turned an indignant back on him . Claire , too , recoiled from him . It was his move . John Appleyard was wrestling with the gate . Quickly , Janice leaned toward Claire . " Remember ! " she breathed . " It was n't a mistake . He 's just an old buddy of yours  --  that sort of thing . String John along if you want to he happy ! " She turned hack to the ensign . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ! " she said indignantly . " Really ! " The ensign did n't move . He seemed to be thinking . His brown eyes studied her . John Appleyard blustered up . " What 's the idea of kissing my wife on a public street ? " he demanded . " Who are you ? What does this mean ? " Fascinated , Janice stared at the ensign 's face . You could almost see him think . Little lines developed at the corners of his eyes . His forehead was only slightly puckered . His mouth remained closed , with lips tight . " I asked you what you meant by kissing my wife on a public street ! " John Appleyard repeated . Janice knew the ensign was framing the crushing reply  --  that no other spot was available . But it did n't come . He continued to stand there , motionless . His hands , which had clenched automatically into fists at Appleyard 's belligerent approach , relaxed again . This ensign knew that words would n't sailer . Tow one of the whalers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infested skies and waters a moment more than we must . " Phillips ' room was a shambles . There was broken glass wherever he looked . Miraculously , none of it came from his wife 's picture , which was still on the dresser with the Saint Christopher medal still dangling from it . He wrapped the picture in the first uniform he laid hands on  --  his oldest , he discovered later . Taking a last look , he saw his sword standing in the corner . But his sword should go down with his ship . He worked his way back to the door and topside . Again the log : " 1:40 P.M. : The commanding officer of the Neosho left his ship , having transferred to the U.S.S. Henley a total of 123 officers and enlisted personnel . " 2:22 P.M. : The Neosho was , upon orders , sunk by " " My God , " cried Phillips on the Henley 's bridge , " hit her astern , I tell you ! Do n't torture her like that ! " " Yes , captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get her down for you . " " Just get her under ? get her under for me . " She was going , the Fat Lady . She put her how down and slowly slid after it until her stack vanished , and then , last of all , the spar with her colors still flying . do anything for him and that Apple-yard was n't going to use fists . Also he seemed to understand that he was in the wrong ; that he did n't rate , for instance , a jab at Lieutenant Apple-yard 's ample solar plexus . In the wrong . That thought repeated itself . And now it applied itself emphatically to Janice herself . It was time for her to blow , and to blow as if a strong gale were at her hack . She did so . Hurrying a few steps down the hill , she slipped through the familiar gap in the hedge and , skirting the Appleyard house , cut across the back garden into the Schofields ' big place . From there she gained the refuge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dodged her mother to avoid awkward inquiries about the abandoned car , hnd softly fled up to her room . Breathless , she dropped onto the couch by the window . " I think I 've fixed it for Claire , " she said . " I have if she acts just the least bit remote and mysterious . Men are all like that  --  particularly men in uniform . " She gave vent to a sound which , scant years before , could only have been termed a giggle . She was thinking of the solemn ensign , that unwilling  --  what was it ? ? deus ex machine . " Deus ex machine , " she repeated approvingly . " At least some of my education has stuck . " She rolled over for a look across the wintry white gardens , graying into dusk . In a few minutes , now , it would be safe to go back and get her car . The ensign would be going down the hill to the harbor , down the hill and out to sea . He had served his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes that ruined his poker face would do well enough on the bridge of a ship . Suddenly she ducked . She flattened out on the couch . Then , raising her
