One down , two to go . Before the war TIME was usually banned in Italy , Germany , Japan . Now we 're back in Italy . <P> For while the first issue of our Manila Edition was being printed under fire for our troops in the Philippines ( TIME , March 5 ) , a 23rd TIME Edition was getting started half the world away . <P> TIME is now the first and only civilian magazine published in Europe for American soldiers there . It is being printed by TIME in Rome each week to reach our troops all over the Mediterranean theater almost as fast as TIME reaches readers here at home . <P> " No doubt about it-our debut was great , " Correspondent Tom Durrance cabled . <P> " Next morning early we were swamped with telephone calls . The British Embassy wanted copies-the Psychological Warfare Branch asked for copies to be distributed to its operators throughout the Balkans-the Yugoslav Legation placed a sizable order for Tito and his staff . Rest camps and hospitals were quick to ask for more , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave sold out in a few hours . <P> " Everyone in this theater-from the frontline fighting men down through the ranks of Army officers , American civilians , Italian civilians and even correspondents-has been starved for news and now they 've got it in fast , concentrated form . " <P> The same weekend TIME comes out here at home 40,000 copies of our Mediterranean Edition are run off the fabulous Tumminelli Press in Rome-and very handsome copies they are , well printed by the gravure process . ( The Tumminelli Press prints in 29 languages-produces almost all the learned books for the University of Rome . Its owner and manager , Calogero Tumminelli , is himself the author of an encyclopedia in 38 volumes . ) <P> As fast as TIME comes off the press Army trucks and planes rush copies north to our troops at the front ( 22,000 copies go this way , and 13,000 of these are given away ) . Other copies are loaded into ATC planes bound for Corsica and Sardinia , and still others travel south to Naples and Capri and on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by air courier to MTOUSA ( Mediterranean Theater of Operations , U.S. Army ) and MAAF ( Mediterranean Army Air Forces ) and 15th Army Group Headquarters , while still other copies are delivered to Army Post Exchanges , Red Cross clubs and restcamps throughout the area . And then the last remaining copies go to Rome kiosks where English-reading Italians snap them up quickly . <P> TIME-in-Rome brings to nine the number of TIME-editions printed especially for our servicemen across the oceans - for TIME was the first magazine to invent a " Pony " Edition for fast overseas delivery , and the first magazine to print a special edition for our troops in Australia , first in Hawaii , first on the Persian Gulf , in the Middle East , in India , in the Philippines . <P> Like the armed forces editions we print in Honolulu and Manila , this new Mediterranean printing is a miniature edition of TIME - a little less than two-thirds the size of the regular issue . But TIME 'S news is there unchanged - and it reaches our men at the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home !
