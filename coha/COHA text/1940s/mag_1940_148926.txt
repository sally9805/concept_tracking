For five hot days last week , crowds of middle-aged men surged through the stuffy halls of Manhattan 's Grand Central Palace , chewing cigars and mopping steamy brows . The big building was cluttered with hundreds of little booths-papered with scientific charts , decorated with hearts &; flowers , pickled fetuses , stuffed dogs , old bones , trays of purpled lungs and livers , plaster glands , transparent torsos , illuminated pictures of bathing beauties , bearded women , sissified men , monstrosities of all kinds . Shirt-sleeved barkers , with pointers in their hands and cigarets drooping from their lips , tried to entice passers-by to stop and view their wares . <P> No annex to the World 's Fair , this was the 41st annual Scientific Exhibit of the American Medical Association . The biggest and best medical show of all times , it was attended by a record crowd of 12,763 doctors from all over the U. S. The sampling doctors took home many a practical bit of new medical technique . <P> Urine for Ulcers . Women rarely have peptic ulcers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. David Jacob Sandweiss , Physiologist M. H. F. Friedman and colleagues of Detroit 's Wayne University made a purified extract of the urine of normal , healthy women , injected it under the skin of dogs in whom they had produced peptic ulcers . In several weeks the dogs recovered . Within the last two years the scientists have tried experimental urine injections on 60 patients , with " highly encouraging results . " What the healing substance is , and where it is produced , the doctors have n't the faintest idea . But they do know that in small amounts it prevents ulcer growth without inhibiting gastric secretion . Prize patient is the experimenters ' laboratory janitor , who was an ulcer man for almost a decade . Now , after a year of fortnightly injections , he has no pain , smokes cigars , eats red meat , drinks beer . <P> Rubber Noses . People whose ears are slashed off in auto accidents , or whose noses are eaten away by cancer , can not always have new ones made of flesh- &-blood; grafts . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained sculptor , molds artificial noses and ears so rosy and translucent that only an eagle eye can spot them as fakes . Dr. Bulbulian uses " prevulcanized liquid latex , " a creamy rubber compound , which can be tinted delicately before it hardens . <P> Dr. Bulbulian takes pride in matching flesh tints , in decorating his noses with tiny pores and wrinkles . Both noses and ears are glued on with a liquid adhesive made of mastic gum dissolved in chloroform or benzene . Like false teeth , false noses and ears must be doffed at night . <P> Whiskey for Arteries . In artery ailments , such as arteriosclerosis or Buerger 's disease , patients are often attacked by muscular weakness so severe that their legs buckle under them . To tone up the muscles , doctors try to send a large supply of blood to the legs . For this they give drugs to expand the blood vessels , injections of salt solution , or even cut certain tracts in the sympathetic nervous system . As a check on the blood supply they take the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that the leg is getting a large supply of blood .
