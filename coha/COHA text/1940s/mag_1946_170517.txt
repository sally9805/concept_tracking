MACBETH ( 125 pp. ) - William Shakespeare , illusfrated by Salvador Dali-Doubleday , Doran ( $3.50 ) . <P> ( Scene : A bar in Eastcheap . Enter two Elizabethan book-reviewers , one clapping the other upon the shoulder. ) 1st BR . How now , scribbler , what news this day ? 2nd BR . Alas ! this day indeed ; this Doubleday ! <P> 1st BR . Speak out , wordster ! 2nd BR . This dawn , eleven o'clock , when <P> I arose , Peering upon the world with <P> clotted eye , A package lay without my port ; ' t was brought By one whom rain nor snow nor sleet can keep From his appointed round . I clipped its cords , And saw , dust-jacketed in gold <P> and red , A spectacle acute . To say it <P> shortly : <P> Will Shakespeare 's Scottish play about Macbeth <P> Hath found a limner in McDali. 1st BR . Cawdor and Salvador ! Insane conjunction ! Is-Master Doubleday <P> Deranged i ' the wits ? 2nd BR . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manzanares Were suddenly to turn his tide , <P> and flow Regurgitant into the Firth of <P> Forth . <P> The strumming of flamencos on <P> a brae Were not more singular . And <P> add to this : <P> Surrealism 's parched , miasmic <P> winds <P> Puffed thro ' the towers of Glamis . <P> 1st BR . Stranger Catalonian never wore <P> sporran ! I pray you , good <P> fellow , itemize the damage ; <P> that I , without the hardship <P> of reading , may yet write <P> knowingly . <P> 2nd BR . Item : poor Scotia 's purply heath <P> portrayed Like to the runways used by <P> ' planes . Thereon Squat the three witches , pond'ring a takeoff . Item : <P> Facing page 42 , Lady Macbeth Is wholly chopped in two from <P> brow to chine . <P> Over the sibling halves , the <P> fierce McDali Has hung a hairdo drawn " from <P> Botticelli . <P> The lady bears two earrings , <P> one of which , Dangling displaced , in Dali 's <P> playful mode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Elsewhere , poor lady , she hath <P> no face at all , And finally her very head is <P> lopped . <P> Item : throughout these strange <P> configurations , Copied , at best , from Breughel <P> and Da Vinci , Appears a nasty crutch , the <P> which , they tell me , Is saggy emblem of the clan <P> McDali . <P> In truth , I was surprised that <P> Birnam Wood <P> Did not advance on crutches. 1st BR . Here 's a tartan would give a man goose-pimples ! What shall you tell your readers ? 2nd BR . I 'll tell them straight that , for <P> this selfsame price , Three thalers fifty groats , they <P> may procure <P> The plays of William Shakespeare all complete , Untouched by Salvador . 1st BR . Brave words , Master Critic ! <P> I 'll away and do the same . <P> The moral is as clear as lightning 's touch , <P> A healthy play runs best without a crutch .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
