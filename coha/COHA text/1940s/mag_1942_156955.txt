" They emerged like cats from everywhere , knives between their teeth . Flares did not frighten them . They broke into our right flank . Then the terrible thing happened that froze the blood of all of us . ... Men , women and children flung themselves into the attack . " <P> Thus wrote a German war correspondent . He was not describing Allied Commandos , or even Russian guerrillas . He was talking about Yugoslavia 's Partisans , who , he added , " are not wild hordes , but strictly organized units which print their own newspapers in the forests and manufacture their own bombs and munitions . " <P> The emergence of the Partisans last week as the main anti-Axis force in the Balkans opened a new phase in the complicated , triangular Civil War that has alternately smoldered and flamed in Yugoslavia ever since the German invasion nearly two years ago . The Partisans had organized an army and a state ; they were operating on a front 100 miles long and had already destroyed one Nazi Panzer column . <P> Mihailovich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. citizen had come to identify General Draja Mihailovich and his Chetniks with the resistance of the peoples of Europe to Nazi invaders. * By last week it was clear that the Partisans had eclipsed Mihailovich . Axis military communiques referred consistently to the resistance of the Partisans , rarely mentioned Mihailovich . As might be expected , Axis propaganda described the Partisans as cutthroats , Communists and bandits . In London Yugoslav officials connected with the Government in exile used the same epithets . <P> In November 1941 , General Mihailovich 's heterogeneous band suffered a serious defeat near Valjevo at the hands of German mechanized columns . The Chetnik Army splintered . Whole units under Mihailovich 's former subordinates , Gjayitch and Drenovich , joined the Italians . Others went back to their farms . Mihailovich himself retired to relative inactivity somewhere in Montenegro , avoiding action except for a sharp attack last June against a Partisan army fighting the Italians in southern Montenegro . Montenegrin Partisans charge that in certain instances Mihailovich collaborated with the Italians . <P> Nagy the Partisan . Those Chetniks who wanted to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band under the command of 32-year-old Kosta Nagy . Nagy was not an amateur . As commander of a Croat machine-gun battalion of Republican Spain 's International Brigade , Nagy had made a name by holding a position on the Ebro for weeks in spite of persistent attacks by Fascist units far better equipped . <P> The composite army under Nagy called itself the Partisans of Bosanska Krajina and became the largest and most active of half a dozen Partisan groups who fought steadily and bitterly against the Germans and Italians all through the year . <P> The Bosanska Krajina Partisans created a tiny state in the wedge-shaped area in Croatia bounded by the towns of Glamoch , Drvar , Petrovach , Kljuch and Donji Vakuf . They prepared systematically for major military operations . They trained their ever-growing armies , not for pinprick sabotage , but for a major campaign to drive the Axis from Yugoslavia .
