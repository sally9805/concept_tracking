txt Just how does Hitler 's greatly ballyhooed " rocket gun " operate ? Dispatches from inside Germany say that the rocket gun , known officially as " Urania , " fires a Shell or air bomb twice as large in length and circumference as the usual water torpedo and covered with a . powerful coat of Thomas steel . After leaving the barrel of . the gun , it is said , the shell is propelled by five or seven rockets at its tail end . PreSumably the rockets are mounted on the outside of the shell , have an aluminum covering and an exhaust similar to that used on automobiles , . and are set . off electromagnetically . Guided by . Radio The central rocket evidpntly is set off first . Then , when the shell 's velocity is about to decrease , propulsion is provided . the other rockets set off in , pairs at regular intervals . The shell , it is understood , is guided to its target , by . radio , apparently in the same manner in which the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against ships . At the present moment the German public appears to be pinning all its hopes on Urania . Expectations centering , ' around the " secret weapon " correspond in propaganda force to the publicity given to the second front in Allied countries . Just as every person in Britain who see.s . material , preparation or training for the second front belieVes that it will come , so , too , in Germany practically , everyone has an uncle , brother , or cousin who is working on the secret weapon . Hence most Germans believe it is an actuality . To , ilidge from the evidence ar- ? riving here , the " secret weapon " is a real danger for the Allies unless their air forces can again bomb the factories and laboratories where it is being made . It generally is believed in Germany as well as in the surrounding , countries that the new air bomb will be ready for use in the near future . This is the opinion held by the man in the street as well as by many technical workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lake Constande were widely dischssed here in connection with the new weapon . German illustrated weeklies recently published pictures . Showing . a tremendous ex- ' plosion : suppoSed to be froth the explosive used as- filling for the new bomb . Most Germans at this critical hOur in Germany 's history expect physical extermination froth the advancing Russians should the Soviets break through , and not much better treatment from from ** as well as a " Slave-revolt " massacre staged by the more Ahan 17 ; 000,000 , foreign workers in , Germany . Hence it is not surprising that the promise of a new weapon is seized upon like a straw by a drowning ' man . The strongest forces for continuing the war are the Nazi Party men , especially the SS . They preach faith in victory and the secret weapon . They are a ; rough-and-ready type with strong elbows who travel about Europe , usually at tender ages , on important industrial and political comi missions and have command over hundreds of thousands of persons I of conquered nations , talking as superiors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they often filled other important posts . Of these Party men . the average German , whose faith ' is often shaky , says , " they have to believe . That is their business . " However . the average German must follow their lead , as there is no other choice . " The second strongest prop . for the Nazi regime Is the youth which has known nothing but Naziism and which has been enrolled in every kind , of war service from manning antiaircraft guns at the age of 16 to agricultural leadership in occupied annexed lands . These youths believe they are " Germany 's future " and that Germany 's defeat would spoil their chances of future success Even academic youths , who are most inclined to reflection , are kept fighting by this consideration . One young student said , " We alone are capable of administering the lands which Hitler conquered not only for himself but for us and of bringing them to new bloom . "                 @ @ @ @
