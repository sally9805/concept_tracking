The difference between a party platform and a legislative program is the difference between cup and lip . Last week Administration officials were ready to talk about the 81st Congress ' legislative program . Faithful Alben Barkley , who will ride herd on the Senate , was prepared to translate at least some , of the Democratic platform promises into law . <P> End of Taft-Hartley . High on the list was repeal of the Taft-Hartley law. * If Barkley had his way a new act would be written , much more to labor 's liking . Some of the Taft-Hartley law which labor did not like : measures which outlawed the closed shop , required unions to file financial reports , required labor to hold elections to win union shop contracts , forbade union contributions to political campaigns , required officers to sign non-Communist affidavits , outlawed jurisdictional strikes and secondary boycotts . The business of new labor legislation was under the wing of Secretary of Labor Maurice Tobin , one of the few men in the Truman <P> Administration who had labored faithfully for the boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would definitely restore the closed shop . <P> Other early legislation would call for more social security . Already before Congress is a recommendation to extend social security to 20 million U.S. citizens not covered by it now , and to double fhe benefits now paid . <P> Would the President 's controversial civil liberties program come up ? Said Kentucky 's Alben Barkley : " It has n't been discussed by the President with me . I presume it will be in his message to Congress . " <P> Against Inflation . On the economic front , Congress would be asked to take steps to control inflation . In his message to the " Turnip Day " session last July , the President had asked for stand-by powers to control prices , ration scarce commodities and allocate materials in short supply . There was every indication that once again he would demand that power , to be used when necessary . <P> Other legislation which the President had asked for in July and which presumably he would ask for again : extension of rent control ( due to expire March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for building 500,000 housing units for low-income families , then something very much like it . <P> * The 81st Congress will have 54 Senators and 224 Representatives ( a majority in both houses ) who voted for Taft-Hartley . Administration officials , however , expect some changes of heart . A total of 121 Senators and Congressmen who voted for Taft-Hartley were either beaten in the primaries , retired , died or were eliminated on Election Day .
