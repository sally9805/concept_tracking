With sherifian majesty , Sidi Mohamed Ben Moulay Youssef Ben Moulay El-Hassan-Scion of the Prophet , Commander of the Faithful , Sultan of Morocco-singed the mustache of the Dictator of Spain . From the international court in Tangier he dismissed Judge Fernando Malmussi , a Fascist loyd to Benito Mussolini . With equal majesty , he appointed an anti-Fascist Italian to sit with a Briton , a Frenchman and a Spaniard-thereby giving the court an anti-Fascist majority . The new judge was Giovanni Apostoli , recommended by the Bonomi Government with the approval of London and Paris . <P> The Sultan is the nominal autocrat of three countries , in each of which somebody else is the real boss : French Morocco , the northwest shoulder of Africa ; Spanish Morocco , its epaulet ; and Tangier ( overlooking the Strait of Gibraltar ) , the chip on the shoulder . <P> Since 1928 Tangier has been internationalized and demilitarized under the joint tutelage of Britain , France , Spain and Italy , but since the fall of France in 1940 the say of the British and French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Spanish ousted Tangier 's French Administrator and the Sultan 's Mendonb ( representative ) , installed their own military governor , seized customs and communications , encouraged anti-Allied demonstrations , and winked at Axis espionage . <P> To the Francophile Sultan , living in his green and white palace at Rabat in French Morocco , this state of affairs was as unpleasant as it was to the British and the French . Sidi Mohamed had his palace , his four wives , his growing brood of sons , his 100 concubines , his French chef , his crimson carriage , his salaaming subjects , who greet him with the cry " How great is the Sultan " - an exclamation , not a question . But he was not consoled . <P> He perked up when the Allies landed in North Africa and gave him a seven-passenger U.S. limousine . He gladdened with the liberation of Paris . Last week , by exercising his nominal authority , he told the Spaniards in effect that their supposed authority was even more nominal than his . And his voice was also the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railed at the western democracies for " intolerable meddling " in Moroccan affairs .
