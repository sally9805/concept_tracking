I am tempted to begin thus : It takes a brave man to write , with criticism and regret but without empty bravado or cloying self-excoriation , about men and manhood in contemporary America . But my beginning turns back upon itself . I wonder : will my words be construed as ironic , a put-down in the guise of praise ? That would be unfortunate , first , because it is n't true and , second , because it would suggest the pervasiveness of our current cynicism . Another turn : why does the phrase " brave man " spring to my mind , flow through my pen , rather than " brave person " ? Forget , I tell myself , that you are heartily sick of person-peppered prose even as you accept the legitimacy of the intentions behind it . That reluctance alone would not account for my hesitance to call Leonard Kriegel a " brave person , " even a " brave writer " rather than  --  again the words are apt , they fit  --  a " brave man . " Simply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , too , am deeply immersed , with Kriegel , in language and meanings which are under assault . Perhaps the notion of the " brave man " still evokes a lively chain of associations and images for me , an American woman , younger than Kriegel by a decade or more , shaped in an isolated , rural Western place , not a frenetic , diverse Eastern City , Protestant rather than Jewish , yet united by being American , having read Hemingway , having gone to the same movies and been forced to face the challenge of polio at age 11 ( for Kriegel ) , 10 ( for me ) . " Brave man , " then . Were a woman ' to take up Kriegel 's challenge , the phrase " brave woman " would n't flow quite so automatically . The evaluative term " brave " , has lived more of its linguistic life in tandem with " man " than with " woman . " I ponder . Should I object strongly to Kriegel 's devoting a book to " man " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " woman " and " womanhood , " notions whose traditional implications I chafe against as I struggle with my identity as a woman , with womanhood ? What should I make of my recognition that I am an American , a reality I question and challenge but , with Kriegel , would never deny or revile ? I stop . Kriegel 's subject , finally , is not problems.of identity faced by male and female Americans within a social system fraying about the edges . He is obdurate : " I have paid the prices demanded of me and will settle for no other category than American man . " Very well . I will not shift the terrain of these reflections , nor will I evade that which Kriegel insists we confront . He cries : How can a male become a man , achieve his manhood and hold onto that achievement through courage and mastery in an age that robs him of the legacy on which he has built his self , an age that suspects , accuses , devalues and shrinks what he is and has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . no longer sustain us , and they no longer generate belief in our capacity to hand our own sense of manhood on to the next generation . " Kriegel notes dryly : " This is not the time to be young , white , and male in America . " What is at stake in his claim ? How can the social thinker explain the crisis Kriegal observes around him ? Kriegel 's insistent exploration of manhood , given his recognitiim that manhood can no longer sustain men as it once did , is best examined through conceptual analysis . Internal to the life of every culture , helping to structure , animate and sustain it , one finds ' a cluster of interlocked basic notions , ideas shared , though not shared completely , by social participants ! Such notions include images of masculinity and femininity as well as concepts of nature , authority , sex , death , God , family and community . None of these notions are sealed off from the others . This means that a serious challenge to one idea impinges on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were easily repelled and the web of basic notions held firm . There are other epochs ( ours is one ) in which the web of interconnections loosens and begins to give way . The result is that values , attitudes and ways of acting that were once " normal " may come to appear desperate , pointless  --  even laughable . If what is being challenged in our troubled era is not simply the legitimacy of those attributes traditionally labeled " masculine " or " feminine " but the very meanings of woman and man , then the fundamental delineators of identity are shaken , and a sense of anarchy threatens . " Men today , " Kriegel writes , " seem uncomfortable with their manhood , almost as uncomfortable as they seem when they deny it . As we are I caught in the crossfire between change and tradition , liberation itself becomes one more demand to measure up to , one more performance to be witnessed by other men , one more tape measure with which to define the boundaries of manhood . " How does the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumult by seeing it as the treachery of a fanatic band ? of " hostiles . " They would draw the wagons into a circle and defend a small perimeter of " basic values " to the death . Others embrace the latest style in social change , whose implications they can neither understand nor specify with coherence . They greet the future with an expansive gesture so dramatic one sometimes fails to notice that they are also throwing in the towel , and crying : I have seen the light and hereby renounce all that is male , masculine , having to do with manhood . From predator to pussycat . Kriegel will have none of this  --  neither the drawing of desperate circles nor the indignities of public mea culpas . To hold the old line renders the achieve . ment of manhood brittle , and permanently adolescent , verifying in this retreat the claims made against it . To turn oneself into an acolyte of anomie decked out in the garb of an enlightened " life style , " to become a mouthpiece for what passes this month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " fulfillment " is to compromise the moorings of the self , to sell oneself too easily , without a struggle , without the truth which comes from a battle over competing versions of what it means to be a man , a woman , an American , a decent and honorable human being . Kriegel knows that trans-formations in human identity are arduous and painful and that much may be lost as the " new world " is gained . He attempts to carve out and to defend a most difficult position by accepting as valid and inescapably true many if not all of the grievances and claims of those groups and individuals whom men as a group ' have too often treated as " other . " But he will not pay the price of his identity , his achievement of manhood . And yet . . . and yet . . . I would not be honest to my identity if I did not express my conviction that much of the struggle , quest , mastery Kriegel insistently subsumes within " man " and " manhood " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adopted many of Kriegel 's symbolic fathers ? Hemingway , Wayne , Brando ? and had to deal with the paradox of those identifications for female identity . Women , too , may define themselves through sport , and they would no doubt endorse Kriegel 's claim that sport is part of " our need for autonomy , for an existence in which skill conditioned by discipline creates a sense of adventure for both participant and observer . " Little girls as well as little boys love baseball : how do they incorporate that love into adult womanhood ? Then there were those few points at which On Men and Manhood truly jarred . Although I was moved by Kriegel 's description and defense of fatherhood as a central feature of his manhood , the troubling moments came when he  --  holding me , a sympathetic female reader , at arm 's length  --  tied that fatherhood exclusively to a relationship with sons : ! A. son remains an insurance policy which measures the reality of his father 's own emergence . " That seems rather sad . Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son in America is a judge , the barometer of whether or not a man has measured up . " More : " And fatherhood . For me , at least , birth embodied the deepest ambiguities of manhood . A man wanted the possibilities of consequences for his own sons . " Finally , with a closure that caused me to gasp , Kriegel pronounces , " Most men would choose sons . " Sadly , I accepted the truth of the blow even as I painfully recalled the studies in which ? women were asked to give the sex they preferred for their unborn children and it was learned that " most women would choose sons . " There is , in this , real pathos , even pity , and several sharp , unformed intimations of terror . What remains ? The hope that our and Kriegel 's struggle with defining and redefining the self , achieving secure identities as women , men and Americans , will usher in a future in which " man " and " manhood " are no longer held , by men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " womanhood . " This future can not be some androgynous hallucination in which de-sexed beings would neither need nor make distinctions but a way of life structured and given meaning by basic notions that will not , chillingly , decree the female identity to be a lower achievement , of meaner purpose than the male . ? The Ghost of England Past RICHARD GILMAN A bright young Englishwoman who had just come to the United States for the first time told me recently how disappointed she had been that America was so little different from England , until she realized that it was England that had become sq much like America . I had observed this myself during the summer , when I was in London for the first time in more than five years . There were coffee bars wherever you turned but one was hard put to find a place to have tea . American movies were everywhere , but there was n't ya single British-made film showing in London during my entire stay . More broadly , whatever influences London was absorbing from us , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monuments to its past , a sense of distinctiveness , an autonomous energy and purpose . It seemed seedier than I had ever known it , strangely provincial , small , tight and predictable . I had always come to London with an Richard Gilman will be contributing a monthly column on cultural matters to The Nation . intellectual expectancy . I looked forward to the theater , the bookstores , to ideas and wit , high standards for the mind . London set these on its own and also was a place where new European thought and work came sooner than it did to us . A capital of the intellect . It was n't that I was caught in any traditional mood of American inferiority ; I knew perfectly well that ever since the war our culture had been far more energetic than theirs , more original and adventurous . But something about England , about London at least , remained extremely attractive . In this slowly shrinking culture , anchored as it was to a splendid past , there continued to exist clear criteria of intelligence , lucid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessively , diverse and " spontaneous " artistic and intellectual life had difficulty locating . This was especially true of the theater . In America , in New York at any rate , the theater had since the late 1950s been much more robust in certain ways than in England , far more open to experiment , more restless and inventive . There was nothing in England to compare with groups like the Living Theater and the Open Theater ; Off and Off Off Broadway had no counterparts in London to their diversity and vigor , and the great European theorists ? Brecht , Artaud , Grotowski  --  had , after a glance at them in London , been taken up here with much greater enthusiasm ( for better or worse ) than they had by the English . Yet there were several things about the British theater that for years remained enviable to us , that we prized and went to London to encounter . The most obvious was , of course , the quality of British acting , seemingly so superior to ours , so assured , supple as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies that were n't really experimental but maintained the art of ensemble playing at a level far beyond what our groups were capable of . And then there had for some years been two or three British playwrights for every one of ours , and the best of them ? Pinter , Arden , Edward Bond  --  were several cuts above our best . What was perhaps most important about these playwrights was that there was nothing provincial , nothing narrowly local about them ; to one degree or another their plays were exemplary of the recent , universal imagination of disaster , loss , disjunction . In films the British had had something to teach us . Until the early 1970s they had produced a number of movies ? Room at the Top , Saturday Night and Sunday Morning , Darling , This Sporting Life , etc. ? which , while less complex and resonant than those of the great European film makers of the same period , were still intelligent , clear and much less sentimental and tendentious than most of our own " important " movies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gap between our vigor and theirs was perhaps greater than in any art except literature , there were still some figures one could greatly admire ? Henry MoOre and Barbara Hepworth , Francis Bacon and David Hackney . And then there were the magazines , all those crisp , intelligent journals , from the Spectator and the New Statesman to Sight and Sound and Theatre Quarterly , whose American counterparts seemed amateurish by comparison . Now on my recent visit to London everything struck me as declining , moribund , if that is n't too strong a word . A three-week sojourn may situate you in an untypical period , but always , in the past there had been excitements , discoveries , no matter how short a time I 'd been there . , Now there was almost nothing . To begin with , as I 've said , there seem to be no British movies anymore ( the result of some hard economics , no doubt ) , and television , into which a great deal of energy and talent had recently gone that had earlier gone into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is everywhere extremely thin , icing without a cake . In the graphic arts all I saw was a large vacuum filled by American influences to the point of nearly total imitation . A huge show of recent British painting and sculpture at the Heywood Gallery , which is part of the National Theatre complex on the South Bank , seemed to be mostly composed of lesser works by Lichtenstein , Dine , Warhol and Rauschenberg , and the same was , true of the recently opened modern British wing at the Tate . ( It was there that I had the most satisfying esthetic experience of my trip : in the Turner rooms , especially among those great unfinished mysterious paintings that seem to leap over a century of artistic time. )
