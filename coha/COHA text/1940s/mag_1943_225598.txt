At World War I 's end , tough-minded , ingenious Kent Cooper , traffic manager of the Associated Press , was in Paris . There he suggested to Allied peacemakers that the Versailles Treaty include a clause guaranteeing worldwide freedom of the press . He got astute support from Colonel Edward M. House , but from few others . <P> This week Kent Cooper , now A.P . ' s executive director , renewed the fight . In an article written for a " Journalism in War-Time " symposium , he proposed that international freedom of news exchange be made a cardinal principle of any future peace treaties . Back of his proposal was a sound newsman 's unshakable conviction : if universal dissemination of truth can be guaranteed in the postwar world , the chances of new wars occurring will become remote . Said he : <P> " One cause of war is perverted presentation of international news . . . . And it is the truth that makes men free . " <P> He conceded the probability that newsmen would not be allowed to sit at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists unite , demand a peace treaty clause on press freedom . Specifically , he urged that foreign correspondents be given free and direct access to all the news of all nations , with equal facilities for sending the news to their own countries . <P> Better Chance ? This time Kent Cooper 's proposal seemed to have some chance . Precedent had already been established . <P> At the urging of Cordell Hull , the Moscow Conference agreed , in language reminiscent of the U.S. Bill of Rights , that : " Freedom of speech , of religious worship , of political belief , of press and of public meeting shall be restored in full measure to the Italian people . . .. " * Even a hard-headed realist like Kent Cooper had reason to hope that Allied statesmen would feel the same way about Germany and other Axis powers , that Russia would fall into line of her own motion . <P> Said Edwin L. James , managing editor of the New York Times : <P> " Of course , a free press can not be decreed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of a free press consecrated in the peace treaty is going to help . . . . One can be cynical and argue that it is all eyewash because Stalin is no more going to permit a free press in Russia than he has in the past . That may be true , and then again it may not . <P> " It might be imagined that the position of Stalin after the war will be such that he and his party need not fear an opposition press . . . . But , in any event , Americans who believe that there resides some virtue in a free press ought to be thankful to Judge Hull . . . . The matter of a free press is now on the peace table agenda . " <P> <P> *Says the Bill of Rights : " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble ...
