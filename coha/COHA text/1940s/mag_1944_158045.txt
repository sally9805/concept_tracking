The war swept past Mont-Saint-Michel last week , but some enraptured U.S. troops stopped to stare . A half century ago another U.S. visitor , Henry Adams , saw the same towering , church-crowned rock in the sea off Avranches , felt the same compulsion . Wrote he in Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres : <P> " The church stands high on the summit of this granite rock , and on its west front is the platform , to which the tourist ought first to climb . From the edge of the platform , the eye plunges down , two hundred and thirty-five feet , to the wide sands or the wider ocean , as the tides recede or advance , under an infinite sky , over a restless sea . . . . <P> " Here is your first eleventh-century church ! . . . Serious and simple to excess ! is it not ? Young people rarely enjoy it . They prefer the Gothic . ... No doubt they are right , since they are young : but men and women who have lived long and are tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and self-restraint as they feel nothing else . The quiet strength of these curved lines , the solid support of these heavy columns , the moderate proportions , even the modified lights , the absence of display , of effort , of self-consciousness , satisfy them as no other art does . They come back to it to rest , , after a long circle of pilgrimage-the cradle of rest from which their ancestors started . " <P> The troops shared Henry Adams ' feeling . Said one : " This is the place to spend the war . " Said another : " This place looks just like something out of the book . It will sure be something to tell the wife . "
