w ill ' do you think she 's watching us ? " Pierce asked . The woman still stood in the doorway , looking at them with an odd , puzzled expression on her face . " Maybe she wants a drink , " Anderson said . " Maybe she thinks we 're crazy , " Pierce said . He felt a little ill at ease from her presence . Anderson dipped a spoon into the mixture and tasted it . " With a little sugar it 'll be fine . " When the sugar was added they both tasted the result . The finished product was creamy and yellow and had the familiar look of eggnog . " Just a little , tiny bit more sugar , " Anderson said . He sifted more sugar into the pitcher , then they both tasted the eggnog again . " Perfect , " Pierce said . " Just perfect . We ought to get some of the boys .

He went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierce filled each with eggnog , then he ceremoniously lifted one of the glasses and brought it to the woman . She stared at it , as though it was some-thing strange , but made no move to take it . " Here , " Pierce said , holding it closer to her . He noticed suddenly that tears had come into her eyes , watched her with surprise as she turned quickly , went from the kitchen and out the back door of the house . " Well , I 'll be damned , " Anderson said . " That 's funny , " Pierce said , " what 's gotten into her ? " " Maybe she thinks it 's poison . Well , drink up . " They lifted their glagges and toasted each other solemnly . " To the States , " Anderson said . " To China , you mean , " Pierce corrected .

Grade 5B and the Well-Fed Rat FRANCES GRAY PATTON D EAR PARENT , " said the Mimeo- graphed letter from the Parent-Teacher 's Association of the Oak-lawn School , " In this atomic age the future safety of civilization depends upon a truly scientific atmosphere . The boys and girls of today will be the men and womenof tomorrow . At our meeting , Wednesday November 14 , Miss Oates ' grade , 5B-1 , will take over the program to show we parents how our little folk are progressing in this direction . " Mrs. Potter sighed when she read it . Her daughter , Elinor , was in grade 5B-1 . M RS . POTTER made a point of staying away from schools . They depressed her . The very odor of their halls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into that nervous dullness of childhood from which she , by the grace of time , had thankfully escaped . Her first two children were boys . They seemed fond of their mother , and not abnormally ashamed of her . They accompanied her on bird-walks in the woods , and sometimes even to a movie  --  though they did not sit with her there because , they explained , they could see better from the front row . They talked openly to her about sex and tropical fish and airplane motor frequency . But they did not discuss their school affairs . And on the rare occasions when she was obliged to come to their school ( to bring forgotten notebooks , for instance , or raincoats when the weather had changed unexpectedly ) , their embarrassment was pathetic . They greeted her vaguely , like people who " know the face , but ca n't recall the name . " It suited Mrs. Potter . But Elinor was different . To Elinor school was the stuff of life , and she brought it home with her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered , somehow , their private histories and philosophies . She recounted everything at the dinner table . " Miss Oates had lipstick on her teeth again today , " Elinor would remark . " It was probably her mother 's fault . Miss Oates lives with this old , old mother , and sometimes she beats Miss Oates to the bathroom in the morning and she stays in there so long  --  you know how old people are ! ? that Miss Oates does n't have time to fix herself up before school . Poor Miss Oates ! I do n't like lipstick on teeth . " Or she would lean forward , pudding spoon halfway to her mouth , and announce solemnly : " Miss Bangs , our new music teacher , loves God . She really loves Him . " Elinor liked , also , to share her homework with her family . Her eyes shone as she recited the multiplication table or the trials of the Jamestown Colony . Her voice was full of proud emotion when she read her compositions aloud . One of these ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this chapter in Tales of Distant Lands , " declared Elinor , " I know that if I woke up tomorrow morning in the middle of the Desert of Sahara , I would feel perfectly at home . " ( She probably would at that , thought Mrs. Potter . Anybody who feels at home in a public school would feel at home any-where . ) It was entertaining . It might have been entirely charming if Elinor had not begun urging her mother to visit the school . Other mothers came all the time ; was n't her mother interested in education ? " Miss Oates thinks the school and the home should co-operate , " said Elinor . " And besides , " she added , " everybody wants to see you , I 've told them you look like a pin-up girl . " This bit of flattery was irresistible . Mrs. Potter , though well-preserved , was plumpish and close to forty . She promised Elinor that next time her class was on the program she would attend the P. T. A. meeting . It had seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the letter in her hand , she knew she was caught . On the morning of the appointed Wednesday Mrs. Potter awoke with a heaviness , like a cold , undigested pancake , on her stomach . Then she heard her husband gargling in the bathroom and she took heart . Maybe , she thought , he was coming down with a strep throat , and she would have to stay home and nurse him . But he said he was all right  --  he was just gargling as a precaution because there were some colds in the office . " I guess this is it , " she said bleakly , and went down to the kitchen to start the cereal . Elinor was too excited to eat much breakfast . She was to make the longest speech of all . She had not said the speech at home because she wanted it to be a surprise for her mother , and now she was afraid she did n't know it . She stared down at her plate and kept mumbling something about rats . " Mama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't let her go crazy right here at the breakfast table . She takes my appetite away . " " Suppose I forget something , " said Elinor , trembling , " before those thousands of people ! " " I do n't suppose there 'll be many people , " murmured Mrs. Potter soothingly . It was the wrong thing to say . " You mean we wo n't have a good audience ? " demanded Elinor . In a gesture of despair she clapped her hand to her head . " My hair ! " she moaned , holding out a yellow wisp in her fingers . " Oh , I wish I had some glamour . I have to get up there on that stage  --  without any glamour ! " She moaned again as she gathered up her books . But it was a moan , Mrs. Potter knew , made half of ecstasy . " Wear your new girdle , Mama , " said Elinor , " and use enough lipstick . Do n't get it on your teeth . " B EFORE the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She disliked painted fingernails , but this time she permitted the manicurist to give her a brilliant polish called Frozen Flame . She was not going to let Elinor down . Then she went to a department store where she bought a red rayon carnation to pin on her coat . She thought she looked very nice . She almost believed she was going to enjoy the meeting . After all , she told herself , her attitude of aloofness toward her children 's education was self-indulgent and anti-social . More than that , it was ignorant ; it was based upon some infantile fixation of her own . Times had changed . The public school must have changed with them , and  --  witness Elinor 's enthusiasm  --  for the better . But when she went into the school it did not smell very different . It did not look different , either . The walls were painted the same pale tan  --  a faintly nauseating color  --  and on the wall the same peasant girl still listened to her lark . As she walked down the concrete hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapping behind her , like some hopeless monotony that would shadow her all her life . At the door of the auditorium she was welcomed by Miss Oates . Her teeth , Mrs. Potter saw with relief , were clean as the proverbial hound 's . Miss Oates , when Mrs. Potter introduced herself , exclaimed in evident surprise : " Are you Elinor 's mother ? " She gave her a long look , equally appraising and disappointed . Mrs. Potter found a seat among the score of other mothers who were , she saw , as carefully coifed , as resolutely complacent as she herself . There was time only for the briefest interchange of compliments on one another 's " darling children " before Miss Bangs began playing the piano . ( Mrs. Potter found herself thinking irreverently that God might have rewarded that lady 's devotion with the gift of greater talent ! ) Thirty children filed out upon the stage , singing " We march , we march , to vic-to-ree , " in fresh , tuneless voices . The children all looked healthy and clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bright , starched dresses of the girls belled out like field flowers . Their eyes were steady and serious , as if some transcendent emotion arose to sweep the least trace of frivolity from them . They made a touching picture . Her Elinor , Mrs. Potter observed , was pale . She looked as if she had been crying and had just washed her face . But she seemed composed . She stood primly , with her hands crossed , like little limp fish , over her middle . When she caught her mother 's glance , she shot her a swift , tremulous smile . Miss Oates mounted the rostrum . She was a thin , tall woman . She curved her body a little from the waist , as if to reduce the impression of its length . She fingered her pearls as she talked , and her features assumed the languid lines of patronizing whimsy . But her prominent blue eyes were coy and restless . Mrs. Potter felt sorry for her , and sorry , too , that she did not like her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day of racial unrest and the atom bomb ? " Mrs. Potter shivered . Suddenly the pretty children on the platform looked unsubstantial , doomed , like the over-bright figures in a nightmare . What earthly relevance had the race problem to the matter in hand , and why drag in the bomb at this juncture ? The woman was a plain fool . Mrs. Potter bowed her head in vicarious shame . " In this atomic age , " Miss Oates continued , " this time of changing val-yews , we must dare to change our methods also . Therefore , when the fifth graders took up the study of nutrition , we did not give them dead books , but live , vibrant material . The Health Department kindly donated two white rats . We named one of them Wiffles , and the other one Squiffies . " She paused , smiling graciously . The audience made a sound that Mrs. Potter supposed might be called " an appreciative titter . " " Wiffles , " said Miss Oates , " had his private cage , and Squiffles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs and vegetable stew , Mr. Squiffles received only cookies and coca-cola . At first we thought Squiffles was the lucky rat , but we soon changed our minds . Willies began to look like a great big Marine sergeant , and Squiffles was just a poor little 4-F . But I 'm going to let our young scientists tell you the rest . I know you want to hear , in their own little words , just what they 've learned with their honest , inquiring little minds . So , ladies and gentlemen , " here she dimpled at the principal , a bald , sleepy-looking man , " and mothers of the fifth grade , I want to introduce somebody you already know  --  The Class of Five B One . " Miss Oates retired into the wings . Everybody clapped . A stout , pink-cheeked boy came forward . He gave his bulging pants a hitch , and began to talk in challenging , uninflected tones . " In this atomic age , " he said , " we must all be scientists . " Mrs. Potter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay much attention , either , to the girl who maintained that , since the discovery of the airplane and the atom bomb , it was necessary to learn the rules of health . Mrs. Potter was waiting for Elinor . Elinor , whose job was to sum up the results of the class experiment , was the last to speak . Mrs. Potter thought she was infinitely better than the others . In the first place , she looked exactly the way a tenyear-old girl ought to look . Even her straight hair , with its bothersome cowlick , had all the weedy grace of childhood ; it made the ringlets of the other girls look artificial . And she spoke her piece in a rapid , businesslike way , without any hesitation or any fancy frills . " The characteristics of the well-fed rat , " said Elinor , " are different from the characteristics of the poorly-fed rat . The well-fed rat is heavier . The fur of the well-fed rat is soft and creamy . The poorly-fed rat has sore eyes , and his fur is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has a bad disposition . He is ready to dart out of his cage whenever the door is opened . The well-fed rat has a calm , kind disposition . He is contented with his surroundings and does not wish to leave his cage . His tail is pink and waxy . " AFTER the program was over Mrs. Potter stayed to congratulate Miss Oates upon the performance of her pupils . The children were marching off the stage through a back door , but Elinor darted from the line ( like the poorly-fed rat , thought Mrs. Potter ) , and bounced over the footlights to her mother 's side . Miss Oates came down , too , but by the steps . " We 're glad to see Mummy , are n't we , Elinor ? " she said . There was something subtly menacing in her tone . " It was really remarkable , Miss Oates , " said Mrs. Potter . " I 'm sure we were never so poised in the fifth grade . " Then , in an attempt to add a friendly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But it 's sad , is n't it , that the well-fed rat liked his cage . Is the desire for freedom only the desire for food ? " Miss Oates curved her lips slightly . It was the sort of smile , Mrs. Potter remembered , that teachers kept for parents who tried to be funny . " That 's what the chart told us , " Elinor said . " It said the well-fed rat liked his cage . It was n't that way with our Willies . " She gulped on the last word . Miss Oates gave her an uneasy look . " But , Elinor , " said Mrs. Potter , " I thought you said in your report ? " " You see , Mrs. Potter , " said Miss Oates , " the Health Department furnished us with a chart on rat nutrition to help us find our facts , but the rats did n't always cooperate . Squiffles , our poorly-fed rat , just cowered in a corner ? " " With a blank expression on his face , " said Elinor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel all comfy , was forever trying to get out . Once he did escape , did n't he , Elinor ? " " Yes , Miss Oates , " said Elinor , " and bit the blood out of Randy Adams when he caught him . " " We disinfected Randy 's finger with iodine , " Miss Oates said quickly . Mrs. Potter was honestly puzzled . " I thought , " she said , " that the class just observed the rats first-hand , and drew its own conclusions . " " That 's right , " said Miss Oates patiently , " we observed them for a month . We fed and weighed them every day . Then , with the chart as a guide , we made out our reports . " " I see , " said Mrs. Potter . But she wondered if she did . " But , " said Miss Oates , " when we compared our findings with those on the chart we saw that something , somewhere , had gone wrong . Maybe there was something funny about the rats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions properly . I do n't know . " She shrugged helplessly . " Frankly , I 've never been good at science . I was always more the esthetic type . " " I know , " said Mrs. Potter vaguely . " Anyhow , " said Miss Oates , " our results were n't exactly what we 'd expected . We had promised to give this program and we simply did n't have time to do the experiment all over again . But we knew from the Health Department what facts we ought to have found , so  --  well , we just decided to take the bull by the horns and go ahead and find them ! In this atomic age , we ca n't afford to be narrow about facts , can we ? I mean we have to realize their broader implications . And after all , " she finished , on a note of inspiration , " things often do n't turn out right the first time  --  even at Oak Ridge . " " Indeed they do n't , " agreed Mrs. Potter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've dissipated long enough . / must go see what my class is doing . I believe in trusting children , you know . In times like these they have to learn self-reliance . And then I check up on them . Elinor , would you like to spend five whole minutes alone with Mummy ? Be sure to ask her to come again . " " Maybe Elinor could show me the rats , " suggested Mrs. Potter . A glint of something like exasperation shone in Miss Oates ' eyes . " I do wish she could , " she said , " but the truth is we 've had a minor tragedy in our midst . When we took the covers off the cages this morning we found something that made us all feel dreadfully blue . " She pursed her mouth ruefully and dropped her voice . " The well-fed rat was dead . " She began to back off with her eyes fixed warily on Elinor . " Bye-bye , " she said , and was gone . HATE her , " said Elinor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a cold , black-hearted woman . " Mrs. Potter was dismayed . " Oh no , darling  --  you do n't ! " she cried . " You do n't hate anybody . " " I hate Miss Oates , " said Elinor flatly . " She would n't even let us have a funeral for him . " " But she was so busy , " said Mrs. Potter . " And she has that poor old mother ! " " I feel sorry for Miss Oates ' mother , " said Elinor . " Imagine thinking you were going to have a nice baby , and it turning out to be Miss Oates ! She has no feeling for children or rats or anything . Mama , loved Willies . He was a sweet rat . " " Maybe he 's happy somewhere , " said Mrs. Potter . It seemed the only thing to say . " He did n't look happy , " said Elinor . " He looked awful dead , He was lying on his back with his feet up in the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sob quietly . " We wanted to cremate him like we read in the paper Jerome Kern was cremated . We were going to build a funeral pyre on the playground , and dance around it singing hymns . But ole Quaker Oats would n't let us . Do you know what she said ? " " What did she say ? " asked Mrs. Potter , aware of an ignominious sympathy for Miss Oates . " She said : In this atomic age we have no time to play funeral with rats . ' And then ? " Elinor 's voice shook with grief and scorn ? " she picked him up , by his pink , waxy tail , and gave him to the janitor . " Mrs. Potter kissed Elinor and patted her on the shoulder . She wiped her wet W. ' 11110N1104 cheeks with a handkerchief . " I guess you 'll have to go now , baby , " she said . " It was a lovely program , anyhow , " She fished a nickel out of her purse . " After school get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she saw Elinor 's face brighten , Mrs. Potter felt like crying . The quick shift of a child 's mood , like sunlight running up the beach on the heels of a cloud , had always been a thing to move her deeply . She had an impulse to snatch Elinor out of these borogoves of pious confusion and set her free in the simple light of day . But ofcourse she did no such thing . She only smiled and watched her little girl skip jauntily off to Miss Oates ' home room . And a minute later when she , herself , walked down the hall , Mrs. Potter felt comforted . The old smell of chalk and peanuts , the hollow , reverberating sound of her own shoes , the pastoral rapture  --  expressed in sepia  --  of Millet 's rustic , all managed to put reality smugly in its place . Life seemed inept and innocent and debonair . Even the split atom lost its terrors for the moment and became just something people talked about at P.T.A . meetings .
