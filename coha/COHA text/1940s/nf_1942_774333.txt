Many farmers found it impossible to meet these conditions . Many could not even keep up the interest payments . This created a serious problem , not only for the farmer , but also for those who had lent him money and were counting on the repayment of the principal or the prompt payment of interest in order to pay their own rent , food , and clothing bills . Taxes become oppressive to the farmer when they mount while prices of his commodities go down . Taxes per acre of farm real estate went up for decades , until 1929 . During 1929 ? 34 there was a drop of 37 per cent . Since 1934 farm taxes have again mounted .

The farmer 's bargaining position is weak also because of lack of knowledge . Few occupations require as much versatility as farming . A farmer must perform the functions of capitalist , laborer , and enterpriser . He has to know the technique of plowing , planting , cultivating , and harvesting a half dozen or more crops and that of feeding and caring for horses , cattle , hogs , and chickens in order to carry on his routine operations . In addition , he has to do an endless variety of odd jobs , such as repairing buildings and machinery , spraying fruit trees , and caring for sick animals . Besides all these responsibilities he has certain decisions to make and duties to perform like a businessman . He must decide when to buy feed and supplies , when to sell his products , and how  | to sell them . He must oversee his hired workers , keep accounts , and follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these things exceptionally well and find it difficult to compete . This discussion has attempted to point out the reasons why the farmer has less to say about the prices of his products than the people to whom he sells them . Many farmers try to strengthen their position by marketing their products co-operatively . It is estimated that more than two million American farmers sell part or all of their products through co-operatives . The aims of co-operative marketing associations are : 1 . To prevent the dumping of farm products on the market faster than these products can be absorbed by consumers , which would lower prices . 2 . To improve methods of grading , packing , and preparing products for the market . This is especially true of fruits and vegetables . 3 . To set a standard for products . They try to prevent inferior qualities from being sold as superior qualities . 4 . To better the farmer 's bargaining position by united effort . Sellers in these marketing associations are not competing with each other but are united to bargain collectively with buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 5 . To reduce marketing costs by a managed program of distribution . Co-operative purchasing , like co-operative marketing , has been growing slowly for a long time . In 1936 . oneeighth of all farm supplies were purchased co-operatively through 4,472 co-operatives , whose purchases were valued at $315,000,000.  | Farmers can help themselves by co-operating with experiment stations and agricultural colleges in the search for new uses for their products and also by developing new products . Paper , lumber , and insulating material have been made from corn and cotton stalks , a plastic substance from milk . Experiments have proved the feasibility of many new uses for farm products . Experience with soybeans , first introduced in this country about 1920 , shows the possibilities of new products . Today we use soybeans for flour , salad oil , cooking fat , breakfast foods , macaroni ; feeds and fertilizers for farm use ; soap , enamel , paints , linoleum , printing inks , lubricating oil , celluloid , and glycerin . To these and many other uses science is adding constantly . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The list tends to grow longer year by year . The farmer has been helped by governmental aids to education . The Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890 , the Smith-Lever Extension Act of 1914 , and the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917 provided Federal aid to such agencies as universities teaching agricultural subjects and high schools offering work in agriculture and maintaining certain standards . The government has aided agriculture by making provisions for the reclamation of semi-arid lands and swamplands . The Department of Agriculture is a vast research organization covering every conceivable phase of farm life on both  | the technical and business sides . Its findings are published and can be readily obtained . Only a few of the many legislative acts passed to aid the farmer can be mentioned here . Congress in 1916 created a series of Federal land banks , one in each of 12 districts , to enable farmers to borrow money on their land at a low rate of interest and for a long while . Since then , many other farm credit facilities have been created under government auspices . In 1933 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly created Farm Credit Administration . The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929 sought to organize farmers into co-operative associations to ( 1 ) minimize speculation ; and ( 2 ) prevent or control surpluses . This act came into operation just as a world-wide depression began . It failed in its purpose of stabilizing prices . The agricultural acts passed since 1933 have differed from the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929 in attempting to control the supply of basic farm products , while the earlier law simply aimed at orderly marketing of goods after they were produced . By controlling the production of basic farm products the laws attempt to raise the price of those products so as to give the farmer greater purchasing power . The first Agricultural Adjustment Act , passed in 1933 , encouraged farmers to restrict production of cotton , wheat , tobacco , corn , and hogs in order to raise the prices of these commodities . Acreage not planted with any of these crops might be put into grasses and legumes . Farmers were paid cash benefits for reducing acreage . The money for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of certain farm products : namely , wheat , cotton , hogs , and tobacco . The act of 1933 was declared unconstitutional in 1936 . It was followed by the Soil Conservation Act , which was intended to induce farmers to restrict their acreage of certain crops in order to conserve the soil . Benefit payments were based on soil-building practices . The act thus sought to  | accomplish two aims : ( 1 ) to encourage practices that will conserve our soil ; and ( 2 ) to reduce supply of certain commodities so that the farmers might receive higher prices . The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 provided for the continued operation of the Soil Conservation Act in normal times . In years of overproduction of certain basic crops ( wheat , cotton , corn , tobacco , and rice ) the Secretary of Agriculture may set up a compulsory marketing quota for each farmer , after receiving the approval of two-thirds of the farmers who are to vote on the proposal . A farmer is penalized if he exceeds his quota . The act of 1938 also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities that they hold . A plan for insuring the wheat crop against losses due to drought , flood , tornado , hail , wind , plant disease , and insect infestation is also included . The 1938 act was de- signed to accomplish the same ends as the 1933 act , but it dropped the processing taxes . Funds for benefit payments were to be raised by general taxation . Since 1933 it has been the aim of agricultural legislation to raise farm prices to " parity . " This has been defined to mean that the prices of the basic crops shall bear the same relation to the prices of the things the farmer buys as existed during specified years , frequently 1909-1914 . The Farm Security Administration oversees projects for resettlement and rehabilitation of destitute or low-income rural families . In most cases the government has made loans to the families for land and equipment . The Farm Security Administration also allocates ( a ) funds for the relief of tenant farmers , and ( b ) funds for the purchase of submarginal lands to be taken out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balanced agriculture . There must be balance between the production of the farmers ' fields and the consumption of their product . There must be balance between the income of the farmers and the income of their neighbors in the cities and towns . ' Traditionally we have put our faith the operation of competition in agriculture . This means that when more is produced than can be sold at a price sufficient to cover costs of production , farmers will sooner or later stop producing and go into other occupations . The forces of competition might be slow to bring about a balance between production and market demand . A second serious objection to permitting competition to have free rein in agriculture is that if people are driven off the farms there is no real place for them in the city . Since farmers who can not make more than their barest expenses remain on their farms , there is danger of their completely exhausting the land because they can not afford to fertilize it .

Prices of farm products will go up only when our soil is exhausted so that we can not grow enough to feed and clothe our population liberally . Another form of the argument for maintaining competition in agriculture is that if small independent farmers can not operate successfully we must resort to large-scale or corporate farming . Farming on a large scale , however , has its drawbacks . It is very expensive to obtain efficient managers and foremen . Overhead costs are high . Will not most farm work be done by seasonal workers ? Is it desirable to displace the independent , settled , property-owning farmer with such unsettled , propertyless workers ? Most of us think it is not .  | It has been suggested that the government should buy the submarginal lands , which give low yield , and take them out of their present use . Such lands might be planted with trees or turned into game refuges or parks . This plan has much to commend it .

Many people believe the farm problem could be materially simplified by lowering tariffs so that foreigners could sell their goods here . They could then buy some of our agricultural products . The American tariff is an important barrier to foreign buying . It curtails foreign purchasing power and therefore seriously reduces exports of agricultural commodities . The tariff will be discussed more fully in The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 can help temporarily toward a balanced agriculture . Almost no one believes that such legislation offers a permanent solution . The supporters of the policy of lowering tariffs argue that until we can reduce them sufficiently to exchange our farm products for the goods of foreign nations , we must cut farm production to what we can use at home and must sell abroad at prices that will give our farmers a chance at a decent living . The difficulties of this policy are many . They may be summarized thus : 1 . It would be necessary for individual farmers to take orders from Washington about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very difficult to enforce acreage restrictions against farmers , but even if they did cut down their acreage , there would be a constant tendency to use fertilizers or to select seeds more scientifically , so that production per acre would rise . 3 . If we raise our prices artificially , our rivals in other countries have a chance to take foreign markets away from us ; this has already happened in the case of cotton . 4 . If the policy of restricting everyone 's production were  | to function , it would tend to keep in business those who are inefficient and would not provide a sufficient reward for efficient methods in agriculture . From what has been said , it must be evident that to achieve a balanced agriculture is extremely difficult . Any road we choose has many pitfalls .

Are any of the products of your community sold abroad ? Has the amount sold abroad increased or decreased during the past ten years ?

Tourists travel in foreign countries and spend money there for food and other commodities . Citizens of one nation may buy insurance policies from those of another and must then pay premiums to them ; later , when the policies become due , payments move in the opposite direction . Ships of one nation are used to transport materials for the people of a different nation . Stocks and bonds of corporations are owned in other countries besides those in which the businesses were established ; dividends and interest on them move across boundaries to their foreign owners . Such transactions may be spoken of as invisible items of foreign trade , to distinguish them from visible imports and exports of commodities .

Treating foreign trade separately is necessary only because national governments have imposed many restrictions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements of money and other invisible items . Nations can exist without the products or resources of other nations , but the standard of living in countries that restrict foreign trade unduly must be lower than they need to be . If we imported no foods , we would have few bananas or tropical nuts . Instead of coffee , tea , or cocoa we would probably have a drink made from roasted barley or chicory . We would have no chocolate candy or vanilla ice cream . Without imports women would have fewer varieties of perfumed cosmetics and no platinum wedding rings or diamond jewelry . Tin cans would be missing from the pantry shelf . We have been importing large quantities of wood pulp for the manufacture of newsprint , hides , and practically all our raw silk , tin , nickel , chromium , and rubber , as well as materials used in making paints and varnishes .  | Japan , with a cheaper labor supply , can raise silkworms and produce silk much more cheaply than we can . We therefore import Japanese silk . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Countries may have an absolute advantage in the production of any commodity because of climate , natural resources , skill of workers , or lower standard of living . In some other cases , on the other hand , nations have only a comparative advantage in the production of certain articles ; a country may import an article that it can produce more cheaply than another nation if it can produce something else to still greater advantage . This may seem complicated , but it can be illustrated from everyday life . The lawyer may be able to do a better job of mowing his lawn than anyone whom he can hire ; yet he pays a boy to do it for him because it is more profitable for him to spend his time in the practice of his profession . In the same way , the United States may be able to produce woolen cloth cheaper than England , but we prefer to put our efforts into growing cotton or manufacturing automobiles or farm machinery , because in them we have a greater comparative advantage . We sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we need . We produce more of such commodities as cotton , wheat , pork , tobacco , copper , and automobiles than our own public will buy at profitable prices . During recent years the foreign market for cotton has declined and we have had large quantities in our warehouses , in spite of attempts to induce farmers to leave great areas of cotton land idle . Reduction in acreage has left many farm workers unemployed , as well as many ordinarily engaged in shipping and handling cotton . Probably many of those thrown out of work have gone on relief . Any other commodity might be used to illustrate the principle that exports help us to prosperity .  | Many of our industries have grown with the expectation of a constant foreign market , and a portion of their product is regularly sent abroad . In other lines , producers find themselves from time to time with a supply of goods that can not be sold at home at prevailing prices ; often such a surplus can be sold abroad only at much lower prices than prevail at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get . He may lose on the transaction , but he covers at least part of his costs and may hope to make up his loss from the portion of his output that he can expect to sell in the home market at good prices . This practice amounts to dumping our products in the foreign market . Dumping frequently leads to unsatisfactory relations between nations , because goods handled in this way are often sold at prices which even lower-cost producers in the importing nations can not meet . Lasting and satisfactory trade between nations can be built only on the basis of buying and selling goods at prices that will not upset the businesses of either country .  | If we consider the so-called invisible items , the total amount owed by any nation and the amount it has coming to it from others will be very nearly equal . A " favorable " balance of trade means that we are selling more goods than we are buying , but it tells us nothing about the invisible items ( see page 214 ) . If other nations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could they pay ? International balances are normally paid in gold , and eventually we would have all the gold in the world . But the debtor nations would probably take steps to avoid paying out all their gold . In the long run the amounts due this country from other countries must tend to equal what we owe them . Since 1901 our foreign trade in commodities has increased . It grew very rapidly during the war period , slumped in 1921 and 1922 , and then increased from 1922 to 1929 . From 1929 to 1933 it shrank greatly . After 1933 a new upward trend appeared in the value of our foreign trade .  | Congress has passed several measures designed to stimulate foreign trade , particularly exports . The Webb-Pomerene Act of 1918 exempted from the provisions of the Sherman and Clayton Acts combinations entered into for the sole purpose of exporting . Several associations have been organized under this law . Congress has also provided for special institutions for financing foreign trade . Special banks have been organized in the United States , and national banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade with other countries . Federal agencies gather and compile facts concerning market conditions abroad , price movements , changes in volume and costs of foreign production , imports and exports of many countries , currency movements , new foreign legislation concerning patents , trade-marks , embargoes , and tariffs , rules governing commercial travelers , and many other matters . The Department of Commerce and the Department of State co-operate in gathering this information . The Department of Agriculture also collects data on foreign markets for American agricultural products . A government may follow the policy of free trade , under which practically no taxes are collected on imported goods . This policy is based on the assumption that trade yields an advantage to both parties . Virtually everyone believes that both parties gain when Florida oranges are exchanged for Pennsylvania steel . The free trader feels the same is true of foreign trade . He is therefore unwilling to impose any but police restrictions on it . Placing an embargo on foreign trade would be the direct opposite of free trade . Nations do not often do this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The object of a tariff for revenue only is to raise money for  | governmental operations . If we had a tariff for revenue alone , moderate duties would be levied on goods not produced within the country . The primary purpose of a tariff for revenue with incidental protection is to raise money , but it has the secondary function of protecting home industries . It is placed on goods that can be produced in the home country . The tariffs imposed during the years 1789 ? 1816 and just before the Civil War might be classified under this head . Generally speaking , such tariffs are low . The purpose of a protective tariff is to minimize competition from goods manufactured or produced in other countries . If the tariff is to give real protection , the duty laid on any article must be at least equal to the difference between the cost of producing it at home and that of producing it abroad . Those who believe in a moderate protective tariff hold that it should be just equal to this difference . They argue that such rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of putting the principle into operation is that different producers in various countries have varying costs . Protective tariff duties are usually higher than the difference in costs between the most efficient producers at home and abroad . Congress passed the first definitely protective tariff measure in 1816 to keep out the goods that began to pour into this country after the close of the War of 1812 and threatened to kill off the infant manufacturing industries which had been started during the war . While we have never been entirely free of the idea of a protective tariff , it has been dominant only since 1896 . In addition to the protection of infant industries numerous other arguments have been advanced in favor of a protective tariff policy . ' It has been claimed that the protective tariff raises wages , increases employment , helps develop a home market for American agriculture , and , finally , makes national economic self-sufficiency possible . The latter is prob- ably the most significant of all the arguments for a protective tariff policy . A war cutting off access to the raw materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not developed economic independence . Our Federal Constitution gives Congress the power " to regulate commerce with foreign nations . " Congress prohibits the importation of harmful goods and taxes imports of other commodities . It also regulates shipping and determines standards to be maintained by ships flying the American flag . The Constitution , however , prohibits Congress from imposing taxes on exports . According to the Constitution tariff bills , like any other revenue bills , must originate in the House of Representatives . Otherwise , measures dealing with the tariff are enacted into law in the usual way . A very real bargaining element enters into the making of a tariff law . More varied interests are directly affected by tariff legislation than by almost any other laws . Groups that are represented at committee hearings on the proposed laws subject their senators and representatives to pressure in their own interest . If a politician expects to be re-elected , he must usually have the backing of organized business , labor , and agriculture . The bargaining of these pressure groups with their representatives and senators for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men 's bargaining over a secondhand car . Instead of threatening to buy a different car , the citizens threaten to vote for another candidate . A tariff measure must include provisions that will satisfy enough senators and representatives to pass the bill . It may be made embarrassing to a senator from a lumber state to vote against a tariff bill by increasing the duty on lumber ; his vote will thus be won , although he may dislike many other provisions of the bill . The final measure will be the result of a series of bargains among senators and representatives and of the bargains that they must make with leaders of the public in the hope of being re-elected .  | The United States Tariff Commission investigates the administration and the financial and industrial effects of our tariff laws . It also studies international tariff agreements . The administration of the tariff laws and the collection of duties rests with the Treasury Department . Collections are made through the forty-eight districts of the Bureau of Customs . The United States Customs Court and the United States Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Department of Justice . They deal with cases arising out of the interpretation of the tariff laws . For almost a decade and a half before 1934 tariff rates trended upward . The Hawley-Smoot tariff bill , passed in 1930 , raised the duties imposed on 890 different items . It affected our imports from nearly every country in the world . No other tariff bill has aroused so much hostility and bitter feeling abroad . Retaliatory measures of other countries caused American companies to establish foreign branches for the manufacture of automobiles , radio sets , machinery , aluminum ware , electrical equipment , and many other products . Rubber manufacturers of Akron , Ohio , found that they could sell more tires and footwear to Canadians by establishing plants in their country than by manufacturing the goods in this country and making it necessary for Canadians to pay import duties . With factories , mills , and assembling plants in Canada , the manufacturers had an easy entree to English markets . But the goods manufactured in Canadian plants of American firms employed Canadian labor ; thus our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act authorizing the President of the United States , without approval of the Senate , to enter into treaties with other countries for the purpose of expanding our foreign markets . Such agreements may provide for the reduction of tariff duties on specific commodities by as much as 50 per cent in exchange for concessions from foreign countries . The  | net effect of the treaties before the outbreak of the European war in 1939 was an increase of American foreign trade . Hearings are held by the State Department before a treaty is concluded . Objection to tariff reductions is always made by the groups who , rightly or wrongly , believe their interests are damaged by the importation of foreign goods . Unfortunately , anyone whose product . is in competition with foreign goods can not readily take in the total situation . When he sees that he is losing his market to foreign producers he reasons that imports are bad . If imports are stopped , however , many other markets disappear and the country as a whole is worse off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacon , but if we stop importing Canadian bacon and Canada stops importing American automobiles , tires , and farm machinery , American laborers are thrown out of work and can not buy meat . The American hog farmer is then worse off than when we were importing a little bacon . This lesson has been repeated again and again , and yet it is difficult for the individual producer to see that his own welfare may be dependent on imports , even of goods which compete with his . For the future , America will have to choose between national self-sufficiency and a trade policy permitting a rather wide exchange of goods with foreign nations . We could get along without buying from or selling to other nations if we were willing to do without certain things . A long period of adjustment would be necessary . During that period we would have to learn to produce commodities now imported or to get along without them . Labor , capital , and land that now produce goods for export would have to be applied to manufacturing or growing goods that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . In many cases that would be impossible .  | 3 .

IN primitive societies people satisfy most of their wants directly from natural resources , and there is little trading . In the exchanges that are made , goods are traded for goods , without the use of money ; these are known as barter transactions . Barter is of little importance in our industrial society today . Farmers may bring eggs or tomatoes to the crossroad store in exchange for groceries , but the value of the eggs or tomatoes is measured in money , and so is the value of the goods for which they are traded .

In a complex society , with division of labor carried out to the point where many people co-operate to make an article and it is sold to a constantly enlarging market , barter is crude , cumbersome , and inconvenient . A medium of exchange is necessary , and trading with money replaces barter . Money is defined as any commodity generally acceptable in exchange for goods and services . It is thus a standard by which the value of all other commodities is measured . Money seems to have come into use very early in the development of some cultures . Among nomadic tribes in biblical times cattle were commonly acceptable as a medium of exchange . Iron , tin , sea shells , heads of red-headed woodpeckers , walrus teeth , glass beads , copper , silver , gold , have all been used at some time or other as money . Whenever any commodity becomes generally acceptable in exchange for other goods , that commodity is money . The clumsy nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear and tear led civilized people to concentrate on the metals ; gold and silver became the favorites for use as money centuries ago . Through the ages they have circulated from hand to hand , sometimes in the form of coins , sometimes in that of dust or nuggets , sometimes in bars . The superiority of gold and silver to most substances for use as money is due to certain definite qualities : 1 . Utility and value . Both metals are much desired , because of their beauty , for decorative purposes . 2 . Indestructibility . Neither of them wears away very fast , particularly if alloyed with some other metal , and they do not rust .  | 3 . Portability . They are sufficiently scarce so that a relatively large value is not very bulky . They can therefore be easily carried from place to place . 4 . Homogeneity .

Stability . While the value of silver has changed very much during the past seventy-five years , for centuries before that it had high stability . Gold has probably been the most stable in value of all metals . This does not mean that it has not fluctuated at all . Money is used for many purposes , of which the following are the more important . The medium of exchange consists of all those things that are generally acceptable in exchange for goods . In the modern world , people exchange their services or their products for money , with which they buy what they want . A standard of value is a commodity in terms of which the value of other commodities is measured and expressed . Money is a measure or common denominator of value . A dollar is a certain amount of gold , determined by law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other commodities , but it has a high degree of stability in comparison with almost any other one commodity . We have therefore learned to measure the value of other things by the value of the dollar . In consequence of being our standard of value , money becomes a standard of deferred payments . Payments of obligations due in the future are almost universally stated in terms of money .  | Money serves as a basis for bank credit . Banks create deposits by lending much more money than they have at any one time . ( See pages 258-259 . ) By virtue of being a standard of value , money serves as a means of savings . Most commodities will deteriorate over a period of time . Money can be hoarded for future use or it can be deposited in a bank , with the assurance that the same amount can be recovered . The commodity that is the standard of value in any par , titular country constitutes standard money . In the United States the gold dollar is our standard money . While the gold dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger gold pieces were available for hand-to-hand use up to 1933 . Since that time they have been withdrawn from active circulation and reduced to bullion . The gold dollar up to March , 1933 , contained 25.8 grains of standard gold ( 9/10 fine ) or 23.22 grains of pure gold ; this meant that an ounce of gold ( 480 grains ) was worth $20.67 . Under the Gold Reserve Act of January , 1934 , the Treasury fixed the price of gold at $35.00 an ounce . The weight of a gold dollar was thus fixed at 15 5/21 grains of standard gold , or 13.71 grains of pure gold . All money except standard money or gold bullion is fiduciary money .

Silver coins consist of ( 1 ) standard silver dollars weighing 412.5 grains , of which one-tenth is alloy ; and ( 2 ) fractional silver coins ; namely , fifty- , twenty-five- , and ten-cent pieces . The intrinsic value of silver money may be equal to its face value , but during the past sixty years or more the value of the silver in the silver dollar has almost always been worth a great deal less than the face value . Fractional silver coins contain less silver in proportion to their face value than the silver dollar . The intrinsic value was cut : down to prevent its being profitable to melt them down and sell the bullion in case the intrinsic value should ever exceed the face value . Nickels and pennies consist almost entirely of copper . Their intrinsic value is very small compared with their face value . Paper money makes up a large percentage of our medium of exchange . It can be more conveniently handled , transported , or stored than gold or silver . Gold coins wear down with use ; paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paper money has certain disadvantages . Fire makes a total loss of it ; it can not be used in international transactions ; and there is constant danger of overissuing it , particularly in times of war or other emergency . When too much paper money is issued , prices go up and the whole economic system is upset . This feature of paper money will be discussed more fully in Chapter 18 . There are two varieties of paper money . Representative money consists of receipts for metallic money or bullion and circulates in place of the metals themselves . The bills are issued by the Treasury and are obligations of the Federal government . Silver certificates are receipts for silver in the Treasury . Most dollar- and many five- and ten-dollar bills are silver certificates . Formerly gold certificates , receipts for gold on deposit in the Treasury , were in common circulation , but they were withdrawn in 1933 . Except for those not yet turned in , they are now in the hands of the Treasury or the Federal Reserve Banks . The second sort of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government or by banking institutions authorized by the government .  | It takes the form of a promise to pay a certain sum on demand . Normally it is secured by standard money in the Treasury or in the bank that issues it , but usually this security is not equal to the amount of credit money outstanding . United States notes or greenbacks were originally issued by the government during the Civil War in order to finance the war . Originally they were not secured by gold or silver , but were governmental promises to pay ; later they were made redeemable in gold . There is about $346,000,000 in greenbacks outstanding . Federal Reserve notes , issued by the twelve Federal Reserve  | Checks serve the same purpose as money . They are accepted in exchange for goods or services , and are used in nine-tenths of all payments . Metal and paper money serve as the small change of business . Banks , make up an important part of our medium of exchange . These notes are ordinarily issued against ( 1 ) gold certificates ; ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short- term securities such as drafts and notes arising in current commercial , industrial , or agricultural transactions . At least 40 per cent of the security must in ordinary times be in form of gold certificates . During most of the history of the Federal Reserve System the gold has been well in excess of the minimum requirement . In addition to the pledge of specific security , the Federal Reserve notes are obligations of the Federal Reserve Banks and also of the Federal government . Federal Reserve notes constitute approximately two-thirds of all the money in circulation in our country . They give elasticity to our currency , for they can be issued  | when more money is needed and can be taken out of circulation when money is plentiful . The nature of Federal Reserve notes will be better understood after the discussion of the Federal Reserve System . ' Our Constitution gives Congress the power to coin money , to regulate its value , and to punish counterfeiting and prohibits the states from coining or issuing money . Congress regulates carefully every detail of the issuing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money we receive is worth its face value . From time to time certain kinds of money have been declared legal tender ; that is , they must be accepted by creditors in payment of debts . Formerly some types of money were not legal tender , but since 1933 all forms of money have been legal tender for the payment of all debts , public and private . The Treasury issues statements showing the amount of each kind of money outstanding , as well as reports concerning production , consumption , and prices of gold and silver . It has charge of the printing of paper money as well as the production of coins . Coinage is said to be free when the citizen may take bullion to the mint and have it coined into money ; if the government makes no charge for coinage , it is said to be gratuitous . Coinage of gold and silver was free during the early years of our history . Later , until 1933 , only the coinage of gold was both free and gratuitous . Under its constitutional power to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time redefined the stand- and of value . Bimetallism , which it first adopted , is a monetary system in which the standard of value is defined as a certain quantity of either of two metals and under which the government reserves the right to redeem other money in either of the metals at its own option . In the infancy of our Federal government , Congress made both gold and silver standard money . Both metals were coined freely and were legal tender . Congress defined the silver dollar as fifteen times as heavy as the gold dollar . Fifteen and a half ounces  | of silver were needed to buy an ounce of gold in the open market at that time , and since the mint accepted fifteen ounces of silver as the equivalent of an ounce of gold , everyone who had silver took it to the mint to be coined . Gold coins disappeared from circulation . In 1834 Congress redefined the standard of value and changed the ratio of silver to gold to sixteen to one . People then took gold to the mint and melted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The disappearance of gold from circulation before 1834 and the disappearance of silver after that date was in accordance with Gresham 's law that when two kinds of money circulate in a country the money which the mint overvalues tends to drive the undervalued money out of circulation . During the critical years from 1861 to 1865 , the Federal government was forced to issue irredeemable paper money , known as greenbacks . It was not until 1879 that the country returned to the gold standard . In 1873 Congress enacted a new coinage law which omitted the silver dollar from the list of coins to be minted , since little silver had been brought to the mint since 1834 . The bimetallic system created in 1789 and revised in 1834 had remained on the statute books , but was to all intents and purposes a dead letter . Rich silver mines were now discovered in the West , and several European countries reduced the silver requirements of their monetary systems . The increase in supply and decrease in demand caused silver to fall in price until its price in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before 1873 . Bimetallism then became a political issue . A long and bitter political discussion of the gold and silver problem followed . The question was finally settled in favor of the single gold standard in the election of 1896 . By the Currency Act of 1900 , the United States became a monometallic country , legally on the gold standard . The question of bimetallism was settled until the early years of the great depression . As a result of gold hoarding an act passed by Congress in 1933 empowered the President to require all gold to be paid into the Treasury and also to require the Treasury not to pay  | out any gold . This act took us off the gold standard , but there was little chance of re-establishing bimetallism . Later Congress , by resolution , provided that " all obligations , governmental and private , expressed to be payable in gold , may be paid dollar for dollar in legal tender . " As a result of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 , gold no longer circulates from hand to hand . Citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must get special permission from the Treasury . The government sells gold to settle trade balances with other countries and to maintain the value of the dollar in terms of other money . This arrangement may be called a limited gold bullion standard . Because of the reduction in the weight of the standard gold dollar the gold bullion held by the Treasury became worth $2,500,000,000 more than before March , 1933 . Most of this profit was made available to the Treasury for use as a stabilization fund to regulate the value of the dollar in foreign markets . On the insistence of representatives from the western states , Congress enacted some legislation favorable to silver . The Secretary of the Treasury was directed to buy silver in order to increase the proportion of that metal in our monetary reserve . Owners of silver bullion were required to turn their stocks over to it at a fixed price . The price of silver was stabilized at a point well above its previous market price .

If so , were you able to get it ? What rate of interest was asked ? Was this rate higher than you felt it should be ? Are lending agencies meeting the needs of your community adequately ? What is the prevailing local rate of interest charged on small loans ? THE great majority of our daily financial transactions do not involve the use of money . They are credit transactions . Credit is the ability to obtain money , goods , or services on the promise of future payment . If a bank or an individual lends money , or if a merchant sells a coat today to be paid for next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either case the privilege of paying in the future is extended  | because the individual has proved himself honest , or because he has property that he can put up as a basis for the loan , or because he has an earning capacity that will enable him to repay the loan . Credit is granted on the basis of confidence in a person 's character , capacity , and capital , the three C 's of credit . Credit may be classified as commercial , investment , and personal or consumer . Commercial credit is short-time credit for financing ordinary day-to-day business transactions . It is typically granted by commercial banks for periods of thirty , sixty , or ninety days ? never for more than a year . Investment credit consists of long-time loans to provide permanent capital for business or agriculture . Such loans run from a few years to a century or even longer . Generally speaking , the length of time is governed by the length of life of the property acquired with the loan . Personal or consumer credit , for financing consumption of goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and a half . Retail stores typically give credit for thirty days , while a year and a half may be the term for completing payments on an automobile on the installment plan . He that buys upon credit pays interest for what he buys . And he that pays ready money , might let that money out to use ; so that He that possesses anything he has bought , pays interest for the use of it . Consider then , when you are tempted to buy any unnecessary household stuff , or any superfluous thing , whether you will be willing to pay interest , and interest upon interest for it as long as you live . ? Benjamin Franklin , Poor Richard 's Almanac . People often experience the necessity for more ready cash than what they have . When a person has securities ?  | stocks and bonds ? he may sell them or he may go to a bank and borrow money on them ; in that case the securities are collateral for the loan . If he has shares in a building and loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the association , with the shares as security . If he has a life insurance policy , he may borrow from the life insurance company , and his policy will then secure the loan . But many people do not have any such assets . They have only their character , their household goods , or their future wages as security for a loan . That consumers need a great deal of credit is shown by the fact that the total amount granted during a recent year was estimated at $14,000,000,000 , not counting loans on insurance policies or from friends or relatives . Most individual borrowers are earnest , industrious people , seeking money to meet such emergencies as death , sickness , accident , or unemployment , or for such items as taxes , repairs on homes , or their children 's educational needs . Business requirements , mortgage payments , and aid to needy relatives are other important occasions for borrowing . People of all sorts , apparently , borrow from various types of loan agencies ? skilled and semi-skilled laborers , office and clerical workers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers , school teachers , as well as city , state , and Federal employees and others . For years people who were in need had only the loan shark to help them . Poor people paid anywhere from 36 to 1,700 per cent a year for the small sums they borrowed . Rates varied from city to city , but the lender 's mind was always occupied with the question : How much can I get ? Constant agitation has improved the situation , but it is still far from ideal . To meet the needs of individual borrowers , the following types of legitimate organization are now in existence .  | The loan shark is being driven out of business by small-loan companies . A reduction in interest rates has been brought about largely by the enactment of small-loan laws in a majority of the states . These laws generally provide that a state license shall be obtained to make loans at more than the existing legal interest rate . Licensed lenders may make loans up to $300 .

These personal finance companies obtain the money that they lend out either from their stockholders or from loans from commercial banks or other sources . They lend close to $500,000,000 a year . Contracts drawn up when the loans are granted usually provide for monthly or weekly payments . These companies take into consideration the character and reputation of the applicant and his income , property , and other resources . They can afford to lend only to people who are decent , steady , sober , and honest . In order to repay the loan the borrower must have some property or at least a job in which he earns enough to make the monthly payments . Recommendations are usually asked from employers , so that the lender can be reasonably certain that the borrower is going to continue in his job . A pawnbroker makes loans on personal property deposited with him . If the loan is not repaid at a certain time he has the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licensed , but also bonded . Most states regulate interest rates and the sale of unredeemed articles . Interest rates vary from 12 to 120 per cent a year . Money is lent by industrial banks to people who are able and willing to get indorsers , generally two in number , who will act as co-makers of the loans and who will therefore share with the borrowers the responsibility of repayment . These institutions usually charge 6 to 8 per cent interest , deducted from the loan when it is granted . In addition they collect a service charge of 2 to 3 per cent , which takes care of the cost of investigating the applicant and indorsers . Loans are usually repayable in fifty weekly installments . For example , on a loan of a hundred dollars the borrower gets $92 if the rate is 6 per cent and the service charge 2 per cent ; he repays it at the rate of two dollars a week for fifty weeks . The actual interest charge is thus more than 17 per cent a year .  | All over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-operative savings and loan institutions have been organized within groups such as employees of a business or members of a church , lodge , or labor union . The group who organize such a credit union pay in their savings for stock and make loans to members at a reasonable rate . ( See page 325 . ) Members receive interest , usually of 4 to 6 per cent a year , on deposits ; the interest rate paid by borrowing members is usually higher , 1 per cent or of 1 per cent a month . The difference in interest rates serves to offset losses and to pay expenses . The credit union has generally proved very efficient , and losses have been small , due largely to intimate knowledge of the borrowers . Only members may borrow from a credit union . To be a member it is necessary to subscribe to at least one share of stock , whose par value may be five or ten dollars .

The charter of a credit union is usually granted by the banking department of the state , which also supervises its transactions . A yearly business averaging almost $150 for every family in the country is done by installment finance companies . Most retailers do not have enough money to pay cash for goods that they will sell on the installment plan . Companies are organized to take over contracts for installment sales from retailers and wholesalers and turn over to them the sum they would have collected over a period of time . These companies take on themselves the collecting of payments from  | the buyer .

Small borrowers without collateral security may obtain money from the personal loan departments of commercial banks . The obligation is formally acknowledged by the borrower in a note , for which co-signers or indorsers are usually required . The maximum limit of such loans is generally $500 to $1,000 .

Why ? What differences do you notice between banks in your community ? How would you determine the soundness of a bank ? What services have banks performed for your family or friends ? How would your community be inconvenienced if it had no banks ? THE business done by banks consists primarily of receiving deposits and extending credit . Money hidden in a mattress or buried in an old tin can may be stolen . It is generally wiser to take idle money to a bank , where it is safer and can do others some good . Banks must have deposits of cash if they are to make loans to individuals and businesses that need money to carry on their activities . In extending credit to those who need it , banks serve a public purpose .  | Money deposited in a hank in the expectation of leaving it for a considerable time is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the expectation of drawing it out soon to spend it , a checking account is used . Commercial banking , which consists of making short-term loans and conducting checking accounts , is frequently said to he the heart of modern industry . It is to be contrasted with investment banking and savings banking , which deal almost entirely with long-time credit . The latter institutions will be discussed in Chapter 19 . Private banking is perhaps the oldest form of banking , and some of the most powerful banking concerns in the world have been unincorporated private institutions . They are distinguished from incorporated banks in being conducted as individual or partnership enterprises . The tendency has been toward the incorporation of private banks . Only a few score private banks remain in existence in this country . No more can be started . In most states public regulation has been extended to private as well as to incorporated banks . National banks are incorporated under the laws and regulations of the national government and are subject to its supervision . State banks receive their charters from the state government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit banks to be organized with less capital than is required of national banks . Greater freedom is generally allowed to state banks than to national banks in making loans on real estate , and lower cash reserves are usually permitted to them than to national banks . Because banks are very important in our society , they are subject to government regulation . Governmental agencies make careful investigations to determine whether a proposed  | bank is necessary or will serve a public purpose before they grant a charter . Both national and state banks undergo periodic examinations . National banks are under the supervision of the Comptroller of the Currency . State banks are examined by the department designated for that purpose by the laws of the particular state . If state banks belong to the Federal Reserve System , they are subject to virtually the same regulations as national banks . Bank examinations serve as a safeguard against unsound practices . They protect depositors by helping banks to keep their loans and investments in such form that they are convertible into cash within a reasonable time . State and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in reserve in case of heavy withdrawals of deposits . Rates of interest which may be paid on deposits are also regulated . Examiners make certain that banks obey the laws . Public confidence in our banking system as a whole is promoted by such examinations and by published reports . Issues of Federal Reserve notes are controlled by the Federal government . Since 1933 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has insured deposits of banks that affiliate with it . ( See page 282 . ) Such banks are examined by and are subject to the rules and regulations of the corporation . Thus governmental regulation of banking is extensive . The justification of such regulation lies in the close relationship between the welfare of banking and the general welfare . Commercial banking has sometimes been compared with an electric dynamo . Just as a dynamo makes possible the operation of an endless number of electric motors and other machines , so banks make possible a highly complicated system of buying and selling goods and services . A simple illustration will show the reason . Retailers sell a large proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for consumers to buy before they have earned the money to pay . But the retailer is also a buyer ,  | and he needs cash to pay wages to his employees and to pay wholesalers and manufacturers . Frequently the latter allow a discount if the retailer pays cash . The bank advances credit to the retailer , who can then pay his help and pay for the goods he has purchased . Wholesalers and manufacturers are in the same position as retailers ; they too have obligations to employees and to those who sell them goods . Wholesalers and manufacturers are able to extend credit to retailers because banks lend them money until retailers are able to pay . All sorts of businesses borrow from banks at one time or another . In some businesses seasonal demand is large ; toys , for example , are sold most heavily during the six weeks before Christmas . But those toys must be manufactured long before . Workers have had to have their wages , and other companies have been paid for materials furnished , many months before the retailer sells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on have been made by banks in expectation of the sales that retailers would make months afterward . Although frequently not classified as businessmen , farmers find banks necessary to their operation A. Banks advance them money for purchasing machinery , equipment , supplies , feed , and seed and for paying hired help . The principles that apply to buying and selling goods also apply to loans . Borrowers try to pay as little interest as possible , while banks try to get at least a reasonable interest rate . When few people want loans , banks have little bargaining power and rates of interest are likely to be rather low . When the demand for loans is large , banks can get higher rates . The forces of demand and supply operate in connection with bank loans just as they do in connection with the prices of any other goods or services . Commercial banks draw their deposits from two sources : ( 1 ) Their customers bring in checks and money to be deposited to their accounts , and ( 2 ) when the bank makes a loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the  | books of the bank . The credit extended by the bank serves in place of actual money . In fact , the banks have the power to increase the amount of the medium of exchange by granting credit against which people can write checks just as if they had deposited cash . This power of the bank to create present purchasing power on the basis of the borrower 's future expected profits is tremendously important . Banks are in business for the primary purpose of lending money to honest and reliable people whose earning capacity is such that they can repay it . A bank , when it is commencing operations , lends the money paid in by stockholders for shares of its stock . If borrowers were to take loans only in cash , it is obvious that until it received cash deposits , the bank could lend no more than had been paid for capital stock . Borrowers , however , are likely to prefer credit on the books of the bank to money . In consequence the bank can lend much more than cash on hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basis for further loans , many of which in turn are left on deposit . The banks can lend more money than they have on hand , but they must keep a certain amount of cash or deposits in other banks as a reserve , so that if depositors want to withdraw money they can be satisfied . Usually the required reserve is stated as a percentage of the amount of deposits . The loans made by a commercial bank are typically shorttime loans because the bank 's deposits are payable on demand . These loans may be classified by the length of time for which they are made , as demand , thirty- , sixty- , or ninetyday , or six-month loans . They may also be classified as secured and unsecured . Secured loans may be further classified by the security 's consisting of goods on hand or in warehouses , stocks , bonds , or real estate . Long-time loans made by commercial banks are almost entirely such as can be readily sold in the open market , so that the bank can turn them into cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a particular person can borrow on his unsecured note or must pledge some property as security depends on his credit standing . That is , the bank , like any other lender , judges the applicant 's character , capacity , and capital and decides whether it is wise to lend on an unsecured note . A bank may often regard a prospective borrower as an excellent credit risk and yet expect him to deposit collateral , simply because he has the collateral and might as well deposit it with the bank and thus make repayment of the loan doubly certain . The bank can not afford to lose much on the loans it makes , for depositors will expect it to pay out every dollar of deposits on demand ; if the bank can not do that it is insolvent . ' Any one of four different kinds of banking transaction may take place when people use banks in paying for goods or services . Both buyer and seller may live in the same city and patronize the same bank . In this case the buyer , A , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X. The bank gives B the cash or else a deposit credit on its books . In either case , Bank X subtracts the amount of the check from A 's account and returns the canceled check to him at the end of the month . Both the buyer and the seller may live in the same city , but the buyer 's check may be on a different bank from that in which it is cashed or deposited . In this case A gives B a check on Bank X. When B takes the check to his bank , Y , the bank takes the check to the clearinghouse ( see page 264 ) and turns it over to Bank X. Bank X subtracts the amount of the check from A 's account , and the canceled check is returned to A at the end of the month . Bank X gives Bank Y checks that were drawn on Y and cashed by X , or it may pay Y by a draft on New York or some other city , or it may turn over the actual cash to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country may use checks or drafts to pay for services purchased from each other . A Buffalo commission man may send a check to pay for a carload of lettuce purchased from a Denver dealer . The Denver seller may deposit the check in his bank or withdraw the cash . The Denver bank sends the check on to New York to its bank , from which it is sent to Buffalo . Between the time when the Denver man deposits his check and the time when the check gets back to Buffalo and is charged to the account of the buyer , the bank in Denver has really advanced credit to the Denver merchant . Sometimes a draft or trade acceptance is used instead of a check . The draft differs from the check in being drawn by the seller rather than the buyer , and it is usually drawn on  | the buyer rather than on a bank . In the illustration given , the seller in Denver might have drawn a draft on the Buffalo commission man , attached the bill of lading received from the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers to his bank in Denver . The bank would give him a large part of the value of the lettuce long before the car reached Buffalo . It would then have title to the lettuce and would pass this on to the New York bank , which in turn would pass it on to the Buffalo commission man through a Buffalo bank . Credit would thus have been granted by the Denver bank on the security of the bill of lading . Later the Buffalo bank would have granted credit to the commission man if it permitted him to get possession of the lettuce before paying for it . In that case he would have been expected to pay the bank as soon as he sold the lettuce and received payment for it himself . How do the New York and Denver banks get paid ? The New York bank charges the account of the Buffalo bank , and the Denver bank receives credit on the books of the New York bank . The former may write checks against this credit , and when customers of the Denver bank buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks will be charged against the account of the Denver bank in New York before the checks are sent back to Denver . Instead , the Denver bank may sell a bank draft against its New York bank , to be used by a customer instead of his check in paying for goods bought outside of Denver . Arrangements like that just sketched make possible the transfer of ownership in great quantities of goods without handling money . Credit extended by a bank takes the place of money . If any one section of the country has too little money and its banks have large deposits in other places ? in New York , for example ? it may be necessary to ship cash to the community that needs more money . As a matter of fact , very little money is shipped . Slightly more complicated transactions are made in paying for goods purchased or sold across national boundary  | lines . They make up what is known as foreign exchange . A draft used in foreign exchange is ordinarily referred to as a foreign bill of exchange . International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same principles and in much the same way as domestic transactions in which domestic bills of exchange are used . Since the money of one nation is not commonly acceptable to other nationalities , balances between different countries are finally settled in gold , the only medium accepted everywhere . Bankers sometimes collect money for depositors who have trouble in getting out-of-town customers to pay their bills . This is done by drawing a sight draft on the creditors and sending it to another bank for collection . Many commercial banks act as trustees , executors , or administrators of estates . They may also act as guardians of minor heirs . In these capacities they handle a great deal of money . They make investments , pay out income , manage properties , and do other work for persons who are beneficiaries of trusts or estates . For such services a fee is charged . The banker is the first to be consulted when a business is organized , and he must often take part in its final liquidation . From such experiences he learns much . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in helping them solve their financial problems . A bank statement , like the statement of any other business , is divided into two parts , assets and liabilities . Assets are the notes , bonds , mortgages , buildings , cash , amounts due from other banks , and other things owned by the bank . On the liability side appear the items that the bank owes . Most of the money is owed to depositors . The difference between the amount that the bank owns and the amount that it owes is the value of the business or , we might say , the interest of the proprietors . This value is made up of the  | amount paid for the capital stock plus the money that the bank has earned in excess of dividends paid to the stockholders since its organization . Capital stock , surplus , and undivided profits will be found on the liability side of a financial statement . They are not liabilities , but they show what the interest of the proprietors really amounts to . When capital stock , surplus , and undivided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liability side of the balance sheet and that of the asset side are exactly the same . A bank 's reserve consists of cash in the vaults and money due from other banks . This is the amount with which the bank can meet demands of depositors . The reserve is required by law to amount to a certain percentage of deposits , but it needs to be larger than this to enable the bank to carry on its business . Every transaction affects the bank statement . Either the nature of the assets changes or that of the liabilities , including capital items ; or both assets and liabilities increase or decrease by an equal amount . Bank statements are issued at regular intervals so that the public may know the nature of the bank 's business and see what changes take place from time to time .

It performs such other services as may be agreed upon by its members and are not in contradiction to state or Federal laws . These are called non-clearing functions . a . The clearinghouse banks may establish a credit bureau where duplicate borrowing by individuals from banks may be checked . b . Co-operative examinations of individual member banks may be carried on .

Even the smallest bank carries a deposit account with some bank in a larger community , which in turn carries one with a bank or banks in still larger communities . The great mass of our banks carry balances in New York , Chicago , or San Francisco , and most of the larger banks maintain balances in more than one city . The relationship that results from banks ' having deposits in other banks is referred to as a correspondent relationship . The larger city bank has the use of funds kept on deposit in it by the smaller bank . The smaller banks sell drafts drawn on the banks in the larger cities . They also use the correspondent bank as a means of collecting drafts or notes that may be due them or their customers from persons in the city where the correspondent is located , and they may also borrow from it .

Group banking is the ownership and control of a number of separately chartered banks by a holding company . Member banks operate as independent units , and the holding company is usually formed by interests connected with one or more of the principal banks of the system . Group banking has become popular in some states that prohibit branch banking . Ever since the days of Andrew Jackson , many American  | people have been suspicious of branch banking in any shape . During recent years there has been a change in the law governing the establishment of bank branches . National banks may now establish branches within those states that permit their state banks to operate branches , and under similar terms . About a dozen states prohibit branches altogether , while about twenty permit state-wide branch banking . More than 15,000 of our banks do not have branches .

THE Federal Reserve System was established in 1913 to remedy defects of banking machinery and to modernize the banking system so that it could meet the needs of modern business . The act has been amended several times in order to make it function more smoothly . The most important amendments came in 1933 and 1935 , after the bank holiday of 1933 . For the purposes of the Federal Reserve Act , the country  | was divided into twelve districts , in each of which a Federal Reserve Bank was established . These banks are located at Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta , Chicago , St. Louis , Minneapolis , Kansas City , Dallas , and San Francisco . Other cities have branches and agencies . Each Federal Reserve Bank is a corporation owned by banks in its district that are called member banks . National banks must become members of the Federal Reserve System , and state banks , trust companies , industrial banks , and mutual savings banks are permitted to join it . The twelve Federal Reserve Banks are really bankers ' banks . They give other banks services similar to those rendered by those banks to individuals . Member banks deposit money in the Federal Reserve Bank , borrow from it , and send checks and drafts to it for collection . There are more than 6,000 member banks . About 85 per cent of these are national banks . These 6,000 banks represent about 40 per cent of all the banks in the United States and hold about 65 per cent of all bank deposits in the country . In order to become a member of the Federal Reserve System a bank must meet certain requirements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the city in which they do business . Deposits may not be more than ten times the amount of capital stock , surplus , and undivided profits . A surplus must be set up equal to at least 20 per cent of the capital stock . This fund is built up until it equals the capital stock , by adding each year 10 per cent of the net earnings ; that is , earnings that remain after deducting expenses . State laws frequently do not require state banks to abide by these rules , but if a state bank wants to join the Federal Reserve System it must conform to the regulations controlling the national banks . Member banks are required to subscribe to an amount of stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of their district equal to 6 per cent of their capital and surplus . Up to the present only 3 per cent of this amount has actually been paid for ; the remaining 3 per cent may be demanded at any time . The law provides that member banks must keep a minimum  | percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This constitutes the member banks ' legal reserve . Country banks must have 7 per cent of their demand deposits on deposit with their Federal Reserve Bank , reserve city banks 1 10 per cent , and the banks of New York and Chicago at least 13 per cent . In addition , all banks must have on deposit an amount equal to 3 per cent of their time deposits , which need not be paid immediately on demand . These percentages may be doubled by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System . As this book is being written , the required reserves are double the minimum . Changes may be made on short notice . At the head of the Federal Reserve System is the Board of Governors , or Federal Reserve Board , with headquarters in Washington , D. C. This board consists of seven members appointed by the President of the United States for a term of fourteen years . In making appointments , the President is required to have due regard for the different commercial , industrial , and geographical divisions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may come from any one Federal Reserve district . Salaries are $15,000 a year . No member may serve more than one term . The board determines policies for the twelve banks . It fixes the rates that they may charge for loans and the reserve requirements for member banks , within the limitations indicated above . The issuance of Federal Reserve notes is regulated by it , and it may call on one Federal Reserve Bank to lend to another . It has the power to examine any bank in the system and may suspend officers of any Federal Reserve Banks . It carries on research into the problems of banking , particularly as they affect the Federal Reserve System , and much statistical material is published in a monthly bulletin . The board is assisted by a Federal Advisory Council of twelve members appointed by the member banks , one from each district .  | The council meets in Washington at least once every three months to consult with the board about financial and business conditions , banking practices , and other matters . Each of the twelve Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom are bankers elected by the member banks ; three representing commerce , agriculture , and industry are also elected by the member banks , and three are appointed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to represent the public interest . One of these last acts as chairman of the board of directors and has the title of Federal Reserve Agent . The Federal Reserve System has given elasticity to our currency and credit . Member banks may send to the Federal Reserve Bank of their district commercial paper ? that is , notes and drafts ? representing loans that they have made to their customers . The Federal Reserve Bank discounts this commercial paper , deducting interest charges and depositing the proceeds to the account of the member bank . The member bank can then make further loans , because it can get cash on demand from its account in the Federal Reserve Bank . The rediscount rate charged to its members by the Federal Reserve Bank is lower than the rate at which local banks lend to their customers . If customers of member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the banks may draw on their own deposits in the Federal Reserve Bank for cash . When demands for cash become so heavy that there is a shortage of money , the Federal Reserve Bank may turn over to the Federal Reserve Agent some of the rediscounted paper and gold certificates that it holds , in exchange for Federal Reserve notes which it pays out to the member banks .  | Banking and business are thus provided with the credit and cash they need by the rediscount and note-issuing powers of the Federal Reserve Banks . When business activity is slight , not many new loans are made by banks . During such times member banks deposit their surplus cash and out-of-town checks with their Federal Reserve Bank in order to build up their account so that they can repay their loans . When a loan comes due , the member bank merely notifies the Federal Reserve Bank to charge its account with the amount of the note . The note is then returned to the member bank for collection . If the borrowing bank has not built up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged against it , it may send the Federal Reserve Bank other commercial paper or government bonds to take the place of the note or draft that has come due . If the Federal Reserve Bank finds that it has a surplus of cash , Federal Reserve notes are taken out of circulation . The bank can do this because when there is more money in the country than is needed the surplus is shipped to the Federal Reserve Bank . Federal Reserve notes can thus be decreased as well as increased in amount . That is what elasticity of money and credit means . Reserves are used more efficiently than before the establishment of the Federal Reserve System . Formerly it was necessary for a bank to have a percentage of its deposits in the form of cash in its vaults . Instead of large quantities of money locked up in bank vaults , legal reserves now consist of deposits in the Federal Reserve Bank ; they can be built up by rediscounting or by money deposits . Thus a large amount of money is not kept out of circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government funds ( money received from taxes and other sources ) are deposited in the Federal Reserve Banks . Outside of funds that are kept in the Treasury in Washington , D. C. , all Federal government money can be readily used for the needs of business , industry , and agriculture . The Federal Reserve Banks render a very important service in the clearing and collection of checks . Banks may send to the Federal Reserve Bank all the checks on out-of-town banks that they have cashed ; the Federal Reserve Bank then sends the checks out to the individual banks and collects the proceeds . Over 80 per cent of the banks in the country ,  | including virtually all the larger banks , have agreed to remit to the Federal Reserve Bank the amount of the checks sent to them by it ; this arrangement includes the vast majority of banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System . It is possible to collect , at very small cost and with minimum loss of time , millions of dollars each day from banks far distant from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared by being sent to correspondent banks ( see page 266 ) . Whether a bank uses a correspondent bank or a Federal Reserve Bank is a matter of choice . During the decade before the great depression banks paid interest on large demand deposits of banks and other businesses . There was competition among banks for such deposits , so that they often paid more than could be earned by thoroughly sound banking practices . For safety 's sake , the law now forbids member banks to pay interest on demand deposits , whether they are deposits of banks , industrial concerns , or individuals . The Board of Governors controls the interest that banks may pay on savings deposits , in order to prevent undue competition among banks , since that might lead to unsafe practices . In order to facilitate the financing of foreign trade , the original Federal Reserve Act made it possible for national banks to establish foreign branches . This is a very common practice among banks of foreign countries . In addition , national banks are permitted to accept drafts drawn on them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , can probably make an advantageous bargain if he can tell the Japanese exporter that he may make a draft for the silk on a well-known bank . The bank guarantees payment for the silk , and the foreign shipper is likely to feel more secure than if he had to depend entirely on an individual for payment . Drafts accepted by banks are known as bank acceptances . In order that there may be a ready market for  | them at all times , the Federal Reserve Banks are prepared to buy all that are offered to them . During 1921 ? 32 , more than one-third of the number of banks that had been in existence in this country in 1920 failed . Probably no other fact displays so clearly the shortcomings of our banking system . The immediate question is : Why did they fail ? Following are five important reasons . Agriculture has been in a more or less constant state of depression since 1920 . Loans made to farmers , particularly on farm land , could not , in many cases , be repaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of the businesses to which they made loans were dependent on farmers and so could not repay the loans . More than 50 per cent of hank failures between 1921 and 1931 occurred in villages with less than 1,000 population , and almost 90 per cent in towns with less than 10,000 . Changes in transportation methods caused many smalltown banks to fail . Automobiles and hard roads made it possible to drive longer distances . Small towns declined as marketing centers , and their decline was often accompanied by failures of local banks . Some parts of the country had too many banks . In 1920 there were more than 30,000 banks in the United States . Today there are scarcely half that number . During the period of prosperity many states would grant a bank charter to any group who asked for one and could sell the required minimum amount of stock . Officers of many of these banks were inexperienced . When the depression came their banks failed . The great increase in bank failures after 1929 largely resulted from loans made on excessive valuations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stock prices had  | gone to great heights by 1929 . In some parts of the country real estate was very much overvalued . When prices tumbled people could not repay their loans , and the banks went down in the crash . Loss of confidence led the public to withdraw deposits at an alarming rate . They hoarded their money , and a shortage of money in circulation followed , with more bank failures . Congress created the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in an attempt to wipe out the cause of fear and doubt . Bank failures decreased for some months , but then again increased , until on March 4 , 1933 , virtually every bank in the United States was closed . The Banking Act of 1933 and the Bank Act of 1935 were designed to overcome banking defects .  | One of the most significant functions of the Federal Reserve System is to control credit so that there will be no undue expansion with consequent price increases . The Board of Governors controls the rate at which the Federal Reserve Banks shall lend ; that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourage banks from borrowing from the Federal Reserve Banks and lending to businesses . By lowering it credit can be made easy , and if businessmen desire loans they can get them very cheaply . In order to make changes in the discount rate more effective , Federal Reserve Banks may buy or sell United States bonds . The bonds are bought from or sold to member banks . The balance of the member banks with the Federal Reserve Banks is changed by an amount equal to the value of the bonds bought or sold . Generally speaking , a purchase of bonds by the Federal Reserve Bank gives customer banks a larger balance and allows them to lend to businessmen more freely ; a purchase thus goes hand in hand with a decrease in the discount rate . On the other hand , a sale of bonds reduces the balance of the member banks and thus has the same effect as increasing the rate . Through experience during the decade before the depression , these devices were proved insufficient to insure the control of credit by the Federal Reserve Banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governors could change the legal reserves required to be kept in the Federal Reserve Banks . When reserve requirements are increased , banks have less to lend unless they borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank , and the Federal Reserve discount rate thus becomes much more effective as a device for controlling the amount of credit granted . In order to control the amount of credit used for speculative purposes the Board of Governors has the power to determine how much a member bank may lend on stocks and bonds held for these purposes . In addition , the board can influence business policies very much by issuing statements interpreting business trends .  | Recent banking legislation has extended the power of national banks to make loans on real estate , particularly homes . Many commercial banks have developed such large savings accounts that it has been thought wise to let them turn a considerable portion of these accounts into mortgages on real estate . Under recent legislation national banks are permitted to establish state-wide branches wherever state banks are allowed to . ( See page 268 . ) This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a larger bank may be able to render only very limited services and must , of course , remain under the strict supervision of a central office ; on the other hand an independent local bank may enter a wide variety of activities in which the personnel is neither trained nor experienced . There is much difference of opinion as to whether the advantages of branch banking outweigh the disadvantages . The important disadvantage is that branch banking limits the power of the people of a community to decide which community enterprises shall be aided by grants of credit . As a result of the large number of bank failures and the heavy withdrawals of deposits that brought on the bank holiday of 1933 , Congress established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to insure all deposit accounts up to $5,000 in banks which chose to insure their deposits and which complied with the rules and regulations of the corporation . More than 90 per cent of all banks now have their deposits insured . The corporation is under the control of a board of three directors , consisting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President for sixyear terms . It was capitalized by a grant of $150,000,000 from the Treasury and by a fund nearly as large taken from the surplus built up by the twelve Federal Reserve Banks . All insured banks pay assessments each year equal to 11 of 1 per cent of all deposits . More than 98 per cent of all accounts are insured , but since individual accounts are insured only up to $5,000 , this covers less than half of all deposits . The success of deposit insurance will depend on the efficiency  | with which bankers and examiners eliminate bad banking practices in their earliest stages . Deposit insurance alone would not have prevented the bank failures of 1920-33 . The most important questions in banking are still open . How far shall we permit branch and group banking to go ? Shall we gradually give up our independent unit banks and turn to a comprehensive system of branch banking ? That is what all the other highly industrialized nations have done . Or shall we reorganize our system of small unit banks so that they can render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people of the particular com-munity ? The second important question is : How far can the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System prevent credit inflation ? Can the board , with the power now in its hands , stave off such catastrophes as we suffered between 1929 and 1933 ? . Closely related to this is the question whether the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation can actually prevent such a deluge of bank failures as that of 1929-33 . These questions are interrelated with the question whether we can maintain our dual system of state and national banks and control elasticity of credit and safety for depositors . Another important problem , as this book is being written , arises from the large holdings of government bonds by banks . Such holdings have increased very much during the past decade . Does this mean that our banks are gradually losing the characteristics described in the previous chapter and are becoming vast organizations whose chief business is to hold the government debt ? Or , may they eventually primarily make long term loans to industry ? We think not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure only that it is going to be different somehow from what it has been in the past . Some critics insist that the whole business of banking should be a government function . Many of these were very much disappointed at the government 's not taking over the banks in 1933.  | Do people feel that prices are too high ? Have you ever heard anyone complain because prices were too low ? Do the wages that people are receiving today buy as many , f ewer , or more goods than they did a few years ago ? Have wages or prices gone up or down within the past few years ? How do you account for the changes in prices during recent years ? THE value of money is measured by the quantity of other commodities for which it can be exchanged . Prices of many commodities may change frequently ; during any given period , some may go up and others down . We are inclined to think of money as remaining stable in value , but as a matter of fact , the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going down in price or going up in price the value of money is changing .  | If prices in general are going up , fewer goods can be bought with a dollar ; this is another way of saying that money is worth less . If prices are going down , more goods can be bought with a dollar ; money is worth more . As the prices of all commodities do not go up or down at the same time or at the same rate , it is sometimes difficult to determine whether the average of all prices is going up or down . To measure the trend of prices and the extent of their fluctuations , index numbers are used . A price index number is an average of the prices of the selected group of commodities to be measured , compared with the average prices of the same or a similar group of commodities at a certain period of time , called the base period . Prices at any time are usually stated as percentages of those existing during the base period . If , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of food , we might proceed like this : 1 . Select the commodities that should be included and determine the quantity of each that the average family purchases . 2 . Select a base year . 3 . Secure prices of the selected commodities for the base year and for the current year .  | 4 . Multiply the price of each commodity by the quantity that the average family uses . Each commodity is thus weighted according to its relative importance . 5 . Total the results just arrived at for each year . 6 . Divide the total for the present year by the total for the base year and multiply by 100 to express as per cent . Such an index number would cover dozens of commodities . We can list only a few to show how it would work out . Such a price index can be made so as to cover all retail prices , wholesale prices , farm prices , or prices of any other group of commodities . The system of weighting used will vary as between index numbers prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are subject to supply and demand . When money and credit contract relatively to the amount of business , prices must go down , for there are fewer dollars to buy the goods and services . If , on the other hand , the use of money and credit expands without an equal increase in the supply of goods and services , prices will go up and money will be worth less . The close relationship between the amount of money and credit in use and prices of commodities makes it exceedingly important that the amount of money and credit should not be subject to anyone 's whim ; prices touch the lives of too many people . Change in prices affects different people in different ways . An increase usually makes it easier for debtors to pay their debts . They can make more money out of their businesses , or they can get more wages , and since the debts remain the same it is easier to pay them . Conversely , a decrease makes it harder to pay debts . From the standpoint of creditors , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment of a loan than was originally advanced to the borrower , but when there is a decrease they get back more purchasing power than they lent . To businessmen engaged  | in making and selling things , an increase in prices does not immediately result in a corresponding increase in costs . Long-term leases and contracts for goods and services made when prices were lower enable businessmen to buy cheaper than they otherwise could , and sell at the higher prices . On the other hand , when prices go down , these same businessmen lose money , because their long-term leases and contracts were made at higher price levels and provide for larger payments than can be made profitably at the lower level of prices . Wages do not ordinarily rise as rapidly as the cost of living . An increase in prices , therefore , makes it impossible for wage earners to buy as much as at the lower level . After a while , wages begin to catch up , and if prices go too high , wages sometimes actually go up higher than prices , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . This usually happens only in periods when prices are rising with extreme rapidity . During a period of falling prices ,  | wages usually go down more slowly than prices , and workers consequently have a larger purchasing power . When prices are falling , however , many men are unemployed , and only those who still have jobs reap any benefit from the lower prices . Even those who have jobs may be called on to support relatives who are out of work , so that the increased purchasing power of their wages does not secure a higher standard of living . Public utilities ordinarily operate at fixed rates . An increase in prices is frequently burdensome to such enterprises because income does not go up until the agencies that control them permit an increase in rates . Decrease in costs permits the utilities to make relatively more money . These generalizations are not always true , for an increase in volume of business may offset increased costs . During a period of falling prices business may fall off so sharply that despite lower costs the undertaking does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is especially likely because the utility businesses , except telephone , are usually marked by decreasing costs for every added unit of output . In short , it may be said that anyone who depends on a fixed income is likely to suffer as a result of price increases and to prosper if prices fall . Bondholders , annuitants , holders of real property who have leased their property , businesses whose incomes are fixed by law or custom , salaried workers ? all are worse off when prices rise . If prices fall , their incomes will buy more goods and they are better off . If prices fall too rapidly , however , as they did during 1929-33 , bankruptcies are likely to cause money losses to bondholders and mortgage holders and job losses to wage earners and salaried people , so that sharply falling prices really benefit very few , though they are more likely to beggar some than others . Rapidly rising prices are not very desirable either , particularly in their long-time effects . They are almost always the result of inflation , which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and credit in excess of the amount necessary for the purchase of available goods and services at the  | existing price level . When an excess of money and credit appears , goods necessarily increase in price , since the greater supply makes money worth less . Such price increases , if moderate , may be desirable , particularly when prices have been going down rapidly . Thus the increases in the general price level from 1933 to 1935 were probably beneficial . The danger of inflation is that it may go too far and prices may zoom upward . One price increase sets up other increases ,  | much as ripples result when a pebble is dropped into a pool of water . Price increases in one kind of goods result in larger costs in other fields , and so , very gradually at first and then with increasing rapidity , prices rise all along the line . People dealing in commodities the prices of which rise much less than those of other commodities are at a disadvantage . The most extreme inflation ever known in the world 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany and Russia . In both countries enormous quantities of paper money were printed and put into circulation , and the value of money went down rapidly ; that is , prices shot up . Finally the paper money of both countries was utterly worthless . Before the World War of 1914-18 , German note circulation amounted to some two and one-half billion marks , with each mark worth about $.24 . Ten years later it was 400 quintillion marks ; that is , 400 with eighteen zeros after it . Prices rose proportionately . A meal in a restaurant cost a few billion marks , and so did a taxicab ride . People in the middle class who had saved for a lifetime and invested their savings in a few bonds or mortgages found the obligations paid off with the equivalent of a half dozen eggs . People who had once believed in saving money had no reason for living within their means , for the rapidly rising prices made it easy to pay off debts as prices and incomes went up from month to month , and money that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were in a position to profit from the price increases made money so easily that it seemed folly to work , and the fundamental fact that social wealth can result only from work and effort was forgotten . The German middle class disappeared during the inflation . A study of the effects in Germany indicates that one of the most serious results of inflation is the complete loss of a sense of real values . A minor inflation does not , of course , bring with it a large proportion of the evils that come with extreme inflation such as Germany experienced in 1922 and 1923 . The same tendencies are present , however , and to a small degree many of the same evils crop out .  | Business cycles have been pointed out as characteristic of our present economic system ( Chapter 3 ) . After business activity has been vigorous for a few years , some event or series of events makes it dwindle ; a period of depression follows . After a few years , business picks up and starts again its course of ups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzed as five in number : depression , recovery , prosperity , crisis , and liquidation . At the close of a depression , prices of all commodities , both retail goods and raw materials , are low in comparison with prices during periods of prosperity . Despite low prices , people do not buy heavily . Retailers buy cautiously and keep relatively small stocks on hand . Wages have been cut , and there is much unemployment , particularly in industries making producers ' goods . Overhead costs of business have been whittled down . As a result of low wages , low material  | prices , and reduction in overhead , production costs are low and profit margins narrow . At the end of the depression there is , as a rule , plenty of money in the banks , and the total of bank loans is low . People are conservative about borrowing . Bank interest rates are low , and so are rates on first-class bonds . The fact that goods do wear out and that merchants must buy additional stocks from time to time makes profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression the government may come into Ile market to buy supplies or to construct public buildings . Low inventories , costs , and prices also prepare for the next phase . Sooner or later some businessmen believe that there is enough business ahead to warrant making expansions , buying new machinery , or possibly putting out a new product ; and the recovery phase of the cycle develops . Those who make a little money become optimistic and spend it , and this in turn generates optimism in those who profit from the spending . They , too , spend more freely . The feel- ing of hopefulness keeps on spreading . Retailers buy larger stocks of goods from wholesalers , and the latter buy larger quantities from manufacturers . Business definitely picks up . Costs are still low , so that profits go up rapidly . Unemployment has decreased , and speculation on expected price increases begins . The recovery gradually quickens into prosperity . During this phase of the cycle businessmen are highly optimistic . Prices go up and profits increase more rapidly than before . New factories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs of production higher . Soon contracts and leases have to be renewed and wages increased , and the cost of doing business goes up still more . Costs rise faster than prices . Sooner or later the higher prices meet resistance in the markets . Toward the end of the period of prosperity profits may be decreasing . The period of prosperity breeds its own end . Higher costs cut into profits . The hope of making money because prices are going up causes the accumulation of stocks of goods , but sooner or later merchants realize that prices are not going up as they had anticipated , and then they begin to reduce their stocks . Possibly they have to offer bargains ; in any case they buy less , and the crisis is at hand . Sometimes a crisis comes as a dramatic event setting off the period of prosperity from the succeeding period of liquidation . In 1929 it was the collapse of the stock market , in 1907 the failure of a large trust company , in 1920 a sharp break in commodity prices . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any case , it occurs at the point at which prosperity breaks off . From then on , businesses are intent on liquidation , that is , on paying their debts , reducing stocks , and cutting costs . This phase is marked by falling prices , dwindling stocks of goods , unemployment , shrinking , loans , and in consequence of all this , decreasing costs of doing business . Liquidation culminates in the depression phase . Debts have been liquidated to a large extent , prices are down , stocks of goods are down , employment is low , wages are low ,  | and , in general , business is in the doldrums . A gentle breeze will move the ship of business out of the doldrums , but sometimes the breeze is a long time coming . Much could be written about the social consequences of business cycles . In general , the serious social consequences are a result of the unemployment which is a phase of depression and which brings in its wake a long list of social problems ; these will be set forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business depression and infant mortality , marriage and divorce , disease , crime , and juvenile delinquency . During hard times people are likely to be undernourished , and to receive insufficient medical attention . Their physical energy is sapped , and disease results . Psychological problems may arise for people who lose all hope . Easy money almost invariably results in a misconception of true values , and for this reason prosperity as well as depression may breed serious problems . One of our greatest social needs is to learn enough about our economic system to control its excesses and to curb the fluctuations that we summarize as the business cycle . Control of credit and currency is essential to control of the business cycle . In prosperity , the resources of the country are employed productively . If banks continue to extend loans freely , overexpansion results and culminates in a crisis . I f credit is limited before overexpansion can occur , prosperity will be less marked , but depression will also be less pronounced . Much experimentation will have to be made before we shall know just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression bank credit should be used to stimulate business . Federal Reserve Banks stand ready at such times to issue more money , to lower discount rates , and to buy government securities in order to encourage business expansion . Public works might be helpful . Some students suggest that  | careful plans should be made by the government years ahead for the building of roads , dams , parks , and public buildings , so that such construction could be concentrated in depression periods . Then the government would not compete with private firms for men and materials during boom periods and thus cause the prices of both to go higher . The burden on taxpayers would be lighter in the long run , since materials and labor could be obtained cheaper during depression periods . Men would have work when they needed it most . Since 1933 the Federal government has spent billions in public works of all kinds . Much of this has been helpful in stimulating business activity , though in some instances public money was wasted for lack of careful planning . More careful interpretation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overexpansion that ultimately results in depression . If businessmen had more knowledge of prices , stocks of goods on hand , current sales , and credit and market conditions , they would be more likely to avoid overexpansion , which results from forging ahead blindly with production . Government planning for social and economic changes that care constantly proceeding is recommended . Such planning would be limited by the fact that we have a system of free enterprise , but more extensive statistical studies and more information on economic conditions may make it possible to eliminate many of the serious problems arising out of business fluctuations . Doing away with war would be enormously helpful , though also tremendously difficult . Very deep depressions like the one that began in 1929 are usually directly or indirectly aggravated by wars and resulting maladjustments. p 300 2 .

We spend great sums each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds , tobacco ,  | amusements , and countless other inessential items . Not everyone has the opportunity to enjoy these luxuries ; millions are without them . The extent to which people can have such things depends on two factors : ( 1 ) the amount of the national income ; and ( 2 ) how the national income is distributed . What is meant by national income ? The food we produce on the farm , the houses we build , the clothing and shoes we manufacture , the factories we equip to build cars and locomotives , the trips we make by railroad , steamship , or in airplanes , the services we get at hotels and barber shops , the entertainment supplied by the theater , movies , and over the radio these and millions of other goods produced and services rendered in the country during a whole year constitute our real national income . Expressed in dollars and cents , it is distributed in wages , salaries , rent , interest , and profits to the various elements of the population . How big is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1900 ? How is it distributed among consumers ? The accompanying table shows the trend of our national income since 1890.  | After making the necessary adjustments to eliminate the effects of price changes , the Brookings Institution found that the real national income , that is , the quantity of goods and services produced , increased 120 per cent between 1900 and 1929 . The decline in the national income between 1929 and 1932 was due in large part to falling prices . The real national income in 1932 was 30 per cent smaller than in 1929. l f we translate per capita income into actual goods and services , we find that in 1929 the average person had over a third more goods and services than in 1900 . In 1935 the total income , distributed among 29,400,000 families of two or more members , was $47,680,000,000 . If it had been divided equally each family would have received $1,622 . Actually it was distributed in such a way that most families received much less . The top tenth of the families received an average annual income of $5,838 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | lowest tenth received $308 per family per year . A large number of the families in the lowest tenth received less than the average of $308 per year , while many families in the top tenth received a larger income than the average of $5,838 . Nearly 38 per cent of the 24,910,000 non-relief families were families of wage earners . More than one-third of all the nonrelief wage-earning families received an income of less than $1,000 and more than two-thirds of the families received less than $1,500 . About one out of every seven non-relief wageearning families received during the 12-month period 1935 ? 36 an income of $2,000 or more . Engel 's law of consumption , which resulted from a study of the relationship between family income and expenditures , states that as a family 's income increases , the percentage spent for the necessaries of life tends to decrease , while the percentage spent for luxuries , health , education , and amusements tends to increase . Later studies seem to show that Engel 's conclusions are approximately true . Many attempts have been made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent , food , clothing , and so on , but no rule can be laid down to apply to all incomes for different-sized families in different localities , and for different years . It is only good sense for each family to spend first for the items that are necessary to maintain it in physical efficiency . Beyond that , various kinds of expenditure are of more importance to some individuals and families than to others . To one man , a better home at a higher rent may be the most desirable thing ; for another with the same income , a more modest home is good enough , and something else attracts his money . The amount spent for food , clothing , and other goods and services varies with retail prices of commodities . When the cost of food goes up , a larger proportion of a given income will probably be spent for it , and a correspondingly lower proportion for other things . Taxes on real estate , income , and  | retail sales take a substantial part of some family incomes . Goods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from year to year . If , for example , the government were to provide good housing at low rates , the amount spent for rent would be small , although that for taxes might be large . Because people live under highly various economic conditions , percentages of income can not be set for savings . The amount a family can save will depend to a large extent on earnings , current obligations , health , locality , plans for later life , and taxes . Each person must continually adjust his plans to meet new needs and circumstances . In order to have the necessaries , some comforts , and some luxuries and savings , a person must live thriftily . He must keep an accurate record of money earned and received as gifts and a record of how this money is used . He should then go one step further and construct a budget . Budgeting means planning the apportionment of income among various groups of expenses and then following the plan in spending the money . When we spend according to a budget , we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know where I 'm going , but I 'm on my way . " Budgeting shows us where our money is going . A budget may be used by an individual , a family , a school board , a business , or a city , state , or national government . Under our present industrial system we need to save ( 1 ) to help ourselves in case of emergencies , and ( 2 ) to give industry the necessary capital to expand . To be able to meet emergencies such as illness , unemployment , old age , or the needs of dependent relatives , and to be able to retire from work in any degree of comfort , people must watch carefully so that all the money they earn does not go for immediate consumption . It is easy for anyone to raise his standard of living , but painful to lower it . The productive years of the average man or woman are limited ; few earn much before twenty- frequently declines after fifty , and men and women are usually ready for retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be obtained only by being able and willing to spend less than one 's income . In order to save , a person 's income must be large enough so that he will not have to spend all he makes on necessaries . Some old  | people are poor because they were spendthrifts during their working years , but most of those who are in this condition today may thank the fact that their earnings were too meager for them to save much ; they were unable to protect themselves by accumulated savings against economic hazards and insecurity . Savings are accumulated by ( 1 ) individuals and ( 2 ) business organizations . Some individuals save because they set a high value on providing for the future , as compared with spending in the present ; others have incomes so large that they actually are not able to spend the whole and so save large sums . In a comparatively undeveloped economic community saving is almost entirely an individual matter , but in a more highly developed society much saving is accomplished by groups . Business organizations save part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , for buying additional machinery , equipment , or stock of goods . The greater part of savings in the United States today has been accumulated by corporations . There are many kinds of goods in which a businessman may invest his savings and those of others . These vary a great deal from industry to industry . In some businesses , such as steel mills or paper mills , a large proportion of savings goes into bulky things like factory buildings and machinery , and land . In other businesses , as , for instance , retail stores , savings are invested almost entirely in readily movable things like raw materials or stocks of goods that have to be constantly replaced . In most cases the value a businessman puts on a business is in direct proportion to the savings he has invested in it . As a matter of fact , the business may lose money , or it may make a great deal ; its value will then change from the amount that has actually been invested in it to some other amount , depending on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the businessman thinks of the value of his business as approximating the savings invested in it . This investment he calls his capital . Corporate savings will be discussed in the next chapter , individual savings in this chapter .  | After budgeting and saving , the question is : What shall we do with our savings ? Small investors today can seldom use savings and surplus earnings in businesses of their own . Many institutions , however , are anxious to obtain the use of savings and are willing to pay for their use a price called interest . Interest paid for the use of savings is a price and is subject to exactly the same principles as the prices of commodities . The interest rate varies with the bargaining power of the borrowers and lenders . Usually the borrower will not pay as much as he can make by using the borrowed funds , but sometimes he is in such need of the funds that he will pay almost any price for them . When numerous borrowers are bargaining for savings and the amount offered for lending is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there are few borrowers and large amounts of savings , the rate will be low . How low or how high depends on the needs of those who have money to lend and those who wish to borrow ; that is , upon their bargaining power . The maximum amount of interest that may be charged on loans is usually regulated by state law . It is amazing how money will grow when it is invested in proper securities , the principal left untouched , and the interest reinvested . If a person saves only $8.33 a month or $100 a year and invests it at 3 per cent , in thirty years he will have $4,852.07 ( $3,000 capital and $1,852.07 interest ) ; if the same money is invested at 5 per cent instead of 3 per cent , he will have $6,896.70 . Much money that is saved is invested in unfortunate ways and never returns to the saver . Because of this , all savers should learn more about investments before they put their savings into them . It is very important to differentiate between speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable risk in investing money ; the speculator hopes for more than a reasonable return through a large increase in the market value of the security . An investment has a maximum degree of safety for the money invested as well as a safe and regular return ( interest or dividend ) . Savings should go into investments , and only investments , until the saver can afford to bid his money good-bye and never shed a tear if it does not return . Many people do not make or follow a definite plan for saving . A successful program demands regularity and system . The amount to be saved should be set aside out of income before anything is spent for other purposes . Interest or dividends on investments should be reinvested . Savings should not be withdrawn for current needs except in emergencies . The desirability of investments may be graded on eight counts : safety of principal , rate of return , marketability , diversification , possible increase in value , stability , satisfactory denominations , and incentive to save . Safety of principal is essential . Tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guides . Even an inside prophecy is really nothing more than an inspired guess and may lead to financial ruin . We take plenty of time to pick out a suit of clothes or a coat that costs less than a hundred dollars , but often no time is given to selecting carefully securities in which thousands of dollars are to be invested . Freedom from anxiety is the first consideration in investing money , and only sound investments can secure it . This means careful study and application . With few exceptions , new businesses and industries are speculative , and no one should put his savings in them unless he can afford to lose . To qualify its securities as an investment , a company must have a record of successful operation and earning . In selecting an investment it is well to examine Poor 's or Moody 's Manual of Investments for the current year . These manuals  | are available in most banks and public libraries . Any reliable company will furnish statistics on its current position and recent financial history . Rate of return is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which should be paid regularly , and promptly when due . One must not , however , yield to the temptation to sacrifice safety to income . As a rule the safety limit occurs at twice the average yield of government bonds . Marketability should be great enough to make sure that at least a part of the holdings can be marketed if ready cash is needed . The constant changes in industrial conditions may cause a security that was a conservative investment at the time of purchase to become a speculative holding . Securities must be examined and re-examined . If a security is listed on a stock exchange it may be easily marketed . Diversification is a valuable safeguard . Even the shrewdest investors may make mistakes , and it is unsafe for anyone to put all his eggs in one basket . The whole of a savings fund ought not to go into railroads or public utilities or manufacturing industries , but investments should be distributed among them . If a substantial amount is to be invested , it is well to spread risks by having different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated sections . In the case of investments that carry maturity dates it is well to choose such as mature at different dates . Possible increase in value should be conservatively reckoned . Many investors hope that a business will become so prosperous that it will be able to pay them back more than they put into it . Success in this respect calls for careful study of the market , of general business conditions , and of the records of the company . If a person can not afford to lose , he should not hope to get back more than he gives ; securities that may go up may also go down . Stability of value is a highly desirable quality . Denominations of securities bought for investment should be such that the average individual can purchase them . For example , if one has $5,000 to invest , as a rule it is better to select five different $1,000 investments or ten different $500  | investments than to put the entire $5,000 in one bond . This is true , of course , only when the smaller investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people and can be found in certain sorts of investment . Regular installment payments on a savings plan are very helpful , though they may become burdensome if the payments are very large or if they have to be made over too long a period . The contracts should be drawn up in such terms that it is possible to stop payments without losing past savings . Buying real estate , especially a home , is a favorite method . In 1930 almost ten million of the thirty million families in the United States owned their homes . This seems to indicate that a larger percentage of Americans put savings into their homes than into any other sort of property . Before anyone puts his savings into urban land , he should consider carefully many points such as local and state taxes , educational facilities , municipal soundness or corruption , transportation facilities , local improvements such as gas , electricity , sewerage , the strength of local banks and other financial institutions , insurance rates , police and fire protection . It is important to make sure of clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase of farm land . In addition , there are always questions of the lie of the land , soil erosion and fertility , water supply , and , of course , climate and rainfall . Other considerations vary with the use that is being planned for the soil . In putting savings into real estate , whether for a home or for its income-yielding power , there should be no expectation of an increase in value . The days of great speculative returns from real estate are probably over , except in rare instances . It was noted in Chapter 1 that our population is rapidly becoming stationary ; consequently the basis for any rapid general increase in real estate values is disappearing , though sporadic booms in particular localities will doubtless occur .  | As an investment , real estate may be scored thus : 1 . The safety of the principal depends upon such factors as location of the land , economic conditions in the locality , increase in population . 2 . Some income-yielding real estate gives a large return to the owner ; other property yields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispose of real estate . 4 . Putting the bulk of savings into one piece of real estate means doing without the protection of diversified holdings . 5 . There is a chance for an increase in value if the property is well selected . Frequently real estate depreciates in value , and generally speaking , the average does not appreciate in value . Even if the value of the land should increase , that of the buildings is almost certain to fall . 6 . Real estate values are usually not stable over a period of years . 7 . If a definite amount is to be invested , it may be difficult to find a piece of property selling for the exact amount . 8 . There is a special incentive to save when real estate is purchased on regular payments . Government bonds , whether Federal , state , municipal , or foreign , are well regarded . The bonds are pledges of the government that taxes will be levied to pay the principal when the bonds come due and also the interest when it is due . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which means that the interest the owners receive is a net return ; very little of it has to be turned back in the form of taxes . The governments concerned are willing to pay interest on savings invested in their bonds because , by being able to carry out more extensive public works , they can give the people more efficient service much earlier than if the money were not borrowed . The rate of interest on securities of foreign governments varies , depending on the confidence that is felt in the government , as well as on the amount of surplus money seeking investment . Another possibility for investing savings where the government 's resources will protect them is found in postal savings banks . Deposits may be made through post offices .  | During recent years the total amount on deposit has been well over a billion dollars . Interest at the rate of 2 per cent is allowed . Government bonds and postal savings may be rated as follows on the eight important considerations discussed on pages 314 ? 316 : 1 . The safety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government finance .. If the issuing governmental unit should not be able to raise the necessary funds , the value of the bonds would decline . In the case of Federal government bonds or postal savings deposits , the principal is as safe as the government itself . 2 . The rate of interest on Federal government bonds is usually lower than on any other security . During 1934 ? 40 the rates on such bonds were exceptionally low . Interest on postal savings accounts was formerly considered low , but it is now equal to that on Federal government bonds . 3 . Government securities have a high degree of market- ability . Bonds of the Federal government can be turned into cash at almost any bank . Postal savings depositors can get their money at any time ; principal without interest may be withdrawn on demand , though depositors are required to give sixty days ' notice of withdrawal in order to receive full interest . 4 . All the resources of the issuing government are back of each obligation . Purchase of a government bond is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal government bonds and postal savings deposits have the widest possible diversification of resources behind them . 5 . There is no appreciation in the value of postal savings , nor in the value of government bonds if they are held to maturity . Before maturity , the market price of government bonds may be above or below the original price , depending on the supply and demand for those particular bonds on the market . 6 . Generally speaking , the value of government bonds , especially Federal government bonds , is stable , but they may fluctuate , as they did between 1918 . and 1922 . There is no fluctuation in the value of the postal savings deposit . 7 . Federal government bonds are issued in denominations from $25 to $10,000 . Postal savings deposits may range from a dollar to $2,500 . S. Federal government bonds may be purchased or deposits made in postal savings at any time . They give no particular incentive to save regularly . Savings are often lent to experienced lenders , to be lent again by them . One means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether in a savings bank or in the savings department of a commercial bank . The banks lend the money that has been deposited with them to customers offering satisfactory security such as mortgages , bonds , and other corporate securities that are legally approved . Much of the funds goes to businesses that are in need of money to make improvements and extensions and to people who want to build or buy homes or other real estate . Savings banks also buy government bonds .  | The bank charges the borrower a higher rate of interest than it pays the depositors . The difference goes to defray the expenses of the bank . Further profit goes to the stockholders or owners of the bank . In the case of mutual savings banks , the profits , after expenses have been paid , go to the depositors . Although in practice money can frequently be withdrawn on a moment 's notice , savings banks have the legal right to demand notice in advance of withdrawals . The advantages and disadvantages of the savings account as an investment may be summarized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings bank is as safe as the bank itself . There is Federal insurance on deposits up to $5,000 in the case of banks that are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . 2 . The rate of interest on savings bank deposits ordinarily used to be between 3 and 4 per cent , but during recent years it has been 2 per cent or less in many cases . 3 . The deposit can frequently be withdrawn on a moment 's notice . It can always be withdrawn after notice . 4 . Savings bank deposits are in a sense highly diversified . The banks buy a rather wide variety of bonds and mortgages . 5 . There is no appreciation in the value of a savings bank deposit . 6 . The value of the deposit does not fluctuate . 7 . Deposits of amounts over a dollar may be made at any time . 8 . There is no special incentive to save , since the depositor does not have to make deposits regularly . The building and loan association is ordinarily a co-operative organization created for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings of individuals to people who are building or buying homes . Loans are made on the amortization plan . The borrower pays a certain amount eeach month for an agreed number of months . This liquidates both the principal and the interest on the loan . Borrowing members are charged a somewhat higher rate of interest than the association pays to saving members or depositors . After expenses have been met , the remaining earnings constitute  | the profit , which is distributed to all members in a truly cooperative association , but sometimes goes to a particular class of members ; that is , the stockholders . Prospective home owners who put their savings into the associations may accumulate enough for first payments on their homes more quickly than by other methods of equal safety . Thus the associations not only make the way easy for home ownership , but also impel people to save regularly . The investment opportunity offered to stockholders and saving members or depositors by building and loan associations may be rated thus : 1 . The principal is as safe as the association . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its vicinity , one may say that savings are as safe as : ( a ) The economic status of the borrowers . If those who have borrowed from the association lose their jobs and can not obtain other work , they can not keep up their payments . ( b ) The judgment of the men who make the loans . If too much money has been lent on property and the market value drops , the association is apt to lose money . According to Section 4 of the National Housing Act , a Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation was set up , with a capital of $100,000,000 , to insure individual accounts of local building and loan associations up to $5,000 , on much the same principle as insurance on bank deposits . Local associations had to meet certain definite requirements to qualify for this protection . 2 . The rate of return in the past has generally been between 4 and 7 per cent . During the recent depression many associations cut their dividend rate . 3 . In normal times money may be freely withdrawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The money deposited with an association is lent on many homes . To that extent there is diversification , but it is one kind of investment real estate . 5 . There is no possibility of an increase in value . 6 . Stability of value is generally high . If an association  | does not fail , and few have failed , the members can take out what they put in. 7 . Usually any amount over a dollar may be paid , on a savings plan . There is some variation among building and loan associations in this respect . 8 . Incentive for saving is unusually high when members buy shares on the installment plan . When this is not done there is no more incentive to save than there is in having an account in a savings bank , except for the higher rate of return . Ordinarily , stocks are speculative . When anyone is willing to assume the risk of stocks , it is desirable to take shares in several companies , so that if one of them falls upon evil days  | everything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is unable to obtain safety of principal through distribution of risk . The idea back of the investment trust is to meet the needs of small investors in stocks . The investment trust is a corporation that buys stock in other companies and then sells shares in its own organization to the public . It may buy one or more shares in ten , fifty , a hundred , or any other number of companies . Sometimes it also buys bonds . Its profits come from interest and dividends paid by these companies . Profits are distributed as dividends to those who buy shares in the investment trust . If a person buys one share of stock in the XYZ investment trust and there are ten thousand shares , he receives one ten-thousandth of the profits . Investment trusts vary a good deal . The following statements are the nearest approach to generalizations that will apply to all of them : 1 . The principal is probably relatively safe in wellmanaged trusts if the purchase of shares is not made during a stock market boom . Some investment trusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualify as investments at all . 2 . Return depends entirely on the yield of the securities owned by the trust . 3 . Marketability of investment trust shares is good if they are listed on the stock exchanges ; otherwise they have an uncertain market . 4 . Most investment trusts hold a diversified list of stocks and sometimes also of bonds . To the extent that their holdings are restricted to stocks , the diversification does not lead to maximum security . 5 . If investment trust holdings are carefully selected , there is a real possibility of increase in value , particularly if the shares are purchased during a depression . 6 . The value of the shares of an investment trust fluctuates with the value of the underlying securities , the value of which in turn depends on the management of the particular business and on fundamental economic conditions .  | 7 . Usually shares can be purchased in small denominations . 8 . There is no special incentive to save . Credit unions are co-operative savings institutions that lend money to consumers for consumption purposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . Funds accumulated in this way are used to create credit , at legitimate rates of interest , for consumers who are in financial need . The investment rating of credit unions may be summed up : 1 . The principal seems safe . Few failures occurred among these associations during the entire depression . This was partly because loans were made only for useful purposes , partly because they were made with great care and watched over by those who made them . 2 . Savings deposited in a credit union earn a return based on the earnings of the association . Savings usually draw 5 to 7 per cent . 3 . The payments made or savings deposited are like shares in a building and loan association . They may be withdrawn at will or upon proper notice ; if funds are not on hand memhers who wish to make withdrawals must wait . 4 . The savings deposited are lent out to many members , and virtually all loans are made for consumption purposes . 5 . There is no possibility of an increase in value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 7 . Small amounts may be deposited at regular or irregular intervals . 8 . Credit unions require all borrowing members to save systematically , but not all unions urge consistent deposits by saving members . Life insurance companies offer important opportunities for investing savings and receiving in return a small rate of interest , with a high degree of protection . Life insurance companies hold a wide variety of conservative investments .

What effect has production for defense had on the industries of your community ? Have any new industries been developed ? If so , are they of permanent value ? BUSINESSMEN must pay wages and salaries . They must buy raw materials and supplies . Before a business can be started large sums of money are ordinarily necessary to purchase equipment and machinery . Besides . the money put into a business by those who start it there are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the savings of other people .  | Industries save part of their own profits . They accumulate a surplus which they apply to future developments ; that is , in expanding productive facilities . This policy in business is the same as the thrifty individual 's saving part of his earnings for future needs , advancement , and emergencies . ' The extent of business savings , that is , the sum that corporations divert from consumption and make available for investment , varies from year to year . Most businesses must obtain the use of other people 's savings if they hope to expand . They get these savings from individual savers , from savings banks , trust companies , commercial banks , insurance companies ; in fact , from any individual or business having surplus funds to invest . Stocks or bonds are given in exchange . Money taken in on the sale of stocks or bonds is generally used as fixed capital of the corporation and also supplies a part of the working capital . The rest of the working capital is raised by promissory notes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regulations governing our banking system as a whole control the amount of money that can be put at the disposal of the corporations . It is impossible to estimate at all accurately the number of people in the United States who own stocks or bonds , but it is safe to conclude that a great many people are buying them for investment as well as for speculative purposes . A holder of bonds lends his money to a corporation for a specified length of time . ( See pages 86-87 . ) A 5 per cent thirty-year bond entitles the holder to the value of the bond ( say $500 ) in thirty years and to $25 a year interest in the  | meantime . The bondholder 's interest must be paid before the stockholders or owners receive any return on their investment , in case there is not enough money to pay both . Bonds are of many classes . A mortgage bond is secured by a definite pledge of some physical property such as a home , apartment building , or office building . A collateral bond is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debenture bond is usually not secured ; it is simply a promise to pay . Businesses in search of capital offer preferred and common stocks to people who have savings to invest . ( See page 36 . ) Stocks of various kinds are issued in order to appeal to different types of investors ? not only common and preferred stocks , but several kinds of preferred stocks and even more than one class of common stock . All dividends on cumulative preferred stock , past as well as present , must be paid up before common stockholders receive anything in a given year ; noncumulative preferred stock does not receive dividends in any year during which nothing was earned toward them . In case of the liquidation or discontinuance of the business , holders of preferred stock are usually paid out of the assets of the company after the bondholders and before the common stockholders . When a business is very profitable , it is better to buy common stock in it , because dividends on that variety are not paid at a fixed rate , but increase with profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for securities ? In general , the price at which a stock becomes desirable depends on how much the company is able to earn . The price should be the expected income capitalized . For example , if the company 's profits are expected to yield four or five dollars a share , a hundred dollars may be a fair price , since 4 or 5 per cent is a fair rate of interest . If the company makes more than is expected and the earnings on the common stock go up , the market price of the stock should advance . I t will be lower , however , if the profits are less than the amount expected . Sometimes the market value of its stocks does not reflect present earning power of a corporation . If many people  | have the idea that a corporation will earn more in the future , if the stock is cleverly advertised , or if a group of financiers start concerted buying , the price may take a sudden spurt upward . Other investors , seeing the price go up , catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher still . The higher the price , the more attractive a stock appears to inexperienced persons of speculative tendencies . If the price goes to $150 and the dividend is four and a half dollars per share , the rate of return has dropped to 3 per cent . With continued speculation the price may go even higher and the rate of return lower . If , as time passes , holders of the stock feel that they are not getting a fair return on their money , they will decide to sell . This will cause the price of the stock to go down . The shrewd and experienced financiers who have sold out to the Iambs or beginners at high prices may buy back at low prices if they think the stock is worth owning . Fluctuations in the price of stock ought to represent fluctuations in earning power , but they are often due to nothing but speculation .  | The present earning power of a corporation is important , but securities should be purchased on the basis of expected earnings . To determine future earning capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points : the nature of the business itself , the character of the people managing it , the location of the plant , present and future conditions of the market served , the nature of leadership in the industry , labor conditions within the plant and within the industry , competition , probability of new technical inventions , present and prospective volume of business , political stability , legality of the particular stock issue , taxation provisions , good will of the corporation , present and possible government regulation of the business or government ownership of a competing business , money policies of the government , and many more . The long-range possibilities of the industry should interest an investor most deeply .  | The types of industry in the market for savings are commonly classified as the public service enterprises , railroads , manufacturing industries , oil and mining enterprises , and agriculture . Securities called industrials include stocks and bonds of companies manufacturing and selling a wide variety of goods including automobiles , iron and steel , machinery , rubber tires , sugar , tobacco , cod-liver oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department stores and mail-order houses . The funds needed for agriculture are secured by farmers as loans from various sources . Commercial banks lend money for short periods . The Federal Intermediate Credit Banks , cattle companies , and other finance companies furnish intermediate loans , and the insurance companies , mortgage companies , and Federal Land Banks give long-term credit . Virtually all these companies issue stocks or bonds . When the investor buys them , he is putting his savings where agriculture may make use of them . Consumers ' demands influence the value of securities . When consumers cease to want certain commodities or do not have the cash or credit to purchase them , corporations and other businesses are forced to stop producing them . Idle productive machinery means idle capital , which in turn means that people 's savings cease to work for them . Are stocks and bonds safe investments ? This is a difficult question , for there are many different industries , and many different companies in each industry issue a variety of stocks and bonds . Only a few general statements can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably safer than stocks , since bonds have the first lien on the assets of a corporation . Nevertheless it is safer to own stocks in some corporations than bonds in others .  | 2 . The return received from stocks and bonds varies . In well-managed companies in thriving industries , bonds deserve a high rating on rate and stability of income , as the amount of return is stated in the bond and the company must pay that amount . In depression periods , however , many bondholders do not receive any interest . The return on stocks varies with the prosperity of the industry and of the company . An industry 's having paid . dividends in the past is no sign that it will be able to do so in the future . 3 . Stocks and bonds listed on the stock exchanges are always salable. 4 . Diversification is possible by purchasing stocks and bonds of different companies in several industries . This probably requires more money than the average individual possesses .  | 5 . Many stocks increase in value ; many decrease in value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expected earning capacity of the corporation . 6 . The prices of stocks fluctuate very widely . Prices of bonds fluctuate less , but there is a good deal of variation in the price of bonds during periods of depression . 7 . Many bonds are available only in denominations of $1,000 and more . This is rather large for the small investor . The market value of many stocks is low enough so that small investors can purchase them , but frequently these are not the stocks that small investors ought to buy . 8 . The outright purchase of stocks and bonds offers no special inducement for saving regularly . When they are purchased on the installment plan a special incentive does exist . Investment bankers are really wholesalers and retailers of stocks and bonds . They serve the public interest by collecting the savings of many individuals and institutions for the use of industry and government . When a corporation or a governmental body is thinking of floating a new issue of securities the investment banker gives it counsel about the type of security to be issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyze the standing of the corporation . After the issue is decided on , the investment banker ( usually several investment bankers join to form a syndicate ) underwrites the issue . That means that the banker or the bankers assure the corporation that it will get the money at a certain time ; that is , they assume the risk of marketing the issue . The investment banker wholesales securities to other investment bankers and retails them to commercial and savings banks , life insurance companies , corporations with surplus cash on hand for investment , and other securitybuying institutions as well as to individual buyers . He turns over the money to the issuing corporation on the dates specified and charges them a commission .  | A stock exchange is a place where owners of stocks or bonds may sell them . Usually after an issue of stocks or bonds has been sold by an investment banker , it is traded on an exchange so that holders have a market for the securities . The true function of stock exchanges is to connect people who wish to sell securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both buyer and seller . Besides providing a market for the sale of securities , the buying and selling in the market gives a measure of the demand and the supply of a particular stock or bond . This tends to establish a price which , except in cases of excessive speculation , is a fairly accurate index of the security 's true worth . The largest of all stock exchanges in this country is the New York Stock Exchange . It is the primary market in the United States , and as such , is a vital part of our financial system . Memberships are secured by purchase from those who no longer wish to hold them ; the purchaser must be acceptable to the other members . Until 1929 , the Exchange had 1,100 members ; because of the increase in the volume of business 275 members were added in that year . The largest day 's business ever done on the Exchange was in October , 1929 . Over 16,000,000 shares of stock were sold on the day that ushered in the severest depression we have ever experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , since offices of member firms can be found in practically every city of any size in the United States . Thus the Exchange to all intents and purposes succeeds in bringing to its floor , face to face , all investors interested in buying or selling listed securities . Statements are required from all companies before their securities are listed on the Exchange , and these statements are open to the public . The New York Curb Exchange owes its name to the fact that originally curb brokers or their representatives assembled in the middle of the street for trading , regardless of weather conditions or traffic . The principles of sale or pur- chase on the Curb are to all intents and purposes the same as on the New York Stock Exchange . The chief function of the Curb Exchange is to make possible the sale of securities not listed on the New York Stock Exchange . The requirements for listing on the New York Stock Exchange are so stringent that many really strong companies are unable to meet them . These stocks need to be sold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second largest market in the United States . There are , however , other important exchanges , such as those of Roston , Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , Chicago , Detroit , San Francisco , and Los Angeles . Members of the New York Stock Exchange are divided into two general classes known as traders , who buy and sell on their own account , and brokers , who transact business for the public on a commission basis . The public is particularly interested in the brokers . A person who wishes to buy or sell a share of stock listed on , say , the New York Stock Exchange , telephones or visits any office of a firm having a membership in the Exchange . The order is recorded and transmitted over the broker 's private telegraph wire to the New York office , where the order clerk receives it , stamps the time , and transmits it at once to the Exchange floor over a private telephone . The broker who receives the order is the customer 's representative on the floor of the Exchange , and he closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made after he receives the order . He does this by simply saying , " Take it . " No written agreement or memorandum is exchanged between the offering broker and the taking broker . They are bound by the rules of the Exchange to carry out such transactions to the letter , and errors are rare . The broker on the Exchange has his telephone clerk report the transaction to the New York office ; from there the report is telegraphed back to the branch office through which the customer gave the order . In the meantime , if the buyer has been waiting in the branch office he has been able to read a record of the transaction on the tape as it issues from the ticker in his local broker 's office , although , of course , he could not identify the  | specific transaction , particularly if the stock is active . The broker charges a commission for every transaction , both when he buys and when he sells . Speculation on security exchanges has some marked peculiarities . Buying long is the action of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the price will go up . His primary intention in buying is not to hold the stocks for the dividends . Supposing he has decided that the stock of the XYZ Company , quoted today at $110 a share , will very soon go to $115 . He orders his broker to buy a hundred shares at $110 . If the price rises to $115 as he expects it to , he orders his broker to sell the shares . He has then made five dollars on each share , minus the brokerage expense . If  | he made a wrong guess and the price went down , he lost money . Selling short is just the opposite of buying long . In this case the speculator believes that prices will fall . Suppose he orders his broker to sell a hundred shares of the XYZ Company for $110 . Since he has no stock he must borrow the hundred shares , which he delivers to the buyer . If the price drops to $100 he buys the stock at that price in order to pay for the stock he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten dollars a share , minus brokerage expenses . However , if he made a mistake and the price goes higher , he must still deliver the securities he sold ; so he would be forced to . buy stock at a higher price than he sold it for , and he would lose money .  | Buying on margin means that the buyer is not paying cash for his securities but is depositing a certain amount with the broker to protect him against loss due to changes in price . If a broker asks a 25 per cent margin and the XYZ stock is selling at $100 a share , the buyer must put up $25 a share . If he has only $1,000 to invest , instead of buying ten shares he can buy forty . If the price of the stock goes up he can sell , pay the broker , and make the profit on forty shares instead of on ten . If the price falls , he must put up more and more margin . If he can not do that , the broker sells the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying securities is risky , as a sudden change may wipe out the margin . It is far safer to buy securities by paying cash . The Securities and Exchange Commission regulates many common market practices such as short selling and buying on a margin . To minimize individual loss government regulation is needed . The average individual 's wealth today is as likely to be in the form of stocks and bonds as it formerly was likely to be in the form of home , farm , or store buildings . Insurance companies , hospitals , educational institutions , research endowment funds , banks , and many other groups own securities . The financial status of millions of people thus depends on securities ' remaining stable in value . Without authentic information it is impossible to determine the safety and desirability of each stock or bond issue . Certain general rules can be followed in buying securities , but even such rules may prove unsafe unless extensive information available . Lack of adequate information before 1933 made government regulation absolutely necessary . To prevent social loss is another objective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into proper investment channels . If they are put into factories or machinery that do not produce things that people need  | and want , there will be just so much less capital to produce what people do need and want . If , for example , savings go into building and equipping tire factories that will produce three times the number of tires needed , those savings are largely wasted , for the factories will stand idle and the machinery will depreciate and become obsolete . Sometimes savings are even used to develop industries that are very harmful . At the same time there may be a great need for new homes , but not sufficient savings to build them . It is desirable for investors to have all possible information so that they may use their savings efficiently . State regulation consists mostly of laws known as blue-sky laws , for the detection and prosecution of frauds in the sale of stocks and bonds . State laws , of course , apply to the sale of securities within one particular state . The fraudulent security seller , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to another state . It has been expensive to bring  | such criminals back to the state where their crime was committed . State laws have proved inadequate also because no one state could enforce sufficiently stringent regulation unless other states did likewise . National regulation to correct the evils of uneven regulation by the states seemed necessary as President Roosevelt took office in 1933 . Legislation to regulate the issuance and sale of securities was passed during 1933 and 1934 . These laws aimed at giving the investing public all the facts that have a bearing on the value of securities offered in exchange for savings . In the words of President Roosevelt : This proposal adds to the ancient rule of caveat emptor , the further doctrine " Let the seller also beware . " It puts the burden of telling the whole truth on the seller . It should give impetus to honest dealing in securities and thereby bring back public confidence . The laws are not intended to tell people what risks they shall take with their money , but only to make it more nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular securities . The main general provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 : ( 1 ) create the Securities and Exchange Commission for the purpose of regulating security selling ; ( 2 ) provide for registration with the Securities Exchange Commission of all securities moving in interstate commerce ; ( 3 ) provide for the registration of all security exchanges and all persons doing business in securities ; ( 4 ) prescribe the information that must be made available to prospective purchasers of securities , including a statement of the stock holdings of directors and officers and of any material facts that may affect the value of the securities of any corporation ; ( 5 ) exempt the securities of Federal , state , and municipal governments , of common carriers , and those of banks from the operation of the act ; ( 6 ) empower the Securities and Exchange Commission to enact regulations for the conduct of security exchanges and brokerage busi- If you had your choice of a salary of $150 a month or a straight commission that might amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of any enterpriser receiving more profits from his business than would have been necessary to induce him to undertake it ? What risks did he assume when he started the enterprise ? What particular risks do businessmen in your community have to meet , which people doing business in other communities may not have ? ALL economic activity is attended with more or less risk . It was pointed out in Chapter 3 that many kinds of risks must be taken by the businessman . Because of new inventions , processes or even entire industries may become obsolete . Wars , strikes , fires , storms , financial  | panics and depressions , and even political changes may turn the expectation of profit into the certainty of losses . In our economic system goods are produced on a large scale in advance of actual needs . The needs may not develop . Others may have been producing the same or , similar goods for the same market , so that even if the needs do develop , each producer is often able to sell only a part of what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business under our present competitive system . The number of consumers who will buy low-priced cars depends on many factors , such as style , effectiveness of advertising , consumer incomes , and expectations of future  | prices . So it is with most other goods . All these factors may change for any number of unforeseeable reasons and thus upset the most careful calculations of producers . The risk of such changes must be taken by the businessman . Risk-taking is essential to production under current conditions , but it is annoying to most people . It is unpleasant to hazard present income and possessions for future uncertainties . To overcome the disinclination to take risks in our present industrial society , we allow people to make a profit if they succeed in their undertaking . Profits may be defined as the amount of money a business'man takes in over and above all expenses . Expenses should be reckoned as including not only money paid out but also what should normally go for rent on land and buildings , interest on investment , and wages for the enterpriser 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of putting money , time , and effort into a business . Amount of profits depends on efficiency of the businessman or entrepreneur in producing and selling . He must know how to buy raw materials , machinery , and labor to advantage and must be clever and capable in combining these three and in selling the finished product . In other words he must be a real bargainer . Profits arise from risk-bearing and good management . Let us assume that Mr. X is running a grocery business . He sells $40,000 worth of goods ; in other words he takes in $40,000 of cash . However , he has certain expenses :  | The difference between $40,000 and $32,000 is Mr. X 's gross profit . His net income is the difference between $40,000 and $35,900 ; that is , $4,100 . If Mr. X could have hired himself out to someone else at $3,000 and if he could have received $200 interest elsewhere on the capital he has invested in the business , his real profit for having assumed the risk and for having been a skillful manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $900 . As a rule profits tend to be short-lived in any industry , since the news of extraordinary profits will attract other entrepreneurs into the same field ; increased competition and increased output will cause the price to drop , and profits will become less and less . A new invention or improved technique generally brings huge profits , but these successes attract other capitalists who use similar improvements , so that in the end they cause profits to drop . Often profits are influenced by governmental regulation . The Federal government and many state governments take a share of profits by means of income taxes and excess-profits taxes . In the case of public utilities , the government regulates the rates that the public utility companies may charge for their services ( see page 477 ) ; this indirectly keeps down their profits . When the government operates any industry , such as an electric light and power system or a subway , and sells the service at a price which just covers the expenses of doing business , it prevents private capital from entering that . field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government is less efficient in the operation of a particular business than a private firm would be . Many people feel that the government must regulate or control business profits . When it is not curbed , the desire for big , quick profits results in unfair methods of competition , unfair trade practices , rackets , low wages and long hours , child labor , unemployment , the destruction and unsocial use of natural resources , the suppression of inventions that threaten to cut down immediate profits , bringing undue  | pressure to bear on legislators , perverting the tastes of millions through false and harmful advertising , and numerous other social ills . Government regulates industry in an attempt to eliminate these results of uncurbed competition . Some feel that the profit system should be not merely regulated but abolished . They would like the government to take most business risks . Functions now performed by businessmen would then be assigned to government employees . The government reduces risks in many ways . Organizations like the Federal Trade Commission , the Interstate Commerce Commission , the Securities Exchange Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fairness of trade practices and of competitive methods used by all persons , partnerships , and corporations in commerce  | among the states or with foreign nations . Such supervision reduces risks and gives all businesses a better chance . Bank laws are designed to diminish financial risks . Weather Bureau warnings to ships and farmers of oncoming storms and frosts help reduce risks of another kind . The research staffs of other governmental agencies give out valuable information to business concerns . The work of government toward eliminating unnecessary sizes and varieties of goods helps to reduce risks by reducing the amount of the stock that distributors must carry . These are only a few of the possible examples . Some risks can be prevented . Losses from fire are reduced by fireproof construction and by providing sprinkler systems and modern fire-fighting equipment . Machine guards prevent industrial accidents and so reduce losses to both worker and employer . Through advertising , business concerns try either to maintain a stable market or to secure an expanding one for their product as a means of avoiding risks of loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowledge often reduces economic risks . By carefully counting the number of people who pass a given site , a better location for a new store may be selected than if the site is chosen by sheer guess . Research staffs of colleges , universities , governments , and private firms study business cycles , seasonal changes , long-time trends , and present-day market conditions and attempt to show businessmen how to use this knowledge to minimize economic risks . Efficiency engineers try to organize production so as to eliminate all possible risks . Market analysis , a rather new profession based on economics , statistics , and psychology , seeks to minimize risks in the marketing of goods . Competition means rivalry and uncertainty . Sometimes competitive risks are lessened through mergers or trade asso- ciations or through agreements on fair competition ? for example , the Federal Trade Commission trade practice agreements . Marketing goods involves risks of physical deterioration , price fluctuations , and style changes . By taking the goods from manufacturers and holding them until retailers are ready to replenish their stocks , middlemen carry risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retailers . See Chapter 11 . A need for organized speculation arises from the fact that a flour manufacturer , for example , may be ruined by a rise in the price of wheat if he has contracted to sell flour at a specified price , while he may suffer likewise if the price of wheat , falls after he has bought it without having arranged for the sale of his flour at a specified price . The risk of price changes is universal in business . Professional speculators take this risk upon themselves . Speculation is buying and selling goods or securities with the hope of realizing a profit from price fluctuations . Commodity exchanges for grain , cotton , sugar , etc. , operate in our leading cities . In these exchanges the prices of commodities are made and rise and fall of supply and demand are registered minute by minute , hour by hour , day by day . From many standpoints the Chicago Board of Trade is the most interesting of commodity exchanges . The men who crowd its floor are buying and selling grain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) cash dealers , and ( 2 ) speculative traders . Cash dealers bargain for carloads of grain , with samples on tables in front of them . The grain bought and sold by them is paid for the same as in any other sales transaction . Much grain , however , is sold not on a cash basis for immediate delivery but for future delivery . Speculative traders make contracts for the delivery of certain speci- fled grades of grain sometime in the future . One trader buys , another sells , a contract calling for the delivery of a specified number of bushels of grain of a standard quality in a certain month . These contracts are called futures , and the future takes its name from the delivery month . If the contract calls for delivery in December it is referred to as December wheat , corn , oats , or other grain , as the case may be . On the stock exchanges , speculators buy the stocks and bonds of private corporations as well as the obligations of nations , states , and cities which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those which they believe will bring more than they are actually worth . Sometimes , as in 1928-29 , a large number of people in other occupations temporarily become speculators in stocks of all descriptions . They may be quite oblivious of the risks they are assuming . The eco- nomic function of speculators in stocks is to carry that part of the supply of securities which is not held for investment and thus to assume the risk of a fall in price . In this way it is always possible for investors and speculators to sell stocks or bonds quoted on the open market . Sometimes speculators , by buying securities when they are low and selling when high , make huge profits ; often they lose . In our economic society speculation is beneficial in several ways . Properly carried on , speculation helps to stabilize prices . In any speculative market , such as the wheat , cotton , or stock market , speculators account for a large part of the demand and supply of the commodity . By buying when prices are low , speculators stimulate demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they sell and thus add to the market supply of the commodity and help to lower its price . If there were not a speculative market , farm prices would probably tend to be very low in the fall when farmers are selling heavily and high in the spring when there are few sales . The speculative market tends to level prices for the entire year , so that unduly low prices are avoided in fall and very high prices months later . However , the speculator reduces price fluctuations only if he forecasts future demand and supply correctly . If he pushes up prices in the expectation of a small crop and a huge crop comes on the market , the percentage of price decline will be greater than it would have been without him . If he expected a large crop but actually it is small , the price rise will be greater than if he had not been active . The speculative market makes it possible for businessmen to eliminate the danger of losses from price changes by sacrificing also the possibilities of profit from such changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supply of wheat for a while may sell wheat in the speculative market for future delivery . If he loses on the flour made from the wheat because of a fall in price , he will make up the loss in the speculative market , and vice versa . This is hedging . I n the above illustration hedging can be successful only if t he  | prices of wheat and flour move up and down together . Speculators who sell goods to be delivered at some future date , without owning the goods at the time of the sale , sell short . When they contract to buy goods that are to be delivered at some future time , they are buying long . In both types of transaction they deal in futures . Our economic society requires continuous flow of goods and services . Speculation assures a continuous market for commodities and makes them liquid ; that is , the commodities can be converted into cash at a moment 's notice . Speculators are usually ready to buy what is produced . Certain evils also arise from speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy and sell like professional speculators . By incorrect guesses as to supply  | and demand , they may offset the good influence of the professionals . In any case , the losses of these ignorant lambs tend to give all speculation the appearance of a racket . Some professional speculators are also at fault , in trying to manipulate the market for their own advantage . They sell when supplies are large , in order to depress the market still further , and buy back at the extremely low prices that follow . In other cases , they try to gain control of the supply of a commodity and to sell it to their advantage . This is known as cornering and is frowned on by stock and commodity exchanges and by the government . Sometimes , too , speculators spread false rumors when they have stocks of goods that they wish to unload . In this way they induce outsiders to bid up the price until the stocks can be sold at a large profit . Exchanges are ordinarily unincorporated voluntary associations . As such they are subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The New York Cotton Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade are incorporated under special acts of the legislatures of New York and Illinois respectively and are subject to control by the legislatures . The general body of law of the state in which it is located applies to every exchange . The law regards commodity exchanges as fulfilling a useful purpose not in restraint of trade , although some of the members may act to that effect . The Federal government has attempted to eliminate the evils and assure to the public the benefits of commodity markets . Congress passed the Cotton Futures Act in 1915 and the Grain Futures Act in 1922 . Both were designed to regulate trading and speculation on exchanges . The latter act as amended in 1936 created the Commodity Exchange Commission . It has power to establish and enforce regulations governing speculation on the exchanges in the commodities covered by the Act . Congress passed these laws under the general constitutional grant of power to regulate interstate commerce . The United States Supreme Court has held them constitutional . Both acts emphasize publicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Securities Exchange Act of 1934 it is unlawful  | for any person to use any means of interstate commerce for the purpose of giving a false impression as to the activity of the market for any security . In the past , interested persons sometimes sold securities to each other and thus created a false market for the purpose of leading outsiders to believe n Mock was going up in price . This is now illegal . It is also illegal now to give out information to the effect that the price Ill any security is about to fall or rise because of market operations when the object is to buy or sell it to advantage .  | Do members of your family carry any kind of insurance ?

Sometimes , however , the financial loss is shared by a group of persons who had the foresight to plan for the unexpected casualty before it happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into two groups , . those that can not be calculated and those that are calculable ; that is , predictable . We find it possible to lighten the losses ; from predictable risks because we have a knowledge of the mathematical chances of a particular casualty 's occurring . We can plan accordingly and insure ourselves against losses . Insurance is a plan by which large groups of people , each in. danger of some large , uncertain loss , pay a much smaller sum into a common fund which is used to reimburse , partly or wholly , those among them who actually incur the loss . The whole group bears the loss that otherwise might be a crushing blow to the individual . It must be definitely understood that insurance does not , of itself , do away with loss from fire , hail , death , or some other calamity , but substitutes a small , certain cost to the individual for the risk of a large , . uncertain loss . The insurance company can assume the risk of a large loss because it distributes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , cost of insurance protection , are based on the law of averages . Careful studies have shown that among a large number of plate-glass windows so many will be broken ; among a large group of people of a given age a certain number will die each year ; among a large number of houses so many will be lost by fire each year . In actual practice anybody who insures his home against fire must contribute in proportion to the amount he would expect to recover if it burned plus something toward the operating expenses of the insurance company . Privately organized insurance companies are of two general types , stock and mutual . The stock company is like any other business corporation . Ownership and control of the company is vested in stockholders who either contributed money to start the company or bought stock after it was organized . The stockholders elect directors , who choose the officers . Profits go to the stockholders . The mutual company , on the other hand , has no stockholders , and profits are distributed to the policyholders , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly by those insured in mutual companies . In stock companies , the stockholders assume a share of losses if the rates charged to the insured do not bring in enough . Mutual companies usually charge rates high enough to build up a reserve against unexpectedly large losses . Some of them vary their charges according to losses actually suffered from time to time . If insurance companies charged only as much as the expected losses , they would make no profit . Rates are generally figured so that the companies can pay the losses even if they are larger than anticipated . When insurance companies make money , their profits arise from one or more of three sources : ( 1 ) a loss lower than expected ; ( 2 ) expenses  | lower than allowed for in figuring the rates ; ( 3 ) earnings on invested reserve funds in excess of calculations . The portion of insurance premiums ( money paid in periodically by those who are insured ) that is not immediately required for losses or expenses is invested . Money is lent to municipalities , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the money is lent to railroads , electric light , gas , and telephone companies . Loans are made to farmers to buy farms and to city residents to buy homes and apartment and office buildings . In other words , the pre- miums are put to work and collectively take an essential part , in the development of our country . Insurance companies perform a service to society through their educational programs . Life , health , and accident insurance companies carry on health and safety education along many lines . Fire insurance companies have been active in inducing communities to establish more efficient means of preventing fires and conquering them once they have broken out . Automobile insurance companies have done much to call public attention to the seriousness of the increasing automobile casualty rate . They have lobbied for stricter traffic laws and more rigid enforcement of such laws . Insurance can be taken out against loss of property from hail , frost , tornado , theft , fire , flood , or wind ; on cargoes at sea ; to protect senders against loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosions . Losses resulting from the dishonesty or carelessness of persons in charge of money or other valuable property , as well as exceptional losses from granting credit too freely , may be transferred from individuals to insurance companies . Insurance may be taken out against the raising or forging of checks . A rather novel form of insurance , from the standpoint of the general public , is rain insurance , frequently taken by promoters of outdoor entertainments to protect themselves against lowered gate receipts in case of bad weather . Life insurance may protect dependents against the death of the breadwinner , while health and accident insurance compensate for loss of time and expense incident to illness or disability . Automobile liability insurance protects the insured against paying damages for an accident . In short , insurance protection may be secured against any loss whose probability of occurrence can be calculated .  | Life insurance is an agreement on the part of an insurance company to pay an arbitrary fixed amount at the death of the insured , without reference to any actual damage to the survivors . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per thousand persons have been carefully noted by actuaries , who are employed by insurance companies for calculating risks and premiums . This information is gathered together in a form known as mortality tables , usually worked out for 100,000 lives beginning at the age of ten . In order to avoid increasing the rate as the person insured grows older , the great mass of life insurance today is written on the level premium plan . Payments remain equal . During earlier years of a life policy this premium is larger than necessary to cover the actual risk , and this takes care of the larger losses in later years . Such policies have an increasing cash value after the first two or three years . With the level premium plan or old line insurance , as it is usually called , the person insured can get his money back if he lives . He does not have to die to win . The excess premium , or the amount beyond that necessary to pay claims of old line policyholders during the earlier years , is invested by the insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Life insurance has rapidly increased in popularity during t he past twenty-five years . In 1929 the amount of insurance in force in the United States reached the hundred billion dollar mark . The present figure is well above that . To realize the importance of the billions of dollars paid by insurance companies to living policyholders and to the beneficiaries of deceased policyholders , it would be necessary to visit the homes of widows whose husbands have left them with some life insurance and those of other widows whose husbands were not so thoughtful or were financially or  | physically unable to purchase insurance . It would also be necessary to visit the homes of some of the thousands of old people living on the income of insurance policies bought in their earlier and more productive years and to contrast these homes with those of persons who have no insurance income . We all need insurance at some time . Our lives may be divided into three parts . Up to about twenty years of age our parents and the state co-operate in caring for us and preparing us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the second period ( about twenty to sixtyfive years of age ) we must work to care for ourselves and our children and to make provision for old age ; during these years , a life insurance policy may be of great aid in case of ( 1 ) death or ( 2 ) financial stress due to disability or other causes . Happiness in the declining years depends to some extent on how well we are able to build during the working period . As an investment , insurance guarantees savings for the day when productive work is not possible . The following diagram summarizes the needs that may be satisfied by a life policy .  | than this low point , a definite amount should be set aside to take care of future necessities . One future necessity is certainly insurance to wipe the slate clean of outstanding bills in case of death . For those whose economic status allows them to buy homes , a policy big enough to wipe out the mortgage becomes an insurance need ; it seems foolish to save for a home only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breadwinner . If wages or salaries are sufficient to provide for both present necessities and future necessities , and still have something left over , it is wise to provide in the budget for present comforts and then for future comforts . Part of the amount saved for future comforts should be used to provide for support of the wife and education of the children in  | case of the death of the breadwinner and also , by an endowment arrangement , to provide an income for the insured in case he lives . The final steps in the budget plan should provide , if the income is sufficient , for present luxuries and then for future luxuries . Part of the future luxury program might well be an income to maintain the , family 's standard of living in case of the insured 's death . To summarize , then , we may say that the amount of insurance to be carried depends on ( 1 ) the income of the insured ; ( 2 ) responsibilities as to dependent relatives ; ( 3 ) other financial obligations ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance is impossible for many people of low income or physically handicapped unless they are aided by the government through some form of social insurance . This will be discussed in the next chapter . To those who are physically and financially able , many kinds of policies or contracts offer protection against death , disability , old age , and emergencies . The commonest are as follows : 1 . Term insurance provides a means of buying pure protection . Such a contract usually has no cash or loan value at any time during its life or on maturity . The insured never collects on it , and the beneficiary can collect only if the insured dies during the term covered by the policy . Term policies may be for one , five , ten , or twenty years or more . After the end of the period no insurance remains in force . 2 . Ordinary life insurance , unlike term insurance , remains in force for the entire life of the insured if the premiums are regularly paid . A similarity to term insurance is that the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of policy has in addition an investment feature . The rate is higher than for the term policy and the difference builds up a cash or loan value to the insured , which is , however , substantially less than the amount paid in premiums . In a mutual company the dividends ( see page 378 ) , if they are left to accumulate with the company , will pay up the policy or make an endowment of it . 3 . The limited payment policy is similar in nearly all re- spects to ordinary life insurance except that premiums are paid for a limited number of years instead of for life . The face value of the policy is payable only at the death of the insured , even if that occurs after all premiums have been paid . The rates are higher than the ordinary life rates , which increases the investment feature . With a good mutual company , this type of policy will become an endowment at , the end of a certain number of years if dividends are left with the company . 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at the end of a number of years , specified in the contract , if the insured is living at that time . The premiums cease when the policy becomes due . The short-term endowment policy carries by far the highest investment element of the four types enumerated . It provides protection for dependents during its term and payment of the face amount of the policy to the insured or his beneficiary at maturity . 5 . An annuity is a policy that provides an annual , semiannual , quarterly , or monthly income to the person taking it out ( the annuitant ) . It is an investment policy making sure that an individual will enjoy an income from a given date until death . 6 . Industrial or weekly premium insurance is intended primarily for workers in industrial occupations who receive weekly wages . The premiums are payable weekly in unit amounts of one or five cents and multiples thereof , and the amount of insurance provided by a unit weekly premium is determined by the age of the insured at the issuance of the policy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average policy around $200 . Children are accepted as risks . Industrial insurance , although largely carried by wage earners , does not cover all their insurance needs . Weekly collections , small policies , the exceedingly high proportion of policies that are allowed to lapse or are surrendered for their cash value , have added to overhead costs . The total fifty-two weeks ' payments on $1,000 of insurance is  | I lms higher than the yearly rate of the regular type of insurance . The wage earner can least afford high costs . On t he whole , industrial insurance is looked on by the policyholder as burial insurance , but even here it does not seem ; adequate . The expenses incidental to the death of the average industrial policyholder are probably more than $200 . During periods of unemployment workers often have to let heir policies lapse , and this leaves them unprotected . 7 . Fraternal insurance is insurance protection for members of certain fraternal orders . Formerly most fraternal insurance was written on the assessment plan ; that is , losses were met as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . Recently many of these orders have keen writing insurance more and more approximating that of the old line companies . 8 . Group insurance is written for the employees of a company . They are insured simultaneously under one policy for an amount determined by a definite plan or formula which applies to all , or to all in a given classification , without discrimination as to individuals . They are insured irrespective of age , sex , race , or physical condition . The premium is paid by the employer or by the employer and employee jointly . One great advantage of group insurance , from the viewpoint of the older workers , is that no medical examination is required . Those unable to obtain other life insurance can get group insurance . It thus builds up the morale and efficiency of workers by eliminating worry . Group insurance covers workers only so long as they stay with the company . When a worker goes on strike he forfeits his policy . If he is discharged he also loses it . He may continue it as an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most people out of work can not assume the added obligation . Critics of group insurance also say it leaves out the overwhelming mass of wage earners . Only a small percentage of wage earners are covered by group policies . The unemployed or unemployable are never included . In selecting an insurance policy everyone should think over his particular needs and see how much of the amount  | 1 . Safety of principal . Very few life insurance companies have failed . In the few that have , death claims have been met in nearly every case . The cash value of policies has suffered in a few instances . Cash value of an insurance policy does not in any case equal the amount paid in until it has been in force a number of years . 2 . Rate of return . Most companies are required by law to earn 3 per cent on their reserves . The rate is low , but stability is high . 3 . Marketability . The cash or loan value of the policy is generally paid on demand , although many companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to postpone these payments for six months after notice has been given . 4 . Diversification . Each policy is backed by all the resources of the company . These resources are varied , making the investment free from local hazards such as bank failures , droughts , and real estate slumps . 5 . Possible increase in value . Each year the cash and loan value and the paid-up value increase . In case of premature death the amount received is far greater than the amount paid in. 6 . Stability . The contract specifies the exact cash value , the loan value , and the paid-up insurance value . The only fluctuating factor is the dividend return of mutual insurance companies . 7 . Satisfactory denominations . An individual may take out as little or as much as he feels his needs require and his pocketbook will allow ; that is , if he is an insurable risk . 8 . Incentive to save . Premium notices serve as reminders that it is time to make deposits . When purchases have been based on individual needs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments may , however , prove burdensome if the policyholder has been oversold . This is especially true in times of economic stress . It may even cause the policyholder to become disgusted with his  | whole insurance program and to drop more of it than is necessary . For this reason , it is very important to buy insurance to meet individual needs and in quantities to suit individual means . Some people can not afford to buy any insurance . Accident and health insurance provide for the payment of a weekly income to the insured in the event of physical incapacity caused by accident or illness and for a death benefit in case of death by accident . Some policies also provide for hospital and nurses ' fees and costs of surgery and medical treatment . This type of insurance is purely protective , and no payment is made unless the calamity occurs . Definite payments are usually provided in an accident policy for accidental loss of legs , arms , fingers , or eyes . Accident and health policies are offered by casualty insurance companies , by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Health or accident policies may be taken out separately , or a contract may include indemnification for either calamity . Eligibility for this type of insurance has its fixed limitations . People under eighteen years of age or over fifty-five or sixty and those engaged in hazardous occupations are generally not insurable . It is necessary to be in good health in order to qualify for health insurance . Women find it difficult to obtain health insurance unless they occupy steady , nonhazardous positions , and even then not all disabilities are covered . The rates or premiums depend on age , occupation , amount of weekly and total indemnity provided , and the varieties of accidents or illnesses covered by the policy . Almost invariably these policies are cancelable during the policy year , or the company may refuse to renew them at the end of the policy year . The group policy is a relatively new form of health insurance which generally covers both sickness and accident s . Employees of a company are insured simultaneously under one policy irrespective of age , sex , race , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the rate  | charged the group . This type of health and accident insurance seems to be becoming more and more popular . Property insurance includes numerous classifications . The six most important will be considered here . In all cases , the insurance is based on the law of averages . The insurance is taken out purely for protection in case of loss , and there is no investment or thrift consideration involved . Fire insurance includes the loss caused directly by fire , as well as loss and damage caused in the course of combating it or by the accidental discharge or leakage of protective equip- ment like automatic sprinklers . The rate or premium charged depends on many factors , such as location , construction , safety devices on the property to be insured , and fire protection available in the community . Fire insurance contracts are issued in a standard form of policy which is made mandatory by the state in which the insured property is located . The New York standard policy is generally used . It states the conditions under which the policy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties to the contract , the maximum of liability , the exact time of expiration , and the premium . It enumerates restrictions on the insured and provides that if certain necessary facts and conditions are withheld or misrepresented the policy becomes void . Fire insurance policies frequently provide for indemnification in case of loss by tornado , hail , flood , rain , or earthquake . Marine insurance generally covers the goods from shippers ' warehouses to consignees ' warehouses , through all the various stages of transportation until the delivery is made . Complete automobile coverage must include five types of protection . ( 1 ) Personal liability insurance protects the owner of a car from financial loss arising out of legal liability incurred by inflicting bodily injury on others in an automobile accident . ( 2 ) Property damage insurance protects the owner of an automobile against payment of damages for injury or destruction of the property of others . ( 3 ) Collision insurance covers damage to a car because of collision with a moving or a stationary object . ( 4 ) Fire insurance provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually not including the contents of the car . ( 5 ) Theft insurance , as the name implies , protects the owner in case his car is stolen , but does not cover contents of the car . Special policies may be taken out to protect the contents of a car from loss by theft or fire .  | Automobile insurance is extremely important because a social problem arises from the increasing number of accidents . It is frequently suggested that all drivers of automobiles should be required to take out liability insurance . Owners of buildings frequented by the public find it desirable to carry insurance against claims that may arise out of accidents occurring in the building or on the sidewalk . Owners of stores and office buildings carry such insurance , and policies are written for many private homes . Theft insurance provides indemnification for loss of goods by stealing . It covers losses due to tradesmen , mechanics ,  | servants working on the premises , and sneak thieves gaining entrance without the use of force . Burglary insurance covers theft when entrance is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from dishonesty on the part of employees or other persons who are in a position to cause a loss of money by their acts . There are numerous other types of property insurance , but those mentioned will suffice to show that it is possible to protect property against a wide range of risks . The insurance business and the government are brought together in many ways . The Supreme Court declared in 1868 that insurance is not commerce within the meaning of the Constitution and therefore not subject to Federal regulation . Therefore regulation over the insurance business rests with the state governments . It is designed for the protection of ( 1 ) the policyholders against sharp practice by insurance companies ; and ( 2 ) the companies from excessive competition among themselves . The law of insurance contracts defines the rights of insured and insurer . The states have commissioners or departments of insurance whose duty it is to see that every company doing business within the state complies with the laws of the state and is able to fulfill its contracts and that all insurance funds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they originate and must be licensed to do business in any other state . Other insurance laws are designed to secure the financial safety of insurance companies , to protect them against fraudulent suits by the insured , and to protect the insured in all legitimate claims . The power to tax insurance companies gives the states n great deal of power over their business . Many other activities of governments affect the insurance business . Local  | and state governments usually carry insurance on their properties in privately organized companies in order to protect themselves against loss . Sometimes provision is made for some of the risks to be carried by special state funds , which are thus really competitors of the insurance companies . Building inspection , although its purpose is to protect the community against losses from fire , also protects the insurance companies by cutting down their costs . City water supplies indirectly help to reduce insurance costs . Such programs as public health promotion , safety legislation and administration , publication of vital statistics , and detection and prosecution of insurance frauds have all aided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | municipal courts have helped to reduce risks connected with theft and burglary insurance . In the matter of automobile thefts , police aid in recovering stolen property helps to reduce the amounts that the insurance companies have to pay . The insurance business has also felt the effects of national legislation . The life insurance companies are heavy investors in railroad securities . Any law affecting railroads affects their investments . They are also heavy investors in government bonds so that anything that affects the public credit affects them too . To a lesser degree the same is true of other sorts of insurance companies . Sometimes privately owned companies compete with government-operated war risk life insurance , marine insurance , and parcel post insurance . When the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was organized to soften the effects of the depression on business , life , fire , and casualty insurance companies were included in the classifications of business entitled to financial assistance . While some companies borrowed from the corporation , the majority did not . Virtually the entire amounts borrowed were repaid within a short time . All in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other businesses .  | Does your family attempt to budget for medical care ? Do the members of your family visit the doctor periodically for health checkups even though they appear perfectly well ? If so , why ? If not , why not ? Do the hospitals in your community give free care to the dependent sick ? If so , do the doctors in these hospitals donate their services ? How does your community care for dependent old people ? How does your community aid the unemployed ? Do you approve of the methods ? PEOPLE in most industrialized countries regard protection against possible loss of earning power because of . sickness , accident , old age , unemployment , or death is very important . In these countries protection ordinarily tikes the form of a state-instituted plan of compulsory in- surance designed to reduce such financial injury and the suffering that results . Legislation of this sort is called social insurance . Social insurance differs from private insurance in three ways : 1 . Policyholders become such by virtue of a law that places them under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntary decision to become insured . Large groups of workers are automatically insured by legislation against accidents , sickness , death , unemployment , and dependency in old age . 2 . The premium payments are usually made by the employer . Sometimes they are deducted from the wages of the employee . Sometimes the employer pays a part of the cost , in a few instances all of it . In any case he is responsible for making the payments . The public treasury may contribute a part of the cost . Contributions toward the premiums must come from some other source besides the public treasury for a system to earn the name of insurance ; if government bears the entire cost it is a pension or a dole . 3 . Government has an important part in the administration of the system . There are about 2,500,000 accidents in American industry each year . About 25,000 persons lose their lives while at work . Under the common law the employer was not held responsible for injuries to his workers if he had provided a reasonably safe place to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job . If it could be proved that the employee had been negligent , the employer was not held liable . For example , if a worker lost a finger or a hand partly because of.his own negligence , he could not recover anything from the employer . If he lost it because of the carelessness of a fellow worker , he could recover from him , though not from the employer ; but fellow workers ordinarily p 391 had no means with which to pay damages . Under these tiles it was very difficult for the injured man or his family to collect from the employer . When he ( lid collect anything it as usually only after a long-drawn-out and costly lawsuit . During the past thirty years forty-six of our states and Congress have passed laws placing the responsibility of industrial accidents on the shoulders of the employer and requiring him to insure his liability . By these laws , known as workmen 's compensation laws , a weekly income is guaranteed t he workers in case they lose time because of an accident . I n case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition , medical expenses are paid . Usually the insurance is compulsory for almost all classes of workers . The premiums are paid by the employer . Society believes that accidents are properly part of the costs of industry and should be borne by it . In addition to providing compensation for workers in case //  | of accident , state laws contain many provisions designed to reduce the number of accidents . Such laws require the installation of safety appliances and fire escapes . Gears , belting , and shafts must ordinarily be covered . Boilers are inspected . Railway trains must have automatic couplers and air brakes . These are only a few examples of common requirements in the state and Federal laws . Possibly seven million people are ill in the United States every day . The health problem that society has to face is threefold : prevention of disease , medical care during illness , and compensation for loss of wages . The government , both state and national , has done much to prevent disease , but had left medical care and wage compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual or his employer . One of the more important causes of the need for charitable  | relief today is ill health . A long sickness can easily wipe out the savings of a lifetime . The amount of sickness that will occur in any one year in any family is unpredictable . II is for this reason that budgeting for medical care on an individual family basis is hardly practicable . Health insurance is not included in our present social insurance program . In the United States thousands of men and women face old age with empty pockets . In 1935 there were probably approximately 2,400,000 people aged sixty-five and over who were dependent either on public charity or on relatives , friends , and private charity . The problem of the aged is more serious today than ever before . A larger proportion of our population is over sixty-five . In 1870 men and women over sixty-five constituted only 3 per cent of the American population , while in 1940 they made up almost 7 per cent , with a total of 9,019,000 . At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are growing smaller , support from children is diminishing , modern industry has little use for men and women in the upper age groups , and the city apartment with no fireside for a grandin ther 's corner has become common . In 1900 , less than 32 per cent of men of sixty-five and over were unemployed ; in 1940 the percentage had increased to more than 61 per cent .  | There are several possible sources of support for the aged . 1 . Past savings . Millions of families , however , have incomes barely sufficient to meet their daily needs , and have no surplus that they can save for old age . 2 . Relatives and friends . So many workers are unable to provide even for themselves that it is impossible to leave the aged to their care . 3 . Public charity . Charity , in the case of old people , generally means the poorhouse , which is socially expensive and personally distasteful . 4 . Private pensions . Individual employers have set up pension plans . The weaknesses of individual employer pension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not included . Only a small minority of employers have instituted such plans . Usually only those employees who have worked for the company a required number of years are eligible for pensions . b . The average amounts of yearly pensions under existing  | plans are usually inadequate . There is no legal responsibility on the employer to pay pensions . He may change I lie plan at his discretion . c . They result in fewer old workers ' being hired . Sometimes workers are discharged a short time before reaching the pension age . 5 . State or national pension plans . Under a system of old age pensions , all men and women over a specified age ( say sixty-five or seventy ) become eligible for a pension if  | they do not have sufficient earnings or accumulated wealth to support themselves . An old age pension system is not , social insurance . It is based on need , not previous contributions , and is paid for through taxes . 6 . A comprehensive state or Federal social insurance program . Under such a program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public treasury . Old age annuities , to which contributions have been made year by year during the working years of life , will be at least . partially paid for by the recipients . No stigma will be attached to such a reward , for it will not be based on need , as is the case with old age pensions . During no year since 1910 has the army of the unemployed shrunk to less than a million . Unemployment , with attendant economic insecurity , was prevalent even during the socalled prosperous ' 20 's . During the depression the number was as high as 15,000,000 and during 1935 ? 40 fluctuated between 7,000,000 and 10,000,000 . Many suggestions have been made to alleviate the distress resulting from unemployment . Aside from direct relief , there are two important plans , ( 1 ) public works , and ( 2 ) unemployment compensation . Unemployment can be relieved through an enlarged program of public works . Such a plan includes not only public construction of all kinds , but useful employment for professional and other unemployed groups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are idle through no fault of their own . Cash payments to unemployed workers are made from a special fund or reserve built up by contributions collected from employers and based on wages paid to employed workers included in the plan . When people die the relatives require at least enough money to bury them . Breadwinners need to leave something for the support of their families . Perhaps the day ma  | come when social insurance laws will be so arranged that each adult will leave at least the amount necessary to bury him and to fulfill the family obligations he has assumed . In the United States the social insurance movement has lagged far behind European plans . Probably we have been more indifferent because up to the past few years our wage workers have been better off . Since the depression of the early 1930 's we have taken more interest in social insurance plans . Workers in industry who are injured are taken care of , as V e have seen , by workmen 's compensation laws . Despite the many requirements of the laws , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively safe and to compensate adequately those who suffer because of accidents . The following are among the weaknesses of the present laws : 1 . There is great lack of uniformity among state laws . 2 . Few state laws require proper safeguards against certain risks , as for example , the danger of dust explosions in coal mines . 3 . Occupational diseases , although just as serious as accidents , are fully covered in only a small minority of states . 4 . Safety requirements are insufficient in many states . Inadequate fire protection , unguarded machinery , and ineffectual protection for workers handling poisonous materials are still the rule in too many plants . 5 . Even those states that have adequate laws often have inefficient and costly enforcement machinery . 6 . Benefits are frequently inadequate to maintain the worker 's family even at the lowest standard of living . We may expect much discussion of these problems during the next decade or two . We must expect to find government playing a larger role in regulating safety conditions , in the compensation of injured workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vocational rehabilitation of  | injured workers . Probably our workmen 's compensation laws should not be regarded as a form of social insurance , but it is the nearest thing that we had to social insurance , except an unemployment insurance law in Wisconsin , until the Federal Social Security Act of 1935 . The Social Security Act became law on August 14 , 1935 . Its most important provisions are for ( 1 ) Federal old age benefits ; ( 2 ) grants to states for old age assistance ; and ( 3 ) grants to states for unemployment compensation administration . The Social Security Board , consisting of three members appointed by the President , administers the law . The act sets up two systems for aiding the aged . Old age assistance consists of pensions granted by a state to its needy aged under specific conditions provided by the law of the state and approved by the Social Security Board . These pensions are based exclusively on the needs of the individual applicants . The Federal government matches every dollar spent by the state for old age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month for a single individual . Not all pensioners receive $40 a month , however , since some of the states contribute less than $20 a month , and the amount actually granted to any individual is based on his need . The Federal government , in addition , pays an amount equal to 5 per cent of the sum granted to the states for administrative expenses . Under the rules of the Social Securit y Board , state plans must include certain eligibility requirements such as age , residence , and citizenship and must conform to certain standards of administration . All the states have enacted plans for old age benefits that meet the approval of the Social Security Board . Payments to the aged  | under state laws and under this portion of the act should not he confused with old age annuities . Old age benefits or annuities are paid to people over sixtyfive years of age from an old age trust fund especially set aside for this purpose by the Federal government . Workers are entitled to these payments irrespective of whether they are in need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of their wages to the fund from which the annuities are paid . The payments described above as old age assistance will no doubt tend to decline as more and more aged workers become eligible for annuity payments . The monthly old age benefit payments depend on the average monthly earnings of the beneficiary during the period between December 31 , 1936 , and the date of his or her retirement at the age of sixty-five . They will vary from $10 to $S5 a month . A sample of actual monthly payments to people in different wage groups is : The plan is financed by special taxes levied on all workers and employers affected by the act from January 1 , 1937 . Each worker has a certain percentage deducted from his wages , starting with 1 per cent from 1937 to 1942 inclusive and increasing to 3 per cent by January 1 , 1949 . The employer adds an amount equal to what he had deducted from the wages of each employee and transmits the combined  | sums to the Federal government . Taxes are paid on only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than that in any one year . If a worker fully covered by the old age benefit system dies before attaining the age of sixty-five , leaving a widow and dependent children , the wife receives a monthly benefit equal to 75 per cent of the husband 's earned benefit until till youngest child is eighteen . The children receive further amounts until they are eighteen . If there are no dependent children , the widow or the estate receives a lump sum settlement . If he dies after sixty-five , his widow receives a  | monthly payment when she reaches sixty-five equal to 75 per cent of the husband 's monthly benefit check . Advantages of the Federal plan may be summarized thus : 1 . Savings are compulsory . 2 . Both the employer and the individual worker contribute . 3 . Premiums are paid automatically ; that is , they are deducted before the worker receives his check . 4 . Benefits depend on the individual 's earnings . Disadvantages of the Federal plan are : 1 . Many wage earners ' incomes are so low that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 . Congress decides the age at which the income will start . The individual has no choice . 3 . The savings can not be used in case of an emergency .  | 4 . No contract exists . The provisions were changed in 1939 and are open to further change by Congress . Unemployment compensation by Federal means was not provided for by the Social Security Act , which did , however , offer inducements to the states to establish such systems . A Federal tax of 3 per cent of their wage bill is levied on all employers of eight or more persons . This is in addition to the payroll taxes levied because of old age annuities . If an employer contributes to a state unemployment compensation fund he may deduct such payments from his Federal tax , up to 90 per cent of it . The law also provides for a total annual grant of $80,000,000 to states passing such legislation , to be used for the administration of their systems . Originally an important argument against unemployment compensation laws was that any state that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive disadvantage with industries in states without such a law . Because of the Federal tax , industries in states with unemployment compensation systems are no longer at a competitive disadvantage as compared with similar industries in other states . The sums collected by the states by the above-mentioned payroll tax are distributed in benefits to the unemployed . If a state has no unemployment compensation law all money collected through the Federal tax on employers is paid to the Treasury . This provision has made it desirable for the states to have an unemployment compensation law . All our states now have such a law and are paying benefits . Wisconsin , which passed its unemployment compensation law in 1932 , was the first to begin paying benefits , in 1936 . Workers in our industrial society are harassed by many risks . They are subject to accidents , poor health , dependent old age , unemployment , death . Out of their meager earnings they can not hedge against all of these hazards . They need help from all of us . What effects might a complete social insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wages of ordinary unskilled workers in your community ? How do their wages compare with those paid the skilled workers ? clerical workers ? clerks in stores ? Are wages in your community higher or lower than they were five or ten years ago ? Will the wages paid now purchase more or less of the things that workers must buy than the wages paid five or ten years ago ? Is there unemployment in your community ? If so , what causes it ? Are any of the people you know dissatisfied with their jobs ? If so , why ? Can you think of any way of remedying such dissatisfaction ? Has the national defense program affected the wages , hours , and living conditions of workers in your community ? Have women taken any jobs formerly held by men ? Have workers from other places come to your community or have workers of your community gone elsewhere ?  | MODERN plants and machinery are so expensive that individual workers could not possibly own them . In consequence , workers have become dependent on people with capital who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials and own and market the finished products . The modern worker has lost control over the conditions under which he works , the hours that he works , the kind of goods he makes , and the way he makes them . Out of this situation arises the labor problem . In the labor bargain , as in all bargains , there are at least four parties , the buyer , the seller , the alternative buyer , and the alternative seller . The buyer is the employer who offers a job ; that is , he offers to buy the services of the worker , who in this case is the seller . The wages are the price paid for the services of labor . The alternative buyer is the employer to whom the worker may go if he does not take a particular job , while the alternative seller is the other worker whom the employer may hire . The alternative buyer and the alternative seller have a special social significance in the labor bargain , because it is probably more often true in a bargain over wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative opportunity ; that is , he must take the job offered him or go without . Going without a job means that the rent can not be paid , nor can food and clothing be bought . Wages are the heart of the labor bargain . They are the price paid for human services , either mental or physical . Most employers , because of competition , pay wages just high enough to maintain the efficiency of their business . Laborers are anxious to get as high wages as possible . What the rate of wages will be depends not only on the workers '  | efficiency , that is , their strength , speed , steadiness , and alertness , but also on the number of people who are prepared and eager to take their jobs if they should quit and on the attitude of the employers who would be ready to hire workers if they were without a job . If there is an abundant supply of workers for certain jobs , wages will generally be low . When t Ile supply is scarce , wages are high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply and demand . ' The demand and supply of workers for particular jobs is affected by many factors . The risk incident to the job , the social esteem in which it is held , the extent of unionization , whether the job can be done by either men or women , all affect the supply of workers . The demand comes from employers . When there is a demand for the employers prod- ucts , they are ready to hire workers . Out of the competition of employers for workers and the competition of workers for jobs , a wage rate emerges . The workers compete not only among themselves but also in many cases with machines which the employer may use instead of hiring more men . Sometimes wages are regulated by the state . When that , is so , laws are designed to make certain that both employers and employees get a square deal . The government thus acts as an economic referee . ( See page 112 . ) Wages may be expressed as ( 1 ) money wages , or ( 2 ) real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money received by workers in exchange for their services . These are their money wages . In discussing wage changes , it is important to remember that the price of the things that workers buy with the wages they receive may change . Real wages may be defined as the actual commodities and services that the money wages will buy . The wage earners standard of living is determined not so much by the money wage received as by real wages or the amount of goods and services that it will buy . Money wages may go up and real wages down at the same time . This was especially true during 1914-20 , when money wages were going up , but the prices of  | the things that workers bought were going up more rapidly , so that the workers found themselves worse off with the increased wages than they had been before either wages or prices started upward . Wages are usually paid either as ( 1 ) time wages , or ( 2 ) piece wages . Time wages are the amounts paid for labor by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the year . Piecework wages are the amounts paid for finishing specific tasks ; for example , putting the caps on so many dozen jars of cold cream , making a certain number of buttonholes in men 's suits , or stitching a certain number of shoe uppers . The task and bonus system is a modification of ordinary piecework . Under this system , the worker is expected to turn out a minimum amount of work for which he usually receives a definite wage . If he produces more than the amount set as his task , he receives a bonus . If he frequently falls short of the task , he is transferred to another job or discharged . Variations of the task and bonus system are numerous , but all aim at getting the worker to exert himself in order to produce more goods . Sometimes the laborer secures extra wages in the form of ( 1 ) a share of the profits ( if any ) of the business ; ( 2 ) a right to purchase shares of stock of the corporation below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension if he stays with the company until old age ; or ( 4 ) insurance at reduced cost . In some cases these extras have been used as a sop to keep workers satisfied with low wages . The amount of wages should be adequate to provide the food , clothing , shelter , and medical attention necessary to maintain physical efficiency . Most people in our country like to have some added comforts and luxuries , besides saving a few dollars every month . If income is not sufficient to enable people to save when they have jobs , they will be forced to rely on charity in times of unemployment or sickness . The minimum budget for a family of five , to provide a medium number of comforts in addition to the necessaries , was found to be $2,380 by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1925 . On the other hand , the study of the  | mate , the annual income of the median American family was $1,160 in 1935 , or approximately $22 a week . These figures seem to indicate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his present needs and therefore does not enable him to save . As a result , workers are dissatisfied . The six-day week with long hours each day was developed under rural conditions , when the pace was slow and work varied from day to day . Machine work today requires intense concentration . Specialization in industry means the tiresome repetition of a few simple motions , thus stunting the physical and mental development of the worker and subjecting him to excessive nervous tension . Shorter hours and longer periods of rest are necessary to counteract these destructive tendencies . Generally speaking , weekly hours of work have been going down gradually during the past century . During the depression of the early 1930 's a backward step was taken . Employees everywhere feared unemployment , and many times employers took advantage of this fear and demanded longer hours from their workers . Other employers demanded long hours because they afforded the only means of competing with less scrupulous competitors . In order to protect the more socially minded employers and at the same time to help solve the problem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum wages has been enacted . The matter has also received considerable attention from state legislatures . These laws will be discussed in Chapter 26 . The income of wage earners is not only frequently inadequate in amount , it is also uncertain because of the possibility of death , accident , illness , or loss of work . A man 's work has a most potent effect on his health and his span of life . Professional and white collar workers can expect to live p 416 about five years longer than actors , actresses , and drivers of armored cars ; eight years longer than dance hall keepers , ice and coal truck drivers , building roofers , or bottlers of beer ; ten years longer than trapeze performers , laborers in cotton gins , electricians in mines , and structural iron workers ; twelve years longer than bartenders ; and twenty-five years longer than nitroglycerin workers in a cartridge factory and jockeys on the race track . The death rate among unskilled workers is almost twice as high as that among other occupational groups . An analysis of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the number of deaths for every 1,000 male workers varied from 7 in the professional group to 13 for unskilled workers . As was pointed out in Chapter 23 , an accident may cause a worker to lose wages for a period of days , weeks , months ,  | or years . This results in loss of purchasing power . Illnesses also cut into the income of workers . Such unexpected losses of wages dislocate plans for spending income . If , for example , the worker who is buying a home becomes ill , he may not be able to meet the payments , and the chances are that the savings already invested in the home will be sacrificed . While the average amount of time lost because of illness is only eight or nine days a year , the entire income of many families is cut off for weeks and sometimes for months . Families which have experienced long illnesses are in greatest need of some arrangement to provide an income when the pay check is stopped by sickness . Records show that the amount of sickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unemployed it is 38 per cent higher than among families with annual incomes of $425 or more per person .  | Exposure to excessive heat , to sudden variations in temperature , and to dust causes many deaths and much sickness , and so do various forms of industrial poisoning . The greater prevalence of disease among unskilled workers as compared with other groups is illustrated by the fact that tuberculosis of the lungs caused 13 out of every 100 deaths among unskilled workers , compared with 5 out of every 100 deaths among professional and business men . No wonder that workers demand more healthful working conditions whenever they have a chance . If a workshop is clean , free from excessive smoke , gas , dust , lint , variations in humidity and temperature , and other things that might injure the worker 's health , he is saved the cost of much sickness . Further , the employer may furnish a nurse , or doctor in case of illness . Everybody wants a permanent job . Temporary work does not provide the security that is vital to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenure are : ( 1 ) the unrestricted power of the employer to discharge ; ( 2 ) inability or unwillingness of the employee to perform the tasks required of him ; ( 3 ) wide fluctuations in the demand for labor . The unrestricted power of the employer to discharge means that the worker is at the complete mercy of the employer as far as his job is concerned . The employer feels this is a desirable situation , because he must pay the employee his wages , and if the latter 's services are not satisfactory the employer wants to be in a position to get rid of him . Inability or unwillingness to work makes jobs insecure . Some people are out of work because they prefer idleness . Others are just restless ; the desire for a better place keeps them on the move . Many are mentally and physically unable to work . Among the idle are also the misfits of society ,  | inadequately prepared for the jobs that are open to them . The misfits are generally laid off first . They can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer jobs are suited to the abilities of old people . In consequence , men are often laid on the shelf because of age . Frequently they have difficulty in finding jobs when they are past forty-five years of age . Old age pensions and annuities will partially eliminate the desire of people to keep their jobs long past the  | time when they can fill them efficiently , but a prospective old age income will not help the man between forty-five and sixty-five who feels himself insecure because he is no longer as nimble and alert as he once was . There are many economic reasons for the wide fluctuations in the demand for labor and in the insecurity that workers feel because of the constant threat of unemployment . ( See page 396 . ) Some businesses provide many more jobs at one time of year than at others . For example , employment in cement factories or in ice cream plants is greater in summer than in winter . Most construction work is done during the summer months . Seasonal unemployment is expected and is at least to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wages and profits earned during the busy portion of the year are used to carry men over the period of enforced idleness . When machines or other new methods are substituted for men the resulting unemployment is known as technological . It was pointed out in Chapters 2 and 3 that new machines , at least temporarily , make it possible to dispense with a number of workers , and these men and women must shift for themselves until they find new places . Geographical unemployment is a sufficiently self-explanatory name for the situation of men losing their jobs and remaining idle in one locality while employers in other regions are seeking workers . Neither group may know of the existence of the other . Such unemployment results from the lack of a properly organized labor market . While such a market would not guarantee security of tenure , it would offer another job if there were one available anywhere . Sometimes shifts in the location of industry cause unemployment of this type . Changes in the location of milling and packing industries are illustrations of geographical shifts . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake . During periods of business depression many are thrown out of work . This is called cyclical unemployment . It re- suits in a great deal of suffering , for there are few new jobs available during a depression . Unemployment through mergers may result from business combinations . Generally speaking , the older and the least efficient men and women who have been employed in the merged units are weeded out first . Unemployment because of style changes follows alteration in consumers ' buying habits . Laborers who were making the commodities that pass out of favor lose their jobs . Although new industries may create work for others , the workers in the displaced industries find it difficult to secure new jobs . ( See pages 25-30 . ) Insecurity of tenure is thus very widespread . It is one of the reasons why workers are anxious to have some voice in determining who is to be laid off , even if they recognize that they can not decide how long men and women are to remain in enforced idleness . Unemployment develops fears and prejudices . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker often undersells his services to the employer . He is also anxious to limit the supply of labor , and it is for this reason that he has favored the enactment of immigration laws eliminating competition of laborers from foreign lands . It is his insecurity , his fear of unemployment , that has frequently caused the employee to oppose the introduction of automatic and semi-automatic machines . From the same fear of unemployment he has fought against the increased employment of women , especially married women , and has developed the idea that no one should work unless he absolutely needs a job . The worker often fails to see that a healthy society is one in which all are producing and therefore consuming . Society needs the economic activity of all . Even if jobs were parceled out on the basis of need , who should determine what constitutes need ? Workers sometimes overlook the fact that what is a luxury to one is a necessity to another . Again , it is due to fear of unemployment and bitterness against low wages that manual laborers sometimes protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the physical things that labor produces , not the importance of ideas . Warped viewpoints an , naturally assumed by those who live in constant fear of unemployment or are actually out of work . Unemployment lowers living standards . People move to cheaper lodgings , eat coarser food , and wear older clothing . Families keep house together in order to save rent . People  | who still have jobs find themselves swamped with appeals for gifts and loans . Other bad effects of a physical and psychological nature follow . Inadequate diets impair health by reducing resistance to disease . Those who are proud do not seek medical and dental care unless they can pay the bill ; the result is more ill health and deaths . The necessity of going on relief exercises an incalculable psychological effect on the present and succeeding generations . Unemployment breeds unemployment . People spend as little as possible when they are unemployed or when they fear that they soon may be . This causes production to slow down , which further increases unemployment and thus again decreases purchasing power , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological results are worry , disillusionment , fear , bitterness , and despair . It may cost the employer money to hire and to train a new man or to replace a man with a machine , but he need not deprive himself of some of the necessaries of life on this account . Loss of the worker 's services , even if they are not replaceable , results only in a decline in production , in a monetary loss , while decrease or loss of wages sharply limits the comforts and necessaries that the worker can buy . The average laborer can not afford to withdraw from the labor market for any length of time , because it costs money to live ; each month the grocer , the baker , the butcher , and the landlord must be paid . The laborer 's services must be sold at once . They can not he stored , for a day 's wages lost can never be regained . The earning years are relatively few ; in them the worker must rear and educate his family and save for his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in his later years , he must save regularly . This is possible only with a steady income . As  | he is at best able to save little , the worker can not afford to be without a job for any lengthy period . The worker can not sell his labor without agreeing to live under the conditions imposed by the job . These conditions affect his health , habits , skill , ideals , character , and entire outlook on life . When his way of life and his vocational skill have been molded , it is difficult for him to change . In other words , it is very hard for the worker to have to change his occupation . The employer can take advantage of the helplessness of labor in this respect .  | Even taking a job in another town means hardship for the worker . He must leave the community in which he and his family have built up social ties . In addition , moving is costly , and the average worker does not usually have the ready cash to go from place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advantage of the employer in the wage bargain . Only during recent years have we begun to create an organized labor market . An efficiently organized national system of unemployment offices makes it possible to keep workers informed as to alternative jobs and wages . The lack of such facilities causes unnecessary loss of time and anxiety on the part of thousands of workers . Skill and cleverness in bargaining are usually on the side of the employer , since he has a superior knowledge of market conditions . The employer can make questionable claims concerning the economic status of the business without being successfully contradicted . The average laborer has little knowledge of general business conditions , let alone the specific conditions in any industry , and so is handicapped in dealing with the employer .  | Are labor organizations important in your community ?

Has defense employment affected labor organizations in your community ?  | LABORERS try to strengthen their bargaining position in order to obtain higher wages , shorter hours , and better working conditions . They try to attain these aims by various methods . Workers have learned that they need to be educated and thrifty . Ignorant laborers have little choice of jobs and slim hopes of improving their working conditions . Labor leaders realize that thrift as well as education is necessary to strengthen the bargaining position of working men and women . If the workers spend all their income for immediate needs they have nothing with which to support labor organizations . Labor 's prime method of asserting itself is group action . It attempts to gain higher wages , shorter hours , and better working conditions by organizing into unions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality of bargaining power between themselves and their employers . The early unions in America were local organizations of men working at a single trade . The Knights of Labor , organized in 1869 , was the first successful national organization of workers . In its organization it ignored all trade distinctions and endeavored to unite all the laborers in different trades and industries . By 1886 this organization had a membership of almost 700,000 . Control of the Knights of labor was highly centralized . Because of internal dissension , the organization was practically dead by 1893 . The American Federation of Labor , founded in 1881 , is a federation of unions . The individual worker joins not the federation but a local trade union , which is chartered by a national organization of workers in the particular trade . More than a hundred of these national organizations are
