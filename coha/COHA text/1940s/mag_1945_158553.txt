The U.S. finally stood at the foot of the Hill of Reconversion . Last week that hill looked quite different from the way it looked a year ago . The shape of the hill , as it began to show itself to many businessmen from their present disadvantage point : <P> It is not as precipitous as it once seemed . Unless the Jap war ends with unexpected speed , half the hill may be climbed before V-J day . <P> This situation has the same advantage that chronic indigestion has over acute indigestion . It is not so dangerous or overwhelming , but its pains will linger longer and provide more opportunity for complaint as well as for alleviation . <P> As war production is cut back , first in one sector and then in another , business activity and unemployment may fluctuate violently and in different directions , from industry to industry and place to place . Some areas , some industries and some plants will work full blast while others face crises , and swift changes will continually alter the picture . <P> One reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to switch to civilian merchandise are not makers of goods but assemblers . But the makers ( manufacturers of steel , chemicals , textiles , etc. ) , who supply semi-finished goods to the assemblers ( manufacturers of automobiles , radios , alarm clocks , etc. ) , will still be tied up with war work till varying dates and in varying degrees . <P> Another reason for varying conditions is that pent-up demand for essential replacements will absorb some 1942 models ( the first off the assembly lines ) , but at some point the public will hold back and wait for the much publicized postwar models . This procedure may produce inventory problems for merchants ; it may also force manufacturers rapidly through two reconversions-first from war production to civilian production , 1942 style , then from 1942 to 1946 style . <P> It began to look less as if the economy would smash itself headlong into a cliff - more as if it were going to run into a series of unexpected , nasty potholes.               @ @ @ @ @ @
