L. I. Negotiations with Sperry officials are in progress . A shoe store has been installed in a Paterson . N. J. , aircraft plant by a subsidiary of Allied Stores Corp .

Because employers are willing to do most anything to cut down on the absentee rote. they are not charging retailers any rent for the space the stores occupy . Sales at these new branches az e increasing steadily , according to retailers . Individual sales run rather high , and at one store there have been several transactions of more than 5100 . So far . women 's wearing apparel , such us suits , coats , dresses and underwear , have been the most popular lines , though the demand is good for all kinds of merchandise . Sales on an Order Basis A large portion of the sales in these factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have the facilities at the war plants for carrying large inventories .

Two " Headaches " in Operation While department store executives naturally are happy over this chance to gain new outlets with a ready market , their enthusiasm is tempered by two rather pressing problems . The first is manpower . Store operators are having , enough trouble now trying to find help for their , regular stores and they wonder how they will stair these new outlets . At least one retailer has asked the assistance of the war firm in which it has a store . It seems probable that they will get together on some arrangement whereby a few employes of the industrial concern will heap in the retail store in - their spare time . They 'd be paid , of course . The other headache is the growing scarcity of merchandise .
