TIME Correspondent Robert Doyle toured the Suchow battlefield . His report : <P> The fine loess dust on the rutted dirt road from Suchow to the front , 25 miles to the east , was churned by our jeep into a long brown cloud which hung in the still air . We could hear the distant thump of artillery and the crunch of aerial bombs . Ahead and in some hills to the south , puffs of white billowed where shells and bombs found targets . In a village which had been retaken from the Communists the day before , an old peasant woman squatted at a roadside pond unconcernedly whacking at her laundry with a wooden paddle . Behind her on the mud wall of her burned-out hut the Reds , before they were beaten back , had splashed slogans in white paint : " Fight to Nanking ! " , " Land for the Tillers ! " and " Capture the liar Chiang alive ! " <P> We were met on the open road by a huge , red-cheeked adjutant who swung down from a truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the command post of Lieut . General Li Mi , commander of the Thirteenth Army Group . He pointed north toward a hill rising like the hump of a razorback hog out of the fields . The truck wallowed off the road through a shallow ditch and followed a telephone wire stretched across the parched , lumpy land , already sown with winter wheat . <P> " No Time for Luxury . " On top of the hill we shook hands with General Li Mi in front of his headquarters-a crude lean-to fashioned out of wooden poles covered with kaoliang stalks . He waved us to a rock ledge in front of the lean-to and said , with a grin , " Come sit with me on my sofa . " General Li apologized for the roughness of his quarters . " Every day I move , " he said . " We have no time for luxury . " Li wore a padded private 's uniform and a private 's winter helmet with the earflaps drawn up . <P> On order from the general , an orderly brought yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the general traced the Central China battle on the palm of his hand . Twelve miles eastward his old comrade , Lieut . General Huang Po-tao , was encircled in an area 3 miles in diameter around the rail town of Nienchuang . In eleven days of fighting Huang had lost 40,000 troops . From his position north of the Lunghai railway , General Li was punching east to relieve Huang . In a parallel position south of the railway , Lieut . General Chiu Ching-chuan 's Second Army Group was also pushing east . <P> On Li 's left flank , to the north , were four Communist columns under Red General Chen Yi . Chiu 's right flank to the south was menaced by another eight columns of Chen 's troops . Ahead , Li and Chiu faced three strong Communist defense lines between them and the beleaguered General Huang . " This is the bitterest fighting I have ever experienced , " said General Li . " I have orders from the Generalissimo to advance at any cost . Communists we have captured say they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In eight days Li had advanced ten miles . He had lost 200 officers , more than 8,000 soldiers .
