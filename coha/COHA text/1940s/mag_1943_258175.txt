' ' Comrades , " said Joseph Stalin in his calm , dry voice , " we have turned the course of the war . . . . The complete ousting of the Fascist invader is at hand . " <P> A few hours earlier Stalin had an nounced the year 's richest victory : the recapture of Kiev ( see p. 25 ) . Moscow 's walls echoed the jubilant salvos of 324 guns , the pealing of the Kremlin 's bells , the happy tumult of the crowds . Now , in Moscow and all over the land , men huddled before the loudspeakers to hear Stalin 's report on the triumphs already scored , on the prospects for tomorrow : <P> &gt; " Victory is near . But to achieve victory a new mustering of all forces . . . and decisive action of the Red Army on the front are necessary . " <P> &gt; " Our troops have liberated almost two-thirds of the enemy-held territory . " " The best German cadres have been destroyed and they can not get indispensable reserves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Instead of 240 enemy divisions ... on our front last year . . . now there stand 257 . . . . However , the defeat of German troops . . . shows the worsened quality of their divisions which can not be compensated by increased numbers . " <P> &gt; " The defeat of the German Army was decided ... at the end of last year . ... The Battle of Stalingrad ended with the destruction of an army of 300,000 men . . . . At the end of the Stalingrad battle 147,210 officers and men v. ere picked up from the battlefield and buried . . . . After the Stalingrad slaughter the Germans were unable to recover . " <P> &gt; " The fighting at Kursk last July witnessed the destruction of the main forces . ... It was the last German attempt to materialize the so-called German offensive . The offensive ended in a complete fiasco . ... If Stalingrad was a defeat .. . Kursk was a catastrophe . ; .. " <P> &gt; " Last year was the turning point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our industries . . . . The Soviet people quickly adapted themselves to wartime industry and succeeded ... in increasing and improving production in armaments . . . . Agriculture showed an output unsurpassed in history . " <P> &gt; " The day is not far off when we will completely liberate the Ukraine , and the <P> White Russia , Leningrad and Kalinin regions from the enemy ; when we will liberate . . . the people of the Crimea and Lithuania , Latvia , Estonia , Moldavia and Karelo-Finm'sh Republic i.e. , the parts of Finland ceded to Russia in 1940.
