txt Sir Oliver Franks , chairman of the European conference on the Marshall Plan , said today that the " valuable advice " given by United States officials would receive " full consideration " in the framing , of the conference 's final report . He referred to the severe criticism contained in a. long memorandum that William L. Clayton , United States Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs , had read to the executive committee of the conference Saturday . Although Sir 0/ilier used the future tense , the executive committee had already given " full consideration " to the advice Mr. Clayton relayed from Washington . It did so yesterday morning , when it drafted an 800-word outline for the conference 's final report . The outline , summarized in these dispatches yesterday , was influenced by the memorandum that Mr. Clayton had read to the committee . He thus communicated it orally , reading slowly so that the committee could take notes . But he declined to give the committee a copy of it . His reading of the memorandum and his own comments occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of the final report dealing with trade barriers concludes that a European cuotoms union would be a complex undertaking that I could be carried out only " by sucHessive stages extending over a certain number of years . " The report urges that because of the " important potentialities " of- ered by such a union , the governments should " undertake a minute and detailed study of the problems raised and the measures to be taken with a view to the formation of a general customs union or regional customs unions . " While it thus relegates customs unions to an indefinite future , the report , accepted by the representatives of the sixteen governments in conference here , appears to commit those governments for the first time to gradual elimination of the trade barriers involved in bilateral trade and payments agreements . These commitments are described in the report as follows : " When the difficulties of the balance of payments are gradually reduced , the countries represented n the Cooperation Committee the sixteen conferring nations agree to attenuate gradually the restrictions on their mutual trade . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the system of transferability of currencies takes effect , to begin immediately to permit freer trade in conformity with the principles of the International Trade Organization charter by means of such measures as the granting of unlimited quotas and general licenses for certain products * * " The governments of the countries represented in the Cooperation Committee agree to consult , as soon as the system of transferability takes effect , regarding the measures cited above directed toward the greater freedom of mutual trade in which these governments hope the other countries of Europe will join . " " These measures , " the report concludes , " are designed , when equilibrium in the balance of payments is realized , to lead to abolition of quantitative restrictions imposed either in Europe or in the relations of Europe with the rest of the world for reasons arising from the balance of payments . " The report emphasizes the need of multilateral trade and full use of labor throughout the world and urges governments to do their utmost to " raise their mutual trade above the pre-war level . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliges European countries to seek wider markets in other countries . Benelux Union an Example The report then cites the Benelux customs union , of Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg , as the " first effort to reap the advantages that neighboring countries may expect from closer economic association . " It adds that the creation of a " wider zone of free trade " would lead in many industries to higher output and expansion of trade in Europe and between Europe and the rest of the world . But , says the report , the " formation of such a zone could not alone solve the fundamental probwhich Europe is in constant deficit were disposed to increase their purchases of European goods . " " The only complete and lasting solution of this problem , " the report continues , " lies in as close an economic association as possible with the extra-European countries from which Europe receives the bulk of its imports . " A customs union can not be created by a stroke of the pen . Such a union , particularly if it were formed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical negotiations that could be carried out only by successive stages extending over a certain number of years . " The report describes quantitative restrictions on trade , resulting from bilateral accords , as the worst obstacles existing today . " The longer they continue the more it is to be feared that they will encourage uneconomic production , maintain artificial price levels and conceal the real relations between currencies , " says the report . But the report finds that it is " not possible to consider the immediate abolition of all restrictions on imports and exports among European countries " although the utility of such restrictions will diminish as production creates surpluses for export . " Gradual Removal " Stressed The report , therefore , emphasizes that the " gradual removal of balance-of-payments difficulties is essential to greater multilateral trade . " This removal is to result from freer transferability of currencies , as proposed by experts in a report adopted yesterday . To this end it is suggested that a dollar pool of some $4,000,000,000 be created . Sir Oliver said that the advice given by United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined as follows : " First , it is to be desired that the report indicate that by the end of 1951 Europe will have achieved a workable economy . " Second , any specific external aid should show progressive reduction during the four-year period and cease at its end . " Third , the participating countries should from time to time show evidence of progress toward the ' scheduled goals of production . " Fourth , the restoration of production the fullest use should be made of existing facilities , which should have priority over new , long-term projects . " Fifth , the participating countries might mutually undertake to achieve internal financial and monetary stability . " Sixth , the participating countries should work for an increase in trade and reduction of trade barriers with a view to their eventual eltnination along the lines laid down by the International Trade Organization charter . " Seventh , consideration should be given to the setting up of a multilateral organization of the participating countries which should review fulfillment of the program .
