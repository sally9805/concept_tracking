Whatever had become of postwar free trade ? <P> Only a year ago , the U.S. had still believed that economic and political freedom were inseparable in One World . Since then , political hopes have been dulled by continued East-West tension , economic hopes are hardly mentioned at all . In London last week , an international group met ( very quietly ) to discuss free trade . <P> The group : U.N . ' s Preparatory Committee of the International Trade and Employment Conference . It was significant that , in order to convene it at all , the sponsor ( U.N . ' s Social and Economic Council ) had to promise timid participating nations that the meeting would be truly preparatory , and that no commitments were expected from anyone . It would merely propose an annotated agenda for a future conference , which might get down to cases . <P> Can Harry Do It ? Even though the U.S. is currently the world 's chief ad- vocate of free trade , distrust of U.S. intentions is one of the chief reasons for other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim that they still do not know whether or how much or when the U.S. would be willing to lower its own tariff barriers in exchange for a relaxation of the Empire Preference system and British import restrictions . They know that the U.S. President has powers to slash tariffs as much as 50% , but they imply ( as politely as possible ) their doubts that Harry Truman could actually do so at the moment . <P> Another obstacle : the U.S. is the last more or less laissez faire nation in a world of controlled economies . The guardians of those other economies believe that U.S. freedom is really a wild lack of order which might endanger all who are in any way tied to U.S. economic policies . Thus the British have in principle agreed to the broad U.S. " Proposals for Expansion of World Trade and Employment " ( 1945 ) , but are balking at their specific implementation . Around the London trade conference last week , talk of additional controls was just as loud as talk of free trade . The Dutch delegation suggested that-not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( namely , full employment ) should be the conference 's main topic . The British even talked of instituting U.N . economic sanctions against nations which fail to maintain full employment . <P> The Empty Booth . Difficulties between the U.S. and Britain , however , are small compared to those between the U.S. and the rest of the world . As one U.S. expert put it last week : the London conference will have achieved a great deal if it merely manages to express our official free trade policies in terms that Czechs , Frenchmen and Ecuadorians can understand , even if they do not agree . <P> In London 's gloomy Church House , the ordinary kind of linguistic translation was proving difficult enough . Perhaps symbolically , the simultaneous interpreting system ( as used at Nrnberg ) , which was to be installed in the conference room at Church House , did not work last week . In glass booths , marked " English , " " French , " " Spanish , " interpreters were working merely for practice . The fourth booth , marked " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had declined to attend the conference " at this stage . "
