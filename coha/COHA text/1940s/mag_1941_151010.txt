ELLEN ROGERS-James T. Farrell-Vanguard ( $2.50 ) . <P> With this novel , James T. Farrell , tireless author of the Studs Lonigan trilogy and its sequels , moves from the noisy and redolent cellars of shanty Irish up into the parlor . <P> His heroine , Ellen Rogers , belonged to Chicago 's Catholic bourgeoisie . It was 1925 , and Ellen was bored . She was too lazy to keep up her horseback riding or her piano lessons . She could not make up her mind whether to go to college or not . She did not get around to reading much . But she did get some fun out of tormenting mediocre boys . She was clearly a setup for a ruthless and clever man whose egoism would outweigh hers . <P> Ed ( " Hellfire " ) Lanson 's mountainous egoism crushed hers like a mouse . A good-looking , powerful , self-educated fellow-Swinburne was his favorite poet ; Nietzsche was his god-Ed 's flood of talk was mostly a lurid rehash of his reading . Ellen was too ignorant even to understand much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good salesman , but he hated to kowtow to people , tossed up one job after another . He liked to stay away from home , living in hotels and boardinghouses . <P> Before long Ellen was reduced to a soft , whining , pleading , quivering mass of lust and fear-fear of losing Ed . Naturally he tired of this and left her , with studied brutality . Ellen made frantic , shameless , almost somnambulistic efforts to get him back , finally saw no escape from her agony but the night-black waters of Lake Michigan . <P> Like Dreiser , James T. Farrell writes with his thumbs . His words are blunt tools that he must wield with force and repetition . Some of his dialogues , about nothing in particular , seem interminable . The significance of Ellen Rogers is not in its writing but in the fact that here for the first time Farrell has contracted his view from social to individual conflicts , against the backdrop of a higher social milieu . He has succeeded after a fashion , like a strong but clumsy pugilist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blows .
