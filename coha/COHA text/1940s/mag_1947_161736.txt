Russian culture cops have been playing " Truth , truth , who 's got the Historical Truth ? " with a new Soviet film called Admiral Nakhimov , about a Russian naval hero of the Crimean war . After a private showing , the Communist Party 's Central Committee had growled : " The historical truth has been profoundly distorted , " ordered veteran Moviemaker Vsevelod Illarionovich Pudovkin to remake his film . <P> Fortnight ago , Pudovkin 's new , enlightened version appeared , stripped of frivolous love scenes and staggering with political significance . Purred Red Star 's Reviewer V. Ilienko : " The directors of the film have corrected their mistake . . . . He Admiral Nakhimov anxiously observes the events behind the scenes of European diplomacy , and knows where the real enemies of Russia are . " <P> Reviewer Ilienko , however , had failed to discover where the real critics of Russia were . Snarled Major General Glaktionov in Pravda : " The review of Ilienko . . . distorts the historic truth . . . . One might conclude that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known from history , the war against Russia was wanted by an Anglo-French coalition which Turkey entered . . . . " <P> Last week Moviemaker Pudovkin showed that he at last knew in whose fist the button of Truth reposed . Said he : " The directives of the Central Committee taught us a lot . ... It seems all these conclusions are so simple we should have known them before . "
