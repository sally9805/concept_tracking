Never Say Goodbye ( Warner ) is the one about a divorced husband ( Errol Flynn ) who loves his ex-wife ( Eleanor Parker ) , who loves him but **30;15888;TOOLONG , and their little girl ( Patti Brady ) , who loves , and is loved by , both of them , and will never let them hear the last of it . This situation , which is not unheard of in the home-loving U.S. , might have been the basis for a touching and impressive film . Or , in skillful hands , it might have been first-rate comedy . Those who made this version use all the known tricks , and invent a few new ones , for depriving it of both humor and humanity . <P> The American Cop ( MARCH OF TIME ) tackles a serious and very present problem : the booming postwar U.S. crime wave . But with all its cops- &-robbers; flavor of shrieking sirens , swinging nightsticks and hard-boiled violence , the film is as much fun as a fast whodunit . <P> When you come right down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , local policemen are the boys who do the hard , grubby job . As an example , the camera examines the New York City force , biggest of them all , whose rookies must pass a civil service exam and are schooled to be polite ( some of them are ) , resourceful , specialized . Exciting shots : sweaty , wholesome-faced New York cops beating the interns to an emergency obstetrical case , reviving a would-be suicide , tracking down a pair of slippery young hoodlum-killers . <P> Appassionato ( Lux-Saga ) is a genteelly lethargic Swedish-made film about a girl who is loved by one young and one not-so-young pianist . The middle-aged one never really has a chance . Few U.S. moviegoers will care particularly that this is a fairly dull-but well photographed-movie . What they will notice is the girl , Viveca Lindfors , auburn-haired alumna of the same Swedish Royal Dramatic Academy which gave Hollywood both Garbo and Bergman . <P> Miss Lindfors , 25 , wife of a Stockholm lawyer and mother of two small children , is already in California at work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sept. 30 ) . Appassionato , , with English titles , is being released in the U.S. for the benefit of cinemaddicts who can not wait to make comparisons . <P> Like her more celebrated countrywom en , Lindfors is a good-sized , healthy-looking girl with a rich , cello-toned voice . <P> She is no conventional beauty , but her face is founded on beautifully modeled , well-spaced bones . It will be a pity if Hollywood 's make-up experts are tempted to tamper with her thick , dark eyebrows and wide , expressive mouth . Her legs are all right as they are .
