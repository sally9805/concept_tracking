It looked as if Wendell Willkie had triumphed over the No. 1 political rule that you ca n't beat Somebody with Nobody . He was dead set against the isolationist Chicago Tribune 's candidate , Werner W. Schroeder , as chairman of the Republican National Committee , but he espoused no candidate of his own . The result was that when the Committee gathered in St. Louis it permitted Somebody in the person of Mr. Schroeder to withdraw gracefully after two ballots , then proceeded by acclamation to name Nobody in the person of Harrison Earl Spangler of Iowa . <P> Red-faced , 63-year-old Mr. Spangler girded himself last week to take command of the G.O.P. strategy that will lead it to 1944 . The unanimity with which he had been chosen was synthetic ; the harmony which he is supposed to stand for will be , at best , ersatz . For Mr. Spangler knew , as Willkie knew and as the Chicago Tribune knew , that no mere middle-course champion of compromise could ever span the gap within the party : between the Willkie wing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribune . <P> Chairman 's Progress . Harrison Spangler has been a stanch Republican wheel horse all his adult life . Only once did he slip his halter-when he became a Bull Mooser in 1912 . He worked up through precinct , county and district jobs to become National Committeeman in 1931 . In 1936 he bossed Alf Landon 's Chicago headquarters . In 1940 he backed Senator Taft 's Presidential aspirations . <P> Balding Winner Spangler made a double-jointed , fence-straddling statement . For the benefit of party progressives , he said : " ... We have n't the same world , with the modern bomber , that we had in the days of the 30-knot battleship . You no longer can say that the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are moats around America . " For the benefit of party diehards : " My job is to build up an army of voters in the United States to defeat the New Deal , and I do n't think there are any votes in China or Mongolia or Russia that I can get for the Republicans . " <P> Not victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's verdict . Said he : " My fight was to prevent the masthead of the Chicago Tribune from being imprinted on the Republican Party . I am happy that the result prevented that calamity . Mr. Spangler has a great opportunity for progressive public service . " <P> <P> * Cryptic note sent out by the Associated Press the night of Spangler 's election : " In Spangler background , first graf , read it ' X X X one of those party wheel horses , etc. ' ( deleting ' ideal ' ) . "
