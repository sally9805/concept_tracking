txt general ries , of the House Armed Services Committee hearings . Secretary anksanson is shown testifying . Gen. Omar l3radley , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of StaffCease Fire In ' Pentagon Battle ' A cease-fire was declared last week in the " Battle of the Pentagon . " Hearings were concluded Friday in a Congressional inquiry into the extraordinary dispute among America 's highest military authorities over what the nation 's defense organization and strategy should be . The inquiry was held by the House Armed Services Committee . There were two phases . First the Navy was given two weeks to state its case , and it did so vehemently . Then last week the Army , the Air Force and the top officials of the " unified " defense establishment were called to present rebuttals  --  and they did so with equal vehemence . The inquiry left large questions unanswered . There was the question of the future course of the " Battle of the Pentagon " ? for neither side seemed ready to yield its position There was the question of how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense establishment itself and in Congress . More immediately there was the question of personalities . The investigation brought to the surface deep feelings of bitterness among the nation 's highest professional military men  --  the Joint Chiefs of Staff . It left scars which raised doubts about whether the present Joint Chiefs could work together again . Changing Emotions The course of the hearings was reflected in the demeanor of the Navy men . At the outset their mood seemed to be one of grim satisfaction that they were having their " day in court . " Their confidence steadily rose . They came close to tears of pride when their case was defended . The atmosphere changed abruptly after the testimony on Wednesday of the nation 's No. 1 soldier , Gen. Omar N. Bradley , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . In his high , nasal voice he read rapidly a 15,000-word statement which said the Navy was in " rebellion , " and added : " This is no time for Fancy Dans who wo n't hit the line with all they have on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval officers looked stunned . But toward the end there was more conciliatory testimony by such figures as Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson and Dwight D. Eisenhower . The tension seemed to eases : least on the surface . The Issues The basic questions at issue in the " Battle of the Pentagon " are these : What kind of defense " unification " should the nation have ? Should the views of one branch of the armed forces be subject to veto by the others ? If a war comes , how ? should America fight it ? The questions have arisen in the framework of post-war " unification . " The framework is a single Department of Defense under a Secretary with over-all control , and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in charge of strategy . In this framework the Navy has charged that it is being " throttled " by a majority composed of the Army and Air Force . It objects to the ' JCS decision to give top strategic importance to the Air Force 's B-36 bomber armed with the atomic bomb  --  with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a budget battle : the Navy says it should have more of the budget dollar and the Air Force less . The list of witnesses before the House committee reads like a " Who 's Who in Defense . " These are some of the men who spoke for the Navy : Secretary of the Navy Francis B. Matthews . Admiral Louis E. Denfeld , Chief of Naval Operations . Admiral A. W. Radford , Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet . Admiral Chester W. Nimitz , former Chief of Naval Operations . Admiral William F. Halsey , wartime commander of the Third Fleet . These are some of the witnesses , in addition to General Bradley , who spoke for the Army and Air Force : Secretary of the Air Force W. Stuart Symington . Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg , Air Force Chief of Staff . Gen. J. Lawton Collins , Army Chief of Staff . Besides Mr. Johnson and General Eisenhower , these other witnesses testified : Gen. George C. isiarshall , former Army Chief of Stnff . Herbert Hoover , former President aid head of a commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the defense establishment . In their testimony the Navy and Army-Air Force witnesses ranged from polite protest to bitter recrimination . There were charges and countercharges that ran the whole gamut of defense organization and strategy . The sharpness of the controversy in the JCS was made clear . The Testimony These are the principal charges raised by the Navy and how they were answered by the other wit-nesses : DEFENSE ORGANIZATION Admiral Denfelii said : " Unification * * * does not mean merger , absorption , or elimination . Furthermore , unification should not mean that two services can control a third . Up to now there have been many instances in which that has happened ! ' General Vandenberg said : " In matters of strategy , the Joint Chiefs of Staff hold the position of primary authority . * * * All views can not prevail . Decisions must be made . " DEFENSE STRATEGY Admiral Denfeld said : " I do not believe that high-level strategic area bombing will attain for us the objectives of a war , not do I believe that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy losses . * * * Area bombing appears to me to be a costly , wasteful and unsure method of reaching the enemy vitals * * . " General Vandenberg said : " A prime objective of this country must be to find a counterbalance to the potential enemy 's Russia 's masses of ground troops other than equal masses of American and Allied ground troops . No such balancing factor exists other than strategic bombing , including the atomic bomb . " THE B-36 Admiral Radford said : " The B-36 * * * is a bad gamble with national security . * * * The unescorted B-36 can not hit precision targets from very high altitudes under battle conditions . " General Bradley said : " No Navy pilot has flown a B-36 , nor have they participated in any tests with this bomber . On the other hand , our Air Force bombardiers have assured us that this aircraft can perform effectively under all conditions of weather , by night or day , and can deliver striking blows against their targets . " THE ATOMIC BOMB Commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the atom bomb * * * is rather limited in its area of destruction . You could stand in the open at one end of the northsouth runway at the Washington National Airport * * * and have an atom bomb explode at the other end of the runway without serious injury to you . " Admiral Radford said : " The American people * * * would consider an atomic war morally reprehensible . " General Bradley said : " The insinuation that the atomic bomb is relatively ineffective as a weapon of war is refuted by every test that has been made . * * * As far as I am concerned war itself is immoral . * * * As a believer in humanity I deplore the atomic bomb 's use , and as a soldier I respect it . " - In the final two days , the contraversy lost some of its heat , The principal witnesses were civilians and retired soldiers , and these were the things they had to say : General Eisenhower : " We are expecting perfection in unification too quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . " Mr. Johnson : " The organizational structure which Congress has set up is a good one . It should be allowed to function . " General Marshall : " Unity is absolutely mandatory . " Mr. Hoover : " It requires a year for newly wedded couples to get used to each other . " These final witnesses were warmly applauded . In particular Committee Chairman Carl Vinson commended Secretary Johnson . This was regarded as significant in view of the fact that earlier Mr. Vinson had seemed to favor the Navy . The feeling was that the Navy had failed to prove its case . What Next ? The next step in the controversy is a report by the committee . Mr. Vinson said the committee would take a " vacation " and then write its report after the second session of the Eighty-first Congress convenes in January . What the committee will recomniend is uncertain . The feeling in neutral circles is that the investigation has two positive effects . It has focused public attention on the scope of the problem of security . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " among military men with sincere differences of conviction . But it is clear that the " Battle of the Pentagon " is not over . Indeed , the battle may grow more intense . The reason is that the total defense budget . which was around $14 billion this year , will be cut to around $13 billion next year . Thus the battle among the armed services for shares of the defense dollar may be more acute . Should the battle again burst beyond the confines of the defense establishment , Congress may be faced with the difficult task of refereeing technical military questions on which professional soldiers are unable to agree . They 're Not Speaking Moreover , military observers say the battle has already made personal relationships among the Joint Chiefs so difficult that some changes are inevitable . The personal friction was dramatized on Thursday when General Bradley and Admiral Radford suddenly came face to face in a corridor ; they turned their backs on each other without a word . In the discussion of changes the names most freN-.417 v./ 113 Johnson . Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in Navy circles ) and Admiral Denfeld . The problem is whether any other generals and admirals would get along any better .
