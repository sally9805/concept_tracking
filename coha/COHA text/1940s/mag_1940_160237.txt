In Chautauqua , N. Y. , under the sedate ministrations of the Chautauqua Institution , U. S. culture has flourished at its most earnest , its most uplifting , for nearly 70 summers . One day last week , Chautauquans cocked quizzical ears at the Miller Tower , * whose chimes are best known for Sunday morning hymn tunes . The chimes pealed . Oh , Johnny and Chinatown , My Chinatown . The pealer was impish , deft-fingered , blind Pianist Alec Templeton , who is equally good at Bach , boogie-woogie , musical satire , improvisation . Pianist Templeton , awakened that morning by the chimes , had asked leave to get back at them . <P> Chautauqua began letting its hair down last summer , when it heard housebroken " symphonic " jazz by Paul Whiteman 's orchestra . Last week 8,000 people jammed the acoustically excellent , open-sided amphitheatre to hear Pianist Templeton . He warmed up on classics , soon went to town with Grieg 's in the Groove . By the time he gave his irreverent impression of senatorial Dr. Walter Damrosch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chautauqua roaring its approval . <P> <P> *Named for Lewis Miller , one of Chautauqua 's founders , and donated by his daughter , Mrs. Thomas Alva Edison . She presided last week at the opening meeting of Chautauqua 's Bird &; Tree Club .
