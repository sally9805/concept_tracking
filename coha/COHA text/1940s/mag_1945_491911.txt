IT O REACH Frans den Vilders ' house from the press camp in the station square in Eindhoven would be no assignment to give an amateur in blackout travel . Setting out , you clambered over piles of rubble testifying to the efficiency of German demolition squads and the not always perfect aim of RAF bombardiers . Crossing the tracks involved no peril from oncoming trains , however . The trains were n't running . Station and yards were a lunatic mosaic of twisted , uptorn rails , fallen electric cable , bent power poles , broken glass and powdered brick . This was a German job , and it was a good one as such things are reckoned . Once across the tracks , the visitor was still faced by the problem of keeping on course , for the streets of *Eindhoven twist and turn and become narrow lanes without warning where blockbusters have ad-libbed . Where that has happened , the street is reduced to a one-way track between mountainous muck heaps , on either side of which the convoys pile up . If you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , and if your flashlight picked up the landmarks you had fixed on previous visits  --  the half-unhitched name plate on the doctor 's office , the boarded window of the little grocery and the dimmed red lantern which marked the army-service parking lot  --  you 'd come to Frans ' house sopping wet , because it had been raining since October and will rain until May unless the mercury drops . Then it will snow . Wetly . Frans is Eindhoven 's motion-picture magnate , currently a theater owner without a theater . The RAF fixed that for Frans , first in 1943 , when a Lancaster 's bombardier missed the corner of the adjacent radio factory and blew a chunk off the movie house . Franscame out all right that time . The Nazis fixed the place up , because they wanted to go to the show . But when the theater was hit again in 1944 , the Germans had other things on their minds , and Frans had been forced into retirement by the impact of explosive events . The local Goldwyn had n't worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it enabled him to place himself at the disposal of the underground , in which , just about then , he had become a part-time worker . Now he found himself free to work for the liberation of his beloved Holland and was one of those who had enjoyed holding a platoon of Nazis flat on their stomachs in the middle of the Vierstraat for several hours at the point of a tommy gun , the day the Yank parachutists descended like a swarm of locusts into the fields outside town . When the sky troopers marched in , the jerries were still there , burrowing their noses into the cobbles . The jail was full of quislings , and Eindhoven was dancing in the streets . That had been the pay-off after months during which Frans said he felt like a man supporting a mistress around the corner from home , lying about his activities and thinking he had concealed them from his wife and kids , Mrs. Frans smiled knowingly when friend husband talked that way . He could talk as he liked , but the big gossoon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had n't been happy months for the womenfolks , wondering , every time they heard sounds in the street , if that would be father coming home on a shutter with daylight showing through him . This was going to be a big night at Frans ' house . No further active participation in the war being wanted from the Orangi , Holland 's Maquis  --  the point having been made succinctly clear by the Netherlands Military Mission , sent over from London by the Dutch government in exile immediately after the liberation  --  Frans had time on his hands . Mostly , he had spent it rummaging in the ruins of his theater , since it was pointless for a man to rummage in the shops for such things as food for his kids , because food for Dutch civilians was and is scarce as teeth in a hen 's mouth . So Frans had climbed over piles of brick and timbers to break into his own property , and in a corner under his half-collapsed stage he had come upon what had been an extremely fancy radio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . From his friend Landrf of the adjacent factory he had cajoled a set of tubes . A young man in-the uniform of the Royal Canadian Air Force had driven around with a jeep , into which Frans had loaded the machine for transportation to the den Vilders abode , where a couple of days had been spent in persuading the instrument to work . This evening he was staging an official hookup ceremony by bringing in the BBC news for a trio of friends from North America . who would wash down the polite burblings from London with a bottle of schnapps . The magi arrived hearing gifts , not of frankincense and myrrh , but three cakes of soap for the lady of the house , canteen chocolate bars for the youngsters , and army-issue cigarettes for the host . The living room was cold , but the reception warm , and when the cakes of soap were broken out , madame said this was too much ; you should n't do these generous things . Her household had known no soap for three years and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows on Fifth Avenue put together . Milady 's youngest daughter did n't remember about soap , and when its purpose was explained by her lovely mother , the little girl 's eyes grew big and full of perplexity , and you could see she stood convinced that North Americans have not advanced to what might be regarded by a small girl of five as an adult and civilized condition . In honor of the festive occasion , Frans was burning the one electric light which the new overlords of Eindhoven permitted him to use for an hour each evening . Whether he had a permit to plug in the radio or not , nobody inquired . Everybody assumed an expectant expression while the host prepared the machine to receive the voice , and when it suddenly said : " This is London speaking , " all present sat on the edges of their chairs  --  the senior ladies of the household because they were thrilled by this re-establishment of contact between their own living room and the great world ; the visitors from the Western Hemisphere because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances . The young lady of five looked at the machine in popeyed amazement . You could see she did n't believe a word of it . So London gave us the news . About then , all manner of people were sounding off about the new freedom in Europe , and that night a BBC commentator was practically a jelly of emotion as he told about the joy he had seen on every face in Brussels a few days before . All the gentlemen present smiled as they listened to this stupendous pronouncement , but Frans ' grin was wry as the broadcast ended and he turned off the switch . " You have all been in Brussels , " he said to his guests . " Is it like this ? Is everybody so happy there ? " No , somebody said , it was not like this . Maybe it was like this for people who had money in their pockets to get around to night clubs and pay seventy-five francs for enough cognac to wet the bottom of a glass or shoot WOO francs on a dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back streets . And it was not Like this in the homes of people who must work and be paid or not eat , and who had practically abandoned eating as a habit since the Allies arrived , on account of the black market . Away from the hotels and the local Barbary Coast , where the same girls who had strung along with the Huns were now plying a thriving trade with the United Nations , Brussels was just like any other big town in the liberated areas . If you were seeking human misery in Belgium , as in Holland , no need to look far beyond the end of your nose . " What do you think of this liberation business , Frans ? " one of his visitors asked . " Are you satisfied with the way things are going ? " The host turned the question over in his mind long enough to light an American cigarette and take a couple of deep drags before answering . Dutchmen are like that . Dutchmen do n't say everything that comes into their minds , just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how much of it sticks . So , when a Dutchman says something , ten to one , what you finally hear is his considered opinion . And what Frans gave as his considered opinion of the state of the liberation could never be regarded as flattering to the political leaders of his liberators . The parachutists ' ? The soldiers on the ground ? The men of the aviation ? Wonderful ! But the politicians of your countries ? Forgive me , please , but no . That is what Frans said , not with heat , but with utter puzzlement . To any Tory-minded person , of course , such talk is the hallmark of an ingrate . The Allies had kicked the Nazis out of Western Holland , had n't they ? What more do these fellows want  --  fresh strawberry jam on the bread we give them ? The answer is that they want liberty , with particular emphasis on liberty of political action . As they see it , that is what they had been told they were going to get as soon as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dutch Attitude AS Frans recalled his thoughts on the day of libera- tion , he believed he was attending the resurrection of Holland . But as he saw it a little later , he was not so sure . The resurrected man , he said , soon awakened to find new chains on his ankles . They were not heavy , clumsy chains , like those with which the Nazis had bound their victims . They were slender chains , and they hung loosely , but they were still chains . And people do not like chains . Not Dutchmen , anyway . You gathered , from what Frans said , that we are booting away our chances in Holland , as the Nazis booted theirs in 1940 and ' 41 . The Texas boy from the airfield just outside town , who , in those days , was slinging rockets into German tanks and slicing railroad tracks over beyond Venlobut is n't any more , because he fell into a German flak trap three or four days after this meeting took place  --  looked puzzled . You could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes asked , " What do you Dutchmen want , more than we brought you ? " It 's the kind of question we who believe we are the saviors of democracy will always be asking . But Blakely , who fights the war with a camera , and has been known to ride in jeeps with the advancing armor of the United Nations to do it , said , " Go on from there , Frans . Tell us some more . " Our host said he was at a loss to understand the approach of the western democracies to the future of Europe . They seem unable to project their thinking beyond the national and racial boundaries of 1939 . They seem to take for granted that everybody in the occupied countries would rejoice to see governments in exile , the members of which had lived in England all through the years of bondage , take up where they left off . Had the Allies , then , learned nothing from France ? In France , they had been forced by events to accept de Gaulle and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ govern the country until free elections can be held , and had almost been faced with disaster by holding off too long . But in Belgium the Allies had flown all the old politicians , in power before the war , back to Brussels as soon as the Nazis had been driven out . Now they were trying the same game in Holland . ( Continued on rage 46 ) ( Continued from Page 10 ) " It is no good , " he said . " It wo n't work . " " But why not ? " the young fighter pilot wanted to know . " Who else could be put in charge until the whole country is freed ? " Frans looked baffled . Neither he nor any other loyal Dutchman thought you could hold elections the day after liberation , he said , nor until the Nazis had been expelled from every square mile of the Netherlands . After that , there must be a time of readjustment , no doubt . But in the meantime the people who had earned the right to leadership were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old men who had gone away . " You can not accuse Western Holland 's underground leaders of being Communists , " he added crisply , " and so try to brand them unfit to lead . Almost to a man they are conservative and Catholic . " The most charitable conclusion Frans felt able to reach is that our Intelligence had not kept London and Washington properly informed . " If you reject this , " he said , " you are forced to believe that Roosevelt and Churchill do not want us to be free , but simply to put us back under our old political masters . " Somebody said he could n't believe it . Were n't we all pledged to hold free elections as soon as possible ? " That is so , " the Hollander replied , " and the point is well made . But in the interval you should permit the men we want , not these old exiles , to direct our country 's affairs . That is what we had taken for granted would happen . These are the men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we most fight . Now they are pushed aside , and we can not understand it . The Germans missed their opportunity . Are you going to miss yours ? " That was a big one . You could n't let that one go by without taking a cut at it . It was Blakely who asked , " Now what do you mean by that crack , Frans ? " " You will never know , " Frans said thoughtfully , " how near Europe came to accepting the Nazis as well as being overrun by them . They came promising freedom within the walls of a federation of European nations . Within the federation , Holland would govern itself , so far as domestic affairs go . So would Belgium . So would everybody else . There was to be a central government to which each nation province would elect deputies in proportion to its population , and the central government would function only in matters relating to the common good . Customs barriers would be destroyed . We would become one big family , each branch running its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our saviors had disposed of their archenemy across the , Channel . " Frans turned and spoke to the young flier . " If you will think of your own United States , " he said , " you will know what we were promised , the United States of Europe , and it would surprise you if you knew to how many Dutchmen the idea appealed , It did so partly because we had been taken unaware by the enemy , because our own political and military leaders had left us and we were ready to grasp any straw of hope . But it still appeals to many of us as the only solution to the sickness of Europe . It is still a great idea . The only thing wrong with the 1940 presentation is that it came from the Nazis  --  and they did n't mean it . But we feel we must come to something like this , or Europe will uld come realizing this . But no. ypeonu.swholly the sword , and we believed You come bringing us the same men we had before , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us we must accept this and the people who support the old order in Europe until you are able to supervise elections .

" will bitWterhytowwearred mtheenglioykee drnmenentVilindeersils so exile ? oWylediaddersth  --  ey You findfitnhdeir t hbitternessviewpoint wherever you go in the liberated areas of Holland . To dismiss it as a case of warped vision does n't solve it . I t is a problem which has confronted us wherever we have gone inEurope , a problem for which we brought no ready-made solution with us and to which we still have not found the right psychological approach . Trying to fob it off as left-wing agitation or worse is no help , either . Such thinking simply adds to our own confusion , and the charge is almost totally invalid in the case of the Dutch anyway . But a rough outline of the impact of events on the minds of ordinary Dutch citizens may explain their unease . The first item to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stood out against the Nazis in the beginning . Overwhelmingly , the defeated population opposed any activity likely to arouse German anger . The citizen 's first concern was for his family , as it would be in America under similar conditions . Hence the hothead minority  --  and there were n't enough Dutch hotheads to fill is two-gallon hat in 1940 ? were more cordially disliked and feared by their fellow citizens than they were by the Nazis . These were characters likely to get everybody into trouble , and about that time the bewildered , unarmed and cowed Dutch wanted no part of trouble with anybody . Moreover , they had been taken aback by the good behavior of the Wehrmacht , by the Germans ' assurances that their only enemy was England , whither they were reputedly en route through Holland . The Dutch were enamored , too , of the promise of a federated Europe , in which each member state would enjoy autonomy in domestic affairs . Certainly none of this was what they had expected from the invader . The only ammunition the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these strong points was " Never believe a German . " It did n't go down with the people . The early Dutch resisters had more to fear from their own people than from the Huns , who were so strongly entrenched they could afford to laugh off the feeble efforts of Dutch patriots . What you had in the beginning , then , was minuscule re- a population mainly composed of passiv active ve collaborators , plus large numbers o sistance movement , Thenceforth , the growth o f resistance aralieledthe cline in German deportment , until finally Nazi o t terrorism whole of the passive-collaboration group into the resistance camp . The active col-laborators remained ' in that categoiy an moved a virtually rni lin gs a until the armies of liberation came storming up through Belgium , when all the quislings who could manage it lit out for Germany , and those who could n't tried to talk themselves out of the doghouse with their fellow citizens . People like Frans make no attempt to conceal what their own part was in the struggle for survival in bondage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had begun as passive collaborators  --  so passive , in fact , that when the Germans under Seyss4nquart began to get tough , these good burghers still urged conciliation and appeasement . What finally swung Frans over the chasm , for example , was to see a factory foreman , with whom he had played in the streets of Eindhoven as a boy , backed against a wall and Spandaued into eternity , without even being allowed access to the rites of his church . He had stood in the crowd drummed up by the SS  --  a crowd itself covered by the muzzles of Spandaus  --  and watched his friend pitch forward , dead . " From that moment , " he said bitterly , " I was a Dutchman again . " That did not happen until 1943 . The logic which leads the liberated Dutch to stand behind their resistance leaders is extremely simple logic . They do not merely say , " These men led us through the night . Now let them lead us in the dawn ! " They say , " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gave us the will to fight it . " They can not understand why we do not see the point . They believe their liberators ' leaders are working against the will of the people  --  and our problem is n't whether this assessment is right or wrong , but that the Dutch cling to it . The cameraman had been listening intently to Frans ' expos ? of the Dutch viewpoint . At the end , he said , " Maybe you 're right , but up in Nijmegen the other day the burgomaster was telling me he heard a broadcast from London saying the Queen is all set to give you democratic government again as soon as she gets the green light , and meanwhile aims to put a couple of resisters into the cabinet . Does n't that defeat your argu-ment ? " Den Vilders bit on the question hard before giving us another considered Dutch opinion . " The life of the so-called Dutch government expired in 1941 , " he said . " Since then , it has had no status . But queens do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end they lose their thrones . It is the people who choose leaders , and we have chosen ours . None of us suggests that these resistance leaders hold a mandate to cover anything beyond the interval between liberation and national reorganization . What we hold is that these are the men with whom your leaders should consult while the liberation process continues . AN the free area is enlarged , good Dutchmen from these regions should be taken in , until all Holland is freed and a national liberation committee established to govern until elections can be held . It is solely a question of men , not method . We want those who fought for Holland from within . You want those who left us . " " My God , Frans , " the young aviator asked with considerable heat , " do n't you even like the Queen any more ? " " It is not a question of liking or disliking her , " den Vilders replied . " Loyal Dutchmen accept her and her family as an institution we want to retain . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But why this great antipathy to the old boys who flew away to London before the Huns came ? " Blakely pressed . " They have n't done a bad job . They 've recruited Dutchmen from all over the world to fight for Holland . They 've administered your merchant navy . They provided a point of contact with the United Nations you could n't have had otherwise . Why so bitter , chum ? " The new note in Frans ' voice was one of plain exasperation . Obviously , these North Americans had n't been reading the European scoreboard as the game progressed . " It is not merely because they left us , " he said , " and we admit they have done a necessary job . But do you want the same Europe we had before ? Do you simply want to kick the Nazis out and go home , leaving conditions behind which will bring your sons back to Holland in twenty years with guns in their hands ? That is what will happen if the old men in all these countries hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , men of international outlook , who will support federation in Europe , no matter what name we use for it . We must have this or another war ! " As this is written , after leaving Holland , a fellow correspondent reemphasizes this as the view of the Dutch , held as strongly today as when these things were said a few weeks earlier in the Arnhem corridor . Wilhelmina 's decision to include two resistance leaders in a new cabinet will not solve the problem . It may give the old men a breathing space , more borrowed time to dig in , Frans himself had stressed this , as had the radio-factory manager , foremen , newspaper editors , farmers and housewives throughout the corridor . We were giving the old men a chance to re-entrench themselves . Much more of this and we 'd never dislodge them . This sounded like politics back home . This was the kind of talk which makes sense to a North American . The man in the driver 's seat has his hands on the wheel of the election machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war . But Frans had still another thought to air . " Perhaps the men with whom we shall replace the exiles will become like the old men in time too , " he said . " Ideas become more rigid as age increases . But now they have ideas and policies to fit the times we must live in . That is why we need them , and our Allies ' help . " " Frans , you 're a ruddy Socialist , or Communist , or something , " said the kid who would go down into a German flak trap , cleverly disguised as a truck convoy , four days hence . The lady of the house , thinking , no doubt , the time had come to cool the conversation out , came in with cups of weak tea , a beverage more precious than vintage champagne- in war-torn New York . Frans had dodsed the light bulb and we were down to a candle . We talked about cabbages and sealing wax , of soap and chocolate bars , and pretty soon the guests made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downpour . " Cripes ! " the young pilot said as we sloshed through the casual water of the street . " These guys have picked up a lot of queer ideas , have n't they ? " " Listen , pal , " Blakely answered , " if you 'd been sitting in Europe for four years , always being told by the Nazis to move over , maybe you 'd have picked up some strange ideas yourself . Maybe ? these people know more about the score than we give ' em credit for . Maybe they 've learned the hard way what freedom means . Or maybe they 're just plain bushed . But we better get a move on and find out "
