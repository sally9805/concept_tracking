Czechoslovakia last week had lost one of the democratic features of which it has always been most proud-its free press . By Government order , newspapers , instead of being privately owned , must henceforth represent political parties , trade unions , youth movements and other organized groups . They retain the right to criticize the Government and individuals so long as they do not impair the safety of the nation . <P> The job of providing a legal basis for this politicalization of the press fell to Minister of Justice Dr. Jaroslav Stransky , 61 , longtime associate of President Eduard Benes in Czechoslovakia 's pre-Hitler government . One of the papers whose seizure he must legally justify was his own Svobodne Noviny , - Free News .
