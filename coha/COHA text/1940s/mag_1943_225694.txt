To the body armor developed for the Eighth Air Force ( TIME , June 14 ) a new , lightweight protective helmet has been added . Like the flak suit , it is the invention of the Eighth 's smart air surgeon , Brigadier General Malcolm Grow , for protection against low-velocity missiles : flak , spent bullets , metal torn loose by enemy gunnery . <P> Known as the M-4 ( the standard tin hat for ground troops is the M-I ) , the steel-and-leather skull cap weighs but two pounds , compares in looks and comfort with the familiar football helmet .
