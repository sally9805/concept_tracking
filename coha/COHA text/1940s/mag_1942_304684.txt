This is no Henry Kaiser outfit . This is just a hell of a swell team and we 're cany-ing the ball . That 's all . <P> These modest words were spoken last week by a modest man : trim , 6-ft. , ruddy-cheeked Charles Cameron West , founder-owner of Wisconsin 's booming Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co. , who loves to stride around in muddy shoes , greet workmen by their first names-and build anything that goes to sea . A shipbuilder for 42 of his 65 years , Charles West never broke a Kaiser record , never stole a Kaiser headline . Yet last week he had his own claim to fame as the only inland builder of intricate , tightly packed , oceangoing submarines , was doing so well he had orders for enough of them to keep him going full blast until 1945 . <P> With a Cornell engineering degree in his hip pocket , Charlie went to work for Chicago 's American Shipbuilding Co. in 1900 , picked up tricks of the trade for two years , quit to buy an ancient , near-dormant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clipper shipyard since 1847 , and Charlie built one wooden ship for tradition 's sake , then switched to steel . To speed things along he rounded up a wide-awake , corner-cutting engineering staff , set up large machine shops to make boilers and engines , shape every piece of steel used in a West-built ship . Things went well until after World War I , when shipbuilding collapsed . The thing that " saved the bacon , " says Charlie , was the machine division , which promptly turned to heavy items like industrial cranes , dredges , cement and paper-mill machinery . <P> Soon as World War II broke on the world Charlie gleefully turned back to his first love-ships . He dickered with the Navy , in the summer of 1940 landed a $32,800,000 contract for ten submarines . Then he got to work , converted his own plant and 60 subcontractors to submarine building . Because Wisconsin winters are finger-numbing cold , he makes the submarines piecemeal indoors , assembles them in 15 sections , weighing from 38 to 68 tons each . His first submarine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Navy was surprised , promptly gave West a huge contract for invasion barges . West drew the plans , farmed out the work , and delivered the whole fleet only eight months after the contract was signed . Watching his progress , the Navy was flabbergasted , gave him a big pat on the back , a Navy " E " and contracts for many more submarines .
