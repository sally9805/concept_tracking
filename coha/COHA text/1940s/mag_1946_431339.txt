ON THE coastal flatlands a few miles south of San Francisco the earth begins shaking now and then ; to the uninitiated it feels disquietingly like an earthquake . When the dishes rattle , residents of the area know that the world 's biggest wind tunnel , two or three miles away , is twisting up air velocities more than twice as high as a mere hurricane . The man-made wind creates vibrations in the foundations and walls of the tunnel . These are felt , oddly enough , only at a considerable distance . In the immediate vicinity of the tunnel the senses resolve the vibrations only as a roar . The world 's biggest tunnel is one of several in the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics devoted to research in aircraft performance . One of its sister tunnels makes a rumble that is heard four miles away . Another emits a shrill whistle . These tunnels , at Moffett Field . Sunnvvale , California , are eight among a hundred in the United States , and today , for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run them are able to open their sanctuaries to the eye of the citizen and taxpayer who footed the bill for them . Up to now the national security forbade it . Strange things have occurred in the sixodd years since the doors of the tunnels were padlocked . Fundamental research in aircraft shapes has abandoned aerodynamics for ballistics . The laboratory winds have reached and gone beyond the speed of sound . The airplane , as yet , has not managed to fly as fast as sound . In the world 's biggest tunnel nine tons of captive air are driven around a squared raceway by 36,000 horsepower . That is the sum of the power in six great motors . Each of the motors would drive a Santa Fe Super  | Chief . Yet this tunnel is not a fast one ; the air moves at only 250 miles an hour . The tunnel is big to permit research engineers to test full-size airplanes . The throat , or test section where the planes are mounted to be introduced to the blast from the fans , is half again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-story building ( see cover ) . Essentially , wind tunnels are only devices for simulating flight under controlled conditions . The aerodynamicists , probing for information as a physician probes for the cause of illness , move air around planes or parts of planes instead of moving the planes through the air . Tunnels come in all shapes , sizes and characteristics of air flow . Some are tunnels in name only . Some are built solely to obtain a smooth flow of air ? one of low turbulence . Some are built for high " Mach numbers . " That simply means speed . A tunnel capable of circulating air at a Mach number of .8 has a speed of 608.4 miles an hour , or 8/10ths of the speed of sound in " standard air " ( air at a temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit at sea level density ) . Some tunnels are built for high " Reynolds numbers . " That simply means - a low disparity between the performance of a model airplane under test and the same thing in full scale . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One type , erected vertically , is used to find out how quickly model planes will recover from spins . The controls are " crossed " to produce spins , and at a given moment they are neutralized by clockwork , or by magnetic controls . Movie cameras record the performances . Another type determines the " flutter " characteristics of models , in Freon gas . Flutter is exaggerated vibration . In still another type of tunnel , at an N.A.C.A. installation in Cleveland , the temperature and pressure can be controlled for purposes of hairline accuracy in readings up to a simulated altitude of 38,000 feet . Beyond that the pressure can be dropped to equal 50,000 feet while the temperature is held at - 48 degrees F. This tunnel produces 500-milean-hour winds . The speed to be attained in a tunnel largely determines what material it will be made of . Cement-asbestos sheeting suffices in the big Ames tunnel because the air velocities are not high . Little efficiency is lost through friction . But when speeds go to 600 miles an hour or more , welded steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A little tunnel producing a 1,500-mile velocity has a throat that is machined as finely as the balance wheel of a watch . The estimate alone of the power required for a given tunnel is a neat piece of engineering . That depends in part on the mass of air to be moved . The mass in the big Ames tunnel is 24,000,000 cubic feet , or more than three times the capacity of a dirigible the size of the Hindenburg . It also depends on the velocity required , the efficiency of the propellers and motors , and the " losses " in circulation . The losses occur in friction and compression as the air is forced around corners . Friction is a major problem . If the air flow is extra fast , the tunnel walls have to be refrigerated . In low-velocity tunnels the temperature is kept constant by exhausting part of the stale air in each circuit of the tunnel and bringing in fresh air through an " exchanger " . The humidity is controlled by  | making the air pass through moisture filters . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are needed for an added reason . Velocity and low temperature and pressure cause condensation ? plain fog . Particularly in supersonic tunnels are driers needed . If fog occurs , the cameras intended to record the shock waves forming on a model under test may pick up only condensation waves instead . Before temperature controls were instituted the men working in the tunnels had a rough time of it . The air in one Langley tunnel would shoot from a normal summer 85 degrees to 139 degrees , and workmen changing models had to strip to the waist . The addition of a heat exchanger dropped the temperature to a bearable 105 degrees . Heat is not the only discomfort . In highpressure tunnels men ca n't smoke . If they light matches the dense air produces a flame a foot long . A cigarette is good for only two  | drags . Then it 's gone . And if , in a lowpressure tunnel , someone suddenly hits the stop button on the motors , the men inside are in momentary agony . A " rate of descent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The men who do the testing work inside the tunnel structure but , of course , outside the thundering flow of air . But there have been instances in which a man has entered a tunnel while it was in operation . Photographers , anchored like window cleaners to the tunnel structure , have braved 100-mile- an-hour flows to snap realistic pictures . Dr. Clark Millikan , making some observations in the Cooperative Wind Tunnel at the California Institute of Technology , suddenly was seized by a 150-mile-an-hour wind . Frantically but futilely grabbing at the smooth , steel slope that led to the throat , he skidded past the big window of the control room . A workman saw him clawing and switched off the fans . Dr. Millikan stopped short of the blades of propellers whirled by four motors aggregating 12,000 horsepower . With the coming of peace the nation 's wind tunnels that were used for applied research for combat superiority are once again being devoted to what they were intended for ? fundamental research . This type of research is concerned only with shapes and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Priority Number One project in fundamental research is the production of shapes that will fly at speeds far beyond that of sound . Once a body in flight reaches the speed of sound , it ceases to be a wing and becomes a bullet . That means that a fresh approach must be made to the science of ballistics . The men who make tunnels got ahead of the men who make airplanes in the field of speed by filching some secrets from nature and by impudently circumventing nature . They discovered , for instance , how to simulate speeds above that of sound . The speed of sound always was a ghostly barrier athwart the path of engineers seeking velocities of thousands of miles an hour . That was because shock waves formed . The air piled up . Constipation set in . The tunnel men put models in a compressed helium-gas gun and shot them into a tank containing Freon gas . The speed at which they could be shot depended on the speed with which the gas would flow out of a pressure chamber , through a tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn by the speed of sound in helium ? about 1,360 miles an hour . Helium would flow through the tube faster than air , hence its use . Under **26;524;TOOLONG pressure , the helium catapulted the models into a gas where the speed of sound was only 340  | miles an hour . Thus a simulated speed of about 3,000 miles an hour was reached . The engineers did create actual wind velocities of twice the speed of sound . When the velocity of the air just about reached the speed of sound and the air itself was jamming up in a constricted section of the tunnel , they suddenly gave it space to expand in . That boosted the velocity twice . The law that the engineers took advantage of was Bernoulli 's : In a streamline flow , the greater the speed of the air , the less the pressure . While the tunnel engineers have achieved such speeds , they are still stumped by some of the problems posed at an intermediate point ? the speed of sound . They can make air go at 760.5 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the flow . Until recently the transsonic area , from approximately 680 to 840 miles an hour , was a complete blind spot . It was hard to obtain flow readings in this range because of interference waves . A shock wave produced by a model would hit the sides of the tunnel and bounce back on the model or on itself . Only when the air passed into the supersonic range did the interference waves occur behind , instead of on or near , the model .  | The Germans apparently did not know what U. S. scientists now know about transsonics . They know that at sonic speed the ' stick forces " in a cockpit reverse themselves . They know in general what tomorrow 's supersonic wing will look like . It will have a sharp , instead of bulbous , leading edge , like an armor-penetrating bullet . It may be swept back radically like the paper airplanes boys fly in the schoolroom . Or it may be swept forward . It will generate some 400 degrees of heat by friction at 1,500 miles an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that information came out of one of Langley 's high-speed tunnels with an eight-foot throat . Engineers contrived to get interference-free readings out of so big a tunnel at sonic speeds by boosting the motor power , running the tunnel up to the " choking " point and then jamming the air on through until the shock condition was beyond the test section . That U. S. wind tunnels have solved perhaps the most pressing of the problems of transsonic and supersonic speeds is indicated by the tacit admission that an airplane " capable " of supersonic flight will be constructed and flown before the year 's end . Higher tunnel speeds are coming . To the rowdy , noisy 1,500-mile-anhour tunnel at Ames will be added this month a sister tunnel to produce velocities above 2,600 miles an hour . It will be still noisier , so noisy that it will have to be fitted with a muffler . This tunnel will represent as much research in tunnel design as it will ix supersonic flight shapes . That may be only a beginning . The tunnel men , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds of 7,000 miles an hour .  |
