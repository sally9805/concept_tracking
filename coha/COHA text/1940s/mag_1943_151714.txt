For the first time the big , jagged teeth of the Smith-Connally-Harness Act bit down . They caught not their intended prey , mastodon John L. Lewis , but 30 small-fry officers and members of United Mine Workers locals . <P> John Lewis ordered his miners back to work as Congress prepared to make the bill law over Franklin Roosevelt 's veto . They went back for the third time in two months , still without a contract . But back they went , more than 500,000 of them . <P> In the captive mine region around Uniontown , Pa. , where coking coal is dug for nearby mills that own the mines , Lewis ' order did not stick . First at Brownsville , then at Uniontown , groups of miners worked against union officials who were trying to get them back into the pits . When local election on the question brought a mixed result , self-appointed pickets roved from shaft to shaft , arguing , pleading , jeering at the returning workers , Thus , at the height of the outlaw strike , 24,000 miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons for 18 days . Since this type of coking coal can not be bought on the commercial market , furnaces stood idle at five big steel companies . <P> Pressure to crack down came not from Washington but , apparently , from the steel companies owning the captive mines , and from commercial coal operators who feared the strike would spread . Last week a Federal grand jury brought in the first indictments under the Smith-Connally-Harness Act , which makes it a criminal offense to attempt to strike a Government-operated industry . <P> The indicted U.M.W. members have received no support from U.M.W. Local , district , and international treasuries are flush , but the miners have had to find their $1,000 bond money elsewhere ( some from professional bondsmen , some from community storekeepers ) . John L. Lewis knows that aid for the indicted miners would infuriate a sizable percentage of U.M.W. members who resented the outlaw strikes and an even larger percentage of U.S. citizens who consider such strikes near treason . Local leaders believe that the sly Old Man of the Mines , considers these cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or without U.M.W. , the indictments will almost certainly lead to legal actions which will test how enforceable , how constitutional the Smith-Connally-Harness Act is . The U.S. got one indication of this last week .
