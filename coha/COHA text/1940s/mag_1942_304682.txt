For some years now elephantine Pan American Airways has been trying to slap down a persistent gadfly , New Zealand-born , onetime barnstormer , Lowell Yerex . But all that the slapping has accomplished so far is to make Yerex , founder and president of TACA ( Transportes Aereos Centre Americanos ) , fly more and buzz louder ( TIME , Sept. 28 ) . Last week the buzzes crescendoed before a hearing of the Civil Aeronautics Board when Yerex appeared to ask for a license to fly scheduled routes in what Pan Am considers its exclusive territory-the Caribbean . <P> Behind Yerex ' request lay good cause . <P> Already he is in fact flying both freight and passengers between Central America and Miami on a charter basis . Moreover , he has of late won support from under-airlined Brazil by flying strategic materials in and out of Rio ( two months ago he formed a $500,000 subsidiary , one-third owned by Brazil 's famed Taves family ) . In addition his year-old British West Indian Airways has relieved the hard-pressed West Indies by carrying an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,300 Ib. of mail a month out of Port of Spain , Barbados , Tobago . <P> Moreover , Yerex ' request for a license coincides with : 1 ) a Caribbean transport bottleneck so severe as to make it hard for CAB to turn down any airline equipped to fly there ( and also hard for Pan Am to continue claiming that it could handle the job all alone ) ; 2 ) a backlog of U.S. Army as well as South American good will for rush jobs he has been doing . <P> Nevertheless , Yerex still has one great stumbling block in his path . Since he is still a British subject ( and TACA a Panamanian corporation ) TACA must somehow be " Americanized " to suit the letter of the law . To CAB Yerex divulged a plan he had worked out to do just that : he wants to put all his TACA stock ( over 85% ) into a voting trust , to be engineered by Investment Bankers Schroder Rockefeller &; Co . Over half the stock would be owned by Americans and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. citizens-among them Schroder Rockefeller Vice President Avery Rockefeller , whose second cousin Nelson is now officially the U.S. 's No. 1 good-neighbor man . Under this deal Yerex could be outvoted four to one by U.S. citizens . <P> This program would seem to wrap TACA up in the American flag for keeps . Nevertheless , whispers still flew about " sinister British influence . " One whisper ( that Schroder Rockefeller is controlled by London 's famed banking firm of J. Henry Schroder &; Co. ) was not hard to answer . For under terms of the plan American individuals ( not Schroder Rockefeller ) would boss TACA . Another objection had more substance : Yerex would still own all of British West Indian Airways and one-third of TACA 's Brazilian offshoot . <P> At week 's end it still seemed possible that Yerex could work out a reorganization to meet this objection . But whether CAB would give him a license in the face of stiff Pan Am resistance remained to be seen . Only one thing was quite sure : <P> <P> Yerex ' planes will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already served the U.S. Army too well to be grounded-Americanized or not .
