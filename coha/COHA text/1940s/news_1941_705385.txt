txt The following letter from London was written by a former Master of one of the famous Liveried Companies of England , a recipient of the Order of the British Empire . It tells , in part , of the damage wrought by Nazi bombers on some of the ancient Guild Halls , which were architectural masterpieces of the British capital . It is 9 o'clock on Saturday night . " Wailing Winnie " has let off her " beastly banshee . " The guns are banging . My daughter is driving her ambulance  --  or at least I suppose so . She left at 7 P. M. and will not return home until 9 o'clock Sunday morning . A long shift for a young woman , but she certainly enjoys the work , as she feels she is doing her bit . The ordinary people one meets are naturally mad at the wanton destruction and are very determined to see Jerry get his full deserts . They are so very brave . They go about their business apparently without fear and , in spite of the destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hears a person grumble . Bombed Out Twice at ' 70 Only on Friday last ? at a meeting of the Commissioners of Taxes , at which I was present officially  --  a gentleman , considerably over 70 , asked not to be kept long as he had been bombed out twice and had an appointment to try to ' get some other premises , so that he could carry on his business . When we commiserated with him his only remark was , " Well , it ca n't be helped . It is all in the war , " and then thanked us for letting him get away quickly . The raid on the City of London on the night of Dec. 29 was so very wicked and sad . So many beautiful and historical buildings were badly damaged or destroyed . The ancient Guildhall wrecked  --  six Wren churches with their irreplaceable treasures , such as Grinling Gibbons 's beautiful carvings , are gone ? and many of our old but very beautiful Livery Companies Halls either very badly damaged or destroyed completely . Among them were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Fishmongers ' ( besides London Bridge ) , the Parish Clerks ' and the Barber Surgeons ' Halls , the latter considered one of the most beautiful small halls in the City , dating back to about 1650 . I have not seen it , but I believe the Brewers ' Hall was also damaged . Lastly , but not least , the Bakers ' Hall was completely destroyed . This hall , with its beautiful paneling , dates from 1719 . The carving and ancient fitments were very delightful . Over the Master 's Seat in the Court Room was a beautiful coat-of-arms of the company  --  carved from one piece of oak and enameled in true heraldic colors  --  made in the reign of James I. And at the other end of the Court Room the royal arms , similar in size and workmanship , all gone . In case it is not quite clear to you , I thought perhaps it would be interesting if I gave a short synopsis of the history and work of the Worshipful Company of Bakers , whose hall was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City . The reason for it being situated near the Tower is , I think , interesting . When the Romans landed in London they landed at Belling 's ( Gate ( now Billingsgate , the fish market ) and took their tolls on some ground at the eastern side of the gate , and all through the ages the kings of this country have taken their tolls on the same spot . It is now the Customs House . Such is the continuity of tradition . Farthing Loaves When William the Conqueror ( 1066 ) was permitted to enter London on condition he give the famous charter to London , which is the foundation of all the governments of the free peoples , he moved to the fortress which is now known as the Tower of London and considerably enlarged the fortress to overawe the City . Then , fearing risks , owing to famine , he ordered the Company of Bakers to house themselves as near the Tower and ' his Customs House as possible and bake a " tourte " ( brown or coarse ) loaf to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , several pounds in weight , but , of course , money was of much more value then . Anyway , the Bakers ' Company has been in the same vicinity ever since . The company controlled the price of bread for London and twelve miles around up to 1821 , and during the whole time the price of a loaf was always One penny . When wheat advanced in price the size of the loaf was small , and when the price of wheat fell the loaf was larger , the size being fixed by the Assize of Bread , who were responsible to the Lord Mayor and the Court of Aldermen . The company is still in close touch with the industry and does much to encourage the making of best bread . Its gold medal for the best loaf is considered the blue ribbon of the industry . Despair Lacking It is all so sad  --  but buildings are not our souls and , like the Phoenix , they will rise again front their ashes  --  more beautiful , if possible , than ever . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all the wickedness , and , although business is very difficult , we carry on and keep smiling . Every one in this country is very grateful to your great country and to your good President for all the help and assistance you are giving us to defeat the common enemy , so that when the war is won the free peoples of the world will be able to go about their legitimate business in peace and happiness : My personal remark is that , although comparisons are odious , if my countrymen are not too comfortable and happy , Hitler is certainly not as happy as we are and ? I 'll take my oath  --  Musso is more unhappy still ! P. S. ? Sunday night , 8:30 . There is a hell of a raid on . Some bombs have fallen and the guns are banging like blazes , but in all sincerity , I thank God , my people are safe up to now . Cheerio !                    @
