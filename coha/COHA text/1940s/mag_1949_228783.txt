Near the little ( pop . 1,500 ) mountain town of Rifle , Colo , last week , a five-year-old federal experiment reached an exciting climax . The Bureau of Mines announced that in its test plant it had produced oil from oil shale at a cost of $2 to $2.50 a barrel , comparable to the cost of petroleum pumped from the ground in east Texas . " We 're over the hill now , " crowed Plant Superintendent Boyd Guthrie . " We have the processes and the know-how . . . We 're positive we can produce equal or better products than you can get from petroleum . " <P> Experiments in Colorado date back to 1926 . They were abandoned in 1929 as unnecessary when new petroleum reserves started coming in , were revived during the wartime oil shortage . At that time Congress appropriated $30 million for large-scale research in synthetic fuel . It seemed a good gamble ; geologists estimate that U.S. shale reserves might yield 365 billion barrels of oil , enough to fill U.S. industrial needs for 180 years at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used at Rifle is simple . The shale is blasted from the surrounding cliffs , run through a rock crusher , burned in retorts ; the gases given off in this process are distilled into oil ready for the refinery . <P> Some big problems must still be licked . One is the lack of water needed for refining . All big U.S. shale deposits lie in the most arid sections of Colorado , Wyoming and Utah . Another problem is the question of ash disposal : more than a ton of ash is piled up for every barrel of oil produced . <P> Despite these problems , some big users of crude are about ready to go to work on shale oil on a commercial basis . Union Oil Co. of California has 14,000 acres of oil-shale lands , hopes to build a plant which will produce 200,000 barrels of oil a day .
