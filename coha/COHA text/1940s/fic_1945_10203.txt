and stared at the old young-man 's face that stared back at him from the glass . It was a strong face , well-boned and deeply tanned , but the fine lines at the corners of eyes and mouth were too many and too deep and the flesh over the cheekbones was drawn tight and thin . At the moment , he thought wryly , it was a face a good deal the worse for time and sleep ; a day 's growth of stubble bristled on the long line of his jaw , and his black hair rose in a ruffled crest on his head . His dark eyes seemed , somehow , a little darker and larger than they should be . They gazed back at him steadily  --  almost too steadily  --  like the eyes of a man who has had the right number of drinks and then one more . Leaving the mirror , he went to the window and looked out . The air was filled with thick gray fog . He could see the faint outline of a near-by tree and , below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these there was nothing . He turned and stood looking again , one by one , at the objects in the room . Then his eyes fell on a chair in the corner . There was a pile of clothing on the chair , but it was not his flying clothing . There was a pair of heavy brown worsted trousers , a maroon woolen sport shirt , a belt , a pair of clean underdrawers and a light-tan pullover sweater . On the floor in front of the chair were a pair of walking shoes , with gray woolen socks tucked into them . His eyes searched the room again , and he opened the door of a cupboard behind the bed . His own things were not there . After a moment 's hesitation , he removed his pajamas and began putting on the strange clothing . The shirt was tight around his chest and shoulders , and the worsted trousers were too short ; but the shoes fitted him almost perfectly , and once the pullover sweater was on he felt moderately well clothed and comfortable . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the washstand , splashed his face and head , and smoothed back his hair . Then he crossed to the door and opened it . A long , dimly lighted hall stretched away before him . He walked down it slowly , between two rows of closed doors , his shoes tappingloudly on the uncarpeted hardwood floor . Presently the hall turned and widened , and he was descending a flight of stairs . Halfwaydown , he stopped suddenly and stood staring at the small discolored gouge which his hand had touched on the smooth40bannister railing . Then he continued down the stairs and crossed an empty foyer into an empty , oak-panelled lounge . Here he stopped again and looked slowly around him , as he had done upstairsin the room in which he had awakened . His eyes fell on the wide French windows that formed one of the walls of the lounge , He went over to them , opened them and stepped outside . Instantly the fog closed in around him in a weaving , gray veil . There were ten yards of damp lawn before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall ; and beyond them nothing . A woman , or perhaps it was a girl , was sitting on the wall . She held some sort of pot or vessel in her lap , over which she was bending , but she put it aside as she heard the sound of the door closing and raised her head . Ordway took a few steps toward her and stopped . She watched him silently for a moment ; then she arose and approached him . " Hello , Martin , " she said . Ordway stood motionlessly , looking at her . He stood looking at the straight , slender figure in tweed skirt and white shirtwaist ; at the soft , oval face ; at the short , coppery hair bound back in a green ribbon ; at the full mouth , the small uptilted nose , the widespacedgray-green eyes . He put out his hands and took hers and held them , standing silent and motionless again . " Hello , Carla , " he said at last . They stood beside the wall , and his eyes moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the white gables piercing the mist above . " I 'm here , " he said . " Yes , Martin . You 're in Kandermatt . " " And you 're here . " " Yes . " They were silent again . " Did you know it last night ? " she asked . " No . " He paused , shutting his eyes . " That is  --  I 'm not sure . It seems to me now that I did . There was a moment in the plane , just before I jumped , when I imagined I was . . . . And then later , coming down . . . . I thought my mind was playing tricks on me . I guess I thought I was dying . " He paused again and opened his eyes . " What happened ? " he asked 41 " You came clown in the pasture on the other side of the road . Anrlrr.rs was out , looking after one of his goats that was sick  --  " " 1 lien It was Andreas ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came and woke Herr Knubel , and the two of tlrcur managed to carry you up here . They did not @nuw who you were until they got you inside . " tolway passed a hand over his eyelids . " I  --  I do n't remember  --  "  --  Hwy ' said you were barely conscious . You were talking about palls of planes and calling for people . At first they thought you were badly hurt , but when we got you upstairs and undressed we saw you were just exhausted . Frau Knubel kept wanting to wake you up and make you eat and drink something , but you just lay there breathing long and slowly , and slept and slept . " " What time is it now ? " " About four in the afternoon . " " Then I 've been sleeping  --  " " Almost fourteen hours . It was just after two when they brought you in . " Ordway stared out across the wall into the gray banks of mist . " When I first looked out the window I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dawn  --  evening  --  any time . " " The clouds closed down early this morning . Usually when it 's like this it clears by evening . " " For the Blue Hour . " ' The Blue  --  ? " She stopped suddenly , her eyes full on his face . Then she looked away . " Yes , " she said presently , " it should clear later . " There was a silence between them , and Ordway again passed a hand slowly over his closed lids . When I open them , he thought , she will be gone . When I look at her again all that will be there will be the mist . " Do you feel ill , Martin ? " she asked . He opened his eyes . She was there . " No , " he said . " I 'm just a little tired , I guess . A little  --  well-lost . " " But you are all right ? " " Yes . I 'm all right . " There was another silence . " Andreas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Frau Knubel . They 're still here . " " Yes . " " And the others ? " " Most of the villagers and guides are still here . Mr. Radcliffe still lives in his bungalow up on the Aarntal Path . " " Old Nick and his rocks . . . . And Mrs. Meach ? " " Yes , Mrs. Meach too . " " How about the others ? " " The others are gone . " " The Bauers , the Wilsons , Major Austen-Fellowes , the Jacqui-mots ? " " All gone . " " And Stefan ? " She averted her eyes again . " No , Stefan is not here either . " He stood quietly for a moment , looking down at her . " But you are here , " he said . She did not answer . " And your father and mother ? " She shook her head . " I am not here as a guest any more . I work here now . " " Work ? " " Around the inn . For Frau Knubel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just dull woman 's work  --  housekeeping , marketing . There 's nothing to tell about it . " She looked up at him again and her voice suddenly changed . " Tell me about yourself , Martin ? You are a soldier now ? A flyer ? " " Yes . " " You have been in Europe long ? " " Almost two years . Counting England and Africa . " " And you are  --  " " A bomber pilot . With the American Army Air Corps  --  in France . " Ordway stopped suddenly , his hands tight and motionless against his sides . In the stillness beyond the terrace it seemed to him that he could hear the deep droning of an engine . The gray mist seemed to be flowing , cold and gentle , into his bones and blood . " I  --  I 'd almost forgotten , " he murmured . Instinctively his eyes went outward , upward . " Did it  --  ? " The girl shook her head . " No , it did not come down . Not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly . " Bix  --  Harry --  " " Those were your friends in the plane ? " He nodded . " They will be all right . If they come down in Switzerland they will be all right . " " Yes , " he said . " They 'll be all right . " For a long moment he was silent , staring out again into the mist . Then with a sudden gesture he reached out and took her hands again . " Carla , " he said , " today  --  here , now , this very minute  --  is the first time in two years that the war has been far away . Do n't let 's talk about it . Not quite yet . Just let me stand here quietly and look at you . Let 's just talk about  --  " " What , Martin ? " " About Kandermatt . About you . " " But there 's nothing to tell . Truly . There 's  --  " She looked away from him again , seeming almost visibly to withdraw into herself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cold and trembling slightly . " Carla , " he said , " what 's happened ? What is it ? Tell me  --  " There was a sound of footsteps on a gravel path , and two figures approached them across the terrace , through the mist . " Also , " a voice said . " Unser Patient ist schon genesen . " A baldish , wispy little man with bright chipmunk 's eyes and a long pointed nose was shaking Ordway 's hand in both of his . " Herr Ordway , " he murmured , over and over again . " Herr Ordway , yes , Herr Ordway  --  " " Hello , Herr Knubel . " " And you remember Andreas ? Yes ? Of course . " The innkeeper indicated his companion . " Old Andreas Benner . " Ordway stared at the oaken stump of a man who stood before him ; at the massive shoulders , the square , weathered face , the clipped , gingery moustache , the sky-blue eyes . He felt his hand compressing in a long-forgotten granite clasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying . " My old friend Andreas , " Ordway said . Benner 's lips parted in a slow , leathery smile , but he did not speak. 44 " It was you who found me , Andreas , " Ordway said . " And lucky for you it was , " Herr Knubel put in . " There is not another person in the valley could have got you up here from the pasture . " He paused and chuckled . " He came up here first and called me down , but why I still do not know . I held one foot and the parachute while he carried the rest of you . " " Andreas was always lugging somebody around like a pile of cordwood . " The three men laughed . Then suddenly there was a silence . Ordway looked from the two men to the girl , who was standing quietly by , to the stone wall and the gray fog beyond . " I do n't know where to begin , Herr Knubel , " he said at last . " All I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  well , that here I am . " " And here you are welcome . " " Thank you . " Ordway looked around him again , uncertainly . " Only I do n't know what I can  --  " Herr Knubel raised a small , important hand . " You are a guest of the Gasthof zum Blauen Himmel , Herr Ordway . " " But  --  " " You are our guest . Just as you were in the old days . The only differences are that your name will not be on the register and you will not find a bill under your door on Saturday mornings . " " But you 'll get in trouble , wo n't you ? " " Trouble ? How ? " " I 'm a uniformed combatant in a neutral country . " " I see no uniform . " Ordway stared down at his tan sweater and worsted trousers . " But even so , I 'm subject to arrest . The authorities will be after me . " " To my certain knowledge , Herr Ordway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " " No one saw me come down , then ? " " In Kandermatt , at two in the morning ? I am afraid you would have been lying there in the pasture a long time if Andreas had not been lucky enough to have a croupy goat . " " You mean  --  " " That you are safe here . That you can remain with us , unmolested , until you decide what you wish to do . " 45Ordway was silent a moment . " I only woke up a short while ago , " he murmured . " I have n't  --  " he hesitated  --  " I 'm afraid I 'm not thinking quite straight yet . " " There is no hurry . " Herr Knubel coughed discreetly and tugged at his long nose . " Andreas and I have this morning been discussing some of the possibilities . ' We shall go into them when you are rested . " " Possibilities ? " " For your escape , Herr Ordway . " " Oh . " " It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But  --  " Ordway 's glance moved from Herr Knubei to Benner . He noticed for the first time that the guide was wearing a belted forest-green tunic and that there was a metal emblem on the band of his hat . " Andreas is a member of the Mountain Patrol Corps , " Herr Knubel said . " And you think there may be some wav  --  " Ordway began . Benner nodded and spoke for the first time . " It is not out of the question , " he said . " But all that is for later , " IIerr Knubcl put in . " Meanwhile you will rest here and be safe . It will be better , I think , if you do not go down to the village . They are good people there , but they will talk . Here at the Gasthof , " he counted off on his fingers , " there are only myself , Frau Knubcl and Friiulcin Dchn , all of whom you know , and a half-witted kitchen girl , who would not know the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As guests , there are Monsieur and Madame Delambre  --  they are French and very well-to-do ; no trouble there  --  and the Herren Hein and Mohler . " " Swiss ? " " No , they are Germans . They are nothing to concern yourself about , though . They are convalescents of some sort  --  here for the quiet and mountain air  --  and they keep almost always to themselves . " The innkeeper pulled at his nose reflectively . " However , simply to take no chances whatever : for them you shall be Mr. Ordway of the International Red Cross in Geneva . " Ordway nodded . " And the other guests ? " " There are no others . " " You have only  --  ? " " Four , yes . With you , five . " Herr Knubel shook his head sadly . " I am afraid you will not find Kandermatt as you remember it , Herr Ordway . " " I 've found the important things as I remember them . You , Andreas , Carla  --  " He looked around suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminine voice was calling them from a window . " Also , willst du dass Herr Ordway da draussen in diesem Sauwetter verhungert ? " " Come , " said Herr Knubel . The three men went through the French windows into the lounge . " Griiss Gott , Herr Ordway , " the woman said . " Griiss Cott , Frau Knubel . " She had aged too , he thought , but not so much as her husband . Her skin had yellowed and was furrowed with wrinkles , but her features were sharp and mobile , her bright black eyes were brighter and blacker than ever , and her dark , coarse hair , still pulled relentlesslyback into a tight bun , showed scarcely a trace of gray . He held her dry , bony hand in his and smiled down at her . " It is almost like the old clays , " she said . " And now come along . It must be more than a full day that you have not eaten . " She led the way across the lounge , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Along one wall , near the swinging door to the kitchen , three tables were set with faded red-and-white-checked cloths and heavy chipped chinaware . The other tables stretched away down the room in lonely files , their tops bare , the chairs stacked neatly on them with their legs upward . The chartreuse carpet and pewter-laden shelves were gone , but the two ibex heads still stared at each other from their oppositewalls with baleful yellow eyes . The great expanse of plate-glass window that composed the south wall was intact . Instead of Herr Knubel 's prided Panoram , however , it disclosed only a gulf of gray , weaving fog . They sat down at the largest of the set tables , and a shuffling girl with pink cheeks and a goitre brought in lentil soup and pork shanks , cheese and goat 's milk . Ordway had not realized before that he was hungry , but once the food was set before him he fell to it ravenously . The others watched him as he ate . " It is not a meal that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frau Knubel said . Ordway murmured something appreciative , but she shook her head . " No , no . It is not like it used to be . " " What is there anywhere that is like it used to be ? " asked Herr Knubel . " ' Things arc hard here too ? " Ordway asked . " In the big cities , no . There things  --  how do you Americans call it ?  --  boom . With the war , of course . And the diplomats and spies and refugees . In the mountains  --  though  --  " Knubel shook his head sombrely . " No tourists , I suppose . " " Tourists ! Switzerland has almost forgotten what that is  --  a tourist . All the great resorts are shut down  --  empty . St. Moritz , Montreux , Grindelwald , all of them . What do you expect for a tiny hidden-away place like Kandermatt ? " " Not even your own people come ? " " The Swiss ? " Herr Knubel gave a bitter little laugh . " Fine chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to a resort . " There was a short silence . Ordway was gazing across the room at the wide plate-glass window and the mist beyond . " And the mountains ? " he asked . " No one climbs the mountains any more ? " Herr Knubel shook his head . " It 's hard to believe . But then how  --  " Ordway looked from Herr Knubel to Benner . " I am not a guide any more , Herr Martin , " Benner said . " I am a member of the Mountain Patrol Corps . " " Do you climb much with them ? " " Our duties take us up to the glaciers and passes . " " But not to the peaks ? " " No , " said Benner . " It is four years now since I have climbed one of the big peaks . " There was another silence . Ordway finished his meal , and they got up and went back into the empty lounge . " Where 's Friiulcin Dchn ? " he asked . " Somewhere about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  well  --  she is no longer exactly a guest , as in the old days . She helps me with many things . " " Yes , she told me . " " You have already seen her then ? Do you not think she has grown into a lovely woman ? " " Yes . I do . " Ordway hesitated a moment . " How long has she been here , Frau Knubel ? " he asked . " Since she came back it is  --  let me see  --  almost two years . " " Two years she 's been here ? ' Without going away ? " Frau Knubel nodded . Then she looked past his shoulder at the man and woman who had just entered the lounge . They were scarcely a couple that Ordway would have expected to find in a lonely , almost deserted inn , in a mountain valley . The woman was tall , young , full-breasted and beautifully dressed in casual sports clothes . Her face was broad , but not to heaviness , with exquisitely regular features and deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of shining gold braids about her head . She walked into the room with the easy languor of a great tawny cat and nodded to I-Ierr and Frau Knubel with a slow , almost indolent smile . The man was as tall as she , with narrow , slightly hunched shoulders . He had a thin , fine-drawn , aristocratic face , prominent nose and high forehead , and wore shell-rimmed glasses with thick lenses , that made his eyes seem very large and dark . Like the woman 's , his clothes  --  gray slacks , a sports jacket and foulard scarf  --  were in perfect taste and of the finest quality . " Monsieur and Madame Delambre  --  Mr. Ordway , " Herr Knubelsaid . Madame Delambre added a gracious nod to her fixed , pearly smile , and her husband extended his hand . " Welcome to our castle in the clouds , Monsieur Ordway , " he said in almost unaccentedEnglish . " Thank you . " " You are , Herr Knubel tells me , an old guest of the inn . This is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " In a way , yes . " Ordway 's glance went back to the woman . " You are old visitors here , Madame Delambre ? " " My wife , unfortunately , speaks neither English nor German , " Delambre explained . " You speak French perhaps , Monsieur Ord-way ? " " I used to once , fairly well , when I went to school in France . But I 've grown rusty , I 'm afraid . " 48 49 " My wife will be glad to give you a chance to practice . " The two men smiled . " To answer your question , though : no , we have never been here before . In Switzerland , many times . In St. Moritz , Marren , Lausanne , Vevey , the whole list of them . But never here . Kandcrmatt is our wartime discovery  --  our , shall we say , ivory tower above the storm . " " I see , " said Ordway . There was a momentary lapse in the conversation . " I have omitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , " that it was Monsieur here who was kind enough to supply the clothes you are wearing . " " It 's very good of you , Monsieur Delambre . Right at the moment I seem to be the orphan child of Kandermatt , but I promise you I 'll  --  " " A pleasure , sir . " Delambre waved a deprecatory hand . " The trousers , I see , are a little on the brief side . " " Not nearly as brief as what I 'd be wandering around in without them . " The three men laughed . Benner , who had been standing in the background , advanced and cleared his throat . " At five o'clock I must report at Patrol Headquarters , " he said . " I will come back tomorrow at the same time . Perhaps then I will have some in-formation . " Herr Knubel nodded , and the guide turned to go . " Andreas , " Ordway said . " Herr Martin ? " " What are you planning to do ? " " Only to collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're sure you wo n't be getting yourself into trouble ? " " Do not worry , Herr Martin . " A slow smile creased the broad mahogany face . " By this time old Andreas knows how to find his way around a few other things besides mountains . " IIe waved a hand and went out . Frau Knubel departed toward the kitchen , and Madame Delambre murmured " Pardon , messieurs " and went upstairs . For a few moments Ordway , Herr Knubel and Dclambrc could hear her heels tapping on the bare floor of the hallway above . Then the sound faded away . Ordway walked to the French windows and stood with his hands in his pockets looking out at the mist. 50 " It is peaceful in our ivory tower , is it not ? " said the Frenchman . For half an hour Ordway lay with closed eyes in the tepid water of the tub , listening to the gentle , remote gurgling of the ancient pipes . Then he shaved with the razor and soap that Herr Knubel had brought him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The foyer , lounge and dining room were empty . He looked intothe kitchen , but . there was no one there except the pink-checked ; waitress with the goitre . Returning to the foyer he stood for a few moments , undecided , then crossed to the front door , opened it and went out . Fog still filled the air with opaque grayness , obscuringeverything beyond a radius of a few yards . Following the low stone wall , he circled the terrace around the inn , stopping briefly at the side and back doors and in front of the boarded-up frame bungalow that once had been the servants ' sleeping quarters . Presentlyhe came to a break in the wall where a dirt road started down from the terrace , and stopped again for a moment . Then he followed the road down . He walked slowly , his hands in his pockets , his shoulders hunched against the mist . The road twisted and dipped down the slope of a knoll , rounded a weed-grown tennis court , and debouchedinto another slightly wider road . He crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stand of tall timber and then , for perhaps half a mile , between open pastures . Then there were trees again , and , presently , a footpath forking off to the left . Leaving the road , lie followed it into the forest . Now he was walking along a winding gray-green tunnel , and the earth was springy and root-veined beneath his feet . Long-forgotten  --  yet strangely unforgotten  --  shapes swam up at him out of the mist : a weathered brown rock with the vague outline of a turreted castle ; an oak-root that writhed across the path like a thick black snake ; a thin silver birch rising suddenly among the dark evergreensand larches . He stopped , went around to the other side of the birch and stood looking at the carved letters  --  S.R. , C.D. , M.O .  --  that showed faintly on the trunk . Then he walked on again . Ahead of him , behind the forest and the mist , he could hear the deep rumbling of the Aarn . Suddenly , for the second time since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the night before . It was no longer a river that was dinning in his ears , but the engines of a stricken bomber . he felt Wasniewicz 's heavy body slithering across the aluminum floorplates as the plane lurched ; he saw the tiny pulse flickering in Riggs ' white jaw-line and the blood spreadingclown from his mouth across the front of his flying suit like a great crimson napkin . Bixlcr , John R.Wasniewicz , HarryRiggs , Theodore L.With the prescribed notations . And a letter to a girl called Biscuit ... . The forest walls slipped past on either side . Then they thinned and fell away behind him , and he was picking his way slowly through a labyrinth of tumbled boulders . The river seemed suddenly to spring out of the earth to meet him . It came down over a steep , rocky pitch to his right in a wild cascade of foam and plunged into a deep basin below . Here , for a brief instant , it became a still , green pool ; then it moved forward again , at first very slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucked onward by some immense hidden pump , until it was a smooth , racing torrent . Then it struck the rocks again , split into a hundred gleaming ribbons , circled and crisscrossed in a fifty-yard frenzy of white water , and finally drew together again and plunged out of sight among the trees below . Along its entire visible length rose a great fringe of spray , merging into the gray , windless mist above . Its sound , as Ordway approached it from the bordering forest , swelled quietly from a rumble to a pervading roar . IIe followed the path upstream among the boulders , climbed a steep wooded spur and crossed the river on a high cable-strung footbridge . On the far side was another spur , climbing still higher , and as he ascended the path along its edge the Aarn slowly dropped away beneath him into a deep gorge of spray and shadow . Presently the trees were beneath him too , and he came out on an open , scrubby slope surmounted by a bald knob of rock . He clambered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to the again-remote r unbling of the river and watching the mist drift in slow gray billows across the treetops below . Dear Biscuit .  --  No . Dear Frances . . . Dear Mrs. Riggs , Was-52niewicz , Bixler . . . Dear Mrs. Smith , Madame Duval , Frau Schulz , Comrade Ivanova . . . I am so sorry , madam , believe me . So regretfully , respectfully sorry . So officially , quintuplicately , **35;962;TOOLONG ... . He closed his eyes and held his hands to his face , pressing the lids gently with his fingers . There was the report to be written . ( Reports on all missions will be written out as soon as possible , so that details will not be forgotten . ) That was if you got back . It was a strange thing that he had not once thought about getting back , until Andreas and Herr Knubel had hinted at it on the terrace . And he had not thought about it since . . . . Well , Andreas would be returning the next afternoon with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing he could do . Ordway , Martin F. , Capt. , Plt. , 31 , Larchmont , N.Y. , was a line in a book at S-i , with a tentative MIA pencilledopposite . The Martin Ordway who really existed was a tired , solitary man in sweater , sport shirt and too-short worsted trousers sitting with his hands over his eyes on a knob of rock in a forest in the remote Alpine valley of Kandermatt . Kandermatt .. . He folded his arms across his knees and looked out over the treetopsinto fog-filled space . . . . That was another thing he had not thought about . Flow had he come to Kandermatt ? How , flying blind and crippled in the night over Europe , over the fields and forests , lakes and rivers , ruined cities and ravaged countryside of half a continent , had he come to the Alps , to that region of the Alps , to that very range , river , village , dropping slowly , gently out of darkness and roaring death into the still , lost valley of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Chance only . The chance of ten thousand vagrant air currents ; of a hundred thousand off-beat whirrings of a faulty propeller ; of the dip of a punctured wing , the angle of a warped aileron , the light touch of a finger on a stick , The chance that , instant by instant throughout the universe , in the spinning of a coin , a sperm cell , a stellar nebula , simultaneouslycreates its unimaginable millions of alternatives and blindly and irrevocably ordains one . Yes , it was chance . It was only chance . He knew that . And yet .. . For several minutes he sat motionless , his eyes on the gray rock53around him . Then he looked at his watch . It was almost seven ; it would be getting dark soon . But it was not getting darker . Look- ing around him with sudden awareness , he had the curious im- pression that , on the contrary , it was growing lighter . The rock under his hand seemed to have taken on a pale gleam , and the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outline , like images in a twisted lens shifting slowly into focus . He watched silently and waited . The mist was lifting . Dense billows rose languidly from the forest , like the smoke of a thousand fires . For a few moments they hung motionless above the treetops , then broke into long streaming tatters and dissolved . Depth after depth , the gray veil thinned , and the earth beneath it emerged slowly , as if from beneath a vast withdrawing sea . Presently the whole forest was revealed ; then fragments and patches of green fields beyond ; finally the whole sweep of the fields , the road , the river , the white roof of the inn , the church steeple of the distant village . There was no wind . The mist did not blow away . It merely seeped upward , impelled by some invisible , silent chemistry of the air , and in its place was the valley of Kan- dermatt , spread peacefully in the evening light . Now the mist was no longer mist at all , but a vast sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receding . Moment by mo- ment , mile by mile , the valley walls emerged : the tilted pastures , the dark tiers of forest , the desolate scree-slopes , the silver threads of streams . For an instant the clouds seemed to hang mo- tionless against their upper reaches in an opaque , motionless ceil- ing . Then there was a sudden white glint behind them . The glint brightened , expanded , boring and burning its way through , and the cloud-mass slowly dissipated into fragments , like a great crum- bling wall . Glaciers and snowfields came into view , gorges and precipices , ridges and peaks , tiering one beyond the other , one above the other , into immeasurable depths of space . Where a few moments before there had been nothing , a new world had sprung into being  --  a silent , soaring , gleaming world , transfixed like a huge white wave against the sky . Ordway 's gaze travelled slowly along the jagged are of the hori- zon . The mighty , unforgotten shapes rose up for him again out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouldered 54 slopes of the Rotalp , across the precipices of the Karlsberg , the icefields of the Wunderhorn , the high tessellated rampart between the Graf and the Grafin . They followed the twisting rock-spine of the Dornelberg to its wedge-like summit , descended to the deep blue shadow of its gorges , climbed again over glacier and buttress and up the mile-high granite faces of the Himmelshorn . Then presently he was no longer staring at the mountains but at the sky above them  --  at a single white cloud that still hung suspended in space beyond the ridges and domes and pinnacles of the range . The sun had already set behind the summits of the Burggen Peaks , to the northwest , and valley , foothills and the range itself lay spread in a deep sea of twilight . But the cloud , high above them , was still shining in the rays of day that streamed up from below the horizon . As he watched , its whiteness turned gradually to pink , and from pink to flaming fire . Then the glow faded , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , radiant white shape unmoving and immutable in the sky . And in that instant he knew it was no cloud . For a long while he remained staring upward through the fadinglight . From where he sat the vast base and trunk of the White Tower were hidden by the intervening masses of the Dornelberg and the Himmelshorn ; all that was visible above them were the great curving domes of the precipice-tops and , resting lightly upon them , the snowy crown of the summit dome . The sky behind it had faded now to a deep gun-metal gray . Above its eastern ridge a single star had appeared , brightening slowly . The dome was not jagged or tapering , like the crests of the nearer , lesser mountains that ringed it . Immeasurably larger than all the others , it was still not sheer mass that set it apart ; immeasurablyhigher , it was still not mere height . Alone and unchallenged , it needed no ultimate thrust of turret or spire to assert its supremacy . Innocent of struggle , or aspiration , of conquest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its appointed place in the sky  --  and stopped . It was a fact . It existed . . . . It was there . Martin Ordway sat for another few minutes watching the stars come out and the blue shadows flow in a slow wave up the mountainsides . Then he looked at his watch again , arose , and walked slowly back through the dark forest to the inn. 55Chapter 4N icholas Radcliffe 's chalet had not changed . You swung around a wide bend in the path , passed through the lopsided , never-closed gate , and there it was , rust-colored and prim , clinging to its hillside . Ordway crossed the minute terraced garden , climbed the verandahsteps and tapped with the wooden knocker . Presently the door was opened by a square-faced , square-bodied woman with white hair and placid brown eyes . " Hello , Mrs. Meach , " he said . The woman looked at him blankly . Then she took a half-step forward and squinted her eyes against the bright morning sun . Then she took a half-step back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " Ordway smiled . " Mr. Martin  --  " She raised her hands , as if to put them on his shoulders , dropped them and burst into tears . " It 's not that bad , is it ? " he asked . " It 's that good , Mr. Martin  --  " She was crying , holding his hand and trying to dry her eyes on her apron , all at the same time . " But the Doctor he 'll be killing me , " she exclaimed suddenly , " standinghere gabbing with you like this . " She turned quickly to go inside , but at the same moment Radcliffeappeared in the door . Ilc was even taller and thinner than Ordway remembered him : a sunbrowned cadaver of a man withc6  --  yes , he thought , Carla had had it right  --  the face of a vegetarian vulture . The bald dome of his head was a little balder than before , the fringe of sandy-gray hair a little grayer and shaggier ; but the bold line of the predatory nose was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the full sunlight , were still a keen , metallicblue . " Well ? " he asked , looking from Mrs. Meach to Ordway .. And then suddenly , " Well ! Well ! " Ordway grinned as they shook hands . " That will cost me exactlyfifty francs , " he said . " Fifty francs ? What will ? " " I made a small bet with myself on the way up that the first words you 'd say would be : " Mrs. Meach , bring our guest a cup of tea . ' " " Wrong . But they 're the second words . " Radcliffe waved his housekeeper toward the kitchen . " And the Huntley and Palmers , Mrs. Meach , " he added . " This is a very special tea . " He led Ordway through a dark hallway and into a large , disorderedroom that was half library and half laboratory . Books lined three of the walls from floor to ceiling and overflowed in assorted stacks on the floor . The desk , table and several chairs were piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific journals . Along the fourth wall , in front of the windows , was an unpainted workbench littered with more books , more pamphlets , bottles , test tubes , chemical apparatus , two Bunsen burners and a conglomeration of stones and rock fragments of all shapes , sizes and colors . Radcliffe swept a pile of Geological Reviewsfrom an armchair and made his guest sit down . Then he walked to the workbench , leaned back against it and peered at him silently . " Well ! " he said again , " now let 's have it . " " I got here night before last , " Ordway said . " How ? " Ordway told him . The Englishman listened quietly , his long arms folded across his chest , his head cocked forward and a little to one side . " I shall leave it to that undisputed mistress of the cliche , Mrs. Meach , to observe that it 's a small world , " he said , when Ordway had finished . " Apparently , however , it is . " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housekeeper came in with the tea and crackers. 57 " Two lumps , no milk . Right ? " said Radcliffe . " Right . " Ordway looked admiringly at the bowl of cut sugar . " Iloardings , " Radcliffe explained . " It 's a small world , " 1VIrs . Meach said , shaking her head in wonder . She retired to the kitchen again , and the two men sat sipping their tea . " A bomber pilot , " the Englishman said meditatively . " Tell me about it . " " There 's not much to tell . You fly . You drop bombs . If you 're lucky you fly back . " " I remember you always wanted to be a flyer . Years ago . " Ordway nodded . " But there was something else , too , " Radcliffe narrowed his eyes and rubbed his hand slowly along the sharp ridge of his jaw . " Let me see . . . . An architect , that 's it ! You were studying at the Beaux Arts in Paris and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . In a way . " " In a way ? " " Architects were n't eating very well in New York in the middle thirties . Meanwhile I 'd learned to fly on the side , as a sort of hobby , and when the war came that was that . " A thin smile touched Ordway 's lips . " I 'm afraid I was a bit of a flop at building houses , but they seem satisfied with the way I knock them down . " Radcliffe was silent a moment . " And now what ? " he asked presently . " If the authorities catch up with me , they 'll intern me , of course . They have n't yet . Andreas and Herr Knubel have some idea about  --  " " Smuggling you out ? " " I think so . I do n't know anything about it yet , though . " " You want to get back , naturally ? " " Yes . That is  --  " Ordway passed a hand over his eyes . Then he got suddenly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood looking out across the valley at the frozen stillness of the peaks . " I do n't know , " he said . Radcliffe watched him a few moments without speaking , " Just a few miles beyond those mountains , " he said , " there are armies5gmarching , cities burning , a whole world clutching at its own throat . It seems incredible from here , does n't it ? " Ordway nodded . " Sometimes weeks go by , " the Englishman went on , " when I almost forget there is such a thing as a war . I sit cooped here in my study , writing and fiddling with my rocks ; or I tramp over the scree-slopes and glaciers , collecting my specimens . When every so often the newspapers come up from Berne or Zurich I sit down and look at them and it 's like reading Wells or Jules Verne . " Ordway turned back from the window . " You have n't been out then ? " he asked . " Out ? " " Home . " " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you know how long I 've lived here in Kandermatt ? Seventeen years . In all that time I 've been back to England exactly twice . The first time was in 1929 , when my mother died . The second was for two weeks in 1936 , to buy some books and give a Iecture at Brasenose . I 'm still an Englishman  --  yes  --  of course I am . But what use would I be in England now ? Another mouth to feed . Another ration book to issue . Another superannuated fuddy-duddy with an ARP button and a bucket running around throwing sand in the wrong places and telling anybody who 'll listen what it was like at Passchendaele and Vimy Ridge . " No , Ordway  --  there was a very wise old bird who once said that every man should cultivate his own garden . That is what I 've tried to do with my life : cultivate my little garden of rocks . I suppose that by now I know more about the rock structure and glaciation of the central Alps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , work out my theories , write my books . And I like to think that by doing so I 'm better fulfilling my function  --  better serving mankind , if you will  --  than by fatuously trying to turn myself into something I am not and chasing off in all directions like Leacock 's horseman . " Radcliffe refilled Ordway 's teacup and paced slowly about the cluttered room with his hands thrust deep into his pockets . " Well , now you know the reason I 'm still here , " he said at last . " It sounds like a good one , " Ordway said . " Yes , does n't it ? " The Englishman smiled a little at the corners59of his mouth ; then he stopped near his workbench and stood stroking his chin . " It would be so satisfactory if it were the real one . " Ordway stared . " The real one ? " he repeated . " Oh , it is partly , I suppose . " Radcliffe 's voice had become low and almost toneless . " Or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came Dunkerque , and France went under , and suddenly I knew I had to go back . I had n't felt that way about anything in years . Not since  --  well  --  Everest . It did n't matter what the difficulties were . Nothing mattered . I had to go  --  that was all there was to it . " He paused and let out a long , slow breath . " Well , I started off . One day in July , I threw a few things into an overnight bag , went into Interlaken and took the train to Geneva . Geneva was a madhousethat summer  --  you can imagine . I went to the British ministerand consul , but they were helpless . I went to the Swiss foreignoffice , and they could do nothing . Then after several days , through some friends at the university , I was put in touch with a group of refugee Frenchmen . They were already forming the rudiments of an underground , and after a lot of palaver they said they thought they could get me through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before came to my hotel room and handed me an Alsatian peasant 's outfit and a revolver . I was to stand in front of a certain number on the Rue du Rhone at six the next morning and a furniture van would pick me up . As we neared the French border I was to crawl into a hidden compartment between the cab and the body of the van , which the driver would show me . When  --  or perhaps it was if  --  we got to Lyons , I was to leave the truck and look up a certain produce dealer in the Place de L'Hopital , who would give me further instructions . " The man left , and I sat there in that hotel room all night . I looked at that bundle of peasant 's clothes . I looked at the revolver . I began thinking of all my books standing on the shelves back here , and of Mrs. Meach and the sound of the Aarn and the monographI was writing on the foliation of strata . And suddenly I knew the jig was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was all . No more than I had had it up there on the northeast ridge of Everest sixteen years before . I was still no adventuring hero , but just a timid middle-aged duffer with a head full of Pleistocene fossil depositsand a temperamental digestion . . . . Well , old boy , I told6omyself  --  here you are again . It 's retreat in good order again ... . Before it got light I went out and threw the clothes and revolver in the lake . Then I went to the station and waited for the first train to leave for Interlaken . " Radcliffe had half-turned and stood looking absorbedly at the litter on his workbench . Ordway finished his tea and put down the cup and saucer . " The first reason 's better , " he said . " Better , perhaps . But truer ? " " Yes , truer too . You 're being a fool if you 're still blaming your-self . " The Englishman turned back to him and seemed about to speak ; then he stopped himself and shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said suddenly in a different voice . " It always stinks of my damned acetates in here . Let 's go out to the verandah . " They sat on the rough-hewn verandah steps , and he set about the elaborate business of filling and lighting a pipe . Ordway sat with his chin in his hands , his eyes moving slowly across the panoramathat spread before them . Radcliffe 's house was situated on the eastern slope of the valley , at the point where the upper reaches of open pasture met the lower fringes of forest , and directly in front of it the earth tilted away in a thousand-foot incline of shimmering grass . At the foot of the slope spread the valley floor , its jigsaw fields bright in the sunlight , the road and the river , the village and the white inn tiny but jewel-clear beneath the cloudless gulfs of air . Above it , the west wall of the valley climbed steeply in pasture , forest and scree-slope to the cold tumbledwilderness of the peaks . The ridges and summits rose , one behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From their center , springing up from its satellites like a mountain resting on mountaintops , the Weissturm struck with blazing fire into the sky . Ordway sat silentlysquinting at it through the blue miles . " It does n't change , " Radcliffe said . " No . " " From day to day it 's different . From hour to hour ; even minuteto minute . Day and night come ; sun and rain and snow and fog and wind come ; and with each of them it 's different . It 's clif-61ierent , and yet it does n't change . The years and the centuries come , and it does n't change . " Ile fell silent again , drawing slowly on his pipe . " Do you go up often ? " Ordway asked , To the glaciers ? Every few weeks . " " To the Tower , I mean ? " " Only as far as the hut . " " You 've still never tried  --  ? " " Climbing it ? " The Englishman shook his head . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's  --  well  --  younger . " Ile paused , blowing out a thin cloud of smoke , and chuckled softly . " Remember how you and Miss Dehn and that blond Viennese boy used to walk up here in the late afternoons , and old Meach would fill you full of tea and those horrifying scones of hers ? And then you 'd sit out here on the steps and look at the Tower through the binoculars , and each time one of you was sure he 'd figured out a route ? " " Yes , " Ordway said . " I remember . " For another few moments he continued gazing at the mountain . Then he turned and looked at Radcliffe . " Do you see her often ? " he asked . " Who ? " " Carla . " " Oh , occasionally in the village , or when I stop by at the inn . " " She works there now ? " " So I understand . " " Ilas she  --  talked to you ? " " Talked ? Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean about why she 's here . Why she came back . " " No , she has n't said anything about that . " Radcliffe shook his head slowly and pulled at his pipe . Then he shrugged . " After all , old boy , there 's no accounting for where much of anyone is these days . You  --  myself : why are we where we are ? Or half the people in the world ? . . . I came back . Miss Dehn came back . Now you 're back . Sufficient unto the day . . . ' " He sat for a few moments gently stroking his jaw . Then he slapped Ordway vigorously on the knee and got to his feet . " And now , my boy , steel yourself . You are about to hear Debussy 's Mandoline played on a flute as , I give you my personal guarantee , it has never been played before . " 62 Ordway walked slowly down the winding path through the bright patterns of shade and sunlight . He traversed a steep slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crossed a quick little stream on a chain of worn stepping stones . Emerging into pasture again , he continued for a short distance , then stopped and sat down on a bank of grass beside the path . A flock of sheep , a small boy and a shaggy dog were moving about on the slope , far below . He watched them for a few minutes and then lay back on the soft turf . Closing his eyes , he listened to the chirping of the pipits in the near-by trees and felt the autumn sunshine pouring , warm and gentle , through his body . Perhaps ten minutes had passed when he heard the sound of footsteps . He sat up , rubbed the drowse from his eyes and saw that two young men were approaching , one behind the other , up the narrow path . They were dressed in white sport shirts and khaki shorts and wore heavy , nailed climbing boots . The one in the lead carried a coil of rope over his shoulder , and the second a light rucksack . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then stopped and looked down at him . " Griiss Gott , " said the first one . " Griiss Gott , " Ordway said . He looked from one to the other . The one who had spoken was a man of about his own age , of medium height and compact frame , with smooth dark-brown hair , gray eyes and handsome , almost Grecian , features . The other was short , yellow-haired , and appeared slightly younger . Both had clear , light skin , and their bare legs and forearms were hairless and strongly muscled . " Es ist ziemlich warm heute , nicht wahr ? " the second one said . " Ja , sehr warm , " Ordway answered . " Sie sprechen Deutsch , also ? " said the taller one . " Nur ein  --  " Ordway searched for the word  --  " ein wenig . " " So ? Was sprechen Sie denn besser ? Franzosisch ? Englisch ? " Ordway hesitated an instant . " Englisch , " he said . " Good , " the young man said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echter Englander , to be sure  --  but enough . " He studied Ordwaybriefly with cool gray eyes . " You are the new guest at the Gasthof , I imagine ? " " Yes . " " We are at the Gasthof too . My name is Hein and my friend 63here is Herr Mohler . Perhaps Herr Knubel has mentioned our names to you . " " Yes , he has . " The two men stood looking at him , waiting . " My name is Ordway , " he said after a moment . " Martin Ordway . " IIcin repeated the name and bowed slightly . " Es freut mich sclir , " said his companion . " Herr Mohler , unfortunately , does not speak English , " Hein explained . He removed the rope from his shoulder , threw it ou the grass and sat down beside it . " You do not mind if we rest here with you a moment ? It is warm climbing today . " " Of course not , " said Ordway . The one called Mohler sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy felt-covered canteen . Unscrewing the cap , he offered it to Ordway . " Thank you , no , " Ordway said . " Es ist frisch . " " I 'm not thirsty , thanks . " Mohler drank , passed the canteen to Hein and then put it back in the rucksack . There was a few moments ' silence , and Ordway looked at the yellow rope lying coiled in the grass . " You 're going up for some climbing ? " he asked . " Just for a bit of exercise , " said Ilcin . " On the rocks above the Blausee . . . . You know the Blauscc , Herr Ordway ? " " Oh , yes . " " You have been in Kandcrm att before , then ? " " Many years ago . " " It is a beautiful place , is it not ? The valley and the mountains . Others may talk all they want about Mont Blanc and the Matterhornand the rest . But for those who know mountains there is just one peak in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that is the Weissturm . " " You know the Alps well , then ? " " Oh yes . Herr Molder here and I have climbed in almost every district from Chamonix to the Dolomites . In past years , of course . More recently  --  well  --  one has been busy elsewhere , has one not ? " Ordway nodded , and there was another pause . " You have clone much climbing yourself ? " Hein asked . " Some . Also before the war . " " You are planning to do any while you are here ? " 64 " I do n't know . Perhaps . I have n't thought about it . " " You will be in Kandermatt for a while , I suppose ? " " No , not long . " " Ah , that is too bad . " Hein smiled slightly , his gray eyes steady on Ordway 's face . " Holidays are always too short , are they not ? ... Well , in any case , perhaps we could arrange a day 's climbing before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ordway glanced at his watch , and simultaneously Hein picked up his rope and got to his feet . " Also , Hans , " he said , " lass uns weitergehen . " He swung the rope onto his shoulders , and Mohler adjusted his rucksack . " Heil  --  " Hein broke off . The gray eyes seemed to be smiling again . " Auf wiedersehen , Herr Ordway , " he said . " Auf wiedersehen , " said Ordway . He sat watching them plodding up the path until they disappeared into the timber . Then he got up and slowly continued his descent through the quiet pastures . It was late afternoon when he reached the inn . The terrace was deserted , as usual , and there was no one in the foyer . Going through the dining room , he opened the kitchen door and looked in , but the only person there was Annamarie , the waitress . " Haben Sie Fraulein Dehn gesehen ? " he asked . She shook her head . " Wissen Sie wo sie ist ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a giggle Ordway closed the door , returned to the foyer and stood for a moment , undecided , at the foot of the stairs . Then he went into the lounge . The Frenchman , Delambre , was seated in an armchair near tht windows , reading a book . " Oh , hello , " Ordway said . " Good afternoon . " Delambre nodded pleasantly . Ordway crossed to the table against the far wall and stood thumbing the pages of a six-months ' old Illustrierte Zeitung . " Glorious weather today , " the Frenchman said. 65 " Perfect . " " You have been for a bit of a walk , perhaps ? " " Yes . " " You have had a good view of the mountains , then ? " Ordway nodded . " Formidable , eh ? " " Oh yes . " There was a short silence . Then Delambre closed his book and smiled . " Having succinctly disposed of the climate and terrain , " he said , " may I suggest that we have a drink together , Monsieur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing I 'd like better . But there 's no longer a bar , is there ? " " No , but fortunately I am in a position to offset Herr Knubel 's error of omission . I can offer  --  let me see now  --  cinzano , anise , cognac Courvoisier four-star , I-Iolland gin and a fair-to-middling Merseault ' 28 . " Ordway smiled . " The cognac sounds fine . That is , if you  --  " " It is my choice too . " The Frenchman got to his feet . " If you will excuse me a moment , I shall bring it down . " Iie bowed slightly and went out . Ordway paced slowly about the lounge until he returned carrying a bottle and two brandy inhalers . " I think you may find this rather pleasant , " Dclambre said . He set the glasses down , filled them and handed one to Ordway . " Alois  --  aux survivants --  " Ordway looked at him questioningly . " To  --  the survivors . " They drank , and Ordway felt the liquid spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his body . When he had finished he held the inhaler up and looked at the crest and initial D that were delicately etched on the crystal curve of its side . " You 've managed well , for a place like Kandermatt , " he said . Delambre shrugged his thin shoulders . " One does what one can . Fortunately I was able to salvage a little when the barbarian came . " He paused , refilling the glasses . " You are interested in the arts and literature , Monsieur Ordway ? " " I was once . " " Perhaps then you would be interested sometimes in seeing66some of the things in my room . There is a Van Gogh  --  his early period  --  a Toulouse-Lautrec , a few of the moderns , several orientaland Majorcan ceramic pieces , and some rather choice books . " " You really did manage , did n't you ? " " It was not easy , I assure you . No transport , no facilities , no anything . And the Boche everywhere , hunting for loot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Frenchman can , and in the end succeeded in getting a handful of possessions out with me . " Delambre sighed gently and sipped at his brandy . " It is a desolate world in which we live , Monsieur . I am afraid life would have long since become intolerable for me if I could not at least be surrounded by a few civilized and lovely things . " " Madame Delambre  --  I hope you wo n't mind my saying so  --  is very lovely too . " " My wife  --  yes . She is a beautiful woman , " Delambre took off his shell-rimmed glasses and swung them slowly in his fingers . " She is not French , you know . " " I 'd thought perhaps  --  " " She is half Dutch and half Swedish . Her name is Astrid . " Delambre seemed about to continue and then paused . He took a handkerchief from his sleeve , wiped his glasses carefully and put them back on . " Yes , " he said , " she is very lovely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ordwayglanced at the book that lay on the table beside his chair . " L'Immoraliste , " the Frenchman said . " Do you know Gide ? " " I once read The Counterfeiters . Years ago . " " And did you like him ? " " No , not a great deal , as I remember . His point of view seemed to me  --  well  --  decadent . " " Decadent ? " Dclambre pursed his lips and pulled at them gently with his long fingers . " PerhalSs . But is not that perhaps the most intrinsic quality of the world we live in  --  decadence ? " " Speaking generally , I would n't know . The most intrinsic qualityof the world I 've been living in the past few years is death . " " Ah , but exactly . Death  --  decadence . Decadence  --  death . The one is the becoming , the other the accomplished fact . Whether it is of the body or the spirit is immaterial ; it is all one ; and it is the enzyme and zygote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would wish it otherwise . " Delambre tapped the book67beside him . " That is why Gide is great , monsieur . He sees , he knows , and he is not afraid to tell . More than any other writer  --  alone with a few men like Modigliani in painting and perhaps Schonberg in music  --  he truly understands the sickness of our times ; this tragic and ever-widening gulf between the world of the mind and the world of fact , between our thinking and feeling and our doing . His very homosexuality is  --  again to use the word  --  intrinsic . It is modern man , impotent to cope with the confusions and monstrosities he has created , turning inward on himself ; selfdevouring , self-consuming . . . " Delambre paused and sipped his brandy . " You are a bomber pilot , Monsieur Ordway ? " " Yes . " " But you have not always been a bomber pilot ? " " Of course not . " " No . There was a time when you were something else . An engineer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it does not matter . You were young , hopeful , ambitious , your energies directed toward the things of the spirit and the mind . Then the war came  --  another war  --  the endless war . The world said to you suddenly , No , you are none of these things you imagine yourself to be . You are a bomber pilot . ' And it made you a bomber pilot . I asked you before if you were interested in literature and the arts , and you answered that once you were . That implies that you are no longer ; or , rather , that the world no longer permits you to be . It has taken you and changed you from a thinker into a doer , from a force into an agent ; it has made you into a tiny cog in its monstrous machinery . Oh , a very remarkable cog , I grant you  --  a very precise , ingenious , effective bit of mechanism . But a cog none the less . And in the process what has happened ? What has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that you are probably no longer a thinking , feeling man in the sense you once were . Your mind , perceptions and sensibilities have grown decadent and in danger of atrophy . " Delambre drained his glass and reached for the bottle . " Monsieur ? " he asked . Ordway shook his head . " I 'm still working on this , thanks . " The Frenchman poured the brandy into his own glass , inhaled 68its bouquet and sipped . " At the other extreme , " he went on , " take the case of one like myself , who is a writer . " " I did n't know  --  " Ordway began . " Oh yes , I am a writer . " Delambre smiled deprecatingly . " I shall not hold it against you , however , that you are not acquainted with my name . Most of my work is of a  --  well  --  somewhat special critical and philosophic nature and is , thus far , known only to a rather intimate circle . . . . As I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration of which we were speaking manifestsitself in an opposite , and yet parallel , way in men who are not doers in the outward sense but are attempting to live the sentient , contemplative life . A man like Gide , for example . Or Modigliani or Schonberg or any true artist . The machine rejects them , and they reject it . They strive to rise above it , to ignore it , fight it , change it  --  what you will ; but they can not . They are in it and yet not part of it , and it crushes them to death . They can still think and feel  --  yes ; but they can no longer do . They still write their books and paint their pictures and compose their symphonies ; but the vitality , the bone and blood , the integration with life is gone . They too , like the doers , the machine-men and war-men , have become sterile and atrophied . " Delambre smiled gently . " Forgive me , Monsieur  --  I am talking too much , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you should read a bit more of Gide  --  you really should . You will find he will tell you as much about the nature of things as aerial photographs , tachometers and high frequency radio receivers . " He arose , holding his brandy glass , walked to the window and stood silently looking out . " There is a world at war , " he said suddenly , " and there is also a world of peace . There is the miracle of a six-ton bomb and there is the miracle of a snowflake . There is the field of rotting corpses and there is the White Tower . Ah yes , there is still enough of the good , the true , the beautiful left in the world , Monsieur Ordway , if one has but the wit to find them . Come , I propose another toast . " He raised his glass and smiled again . " To all good and true and beautiful things . To warm , glowing cognac in crystal inhalers ; to Monsieur Gide and Monsieur Van Gogh ; to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger ; to lovely women and the cold , beautiful mountains  --  and atrophy. . . . " 69Andreas Benner was sitting on the terrace wall as Ordway came down the verandah steps . His booted feet were planted firmly on the ground and his gnarled hands rested on his knees . He looked as if he had not so much as moved a muscle since he had been there . " I-Iow long have you been waiting ? " Ordway asked as he crossed to him . The guide got up and shook hands with a quick , formal jerk . " Only a little while , Herr Ordway . " " The name 's Martin . " " Only a little while , Herr Martin . " " You should have let me know you were here . " " There was no hurry . " Ordway laughed . " Still the same old Andreas , eh ? Komm ich heute nicht , komm ich morgen ja . ' " The corners of Benner 's eyes crinkled into the hundred tiny lines that meant he was smiling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I still remember you , you mean . " Ordway took a pack of cigarettesfrom his pocket and held them out . " Anicrikanische , " he said . " You used to like them . " " Jawohl . " Benner took one and held it tightly between thumb and forefinger while Ordway gave him a light . IIe smoked silently for a few moments , exhaling the smoke from his mouth in long blue jets and shredding the cigarette-end between his teeth . " I have made already a few inquiries , " lie said . " Yes ? " " There is not , of course , much that can be done in a small villagelike Kandermatt . But I have got a little information , and it seems there are possibilities . " " What happens now ? " " There is a certain man I should see down in Interlaken . I shall go there tomorrow . " " But  --  " " That part is easy . I go to Interlaken every few weeks anyhow , for other things . What this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know . Perhaps lie will say it is impossible . Perhaps there will be a long delay . " There was a moment 's silence , and Ordway put his hand on70the guide 's arm . " Look , Andreas , " he said . " This is wonderful of you , and I appreciate it more than I can tell you . But I wo n't have you getting yourself into trouble , understand ? " " I shall not get into trouble , Herr Martin . " " After all , it 's not a matter of life and death for me . Switzerland is neutral . Hundreds of American and British flyers have come down here over the past two years , and all that happens to them is that they 're interned . " Benner nodded . " Yes , there have been many . " " And how many of them get out ? " " A few . " " Have you been  --  ? " " Helping to get them out ? No . " " But then why  --  ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . " They were silent again , smoking . " They have found your plane , " Benner said suddenly . Ordway swung around . " When ? Where ? " " Late yesterday , I think it was . Over on a mountainside above Lauterbrunnen . They found two bodies in it . " " Only two ? " " There were more ? " " There were four of us . Three after I jumped . " Ordway paused briefly . " They were dead then , of course . " " It is not necessary that you tell me that , Herr Martin . " " One of them must have been thrown clear somehow . " Benner nodded . " There are many ways a man can disappear ona mountain . Into a crevasse ; down a slope  --  " " Yes , of course . " Ordway turned away , looking at the road and the timber and the bright meadows below . Dear Mrs. BixIer . Dear Mrs. Wasniewicz . Dear Biscuit .. . His eyes moved over the valley floor , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of rock above . " You can almost see the Heilweg Hut , Andreas , " he said presently . " Yes . It is there  --  see  --  by that outcropping of red rock , straight down from the Karlsberg . " The guide pointed . " But I ca n't see the lake . " " No , the lake is down behind . " 71Benner dropped his remaining half-inch of cigarette to the grass and stepped on it carefully with a heavy boot . " Have you been to the hut lately ? " Ordway asked . " I was there last about three weeks ago , with the Patrol . " " It 's gone to pot , I suppose ? " " Bitte ? " " Is it run down ? " " Yes , it is run down . The Alpenverein closed it officially almost three years ago . " " And no one goes there except the Patrol ? " " Herr Radcliffe uses it sometimes when he is collecting his stones . The French gentleman , I think , has been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans while I was walking this afternoon , " Ordway said . " They seem to be climbers . " " Yes , they have made some ascents . " " Have you gone with them at all ? " Benner shook his head . " Even in the good times the Germans do not often use guides . They think they are better than the guides . " " These two seemed to know their way around . " " Bitte ? " " They sounded like  --  well  --  experts . " " Yes , I have heard that they are . The one called Hein  --  the older one  --  before the war he is supposed to have made some terribleclimbs . " " Terrible ? " " The Matterhorn faces ; the Eigcrwand ; that sort of thing , like so many of the young Germans were doing . " Benner shook his head again . " That I have never understood . We Swiss  --  yes , and the English and French and Americans too  --  we climb mountains for sport . But the Germans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know . Only it is not for sport . " The two men were silent again . The sun had begun to slope away toward the west , and the first pink tinge of evening touched the snow-peaks high above . " And Carla ? " Ordway asked suddenly . The guide looked at him questioningly . " Fraulein Dehn . Does she go up to the mountains sometimes ? " 72 " No , I do not think so . " " You see her often ? " " Not often . Sometimes when I am here at the inn . She works now for Frau Knubel . " " Have you any idea why she 's working here ? " " Why ? " " Or why she 's in Kandermatt ? " " A person must live some place . Kandermatt is better than most , I suppose . " Benner paused and shook his head . " No , she came back  --  let me see  --  it is two years ago now and has been here ever since . That is all I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is your supper , Herr Martin , " he said . " And I must report at Patrol Head-quarters . " " When will I see you again , Andreas ? " " Tomorrow I go down to Interlaken , and it will be late before I am back . I will stop by the following morning and let you know how things are going . " " Good . " Ordway hesitated . " Only  --  " " fa ? " " Only , remember what I said before . Do n't get yourself in trouble . It 's not that  --  well  --  important . " The guide looked at him curiously . " You want to go  --  do you not , Herr Martin ? " It was a moment before Ordway answered . " Yes , " he said . " Yes , of course . " " Then do not worry , and we shall see what can be done . " They shook hands , and Ordway watched the stumpy , broadshoulderedfigure swing through the gate and down the dirt road into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his room to wash . He did not wash immediately , however . Instead , he sat down on the edge of the bed and sat studying the interwoven squares and lozenges of the faded green carpet . In his mind he went back , one by one , over the meetings and conversations of the day : Radcliffe ; the two Germans on the pastureslope ; Delambre ; Benner . He recalled the afternoon before : awakening in the strange , familiar room in which he now sat ; the girl sitting alone on the terrace wall ; the bald knob of rock above73the Aarn , and the valley and mountains emerging from the mist . Beyond that his mind would not go . He closed his eyes and struggled to face his thoughts back to the hours and days before , but they would not go . Everything before the moment of his awakeningwas blurred and remote to him , as if shrouded in fog and night . What was it then that had been happening to him in those past thirty hours ? What had happened that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , and not cared whether Benner came back from Interlaken with his " information " next day or next month ? Why  --  to face right up to it  --  did n't he seem to care if he ever got out ; if he ever got anywhere ? . . . Was it fear , perhaps ? Fear of himself and the gray , horizonless sterility in which his mind seemed trapped and transfixed . . . . Or of the world he lived in ; of the dark , looming shapes that were arising everywhere from the world 's corruption  --  drawing always closer  --  faceless , swarming , obscene ... . He got up and went to the washbasin and began slowly and carefully to soap his hands . I am a bomber pilot , he said to himself quietly . I am an American bomber pilot who had to bail out over Switzerland and by a rather fantastic coincidence came down in a place which I once knew . I am probably a little shaken and a little tired , and I am waiting to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is all there is to it . Those arc the facts . But it was not facts that he wanted . It was the truth. 74Chapter 5he rays of the setting sun streamed eastward over Europe . They slanted across the plains of Germany , the brown hills of Italy and the fields and vineyards of France . They moved gently over the gutted meadows , the torn forests , the blackened , smoking cities , the gun emplacements , the tank traps , the long brown and gray columns that crept endlessly along the roads . They flickered briefly on the wings of soaring planes and on the corrodedsteel of helmets lying half-buried in the mud . They shone rich and glowing on the spires of Cologne cathedral and on the still , huddled figures of the three pigtailed schoolgirls lying side by side on the cobbles of the marketplace of Arnhem . They struck shining fire on the still , white summits of the Alps . The sun , huge and golden , hung impaled on the rugged rockspineof the Burggen Ridge . Then it disappeared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . It fell on the trim lawns and white gables of the Gasthof , on the meadows and vegetable patches , on the slanting forests and twisting paths and the cold silver ribbon of the Aarn . It raced up the mountainsides , past glacier and snowfield , precipice and ice-wall , to the skyline ridges . For a few moments the peaks stood aloof , white and blazing in the light from beyond the horizon . Then , one by one , the twilight climbed their summits : first the lower ones , then the greater , finally the greatest . On the very pinnacle of the White Tower there was a last tiny glint of fire . The next instant it was75gone , and the mountain rose gray and gleaming against the darkeningsky . In the valley the bells tinkled as the sheep descended from the upper pastures , and the Aarn still rumbled among its ancient stones . There was no other sound within the unbroken circle of the peaks . I-Ierr Knubel peered through the glass panel in the swinging door and waited until Annamarie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next ten minutes moved methodically about , looking into the stove , the sinks , the icebox and the corners of the cupboard shelves . His inspection completed , he walked down the empty hall to the two-room wing which served him and Frau Knubel as living quarters . His wife was at the table in the sitting room , making entries in the big red-and-black-bound ledger . Knubel sat down in an armchairand took off his shoes . " Das Dreckmadel , " he said . " You would think it was the cockroacheswe are paying her to feed . " Frau Knubel continued scratching in the ledger . " Besides , I think she 's smuggling food out to that no-good family of hers . " " Maybe you wo n't have to be fussing about it so much longer , " his wife said . " Why ? What do you mean ? She has n't given notice , has she ? " " No . But people expect to get paid , you know . Even for feeding cockroaches . " Herr Knubel got up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of figures . Shc had taken a six-weeks ' bookkeeping course at a business school in Basle twenty years before , and he had never been able to understand their finances since . He sighed , returned to his chair and sat tugging meditatively at his long nose . " A chef we once had , " he said . " A chef , two assistant chefs , one baker , eight waitresses , two busboys , three kitchenmaids . Now we can not pay for one cretin with kleptomania and a goitre . " His wife ran her pen down a line of figures , counting half-aloud . " Eight mouths we were feeding , with four paying . Now it is nine mouths , and still four paying . " " He will pay in time , do n't worry . " 76 " In time . To be sure . Along with the peace treaties and other reparations . I 'm sure that will make Miinz the grocer very happy . " Frau Knubel pushed back the ledger , removed the pince-nez she was wearing and looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andreas say , eh ? " " About Herr Ordway ? " " Yes . " " He thinks he can get him out all right . " " How soon ? " Knubel shrugged . " In a few days perhaps . A week . Two weeks . " " And he will stay here until then ? " " Where else is there for him to go ? " Frau Knubel was silent a moment , biting her thin lip . " We could get in trouble with this , of course , " she said . " We could . It is not likely though . " " Why not ? " " It is not likely anyone will find out about him . " " But if they do ? " Knubel shrugged again . " We go to jail , I suppose . Or pay a fine . " " Pay a fine ! " His wife laughed harshly . " With what , may I inquire ? I thought already things were so bad they could not get worse . Now we pick up someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a counterfeit sou , and if the authorities find out he is here we go to jail . " " It is not easy , " Knubel agreed . " But what is there to do ? Would you have me report him ? " Again his wife did not answer at once . She put her pince-nez back on , pulled the ledger toward her and began running the pen down a new column . " No , " she said at last in a scarcely audible voice . " I would not have you report him . " Her pen scratched on , and Knubel sat quietly pulling at his nose . Presently he got up , crossed in stockinged feet to the window and pushed back the faded net curtains . He stood for several minutes looking out into the purple dusk . " This was the time they used to come back , " he said softly . " From the picnics and the climbs . They used to come down out of the Aarntal Path over there and pile their boots and axes in the hall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baths and the young ones would go into the bar . They always began to sing77in the bar , and you always got angry about it . Remember those three young couples who came down every July from Rotterdam ? Every Saturday night they used to have one kirsch too many and sing their damn heads off . " He was silent again , peering into the distance . " Everyone was down by this time , except the high climbers . On a clear night like this you could sometimes see their torches way up there , coming down one after the other over the glaciers . Even without the telescope you could see them . " He stood looking out for another few moments ; then he let the curtains fall , pulled down the shade and returned to the armchair . Opening a carved pinewood box , he took out a long , thick cigar , removed it carefully from its wrapping , bit a small neat hole in the end and lighted it . Then he leaned back in his chair , watchingthe blue clouds of smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to save your cigars , " his wife said , looking up . " Save them ? " IIerr Knubel shook his head and sighed a little . " And what is there to save them for ? " lre asked . Nicholas Radcliffe arose from the table , a finger marking his page in Geikic 's Fossiliferous and Other Limestones , which he was re-reading . As lie was about to leave the ( lining room , however , Mrs. Meach appeared from the kitchen with a dish in her hand . " You 've forgotten your dessert , " she said reprovingly . " I do n't believe I 'll have any tonight , " Radcliffe said . " But it 's plum duff . " " I'in afraid I 'm not quite up to it . Put it in the icebox and perhaps I 'll cat it before I go to bed . " " And how about your tea , sir ? " " I may have that later too . " Shaking her square head disapprovingly , Mrs. Meach retreated into the kitchen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He read for only a few minutes , however . Presently he got up , took his flute from its case in a corner cupboard and went with it out onto the small verandah of the chalet . He did not play it , but held it idly across his knees as he sat down on the verandah steps and looked out across the darkening valley . It had been seventeen years since he first looked at the valley78from these steps , almost thirty since he had first seen it from the village below . Every form and feature of it was as familiar to him as his own body or the clothing he wore : the clustered gables and the brown steeple of the church ; the white-roofed inn ; the windingroad ( he knew every bend in it ) ; the rumbling Aarn ( he knew each pool and cataract ) ; even the individual stones and trees and patches of tilted pasture . He knew them all . He could see them now , each and all of them , spread out beneath him in the fading light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forests and scrublands , the gorges and waterfalls , to the empty world of rock and ice above . But it was not an empty world to him , for , even more than the valley , it was his home . He knew each detail of that austere and intricate masonry : each pass , each ridge , each glacier ; the black basaltic dyke on the south face of the Himmelshorn ; the reddish sandstone of the Karlsberg ; the moraines , the crevasses , the cornices , the tiny flakes of mica gleaming in the dusk of the sunless gullies . Cultivate your garden . . . . That was Voltaire  --  canny , dyspeptic old Voltaire  --  and how wise and true the words came down the years from the bright , tight , vanished little world of the Eighteenth Century . He had tried to live his life by those words . Above all else , he had valued and sought the power of concentration , of husbanding and directing his mind and energies , of mastery in the one field of human knowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his house , lonely , perhaps , but sound and strong , and cultivated his garden of rocks . He had shut out the weeds and jungle . He had shut out the night and the wind . And yet  --  Radcliffe 's blue eyes still travelled upward  --  and yet the wind still blew . Beyond the high encircling rampart of the peaks it blew in a wild dark tide across the ravaged face of the continents and oceans . Staring upward through the still twilight , he could see it raising a fine fringe of spume along the white ridges of the skyline . Closing his eyes , he could feel it stirring , cold and fitful , through every duct and adit of his body . He was staring at the peaks again . His gaze moved over gorge and glacier , ridge and precipice , past the Rotalp , the Graf , the Grafin , the Himmelshorn , down into the deep blue shadows of the icefields , then slowly upward along the pure and terrible79symmetry of the Weissturm . It moved up the gleaming snowslopes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiering ledges and thrusting ridges , until it rested at last on the gentle white dome of its summit . In all that vast sweep of space and silence only one thing moved . From the topmost pinnacle of the dome a thin thread of snow streamed eastward in the wind against the evening sky . For a long time Radcliffe sat motionless , his eyes raised , his flute lying idly across his bony knees . And presently , as he still stared , it seemed to him that another shape was slowly taking form behind the soaring outline of the Tower . A greater shape . The greatest of all shapes . Through the gulfs of twilight he could almost see the two tiny figures creeping upward along that forlorn and timeless ridge . Mallory . . . Mallory .. . He had been dead twenty years . It was twenty years ago that June that the mist had closed in over the East Ridge of Everest and he and Irvine were gone . And all the rest were gone too . Not dead , perhaps , like George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loneliness of the Ilinialayan night ; but gone none the less . The young men that they all had been were gone . ... Why did they return , then ? Why did they keep coming back into his thoughts , into his garden  --  those lost , long-gone , forgotten young men , with their boots and their windburned faces and their laughter and their young eyes squinting upward at the peaks ? Young men like Mallory , like Irvine .. . Like Ordway . Radcliffe closed his eyes again and shook his head a little , as if to clear it . Perhaps that was what it was , he thought . Perhaps it was the young aviator that had set his mind off on its bemused wanderings  --  the big dark-eyed young American in his too-small borrowed clothes , standing smiling in the doorway . Presently he raised his flute from his knees and began playing the serenade from Die Zauberflote. lle played slowly and softly , listening to how the sound seemed to travel down the slope before him , move across the still valley and flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . It was dark when he finished playing . Going inside , he put the flute away , got the plum duff and a cup of tea from the kitchen8oand settled down to the next chapter of Fossiliferous and Other Limestones . When Andreas Benner finished feeding the chickens he watered the leeks and radishes and prodded the sick goat into its shed . Then he went into the kitchen and sat down . " I thought you were playing joss down at the Dyhrenfurths ' tonight , " his wife said . " No , " he said , " I do not feel like playing cards . " She looked at him curiously over her shoulder from the tub where she was cleaning a fowl , but he did not continue . For several minutes he sat motionless in his chair , staring at the knotted veins on the backs of his thick brown hands . " You are on patrol tomorrow ? " his wife asked without turning . " No . " " I thought Tuesdays you were always on patrol . " " Usually I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused a moment . " Tomorrow I must go down to Interlaken . " Frau Benner turned and looked at him again . " To Interlaken ? Y  --  , y " I have business there . " " What kind of business ? " Benner did not answer . She waited a moment , then wiped her hands on a rag and came around and faced him . " It is business about that Amerikaner , is n't it ? " " Yes , " Benner said . " You are going to get yourself in trouble with that Amerikaner . " " I do not think so . " " You think you can get him out ? " " Yes . " " And if they catch you ? " Benner shrugged . " If they catch you there will be the devil to pay . You are a member of the Patrol Corps . " " I am a guide . " " You used to be a guide . Now you are a member of the Patrol Corps , working for the canton . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And this American was once a Herr of mine . We climbed together many times , years ago . " " You had hundreds of Herren . I suppose if they all fell from8ithe sky onto our doorstep  --  the Americans and English and Frenchmenand Germans and Swedes and all the rest of them  --  you would decide it was your duty to rent a special train and drop each of them off at his home ? " Benner did not seem to be listening . " He was a good Bergstcigcr , that boy , " he went on quietly . " A little wild , perhaps , but good . Once I pulled him out of a crevasse in the Diirrengletscher . Another time we got caught in a storm and spent all night out on the north ridge of the Wunderhorn . In the morning we took off our wet clothes and lay on a ledge in the sun , and the bread and cheese was all spoiled , but there was still a flask of wine , and he found in his pocket some American chocolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was for him I went the highest that any guide since my father has gone on the Weissturin . He and Fraulein Dehn and that Wiener boy  --  they were trying to climb it alone , die Esel , and I went up and pulled them down . " He fell silent and sat staring again at the backs of his hands . He heard his wife 's voice rising and falling and saw her round red face grow rounder and redder , but he did not say anything . Then at last he saw that she was finished . " Well ? " she asked . " You do not agree with me ? " " You have all the right reasons , as usual , " he said . " And you will do as you please , as usual , I suppose ? " He shook his head slowly . " Not as I please , Liebchen . As I think right . " After a few minutes he got up and went out into the doorway . He filled his pipe and lighted it and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dusk at the snow-peaks and listening to the deep , tireless rumbling of the Aarn . Then he arose and went inside again . Avoiding the kitchen , he climbed the stairs , opened a creaking door and entered a musty slope-ceilinged attic . A kerosenelamp hung from a crossbeam in the center of the room , and he went over and lighted it . He stood looking about him in the flickering yellow glow . Against the wall , near the door , was a neat row of five pairs of shoes . Three of the pairs were boots , with oiled leather uppers and tricouni nails glinting dully around the edges of the thick soles ; the other two were Kletterschulre of rope and canvas . Beyond the shoes , in the corner , was a pile of sharp-spiked crampons and an82open packing-box filled with pitons , karabiners , hammers and leather slings . Along the side wall , on a long row of nails , hung corduroy and dark woolen knickerbockers , faded flannel shirts , sweaters , a large and a small rucksack , a water-flask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt hats and a green hat with a fragment of a hawk 's feather in the band . In the far corner , on the floor , lay coil upon coil of carefully braided rope , ranging in color from brash , gleaming yellow to weathered coffee-brown . Above the rope , three ice axes hung from hooks in the wall . Benner walked slowly across the room and took the axes , one by one , from their hooks . He unfastened the leather shields and stood for several moments running his thumb gently along the cold , lightly greased steel of the blades . " Andreas ! " his wife 's voice came up from below . He put the axes back in their sheaths , hung them on the hooks , blew out the kerosene lamp and started down the stairs . " You might help me get rid of all these feathers and guts , " his wife called irritably from the kitchen . Paul Delambre turned the stem of the brandy glass in his long fingers and stared meditatively at the rich amber liquid . Ile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inn , and there was no sound except the soft clicking of her knitting needles . He drank down the brandy and resumed reading L'Immoraliste . .... What frightens me , I admit , is that I am still very young . It seems to me sometimes that my real life has not begun . Take me away from here and give me some reason for living . I have none left . I have freed myself . That may be . But what does it signify ? This objectless Iiberty is a burden to me . It is not , believe me , that I am tired of my crime  --  if you choose to call it that  --  but I must prove to myself that I have not overstepped my rights . Look ! I have here a number of white pebbles . I let them soak in the shade , then hold them in the hollow of my hand and wait. .  --  He reached for the bottle on the tabouret and refilled his glass . He sipped the brandy slowly as he continued reading . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her knitting into a blue mesh bag . " Are you coming up ? " she asked . 83 " No , not yet . " Delambre closed the book . " I think I shall do some writing tonight . " " To whom ? " " Not to anyone . On my book . " " Oh . " " Why do you say oh ' and look at me like that ? " " It is a long time now since you have worked on your book . " " And if it is ? Is that any reason why I should not begin again ? Perhaps you forget , ma cherie , that that is what I am  --  a writer . " " There is no need to get upset about it , " she said placidly . " Upset ? Who is upset ? " He watched her as she crossed the lounge and ascended the ' stairs , her yellow hair glinting and her thighs smooth and full under the clinging fabric of her skirt . Then he got up and went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his pocket , he laid it on the table and sat down . After a moment he arose again , went back to the tabouret and got the brandy bottle and glass . He sat down again , filled the glass and began turning the leaves of the notebook . On the first page was written L'Ame Qui Ric , par Paul Delambre , and , at the bottom , 2me Juillct , 1940 . The next ten or twelve pages were filled with script , about half of it clean , the other half blackened with x 's and deletion lines . The rest of the book was blank . Delambre read through two or three of the pages , tore them from the book and , crumpling them in his hand , dropped them in the wastebasket under the table . He took a sip from the glass and turned to the first blank page . IIe was no longer so young , he wrote , and sometimes the thought filled him with fear . For his true life , he knew , his life of the spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to seek , to find  --  to win from the dark chaos of the world the secret of .. . His pen stopped moving across the page , and for several minutes he sat staring at the scarred surface of the table . Then he drew a thick black line through what he had written , refilled his glass and began writing again . It did not seem to go right , however . He wrote , crossed out , wrote , crossed out ; then he tore out the page and threw it in the wastebasket and sat meditatively sipping his brandy and studying the complex paint-flake pattern of the table-top . It was not until84he went out onto the terrace for a breath of air that his thoughts fell into a clear , cohesive pattern . Then , staring up through the darkness at the white silence of the peaks , he felt the strength and vitality returning to him  --  felt the vast , complex congeries of images and ideas that thronged his mind emerge again in pure and burning clarity . A thrill of exhilaration passed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could think and feel again ! He would write again ! Not tonight , perhaps  --  no , not in the tired fagendof a spent day , that would be simply a waste  --  but in the morning , when the sunlight was rich in the blue sky and his energies were fresh and keen . He would sit down then , serenely , strongly , and the things that he must say would pour from him as from a great geyser out of the earth . IIe would write and write ... . Going up the stairs , his foot slipped on the worn carpet and his knee came down heavily on the step . He only smiled , however , and he smiled again when he discovered that he had turned the wrong way in the second-floor hall and was opening the wrong door . He retraced his steps and went into his room . The small silk-shaded bed lamp was the only light burning , and the hideous hotel furniture and vomitous green carpet were mercifullyblurred in shadow . But the Van Gogh and the ToulouseLautrecgleamed at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white outlines against the dark-blue and russet background of his bookshelves ; the Tanagra dancers rose , slim and exquisite , from among the jars and bottles on the dressing table . For a passinginstant it almost seemed to him that he was entering his old room in the house on the Rue Castellane . His wife lay on the bed , filing her nails . She had undressed and was now wearing a sheer powder-blue night-garment that revealed her lush body almost as completely as if she had been nude . Delambre 's eyes moved over the long , tapering legs , the rounded , full-fleshed thighs , the soft curve of her belly , the high , firm breasts pressing against their sheath of silk . The skin of her arms and shoulders was a gleaming pink in the soft light of the bed lamp , and her hair , thrown loosely behind her on the pillow , was a cascade of dull gold . " You did not write long , " she said , without looking up . " No , " he replied . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had finished stood at the85window in his pajamas and bathrobe , staring out at the night . His hands felt cold and moist , and he rubbed them slowly up and down against the rough wool of the robe . " Have we no cognac in the room ? " he asked . " You had it downstairs , " his wife said . " That 's finished . I mean the rest . " " It 's in the closet . Only  --  " " Only what ? " " Do n't you think you have had enough ? " " No , " he said . " Most definitely I have not had enough . " He got the bottle from the closet , opened it and poured himself a glass . When he had drunk it his hands felt warmer and he went back to the window . " I think I may do a bit of a climb tomorrow , " he said . " A climb ? " " Oh nothing very strenuous . Up to the hut , perhaps . Just to get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only sound from the bed was the thin scraping of the nail-file . " I used to do quite a bit of mountaineering , you know . Mont Blanc , the Jungfrau  --  " Still his wife said nothing . Dclambrc 's gaze moved up and out- ward through the night to where the immense silhouette of the White Tower rose gleaming against the stars . He felt again , as he had earlier on the terrace , a sudden cold , clean wind of exhilara- tion flowing through his blood and bones . " A man has need of many things , " he said . " There are times when he needs the things of the body and times when he needs the things of the mind . And there arc other times when lie needs none of these , but only the great simplicities  --  the mountains , the sea , the sky . Men can not live by intelligence and graciousness alone . Any more than nations can . Any more than France could . They must have in them not only tempered steel , but granite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but do .

He will be the **25;999;TOOLONG of the Twentieth Century ; the doer ; the Tatmensch . Over against him will be the man of thought and sensitivity , the artist-philosopher . Separately , each by himself , they 86 are sterile , impotent , lost  --  two aimless spinning neutrons in a void . But put them together , integrate them , and they become an atom , a force . The man who is these two men in one : he and he only is the complete man . Whatever may happen to him , whatever he is called upon to endure , he remains strong , unassailable , unvan-quished . " For a few minutes Delambre stood motionless at the window , gazing upward ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped filing her nails and was lying back on the pillows with her eyes lightly closed and her arms twined in her hair above her head . The bodice of her nightdress had come loose and sloughed to the side , exposing the soft white mound of one breast . It was rising and falling gently with her breathing , and the pointed nipple was pink and gleaming in the faint light of the bed lamp . A sudden blind anger shook him . " Mindless slut ! " he shouted . " Kitchen maid ! " He stood looking aimlessly about him , his heart pounding , his hands opening and closing . His eyes fell on the brandy bottle , and he poured himself out a drink , spilling half of it down the front of his bathrobe . He drank what was left of it , poured out a second drink and drank it more slowly . When he had finished he set the glass down , walked over to the bed and stood looking clown at his wife . She still lay without stirring  --  relaxed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes and looked up at him . With a low murmur that was almost a sob he sank down on the bed beside her . He passed his hands tenderly over her hair , her cheeks , her throat , her breasts . " Astrid , " he whispered . " Be kind to me . Be kind and sweet and loving to me , Astrid , my love . " She raised a hand and passed it lightly , almost perfunctorily , over his hair . Presently he reached out and switched off the bed lamp , so that he could no longer see the contempt in her cool violet eyes . It was already dark when Siegfried Hein and Hans Mohler trudged up the twisting road to the inn and climbed the stairs to their room . They put their rope and axes in the closet , undressed and rubbed their bodies vigorously with alcohol. 87 " Stiff ? " Mohler asked . Hein shook his head . " I 'm as creaky as an old hinge . " " Nonsense , " Hein said . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He flexed his arms and legs and watched with satisfactionhow the firm , resilient muscles sprang to life under the pink-white flesh . " Another two or three days ' exercise and I 'll be ready for a real climb . " He resumed rubbing himself , singing snatches of a Bavarian mountain song : " Er geht an 's Berg hinauf , Er steigt bis in die Hoh , Gewinnt das blitzend ' ZieI Fur Deutschland . .. " He was interrupted by a knocking on the door , and a moment later Herr Knubel appeared , carrying two letters . " These came in the noon delivery , " he explained . " They were in your box . " Hein took them and handed one to Mohler . They were in identical envelopes and postmarked Stuttgart . " The Herrschaften have had their dinner ? " Knubel inquired . Hein nodded . " In the village . " " Do the Herrschaften wish for anything else ? " " Thank you , no . " The innkeeper left . Then the two men opened the letters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mohler said . " That means leaving here tomorrow . " Ilcin stood motionless without speaking , his gray eyes narrowed and his lips compressed into a thin line . Suddenly he crumpled the letter in his hand and threw it on the bed . " The adjutant at the Rcgicrungsamt , " he said . " You know what that means , do n't you ? " Mohler nodded . " It means they 're going to put us behind desks . It means they think we 're not good enough to lead troops any more . " Hein 's hands were balled into tight fists at his sides . " Gottverdammt , they ca n't do it ! I am a field officer . I have commanded men for four years  --  in Norway , Jugoslavia , Greece , Russia . They ca n't kick me around like that and shove me behind some counter in a supply-office ! " 88He began pacing up and down the room with quick , angry strides . Mohler watched him in silence . " I do n't like it either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can we do ? " " Plenty . " " Such as what ? " " I 'll think of something . " Hein stopped pacing suddenly and stood staring out the window into the darkness . " You have to report on the fifth too ? " Mohler asked . Hein did not answer , and he repeated the question . " No . The nineteenth . My inactive status did n't start until two weeks after yours . " Hein gave a bitter little laugh . " And they obviously do n't want to have me around any sooner than they have to . " " Will you come back to Stuttgart tomorrow , then ? " " I do n't know . " Hein turned from the window and sat down in one of the chairs . The violent anger that had seized him had passed , and his voice was again low and even . " I do n't think so . I think perhaps I shall stay on another few days . " " You might as well . " " I can get in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's anyone to climb with . " " There 's that broken-down Frenchman  --  he 's always gabbing about what a mountaineer he is . Or there 's the new one ... " Hein fell silent a moment , musing . " What do you make of him , Hans ? " he asked . " The tall one on the Aarntal path ? " " Yes . " " I think he is an Englishman . " Mohler waited briefly . " Do n't you ? " " No . " " What is he then ? " " An American . " " What makes you think so ? " " I can tell . There is a difference . " " How do you think he got here ? " " There are many ways , I suppose . Some Americans live in Switzerland . Diplomats and that sort of thing . On the other hand  --  " 89 " He might be a spy . Or an escaped prisoner . " " Or almost anything . " Hein shrugged . " After all , look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civilian clothes  --  papers in order  --  and no questions asked . " " Arc you going to check up on him ? " " Later , perhaps . " Hein passed a hand meditatively over his chin . " I think perhaps I shall get a little better acquainted first . " He got up , went to the window again and stood looking out into the night . Mohler brought out a suitcase from the closet and began packing his clothes . Neither spoke for a while . " Do you know what I should like to do ? " Hein said suddenly . " What ? " " Before I leave here , I 'd like to make one real climb . " " What do you mean , real ? " " The kind we used to do before the war , on the Matterhorn faces and the Eigerwand . A seventh-degree ascent . A great ascent . I 'd like to arrive at the Regicrungsarnt in Stuttgart two weeks from tomorrow and salute smartly and say , Oberleutnant Hein reporting for duty , sir . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece , Russia . I have been twice wounded and awarded the Iron Cross and the Medal of Valor . I have just returned from a month on inactive status , sir , during which it was my good fortune and privilege to make the first ascent of the Weissturm from the Kandermatt Valley , for the greater glory of Fuhrer and Vaterland . And now , Ilerr Kommanclant , you may kick me behind my desk along with the rest of the worn-out , gutless old men . ' " Hein 's voice had gradually risen as he spoke . Now he stopped abruptly and was silent again . " You want to try the Weissturm ? " Mohler said after a moment . " Not try it . Climb it . " " They say it 's impossible from this side . " " They said the Eigerwand and the north face of the Matterhornwere impossible . " " Yes , but  --  " " But we climbed them . " Mohler continued packing . Hein remained for a while at the window , staring up at the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crossed the room slowly and stretched himself out on his bed. 90 " Yes , " he said presently . " I think I may try a bit of mountaineeringwith our tall , mysterious young American visitor . I think I might rather enjoy showing him what a broken-down , combatfatigued , pen-pushing nincompoop of a German Wehrmachtsoffiziercan do . " Carla Dehn walked in the darkness along the winding road . She had been walking since mid-morning , stopping only at long intervals to rest in a green clearing or on a flat rock beside the Aarn ; but she was still not tired . Her footsteps held to their slow , unbroken rhythm on the rutted earth , as she came around still another familiar curve and the white gables of the inn swung into view against the forests and the peaks . Except for the rare times when she had been ill , this was the first day in nearly two years that she had not spent most of the morning and afternoon at her work around the inn . She had set about it as usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foyer and helping Frau Knubel with the daily marketing list . For almost three hours she had succeeded in focussing her eyes and mind on bedspreads , dusty corners and the outrageous price of mutton ribs . Then the moment came when she could do it no longer . Murmuring a meaningless excuse to Frau Knubel , she had walked from the house , across the terrace , down the slopes of the knoll and along the road . Hour after hour she had walked : up and down the familiar woodland paths , through the tall , slanting belts of larch and spruce , among the gray , weathered boulders of the rumbling Aarn . Now , walking home again at last through the dark stillness , it seemed to her that the river 's tumult was still dinning in her ears . The Aarn was already half a mile behind her , but she knew it did not matter . She could put it a mile , ten miles , the breadth of the Alps behind her ; she could return to her work , eat , sew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed in the darkness and press the heels of her hands against her ears . And still it would make no difference . The flood was loose again , and its sound would follow her wherever she went , whatever she did  --  always louder , deeper , more imperious . A man had come to the quiet valley , and her peace was gone . A stranger  --  yes , yes , she thought bitterly , he is a stranger now  --  had come impossibly , fantastically down from91the night under his silken shroud , and the peace she had struggled so hard for through the long years and won for herself at last was shattered into a thousand quivering fragments . She stopped suddenly and stood at the roadside pressing the tips of her fingers against her closed eyelids . Then she dropped her hands to her sides and held them there until they no longer trembled . " He is a stranger , " she said . Presently she began walking again . The road ran for a way between open fields , then through a stand of timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just beyond the bridge was the beginning of the narrow side-road that wound up the knoll to the inn . Reaching it , she hesitated ; then she began the ascent . Five minutes later she was walking quickly across the dark , seemingly deserted terrace . But it was not deserted . As she neared the kitchen door a tall figure separated itself from the surrounding shadows and approached her . She felt she was going to run , but instead she stopped and stood quite still . " You frightened mc , " she said . " No , I did n't , " said Martin Ordway . " You knew I 'd be here . " She did not answer . " Why have you been avoiding me ? " he asked . " I have n't . Truly I have n't . " " Where have you been all day , then ? " " Down in the village . " " You 're still a bad liar , " he said , smiling . It was a moment before she spoke again . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not understand , but it is different now . I am not a guest here any mare , as I once was . I work here now . There is always something to be done , and Frau Knubel sends me on errands  --  " " Up the Aarntal ? " " How do you know ? " She was staring up at him , and her voice was edged . " A scout is alert . IIe is also trustworthy , loyal , brave , clean and tells the truth . You 'd make a hell of a scout . " " Oh , you are impossible ! You 're  --  " " Unverschamt ? " 92 " Yes , unverschamt ! " He laughed . " Good . And now that we 've finally agreed on something , will you please stop playing The Mysterious Veiled Lady and talk to me like a human being ? " " But , Martin , I do n't  --  " He had cupped her elbow in his hand and was leading her across the terrace . When they came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . " Now swing around , " he told her . They swung and sat facing the steep slope of the knoll and valley and mountains beyond . " It 's better when the feet dangle . " He took his cigarettes from his pocket and held them out to her . " No , thank you , " she said . " They 're Camels . " She hesitated . " And I 'm sure the Herr Doktor Justitzrat Naffziger is safely in his featherbed by now . " He took a cigarette from the pack , lighted it and handed it to her . Then he lighted one for himself . " At least I can still make you smile , " he said . They were silent for a while , seated side by side on the big , smooth stones of the wall . The moving tips of their cigarettes made a tiny orange tracery in the darkness , and the gray smoke rose straight up into the windless night . " Carla  --  " he said . " Yes ? " " What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " What is it that 's the matter ? Why are you here in Kandermatt ? Why are you acting this way ? " The girl did not answer . " Are n't you glad to see me again ? " " Oh , yes , Martin . Yes . " For a moment he could feel her eyes on him ; then she turned her head away . " It 's only that  --  " She hesitated and stopped . " Go on , " he said . " That things arc different . " " The valley is n't different . The forests and the mountains and the stars  --  they are n't different . " " No , " she said quietly . " They stay the same . But we do n't stay93the same , Martin , We grow older . Things happen to us . We change . " " You have n't changed . " She started to speak , but he did not let her . " That first instant yesterday afternoon , when I found you standing out here and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mist  --  in that first instant I said to myself : No , she has n't changed . She 's a woman now , not a little girl any longer . But she 's still Carla . She 's still  --  " He stopped and looked at her in the darkness . " Still what , Martin ? " " Lovely . " They fell silent again . Ordway flicked his cigarette away and watched the thin glowing streak disappear into the shadows below . " I should be going in , " the girl said suddenly . " No . Not yet . " He put his hand on her arm . " Tell me about yourself . About what you do here . " " I 've told you . I work . I dust and make beds and help Frau Knubcl with the marketing . " " And lie out on the pine needles at night , counting the stars above the Tower ? " It was a moment before she answered . " No , " she said then , " I do not do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meadows ? And the glaciers ? Do you lie on the straw mattresses in the Ilcilwcg IIut and listen to the glaciers rumbling in the dark like tired old lions ? " He paused and laughed softly . " Do you remember the night you wanted Stefan and me to stand guard because you were afraid of the rats ? And we explained to you that you were squealing so loud the rats had already run for their lives ? " Ile paused again . The girl was sitting beside him , motionless , her head turned away. " rell me about Stefan , " he said . " Where is he ? Do you ever see him ? " " Please , Martin  --  " The sound seemed to have been ripped out of her , half words and half a sob . ' With a quick , convulsive gesture she swung herselfaround and in another moment would have been running across the terrace . Ordway swung around after her and caught her by the arm . " Do n't ! Do n't ! " She pleaded . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin , Martin  --  what is it you want of me ? " He gripped her arm tightly in his hand and looked down at her . Gradually , almost imperceptibly , the pull against it lessened , and presently she was no longer pulling away at all . He let his hand slip gently down her forearm until it held hers . " I want you to meet me at the top of the west pasture at nine tomorrow morning , " he said . " We 're going to walk up the path to the hut . " " I ca n't . " " Yes you can . " " But I must n't . My work  --  " " You can get out of it . " She started to speak again , but her voice trailed away inaudibly . Her breath was coming in short , sharp jerks and she held her head averted . " You do n't want to go ? " he asked . " Oh yes , yes I do . Only  --  " He released her hand . " At nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised her head . For a moment he could see the faint glint of her eyes through the darkness . " Goodnight , Carla , " he said . " Goodnight , Martin . " " Binks , " he said . " Goodnight  --  Binks . " Ordway lighted another cigarette and for several minutes walked slowly up and down across the terrace . Then he entered the inn , passed through the empty lounge , went up the stairs and into his room . When he had undressed he turned out the light and lay on the bed staring into the darkness . A wisp of breeze touched the curtains at the open window and set them gently stirring . He watched them for a while , then got up again , went to the window and looked out . The valley of Kandermatt lay black and still before him . There was no sound . Nothing moved . In the distance the valley rose to the forests , the forests to the rocks , the rocks to the glaciers , the glaciers to the peaks . The peaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest loomed the White Tower , withdrawn in space and silence , brooding over the night . It seemed to Ordway as far away as the stars that circled it . As far away as a world at war. 95Chapter 6He reached the head of the pasture , rounded a patch of wild gooseberry bushes and found her sitting on a low rock beside the path . She was wearing a short woolen skirt and green shetland sweater , white anklets and stout walking shoes . A brown paper bag lay on the grass beside her . " You 're early , " he said . " I was afraid if I did n't get away early I would not get away at all . " She looked up at him and smiled . " Were you thinking that perhaps I would not come ? " " No , I was n't thinking that . " He put out his hands , and she took them and got to her feet . Then he looked questioningly at the paper bag . " Lunch , " she said . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like lunch . And I knew even twelve years could n't change you that much . " Ordway said " Oh " again and compressed the grin from his lips . " I 've decided to retain my dignity , " he announced . IIe picked up the bag , tried unsuccessfully to squeeze it into two or three pockets , and finally stuffed it down the front of his sweater . " If the gnadiges Fraulcin will excuse a temporary pot-belly until  --  " " Until the cheese starts to melt . Of course , mein Kapitan . " She laughed again , and he laughed back , fished out the bag and96held it in his hand . There was a moment 's silence as he stood looking at her . " Shall we start ? " Carla asked . They followed the twisting path through alternating patches of grass and berry-bushes , crossed a wire fence on a rickety stile and entered the lower fringes of the forest . For perhaps half an hour they moved upward through a green tunnel of oaks , beeches and maples . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt of mixed leaf-trees and conifers , and then presently the lighter greenery of the valley trees was gone altogether and they were climbing slowly through dark aisles of pine and balsam , larch and spruce . Every few hundred yards the path crossed a stream on a worn plank or chain of stepping-stones  --  quick , glinting freshets plunging noisily down the still forest slopes to the meadows and the Aarn . At intervals it emerged abruptly from the trees onto a bare rim of hillside , and they could see the valley floor spread out below , with its road and river , houses and fields . On the opposite slope , beyond , Radcliffe 's chalet showed as a minute reddish smudge against the steep green of the upper pastures . At the stream crossings they paused briefly , steadying each other across , and now and then they stopped at the open places , point ing out objects below . For the most part , however , they climbed uninterruptedly and without speaking . Carla went first , walking with a slow , easy rhythm , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the forest shade , her brown skirt and dark green sweater blended so harmoniously into the background that Ordway could scarcely see her from a few yards behind . Then suddenly a shaft of sunlight would strike down on her through the treetops , outlining her slender figure against the dark pine-boughs and touching her hair with bright copper fire . Ordway trudged steadily behind , his smooth-soled shoes slipping occasionally on the roots that veined the path , his breath coming evenly enough , but a little faster than he would have preferred . Every few minutes he paused and drew in a deep draught of air . It was mountain air , scented with balsam , pine-resin and distant snow , and it sucked down into his body with the clean , sparkling freshness of dry wine . It was growing perceptibly cooler , too , as they ascended , but no breeze stirred in the forest , and when they97Passed through the open patches of sunlight he could feel his back and shoulders going damp beneath his shirt . He stopped , pulled off his sweater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was shortly before eleven when they emerged from the trees onto a bold grass-covered promontory that hung out over the valley . They stood for a few minutes looking at the miniature world far below them , then sat down on the soft turf . " Remember it ? " Carla asked . Ordway nodded . " The Drachenfels . Pleasant forest walk , suit- able for timid ladies and older children . Time : two hours from upper pasture '  --  Baedeker . " " We made it in one hour and fifty-five minutes . Congratula- tions . " " It was nothing , gnadigcs Fraulcin . " Ordway lay back in the grass and stretched his legs . " At least , practically nothing . A few weeks ' rest and I 'll be as good as new . " They laughed , and he lay looking up at her and smiling , until she turned her head away . " You have n't climbed many hills lately , I suppose ? " she asked . " No , not many . " " Arc you sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ? " She did not answer . " Are you sorry ? " " No , I 'm not sorry . Yet . " " But you expect to be any minute ? " " I  --  I do n't know . " They were silent for a little while . Ordway rolled over onto his stomach and lay plucking idly at the grass . " It has n't been twelve years , " lie said . Again she did not answer . " It has n't been five years or one year or six months or six weeks . Time has n't anything to do with it . We were here before and now we 're here again  --  that 's all . " " Does it seem that way to you , Martin ? " " Does n't it to you ? " She shook her head slowly . " No . To me it seems so very long ago . " " Have I changed that much ? " " You ? " She studied him a moment . " I am not sure yet . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kandermatt . " He stared down at the valley . " Last night after you left me I walked around out on the terrace trying to put my thoughts in order , and the more I tried the more I felt like one of those H. G. Wells professors who disappears into a time-machine and comes out the other end . The mountains , the valley , the road , the inn  --  all exactly as I remembered them . The Knubels , Andreas , Nick Radcliffe , yourself  --  " " All the others are gone , though . " " The others do n't matter . Except Stefan . " Iie paused again and looked at her . " What about Stefan , Carla ? " It was a moment before she answerd . " What do you mean , what about him ? " " Why would n't you tell me about him last night ? Why wo n't you now ? " " There 's nothing to tell , Martin . He is all right , I suppose . He lives in Vienna . I  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And that 's all ? " " Yes , that is all . " They were silent again , and he lay watching her . " Do n't , Martin , " she said . Her voice was barely audible . " Do n't what ? " " Do n't look at me that way . Please . " Ile reached out and put his hand over hers , resting on the grass beside her . She averted her eyes from his , but did not withdraw it . And suddenly he realized that she was waiting  --  and that he was waiting too . " Carla . " " Yes ? " " Carla , I  --  " Ile paused , and they waited . They waited for him to speak , to smile , to laugh ; to sit beside her closely as he had used to sit , one arm around her , the other pointing upward at the peaks ; to sweep away , in one quick time-obliterating gesture , the veils and barriersthat the years had set between them . ... Carla , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am afraid of those twelve years I was just now trying to pretend did not exist , and of what they have done to us . I am afraid , because now , with a sudden and terrible clarity , I am thinking of all the things I was going to do in the world and did n't , all the things99I once believed in and then forgot . We used to walk together along these mountain paths  --  remember ? We used to sit together on the grass slopes and rock ledges  --  you and Stefan and I  --  and you would lean forward with your chin in your hands , looking down into the valley , while Stefan made up his bright , fantastic stories of mountain-gods and mountain-devils . And when he was finished we would laugh a little , but only a little , because in those days there were many bright , fantastic things we believed in . We believed in the fundamental goodness of men  --  do you remember ? In laughter and contentment for their own sakes . In the future . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are here again . The tide of war , of chance , or whatever you choose to call it , has washed us up again on these old familiar mountainsides , ebbed for a moment and left us here . The valley is the same , the mountains are the same , even you and I are the same  --  and yet everything is different . What are we trying to say to each other ? And why is it that we can not say it ? I do n't know . Perhaps there are no words for the things that have happened to us in those twelve years . . . . But this much T do know , Carla : we can not let them go on happening to us any longer . Something has been lost and we must find it ; something has gone and we must get it back . These were the things he wanted to say . Getting stiffly to his feet and helping her up , he said : " It 's half-past eleven already . We 'd better be going if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond the Drachenfels the timber thinned rapidly . The path wound upward through a belt of dwarf pine , swarming with redstarts and quick , darting finches ; then , in a series of sharp switchbacks , across a steeply tilted zone of moss and scraggly mosshuggingshrubs . The forest receded until its tree-tops were a slantinggreen carpet far below . The soil was no longer a dark , loamy brown , but weathered gray , shot through with great swathes of wildflowers . They crossed a slope on which a wave of pink and skyblueprimulas rose in an unbroken sweep to the skyline . In the gravelled earth beside the path were hundreds of gleaming green cushions of campion moss studded with their tiny violet blossoms  --  exquisitely delicate and incredibly tough . Presently rocks began to appear among the grass and flowers : rooat first merely small scattered stones ; then tumbled heaps of boulders ; finally massive , monolithic outcroppings of living rock , forcing their way through the thin skin of earth and sprawling gray and glinting in the sunlight . Suddenly a mountain hare skitteredacross the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a boulder watched them motionlessly with unblinking eyes . Then they came up over the rim of a long slope and stopped . In one instant , it seemed to Ordway , they had passed from one world into another . In the one step it had taken to surmount the final rocky crest of the slope everything about them had changed as startlingly as if they had passed in a single timeless second from equator to pole . The valley had swung out of sight below . The neat little meadowsand houses of Kandermatt were gone  --  the Aarn , the village , the green pastures and forests , the soft multicolored slopes of moss and flowers , all were gone  --  and in their place was the desolategray-white world of the mountains . Ahead of them , for a distance of perhaps two miles , stretched a savage slanting wildernessof huge rocks  --  the great terminal moraine of the Durren Glacier . Beyond and above it loomed the thick white snout of the glacier itself and the gleaming expanse of the ice-field , and , still higher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a great irregular wedge into the sky . In that whole monstrous sweep of desolation only one thing moved and lived . Far away , from under the lip of the glacier , a milk-gray torrent of water plunged down over the rocks . Its spray flew upward and hung glittering in the still air . Other than this there was only silence and transfixion in the gray world above the forests . For an hour or more they followed the path upward among the boulders . The Karlsberg did not seem to grow nearer as they advanced , but merely larger and taller  --  an immense , white-skirted pyramid swinging majestically upward from the horizon to the zenith . Simultaneously , from behind it and on both sides , the rest of the great range rose mile by mile into view : snow-peaks and rock-peaks , piled tier on tier behind each other into the distance ; forlorn scree-slopes and glittering glaciers ; gorges , buttresses , precipices , ridges ; and between and beyond them all , framed in'orjagged notches and spreading upward to the summits in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clambering slowly behind Carla , Ordway stared up at the gray , white-hooded host . The Rotalp , the Dornelberg , the Graf and Grafin , the Wunderhorn and Himmelshorn and Wetteralp  --  they were all there , unchanged and unchanging , exactly as he rememberedthem . Only one was still missing . Only the greatest . For a brief moment as they topped one of the ridges of the boulder-slope it seemed to him that he had caught a glimpse of a pure white line climbing the sky behind the fanged ridge of the Dornelberg . But in the next instant it was gone . Like the storybook king among his courtiers , the Weissturm chose to remain hidden behind its encircling satellites until the time should come for it to reveal itself . By one o'clock they were directly beneath the Durren Glacier , and a few minutes later they crossed the stream that spouted out from under its lip . " The hut is just beyond the next rise , " said Carla , pointing . The boulders were enormous now and the path the merest twisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , however , they had crossed the remainder of the slope and Caine out on the abrupt ridge that marked the end of the moraine . Beyond it the ground fell away in a gentle slope into a small V-shaped pocket iii the mountainside . There was a thin silver stream flowing across its floor , a sparse carpet of moss and minute wildflowers between the rocks , and in its center the squat , weathered shape of the IIcilweg Hut . As they approached it there was a sudden scurrying sound and a fat brown marmot scampered off toward the boulders . Ordway ascended the three stone slabs to the door and tried it . It was locked . " Andreas says the Patrol leaves a key , " Carla said . She felt in a crevice beneath the steps and came up with one . Ordway opened the door and they stepped into the hut . It was no different from any of a hundred such huts scattered through the Alps from the Dauphine to the Ortler . There were rough stone walls , held together by great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting the steepslopingshingle roof ; a pile of straw mattresses in one corner androea small pot-bellied stove in another . In the center were a deal table and two benches , their unpainted surfaces covered with carved initials . A broom , an ax and a tin bucket stood against the wall , but the cupboard above them , that had once held a few cooking utensils and emergency supplies , was bare . Ordway walked slowly around the room . The fireplace was bare also and the stove pocked with rust . An Alpine Club bulletin on the inside of the door , dealing with climbing accidents and distresssignals , had yellowed and curled with age . " Let 's eat outside , " he said . Carla nodded and they left the hut . In the warm sunshine by the quick little stream the ghosts dissolved . Carla opened the paper bag and brought out a long loaf of fresh bread , two chicken legs and a great golden pat of Neufchatelcheese . Sitting on a bank of soft moss , they ate hungrily but slowly , savoring each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water from the stream . As they ate , the marmotthey had frightened away returned cautiously from the boulder-slope and sat watching them from the top of a near-by rock . Below the narrow green defile in which they sat the mountainsidecurved steeply away , and for the first time since they left the Drachenfels they could again see the valley of Kandermatt below . Incredibly tiny and remote it appeared now across the oceans of blue air  --  an insubstantial toy-world of brightly colored pasteboard spread on a green carpet far away . When he had finished eating , Ordway sat looking down on it for several minutes , his hands clasped about his knees . Then he lay back on the flowered moss , and the sun and sky and the great ragged wedge of the Karlsberg swam gently together before his half-closed eyes . " Martin  --  " " Yes ? " " Sing for me . " " I ca n't . " " You always used to sing . Right here . We would eat our lunch and lie out here on the moss and close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing . " " I ca n't any more , " he said . " I do n't remember the old songs any more . " 103 " Sing a new one then . One that you Americans sing in the war . " He shook his head . " This is n't the kind of war you do much singing in . " They were silent for a little while . " You are tired of war , are n't you , Martin ? " she asked . " Who is n't ? " " I mean tired in your bones . In your soul . " " I would n't know about my soul , I 'm afraid . Along with a few hundred million other people I seem to have misplaced it some-where . " " Do n't you believe in what you are fighting for ? " " Believe in it ? " He was silent a moment , squinting up into the golden sun . " Yes , I suppose I do . I believe it 's necessary that we fight . I believe that fascism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be wiped off the earth , if it 's to be any sort of an earth worth living on . " " Then  --  " " Yes , I still believe those things , " he said quietly . " At least I think I still believe them .... Only something seems to happen to you after a while . You fight for just so long . You fly out on so-and-so-many missions and drop so-and-so-many bombs . You destroy so-and-so-many cities , kill so-and-so-many people  --  at least in a plane you do n't know how many  --  and watch so-and-so-many friends die . And you know it 's necessary and that it 's your job and that that 's the kind of world you live in and all the rest of it . But something happens to you just the same . . . . " " You have been fighting for two years now , you said ? " " I 've been in Africa and Europe about that . I went into the army early in ' 42 . " " As a volunteer ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was an architect . " " Oh , then you did  --  " " Finish school ? Yes . Those two years at the Beaux Arts and then two more at home . Then I got a job in a New York office . " " How wonderful , Martin ! " " There was n't anything very wonderful about it , I 'm afraid . I was just beginning , of course , and even the established men were104having their troubles in those times . I managed to scrape along , though . The firm I was with seemed to have confidence in me , and finally , after about five years , gave me my first real job on my own  --  a development of workmen 's houses in a Rhode Island factory town . I was about halfway through when Pearl Harbor came along . The army wanted flyers , of course , and I knew how to fly , and that was that . " " I remember , you always wanted to fly , Martin . " Ile nodded . " Ever since May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that date ? " She thought for a moment and shook her head . " I was  --  let 's see  --  fourteen then and in my last year at LarchmontJunior High School . There 'd been a baseball game that afternoon against another school , and . I 'd made a home run with three men on base , and I remember  --  " " You made a what ? " she interrupted . " A home run in a baseball game . With the bases full . " " Oh . And that is good ? " " Well , it 's nothing to be ashamed of . . . . Anyhow , when I got home later I could hardly wait for my father to come in , so I could tell him about it . When he showed up at last I went out to the garage to meet him ; but I never told him about the home run , because there was the evening paper on the seat beside him , and there it was about Lindbergh . " " And from then on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " From then on every kid in the country knew he was going to be a flyer . Most of them grew up and forgot it , of course ; but I did n't forget it . All through high school my mind was made up that I was going to be an airline pilot . Then when I went to college I began getting interested in architecture too , and my father had a few talks with me , and things did n't work out that way . But I knew I was going to fly too , even if it was only on the side  --  and I did . " " You used to talk about it that summer , sitting right here where we are now . " " Yes , I used to talk about it . I used to dream about it . " Ordway paused a moment , squinting into the distance . " I still remember the first time I went up . It was the summer after I went back home , I think . The plane was just a pipsqueak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made seventy-five miles an hour with a hurricane behind it  --  but I still remember the hammering of that little motor and the sound the wind made pouring over the wings and the fuselage . I sat there in the front cockpit with my hands doubled into fists and kept saying to myself over and over again , This is what you 're made for  --  this is what you 're alive for , ' and I wanted to yell it right out at the top of my voice , only I was afraid the instructor would think I was frightened or crazy and call the whole thing off . " " It is a wonderful thing , Martin , when a person wants somethingthat much . And loves it that much . " " Yes  --  I loved flying . In a way , even , it was more than loving it . It was  --  well  --  believing in it . " He lapsed into silence again for a few moments . " When you 're a kid , Carla , believing comes easy . In flying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now you no longer believe in them ? " " I do n't know , " he said . " I do n't know . " They lay quietly again on the moss-cushioned bank . He moved his hand so that the cold bubbling water of the little stream passed over it and closed his eyes , watching the shifting play of sunlight beneath his lids . Then , presently , he opened his eyes again and turned his head and saw that she was watching him . IIe smiled a little . " So we are both afraid , you see , " he said . " Afraid ? " " Yes . Afraid and tired and trying to escape . Trying hopelessly and blindly to get back to where we once were . " He paused , but she did not speak . " Is n't that why you are here ? Is n't that why I am ? " She started to speak , stopped herself and looked away from him . " You are here because your plane broke down , " she said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't know anything about my reason . " " But that is what you 're going to tell me now . " " No , " she said . " No . " And then suddenly she was looking full in his face again . IIcr gray-green eyes were wide and staring and her whole body was trembling gently with a silent sob . " Oh , Martin , Martin  --  why have you come back ? " she cried. 106Ordway put his hand lightly over hers , without speaking . " I knew this was going to happen from the moment I heard you had come down in the meadow ; from that first instant I saw you on the terrace . " Her voice was low again , but the words came rapidly , almost wildly . " I have tried so hard to make a new life here  --  to work and find peace  --  to forget you and him and everything that had been . " " Him ? " " Stefan . " " Then you  --  " She did not speak for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of her breathing became slower and more even and her eyes seemed gradually to grow grayer and colder . " I married him , Martin , " she said . She paused briefly and looked away again . When she resumed speaking her voice was quiet and almost toneless . " We were married in Vienna in August , 1936 , when Stefan was twenty-three and I was just nineteen . We stayed there a few months while he was working in his father 's office ; then he got a position as a reporter on a newspaper in Linz  --  you remember he always wanted to write  --  and we went there to live . For almost two years we were very happy . Stefan did well on the paper , and they promoted him first to a more important reporting assignment and then to be one of the assistant editors . He was still as gay and handsome as ever , and everyone in town liked him . He was always kind and sweet to me , and  --  well  --  we loved each other . " Then in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no great excitement about it in Linz  --  much less than you would expect . One night everything was the way it had always been , and then the next morning the Germans were there . That 's all there was to it . Some of the people were for Schuschnigg , of course , some were for the Nazis , and a lot did n't know who they were for . But it all happened so quickly no one could do anything in any case . Stefan had never had much use for the Nazis  --  he had always said they were primarily a Prussian militarist organization , even though Hitler himself was an Austrian  --  but like everyone else , all he could do now was wait and see what happened . " The Germans closed the paper for a few days and began calling in the editors along with the other business and professional men107of the town . A few of them they turned over to the Gestapo and sent away , and the rest they told to go back to work . Finally it was Stefan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a night , while I waited and waited and thought I would go out of my mind ; and then at last , on the evening of the second day , he came home again . And the next morning he went back to work . " For a few months things almost seemed the same as they had always been . And then suddenly  --  or at least it was suddenly to me  --  Stefan was offered a position as assistant editor on one of the big weekly magazines in Vienna . It was a wonderful job for such a young man , and he took it , of course , and we went back to Vienna , and I was happier and prouder of him than ever . I can hardly believe now that I did n't know what was going on by that time . But I did n't yet . I was very young , I suppose , and in love  --  and I was going to have a baby . " She paused , and Ordway gently pressed the hand that lay beneath his on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyhow , " she went on , her voice low and even , " several more months went by before I realized that Stefan had become a Nazi . Oh , I knew lie worked for an officially approved publication , of course , and that he was going along with the current like everyone else ; but that he was the real thing , an actual , active party member , I never could have dreamed . And then came one terrible night when we were invited to dinner at the home of Stefan 's publisher . Do you know who the guest of honor was ? . . . Goebbels . . . . And after dinner he came over and stood smiling at me with that sunken-in , death's-head face of his and told me what a splendid job my husband was doing and how important a man he was sure to become in the new Nazi Ostmark . " " I do n't wonder that you could n't believe it , " Ordway said . " I can hardly believe it myself . " " It seemed impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What did you do ? " " That is the terrible part of it , Martin : I did n't do anything . Days and weeks and finally months went by , and every day I kept telling myself that I was going to do something , but I did n't . I just went on being his wife as if nothing had happened : making a home for him , entertaining his friends , living with him , sleeping with him . Oh my God , do n't you see how it was ? I still lovedio8him , and because I loved him I stayed with him , and soon I was no better than a Nazi myself . " " Nonsense ! You could n't be any more a Nazi than I could . " " No , no , that is n't true . That 's what they all say : I am not a real Nazi . I do n't cremate Jews or rape Polish women . I am innocent of evil . My hands are clean . ' . . . But their hands are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloodier even than Hitler 's and Himmler 's and the rest , who in their perverted minds at least believe in what they are doing , while the rest of us are driven only by self-interest and fear .... This Nazi thing , Martin  --  you can not know it as I do , you have not lived with it and felt it and been poisoned by it . It is not just a thing of politics and government , but of mind and spirit . It is not just what men say and do , but what they are . And those of us who stood by and watched this thing happen , because we were too weak and selfish and cowardly to do otherwise  --  we are the most to blame of all .... " For the first time her voice had risen , and Ordway could feel her hand trembling beneath his own . Now , suddenly she stopped and sat silently for a few moments watching the bubbling current of the little stream . When she resumed speaking it was again quietly and evenly . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not go on like that any longer . I began talking with Stefan , arguing with him , pleading with him . I tried every means I could think of to fight against this thing that had happened to him , to bring us back together again before it was too late . But it was no use . Sometimes he would ignore me and sometimes he would get angry . But most often he would just sit there quietly , blond and handsome and charming as ever , and when I was finished he would smile and say , Das kleine Mutterchen muss sich nicht fiber dieses politisches Zeug plagen . ' And then he would put his arm around me and begin to make love to me . And that was the worst of all . " Then suddenly I did the first thing . Stefan was a Nazi , and , yes , by being his wife I was a Nazi too ; but at least I was not going to bring another damned little Nazi into the world . I was seven months ' pregnant then  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found an old Hungarian midwife who agreed to what I109wanted , and she brought on a premature delivery for me , and the baby was born dead . " Ordway sat staring at the stream . Carla paused another moment and then went on , her voice and face still expressionless . " The baby was born dead and I went home . I went back to Stefan and went on living with him for almost another year . Do n't ask me why , Martin . Do n't ask me anything . I just did , that 's all . I went back home to him , and for ten months I went on pretendingthat things were the same as always , that I was his wife , that I was still alive . The war began  --  first in Poland , then in Norway , Holland , Belgium , France . At first it poked as if Stefan would be called into the army , but then they decided he was too important on the paper and kept him there . It did n't seem to affect me one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything any more . I 'd become like some sort of drug addict , with all the people and things around me blurred and remote and everything that happened to me seeming to be happening to someone else . Months went by like that . .. . " And then at last I did the second thing . " It was one night ii- the snnuncr of 1940  --  a few weeks after France had surrendered  --  and there had been some sort of meeting of the staff of Stefan 's magazine at our house . When the others left , Stefan went up to bed , but I stayed clown in the living room , reading a book . It was almost two when I finished , and I was just getting ready to go upstairs , when I noticed Stcfan 's briefcase lyingon his desk . I remember standing at the door for several minutes , with my hand on the light switch , looking at the briefcase . Then I went over and opened it . " Inside were the papers they had been drawing up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of local people whom the magazine was investigating in connection with a big drive on subversive elements ' in the city . There was a paragraph under each name giving the history of the person and also pencillednotations like Jewish grandparents  --  voted Socialist in 1934  --  receives money from uncle in Milwaukee . I read the list through and recognized many of the names . One or two of them , perhaps , had been politically active at one time or another , but most of them were  --  well  --  just people . There was one of the typesetters on the magazine , the old woman who owned the delicatessen down110the block , a violinist at the Staatsoper who was an old friend of Stefan 's and had been at our house many times . " I stood looking at the papers for a long while . Then I walked over to the fireplace and lit a match and burned them . Even at the time I knew there was no sense to it  --  that there must be many copies of the list  --  but that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by one , and then I took all the other papers from the briefcase and burned them too . When I was finished I went upstairs and got a hat , coat and pocketbook . Stefan half woke up and said , Are n't you coming to bed yet ? ' and I said , Yes , in just a minute , ' and then I went downstairs again and out of the house . " I walked through the streets until it was almost daylight . Then I went to the station and took a train for Innsbruck , and at InnsbruckI got a bus to Feldkirch , on the frontier . I had my papers and an old passport in my pocketbook , and apparently there was no alarm out yet , because I managed to talk my way through . By ten o'clock of that next evening I was in Switzerland . " " And you came right to Kandermatt ? " Ordway asked . Carla shook her head . " Not for over two years . First I went to St. Gallen , where I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waitress at a hotel in Zurich , and after that I was secretary to a lawyer in Berne . . . . But it was still no good , Martin . I could still find no peace . There were Germans everywhere , war everywhere . One evening in Zurich I was waiting on two men in the hotel dining room , and one of them dropped his wallet while he was paying me , and when I picked it up I saw the Gestapo card . Another time I was walking along the street in Berne , and there , not six feet away from me , looking into a shop-window , was a cousinof Stefan 's who is with the consular service . " Finally I could stand it no longer . I wrote a letter to Herr Knubel , asking him if he could give me some sort of work for old time 's sake , and he wrote back telling me to come on , and I came . " That was in the fall of 1942 . I have been here ever since . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her hand beneath Ordway 's , watching the quick silver currents that wove through the little stream . Ordway did not speak either . After a while he released her hand and moved over and put his arm around her and held her gently and close. 111Chapter 7It is like the movies , he thought . It is like being in one of those theatres where they never stop , and Greer Carson is smiling through the tears ; and then Greer Carson is gone and there is the jailbreak or the longhorns stampeding , and then that is gone and there are the angry congressman and the decomposing Japs and the Yakima County Apple Queen and the wolf chasing the **25;1026;TOOLONG the little man coming up out of the floor with his organ ; and then Greer Carson smiling through the tears again , and you reach for your hat . . . . It is like coming out of the theatre into the street and blinking in the daylight , with the movies remote behind you in the cool darkness and no longer real . But the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any minute Greer Carson will come walking around the next corner with Walter Pidgeon and you will step on a decomposing Jap . You have been to the movies and now you are back where you started . This is where I came in , you say . But it is not where you came in , and you are not back where you started . The street is different , and the people walking along it are different , and the sky is a different color , and the sun is in a different place . The hours of the afternoon that went with you into the theatre do not come out with you into the street . You have left them there in the cool , flickering darkness . And you walk a little faster because you are afraid you will be late for dinner . Martin Ordway looked at the girl lying beside him . She layIraquietly with her eyes closed , breathing in long even breaths . Her head , turned toward him , was resting on her out-stretched arm , and her forearm and face were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moss . If her eyes were open , he thought , they would be the same color as the moss . " Carla , " he said softly . She did not move , and he sat for a few minutes watching her . Then he got up and went into the hut . They had left the door open , and as he entered there was a sudden scampering on the stone flagging and the fat marmot ran out past him . He walked slowly around the room again , peering into the cupboard , examiningsome of the carved initials on the table and benches and reading through the old Alpine Club notice on distress signals . Presently he went out again and stood for a while on the steps , looking around him . Carla was still asleep . On the far side of the stream he noticed a narrow path that moved up the mossy slope and disappeared among the boulders beyond . It leads up to the lake , he thought , remembering . He crossed the stream and ascended the path slowly , his hands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pebbles . He rounded an outcropping of gray rock , and the hut and the stream and the girl lying quietly beside the stream were gone . Twelve years were gone . If he turned now he would see a girl of fifteen walking behind him . And a boy with a strong sunbrowned body and curling yellow hair . I can hardly believe it myself , he had said ... . It was what you said when there was nothing to say . When there was everything to say and nothing to say it with . . . . Stefan is a Nazi . . . . Your mother is a whore . . . . The crucifixion was a publicity stunt . . . . The purpose of life is death . I can hardly believe it , you said . It was hollow and fatuous . It was not even true . You could believe it . You could believe anything they told you now , because the field was wide open and everything started from scratch . Not to believe a thing meant that there must be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you had no something-else any more . There was the cool dark of the movie house and the dusty sun on Main Street . There was the little girl with taffy hair and a violin case hurrying to her music lesson , and113there were the decomposing Japs . There was Stefan laughing in the mountains and Stefan composing lists of Jewish grandmothers . One was as believable as the next . As true and real , as untrue and unreal , as the next . Ordway stood still on the path and did a thing that he had done many times in three years of war . He picked up a stone and held it in his hand , looking at it and feeling it . It was small and round and gray and hard and smooth and cold and made of stone ; and that was all it was . It was there . You closed your eyes Thinking about it did not change it by so much as a molecule or an atom , because it was outside thought  --  truer and more real than thought . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things happening ; it was people and things happening to people ; and thinking was what you did about it afterwards , and where the trouble started . He dropped the stone back onto the path . He knew it would make a dull clunking sound as it hit , and it did , and that was real . The pebbles grinding under his shoes and the faint , pleasing tirednessof his legs and the cool air sucking in and out of his lungs were real . The sun , warm on his neck and shoulders , was real . And nothing else , lie told himself . But as he began walking again , slowly , up the path , the girl and boy still walked behind him . And the world through which he moved was not merely a world of rock and sunlight , but a world of thoughts and images , memories and desires . .... There was New York . New York on an October evening . In its own Blue Hour . You were in a bathroom . It was a shining white-tile-and-nickel bathroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partition , and then the cold water coming down , sharp and stunning , and then the big rough Turkish towel . Then you came out of the bathroom , and there were your evening clothes lying on the bed . The old Rogers Peet dinner jacket ; the black silk socks and black batwing tic ; the gleaming white shirt with the amethyst studs your mother had given you for your eighteenth birthday . One of the amethysts was gone  --  you 'd lost it at one of those Christmasparties in thirty-five or six and never replaced it  --  but it didn't114matter , because you always put that stud in the bottom hole , and the vest hid it . You got dressed and went downstairs and got into a cab and called for Carla . Carla would live on Central Park South , high up , so that you could see the yellow headlights curving endlessly through the blue darkness of the park below . She was wearing an evening dress , but it was n't taffeta any more , and her arms and shoulders were soft and cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair shone in the lamplight like dark copper fire . You sat in the window-seattogether and had three martinis . Not two , not four  --  exactly three . Then you went to the Chambord and had oysters Rockefeller and Chateaubriand with sauce Bernaise and cherries Jubilee and sparkling burgundy . Then you went to the Persian Room and danced and to the Stork and danced and to all the other places and danced ( all at no charge , of course ) , and at first everyone watched you dancing and stared admiringly at Carla and wondered who she was , and later everyone went away , and there were only the two of you dancing , and the colored lights in the darkness and an orchestra playing Wienerblut and Night and Day . And you looked down at Carla and smiled and whispered , " This is what we have been waiting for . " But it was not what you had been waiting for . Because even as you spoke , the lights above you in the darkness were changing from soft violet and amber to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a pounding , jerking dissonance of drums and brass . You could see the faces of the musicians now  --  the thick moist lips , the glazed eyes , the twitching shoulders ; the sleek , sharp ferret-faces of the waiters ; the puffy , painted rapacious faces of the other dancers . Moment by moment , the music grew louder , faster . You were pressed close together now in the crowd , and you could feel Carla 's thighs grinding against your own and smell the thick , sweet scent that rose from her hair and breasts . Her slender jewelled hand was like a white bird 's claw on your shoulder ; and now suddenly she raised her face and looked up at you with eyes the color of the weaving spotlights and a red smile carved over her teeth . And then the music stopped . The weaving lights , the weaving dancers , everything stopped . And there was Stefan . He shouldered his way toward you through the dancers , and the dancers were115gone , and then the music and lights and darkness were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stefan standing beside you , very cool and blond and blue-eyed , and saying to her gently : " Bitte , kleines Mutterchen , I shall take you home now . " And then they were gone too  --  everyone and everything was gone  --  and you were walking slowly along an empty street in the windy dawnlight . Your legs felt like lead and there was the taste of lead in your mouth and throat , but you kept on walking and turned a corner into a second street and then another corner into a third street . This street stretched ahead of you , gray and still , as far as you could see . A block or two ahead an old woman in a black shawl was poking in an ash can , and yesterday 's newspapers were swooping fitfully along the gutters in the wind . .... There was New York , and then New Haven , and then Paris and the dusty , sun-splotched ateliers of the Beaux Arts . There was perspective and sciagraphy and 3B Wolff crayons and Professeur Ridabaud and the Boulevard Raspail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was the green countryside and the great gray cathedrals . Rheims , Chartres , Strasbourg , Cologne ; Durham , Wells , Exeter , Salisbury . You had visited almost all the famous cathedrals in those clays , and you had thought a lot about cathedrals . Not that formal religionmeant much to you ; what you were interested in was the expression of the human spirit  --  of a time , a place , a society  --  in terms of stone and space . And when the time for the annual prize competitions came you had submitted a design for an industrial laboratory , because a laboratory , better than anything else , seemed to you to express both the pragmatic and spiritual values of the world in which you lived . It was an ambitious design , and you had worked hard on it and were rather proud of it , and Professeur Ridabaud , who inspected all the drawings before they went up to the judges , had been impressed also . Indeed , he had had but a single criticism to offer . " In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out gently , " it is often considered useful to have stairs . " You did not forget about stairs in the drafting room of Blake and Birdsall on East Forty-fifth Street . You forgot about cathedrals and Temples of Science and a good many other things ; but stairs and storm doors and dumbwaiters and linen closets and rock-woolir6insulation were the very stuff of which your life was made . You worked on Plane Sections A , B and C , while Carrick , on your right , did Elevations F and G , and Matson , over in the corner , did Front Auxiliaries L and M. You finished your blueprints and brought them in to Mr. Birdsall and started them over again and argued with contractors about doorknobs and with carpenters about towel racks and waited and hoped and prayed for the day when you would be assigned a whole house to do on your own . And finally , after two years , you were assigned it . It was a two-car garage for a Mr. and Mrs. Grimback in Garden City , and you sweated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the Lincoln Memorial . But at last it was finished , and there it was ; and it was only another two-car garage , of course , but it was all yours and nobody else 's ( except the Grimbacks ' ) , and you were proud and happy about being an architect for almost the first time since you had forgotten the stairs . You did two or three more garages , a couple of summer cottages at the seashore and a branch office of the Corn Exchange Bank in the East Bronx . You helped Mr. Birdsall and the other senior members of the firm with the detail work of the important jobs . On weekends you flew rented Stinsons and Piper Cubs at a little airport in Westchester . And in between times you fell in love with Joan Nettleton . Afterwards , of course , you tried to convince yourself that it had n't been the real thing  --  that it was only a matterof a delectable body , dark , laughing eyes and a few moonlit nights on the Sound . But it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the first few months after she eloped with that bandleader from Chicago were not months you would greatly care to repeat . And then , in the spring of ' forty-one came the assignment for the workmen 's housing development in Pawtucket . It was no cathedral or Temple of Science , to be sure ; it was just five rows of almost identical frame bungalows in a drained swamp behind a machine-tool factory . But it was the first job you 'd been given that was something you could really get your teeth into , and you got a satisfaction from it that you had not had from any work you had ever done before . You planned and drew and re-drew and watched your plans and drawings become human dwellings . You learned that a six-by-four modern kitchen could hold almost as many knotty problems as a peristyle , and that a backyard play-pen for six Polish kids who had never before played anywhere except117on the city dump was perhaps as satisfying a contribution to the ultimate scheme of things as a well-turned flying buttress . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your work . Joan , flying , everything else you had ever done or cared about , did not matter very much any longer . And then it was a sunny Sunday afternoon in early December , and you were half-dozing on the living-room sofa in the house in Larchmont , and your mother came in and tried to get the Philharmonicon the radio . And suddenly five rows of bungalows in Pawtucket did not matter very much either . .... There was the radio . There were the newspapers and the speeches and the stunned surprise and I-can-hardly-believe-it . There was 90 Church Street and down to Washington and back to 90 Church Street and physical examinations and counting blocks and more physical examinations . There was Upton , Miami , March Field , Kelly Field ... . In the beginning it was wonderful . Partly , of course , it was the newness of everything  --  the learning , the doing , the excitement . But it was also much more than that . For years you had watched the world around you sicken and fester , seen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a great balloon filled with the poison gas of savagery and corruption . You had looked on , with mingled apprehension and shame , while your own country ducked and teetered and sidestepped and danced its hit-parade jig of business-as-usualthrough the wards of the madhouse . You waited .. . And waited . . . . And then at last the balloon burst . The sick , festering bladder split open  --  suddenly , utterly , irrevocably . And you were glad . You hated war , but you were glad . You did not want to kill or be killed , and still you were glad . For it seemed to you that you and your generation were being given an opportunity that had never before been granted to men ; that all the evil of the world had at last been concentrated into tangible , combatable form , and that that form was the form of your enemies . If a man was born onto the earth to fight and die  --  and there was a formidableweight of historical evidence to show that this was exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of fighting and dying than against the monstrous sickness of mind and soul for which Germany and Japan had come to stand before the world ? 118That had been the beginning , and it had had in it the potent magic of all beginnings . It was the magic Michelangelo had captured , once and forever , in his tremendous mural of The Bathers . The Bathers is a battle-scene ; there is no battle in it  --  no blood , no agony , no death  --  and still it is perhaps the greatest battle scene that has ever been painted . " What is the supreme moment of any action ? " Michelangelo had asked himself . " The beginning , of course . " And so it was the beginning of a battle that he had painted  --  a company of Florentine soldiers surprised by the enemy while bathing in a stream . He had caught them in the very instant of their surprise  --  taut , startled , reaching for their arms ; and he had caught , too , the tempest of the spirit that seizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight for their lives . It was men and the spirit of men that mattered to Michelangelo . Not mere struggle and bloodshed ; not mere killing and dying ... . Yes , the beginnings were the great times . But beginnings did not last . You picked up your arms and the fight was on . You went from airfield to airfield and learned your job . You went to England or Italy or New Guinea and did your job . You went out on your missions and came back from your missions and went out again . You dropped your eggs and more eggs and bigger , better , louder eggs . You killed and you died  --  or , if you went on living long enough , a great many things inside you died . It was n't that you did n't try to hold on to what you 'd had at the beginning . You tried like hell . But the war was too big for you . It got away from you . Your world narrowed down to the wing , the group , the squadron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next leave , to the endlessly repeated details of your job . And it was the job , gradually and subtly , that became the most insidious thing of all . It was a necessary job , an important job ; multiplied by a thousand and a million it was the one great job of the world . It was reality , and yet , when you came back to the individual  --  and always , always , always , in war as anywhere else , you came back to the individual  --  it was in a far truer , deeper sense an escape from reality . . . . Flying and dropping eggs and killing a few Krauts  --  that 's all there is , there is n't any more . That was what Ted Riggs had said , and died . That was what a thousand and a million young men like him were saying or thinking , day after day , month after month , year after year , as they went out to die . It was what you said or thought yourself . The war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R.P.M. 's and bombsight readings , of tired- ness and Old Man Percentage and the smell of death ; and the other thing  --  the thing you were fighting for and living for and were willing , if you had to , to die for  --  got lost . Sometimes you thought it was because you were too old ; be- cause you were a tired old man among boys . For the others were boys  --  almost all of them . They were fighters , doers , heroes if you like ; they carried the burden of a world at war ; and still they were boys . Flying and fighting was their job , the same as it was yours , but in their case it was more than a job , because it was the only job they had ever had . It was their life . It was all that they knew . . . You , on the other hand , knew other things ; wanted other things . There were times when what you wanted most of all was never to fly or fight again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as you lived . Still , when you had flown your first fifty missions and had the choice of going home , you had not gone . Many of the others had gone  --  the younger men , the boys  --  but you had stayed . You did not know why  --  but you stayed . You called yourself a fool  --  but you stayed . You went on flying your missions , dropping your eggs , **28;1053;TOOLONG . You flew your fifty-first mission , and your sixty-first , and your ninetieth , and your hundredth . And even now , when fate or luck or Old Man Percentage or whatever it was had knocked you out of it at last , and all you had to do  --  in fact , what you were supposed to do  --  was show your dog tags and spend the rest of the war as an internee-guest at a Swiss resort hotel  --  even now you were sure that in some way , for some reason , that was not what you wanted . Even now you were standing by , unre- solved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion the wheels that would take you back to it again . To fly again ; to fight again . . . . You fight to win  --  period , someone had said . You fight to stay alive . You fight to die . That 's aII there is , there is n't any more . Period . ... There was the sunlight and the rock . The path curved upward among the boulders , twisted back on itself , climbed again , passed between great shouldering shapes of granite and schist and entered a narrow gorge . For perhaps five 12o minutes he threaded his way through a deep twilit corridor betweenperpendicular walls . Then the gorge bent , the walls flared out abruptly , and he came out on the crest of a low , open saddle between two ascending ridges . Martin Ordway stopped and stood still . Directly in front of him , in an irregular rocky bowl beneath the saddle , was a tiny lake the color of purest cobalt . On the far side of the bowl the ground rose again , levelled off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a desolation so vast , so monstrousand absolute , that it seemed no part at all of the green and living earth , but rather the imagined landscape of a long-dead and frozen planet . Stone piled upon stone , slag upon slag , boulder upon boulder , into a gray monotony of distance  --  a still , petrified waste without color or form , without pattern or direction ; a giganticand ancient rubble-bin choked with the detritus of the centuries . Along its central sweep the waste was almost flat . On either side it.tilted suddenly and buckled upward into the bleak shale-slopes and towering cliff-faces of the mountainsides . The mountains , too , were desolate and ravaged  --  scarcely recognizable as the same shapes that rose so pure and gleaming into the sky above the valley of Kandermatt . There was no green of forests or pastures , no sparklingwhite of glaciers . Here , in the hidden inner core of the range , their flanks rose gaunt and skeletal to the precipices , the precipices to the ridges , the ridges to the gray and crumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the summits themselves did not stand out in clear and individual identity . They seemed pressed together , piled chaotically one against the other , in a twisted , warped confusion of aimless masonry . Ordway 's eyes moved slowly over the immense vista of ruin and decay . The waste before him narrowed gradually as it stretched into the distance . The mountain walls on either side slowly converged . It was as if the structure of the earth itself were slowly and inexorably converging , carrying the whole vast tattered fabric of peaks and wasteland with it into one distant ultimate node of sterility and nothingness . And then .. . The mountain walls fell away . The earth appeared almost to be gathering itself together . And leapt upward . What happened then seemed to Ordway to be not so much a phenomenon of form and121substance , to be apprehended by the eye , as a single stupendous crash of music . Naked and gigantic , the White Tower rose out of the earth . Its core sprang up from depths of pressure and dark fire ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land . Range and valley , gorge , rock-slope and wasteland lay sprawled in tilted wreckage around its base . The mountain spilled them aside , steepening and tapering as it soared into the upper air . It climbed higher and still higher , in long , gleaming , sunlit arcs . It rose , ice-sheathed and granite-bowelled , from the dark recesses of the earth into a world of its own above it in the sky . The mountain was made of rock and ice . It was made of glaciers , rock walls , ice walls , buttresses , dykes , precipices , slabs , crags , chimneys , ridges , cols , cornices , crests , spires , domes . It was made of unimaginable billions of whirling molecules of basalt and dunite , diorite and iron ; of ancient , creeping rivers of ice ; of avalanches of rock and snow ; of the spindrift that streamed from its flanks and the lightning that blasted its ridges ; of the cloud and mist that enveloped it and the sun and wind that beat down upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , patient erosion of time . The mountain was all these things , and all these things were the mountain . A substance , a process , a living organism , it built itself up , cell upon cell , detail upon detail , mass upon mass , into its ultimate gigantic whole . But the mountain was more than the sum of its parts . As vast and intricate in structure as a thousand cathedrals piled one upon the other , its essence was not complexity , but simplicity ; not profusion , but oneness . In a single sweeping gesture it climbed from the earth into the sky . As a single mass and form it brooded , still , white and secret , above the valleys and the ranges . Its glaciers rose to its buttresses , its buttresses to its trunk , its trunk to its ridges , its ridges up , up , up , past crag and shoulder , precipice and ice wall , to the last gleaming crown of summit snow . Each merged into the other , became the other , became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain . It was there . An entity . A finality . Rising from the very core of that dead world of rock and air , it seemed to Martin Ordway , as he stared up at it now through the blue miles of space , to possess the finality of death itself . Of life itself ... . He sat on a low , flat boulder with his elbows resting on his122knees , and the girl and the boy were there again , behind him . Then he turned and looked around , and the boy was gone , but Carla was coming toward him along the path that led down from the saddle . She came close and stopped and stood beside him . " I should n't have gone off like that , " he said . " It is all right , Martin . I knew where you had gone . " She was silent a moment , looking at him . " Do you still want to be alone ? " she asked . " No . I 've been alone enough . We 've both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she sat down beside him on the boulder . They sat looking at the tiny blue lake and the waste beyond the lake and the mountain beyond the waste . " What have you been thinking of ? " she asked . " Stefan ? " " A little . " " And of what else ? " " Oh , about Norden bombsights and Michelangelo and 3B Wolff crayons . And oysters Rockefeller and you and myself . " " And about the White Tower , too ? " " Yes , " he said . " About the White Tower too . " They were silent again . He was sitting motionlessly again , looking into the distance with dark , squinting eyes . " Carla  --  " he said presently . " Yes , Martin ? " " Do you remember those Sunday afternoons long ago at old Radcliffe 's ? " She nodded . " And the night at the hut ? " " Yes . " " And the night on the ledge ? " " Yes . " " And have you ever felt  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you still ever want to go  --  to try again ... " He stopped and turned his head and looked at her and was about to go on . But in the same instant he knew there was no need to go on . Her eyes were wide and burning on his face , and her hand , in his , was suddenly tight and warm and gently trembling . " Yes , Martin , " she whispered almost fiercely . " Oh yes  --  yes  --  . yes . " 123Chapter 8Andreas Benner came up the winding road and along the terrace with his slow , bow-legged stride . He crossed to where Ordway was sitting on the verandah steps , took off his green Patrol Corps cap with his right hand , shifted it to his left and shook hands . " Let 's go inside , " Ordway suggested . Benner looked dubious . " It is perhaps better we should stay rut here , " he said . " There 's no one in the lounge . " " It is not that , Ilcrr Mai tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boot nails on the floors . " Ordway grinned . " Still keeping me out of trouble , are n't you ? " IIe got up , and they crossed the terrace to the low stone wall , and as they walked he put his arm around the guide 's broad shoulder and held him tight . " It 's good to see you , " he said . " Do you hear , Andreas ? You do n't know what it means to find something in the world that 's still what it used to be . " " It is good to sec you too , Herr Martin , " said the guide . They sat down on the wall , and he studied the backs of his hands for a moment while he selected the words he was about to speak . " I have made certain inquiries in Interlaken , " he said . " Well ? " " I have spoken yesterday with this certain man there whom I know , and he thinks perhaps something can be done . " 124 " That they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How ? When ? " " How , he does not know yet . Sometimes , he says , it can be done by plane , and sometimes it is by other ways . With France free again it is of course much easier than before . Still , there are many difficulties . " " Did he have any idea how soon  --  " " Such a thing takes time and planning . He thought in ten days perhaps . Or two weeks . " Ten days would give them time , Ordway thought . If Andreas would do it . If he would only do it ... . " You 're to see him again then ? " he asked . The guide shook his head . " For reasons one can understand he does not like people to come to see him too often . There is anotherman with the railroad who goes every day back and forth between Interlaken and Kandermatt . When things are ready he will speak to Christian Mehrwalder , who is a relative of his , and Christian will speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're quite sure all these people can be trusted ? " " You trust me , Herr Martin ? " " I wont even answer that . " " Danke , Herr Martin . Then you can trust them too . " In the silence that followed Ordway studied the square leather brown face of the guide . Suddenly he grinned again . " Andreas Benner , " he said , "  --  Secret Operative No. 42X . " " Witte ? " said Benner . " Just a joke , Andreas . It seems so strange to find you doingwell  --  thissort of thing . " The guide shrugged . " Most of us are doing strange sorts of things these days , are we not , Herr Martin ? " " Yes , I suppose we are . " " And the arrangements so far , they are satisfactory to you ? " " They sound fine . Except that  --  " Ordway hesitated . " Except what ? " " That I 'll never forgive myself if you get into trouble about this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Still it 's possible . " " There is an old saying in the Grisons that the best way not to fall into the crevasse is not to cross the glacier . " " Well ? " " We are already halfway across it , Herr Martin . " Ordway smiled . Then his smile slowly faded and he looked at Benner curiously . " You really want to do this , do n't you ? " he said . The guide nodded . " But why ? Switzerland is neutral . " " One 's country may be neutral . One can not be neutral about one 's friends . " " Then it 's simply as a friend that you 're doing this ? " " As a friend . Of course . " " I mean , it 's not because of any  --  well  --  convictions about the war ? You 'd do the same if I were on the other side ? " Benner looked at him in momentary surprise . Then he considered the questions carefully . " No , I do not think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Because if you were a Nazi you would not be my friend . " Ordway smiled again . " I remember twelve years ago I used to think you were a pretty good diplomat . I 've an idea I was right . " Benner shook his head slowly . " No , Ilerr Martin . I am a good Swiss , I hope , and a good Catholic . Once , perhaps , I was a good guide . And that is all I am . " It was a moment before Ordway spoke again . " You miss your old job , do n't you , Andreas ? " he said : " Twenty-three years I was a guide in Kandermatt . When they take away what a man has been for twenty-three years there is  --  how should I say it  --  an emptiness . " Ordway nodded . " The war makes a lot of emptiness . It 's not what you hear about so much . What you hear about are all the big , loud , angry things . But what you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking out over the still , green valley . " At least Switzerland is luckier than most , " he said . " Belgium , Holland , Czechoslovakia , all the rest . . . " " Ja , " said Benner . " It is luckier than most . And yet  --  " " And yet what ? " " And yet sometimes , Herr Martin , I wonder if we are so lucky . 126If it would not almost be better otherwise . " He shook his head slowly and stared at the ground . " I am not a fighting man and I do not want to kill . No , I do not even want to kill Nazis . But to fight , that is at least a kind of life , and here there is no longer any kind of life at all . It is as if we were on some sort of white frozen island above Europe ; we watch and wait and wait and go on living , but we do not live . The war is all around us , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , but we do not climb them . " There was a short silence . Ordway 's eyes moved slowly up the valley walls to the gray-white world above . " Fraulein Dehn and I were up in the mountains yesterday , " he said . " We visited the Heilweg Hut . " " It is a pleasant walk to the hut , " said Benner . " It was as if it had been only a few months , or even a few weeks , since I 'd last been there . We found your Patrol Corps key and went inside . Then we ate our lunch sitting on the moss by the stream . There was even a fat marmot to watch us . After we 'd eaten Fraulein Dehn fell asleep , and I followed the path up to the lake . " " The lake is very blue this year , " Benner said . " For a few years since you were last here it was slowly turning green . Herr Doktor Radcliffe said it was a kind of microbe that was living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have died or gone away , because now this year it is blue again . " " Yes , it was very blue . And the wasteland beyond it was gray . The mountains were gray too  --  very naked and old-looking , with hardly any snow . Only the Weissturm had any real snow on it , and it was shining in the sun . The Weissturm is beautiful from across the wasteland , Andreas . " " The Weissturm is beautiful from everywhere , Herr Martin . " " It was the first time I had really seen it  --  close up , all of it  --  since I 've been back . I must have sat there for an hour watching it , alone . Then Fraulein Dehn came and we sat watching it together , and suddenly it was as if there had n't been any twelve years at all . Any minute Stefan Raudiger would come walking around the boulders and sit down beside us . And the next minute you would come , and the four of us would sit there among the rocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused and looked at Benner , but the guide did not return127his glance . His eyes remained fixed on the ground , and his motionlessbody seemed almost to be a part of the stone wall on which they sat . " Do you remember all the times we asked you to try it with us ? " Ordway asked . " Ja , IIerr Martin , " said Benner . " I remember . " " And all the times you turned us down ? " Well , this is it , Martin Ordway thought . He drew in a long breath ... . " I 'm going to ask you again , Andreas , " he said quietly . " I know you are , I-Ierr Martin . " Ordway stared at him . " You know ? " he repeated . Benner was looking at the thick , stumpy fingers which he held spread out on his knees . " I know the kind of man you are , " he said . " I know how much you have always wanted this thing . Also  --  " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the other night . " " The other night ? " " When IIerr Knubel and I were carrying you up from the pasture . You had been talking about the war and planes and your friends that were killed , and then all at once you were fighting with us and trying to stand up and swearing . " " I must have been seeing Germans . " " No , " said Benner , " it was not Germans . " " What did I say ? " " There is an American swear word , sonabeech ' ? " " 1Iore or less . " " You said , Just wait , you big white sonabeech  --  we 're going to get you yet . ' " Ordway continued staring at him for another moment . Suddenlylie thought he was going to laugh . But he did n't laugh . Instead , he sat very quietly for a little while , looking out across the wall at the valley and the peaks and the deep blue October sky . " You want this thing too , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . " Do n't you , Andreas ? " The guide nodded . " Ja , Flerr Martin . I want it too . Always since128I can remember I have wanted it more than anything else in my life . " " Then  --  " Benner was still looking meditatively at his hands . " The Weissturm , it is not like other mountains , " he said quietly . " It is a great and terrible thing . " Ordway nodded silently . " Also it is late in the year . Storms and the snow will be coming soon . " Ordway said nothing . " There is little equipment available these clays . The huts are not stocked . The old routes and markers will be wiped out with the years . " The guide raised his head slowly and looked at Ordway . Behindthe brown granite of his face doubt and caution and his inborn peasant conservatism were struggling with the dreams and desires of a lifetime . " It would be a hard and desperate venture , " he said . " All the chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For more than a hundred years now , since there were first mountaineersin the Alps , men have been trying to climb the Weissturm from the valley of Kandermatt . Many of them have been killed . All of them have planned and worked and struggled and frozen and worn themselves out . And all of them have failed . It is almost certain that we would fail too . You know that , IIerr Martin ? Everything would be against our succeeding . Everything . " - He stopped and was silent , wrapped deeply in his thoughts . " Go on , " said Ordway . Benner 's hands were opening and closing slowly against his knees , but he did not speak . " Those are n't the real reasons you 've kept away from the ' Weiss. turm all these years . Or the reasons you 're afraid of it now . There 's something else you have n't told me . " " Ja , Herr Martin , also there is something else . " He hesitated still another moment , and Ordway , sitting beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " My father , Franz Benner , was a guide here in Kandermatt before me , " he said at last . " He was a great guide , and alone of all the guides of that time in the Valais and the Oberland , he believed that the Weissturm could be climbed from this side . Many times. 129he tried it , in the years when I was still a boy . Each time he got a little higher than he had been before  --  higher than any man had ever been on the south and east sides of the mountain  --  but never could he quite get to the top . And then , in the last summer before the first great war , he tried one last time with two English Herren who were famous climbers of that day , and this time he did not come back . " One of the Englishmen they found later on the Dornelgletscher , beneath the south face . The other Englishman and my father they never found . Five , ten , twenty times they searched , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and higher onto the Weissturm they could not and would not go . I was only fifteen then , Herr Martin , but I swore to the Lord and the Virgin , this I will do in my lifetime : I will climb to the top of this beautiful , terrible mountain that has killed my father . " Benner paused , gazing again at his gnarled hands . " Ja , " he went on in a low , even voice , " to climb the Weissturm , that is a thing I have always known I must do before I die . And still I have not climbed it . Thirty years have passed , and I have not climbed it , or even really tried to climb it . Oh yes , I have been on it many times  --  more than any other guide in the Oberland . I have explored , reconnoitred , brought other climbers down , gone higher than any other man , except only my father . But never have I set out to reach the top . Every year for thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will do it . And every year I have found some excuse . The weather is not right . The season is not right . It is not yet the time . " The other guides , they were afraid of the Weissturm . PerhapsI was afraid of it too , but I do not think so . At least it was not of its rock and ice and storms and precipices . And still  --  still I have not gone . It was a thing that I must do and yet could not do . It is not yet the time , I kept thinking , always not yet the time . And so the years went by , and after a while I was no longer so young any more . And then the bad years came , and the second war . And the emptiness . . . " Benner was silent . " And now at last it is the time , is n't it ? " said Ordway . The guide raised his head again and looked at him steadily. 130The eyes , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ja , Herr Martin , " he said very quietly . " Now at last , with God 's grace , it is the time . " Benner 's thoughts moved as his body moved  --  slowly , deliberately , warily . Herr Knubel 's exploded about his tiny office like so many snapping firecrackers . " You will go up by the Aarntal , no ? Or by the Blausee ? . . . Yes , the Blausee is better . Provided it does not snow , the Heilweg and the Blausee are definitely better .... You have all the rope you need , Andreas ? . . . And the axes and crampons ? And tents ? .. . The food will be a bit of a problem , of course . Bread , cheese , meat , tea . I think Rushli , down in the village , still has a few tins of Danish pemmican . . . . Food . What else ? ... Clothes . All yes , clothes for Herr Ordway here . We shall have to think about that . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his little chipmunk 's eyes were sparkling as he looked from Ordway to Benner to Carla Dehn . " It is like the old days , meine Kinder ! " " There is much to be done , " Benner said . " Gewiss , gewiss . And it must be done quickly too . When is it you say you expect word from Interlaken ? " " In ten days . At most two weeks . " " Also , the time is short , no ? One must make allowances for delays , difficulties , storms . Today is what ? Wednesday . You should start up for the hut tomorrow morning . " " Friday morning , " said Benner . " Friday then . At the very latest , " Herr Knubel was struck by a sudden thought . " You can get off all right from the Patrol ? " he asked . " I have two weeks ' leave due . I was going to take them next month for the woodcutting and to bring the goats down from the upper pastures , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for it . " " There 's Fraulein Dehn too , " Ordway put in . " What about Fraulein Dehn ? " asked Herr Knubel . " About her getting off . " The innkeeper waved a reassuring hand . " I was thinking perhaps that Frau Knubel  --  " Carla began . " Frau Knubel is a most admirable and efficient woman , gnadiges : 131Fraulein . But it so happens that I am the proprietor of the Gasthof zum Blauen Himmel . " Herr Knubel permitted himself a glance into the hallway to make certain that his admirable and efficient spouse was not within hearing ; then he slapped an open palm firmly on the desk top . " I say you may go , Fraulein . Therefore you may go . " Ordway bit the smile from his lips . " Thank you , Herr Knubel . " " Thank you , " said Carla . Herr Knubel nodded gallantly . " A pleasure , " he said . Benner had taken a sheet of paper from his pocket and was adding to the list on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over his shoulder . " That 's going to be a hell of a lot to carry , " he said . The guide nodded . Then he checked back over the list and stared meditatively at the point of his pencil . " Too much , Herr Martin . " " You do n't think we can manage it ? " Benner shook his head . " And we ca n't eliminate any of it ? " " We must eat . We must have clothing , tents , equipment . For four years now there has been nothing stored at the huts . " Benner paused and shook his head again . " No , Herr Martin , I have been thinking much about this . For such a mountain as the Weissturm three climbers are not enough . " Ordway was silent a moment . " How many do you think we should have ? " he asked . " Four at the very least . Six would give us the best chance . " " Could you get any of the other guides ? Christian Mehrwalder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' They would not do it . For twenty years there has not been another guide in Kandermatt who would go near the Weissturm . And even if they would , it would not be wise , I think , to let too many people know you are here . " There was another pause . " There 's Doctor Radcliffe , " said Carla . " I had thought of the Herr Doktor , " Benner nodded . " He is no longer a young man , to be sure , but he was once a remarkable climber and he knows the mountains better than many guides . " He turned to Ordway . " What do you think , IIerr Martin ? " 132Ordway considered a moment . " I think yes , " he said . " If he 'll come . " " We can go up and see him this afternoon , " said Carla . Ordway nodded . " There is also Monsieur Dclambre , " Herr Knubel suggested . " And the remaining German . " Ordway looked at him sharply . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday morning . You need not worry , though , that it has something to do with you . Ile was called straight back to Germany . " " Which one is still here ? " " Herr Hein . " " That 's the older , dark-haired one ? " " Yes . " Benner was rubbing his square chin reflectively . " I have seen Monsieur Delambre on a few small climbs behind the Heilweg Hut , and he appeared to be not bad in his technique . Also he has told me that he has made various ascents from Chamonix and in the Engadine , but how good he is on a big mountain I do not know . Herr Hein was , of course , a famous mountaineer before the war ; but I do not imagine , Herr Martin , that you wish very much to climb with a German ? " Ordway did not speak at once , and when he did it was not to answer the question . " You feel that six is the ideal number ? " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . It gives both strength and Biegsamkeit  --  how do you say it ?  --  pliability to a party . There can be two ropes of three or three ropes of two . Also it is best for trying various routes , for making bivouacs , for accidents or storms . " " And you think Dclambre is all right ? " The guide shrugged . " One does not know for certain , of course . " " How about his drinking ? " Ordway looked from Benner to Herr Knubel . " His drinking ? " The innkeeper looked surprised , then shook his head . " I do not know anything about that . Unfortunately , as you know , the Gasthof no longer has a bar . " " He seems to have a pretty impressive supply of his own , though . " 133 " He has some brandy , wines , liqueurs  --  yes , of course . He is a very well-to-do man . But as for drinking  --  no . What gave you that impression , Herr Ordway ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike the taste of five-star cognac , but then who does ? " Ordway paused , thinking back to the afternoon in the lounge . " It was something about his eyes , perhaps . Or his hands . " IIerr Knubel shrugged . Ordway looked at Carla , but she shook her head . " And you , Andreas-you 're willing to take a chance on him ? " " From what I have seen of him , yes . " " All right , " said Ordway . " We 'll ask him . " " And the other , Herr Martin ? " " The German ? " " No , " said Carla suddenly . Her voice was curiously hard and flat . " We do not want the German . . . . Do we , Martin ? " " I do n't know , " he said slowly . " You do n't know ? You do n't mean you would  --  " " I 'm not sure . I have n't thought enough about it yet . " Ordway stared at the floor a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an expert climber , you say ? " The guide nodded . " Of the first rank . " " Meaning we 'd have a good deal better chance if we had him along . " " That would probably be the case , IIerr Martin . " " IIow do you feel about it ? " Benner examined the backs of his hands . " There is the Weissturm , " he said . " There is also the war . " He shrugged his broad shoulders . " It is for you to decide , Herr Martin . " Ordway was silent again , thinking . " We can talk more about it later , " lie said finally . " After we 've seen Radcliffe . " Suddenly he smiled a little . " After all , we do n't even know yet if any of them will want to go . " " Want to go ? " Herr Knubel exclaimed , throwing both hands ceilingward . " Gott im Ilimmel , who would not want to go on such a venture ! " Ordway 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ? " Herr Knubcl looked astonished . Then he looked hurt . Then he sat tugging thoughtfully at his nose . " Ja , Herr Ordway , " 134he said , "  --  most deeply and greatly would I want to go . For almost thirty years now have I lived in Kandermatt , in the shadow of the Weissturm , and all that time I have looked up to it where it stands there in the sky and said to myself , yes , to climb such a mountain would be enough achievement for any man 's lifetime . " He paused and sighed delicately . " But , alas , one 's dreams and ambitions can not always be fulfilled in this world . I am an aging man now . I can not stand heights . I suffer from the arthritis , the diabetes and the insomnia . Also there is the Gasthof : the accounts , the marketing , the maintenance . There are the repairs and the servant problem . There is the wholesale grocer I must see next week and the Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herr Knubel broke off and spread out his hands in a resigned gesture . " You see how it is , Herr Ordway . For some it is the heights and the glory , for others the sweat and toil in the vineyards . " He sighed again ; then abruptly his manner changed and he jumped to his feet . " But we have had enough of philosophy , no ? There is work to be done ! Come , we shall go now over to the storehouse and select the available provisions . " They went through the empty foyer , descended the verandah steps and came out on the terrace . The innkeeper drew in a deep breath of the keen air and gazed meditatively upwards at the glittering rim of the peaks . " Die AIpen , " he murmured . " Die wundcrschonen , weissen Alpen1 " A sudden idea struck him and he clapped his hands together briskly . " Do you know what I shall do ? You remember the telescope that used to be here on the terrace , for watching the climbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set it up again and watch you through it . Across the glaciers and boulderslopes , up the ridges and precipices to the very summit I will follow you . I will be with you every step of the way .... " As they walked across the terrace Herr Knubel 's eyes were sparkling . " Ach , fa , meine Kinder , " he murmured happily , " truly it is like the old days again ! " It was mid-afternoon when Ordway and Carla came down from Radcliffe 's chalet into the bland sunshine of the pastures . Reach-135ing the first stile , they sat side by side on the top step and looked idly out over the valley . " You remember them now , " Carla said . He glanced at her questioningly . " The old songs . You 've been singing them all the way down . " He smiled . " They must have been hiding somewhere . " " Now sing me a new one . " " I do n't know any new ones . " " Yes you do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war song , " he told her . " No . " " This is a very special sort of war song . About the food shortage . " He sang a verse softly and began a second ; then he broke off suddenly and looked at her . " What 's the matter ? " he asked . " Do n't you like it ? " " I do n't understand the words . " He shook his head . " Your English must be very rusty . " " Start again , " she said . " More slowly . " Ile began again . " Mercy  --  is that the first word ? " " No , mairzy . M-a-i-r-z-y . It 's very simple . ... Mairzy doats . " She repeated it . " And then ? " " Dozy doats , obviously . " " And  --  " " Little lambs  --  you know what lambs are ? " " Kleine Dimmer  --  " " Idivy . " She stared at him , frowning . " Clear now ? " he asked . The frown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it is good clear English , " she agreed . " Of course . " " I know some more good clear English too . " " What ? " " Go to hell . " Then they were laughing . They sat on the stile and laughed , and looked into each other 's eyes and laughed , and it suddenly occurred to Martin Ordway that he had not laughed that way in a long time , except after he had been drinking . We are not laugh-136ing at a silly song or joke , he thought . We are laughing because we want to laugh . Because there is laughter inside of us . She was quiet again now , her head half-turned away toward the valley , and he sat looking at her . " Carla , " he said . " Yes ? " " Nothing . I just like to hear myself saying your name again . " She smiled a little , without turning . " It 's going to be all right , is n't it ? " She nodded . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I , " she said . They were silent for a little while ; then she turned and looked at him . " What are you going to do about the others , Martin ? " she asked . " Delambre and Hein ? " " Yes . " " I think Andreas would like to have them , " he said . " Did he say so ? " " Not in so many words . But it 's pretty obvious that he would . " Ordway smiled . " I do n't think a middle-aged geologist , a girl and a half-shot bomber pilot exactly make up Andreas ' idea of a championship climbing team . " " And you  --  do you want them ? " He waited again before answering . " Yes , " he said slowly , " 1think I do . " " Why ? " " Partly for the same reason . As long as we 're going to try it , we may as well give ourselves as good a chance as we can . And then , also  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know exactly how to put it . It seems  --  well  --  to fit in somehow . " " To fit in ? " " With Kandermatt . With you and me and the mountains and everything that 's happened in the last few days . " Carla looked at him intently and seemed about to speak . Them she looked away again at the valley . " You do n't like it , do you ? " he said. 137 " I see no reason not to ask Monsieur Delambre  --  if you and Andreas think he will help . " " But not the German ? " " No . " " Why not ? " " Because he is a German . " Ordway was silent a moment , squinting into the distance . " I wonder , " he said . Carla was watching him again . " I wonder if he is a German  --  here . Are you an Austrian here ? Am I an American ? Or a bomber pilot ? Or an architect ? Are any of us what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I do n't know anything about this Hein . For all I know , he 's a Storm Trooper , a Gestapo agent , a Luftwaffe pilot . Until a few days ago my job in the world was killing his kind , and his job was probably killing mine . In another couple of weeks it will probably be our job again . But here  --  now . . . " Ordway 's eyes moved slowly up the valley walls to the world of rock and ice and sky . " Do you remember what Andreas said this morning ? There is a war . And there is the White ' Power : . . . Do you understand what I am trying to say ? " " Yes , Martin  --  I understand . " " But you still do n't agree ? " It was a moment before Carla answered . " It is for you to decide , " she said quietly . " Without you there would be no climbingof the Tower . There would be  --  nothing . You must do what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . " That 's what my father always used to tell me . But when I did it there was usually hell to pay . " Carla smiled back at him but did not answer ; then she got up and descended the stile . " We had better get back to the inn , " she said . " There are still a hundred things to take care of . " They swung down through the pasture , walking abreast now because the path was wider . The sun fell warm and golden on her arms and checks and danced in a hundred minute flickerings in the soft copper of her hair . . . . He had once known a girl in New York with hair like that , Martin Ordway thought . Her name had been May ( or was it Kay ? ) , and she had been a Powers Girl ( or maybe it was a Conover Girl  --  anyway it was some kind of a138Girl ) , and they had always used her in full-color ads because of her hair . Hair almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite exactly  --  not at all like it , really , he realized suddenly  --  becausethe things that shone in May-or-Kay 's hair had been kleigs and baby spots and the thing that shone in Carla 's was the sun . He thought about Carla 's hair in the weaving purple-orange of a New York night ; under a Madison Avenue hat ; against the cool , sweet whiteness of a pillow-slip .... This is a hell of a time to be thinking about pillow-slips , he told himself . Without even a sleeping bag or proper blanket roll in the whole damn valley . Well , at least it was lucky that Radcliffe had a supply of good Scotch-wool blankets . It was lucky that Radcliffe was around at all . . . . And then he was suddenly puzzled again , thinking about Radcliffe . About the way he had stood there in his little garden , listening , smiling .. . " You are worrying about something , " Carla said . " Not worrying . Just thinking . " " About Herr Hein ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry we asked him to come ? " " No . I 'm just curious  --  " The Englishman had been squatting over his autumn vegetable patch as they came through the gate , and as he got to his feet to greet them it was like some sort of long , articulated yardstick unfolding joint by joint . He had stood silently leaning on a rake and listening while Ordway spoke , and presently , a slow , deep smile had come into his beaked face and sharp blue eyes . And when Ordway had finished he had shown neither surprise nor hesitation , nor even asked so much as a single question . He had merely nodded and said quietly , " Yes , old boy , I should like very much to come . " " It seemed almost that he knew in advance what I was going to ask him , " Ordway said . Carla nodded a little . " Yes , " she said . " He knew . " " But how  --  " " Andreas knew too , before you asked him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " And I knew . " He was silent , watching her face. 139 " I do n't know how to explain it , Martin , " . she said . " It was as if  --  well , almost as if all of us up here in the valley were waiting for something . Doctor Radcliffe , Andreas , Herr Knubel . Even the others  --  " " You mean Delambre and Hein ? " " Yes , even they , I think . " " Did you ever talk about climbing the Tower ? " She shook her head . " No . You can not live in Kandermatt , of course , without thinking about the Tower  --  without feeling the Tower . But no one ever talked about it . None of us were actually thinking about climbing it . Any more than we were thinking that one night you would come floating down into the valley out of the sky . And yet  --  " " Go on , " he said . She hesitated a moment longer , and when she spoke again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you a funny thing , Martin ? That night you came down I was lying awake in my room , and suddenly I heard footsteps on the verandah and then Andreas calling Herr Knubcl and telling him about a parachutist lying out in the pasture . After a few minutes they went out , and I lay there until I heard them coming back , and then I got up to see if there was anything I could do to help . I put on my bathrobe and slippers and was coming down the stairs when I heard them crossing the verandah and opening the door . I could not see you yet , but suddenly something had begun happening inside of me . My heart was pounding so hard I had to stop walking and stand quite still , holding the bannister . " " You mean you knew it was I ? " " No , I do not think I knew that . And yet I knew something . That something was happening . Or was about to happen . I had felt like that only once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing in our house in Vienna , after Stefan had gone up to bed , and I sat there alone in the living room staring at his briefcase on the desk . " She paused again and then continued . " I stood there on the steps , waiting , while they brought you in and laid you on the couch in the foyer ; but I still could not see your face . My heart was pound- ing so hard I could scarcely breathe , and I wanted to run away , so that I would not have to see who it was . I was afraid to know , 14o and still I had to know . And then , the next minute , I was walking downstairs again . I came over to the couch and looked at you , and suddenly the pounding was gone , and I was standing there , very calm and quiet , and thinking , Yes , of course  --  it is he . " Ordway started to speak , stopped himself , and walked silently along with his eyes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carla said . " Those times on the terrace , and then yesterday , walking up to the hut . You were back , and I was happy that you were back , and at the same time I was afraid . That was why I was avoiding you . " " I 'd imagined it was because of Stefan . Because you did n't want to tell me about him . " " Yes , it was Stefan too . " She was looking up at him now , and her voice was suddenly very low . " Oh , do n't you see , Martin ? It is all the same thing . Stefan , the baby , the war , everything . For two years I have been hiding from them , shutting them out of my mind and my life . There is nothing beyond these mountains , I have said to myself  --  nothing but more mountains . There is no past , no future . There is only Kandermatt and the forests and the snowpeaks . There is only the Gasthof and beds to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing . Nothing . " And then you came . You were lying there so quiet on the couch in the foyer with your parachute on the floor beside you . We were standing together on the terrace , walking along the forest paths , sitting on the moss beside the stream at the Heilweg Hut . And I was happy that you were back again  --  oh so very happy , Martin , believe me  --  and at the same time I was afraid , because everything I had built for myself during these last years was slippingaway from me . I had promised myself I would not go with you up to the hut . But I did . And then , lying there by the stream , when you got up and went into the hut  --  " " I thought you were asleep , " Ordway said . " No , I was not asleep . I heard you going into the hut , and then coming out again and starting up the path , and without opening my eyes I knew where you were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart pounding again the way it did that first night when they brought you in , and I knew that if I got up and followed you it would all be finished . Everything I had struggled and prayed for through those years  --  forgetfulness and peace of mind and sanctu-141ary  --  all of it would be finished , gone forever . I will not go , I kept telling myself . I will not , will not go . And then I got up and I went . I came up through the gorge , and out on the other side , and there you were by the lake , where I knew you would be . You were looking across the wasteland at the Weissturm , as I knew you would be doing . And then , when I sat down beside you , you said what I knew you were going to say . And all at once it was again the same as on that first night ; my heart had stopped pounding , and I felt very calm and quiet , and I sat there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb it . " Her voice , as they walked along , had remained low and even . But now abruptly , as she spoke the last words , it broke , and she stopped and stood quite still on the path . Her back was turned to Ordway and her hands were pressed to her face . " Carla , " he said . She neither moved nor spoke , and he put his hands on her shoulders and turned her around . For a moment her shoulders were stiff and tense under his touch ; then they began to tremble , and a low , broken sob rose from deep inside her . With her hands still covering her face , she leaned suddenly against him . " Hold me a minute , " she whispered . IIe folded his arms around her and held her gently and tenderly- " Not like a little girl , " she said . " Like a woman . " IIe drew her closer and held her tight . IIe felt her hair against his face and her head pressed against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and legs and all of her soft , slender body pressed trembling and sobbing against his own . Then her hands were no longer over her face , but around his neck , and her face was no longer hidden , but raised to his , and he was kissing it , tasting the bitter salt of her tears and the sweetness beneath the tears , and feeling her clinging to him , body and mouth and tears and sobs all clinging to him , sweet and close and fierce . And then , in the next instant , she was no longer clinging to him , but breakingaway . She had broken away and was standing again with her back to him , her hands over her face and her shoulders tight with her sobs . He waited silently and without moving until her sobbing began to subside ; then he put his arms around her waist and held her lightly from behind . She neither responded to his touch nor movedaway , and they stood quietly while her crying lessened and at last stopped altogether . " Turn around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He swung her gently about , so that she faced him , but she would not look at him . " I am so sorry , " she said . " No . " " I am so ashamed . " " No . " She was silent for a few moments . Then she said , " Give me a handkerchief , please . " " That 's better , " he said . He fished a handkerchief from his pocket , handed it to her and waited while she dabbed it at her nose and eyes . " Flow do I look ? " she asked when she had finished . " Like hell . " " Everyone will know I have been crying . " " We 'll explain that I 've been beating you . " " Buy  --  " " Ent nothing , " he said . They followed the path down through the meadows and into the forests beside the rumbling Aarn . Coming to one of the little streams that fed it , he steadied her across the stepping stones , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand . Presently the path twisted up a steep timbered slope and they came out on the bald knob of rock where he had sat , alone in the mist , on his first evening in Kandermatt . But there was no mist now . Valley and valley-wall , forests , glaciers and mountains stood up clear and immaculate in the golden sunlight . Far above and beyond the other peaks the summit of the ' White Tower hung still and gleaming in the October sky . " Afraid of it ? " he asked . " A little . " " But not sorry ? " She did not answer . " Are you sorry I 've come back , Carla ? " " No , " she said quietly . " And that we 're going to climb the Tower ? " 142 143 " No . " " And that we need each other ? " " No , Martin . " They descended the far side of the knob , and the valley-walls and mountains swung slowly out of view behind the interlacing treetops . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll both sing . " " But we do n't know the same songs . " " There 's one we both know . " " Which is that ? " " Mairzy Doats , " he said . And they sang . Chapter 9On the stone flagging of Herr Knubel 's storeroom supplies and equipment accumulated in sprawling , serried piles . Martin Ordway prowled restlessly among them , checking and sorting . " The crampons , " he said suddenly . " There are only three pairs of crampons . " Carla rustled through her lists . " Andreas has only three pairs , I-le is borrowing the others from Anton Kronig . " " And the evaporated milk  --  " " Frau Knubel keeps it in the kitchen cupboard . Annamarie is bringing it down . " " We hope . " There were the crampons , the ice axes , the pitons , pitonhammersand karabiners . There were the great yellow coils of rope . There were tents , groundcloths , rucksacks , packboards , boots , espadrilles , Balaclava helmets , mittens , flashlights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knives , eating utensils , canteens , a fireless cooker and two Primus stoves . There were tea , coffee , sugar , bread , sausage , cheese , chocolate , and tins of meat , margarineand fruit . " Seems to me there 's only one thing missing , " Ordway said at last . " What ? " asked Carla . " The three-ton truck to carry it . " 145Andreas Benner trudged back and forth along the road between the inn and his farm , transporting the contents of his attic to the stacks on the storeroom floor . Between trips he went down to the village to arrange his leave at Patrol Corps Headquarters and to borrow extra clothing and climbing equipment from his fellowguides . " Was gibes ? " they asked , their eyes narrowing curiously . " Only a little trip to the glaciers , " he explained . " With whom ? " " With Herr Delambre . You know  --  the Franzose at the Gasthof . " " And you need all these things for a little glacier trip ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of everything . " The others smiled wisely . " For a good payment , eh ? " " Jawohl , " he agreed . " For an excellent payment . " At first he had tried to tell the same story to his wife , but with her it had not worked . " It is that American , too , is n't it ? " she said. " fa , " lie conceded , " tile American too . " " I have told you  --  you will get in trouble with that American . " " No , I shall not get in trouble . " " how much are they paying you ? " Benner hesitated . " They are paying the regular forty francs a day ? " " Yes , the regular forty francs . " She stared at him a moment , and her lips grew tight . " How much are they paying you , Andreas ? " Benner drew in a deep breath . " Nothing , " he said . In the beginning she had shouted at him . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak at all . Then she shook her head grimly and muttered , " I am the wife of a lunatic . " But when the time came for him to leave , there was his old rucksack neatly packed with his extra shirt and socks and Kletterschuhe and pipe tobacco , and , in his buttonhole , the blue cornflower that she had put there each time in nineteen years that he had started off for the mountains . " Be careful , " she said , as she came with him into the dooryard . " Be careful and say your prayers each morning and evening and do not climb on Sunday , and you will get to the top . " 146He looked at her in surprise . " But we are going only to the  --  " " I know where you are going , " she said . " But  --  " " Go on now . Your other crazy ones are waiting for you . " She kissed him quickly on the cheek and gave him a push down the path . " Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much about this verdammte mountain of yours and a little more about the vegetables and the goats . " Back in the storeroom at the inn he set to work sorting the equipment and loading the rucksacks and packboards , but every so often his eyes wandered to the little blue cornflower on the old belted jacket that he had hung on a nail in the wall , and he shook his head in slow puzzlement . If a man could not understand a woman after nineteen years , Andreas Benner wondered , when was he going to start ? On the first day of their preparations they worked through until after midnight , and the next morning they began with the sunrise . Herr Knubel shuttled briskly between storeroom and kitchen , laden with foodstuffs and suggestions . Ordway and Benner finished the loading of the first two packboards , tried them out on a tenminutewalk down the road and came back to reload them . Towardnoon Nicholas Radcliffe appeared in a cart with his climbing gear , his flute and a stack of blankets , and Carla and Frau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls . Delambre brought a variety of jars and tins down from his room to augment the food supply and , as an afterthought , added two bottles of Courvoisier . " One for medicinal purposes , " he explained . " And one for celebrationwhen we reach the top . " " And if we do n't reach it ? " Ordway asked . " Then for consolation . " It had been after dinner the previous night that Ordway had spoken to him about the climb , and the Frenchman , like Benner and Radcliffe before him , had seemed almost to know in advance what it was that he was going to ask him . He had been neither doubtful and hesitant , however , like the guide , nor calmly acquiescent , like the Englishman . Instead , he had sat motionless and tense while Ordway told him briefly of their plans , his knuckles white against his chair-arm and his eyes seeming to grow slowly147darker and brighter behind the heavy lenses of his glasses ; and when Ordway had finished he had risen slowly to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall never be able to express my gratitude for this , " he said . Ordway smiled slightly . " I do n't know that it 's anything to be grateful for . We 're certain to have a rough time of it . And we 'll probably fail . " " Nevertheless , Monsieur Ordway  --  " " You 'd like to come then ? " " Yes . Yes . " Delambre 's long , slender hand reached out and grasped Ordway 's tightly ; then he turned abruptly away . " I can not tell you what this means to me , " he said , his voice curiously thick and muffled . Later , when Ordway told Carla about it , she had nodded quietly and without surprise . " And the other ? " she asked . " I kin ? " " Yes . Have you asked him ? " IIe shook his head . " Are n't you going to ? " " I do n't know . " IIe had seen the German in the ( lining room at dinner and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had merely nodded to him as he came and went . Toward mid-morning , when he finally decided to speak to him , lie had not been able to find him anywhere about the inn . Then Radcliffe had appeared with his blankets , there had been a minor crisis about boots that did not fit and another about punctured meat tins , and in the resultingactivity lie dismissed the matter from his mind . After lunch he , Radcliffe and Benner sat with paper and pencil at a table on the verandah , working out the schedule for the next few days . Their food and equipment , after all possible eliminations and the most careful distribution , still required five packing boards , three large rucksacks and four small ones , and it was therefore obvious that they would have to make at least two trips up to the Heilweg Hut before everything could be assembled there . " Can we do it in a day ? " Ordway asked . " It is possible , " said Andreas . " But I think it is perhaps better we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must carry , and 148for Herr Delambre and yourself , who have not climbed so much recently  --  " Ordway grinned wryly . To the Heilweg  --  two days , he wrote . From the Heilweg Hut their route would run through the gorge to the saddle between the Himmelshorn and the Karlsberg ; then down to the Blausee and across the miles of the wasteland to a second , long-abandoned hut near the snout of the Dornel Glacier . " You remember it , I-Ierr Martin ? " Benner asked . " From the time when  --  " Ordway nodded . " We 'll have to make a couple of trips there too , " said Radcliffe . " That will take two days , surely . " " Ja , it is a long way , " the guide agreed . Valley to glacier , Ordway wrote . Four days . Radcliffe unrolled a 1/50,000-scale Geographic Society map that he had brought with him and marked the approximate location of the Dornel hut with his pencil . Then he slowly traced their course up the white avenue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southerly precipices . " I imagine we 're all agreed that the southeast ridge is our best bet ? " he asked . Ordway looked at Benner . " Ja , " said the guide . " For a beginning , at any rate . Later  --  " he shrugged , "  --  who can tell ? " The Englishman nodded , and the point of his pencil crept onwardacross the ever-thickening lines of the altitude contours . " From here on , of course , " he said , " maps wo n't be of much use . The ' details have been filled in mostly by aerial survey and triangulation , but there are one or two features that  --  " The voice went on . The pencil moved on . Martin Ordway 's head was bent intently over the map between Benner 's and Radcliffe 's . But as he looked now , the intricate pattern of lines , dots and shadings seemed slowly and subtly to be rearranging itself under his eyes . It was no longer glaciers and buttresses , ridges and precipices that rose toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , factory sheds , docks , railway sidings . The black point of graphite moved slowly on over Lille , Aachen , Cologne , Essen ... . Clear now , boys ? he was asking. 149Yes , sir . Any questions ? Do we come in from the west or northwest ? ( That was Harry ) The northwest , dope . ( Bix ) Bearing three-fifteen . ( Ted ) Okay , then . The pencil had stopped moving at last . It had crept on beyond the innermost of the wavering concentric ellipses and was pointing to a minute blue-inked X. Then quickly it ringed the X with a black circle . " Target , " said Ordway . A few moments passed before he realized that Radcliffe and Benner had raised their heads and were looking at him curiously . The Delambres , husband and wife , were in their room on the second floor . Paul Dclambre was moving back and forth between the closet and the chiffonier , selecting articles of clothing which he then laid in neat geometric rows on the bed . His wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knitting . She was wearing a plumcoloredhouse-coat that , like most of her clothes , was cut low at the throat and shoulders and clung closely to the full curves of her body . The late afternoon sunlight , sloping into the room between the net curtains , danced and glittered in the rich golden coils of her hair . Delambre brought a pair of nailed boots from the closet , placed them on the floor and stood looking at the clothing on the bed . There were two thick woolen shirts and one flannel one , a pair of heavy corduroy trousers , a waterproof jacket , three sweaters , long woolen underwear , woolen socks , mittens . Presently he took off the gabardine slacks and soft sport shirt he was wearing and put on one of the wool shirts and the corduroy trousers . Crossing to the mirror , he stood looking at his reflection for a moment then he stretched slowly and flexed his arms and shoulders . The feel of the rough fabric caused a warm , pleasant glow to spread through his body . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognac . Yes , he thought , there were times when a man needed such things . Rough wool and canvas ; leather and steel . " Have you seen that old pigskin belt of mine ? " he asked 15o " It may be in the trunk , " his wife said , without looking up. , " The sun is in my eyes . Will you pull the shade , please ? " He crossed to the window and pulled the shade halfway down . Then he turned and leaned back against the sill , watching the swift play of her needles . " Astrid  --  " he said . Her deep violet eyes looked up at him incuriously . " We may be gone almost two weeks , you know . " She nodded . " You do n't mind ? " " Why should I mind ? " she asked . " You seem a little -- well  --  resentful . " " I am not resentful . I just do n't understand it . It seems such a strange notion . " Delambre winced at the word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said patiently . " Whatever you want to call it then . " Madame Delambre had continued knitting as they spoke . For a few moments now the only sound in the room was the thin , measured clicking of her needles . " You do not understand , ma petite , " Delambre said quietly . " To climb this mountain , this monstrous and beautiful Tour Blanche  --  it is a thing that I want to do most terribly . Ever since we came to this valley , from that first morning when we drove up along the road from the village and I saw it there white and shining in the sky , I have wanted to climb it . I have known that I must climb it . " " Before this you have always been saying the one thing you wanted was to write your book . " A shadow crossed the Frenchman 's face . " Yes , there is the book too , " he said . " You are still planning to write it , then ? " " Of course I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that now for almost four years . " Delambre 's long fingers closed slowly into fists , and his eyes , behind the lenses of his glasses , seemed to grow larger and darker . " Yes , and I shall go on saying it . And I shall do it , " he said , his voice suddenly strained and a little shrill . " Nom de dieu , what is it that you expect of a man ? That he create literature or philosophywhile the world explodes around him ? Or sitting here , year151after year in a forgotten little pocket of the earth , like a stone , a stick of wood , a vegetable ? Can you not see what I am talking about ? What I am trying to do ? I must feel again , fight again , come alive again . . . . " " And you think you will come alive again , as you call it , by breaking your neck on a mountain ? " As he talked , Delambre had risen from the window sill and begun pacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared across the room at his wife . " Yes , precisely , " he said . " By breaking my neck . By standing on my hands on the edge of precipices . By spattering my brains over the rocks below . " " It is useless for us to talk if you will not talk sense , " his wife said placidly . " It is useless for us to talk  --  ever . " He sat down on the edge of the bed and gazed out the window at the strip of forest and pastureland that showed between the shade and the sill . It was silent again in the room , except for the tiny clicking of the needles . " It is because of this American , is n't it ? " Madame Delambre said presently . " What is ? " " That you arc going to the mountain . " " Partly . " " It was he who asked you , was n't it ? " " Yes . " " And lie suggested that you might pay for it , perhaps ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expenses , no ? The guide , food , whatever else it is you take on mountains . " " Perhaps . I do n't know . " Delambre shrugged in annoyance . " You see how it is , " be said , " we can not talk together . We can not think together . I try to speak to you of the things that are inside of me  --  of real things , important things  --  and all you are thinking of is the money . " " Many people think that money is important . " He was about to speak angrily again , but stopped himself . No , he thought , it was senseless to become upset about such things . It was senseless , after so many years , to go on expecting the impossible. 152 " I have been watching this young American , " he said presently . " I think he is in love with the Austrian girl . " " I do n't know anything about that . What I mean is that I have been studying the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you remember what I was saying to you the other night ? That he was strong , integrated , a doer . Well , I was right , you see . How long has he been here ? Three clays ? Four ? Yet in that time more things have happened in this valley than in months and years before . The rest of us , we sit and stare up through the blue miles at the Tour Blanche and dream that some clay , perhaps , we shall climb it . Then this American comes , and we set out to climb it . " Ile paused again , looking thoughtfully out the window . " Do you know what I have been thinking ? I have been thinking that after the war I should like to go to America . " " Go there ? " His wife looked up at him , but the soft clicking of the needles continued . " Yes  --  why not ? Why do you say it in that tone ? " " America is a long way off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to France , and you have not even been willing to do that . " " France ! " Delambre made an impatient gesture with his long hands . " What is there left for us in France ? Or anywhere in Europe ? . . . America may be big , raw , turbulent ; but it is alive . France may be free again , but it is still dying . Europe is dying . Its young men put on their uniforms . Faceless , nameless , mindless , they crowd into their phalanxes and battalions and march off to kill and die . Those who remain have become either brutalizedthugs or bloodless , impotent intellectuals . And what is left for us ? Hunger , perhaps , and beyond it nothingness . A few piddlingappetites and fears , and beyond them nothingness . Our cities are the shattered mausoleums of dead cultures . Our churches and libraries are the skeletons of dead faiths . Nothing is left  --  nothing . " Delambre rose and crossed again to the window . Raising the shade , he sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kandermatt . . . . It is all bloodless , rootless , seedless , he thought . Even the green sweetness of the fields has become the sweetness of the stench of death . Even the mountains , risinn cold153and gleaming out of the dead heart of Europe , are like heaps of whitened bones . It was very still now in the room . The knitting needles clicked . Paul Dclambre looked down the long green valley into the distance ; into the past .. . In everyone 's memory of his own life there is a node , a starting point  --  a sure and always rediscoverable landmark in the blurred wilderness of time . For some it may be a mother 's caress , a new toy , a certain day in school ; for others a train trip , a party , a boat on a lake , a laughing girl . For him it was , simply and unalterably , a room . His fourth-floor-rear room in his parents ' home on the Rue.Castellane in Paris . Of his parents themselves and the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner of the industrial banking firm of Delambre Freres , existed in his memory only as pince-nez and a voice ; his mother only as clothes ; the house as an immense , vague labyrinth of chandeliers and Empire furniture , peopled by day with dusting servants and by night with gleaming shirtfronts and jewelled gowns . But his own room was real , vividly , unfadingly real  --  as much a part of him still as his clothing , his voice , his very body . In the beginning it had been his oldest brother Charles ' room , and later , for a year his second brother Marius ' . But Charles had gone away to war in 1914 and never come back , and Marius had gone off to school in 1915 , and thereafterit had been his , his only , his completely . The mere thought of it moved him almost to tears . The long secret hours he had spent there ; the enchanted sun-flecked afternoons ; the dark soundless nights when he turned on the carefully screened bed-lamp and read and read , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly because of the mystery and wonder of what he was reading and partly because it seemed to him that that tiny secret light beside him was not just the only light burning in all that great dark silent house , but the only one burning in all Paris , in all the world . He had not counted the months and years by the war or peace , or even by schools or vacation trips or his growing body or the clothes he wore , but only by the books he read . First Hugo , Scott , Dickens , Stendhal . Then Shakespeare , Coethe , Balzac , Voltaire . Then Baudelaire , Byron , Rimbaud , Wedekind . The list was as endless154as his appetite was insatiable . And slowly , magically , year by year , the walls of that little room had seemed to expand around him , until all the wisdom and sorrow , all the beauty and terror of the world were contained for him , indissolubly , within its prosaic , familiar confines . Yes , terror had been there too , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in the sunlight and shadows ; in the soft , crowding darkness beyond the circumference of the yellow night-light . But most of all it dwelt in the mirror that rose smooth and faintly gleaming from the top of the old walnut chiffonier . Hour after hour , during those years of boyhood and adolescence , he would stand motionless before it , staring and wondering , trying to find in its still silver depths the key to the mysteries of flesh and spirit that were tormenting him . It was himself at which he was looking , of course , and yet , in a profound and subtle way it was not himself  --  or it was more than himself . For always , as he watched , the image in the glass would begin to take on a strange and indefinable depth  --  a thickness , almost  --  and from behind the familiar face and features there would emerge slowly another image , another thing , that was not he at all . And he would stand rooted , scarcely breathing , while this inwardness moved silently forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass  --  hostile , alien , unreal , and yet at the same time far more real than reality  --  until suddenly terror would mount through him in a slow , icy wave , ; and he would tear himself away at last and throw himself face downward on the bed , spent and trembling . Later , when he was a man , he learned that it was an experience that came to many children , in one form or another , at the beginning of self-awareness . But in his own case it was an experience that was never to be outgrown . On the contrary , as he grew older it became ever more frequent and more intense , until the actual physical world itself slowly began to take on for him many of the elusive and ambiguous qualities of a mirror . A face , a landscape , a painting , the body of a woman  --  even the commonest objects of daily use  --  would often appear to him , as he contemplated them , to be somehow changing , dissolving , disintegrating before his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its place was the depth , the shadow , the inwardness , that it contained . he would stare , motionless and entranced , realizing with part of his155mind that it was mere hallucination , but at the same time knowingthat in some arcane and half-comprehended fashion he was penetrating to the reality behind the image , the substance within the form . And with it always , mounting , spreading , the still , cold wave of fear ... . At fifteen he left home for the first time , for three years at an aristocratic school for rich men 's sons in the pleasant Loire countrysidenear Blois . He neither liked nor disliked it , neither profited nor suffered from the experience . He moved physically in a different world , spoke different words , saw different sights , but his real life went on almost unchanged from that which he had known in the quiet secret room of his boyhood , plunging ever deeper into the multiform and inexhaustible world of the mind and the imagination . There were times when he was lonely . There were times when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonelinessand fear was pride , for he knew already that he could say with Descartes , " lc pcnsc , done je suis , " and with Verlaine , ' jai plus do souvenirs que si j'avais niille ans . " Then came the university years : two at the Sorbonne , one each at Cambridge , Gottingen and Bologna . IIe did not follow prescribedcourses of study or take degrees , but browsed eclectically through the treasure bins of history , taking from each such gold as it seemed to him it had to offer . T1'hcre were periods when he worked with immense and feverish concentration , burning with the resolve to be another Aristotle , Leonardo or Goethe and encompasswithin himself the very sum-total of human wisdom and experience . There were others when his energies were scattered and diffused , when all the springs of thought and effort seemed to have dried up within him , and he seemed capable only of perceptionand sensation  --  nothing more . These were the years in which music , painting , sculpture and architecture became a part of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their antiquity , their loveliness , their poignant and piercing sadness . These were the years , too , of his first knowledge of women . His earliest affair was with a barmaid in a Cambridge pub , his second with the daughter of a history professor at Gottingen , his third with a ' cafe dancer in Munich . To all of them , and the others that followed , he came with a curious anguished mixture of desire and fear , and all of them left him shaken and dissatisfied . It was not156that he fell in love . He was too deeply involved with his own thoughts and emotions ever to lose himself so completely in another . But always he was conscious in the end of frustration ; of something promised , hinted at , and then left unrealized . Always , as in his solitary vigils before his mirror , there seemed to be another image behind the visible image , an inwardness behind the reality , a hidden essence of mystery , unknowablcness and nameless terror . One night in a hotel in Milan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scala , an exquisite and delicate girl with the features of a half-grown madonna , when , in the very act of coitus , a beam of light fell through the window onto her face and it seemed to him that it was contorted with lust into the semblance of a fleshless death 's head . Trembling and sweating , he snatched up his clothes and ran out into the night ; and for months thereafterhe fought down his recurring desire and lived a life of continenceand troubled dreams . By the time he returned to Paris to live his father had died and his mother had remarried . He paid her a single , almost laughably formal visit at her new home , and another , equally meaningless , to his brother Marius in the gilt-and-mahogany offices of Delambre Freres . Then he shut himself away in two tiny sequestered rooms overlooking the Quai Voltaire and launched at last into the sustainedcreative writing which he had known since boyhood was to be his true life 's work . For three years then he lived what was almost the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left him a sizable fortune , on the income of which he could have moved in the most fashionable and exclusive circles of the city ; but he cared nothing about such things . His money he spent on his painstakingly chosen and ever growing collection of paintings , sculptures and records , and his time he spent on his work . By the end of the first year he had sold an essay on Rimbaud and another on Mallarme to two of the more experimental literary magazines , and six months later he brought out a slim morocco-bound volume of his poems in a privately printed edition . The poems did not cause the stir that he had hoped ; indeed they went quite unnoticed . But it did not matter to him , really . All that mattered was his long philosophical novel , L'Ame Qui Rie , which was his major task and into which he was pouring the distillation of all157his years of living , thinking and feeling . He went on working at it , unruffled and serene . Toward the end of the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a period of stagnation . Somewhere along the line he had begun to bog down in the subtleties and tortuosities of his own thought . " The world has receded too far from me , " he told himself , " I have lost it and I must get it back . " Gradually forsakinghis ingrown hermetic life , he began to mingle in the artistic and intellectual life of the city , attending the openings at the theatres and galleries , devoting more time to his collections , and moving on the fringes of that glittering and frenetic coterie of cosmopolitans whose vortex was the ateliers of Cocteau and Maritain , Picasso and Gertrude Stein . He developed an interest in several young writers and artists of talent and found satisfaction in assisting them over their financial difficulties . He helped sponsor a string quartet and an intimate gallery in which only cubist and abstractionist painters would be hung . For eighteen months he was backer and co-editor of a highly regarded , but unfortunately never popular , literary and artistic revue called Approches Nouvclles . Meanwhile lie planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still its progress did not satisfy him , and still he could not seem to recapture thc first fine concentration and consecration with which he had begun it . I have not yet found what I am searching for , he thought . This tight , self-absorbed little cosmos of artists and intellectuals is no more the real world than my solitary rooms above the Quai Voltaire . If I do not wish to atrophy altogether I must get away from it and stay away .... And he began to travel . Spending only two or three months of each year in Paris , lie set out on one journey after another to all the places , near and remote , toward which imagination had beckoned him since early boyhood : to Scandinavia , Lapland and the empty northern tundras ; to Algiers , Cairo and Damascus in the scented , swarming south ; to the Nile and the Tigris , the Caucasus and the Himalayas , the hot , murmurous cities of old Asia and the soft , shining islands in the sea . Occasionally during his journeyings he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not even try , for it was no longer writing , or even thinking , about the world that mattered to him , but simply the world itself . Moving from158land to land and continent to continent , he steeped himself in its variousness , its distances , its vast and encompassing anonymity . It was in Sweden , at an obscure summer resort on the silver Baltic beaches , that he had met Astrid Varnholm . She was one of the three waitresses at the tiny seaside inn at which he stayed , and he had not been there more than a day or two before he was aware of an attraction , almost a compulsion , toward her that he had never before experienced toward any woman . In the years since his university days his few sexual relationships had been casual and desultory . Runes fines bored him , prostitutes disgusted him , and the quick , brittle , thin-fibred women of the Parisian social and intellectual worlds filled him only with a sense of fecklessnessand frustration . There had been a time when he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter whom he was subsidizing , and he had wondered if he were perhaps , after all , a homosexual . Then the phase passed , as suddenly and inexplicably as it had begun , and he entered into the period of his travels and , with it , a period of almost complete celibacy . . . . But in the presence of this placid , full-bodied , blond and violet-eyed Swedish girl all the old anguish of desire arose to torment him again , far stronger and more imperious than he had ever known it before . On his third night at the inn he invited her to a motion-picture show , and she accepted . Two nights later he made love to her for the first time , and she acquiesced . And on the last day of August , 1937 , exactly three weeks to the day after he had met her , they were married in the registry office of the near-by town of Kristianstad . Early in the fall he took her back to Paris with him , and through the following winter they lived quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught her how to speak French , how to dress and do her hair , how to act with servants , tradesmen , officials , acquaintances , friends . In the beginning he had been plagued by fears that she had married him only for his money , but never once , either by word or act , did she give any indication that this was so . She accepted his gifts and his instruction as she accepted him into her bed and body  --  quietly , matter-of-factly , showing neither avidity nor reluctance . She fitted herself , without so much as a visible tremor of adjustment , into the routine of life which he chose to live.
