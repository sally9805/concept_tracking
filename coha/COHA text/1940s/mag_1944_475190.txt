BY OCTOBER 28th enough information about the double Battle of Santa Cruz had drifted in by radio from smoking Guadal and by the ships that limped in from sea to enable the Japanese admiralty staff to take stock of their posidon . Twice now they had tried sweeping movements down from the north with battleships , cruisers , and carriers . Land-based planes from Henderson Field had turned the first brew sour ; it had been a minor Midway , only prevented from being worse by the ( to them ) inexplicable unwillingness of the Americans to pursue . A happy combination had kept the American land planes out of the second concoction and it was gratifying to know that the detested Hornet had been eliminated not only from this but from all future campaigns . Yet the Japs had to admit that the sea fight at Santa Cruz had been no better than a bloody and violent draw . This was unsatisfactory , since Santa Cruz ashore had become a defeat for them through the failure of the high-sea forces to intervene . But once againthe Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage about using their forces afloat for true offensive action ; a. desire to avoid narrow waters and close contact save in the necessary business of covering convoys to Guadalcanal . The Japanese torpedo , as carried by plane , surface ship , or submarine , had evidently given them the jitters . This is not to say that the Japanese opinion was correct ; but that they held it , and based a new campaign for the recovery of Guadalcanal on exploiting the American weakness for exchanging left jabs from across the ring . The forces running down the slot from Bougainville had suffered losses ; but ( if one included the August 8th affair ) they had given about as good as they took on the water , their guns had put our planes out of action at a crucial moment , and the troops and artillery they had brought had held us to the defensive by land . Very strong forces on such a run not only suffered no loss proportionate to their size ; they were also able to weaken the opposition by night gunfire and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not otherwise be undertaken . Besides , there were now no more Japanese carriers that could lead a new attack from sea all were spent , their flight decks back for long repair , their squadrons wiped out . Among the islands that cluster round the foot of Bougainville the Japanese accordingly assembled what was to he the greatest of all the Tokyo Express assaults . It had four battleships in it , three of them the fast Kangas , which are battle cruisers . There is evidence that the fourth ship of this class had been replaced by a slower , more powerful vessel , maybe Ise , named for the shrine of the sun goddess and therefore a supremely lucky ship . It had cruisers , just which we are not sure , save that the most indubitable proof was later given that some of them were 8-inch-gun heavies , some of them the old light cruisers mounting 5.5 's . It had destroyers , large and small . Most indicative of all , it had as many as twenty or thirty transports , not the spitkits that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those that took the major army of invasion to Malaya . There were enough of them for three full divisions of troops , maybe more . It takes time to assemble a concentration like this and the staff work is not light . While the Japanese forces were gathering , the Americans were to be pinned in their poke around the airfield by the old , tried recipe of bombings by day and shellings by night from small cruiser-destroyer forces that also landed munitions and some reinforcement . The grand attack was set for Here one suddenly plunges from the domain of cold logical calculation into that of wild fantasy , with its reminder that the Japanese are still a medieval people . It has been remarked that Ise was a lucky ship because of her name ; the fact that she bore it is one of the reasons for believing that she was the vessel chosen from four of her class to lead the attack . Nor can the curious repetition of dates in the Japanese attacks escape attention : August 24th , September 24th , October 24th for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 13th , October 12th for themain efforts down the slot . Coincidence , the fact that it took just so long to gather supplies , might explain such a concatenation once or twice , but here it grows beyond accident , and it is not accident . It is astrology ; those were lucky days . Now one of the luckiest of all dates for such an enterprise as was now contemplated was the period from November 13th to November 15th . These days are sacred to the willow and to the sage Ono-no-tofu , who in the immemorial past stood under the streaming rains of November and learned persistence by watching a tree frog seven times leap for a leaf , undiscouraged by previous failure. * The gods were being mobilized in support of this greatest of efforts against Guadalcanal . II N THE days just following Santa Cruz I the largest American convoy since the original landing steamed into " Sleepless Lagoon " and put its troops ashore . It would be about this time that the huge liner President Coolidge struck a pair of mines and sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an intense atmosphere of controversy , for her captain and several of the crew maintained that the mines were American and that the guiding destroyer had given the ship her go-ahead into the area where she went down . The point is not important in itself ? such accidents are as inevitable in war as autos locking wheels in city streets ? but it may provide a clue to why " Oscar " ? the single Jap sub that , earlier in the campaign , had been a nightly visitor ? came no more into Sealark Channel to surface and shell our lines . A submarine in a minefield is the world 's most , helpless warship . The fact that there could be an American minefield is also an indication of the increased force we were putting in . Japanese shells were still falling in the area as the fresh troops came ashore . Both for the sake of more elbow room and to give them a safe landing General Vandegrift staged an offensive as of November 1st . It was a creeping affair of strong patrols in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the rivers both east and west of the airfield and so much of the ground that had been fought over in the desperate battles of late October that the Japanese dead could be counted and buried . There were over 2,000 . The new Army men looked at them curiously , asking a variety of questions about the Japs who spoke English or fought tied to trees , but they got little satisfaction . Both categories belonged to the Imperial Marine Corps and by this time most of the members of that organization on the island were dead . Daytimes our men sunned themselves in shorts outside dugouts , and at night they found sleeping easier than they had been led to expect ; but the idyll did not last . On November 4th the Tokyo Express ran again , depositing some 1,500 men , part east and part west of the airfield . Those on the east started some fighting in the brush which they regretted , for the Army reinforcements were on that front , feeling full of beans , and slugged them hard . There were combats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy Jap air raid on the first day that came in so fast through clouds our fighters could not get to it . More Flying Fortresses arrived , our forces had opulent support from the sky , and by night of the 6th the battle had become a punch into jelly . There was no more real resistance anywhere along the line ; scouts reported that the remains of the 1,500 new Japs had taken to the hills . There were eight motor-torpedo boats now and a base ship for them , which had been run into a bay of Tulagi and decorated with potted palms till she looked like the lobby of a General Grant hotel . The PT 's went out every night , partly into Sealark Channel to keep the Japs from landing at Taivu , partly to the " bitch patrol " where Cape Esperance looks on open sea and they were rocked by the waves of the stormy season . People mostly have the wrong idea about the PT boats . They do not come roaring in with open cutouts like a charge of cavalry ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strike once , and use their speed on the getaway , On thatnight of November 6th Lieutenant " Stilly " Taylor 's boat on the bitch patrol fired its fish and got an explosion , but it was only a possible ; the missile may have hit the rocks of Savo Island . Next night , the 7th , a Japanese destroyer came down to Taivu , moving fast . One of the expendables fired at him ; his lookouts were good , they spotted the torpedo wakes , switched on searchlights , and changed course lightning fast ? to run straight into a fan of four torpedoes fired by Lieutenant Lester Gamble from another . That same night on the bitch patrol we lost a boat , hit in the bows by a Japanese destroyer 's star shell and all chewed to pieces . She made port toward morning , having used her smoke well , but was pretty definitely out of the campaign . Three nights later there was another encounter in the slot , with a hit on a Jap vessel everybody took for a destroyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by gunfire , one by engineering casualty . Torpedo boats are like bombers ; should be used in quantity with constant replacement ? only there was neither quantity nor replacement to be had and the boys who operated them began to feel lonely and beaten down . In the air war the pace was being stepped up as the day of Ono-no-tofu approached . Our planes on the 7th found a big Tokyo Express way up near New Georgia , a cruiser and ten destroyers moving into position for the night run on which they clashed with the PT 's . Instead of hiding , the Japs called up their planes from the new nearby air bases and tried to fight through . There was an air battle ; they had the cruiser badly hit and lost sixteen planes against four , a proportion that need not surprise , since they brought only float-planes and they fed those in piecemeal . When our planes came home from mission they found everyone at Henderson talking excitedly with an Army lieutenant named Dinn , who had just arrived by canoe . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Isabel on October 28th and had been knocked down by flak . The natives gave him a portable throne when they found out he was a birdman , fed him the honorific foods , and made him shake hands with everyone in the villages through which he passed . He taught them " You Are My Sunshine " as an addition to their one-song repertoire , " Jesus Loves Me " ; they captured a Jap for him , who was taken along to the encampment and installed as foreman of the gravediggers ' squad . III B uT all this was the overture . The curtain for the big show rose with day on November 12th , when still another American troop convoy steamed in under a forest of masts with the guardian arms of warships around them . Norman Scott was there , who had led at Cape Esperance , this time flying his flag in the new anti-aircraft cruiser Atlanta . But he was not in command of the group ; that office belonged to Rear Admiral Daniel Callaghan , " Uncle Dan , " the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meanest mess boy , not least by the captains who knew that more than half of tactics is in his " Follow Me . " He was on the bridge of San Francisco ; there was another heavy cruiser . Portland ; there were eight destroyers , Atlanta 's sister Juneau , and that workhorse light cruiser , the Helena , which went into action at once . For the Tokyo Express was also a freight train . It had brought a consignment of 6- and 5-inch guns which the Japs had set up near the mouth of the Kokombona River for just such an occasion as this . As the transports began to unload , these guns croaked all together and splash-fountains rose among the ships . Helena steamed off to deal with them , the fastest-shooting ship in the fleet , with her battery of fifteen guns and a file of destroyers to help her , of which Buchanan got hit and lost five men . They put the Japanese batteries to silence and moved along the shore , shooting up Japanese artillery positions where they lay along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were having a lovely time with about thirty landing craft which the enemy had not had time to hide under the jungle edge , when TBS flashed a recall ? Jap planes coming . Helena turned back . All the ships had etrarn 01 , tra n cnnrtc were dictIncrri in lines parallel to the direction of the Jap approach with the warships circling around them , and twenty-eight Grummans took off from Henderson Field . Against the bright sky over Florida Island they were silhouetted for a moment like flies on a windowpane , and then a long , thin ribbon of Mitsubishi torpedo planes came pouring over and down as though they had been shot out of a hose . As they cleared the island they started to spread for the classic all-angles attack , but they never made it . The Grummans had ridden them hard ; their fighter cover was stripped ; sixteen of the bombers were already flaming down when the ships opened with their 40 's in a tumult of fire that only one of the attackers lived through . But three torpedoes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swooped in a sharp curve toward San Francisco . She dodged ; the plane missed the bridge , but hit Bat II , the secondary control station that overlooks number 3 turret . There was a sharp explosion , a spray of burning gasoline that took the lives of thirty men and seriously wounded the exec , Commander Mark Crouter . Ten minutes from the first gun there was no trace of battle but the plume of smoke from the cruiser and that single Jap plane running north with its engine on fire and a Grumman buzzing angrily after it . The Japs had lost thirty-two out of thirty-three , the same score as in the attack on South Dakota during the Santa Cruz battle , but that time at least they got a bomb hit and on this occasion nothing . IV p ? TRHAT night our transports left the bay , which tells its own story of how fast and well the Seabees had worked to unload them . The cruisers saw them out . Ashore the word went round that Tajo was coming , and strong ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 , - 000 tons , the biggest in the Oriental world , besides other ships . Our planes had tracked him all day through changing weather . General Vandegrift was happy enough ; our latest arrivals , he said , had nut it oast the nower of the Tans to land enough men for victory in any single operation . But the old hands , the Marines , made themselves small in foxholes they dug deeper that day , and swore . " Where 's our Navy ? " they asked . They could see San Francisco and Portland , Helena , the anti-aircraft cruisers and destroyers , riding into Sleepless Lagoon after taking the transports out , and it did not look to them like the kind of fleet with which a man in his senses opposes an enemy who has battleships . Perhaps it was not ; but it was the fleet Uncle Dan Callaghan had and would do his best with . He formed them after dark , the destroyer Cushing leading the line with Commander Edward Parker , who had skippered another destroyer through that wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships went down and they fired at each other . Behind Cushing came Lieutenant Commander W. E. Hank 's Laffey , 0 ' Bannon , Buchanan , then Atlanta , San Francisco , Helena , Portland , Juneau and more destroyers ? an arrangement symmetrical , with the strong ships all at the center of the line , whereas the schools of tactics teach that they should occupy the extremities . But what is a strong ship ? In the murk of night , in those close waters , Admiral Callaghan judged it to be a ship that could use the torPedo as its first and deadly weapon . H AVING given his men some rest the Admiral turned northwest along the Guadal coast , pointing toward the more southerly of the gaps around Savo Island . The planes had been flown off and were over at Tulagi to keep them from burning on the catapults in action as they had during the August battle . It was after midnight and the rich voice of the Admiral came through the speakers outlining the desperate venture of battle in which they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did with " Let 's go get ' em . " Then it was one o'clock , it was after one o'clock , and the ships passed Point Cruz , turning right angles in succession to a northerly course . It was half past the hour when the TBS from Helena carried word to all ships , " Here they come , " with something about an enormous fleet south of Savo Island . Callaghan swung sharp left to close the range , then sharp right again to stay across the bows of the enemy rushing down at top speed , and shouted " Commence firing ! Give ' em hell , boys ! " Before the last words left his lips Helena 's fifteen guns went off all together and in ten seconds the air was full of the glare of star shell and the water full of level gun flashes . Two Jap scout planes had gone up to cast flares ; caught in that first blaze of light they were targets for every pompom in the fleet and came crashing down as the converging courses of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had not been seen since Jutland . It is impossible to view that three-ring circus save through the eyes of individual ships , and not always then . At the head of the line Cushing found herself in action with two or three destroyers coming in on her port side ; hit them and was herself hit almost at once . Commander Parker felt his ship 's speed fall off and could not raise the forward engine room by phone ; ordered a spread of torpedoes From number 3 tube , but as he did so the torpedoman was hit and got off only one of his fish , which missed . He looked from the bridge wings ; off the port quarter , clearly outlined against a glare of gunfire and now-burning ships , was the hulking form of a Jap battleship not one of your Kongos with their funnels pinched together in a mass of midship superstructure : but with tower distinct , a gap , then funnel , then a tower again ? big game , Fuso or Ise . He gave his dying ship full rudder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted how one , two giant waterspouts sprang up on the far side of that battleship , their spray turned red by flame within and behind . Torpedo hits . " Action starboard , " he said and fired his torpedoes ; there was a hit , maybe more than one , then Cushing herself was hit again and began to go down . The hits Parker saw had been from our destroyer Lafey , which spotted the Jap battleship first and charged straight for her bows , firing her spread on the run in . They almost collided ; the destroyer 's wheel went down , she cut under the forefoot of the monster by a margin that seemed no more than ten feet , shooting out the Jap 's bridge with her 5-inch but in return taking heavy punishment from secondaries , turning left toward Savo to get away . The next flashes showed another battleship broad on the beam and two big Jap destroyers off the port bow . Both swung to fire torpedoes ; the guns opened up and Laffey 's people saw a flame spring from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that indicated a burning magazine . Then a torpedo hit Lab , aft , she began to go , but the three guns still remaining tore at the wounded Jap from a range where misses were impossible . Down she went , but now Laffey was done too and her crew abandoned ship just as the second Jap battlewagon opened up on them with 14-inch shell . Atlanta was just making the final northward turn when her lookouts picked up something on the starboard bow . As her guns swung in that direction the ship wasabruptly caught in a searchlight beam from the other side . The turrets spun fast , she fired six quick salvos at the searchlight ship , a three-funneled cruiser , hitting and being hit , but getting all the best of the exchange , for the Jap had no such battery as this new cruiser . The searchlights went out , the three-funnel job heeled over and began to burn , and just then three Jap destroyers foamed across Atlanta 's bow no more than 600 yards away . The first two got past but " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hitting her every four seconds with all the guns that would bear . She blew up and disappeared . Then we were torpedoed . " Two of the torpedoes hit Atlanta in the engine rooms , killing all power , and the ship drifted round to a southerly course away from the action which for her had lasted something less than a minute . Away behind , ships were burning all over the water or blowing up ; the waves of their movement heaved the little cruiser around like those of a full gale , though the action had started with the lagoon as calm as a bathtub . It was dark ; out of that dark astern to the north suddenly plunged a heavy cruiser which threw a light on Atlanta and hit her with nineteen big shells , all over , wrecking everything . Captain Jenkins ran to the port wing of the bridge to see whether he could get a torpedo off ; too many men had been killed aft and he could not , but the effort saved his life , for one of those big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Norman Scott . 3 an Francisco seems to have encountered the leading Jap ships how to bow while still pointing west . The first was a cruiser , and the American flagship hit it with six salvos ; then Helena and the cruiser following also hit it . It began to burn throughout its length ; next San Francisco shifted to a flotilla leader and had hit that a couple of times when the battle glare threw up the leading Jap battleship with Laffey 's torpedoes exploding against her sides . " Get on that goddam pagoda ! " shouted someone on the bridge . Cruiser and battleship fired together ; at that 2,500-yard range San Francisco 's shells went right through her big antagonist 's armor and must have torn her all to pieces inside , but she was shooting back with 14-inch , and though the guns could not be depressed enough to hit our ship on the waterline , the shells went off in the bridge structure and blew out that brain of the ship . Lieutenant Commander Bruce McCandless in the port wing of the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragment that gave him a wound . As he picked himself up to find Captain Young and Commander Crouter dead , the conning tower was hit by another big shell that killed Admiral Callaghan , and Bat II by still another that wiped out everyone there . McCandless grabbed a phone to tell Lieutenant Commander Herbert Schonland of Damage Control that he was the senior surviving officer , but Schonland was in the midst of his own desperate fight to keep the cruiser afloat against the water pouring in through shell holes in her side . " Con the ship , " he snapped back . and McCandless found himself commander of the ship and admiral of a fleet scattered through the night . Fortunately the big cruiser 's power plant was intact , though one section of blowers had been knocked out and the other brought so much smoke into the engine spaces that the men there had to work in gas masks . McCandless found that neither main nor secondary steering control was working , but the phone to central station , far below , was in order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head west between the double column of Japs while Helena and Portland behind her pumped shells into the enemy battleship till it ceased fire and turned away north . As the tail ends of the lines swept past each other there were stabs of gunfire and the rush of more torpedoes ; Juneau got one amidships , Portland took one that smashed her rudder , and two more of our destroyers were fatally hit , Barton and Monssen , but not till one of them had soaked a torpedo into some big Jap never clearly identified , probably the second battleship . Then the enemy were away around the north of Savo , leaving two cruisers and four destroyers on the bottom . The action had lasted a little better than seventeen minutes . V it F wAs not entirely over . What was left of our battle line , now under guidance of McCandless , came down to the cover of our batteries on the northern shore of Guadalcanal . Dawn comes early in those waters ; in the first half-light Portland spied a Jap destroyer trying to crawl slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her turrets and while the damage-control parties labored below , put out six quick salvos that sent the Jap to the bottom . The shells passed over the heads of hundreds of swimmers , Japanese and American . Higgins boats were already out to pick up survivors but the Japs fired at them from the water and the rescuers had to carry machine guns . They only got twenty-five live prisoners and they could see along toward the usual Jap landing beaches that some new boats had put in during the night , apparently while the battle was going on . When the fliers went out to look for the ships from which these boats had come they found the pot of gold . The big Jap battleship had taken a little more than even a battleship can stand from the light craft we had in action ; she was just beyond Savo , making for home at no more than five knots , low in the water and with five destroyers around her . The news spread electrically through the encampment where the survivors of our lost ships were finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little carefully hoarded delicacies ? a bar of chocolate , a cigar , a hidden bottle of Japanese beer . All the torpedo and dive-bombers on the island were hastily readied and took off into the rising sun . Torpedo 3 was there , the squadron whose carrier section had been wiped out at Midway , now led to revenge by " Swede " Larsen ; Captain Joe Foss was there ? the Marine fighter ace who had just run his score of Jap planes to twentyone ? and others , a truly formidable concentration of the best in U. S. Naval Air . But it turned into a singular and for some time an inexplicable operation . There was no Jap air cover and the weather was favorable to the attack , with low overcast and fits of rain . In the very first exchange Marine Major Sailer wiped out one of the Jap ship 's AA positions with a dive-bomb just as it was manned to beat off a torpedo attack led by Larsen . Larsen got a hit ; half an hour later there was another and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two more torpedoes toward noon ; she kept going . They were talking of the " unsinkable battleship " ; one pilot wiped sweat from his face and ejaculated , " The damn thing apparently will float till the war 's over . " " We 've got to sink her , " said another . " We 've just got to , or the admirals will stop building carriers and start building battleships all over again . " The afternoon went by like that . Out in the channel they had finally fixed up the heavy cruiser 's rudder and scuttled Atlanta as beyond repair . What was left of Admiral Callaghan 's fleet gathered itself together and steamed out to the south . The returning fliers brought word that the unsinkable ship was still moving , just barely , down by the stern now and with only a couple of guns working . It is said that a Marine major solved the mystery , suddenly clapping his hand to his forehead . All those torpedoes ? they had been set for shallow runs , to take the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transports , and with that battleship down deep they must be exploding against her armor belt , piling up damage but not killing . The last flight of the day went out with torpedoes in deep settings and got three hits . The battleship stopped in the twilight , its whole stern red from internal fires , with men being taken off . In the morning there was nothing on the spot or near it but a two-mile slick of iridescent oil . Sunk . We had a loss too , in the last act of the day when our fleet pulled southward with the cruisers all pretty well smashed and the remaining destroyers in company so much abused that their sound gear was out of commission . They were making twenty knots , which is too fast for submarine approach , but luck or clever calculation by the Japs would take the column right into an area where they had a U-boat waiting to pick on cripples . The men on our other ships heard a violent explosion and saw a column of oil go up at the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torpedo in the night . Under it the ship simply disintegrated . " I saw a piece of the mainmast coming down and doubled up to protect myself . I remember a sharp pain . A second later I dropped over the rail to the main deck , twenty feet below , but I was already in water up to my chest . " The other ships had to steam on out of the danger area ; all planes were fighting and so without good rescue there were only thirteen survivors . A bad end to a good day , but it turned worse by night , when the Japs poured another whole division of their fleet down the slot where there were now no American ships to oppose them and gave Guadalcanal a thorough shelling . " The worst one ever , with all that 14-inch ; it just drives you crazy , " commented one man who lay beneath it . In some of the shell holes men were crying or talking about how to make coffee , or Rita Hayworth 's legs , or anything to give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel . But in the technical sense it was nervous exhaustion more than damage . Unlike the October shellings this one caused few casualties ? only three planes smashed ; and though seventeen others were damaged , they were in the air before night of November 15th and the motor-torpedo boats raided the Jap armada as it whirled past , getting a fish into a fine cruiser . VI E12.1-TAPS that torpedo hit sent the bom- barding squadron away before it intended to go , before it had accomplished its purpose of crippling the Henderson Field planes . If so , it can be regarded as one of the decisive minor events of the campaign . There are military advantages in the Japanese system of politico-religious fanaticism ; it produces in the subject a self-sacrificing devotion which keeps him at the guns , as cool as at target practice , with the world collapsing around . It permits the home authorities to concentrate production on pure fighting equipment without having to bother with such details as life jackets for warship crews or parachutes for those of airplanes . But the cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forfeiture of many that might be saved for use , and that is what happened on the morning of November 15th . On the previous day the scouting planes that stumbled over the unsinkable battleship had flown on into the upper Solomons . It will be remembered that their mission was to look for transports . They found them not the small craft from which landing boats had presumably reached the beaches during the battle , but something much more important , the NYK 18,000-tonner with seven others of which the smallest was 10,000 or 12,000 tons , and four cargo vessels of similar dimensions . Their decks were black with men , at least two divisions , maybe more . They spent all that day , the 14th , jigging around just beyond bomber range . During the night they began to move in , for even a fast transport is slower than a warship and the run through the American bomber belt would have to be made at least partly by daylight . According to Japanese calculation there should have been no effective bomber belt left by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the night of the 13th and another on the 14th . A single bombardment of much less intensity had left the field practically without planes at the time of the battle of Santa Cruz , three weeks before . But Admiral Callaghan 's death ride had altogether canceled the bombardment of the 13th and that of the 14th had been turned into a half-baked performance by the attack of the motor-torpedo boats . We had planes ; they were in the air ; and when the Japanese expeditionary force was located only 150 miles from Guadalcanal shortly before noon , our planes went hunting . Some officers thought they detected evidence of a small Jap carrier , an auxiliary , somewhere in the background . It could not have amounted to much , for when the fighters with which our attack force was liberally provided had shot down eight Zeros at a cost of only one of their own , any remaining Jap planes ran away and the transports were stripped of air cover . Their protecting warships ( all small ) also cleared out like good Oriental realists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no protection but the ordinary armament of vessels not intended to fight . Tr was massacre , it was horrible , it was A war . Our pilots came back calling themselves " buzzards , " hating themselves a trifle , to tell how in the first attack two of the big ships had gone down to leave the water for half a mile around full of little men in khaki uniforms who gradually disappeared ; how the bombs went down through decks and the ships burned inside till the details of their machinery were picked out as though with magenta-colored paint . The convoy had its orders ; it crept remorselessly toward Guadalcanal into the flame . Our bombers went back to refuel and took off again ; our fighters came down and tore their decks to pieces with .50 caliber machine-gun fire . Ship after ship went down till the sun sank and a crescent moon rose ; and when the exhausted pilots staggered to their dugouts for a rest only four of that convoy were left , two of them burning . But we were not out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that early moon word of the destruction of more than 20 , - 000 Jap troops was accompanied by other and more ominous tidings . One of the last scouts in had spotted the Jap battleship force that had given the encampment so dreadful a shelling on the previous night , sliding down the slot toward Guadalcanal for another blow . " Where the hell is the goddam Navy ? " asked angry men and men tired to the limit of endurance . They heard the ncws over at Tulagi too , where the PT 's were based . Some of the boats had been injured on the night of the 14th and two had been in collision . There were just three left that could move ; and they moved out to the area of the bitch patrol to tackle a Jap battle fleet with the air of Sydney Carton going to the scaffold . They were still there with throttled motors after eleven o'clock when darker shadows among the shades round Savo Island told them the Japs were on the way . Just at that moment a voice not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ching Chong Lee , " it said . " Get out of the way ; I 'm coming through .

" You may fire when you are ready , " said Willis Augustus Lcc on TBS , and at that same moment the flagship 's guns ripped out such a flame as had never been seen in battle before . South Dakota joined ; both hit with the first fire . From the flagship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they could see the two enemy ships " begin to glow like the end of a cigarette . " Black smoke billowed out under the futile star shells they fired too short , the glow spread until it engulfed the ships entire , and with reports that would have been deafening but for the thunder of the guns they blew apart . The third Jap turned ; the flagship 's guns caught him on the turn and he slid into the rocks of Savo , a flaming wreck . All the radio receivers bore a sudden wild flood of Jap appeal and chatter ; out from under cover of the island rushed a group of Jap destroyers with a cruiser to lead them for a torpedo counterattack , and Lee 's covering destroyers charged to beat them off , with the battleships firing secondaries over their heads . One of the Japs burst into flame ; so did Preston , Benham , and Walke of ours , and on another of ours , a sailor who came through picked a piece of 8-inch out of his helmet with the remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last two minutes . The 35,000-ton battleships sidestepped the torpedoes like dancers and rushed on past Savo . There was a five-minute lull , in which must have fallen that incident described by Chairman Byrnes of War Mobilization : " In the night of November 15th off Guadalcanal there lay a Jap battleship . Eight miles away was a ship of our fleet . With the use of radar our ship " laid her guns on the Jap as the latter thrust inquiring searchlight beams across the water . The American battleships opened up together ; six salvos , 108 shells of over a ton apiece poured into the Jap rapid fire , and the watchers on the hilltops caught their breath at the most awe-inspiring sight in naval history , for that formidable mechanism spouted a huge flame amidships , then turned over on her side so rapidly that the last unchecked shells went through her bottom to explode among the decks as she vanished . That would have been one of the Kongos. 1 ' r UT she was not the only Jap ship in ac-tion ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was another battleship in the background , shooting at and hitting South Dakota with shells that sent up fountains of sparks and ringing steel . One hit her belt ; it did not penetrate . Another struck the base of number 3 turret and put a dent . in its armor steel that it was past the art of the dockyard men to remove . It did not penetrate either . The American flagship was dueling fiercely with this vessel , hitting her again and again , so hard that our people to this day insist she ceased fire because she went down , nor could our fliers find any trace of her the following morning ; but the Navy makes no claims beyond damage . It does make claims on the other members of that fleet , the cruisers that rushedto support their battleships , plastering South Dakota 's upper works with 5.5- and 8-inch shell , first by the glare of the searchlights which they threw on her when their battleships ' lights went out , then by light of the fires that broke out on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a holiday by comparison " ; the sky control was knocked out , everyone there killed or wounded , there was a fire beneath Bat II that made the deck red hot , a steam line was cut and the upper spaces of the ship were filled with it . But on the Jap cruisers it was worse . One broke in two and went down , bow and stern sticking from the water , another oddly collapsed in the opposite direction , bow and stern under , the torn midships section spouting crossed fires . Then South Dakota twisted out of the last searchlight beam , it was dark all around , the fires extinguished and the battle over . Half an hour ; of all those Jap radio babblings only three or four voices were left , one of those identifiable as a Guadalcanal shore station . 11 HEY set a trap for foxes , but we did n't think it would hold bears , " said Captain Catch later . The Japanese South Pacific fleet had in fact ceased to exist as a military entity , and Guadalcanal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and planes ; there were many weary weeks of fighting still ahead , ships to sink and men to die . The Japs would not surrender , but then neither would an army of rats attacked by cats ; there was no more question about the result , no more doubt in anyone 's mind . Their officers knew it and no longer led attacks , not even by way of honorable suicide . They waited to be picked up in the slow advance across the ridges . Their artillerists knew and from the batteries that bore on our encampment fired exactly eighteen shells . The batteries were not there long , for our men had no doubts either now ; the next morning they began the attacks that carried them to the limits of the island and beyond into the upper Solomons and to everything that flowed therefrom .
