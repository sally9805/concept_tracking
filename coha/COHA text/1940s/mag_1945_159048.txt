High in the ranks of U.S. educators is a man who has not lived in the U.S. for 40 years . Since 1919 , thin , balding John Leighton Stuart , 69 , has been President of China 's No. 1 Christian university , American-endowed Yenching . The past three and a half of these years have been spent in Jap captivity . In Chungking last week Dr. Stuart , perhaps the most respected American in China , told his story . <P> When the Japs overran Peiping in 1937 , Yenching , just five miles away , became an oasis of free learning : the Japs then were too sensitive to U.S. opinion to move in . But they ordered President Stuart to hoist the puppet-regime flag and to give personal " thanks " to the Jap militia for the invasion . Dr. Stuart refused , and got away with it . For three years before Pearl Harbor he was used to transmit peace feelers between the Chinese and the Japs . At 8:20 a.m. , Dec. 8 , 1941 , Dr. Stuart 's freedom ended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cooped up for 39 months with two others , in three dimly lit rooms in the back of a British mercantile establishment in Peiping . His fellow prisoners : Dr. Henry S. Houghton , 66 , director of Peiping Union Medical College , and Trevor Bowen , 59 , its comptroller . <P> Bowen breakfasted at 7 , Houghton and Stuart at 9 . Stuart spent the forenoon writing on his pet subject : New Testament criticism . At lunch all three took turns reading aloud the German war communiques from the English edition of Osaka Mainichi . High point of the day was " cocktail hour , " when the three met to re-chew the morsels of news they had read at lunch . Every night Houghton and Stuart played anagrams-altogether 1,500 games . ( Dr. Houghton wrote a book on anagrams which should be the definitive work . ) <P> In May 1943 , the trio was broken up for five days . The Japs locked Comptroller Bowen in a bamboo cage not wide or long enough to lie down in while they questioned , threatened and kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical college had hidden its famed archeological relic , the bones of Peiping Man , presumably so they could present them to the Emperor . Bowen did not know ) . <P> In July , the Japs issued an imperial edict freeing Dr. Stuart-if he would ask Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to negotiate with the U.S. for Japan . He refused either to leave his two companions or to transmit the terms . Less than a month later all three were free . <P> As soon as able Educator Stuart can move Yenching back to Peiping ( it has been limping along in exile at Chengtu ) , he plans to retire , end his days in China .
