The glare has been removed from glass . The first practical process for treating big and small surfaces to eliminate light reflection was announced this week by its inventor , H. R. Moulton of the American Optical Co . <P> An improvement over a previously developed vacuum process for treating small glass surfaces , Moulton 's invention is a simple coating that makes glass and other materials nonreflecting-and virtually invisible . Restricted to military uses for the duration , it will provide the postwar world with such useful things as : spectacle lenses that will cut out bright-light reflections for their wearer and be almost invisible to others ; glareless car windshields ; more visible dashboards and instrument panels ; store windows , showcases , picture frames , watch crystals and clockfaces so clear that the glass is invisible ; - faster camera lenses , producing sharper pictures ; clearer movies and television .
