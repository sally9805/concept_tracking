In Moscow , Foo Ping-sheung , China 's ambassador to Russia , pondered a telegram last week . It announced his appointment as Premier Ho Ying-chin 's new foreign minister . Asked if he would accept , Foo said : " Would n't it be like jumping into the fire ? ... I think people live longer in New Zealand . " <P> While Foo debated where to go , Premier Ho and the rest of his cabinet picked five men to carry Nationalist China 's peace hopes to the Communists . As nominal head of the delegation they named General Chang Chih-chung , former governor of Sinkiang Province and commander of Nationalist headquarters in northwest China . A close friend of China 's No. 2 Communist , General Chou Enlai , he was the only important member of former Premier Sun Fo 's cabinet the Reds failed to tag as a war criminal . Another member : soprano-voiced Shao Li-tse , a former ambassador to Russia . <P> Red reaction came quickly . From Peiping , instead of its former station in north Shensi , the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the party 's Central Committee had moved to China 's ancient cultural capital . Peiping had officially become Communist China 's No. 1 city . Here , the voice of Red China continued , five Communist leaders would meet on April 1 to discuss peace terms with the Nationalists . <P> Chief of the Red quintet that will face Premier Ho 's delegation is Chou Enlai , Mao 's eloquent first lieutenant . Backing him up will be General Yeh Chien-ying , Communist army chief of staff and now mayor of Peiping . When he took office in February , Yeh told Peiping 's municipal workers : " I often make mistakes and I welcome correction . But I would not welcome it chalked on the toilet wall . " Other Red delegates : General Lin Piao , conqueror of Manchuria ; Lin Po-chu , chairman of the Communist Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia border government ; Li Weihan , Communist party whip and negotiator at Marshall mission conferences two years ago . <P> At week 's end , a Chinese newsman sized up the two peace delegations : " The Reds are offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> <P> * With its new station , the Communist radio acquired new techniques : women announcers were replaced by men , musical interludes of native songs gave way to Chopin .
