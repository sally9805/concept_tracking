ME is often needed for us to recognize the great miscarriages of justice . The Dreyfus case had lasted four years before public opinion was fully aroused . The trials of Sacco and Vanzetti endured six years . As time passes , it becomes more and more plain that our wartime treatment of the Japanese and the Japanese-Americans on the West Coast was a tragic and dangerous mistake . That mistake is a threat to society , and to all men . Its motivation and its impact on our system of law deny every value of democracy . In the perspective of our legal tradition , the facts are almost incredible . During the bleak spring of 1942 , the Japanese and the Japanese-Americans who lived on the West Coast of the United States were taken into custody and removed to camps in the interior . More Corwrizht. 1945. by Ilnrner than one hundred thousand men , women , and children were thus exiled and imprisoned . More than two-thirds of them were American citizens . These people were taken into custody as a military measure on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from persons of Japanese blood . The whole group was removed from the West Coast because the military authorities thought it would take too long to conduct individual investigations on the spot , They were arrested without warrants and were held without indictment or a statement of charges , although the courts were open and freely functioning . They were transported to camps far from their homes , and kept there under prison conditions , pending investigations of their " loyalty . " Despite the good intentions of the chief relocation officers , the centers AA RitAtq were little better than concentration camps , If the evacuees were found " loyal , " they were released only if they could find a job and a place to live , in a community where no hoodlums would come out at night to chalk up anti-Japanese slogans , break windows , or threaten riot . If found " disloyal " in their attitude to the war , they were kept in the camps indefinitely ? although sympathy with the enemy is no crime in the United States ( for white people at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the visible threat of deeds . On May 1 , 1945 , three years after the program was begun , about 70 , - 000 persons were still in camps . While it is hoped to have all these people either free , or in more orthodox confinement , by January 1 , 1946 , what is euphemistically called the Japanese " relocation " program will not be a closed book for many years . T HE ORIGINAL program of " relocation " was an injustice , in no way required or justified by the circumstances of the war . But the Supreme Court , in three extraordinary decisions , has upheld its main features as constitutional . This fact converts a piece of wartime folly into national policy ? a permanent part of the law ? a doctrine enlarging the power of the military in relation to civil authority . It is having a sinister impact on the minority problem in every part of the country . It is giving aid to reactionary politicians who use social division and racial prejudice as their tools . The precedent is be-. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both citizens and aliens . As Mr. Justice Jackson has said , the principle of these decisions " lies about like a loaded weapon ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need . " All in all , the case of the Japanese-Americans is the worst blow our liberties have sustained in many years . Unless repudiated , it may support devastating and unforeseen social and political conflicts . I NV THAT WAS done in the name of mili- tary precaution on the West Coastwas quite different from the security measures taken in Hawaii or on the East Coast , although both places were active theaters of war in 1942 . On the East Coast enemy aliens were controlled without mass arrests or evacuations , despite their heavy concentration in and near shipping and manufacturing centers . Aliens had been registered , and the police had compiled information about fascist sympathizers , both aliens and citizens . " On the night of December 7 , 1941 , " Attorney General Biddle reported , " the most dangerous of the persons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks a number of others were apprehended . Each arrest was made on the basis of information concerning the specific alien taken into custody . We have used no dragnet techniques and have conducted no indiscriminate , large-scale raids . " General regulations were issued , somewhat restricting the freedom of all enemy aliens over fourteen years of age . They were forbidden to enter military areas ; they had to get the District Attorney 's permission before traveling ; they were forbidden to own or use firearms , cameras , short-wave radio sets , codes , ciphers , or invisible ink . This control plan kept security officers informed , but otherwise allowed the aliens almost their normal share in the work and life of the community , Enemy ' aliens under suspicion , and those who violated the regulations , were subject to summary arrest , and were then promptly examined by one of the special Alien Enemy Hearing Boards . These boards could recommend that the individual alien be interned , paroled , or released unconditionally . The examinations were smoothly conducted , and they did nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aliens in the country , 9,080 had been examined by the end of June 1943 , about 4,000 of them being then interned . By June 30 , 1944 , the number interned had been reduced to approximately 2,500 . In Hawaii a different procedure was followed , but one less drastic than the evacuation program pursued on the West Coast , although Hawaii was certainly a more active theater of war . Imme.ii. ately after Pearl Harbor , martial law was installed in Hawaii , and the commanding general assumed the role of military governor . Yet , although about one-third the population of Hawaii is of Japanese descent , and although the tension was great after the Pearl Harbor raid , there was no mass roundup on the islands . Fewer than 800 Japanese aliens were sent to the mainland for internment , and fewer than 1,000 persons of Japanese ancestry , 912 of them being citizens , were sent to relocation centers on the mainland . Many of the latter group were families of interned aliens , transferred voluntarily . Those arrested in Hawaii were taken into custody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination or observed behavior . Even under a regime of martial law , men were arrested as individuals , and not because of the color of their skins . Safety was assured without mass arrests , or needless hardship . O N THE West Coast the security program was something else again . Immediately after Pearl Harbor there were no special regulations for persons of Japanese extraction . Known enemy sympathizers among the Japanese , like white traitors and enemy agents , were arrested . There was no sabotage by persons of Japanese ancestry . There was no reason to suppose that the 112,000 persons of Japanese descent on the West Coast , less than 2 per cent of the population , constituted a greater menace than such persons in Hawaii , where they were 32 per cent of the population . After a month 's silence , the organized minority whose business it has been to exploit racial tensions on the West Coast went to work . They had strong support in the Hearst press and its equivalents . Politicians , fearful of an unknown public opinion , spoke out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Hiram Johnson , urged the administration to exclude all persons of Japanese blood from the coast states . Anti-Oriental spokesmen appeared before special hearings of the Tolan Committee , and explained the situation as they conceived it to Lieutenant General J. L. DeWitt , commanding the Western Defense Command . Tension was intensified , and doubters , worried about the risks of another Pearl Harbor , remained silent , preferring too much caution to too little . An opinion crystallized in favor of evacuating the Japanese . After some hesitation , General DeWitt proposed the policy of exclusion on grounds of military need . The War Department backed him up . No one in the government took the responsibility for opposing or overruling him . Despite the nature of the emergency , the Army 's lawyers wanted more legal authority before action was taken . The President issued an Executive Order in February 1942 , and in March Congress passed a statute , authorizing military commanders to designate " military areas " and to prescribe the terms on which any persons could enter , leave , or remain in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away individually had shown signs of producing confusion . it was therefore decided to establish a compulsory system of detention in camps , to simplify the process of resettlement , and to afford the fullest measure of security . T HE HISTORY of law affords nothing more fantastic than the evidence which is supposed to justify this program . General DeWitt 's final recommendation to the Secretary of War , dated February 14 , 1942 , but not made public until early in 1944 , explains the basis of his decision . " In the war in which we are now engaged , " he said , " racial affinities are not severed by migration . The Japanese race is an enemy race and while many second and third generation Japanese born on United States soil , possessed of United States citizenship , have become Americanized , ' the racial strains are undiluted . " From the premise of a war of " races , " the general had no difficulty reaching his conclusion . There is " no ground for assuming , " he said , that Japanese-Americans will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea that men are presumed innocent until proved guilty , and that American citizens stand on an equal footing before the law without regard for race , color , or previous condition of servitude ! " it therefore follows , " the general added , " that along the vital Pacific Coast over 112,000 potential enemies , of Japanese extraction , are at large today . There are disturbing indications that these are organized and ready for concerted action at a favorable opportunity . The very fact that no sabotage has taken place to date is a disturbing and confirming indication that such action will be taken . " There was somewhat more evidence than the absence of sabotage to prove its special danger . The Japanese lived closely together , often concentrated around harbors and other strategic areas . Japanese clubs and religious institutions played an important part in their segregated social life . Japanese language schools existed , to preserve for the American born something of the cultural heritage of Japan . The Japanese government , like that of many other countries , asserted a doctrine of nationality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims of dual citizenship . Thus a long-standing conflict in international law , involving many countries other than Japan , was invoked to cast special doubt on the loyalty of American citizens of Japanese descent . Much of the suspicion inferentially based on these statements disappears on closer examination . In many instances the concentration of Japanese homes around strategic areas had come about years before , and for entirely innocent reasons . Japanese cannery workers , for example , had had to live on the waterfront in order to be near the plants in which they worked . Japanese truck gardeners had rented land in the industrial outskirts of large cities to be close to their markets . They had rented land for gardening under high tension lines ? regarded as a very suspicious circumstance ? because the company could not use the land for other purposes ; the initiative in starting this practice had come from the utility companies , not from the Japanese . Despite discrimination against the Japanese , many had done well in America . They were substantial property owners . Their children participated normally and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their unions and social organizations had passed resolutions of loyalty in great number , before and after Pearl Harbor . It is difficult to find real evidence that either religious or social institutions among the Japanese had successfully fostered Japanese militarism or other dangerous sentiments . The Japanese language schools , which the Japanese-Americans themselves had long sought to put under state control , seem to represent little more than the familiar desire of many immigrant groups to keep alive the language and tradition of the " old country " ; in the case of Japanese-Americans , knowledge of the Japanese language was of particular economic importance , since so much of their working life was spent with other Japanese on the West Coast . QOME ELEMENTS among the Japanese were , of course , suspect . They were known to the authorities , who had for several years been checking on the Japanese-American population . Many had been individually arrested immediately after Pearl Harbor , and the others were under constant surveillance . It is also true that a considerable percentage of the evacuees later gave negative answers to loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in camps . Many of those answers were expressly based upon the treatment the individuals had received ; the same shock of evacuation and confinement undoubtedly was responsible indirectly for many more . Basically , however , the issue of abstract loyalty is irrelevant . Disloyalty , even in the aggravated farm of enthusiastic verbal support for the Axis cause , is not a crime in the United States . At most , it is a possible ground for interning enemy aliens . Citizens must do more than talk or think disloyal thoughts before being arrested and jailed . Apart from the members of the group known to be under suspicion , there was no evidence beyond the vaguest fear to connect the Japanese on the West Coast with the unfavorable military events of 1941 and 1942 . Both at Pearl Harbor and in sporadic attacks on the West Coast the enemy had s:town that he had knowledge of our dispositions . There was some signaling to enemy ships at sea , both by radio and by lights , along the West Coast . There were several episodes of shelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such cases mentioned by General DeWitt as tending to create suspicion of the Japanese-Americans took place after their removal from the coast . ( These were the only such items in his report which were not identided by date . ) And those subsequently arrested as Japanese agents in the Pearl Harbor area were all white men . The most striking comment on the quality of the evidence produced by General DeWitt to support his proposal was made by Solicitor General Fahy , whose job it was to defend the general 's plan before the Supreme Court . He relied upon the general 's report " only to the extent that it relates " statistics and other details concerning the actual evacuation and the events which took place after it . But the briefs that he himself presented were identical in the substance of their argument . The Japanese-Americans were an unknown , unknowable , foreign group , living together , and moving in mysterious ways , inscrutable to puzzled white men . Therefore , let them be imprisoned ; let their property be taken into custody , sold off at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots be torn up , let their children suffer the irreparable shock of life in a concentration camp ; let their relation to society be distorted by the searing memory of humiliation , rejection , and punishment . The evidence supports one conclusion only : the dominant element in the development of our relocation policy was race prejudice , not a military estimate of a military problem . Iv Y THE time the issues raised by this program reached the Supreme Court , the crisis which was supposed to justify it had passed . The first cases came up in June 1943 , the second and third in December 1944 . The course of the war had changed completely ; the Japanese were no longer prowling off California , but fighting defensively among the islands of the Western Pacific . The problem presented to the Supreme Court was thus completely different from that which confronted worried soldiers , legislators , and executive officials in the melancholy months after Pearl Harbor . Invalidation of the relocation scheme would do no possible harm to the prosecution of the war . The Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full weight to its own special responsibilities for the development of constitutional law as a whole . Moreover , the issue for the court was infinitely more complex than that which faced General DeWitt in 1942 . The court had to decide not only whether General DeWitt had acted within the scope of his permissible authority , but whether it should validate what had been done . As many episodes in our constitutional history attest , those are different issues . The court could not escape the fact that it was the Supreme Court , arbiter of a vast system of customs , rules , habits , and relationships . Its decision inevitably would have far-reaching effects ? on the power of the military , on our developing law of emergencies , on the future of those demagogues and political groups which live by attacking minorities , and on the future decision of cases in lower courts and police stations , involving the rights of citizens and aliens , the availability of habeas corpus , and like questions . The question of how and on what grounds the Supreme Court should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . Would a repudiation of Congress , the President , and the military in one aspect of their conduct of the war affect the people 's will to fight ? Would it create a campaign issue for 1944 ? Would it affect the power and prestige of the Supreme Court as a political institution ? TN A bewildering and unimpressive series I of opinions , relieved only by the dissents of Justice Roberts and Justice Murphy in one of the three cases ? Karematszt v. United States ? the court chose to assume that the main issues did not exist . In avoiding the risks of overruling the government on an issue of war policy , it weakened society 's control over military power ? one of the controls on which the whole organization of our society depends . It failed to uphold the most ordinary rights of citizenship , making Japanese-Americans into second-class citizens , who stand before the courts on a different legal footing from other Americans . It accepted and gave the prestige of its support to dangerous racial myths about a minority group , in arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our society . The reasoning of the court was simple and direct . The problem was the scope of the war power of the national government . I3oth Congress and the executive seemed to have decided that special tnea.stires were required because espionage and sabotage were especially to be feared from persons of Japanese descent on the West Coast in the spring of 1942 . It was not the job of the Supreme Court to decide such questions for itself . Its task was that of judicial review ? to uphold the judgment of the officers directly responsible for fighting the war if the court said , there was " any substantial basis " in fact for the conclusion that protective measures were necessary . Two propositions which the court accepted as " facts " were held to afford a sufficiently " rational basis " for military decision . The first was that in time of war " residents having ethnic affiliations with an invading enemy may be a greater source of danger than those of different ancestry " ? a doctrine which belongs with the race theories of the Nazis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American society in both our World Wars . ( The weight of scientific evidence is that the most important driving urge of such minority groups is to conform , not to rebel . ) The second was that on the West Coast in 1942 there was no time to isolate and examine the suspected Japanese on an individual basis ? although of the 110,000 persons subject to the exclusion orders , 43 per cent were over fifty or under fifteen years old ; they had lived in California without committing sabotage for five months after Pearl Harbor ; in the country as a whole , thousands of aliens were examined individually without substantial delay ; and in Britain 74,000 enemy aliens were checked in a few months . By accepting the military judgment on these two points , without any evidence in the record to back it up , without requiring any testimony from the military , and even without adequate discussion by the court itself , the court has taken " judicial notice " of doubtful and controversial propositions of fact , as if they were as well-established as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sent the cases back for a full trial on the justification for General DeWitt 's decision . Instead , it upheld his ruling . Thus it created a profound question as to the position of the military power in our public life . V T HE CONCEPTION of the war power under the American Constitution rests on the experience of the Revolution and the Civil War . It rests on basic political principles which men who had endured those times of trouble had fully discussed and carefully set forth . The chief architects of the conception were men of affairs who had participated in war , and had definite and well-founded ideas about the role of the professional military mind in the conduct of war . The first and dominating principle of the war power under the Constitution is that the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces must be a civilian , elected and not promoted to his office . In no other way can the subordination of the military to the civil power be assured . And in every democracy , the relationship between civil and military power is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time of crisis ultimately depends . The second principle governing the war power in a democracy is that of responsibility . Like every other officer of government , soldiers must answer for their decisions to the nation 's system of law , and not to the Chief of Staff alone . Where military decisions lead to conflicts between individuals and authority ? as in the Japanese exclusion program ? the courts must adjudicate them . It is essential to every democratic value in society that official action , taken in the name of the war power , should be held to standards of responsibility under such circumstances . The courts have not in the past , and should not now , declare such problems to be beyond the reach of judicial review . The present Supreme Court is dominated by the conviction that in the past judicial review has unduly limited the freedom of administrative action . But surely the right answer to bad law is good law , rather than no law at all . The court must review the exercise of military power in a way which permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole that appropriate standards of responsibility have been met . The issue for judicial decision in these cases is not lessened or changed by saying that the war power includes any steps required to win the war . The problem is still one of judgment as to what helps win a war . Who is to decide whether there was a sensible reason for doing what was done ? Is it enough for the general to say that when he acted , he honestly thought it was a good idea to do what he did ? Unless the courts require a showing , in cases like these , of an intelligible relationship between means and ends , society has lost its basic protection against the abuse of military power . The general 's good intentions must be irrelevant . There should be evidence in court that his military judgment had a suitable basis in fact . rr HE HISTORY of this question in the J.L. Supreme Court is unmistakable . The earlier decisions of the court had vigormisty asserted that " what are the allowable limits of military discretion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular case , are judicial questions " ; and that there must be evidence enough to satisfy the court as to the need for the action taken . They had made it clear that the law is not neutral in such issues , but has a positive preference for protecting civil rights where possible , and a long-standing suspicion of the military mind when acting outside its own sphere . Yet in the Japanese-American cases there was literally no evidence whatever by which the court might test the responsibility of General DeWitt 's action . Dozens of Supreme Court decisions had said that the court would not pass on serious constitutional questions without a recordbefore it , establishing the essential facts . Those cases were all ignored . One hundred thousand persons were sent to concentration camps on a record which would n't support a conviction for stealing a dog . The earlier cases not only established the rule that there must be an independent judicial examination of the justification for a military act . They went much further . They declared a simple rule-ofthumb as a gUide in handling cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest , hold , or try people . So Tong as the civil courts were open and functioning , the Supreme Court had previously held , there could be no military necessity for allowing generals to hold , try , or punish people . The safety of the country could be thoroughly protected against treason , sabotage , and like crimes by ordinary arrest and trial in the civil courts , unless the courts were shut by riot , invasion , or insurrection. rr HAT WAS the moral of the great case IL of Ex Park Milligan , decided in 1866 . Ex Parte Milligan is a monument in the democratic tradition , and until now it has been the animating force in this branch of our law . To be sure , there is a tendency nowadays to treat Ex Park Milligan as outmoded , as if new methods of " total " warfare made the case an anachronism ; but those who take this view have forgotten the circumstances of the Civil War , when fifth columns , propaganda , sabotage , and espionage were rife . Ex Parte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active participation in a fifth column plot worthy of Hitler . A group of armed and determined men planned to seize federal arsenals at Columbus , Indianapolis , and at three points in Illinois , and then to release Confederate prisoners of war held in those states . Thus they would create a Confederate army behind the Union lines in Tennessee . Milligan and his alleged co-conspirators acted in Indiana , Missouri , Illinois , and in other border states . Their strategy had a political arm . The Union was to be split politically , and a Northwest Confederation was to be declared , friendly to the South , and embracing six states . This was not an idle dream . Ti was sponsored by a well-financed society , the Sons of Liberty , thought to have 300,000 members , many of them rich and respectable , and the planned uprising would coincide with the Chicago convention of the Democratic Party , which was then sympathetic to abandoning the war and recognizing the Confederacy . The unanimous court which freed Milligan for civil trial was a court of fire-eating Unionists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was one of President Lincoln 's closest friends . The Chief Justice , who wrote for the concurring minority , was a valiant supporter of the war , whatever his shortcomings in other respects . Yet the court had no difficulty in freeing Milligan , and facing down the outcry provoked by the decision . The court held in Milligan 's case that it was unconstitutional to try him before a military commission , rather than a court of law . There was little doubt of his guilt . But it was beyond the powers of the military to measure or punish it . The court 's vigorous peroration is worth recalling : It is claimed that martial law covers with its broad mantle the proceedings of this military commission . The proposition is this : that in a time of war the commander of the armed force ( if in his opinion the exigencies of the country demand it , and of which he is to judge ) , has the power , within the lines of his military district , to suspend all civil rights and their remedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of his will ; and in the exercise of his lawful authority can not be restrained , except by his superior officer or the President of the United States . If this position is sound to the extent claimed , then when war exists , foreign or domestic , and the country is subdivided into military departments for mere convenience , the commander of one of them can , if he chooses , within his limits , on the plea of necessity , with the approval of the Executive , substitute military force for and to the exclusion of the laws , and punish all persons , as he thinks right and proper , without fixed or certain rules . The statement of this proposition shows its importance ; far , if true , republican government is a failure , and there is an end of liberty regulated by law . Martial law , established on such a basis , destroys every guarantee of the Constitution , and effectually renders the " military independent of and superior to the civil power " the attempt to do which by the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offence . that they assigned it to the world as one of the causes which impelledthem to declare their independence . Civil liberty and this kind of martial law can not endure together ; the antagonism is irreconcilable ; and , in the conflict , one or the other must perish . VET IN the cases of the Japanese-Ameri-i cans the Supreme Court held the precedent of Ex Parte Milligan inapplicable . The reasoning is extraordinarily dangerous . The Japanese-Americans , the court said , were detained by a civilian agency , not by the Army . The program was not exclusively a matter for military administration , and it was enforceable under a statute by ordinary criminal remedies . Therefore , it did not present the question of the power of military tribunals to conduct trials under the laws of war . But the Japanese-Americans were ordered detained by a general , purporting to act on military grounds . The military order was enforceable , on pain of imprisonment . While a United States marshal , rather than a military policeman , assured obedience to the order , the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the military police : the bayonets of United States troops . It is hardly a ground for distinction that the general 's command was backed by the penalty of civil imprisonment , or that he obtained civilian aid in running the relocation camps . The starting point for the entire program was a military order , which had to be obeyed . In Ex Prate Milligan the Supreme Court had said that the military could not constitutionally arrest , nor could a military tribunal constitutionally try , civilians charged with treason and conspiracy to destroy the state by force , at a time when the civil courts were open and functioning . Yet under the plan considered in the Japanese-American cases , people not charged with crime are imprisoned without even a military trial , on the ground that they have the taint of Japanese blood . It would seem clear that if it illegal to arrest and confine people after an unwarranted military trial , it is surely even more illegal to arrest and confine them without any trial at all . But the Supreme Court says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case because the evacuees were committed to camps by military orders , not by military tribunals , and because their jailers did not wear uniforms ! There are , then , two basic constitutional problems concealed in the court 's easy dismissal of Ex Parte Milligan : the arrest , removal , and confinement of persons without trial , pending examination of their loyalty ; and the indefinite confinement of persons found to be disloyal . On both counts , at least as to citizens , the moral of Ex Parte Milligan is plain . A. FOR the Japanese aliens involved in the evacuation program , the consti- tutional problem is different . In time of war , the government possesses great powers over enemy aliens , which are to be ex- ercised , the courts say , for the " single purpose " of preventing enemy aliens from aiding the enemy . They may be interned if dangerous and their property in the United States may be taken into custody . Yet they are entitled to our general constitutional protections of individual liberty ? to trial by jury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of the per-son . Is it permissible to intern all the Japanese who live on the West Coast , but to allow German and Italian aliens , and Japanese who live elsewhere , general free-dom ? Surely the control and custody of enemy aliens in wartime should be reasonably equal and even-handed . T HE JAPANESE exclusion program rests on five propositions of the utmost po- tential menace : / . Protective custody , extending over three or four years , is a permitted form of imprisonment in the United States . 2 . Political opinions , not criminal acts , may contain enough danger to justify such imprisonment . 3 . Men , women , and children of a given racial group , both Americans and resident aliens , can be presumed to possess the kind of dangerous ideas which require their imprisonment . 4 . In time of war or emergency the mil-itary ? perhaps without even the concur-rence of the legislature ? can decide what political opinions require imprisonment , and which groups are infected with them . 5 . The decision of the military can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the confrontation of wit-nesses , counsel for the defense , the privilege against self-incrimination , or any of the other safeguards of the Bill of Rights . The idea of punishment only for individual criminal behavior is basic to all systems of civilized law . A great principle was never lost so casually . Mr. Justice Black 's comment was weak to the point of impotence : " Hardships are a part of war , and war is an aggregation of hard-ships . " It was an answer in the spirit of cliche : " Do n't you know there 's a war going on ? " It ignores the rights of citizenship , and the safeguards of trial practice which have been the historical attributes of liberty . We believe that the German people bear a common political responsibility for outrages secretly committed by the Gestapo and the SS . What are we to think of our own part in a program which violates every principle of our common life , yet has been approved by the President , Congress , and the Supreme Court ? Three chief forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first is the inescapable obligation of the federal government to protect the civil rights of Japanese-Americans against organized and unorganized hooliganism . If local law enforcement fails , federal prosecutions under the national Civil Rights Act should be undertaken . Secondly , generous financial indemnity shoull be sought . Apart from the sufferings of their imprisonment , the Japanese-Americans have sustained heavy property losses from their evacuation . Finally , the basic issues should be presented to the Supreme Court again , in an effort to obtain a prompt reversal of these wartime cases . The Supreme Court has often corrected its own errors in the past , especially when that error was occasioned by the excitement of a tense moment . After the end of the Civil War , several earlier decisions were reversed by Ex Parte Milligan . The famous flag-salute case of 1940 has recently been overruled in the decision of West Virginia v. Barnett . Similar public expiation in the case of the Japanese-Americans would be good for the court , and for the country ,           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
