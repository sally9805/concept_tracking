" Owoooooo ! " cried the housewives of Cerne Abbas ( Dorset ) , " here 's the milkman and me with the curlers still in my hair ! " No wonder they were fluttered . The milkman was Edward Kenelm Digby , 52 , eleventh Baron Digby , World War I colonel in the Coldstream Guards , World War II inspector of infantry-training establishments , co-grandfather ( with Winston Churchill ) of Randolph Churchill 's small son . Winston Churchill II . <P> For the past seven months burly Baron Digby has risen at 6:30 a.m . After breakfast his Lordship , wearing his habitual thick brown tweeds and checked cap on his bald head , steps into the stone-paved yard of his rambling Tudor manor house . Standing by the dairy is a neat , navy blue , electric van , loaded with Guernsey milk from Lord Digby 's 30 pedigreed cows , pastured on his 200-acre farm . Accompanied by his helper , aged Edwin White , Lord Digby hops in and sets off to deliver milk to the inhabitants of Cerne Abbas ( pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with milk , class-conscious housewives were somewhat embarrassed . Today the van 's super service and Baron Digby 's affable , businesslike manner have ended all that . Not only does he supply rich milk ( at the regulation fivepence a pint ) , but the van is loaded with vegetables , flowers and fresh fruit , grown on Lord Digby 's larger estate at Minterne , a mile away . <P> Says plump , bespectacled Mrs. Shuttle , wife of Cerne Abbas ' stationer : " He 's a real nice gentleman . " She describes how Lord Digby stands behind the van bellowing cheerfully : " What do you want this morning , Mrs. Shuttle ? " Mrs. Shuttle gives her order and hands over her shopping basket : " Then , like as not , he 'll say , ' Now do n't you worry , Mrs. Shuttle , I 'll take it for you , ' and he marches through the shop into the kitchen with the goods . Now there ai n't many people who 'd do that for you , lord or no lord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swank with them either , friendly as you please . And there 's no doubt about it , " adds Mrs. Shuttle , " he could sell that fruit at twice the price . I bought a peach from him for sixpence that would have cost me one and six in Dorchester . " <P> Even Sergeant Bert Clist , Cerne Abbas 's policeman , who has strong labor sympathies , says that the Digbys " are fine people with no side to them . . . . In fact I 'll be finding myself a die-hard Tory before long . " <P> Baron Digby turned milkman when none of his 40 employes could drive the newly purchased delivery truck . Now his Lordship likes to drive it so much that he wo n't give up the job .
