txt BEVIN SAYS SOVIET CURBS SATELLITES ON U. S. AID PLAN Charges in Commons Report That Moscow Propaganda Led to Big 4 Breakdown FORESEES GRAVE DECISION Paris Cool on ** Merger , Awaits Details  --  Marshall , Douglas Flying Home By HERBERT L. 1IATTHEWS Special to Trio NEW Emu : TMES . LONDON , Dec. ** Foreign Secretary Bevin spoke . of " taking a grave decision in the face of the world and the future " this afternoon in reporting to Parliament on the breakdown of the Council of Foreign Ministers . " We can not go on as we have been going on , " Mr. ' Sevin declared . His assertion came at the end of a statement in which he accused the Soviet Union of having ordered its immediate neighbors not to participate in the European Recovery Program fathered by United States Secretary of State Marshall , thus " violating the free choice of those states and interfering with their independence and sovereignty . " Mr. Bevin said he had left Moscow last spring after the futile ' meeting of the Council there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference just closed , but after the Moscow session , " propaganda developed which caused things to go from bad to worse . " Unable to Meet Problem He pointed out that Russia 's action in forbidding her satellites to join the Marshall plan was followed by the formation of the Communist Information Bureau " and the resulting disrupting tendencies in Western Europe . " Ur . Bevin said that despite this he had believed it still might be possible- to do business at the London session but that " hostile propaganda " by the Soviet Union " made it impossible to get to grips with the fundamental principles involved . " As his statement was being read by himself in the House of Commons and by Lord Pakenharn in the House of Lords , Secretary Marshall was taking off at the airport , accompanied by Ambassador Lewis W. Douglas and some top members of his staff . General Marshall 's speech to the United States reporting on the conference was virtually ready by the time he left . It had been prepared in the last forty-eight hours . More has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up than in the three weeks it was in session . Indeed , it was possible that a discussion of Germany at a luncheon at the United States Embassy residence today by Secretaries Marshall and Bevin and Sir Brian Robertson , British Military Governor of Germany , would lead to highly important decisions , although both ' sides were keeping mum for the present . The French Foreign Office reacted coolly to proposals for a three-zone merger in Germany , saying it wanted details of any such plan before taking action . When Mr. Sevin , at the end of his report today , asked Parliament to give the Government time to " study the problem as it now is in all its aspects , " he meant that the whole structure of British foreign policy needed reconsideration . However , there were no blueprints for the future . " We have not made any preparations at all , " Mr. Bevin told Parliament , and there was every reason to accept his statement literally . " We have no aim or desire to // THE SECRETARY OF STATE LEAVING FOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another point . A Foreign Office spokesman pointed tonight to three " grave decisions " that must be made in coming weeks : ( 1 ) What to do about the future of the Council of Foreign Ministers . ( 2 ) What attitude to take toward the Soviet Union . ( 3 ) What precisely Britain now would do about Germany . The , last question ' vas the one ' discussed and perhaps settled at today 's luncheon . Secretary Bevin ended his statement with this undoubtedly sincere profession : " We shall do our best to try , out of this difficult situation , to produce what I still believe is necessary  --  unity not only of Germany but unity of Europe and the peace of , the world . " Eden Sees No Choice ? These sentiments were cheered , but it was significant that Anthony Eden , who rose immediately to speak . on behalf of the Opposition . was able to say frankly what Mr. Sevin undoubtedly would have liked to say . " It seems to us on this side of the House that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in our power to promote recovery in in that part of Europe where we still are free to act ? in Western Europe , " he said . " We should set to work on that task as speedily as possible . I think it is in the interests of the world that we should take account of the realities of this breakdown . " Mr. Eden also said several other things that clearly were shared by all elements in the House , of Commons except the Commiihists and fellow travelers . He expressed sympathy for Mr. Bevin . General Marshall and French Foreign Minister Bidault in their efforts to reach a settlement . He endorsed Mr. Bevin 's emphasis on the necessity for backing General Marshall 's European Recovery Program to the hilt , and he put great stress on Britain 's disappointment at the failure to make progress with the Austrian treaty . More fire was thrown today on a development that had cast a shadow over British-United States relations these last few days . The United States delegation felt that Mr. Bevin left Secretary Marshall holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . General Marshall moved adjournment in the belief that the British knew he was . going to do so and fully supported him . The next day the British Foreign Office let it be understood that Mr. Bevin had been taken by surprise , and it was believed that General Marshall was angry . Today the , issue came up in Commons . Blame for U. S. Questioned " While endorsing a good deal of the Foreign Secretary 's criticism of the Soviet delegation 's use of this conference for propaganda purposes , " said a Left Wing Laborite , W. N. Wardey , " does he not attach some blame to the American delegation for the break-down ' of the conference ? " But Secretary Bevin still refused to relieve General Marshall of any responsibility , saying : " I am not praising or blaming . What I have said is that we could not carry on . " This controversy is puzzling because there seems no question that Mr. Bevin was caught by surprise at the precise moment General Marshall made his move . Mr. Bevin called over one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should do , which indicated he had not expected the move just then . Certainly Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov was flabbergasted , and someone who saw him off at the airport the next day reported that he seemed gloomy . That last evening of the conference , when all four Foreign Ministers went down to the bar for a drink together , someone present who understood Russian heard Mr. Molotov say over arid over again something to the effect that " this is awful . " Other Speeches Prepared It is known that he did not want the conference to end until today at the earliest , for he had other fine long propaganda speeches in his dispatch case . There was no tendency here to exaggerate the extent of BritishUnited States misunderstanding , and certainly Secretary Marshall left sincerely impressed with the British desires to work with the Americans and to back his recovery program . His final words at the airport this afternoon echoed those of all the Foreign Ministers : " I regret very , much . that we did not succeed in having a more profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we could not reach some basic decisions which would have done much for Germany and all Europe this winter . That is my particular regret . "
