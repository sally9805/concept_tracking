Pita TWO OUT midseason of 1914 , in my first professional summer with the Baltimore Orioles , Owner Jack Dunn saw that he couldn't. cope with the competition of the Baltimore Federal League team , and began to get rid of his stars to major-league clubs for the best prices they would bring . I knew a lot of clubs were after me after I had beaten the Athletics in a spring exhibition game . I had also pitched the Orioles to exhibition victories over the Giants and the Phillies . I knew McGraw was impressed with my pitching and had tried to get a promise from Dunn that when I was put on the market he would get first crack at me . Dunn had played for McGraw in New York , and Mac was so sore at Minnie when I was sold to the Red Sox that in later years he would n't even speak to Jack when Dunn tried to give him another Oriole southpaw  --  Lefty Grove . The way I got . it in later years , Dunn first offered Ernie Shore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were the cream of his team . Mack was winning the championship again in 1914 , but because of Federal League offers to his top players , he had a tough season financially . Mack told Dunn , " I 'd like to have those fellows , but I ca n't afford Copyright , NIX , Ili Georg. , Hero ... Both them , Jack . You 'd better peddle them to some club that has more money than I have and get the best price you can for them . " The Red Sox , owned by Joe Lannin , were running second to the Athletics that year , and trying to make a race of it . Lannin , who was a hotel man in Boston and New York , saved the International League during the Federal League war . He backed clubs in Buffalo and Providence and helped Dunn meet his pay roll in Baltimore . So Dunn , feeling under obligation to Lannin , next offered us to the Boston owner , Prior to that I had received two raises . After I started winning games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first month , and as I kept on winning after a second month , he boosted it to $1800 . When I made the move into the major leagues Joe Lannin gave me a new contract at the rate of $2500 . In the meantime I had received some swell offers from the Baltimore Federal League club . They offered me a $10,000 bonus if I would jump , and a salary of $10,000 . That was an awful temptation for a kid only a few months out of St. Mary 's . However , Dunn and the other people high up in organized baseball said that anybody who jumped would be out of big-league baseball for life . As I was a kid just starting , I was afraid of hurting my chances and remained loyal to organized baseball . But it was a big laugh about them keeping the jumpers out . After the Federal League quit in 1915 , all the big names who jumped  --  Hal Chase , Chief Bender , Eddie Plank , Bill McKechnie , Bill Rariden , and other guys like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing when they jumped . My decision to stick with Baltimore cost me about $30,000 . When I went to the Red Sox I got the same kind of rough treatment I had experienced in the training camp with the Orioles . Someone must have told them I was a fresh kid who did n't have much respect for big baseball reputations , and I guess some of the old guys let me have it . I suppose I did talk back , but not because I was fresh . I just wanted to show them I was as good as any of the other pitchers Bill Carrigan had . Carrigan was nice to me and told me early , " I hear you like to step out , Babe . But you play fair with me and I 'll play fair with you . " Bill had a lot of great players who had been on the Red Sox World 's Champions of 1912 . He still had his terrific outfield : Duffy Lewis , Tris Speaker and Harry Hooper . We later had a pretty sweet bear down every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather easily , four games to one , but the scores of our victories show that Bill was right . We never could let up a moment . Alexander beat Shore in the first game , 3 to 1 , But we won the next three games , all by scores of 2 to 1 , and then clinched it by winning the final in Philadelphia , 5 to 4 . I ate out . my heart on the bench in that series . I was the American League 's won-and-lost leader , and I naturally expected to pitch . I grabbed Carrigan 's lapels before every game and demanded to know when I was to get my chance . Bill later told me if there had been a sixth game , I surely would have pitched it , but we won the series before any sixth game was necessary . I did get one chance as a pinch hitter in the series , and for that I 'm thankful , because it gives me a chance to say I played in ten World Series . My opportunity came in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailing , 3 to 1 , Olaf Henriksen batted for Cady and was safe on Luderitz ' fumble . Carrigan then called me off the bench and said , " Here 's your chance , Babe . This Alexander is no tougher for you than anybody else . Pick out a good ball and hit it . " 1 did get a good piece of the ball and hit one like a shot down the first-hasp line . I thought it would go through Luderus , but he made up for his error on Olaf by making a great stop , and he beat me to the bag . That was that . Before leaving the 1915 Red Sox World 's Champions , I want to say that I think they were baseball 's greatest defensive team of all time . We were n't too much of a scoring club and Tris Speaker was our only .300 hitter . Many years later , Ty Cobb and I were discussing the Tiger and Red Sox clubs of 1915 and our many fights during that red-hot season . Of Carrigan 's team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that club ever had an equal , You 'd get off to a two-to-one lead and hold on like grim death . Time after time we 'd think we had a rally going in the late innings , only to have Scottie or Gardner come up with great stops , or ' Spoke , ' Duffy or Hooper pull one of their circus catches in the outfield . " We used to have a steep bank in left field at Fenway Park , and I can still see Duffy Lewis running up that cliff like a mountain goat , reaching out with his gloved or bare hand , and making impossible catches . I 'll always remember that . And during my first year as a Red Sox regular I felt rich enough and old enough  --  I was twenty  --  to take to myself a wife . She was Helen Woodring , who came originally from Nova Scotia and was a waitress at Landers ' Coffee Shop when I first met her . She used to wait on me in the mornings , and one day I said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hon ' ' ? " Helen thought it over for a few minutes and said yes . I began looking around for a home near Boston , for it had become my home town and I fully expected to spend the next twenty years there , pitching for the Red Sox . I won twenty-three games for the 1916 Red Sax and came back in 1917 to win twenty-three more . I knew what the top of the world felt like to sit . on , even though I was n't earning half the money which a bench-warming utility man makes today . In 1916 , Harry Coveleski , the big Tiger left-bander , tied my twenty-three wins , but I was the league 's earned-run lender with 1.75 . And ( luring the same year I got one of the biggest thrills of my life , and that goes for my longest home runs too . In a tough game with Detroit the Tigers tilled the bases with none out , but I pitched my way out of the hole by striking out Ty Cobb , Sam Crawford and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl Hubbell 's feat . of Inter years when he struck out Lou Gehrig , Al Simmons , Jimmy Foxx , Joe Cronin and myself in the All-Star game of 1934 . Every once in a while a young baseball writer will write that I was n't a pitcher , but a thrower . I read not so long ago that I did n't bother with signals ; I just had a strong arm and tried to blow down the hitters by throwing the ball past them . Maybe so , but how do they think I got that 1.75 earned-run average and finished ahead of Walter Johnson , Ernie Shore , Coveleski , Carl Mays , Joe Bush and Bob Shawkey ? What 's more , in 1916 the American League was a very tough league . It was just before the clubs began losing players to the services and just after they took back the Federal League jumpers . And the young writers just did n't know Carrigan . Bill was a keen student of the strengths and weaknesses of every hitter in the league ; whether he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " every pitch thrown . He 'd hit the ceiling if any of his pitchers tried to pitch his own game instead of following Bill 's game . He could get just about as tough as anybody I ever met . We did n't call him " Rough " Carrigan for nothing . I have often been asked to name the greatest manager I ever worked under . People kno-v I played for two smart New York managers who won a lot of pennants , Miller Huggins and Joe McCarthy . But I always surprise them when I answer , " Bill Carrigan . " One reason why I rate Bill on top is the way he kept the Red Sox up front after we lost Tris Speaker , our great center fielder and beat hitter , just before the opening of the 1916 season . Tris was sold to Cleveland for $50,000 and two young players nobody then knew much about  --  Sam Jones , who became a great pitcher , and Fred Thomas , a third baseman . It was a tremendous deal . Today it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Boston the year after he hit .400 . Some of us were talking it over and feeling sorry for ourselves , when Carrigan overheard the conversation . He broke in on us sharply . All right , we lost Speaker , " he barked . " But we 're still a tight ball club . We 've got good pitching , good fielding , and we 'll hit well enough If you guys stop your moaning and get down to business , we can win that pennant again . " I know how the pep talk reacted on me . I suddenly remembered that the $3780 check I got out of the 1915 World Series was more than my season 's pay , and I wanted another to match it . Without Speaker , we hustled even harder and we worked ourselves into another pennant . It was n't easy . Detroit fought us hard most of the way , but the White Sox , managed by Clarence Rowland , came fast late in the season and we had to go all out to finish two games ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no Speaker . This time we knocked over the Brooklyn Dodgers , four games to one , just as we had belted the Phillies in 1915 . I In Jim smiled at ill11ii me across the lunch table . " What , " he said , " you think New England is only interested in trustee accounts ? conserving property ? supplying working funds to established industry ... you think New England has no venture capital available for new companies  --  or for the expansion of old ? " The three of us leaned forward . All of us knew that I was kidding , when I challenged him , I mt yet I felt that sonic part of my remarks might he true . Then Jim let us have it . " Gentlemen , perhaps yon do n't realize how much money New England is putting into new and untried ideas , products and companies . Sure , we want to be darn certain that management , the product , and plant location and equipment arc right . But after that , you 'll find New England corporations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout New England . " And why should n't they ? " he continued . " New England is the most diversified section industrially in the world , because it 's got everything industry needs to produce SATUItl ) Vi goods and ! Hake a profit . It 's an ideal set-up for a large company that wants to decentralize or for ant progressive company looking for the best site . Power lines are ready to be tapped with no high-cost Imig-dislance connections . We have plenty of water for manufacturing . And New England itself , you know , is a ' , Try rich market ? close to the richest markets in the world , too . " And one more mighty important point about NOV England . " - , Jim was not smiling now ? " is that it inherits from its banking ancestry the sort of intimate and friendly cuunsel that means so much if you 're starting a new business venture , or if you 're established in industry and looking for alliance to expand . " VEN I I got my first World Series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith , a Georgia left-hander , against me , and we had one of the greatest . World Series balite:I ever put into the hook . Our fourteen-inning game , which I won , 2 to I , still is the longest of all World Series games . It . was so dark at the close that even the sharpest eyes on the field could hardly follow the hull . I was down to pitch the sixth game if there had been one . During the latter part of the season we had heard reports that Carrigan was going to quit baseball and go up to his home town , Lewiston , Maine , where he owned a bank . At the start , the players did n't pay much attention to it . We thought that Bill was getting ready to put the bee on Joe Lannin for a long-term contract But after our World Series celebration in the clubhouse , Bill shook hands with all of us , thanked us for the way we had served him , and wished us luck the rest of our playing days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I not only had a great respect for the man himself but I had a kid 's admiration for a great baseball general . I knew how much he had helped me , and I began wondering how well I would succeed under another manager . Not only did Carrigan leave the team after the 1916 World Series , but . shortly before Christmas Joe Lannin sold the Red Sox to Harry Frazee , a New York theatrical man . They 'll never build any monuments to Frazee in Boston . In fact , until Tom Yawkey rebuilt the Red Sox , it was n't healthy to mention Frazee 's name there . He ruined one of the American League 's great ball clubs by systematically selling star after star to the rich owners of the Yankees , Col. Jake Ruppert and Col. T. L. Huston . Frazee knew the theater , but he did n't know much about . baseball . He said once that no ballplayer was worth more than $8000 a year . " Why , I do n't pay any of my best actors more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry , however , and say that in his early years in Boston he really tried to build up the club rather than to tear it down . He bought the club on a shoestring , and it wasn't. until Lannin , the former owner , began to press him for unpaid notes that he started disposing of his stars . As I said before , I won twenty-three games for the second-place 1917 club , as I had done for our pennant winner of 1916 , and again was one of the pitching leaders of both major leagues . But I was lucky . I nearly ruined even my chance to appear in enough games to win as many as twenty-three . On June twenty-third of that season , in a game against Washington , I blew my top and punched an umpire , Brick Owens . It was n't a love pat . 1 really socked him  --  right on the jaw . I had pitched to only one batsman , Eddie Foster , the Senators ' lead-off man . Brick Owens called four straight balls on me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty years since then , I still insist that-three of the four should have been strikes . I growled at some of the early balls , but when lie called the Fourth one on me , I just went crazy . I rushed up to the plate and I said , " If you 'd go to bed at night , you so-and-so , you could keep your eyes open long enough in the daytime to see when a ball goes over the plate . " Brick could dish it too . " Shut up , you lout , " he said , " or I 'll throw you out of the game ! " I Its " Throw me out of this game and I 'll punch you right on the jaw ! " I bellowed . Brick looked at me coldly . " You 're out of this game right now , " he said , with a big jerk of his thumb. , I hauled off and hit . him , but good . Catcher Chet Thomas , our new playing manager , Jack Barry , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ban Johnson , then the Americas League 's president , was very easy on me . I was fined only $100 and KISpended for ten days . They 'd put you in jail today for hitting an umpire . Ben Chapman , who played with me on the Yankees , and Burleigh Grimes were put . out of the game for a year for taking a punch at umpires of a later day . In my three successful years with the Red Sox , I had plenty of fun and did my share of hell-raising , but often my thoughts went back to St. Mary 's and to Brother Matthias and Brothers Paul , Albert and Gilbert . I knew they loved baseball and were watching the progress in the big leagues of their ex-catcher and tailor 's apprentice . I recall my joy in winning my first , ' World Series game  --  that 2-to-1 , four- , teen-inning victory over Sherry Smith  --  and the messages from Brother Matthias and the boys still in the school with whom I had played . And I still treasure the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from Brother Matthias , and it read , " You 're doing fine , George . I 'm proud of you . " I had kept in doge contact with the school , and even then , before I was in the important money , had sent it some contributions . I wanted it to share in my new prosperity . The kids I left behind took on a new importance for me , and I guess that feeling was the beginning of what smarter fellows than I call a social consciousness . But all I knew then , and , for that matter , now , is that there is nothing in this country as important as our kids . Kids happen to like me , feel natural around me . I 'm the same around them . It is n't just a case of giving out autographs . I 've always felt cleaner after a session with kids . Wherever they 've gathered , they 've turned my thoughts back to St. Mary 's and my early days in that institution . At the start of my baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are now . They just hung around hall-park entrances to stare , bug-eyed , at the big leaguers . If you gave them a friendly pat on the back or said , " Hello , kid , " it made them happy . I suppose that 's how I came to greet everybody , " Hello , kid , " in my later years . When it came to remembering names , whether of ballplayers , sports or fans , I was no Jim F During the winter of 1917-1918 many of the Red Sox went into uniform . Most of them picked the Navy , including Manager Jack Barry . I was deferred as a married man , got into a National Guard unit and kept playing . Barry 's enlistment put Frazee into quite a spot . He had lost Carrigan shortly after buying the club a year before , and now he again found it necessary to dig up a new manager . The manager he finally dug up was Ed Barrow , a fellow who was to have a lot to do with making an outfielder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
