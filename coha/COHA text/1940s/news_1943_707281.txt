txt The Sicilian campaign ended at dawn today when patrols of the American Third Division entered Messina , to find it deserted by the Germans . Only a few snipers remained . Three hours later the British patrols , followed by tanks that had been held back by demolitions , entered Messina from the south . The Germans deserve credit for having fought skillfully and tenaciously throughout They left a minimum of material and men to bee captured . However , their divisions had - been severely mauled , particularly Troina , so it is doubtful whether they got away . Withmapst oftheir strength .. The end came suddenly - antral : most tamely . It had been foreseen , but it was always possible for the Germans to make a final delaying stand . Contact with them had been lost at dusk last night and units of our Third Division began pressing up the road that goes across the ridge straight to Messina , as well as the coastal road that makes a great loop .

The all but full moon was an extraordinary blessing for everybody but the Germans . It gave , a , ebaracter of unreality to that last exhilarating chase of hundreds of vehicles bearing men who longed to be in at the kill . Our jeep drove through a mythical , misty world , peopled by the ghosts of dead villages . Trucks and men loomed like monsters . Lightning flashes from our cannon added an extra touch of horror to the wrecked rows of houses . High up on the ridge the brush fires started by our artillery during afternoon drew us toward them like beacon lights . At a by-road on the coast an M. P. stopped our car , saying : " No smoking . Keep very quiet . Go slow . " Our artillery had done wonders in the past few days . We passed dozens of wrecked vehicles of all kinds . Several were still smoking . At Gesso we looked back at that famous panorama along the coast where the Third Division had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon we were stopped . At one curve an M. P. said " Take it easy . " He should have said more , for as we rounded the curve we suddenly found a chasm yawning below us . It was a German demolition . There we had to leave our jeep for a while and go on foot to the crossroads on the ridge . A sentry told us there that we could go no farther . Patrols had been sent down and had been fired on . Besides there was an even more serious demolition a few miles down the road . It was clear that Messina could not be taken until dawn , so we lay down to sleep . The hills were full of American troops . They kept filing along and deploying into the open country . A bulldozer tackled that bad demolition point just after dawn but we did not wait for it . A platoon was ordered to go down the road and keep going until it either met resistance or entered Messina . We joined it , thus starting ant eightmile trek that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had no means of knowing it at the time , at least three American patrols were already entering the last Sicilian city . Each had started from a different point between 2:30 and 3 A. M. , with orders to reconnoiter as far as it could go . These were the third reconnaissance group of the Third Division , commanded by Lieut . William B. Gunter of Commerce , Ga . His unit had been consistently in the vanguard . Then there was Company L , Third Battalion of Infantry , also of the Third Division , which had sent a platoon ahead under Lieut . Ralph J. Yates of Austin , Tex . On the way down he was joined by six men of a headquarters company led by Lieut . Jeff of Lubbock , Texas . It is impossible to say which of them got in first , and it does not NEWS BULLETINS by The New Y ork Times over Station W MCA570 on the dial . Every hour on the hour 8 A.M. through 11 P.M. matter . It is also likely that a patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time . However , there can be no question which division is to get credit from history for the capture of Messina . It was the Third Division , and the men hall earned it . As the platoon wail which I was neared the city , we began coming on civilians . We were the first to go down that road , so we were greeted as conquerors . I stopped often at first to talk with the Italians and relay what information they gave me to the lieutenant . They all insisted that the Germans had left . This later proved true . The last shells had been fired from a hill on the outskirts of the city yesterday afternoon . Then the guns had been unlimbered and taken down to the port and across to the mainland . None of the Italians saw any Germans after dusk . From high up on the ridge at dawn I had seen two little boats cross-to San Giovanni . A car containing two Italian generals , followed by a truck with about twenty other Italian officers came up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually all Sicilians who wanted to stay The other Italian soldiers naturally preferred to get to the mainland in the hope of reaching their homes . Lieutenant Gunter 's patrol had already sent back the mayor and the chief of police of Messina The people were as joyous as ever at the sight of Americans . Many spoke to us in English , telling about their relatives or their own sojourns in the United States . Grapes , figs , nuts and wine were offered in abundance . Often we were greeted with loud handclapping . Once an impromptu band of drums and trumpets , leading a noisy parade , came toward us . I heard one woman say : " The Germans were clean . " This was hardly to be doubted and the contrast must have been marked , considering the way that we had lived for the past four days . Anyway , to a Sicilian cleanliness is not necessarily a recommendation . There is little doubt that these Italians hated the Germans most heartily . Several soldiers claimed that they had exchanged shots with them at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking place at a merry pace as Italians went through their own grain stores . The Americans stopped it later , but much grain had gone by then . The whole lower portion of the city , around the docks , the railway station and the coast , was one long , uninterrupted , hideous wreck . There never could be a more effective example of bombing , for it represented 100 per cent destruction . As we went around we saw a fair quantity of Italian rifles , ammunition and machine guns . The streets of the city were strewn with wrecked vehicles . The British came in while we were there and were cheered just as much as the Americans . The demolition that they had faced had been very severe . There was nothing more to be seen . The battle of Sicily was over ? all but the shouting . As was expected , the Germans on the Calabrian shore , only a few miles away , began shelling the road leading down into the city . They had it under easy observation and had many batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they kept putting shrapnel over our heads , and now and then they would place a highexplosive shell on or near the road . As far as we were concerned , it was the Germans ' parting shot .
