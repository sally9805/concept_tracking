&gt; Football has been abandoned by 60 U.S. colleges . <P> &gt; Nearly every eleven has lost to the armed forces at least one regular it had counted on . <P> &gt; To plug gaps , 76% of U.S. football-playing colleges have waived the old rule barring freshmen from varsity teams . <P> &gt; The cream of campus coaches has been skimmed by the armed forces . <P> &gt; Night games have been dimmed out on East &; West coasts . <P> &gt; ODT has banned football special excursions . <P> &gt; Busses can not be chartered for team transportation . <P> With these war scars , college football begins this week what may be its last season for the duration . Among some 700 teams , the 60 absentees will scarcely be missed ( most famed : New York University ) . But most top-notch colleges , because of their Enlisted Reserve units , will not feel the war 's pinch this year . There are two scars , however , that may disfigure the 1942 season : 1 ) pock-marked coaching staffs ; 2 ) shriveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , football-wise , is California 's College of the Pacific . Its head coach , Grand Old Amos Alonzo Stagg , is a firm and vigorous 80 ( see cut ) and not likely to quit as long as he can hear the thump of foot on football . Among the first-rate coaches who have flocked to the Navy 's Preflight Training Schools are : Minnesota 's Bernie Bierman ( Iowa Preflight ) , Fordham 's Jim Crowley ( North Carolina Preflight ) , Southern Methodist 's Matty Bell ( Georgia Preflight ) , Southern California 's Sam Barry ( St. Mary 's Preflight ) . <P> Other famed coaches missing this year : <P> Duke 's Wallace Wade , Tennessee 's Bob Neyland , Nebraska 's Biff Jones-now in the Army . <P> Where head coaches have quit , assistants have often been shoved up . But who will take the assistants ' places ? As more &; more able-bodied forty-folk are drafted , this will be a thumping headache to most athletic directors . <P> Shooting Pains . Worse problem , even , will be transportation . Threatened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't get to the games , move the games to the crowds . One out of every five colleges has shifted at least one game to a nearby city . <P> Ivy-proud Princeton will stage both its Army and Navy games in New York City 's huge Yankee Stadium . The Big Nine 's Illinois-Ohio State game has been moved from Champaign to Cleveland ; Stanford 's games with Santa Clara and Washington from Palo Alto to San Francisco . Texas A. &; M. will tackle Rice at Houston instead of its own College Station . <P> For those who do get to football games this fall , there should be good wartime diversion . In the East , Fordham , Penn and Boston College should produce spine-tinglers . In the West , the University of California is favored to win the Pacific Coast Conference title for the first time in five years . In the South , all eyes are on the Georgia Bulldogs and Frank Sinkwich , speedy bonecrusher who made 15 All-Americas last year despite a broken jaw . In the Southwest , any one of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dope favors Texas University and Texas A. &; M.
