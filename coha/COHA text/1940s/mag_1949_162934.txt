The Malmdy massacre of captured U.S. soldiers , during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 , was one of the most vicious atrocities committed by Germans in combat during the war . By the testimony of one survivor ( who escaped by feigning death after he was shot in the foot ) , some 160 U.S. soldiers were lined up in a snow-covered field , eight deep and 20 abreast , and raked by machine-gun fire for three minutes . <P> The survivor heard the " agonized screams " of wounded and dying comrades , and single pistol shots-coups de grace administered by Germans who walked among the fallen victims after the machine-gunning stopped . <P> After war 's end , the Germans responsible for the massacre fell into Allied hands . Among them were two SS bigwigs , General Josef ( " Sepp " ) Dietrich , commander of the 6th Armored Division , and Colonel Joachim Peiper of the ist Armored Regiment ( known as " Peiper 's Task Force " ) . But most were youngsters whom Dietrich and Peiper had commanded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trial for the Malmdy massacre . All were found guilty and 43 sentenced to death . It seemed an open- &-shut; case . But the Germans ' defense counsel ( appointed by the U.S. ) , an Atlanta lawyer named Willis Meade Everett Jr. , had discovered facts which turned the case into one of the ugliest in the history of the war crimes trials . <P> Candles on the Table . Everett submitted an incredible report ( first to the U.S. Supreme Court , then to the U.S. Army ) , which read like a record of Nazi atrocities . He charged that , to extort confessions , U.S. prosecution teams " had kept the German defendants in dark , solitary confinement at near starvation rations up to six months ; had applied various forms of torture , including the driving of burning matches under the prisoners ' fingernails ; had administered beatings which resulted in broken jaws and arms and permanently injured testicles . " <P> He also charged that false confessions were obtained in mock trials , at which " the . . . plaintiff would see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning at both ends . . . and a crucifix in the center . . . The Germans were informed or led to believe that they were being tried by Americans for violations of international law . At the other end of the table would be the prosecutor , who would read the charges , yell and scream at these 18-and 20-year-old plaintiffs and attempt to force confessions from them . . . " <P> Blot on the Record . Everett was no longer defending the Germans , most of whom he believed guilty ; he was defending justice . For two years , at his own expense , Everett pleaded his case . Finally , last July 29 , an Army commission under Justice Gordon Simpson of the Texas Supreme Court was set up to review the records. * The commission corroborated Everett concerning the mock trials and did not dispute or deny the rest . General Lucius D. Clay had already commuted the death sentences of 31 of the 43 condemned Germans . In Washington last week the Simpson commission recommended clemency ( commutation to life imprisonment ) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not remove the blot on the record of U.S. military justice . It would remain as a terrible warning that , at times , the judges can be conquered by the forces of evil they are supposed to try . <P>
