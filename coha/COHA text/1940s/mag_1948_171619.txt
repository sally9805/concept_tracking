One night last week hulking ( 230 lbs . ) Rufus Stanley Woodward , sports editor of the New York Herald Tribune , was called on the carpet . When he left the office of Managing Editor George Cornish , Woodward was out of a job ( after 18 years on the Trib ) . Woodward had made the Trib 's sports section one of the best in the U.S. , but he had asked for trouble . He had criticized the firing or forced retirement of several staffers . And when the management asked what two men he could fire for economy , he had sarcastically suggested : " Columnist Red Smith and me . " <P> Woodward , who plans to spend his time finishing his book on how to be a sports editor , had his own explanation . Cracked he : " The Yale class of ' 36 has taken over . " ( Woodward is Amherst ' 17 . ) <P> There was some basis for the crack . Yaleman Whitelaw Reid , the new editor ( and son of the owner ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radio Columnist John Crosby ; Dick Pinkham , new circulation manager ; and August Heckscher , a new editorial writer . The new sports editor ( also Yale ' 36 ) is curly-haired , gregarious Bob Cooke , who once did a sports column for the Yale Daily News , played right wing on the varsity hockey team , was an Army flyer ( in B-26s ) during the war . His first official act was to assign himself back to the Brooklyn Dodgers ; Woodward had switched him this year to cover the New York Yankees .
