" Be prepared , " warned the London Daily Herald , " to learn from some military spokesman or semi-official syrup-dispenser that the situation in the Far East is scarcely relevant to the general trend of the war . Be prepared for the revival of soothing phrases about ' keeping a sense of perspective . ' Be prepared for reminders that , my dear fellow , the real enemy is Germany , and for suggestions that the war with Japan is little more than an exciting side show . " <P> These were typical of the angry , worried words which flew in the capital of the British Empire last week when it was learned that Singapore , farthest-flung fortress of the Empire , was in grave danger . But the warning was amiss . The Government dispensed no syrup . It appointed Alfred Duff Cooper , onetime Secretary of State for War , onetime First Lord of the Admiralty , onetime Minister of Information , who has been in Singapore for 15 weeks , to be Resident Minister for Far Eastern Affairs . He will have Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Commander in Chief Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham . <P> This was reassuring to the British people , who were a little shaken on Sir Robert . He had given them an exaggerated sense of complacency about Singapore by saying , in the course of 1941 : &gt; " The whole of the East Indies and the Far East are in a high state of preparedness for any eventuality . " &gt; " We are in a position to handle any war situation that may arise . " &gt; " As long as we are awake and Japan sees it . I think the situation will remain as it is. " &gt; " We have had plenty of warning and our preparations are made and tested . " * By contrast , Minister Duff Cooper 's first statement was neither sweet nor soothing : " Let us not blind ourselves to the gravity of the situation or the seriousness of the task that awaits us . Let us frankly admit that so far the Japanese have been extremely successful . " The Japanese were alarmingly successful : 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Frederick Roberts , once said that the history of the world would be decided at Singapore . By this week the Japanese had come within 300 miles of that decision . <P> The Japanese , big only in their fury , fought their way down Malaya on a miniature scale . The little men , in light shorts , open shirts and rubber sneakers , or with bare feet , were apparently insufficient targets for the British . As they had used tiny , steel-saving two-man subs at Pearl Harbor , they used in Malaya tiny one-man tanks and two-man gun carriers . The British even said that their doctors cut miniature Japanese bullets out of miniature British wounds . <P> Small though all the Japanese elements of attack may have been , there could be no belittling the results . In 14 days the Japanese had driven more than 100 miles through jungles which the British had complacently considered impenetrable . The enemy had isolated and driven the British off the island of Penang-not only a secondary naval base , but also the key to the narrow Malacca Straits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Japanese had also established themselves in a number of nearby air bases .
