" How about the third one ? " I asked . " I got him too . They could n't put me in the stockade , so they put a guard around me . I damn near went nuts . " He stopped and waited . He said it again . " I damn near went nuts . " He waited . I tried to put myself in his place . " If you 'd let them get away you 'd have been court-martialed , " I said . He snapped it out : " I was . " " Convicted ? " I asked . Suddenly he was sullen again . He seemed older . " Naw , they could n't do nothin ' to me . Charged me for the am-munition . ' " Ammunition ? " I asked ; " What ammunition ? . . . Oh . " I did n't like the way he looked . I went on quickly . " How come they charged you for the ammunition ? " " They always do that , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy 's family ca n't get you in the civil courts . " He paused a moment , and then he repeated . . . . " The guy 's family . . . " I took another Tong drag and blew it out . He watched me , and then he slouched against the doorway . " Soon as it was over they shipped me down here . " His voice was a long way off , now , and he was too . He was in the loneliest place aguy can be , I guess . He was at the end of his story . " While I was waitin ' for transportation out of the company , they put me in the mess hall and put a guard around it . Guys kept gatherin ' around . Boy , was I sweatin ' ! I did n't think I 'd ever make a rating . " T HAT was where he 'd started . That was where I came in . I took the last , deep drag on my cigarette . I looked at him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay away from him . It was that look in his eyes that I 'd called " sullen . " It was for me , now , and it was hate . I was another one . He 'd told me his story , and it had n't changed . I smashed my cigarette in the ash tray , and he turned and slouched out . Of course , now , I do n't have anything to do with him . He hates me , and I do n't want any trouble with him . I know how it would be . The boys would all be on my side . " That Croucher , " they 'd say , " that buddy-killer . " I could n't stand that . I keep thinking that if I really were any better than Croucher , he would n't have gone away hating me . After all , when you take the thing apart , all I did , really , was torture him . II . The Love Letter /sour three o'clock in the afternoon I was sweating in the orderly room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventory of the warehouse , and now he was standing around talking about going back to Oahu . He 's a short-timer on this rock . He 's on the third relief , and the second has gone . The short-timers like to rub it into us guys who ca n't see the end yet . " Quiet ! " I said , " Quiet ! Ca n't you see I 'm trying to work ? " His square , pink face broke into a grin . " Takes you eight hours to do an hour 's work . Why do n't you get finished like I do ? " ! " Quiet ! " I said . " Same reason it took you so long to get down here . Now you got six months yet , and I got two . " He 'd begun to let his hair grow so he 'd look good in Honolulu . It stood up in little yellow shocks like wheat . It made me mad to look at it . " You 'll never get off this rock , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sector Seven . You got dysentery now , but you 're so damn scared you ca n't tell the differ-ence . " He grinned again , and his blue eyes were velvet absorbing dreams of Hono-lulu . He kept talking : " Whiskey . First I 'm gon na drink all the Stateside whiskey , then I 'm gon na level out with rum an ' cokes , and then I 'm goin ' over on River Street . . . . " " That 's a fine way to talk , " I said , " I thought you were in love with Peggy . " " Aw , she do n't mean nothin ' to me . " " You mean you 've just been fooling her . writing all those letters , making her think you were serious ? " " Aw , for Christ ' sake , that 's just kiddin ' along . " I could see that I had him . I was messing up his mood . " That 's what I wanted to know , " I said . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been waiting to hear you say that . I 'm gon na tell her just what you said . " " Go ahead . " He started to grin , but it worked itself over into a scowl . " I 'm getting at it right now . " I put the paper into the machine . " In about a month I 'll be getting letters from her and you wo n't . " " You do n't even know her address . " " I 'll get it from Leo . " I began to type . " He wo n't give it to you . " " He will when I tell him what you said . " " Aw , for Christ ' sake , you think Leo 's gon na go to all that trouble to get me a girl and then foul me up on it ? " " I can send it in care of Leo 's girl . I know her address . " I finished the letter and handed it to him . He read it , his mouth twitching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straight face . " You better not send it , " he said . " I 'm just telling you , do n't send it . " " It 's my duty to send it . I 'll make you a carbon copy so you ca n't say I put anything over on you . " He worked up a grin and went out . O VER in the shack we were lying on our bunks before supper . " Hey , Leo , " I said , " give me Peggy 's address , will you ? " " Do n't do it , " Fayette said . " He 's trying to foul me up . He wants to get her to write to him . " " No , I do n't , " I said . " That is n't it . I just think it 's my duty to let her know what 's going on , after you saying you were just kidding her along . I feel it 's my duty to tell her , that 's all . " " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious . " I rolled over and winked at Adolph . Adolph stood up . " He 's right , too , he 's absolutely right . Fayette 's got no right to fool a nice girl like that . " Fayette glared at Adolph , and I looked over and winked at Leo . Leo rolled over on his elbow . " I did n't know he felt that way about it . Peggy 's my girl 's best friend . I would n't have got her to write to him if I 'd known he was just going to fool around . " " Casey better worry a little about his health , " Fayette said . " I 'd be a coward , " I said , " if I let threats keep me from doing what I think is my duty . " " You 're a goddam idiot ! You act like a goddam woman ! " he said . Leo and Adolph and the Chick laughed , and I roiled over and put my face in my pillow . When we went over to chow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat down with us . We started talking very seriously about the letter . Fayette finished in a hurry and got up and came over to me . " You better send a picture home , " he said , " because if you send that letter you are n't gon na look the same any more . " I shrugged my shoulders , and he turned and went out . The boys looked at me , and that was where the joke ended . Fayette was n't fooling . I could n't do anything as silly as to send the letter , but now I had to save my face . The more I thought about it the more amazed I was that he really thought I 'd send it . Fayette was n't a dumb guy , and I figured he knew me better than that . I thought back over the months on the rock , and I knew he knew me better than that . Evidently just the slight possibility that I 'd send it had him scared . After chow we all got aboard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't speaking to me . There was quite a long wait for the picture , and I could see that he was miserable . I wondered how he could be so knocked out about a girl in the States that he 'd never even seen . He must know that those girls that write to lonely soldiers are only building dreams because they believe they 're keeping up morale and helping the war effort . I thought that , and then it began to seep into me : Guys in a place like this live on dreams , dreams of home  --  it felt like ice water seeping into me . Since I 'd been on the rock Fayette had got only one letter from home , and that was the one from his aunt telling him that his mother had disappeared a year before . He had a brother in the Navy . I remembered how he had lain on his bunk and moaned to the rafters . " You 'll get a furlough , " we 'd all told him . " You 'll get a furlough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't want to go home , " he had moaned . " I do n't give a damn about my mother . She walked out on my father . How do you think he feels ? You think he wants to see me come walkin ' in there ? " I remembered that , and I knew that he had no dream of home . He was always dreaming of something , though . He was always talking about furloughs , and then Leo had hatched the idea of the two of them getting a furlough together , and introduced him to Peggy through the mail . That was a wild idea , but not too wild for Fayette . I looked across Leo , Adolph , and the Chick at him , sitting with his jaws in his hands , not talking . The hell with saving face . I reached into my pocket to get the letter . T HE loudspeaker began to scratch , and everybody straightened up . The voice came out clearly : " Attention , everybody , all officers , all men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a drill ; this is the real McCoy . There is a strong possibility of a commando raid on this island tonight . Leave the theater in an orderly manner , return to your units , and take orders from your company com-manders . " There was a rise in pitch of the usual murmur of voices , and a few cowboy yells , and the men rose and left the theater more hurriedly than usual . Standing in the truck going back , the Chick was chirping like a bird , " This is it ! This is it ! " He seemed happy about it . Fayette was disgusted . " For Christ ' sake , " he told the Chick , " wise up . It 's the same old malarkey . They 're always getting everybody excited over nothing . " He ca n't stay in one mood very long , and this was his chance to get out of his gloom . Back in the shack we checked our rifles and bayonets . " Aw , for Christ ' sake , " Fayette said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be silly , " I said . " We have to wait for orders . You think they made that announcement just for fun ? " " They just do those things to scare us , to keep us on the ball . " " They did a good job on me , " I said . " I 'm scared , " Adolph said . " I admit it . " " Me too ! " the Chick piped . " I 'm plenty scared . I ca n't forget Pearl Harbor ! " " Aw , for Christ ' sake , Chick , wise up ! " Fayette said . " I had it just as bad as you did at Pearl Harbor . " He got on his bunk and stretched out and left his equipment lying on the floor . We got orders to sleep with our clothes on , and when I woke somebody outside was yelling " Alert . " I went outside . A plane in the sky droned with an unfamiliar sound . " Sounds like a strange plane , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chick said . " I could tell that sound anytime . Let 's get in the trench . " We were all out but Fayette . I went into the shack . " Hey , Fayette , let 's go . " " Hell with it , " he said . " There 's a Jap plane up there , " I told him . " Commandos in airplanes , " he said . " Do n't make me laugh . " I went out to the long trench about twenty yards from the shack , and dropped in at the nearest end . There was a line of men to the other end , crouched quietly . Nobody near me was talking . Lieutenant Dusette appeared in front of the trench and stopped . " The men in this trench , " he said , " will watch the lagoon , in case they come in through the channel , " and then he disappeared . Ruger , a tall , milk-haired Texan , was next to me . He was lining his extra clips of ammunition along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and straining his eyes toward the lagoon . I started to do thesame . A flare went up over the channel , and a searchlight beam started sweeping back and forth across the lagoon mouth . I looked toward the shack and saw Fayette jogging over the coral toward the trench . " Fayette ! " I said . " Right here ! Right here ! " It felt like a dream , when you try to say something and your throat works but no voice sounds ; but he heard me and dropped into the trench . He was grinning . My throat felt dry , and my legs were shaking . " Looks like they 're comin ' in through the channel , " Fayette said . " Yeah . " " They wo n't make it , " he said . " Nothin ' to worry about . Let me have a look at that letter , will you ? " I got the letter from my pocket and handed it to him . " You think I was going to send it ? " I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You think I 'm an idiot ? " " Yes , " I said . I looked at him quickly and then back toward the lagoon , and I caught a sort of sheepish grin on his face . " You got a wife , " he said . " Everybody 's got ta be an idiot about something .
