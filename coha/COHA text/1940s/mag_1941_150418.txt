Last week was only Leon Henderson 's fourth as head of OPACS . Yet prices , Leon 's prime concern , rose more ominously than in any other week in months . Signs : <P> &gt; Imported commodities like rubber and tin rose because ships are scarce . Rubber reached a new high of 24 a pound , nearly 30% over this year 's low and almost 5 above the limit at which RFC can buy for stockpile . Straits tin sold at 52 a pound , up in a week . Tin prices are below the 1941 top , but they are still so high the Metals Reserve Co. has not bought a pound in three months . <P> &gt; Agricultural commodities rose because of the Fulmer bill , which aims to carve out a bigger piece of the national income for farmers by increasing crop loans . Cotton rose $3 a bale to four-year highs ; wheat rose 3 a bushel . Buyers scrambled for fats and oils . At 36# &162; a pound , butter was 20% over the January low . Lard fetched $9.72 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> This week Secretary of Agriculture Claude Wickard , instead of attacking the Fulmer bill , deplored " speculation " and announced plans were being made to tighten Government control of the commodity markets . Cotton and wheat prices promptly lost part of their gains . <P> &gt; Consumer goods rose because of general prosperity and the fear of shortages . Average used-car prices , according to Automotive News , have soared by $50 in six months , are now $486 for 1937-40 sedans ( all makes ) . The National Industrial Conference Board 's cost-of-living index for April reached 86.9 ( 1923 = 100 ) , highest in three years . <P> All this meant that Henderson 's price-controlling job was tough and getting tougher . Rising crop prices mean more money for farmers . On the industrial front many factory workers have had their pay upped 5% to 20% since New Year 's . When this Niagara of dollars starts gushing from farmer-labor pockets , many a price cap is likely to blow off .               @ @ @ @ @ @
