The Allies made a sharp counterattack against Argentine censorship last week . The sally was led by Colonel Sosthenes Behn , president of the potent International Telephone and Telegraph Corp . Argentina had ordered suspension for 24 hours of I.T . &; T. 's All America Cables for the crime of transmitting a cable from Mexico to Argentina 's President Edelmiro Farrell ( the cable protested the deportation of an anti-Franco Spaniard to presumed death in Spain ) . <P> Colonel Behn responded with a stiff protest . Obviously , all Allied-controlled communications might voluntarily shut down , thus leaving Argentina isolated . President Farrell 's Government rescinded its order . <P> But Argentina 's press was cringing before the Farrell regime . The great La Prensa was in a meek mood after its five-day suspension ( TIME , May 8 ) . La Nation , the No. 2 paper , last week averted a threatened eight-day suspension by apologizing for a mildly critical article and firing its author .                   @ @
