In the back of the room sat a quiet young Negro , listening while the others talked . It was during the depression , and almost every day Harlem 's WPA Art Center was crammed with artists and writers . " It was my education , " says Jacob Lawrence . " I met people like Saroyan before he got famous . They all used to talk about what was going on in the world . Not only about art , but everything . " <P> Young Jacob Lawrence was shy , but he felt at home ; he had long ago decided to become a painter . His mother had encouraged him when he was still a kid : " It kept me off the streets . " Within a few years , his flaming , semi-abstract pictures of Negro life hung in half a dozen top U.S. museums , and won him three Rosenwald fellowships . Only 30 now , Jacob Lawrence is the nation 's No. 1 Negro artist . <P> Last week , Manhattan gallerygoers saw a series of 14 war paintings by Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war he had been a petty officer in the Coast Guard aboard a troop transport , had used anything and everything he had seen as his subject : departure , return , alerts , men in bunks , cooks cooking ( " The cooks might not like my paintings , but they appreciated that I was painting a cook " ) . The pictures he exhibited last week were patterned with the crude simplicity of a poster ; his people angular , always distorted ; his colors somber , often murky . But the moods he created were sure : the loneliness of a woman reading a letter from overseas , the tortured plunge into battle , the exhausted letdown of victory . It took him just under a year to do the series , working regularly ( " good painters are never flighty " ) and quickly , but only after long mulling . " I work long on the idea for a painting , " says he . " I want the idea to strike right away . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
