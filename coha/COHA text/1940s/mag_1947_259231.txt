In the last 30 years , Marshal of the R.A.F. Sir Arthur Harris has progressed from attacking Iraqi and Indian tribes men in a bailing-wire kite to crumpling the huge Nazi war machine with his powerful , purring Bomber Command . <P> Fortnight ago , in one of the first books to be published by one of Britain 's service chiefs ( Bomber Offensive ; Collins , Lon don ) , the pink-mustached , apoplectic " Bomber " flew back over his career , then scattered some incendiaries closer to home . <P> Some were duds , but others might burn brightly . <P> Roared angry Sir Arthur , the strategy required to defeat the Germans was minuscule compared to the strategy required at home to allow him to beat the Germans . With few kindly words for anyone ( exceptions : Churchill , Eisenhower , Marshal of the R.A.F. Lord Portal ) , he rates the enemies of Bomber Command as : 1 ) the Royal Navy ; 2 ) the British Army ; 3 ) the German air force ; 4 ) British civil service ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Archibald Sinclair , " who went cap in hand to the other services , " came the German Army and Sweden. * <P> His solution : abolish all three services , have one defense force more &; more dependent on science , " which would show no more regret when it relinquishes an older weapon than a scientist shows when a hypothesis is exploded . " <P> In his haste to consign the airplane to obsolescence , Sir Arthur harrumphed that the atomic bomb does not even necessarily have to be carried by anything resembling a missile ( much less aircraft ) . " There is no reason why the parts of an atomic bomb . . . should not be brought in bit by bit by seemingly innocent people and assembled anywhere where cover can be found , in an embassy , attic , lodging or in a ship in harbor . " Many atomic authorities would agree . But his theory that " once a weapon is used it becomes obsolete " is a bit sweeping considering the long bow ( 1,000 years ) , the rifle ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months plus ) . <P> <P> His bitter conclusion : " I can not doubt that if there is a war within the next quarter of a century it will certainly destroy a very great part of the civilized world and disrupt it entirely . Perhaps after all that may be the best solution . <P> " The only alternative ... is world federation , a government of the world powerful enough to determine the policy of every country . " <P> <P> * " At the time when we were paying Sweden enormous sums of money for not delivering such things steel , tools and bearings to Germany , the Germans were paying enormous sums of money for orders originally given and then paying extra on top of that to have the finished products smuggled out to them .
