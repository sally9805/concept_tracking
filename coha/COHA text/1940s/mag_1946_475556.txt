FOR the past thirty years the Russian people have had a hard life . They are going to keep on having a hard life ? by our standards , bitterly hard ? for another ten or fifteen years . That is a great deal to demand of anybody , even a people as durable and patient as the Russians . The handful of men who run the country are no doubt reluctant to ask it ; but they feel it ca n't be helped . For reasons which were suggested in this magazine last month , they are convinced that another world war is almost sure to come . They expect it to be even more savage and exhausting than the last one , and they believe their nation must use all its energy and resources to get ready for it . In their eyes , another fifteen years of strain and sacrifice is the price which the Soviet Union must pay for survival . Stalin broke the bad news to his people on February 9 , when he outlined the postwar course of the USSR in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them then , with almost brutal honesty , that they had to set to work immediately on a new series of three or more Five Year Plans , directed primarily at building up a heavy industry ( that is , a war industry ) equal to any in the world . Until that is accomplished , he warned , the Soviet Union could not feel safe against another attack by its capitalist enemies . To drive the point home , he reminded them that he had been right when he had voiced a similar warning back in 1928 and had launched the country on the first of its famous Five Year Plans . At that time , he pointed out , " the Party knew that a war was looming , that the country could not be defended without heavy industry , that the development of heavy industry must be undertaken as soon as possible , that to be behind in this would mean to lose out . " . At the cost of great hardship , the country did create a heavy industry ; and it did not lose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , and with many of its painfully-built factories in ruins . Now the Soviet leaders are convinced that the same kind of job ? and more ? must be tackled all over again . J UST how bad this news was did not dawn on the Russians until March 15 , when the government announced in full detail the first of its new Five Year Plans . This document outlined a truly back-breaking task . It called for the restoration of all industries wrecked in the war , plus an increase in output nearly fifty per cent above the prewar level . It sketched the design for a steel industry which eventually will turn out sixty million tons a year , or considerably more than the United States normalty produces in peacetime . As a start , 104 rolling mills and 315 furnaces will have to be erected during the next five years . Within the same period the railroads are to rebuild the 9,000 miles of track and 1,800 bridges destroyed by the Germans and complete 4,338 miles of new line . More than 7,500 locomotives and 472,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , the Plan demands an increase in machine tools ? the very heart of a war industry ? up to a total of 1,300,000 , which is thirty per cent more than all the machine tools America was using in 1940 . The other essentials of a great industrial power ? coal mines , turbines , refineries , chemical plants ? all are to be expanded on a similar grandiose scale . This blueprint of Russia 's future makes no mention of atomic energy . Soviet spokesmen have repeatedly declared , however , that they expect to develop this , too , with all possible speed . Such an undertaking was by no means easy for the United States ; for the USSR , with far less technical ability in the chemical and electrical industries , it will be infinitely more difficult . Although Soviet scientists almost certainly have worked out the basic " secret " of atomic fission already , the construction of plants comparable to Oak Ridge and Hanford will absorb the cream of the nation 's skilled labor for five to eight years . It also will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such items as valves , pumps , high-quality alloys , and electrical apparatus , which are key components for many other industries . Finally , the Red Army ? the largest in the world ? is to be re-equipped " with the newest armaments . . . in order to guarantee the country against all surprises . " That will mean , to cite only one example , the creation of a virtually new aviation industry , since the Red air force has never had any modern long-range bombers and the best of its fighters now in operation already are obsolete . All this adds up to one bleak fact : there wo n't be much left over for the Russian people . It simply is not physically possible for the country to achieve any considerable increase in its output of consumers'goads , on top of its huge program of capital investment . Indeed the Plan itself makes that fact quite plain . The tight belt will continue to be fashionable in Russia for a long time to come . II 01-AHE Russian people know this , and I they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some discreet grumbling , because most of them still have an almost religious faith in the wisdom of their leaders . ( Those who do n't ? and I believe they arc relatively few ? either keep quiet or get sent off for a stretch of " re-education " in one of the political police 's labor camps . ) If Stalin says that another gruelling period of sweat and privation is necessary ? well , he knows best ; but nobody except the professional enthusiasts of the Party pretend to be overjoyed about it . Among the ordinary , sore-backed citizens , enthusiasm for the new Five Year Plan appears to be very tepid indeed . For these people are tired . Ever since 1914 they have been living under the tension of war , or preparation for war . During the past six years , in particular , they have performed miracles of labor and self-sacrifice . Even now in Western Russia , where I was working , they have to go on performing them simply to survive ? entirely aside from the extra burden of the new industrialization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kova she had just finished building a house . She is sixty-three years old , and she built it with her own hands . Her tools were a spade , an axe , and a trowel . Her materials were clay , dug in her own back yard and mixed with straw into a kind of adobe brick , plus a cartload of lumber which she picked out of the rubble heaps along her street . For the roof , the local secretary of the Communist Party helped her get a few strips of tar paper . It is a good house , as such things are measured these days in the Ukraine . It stands on the east bank of the Dnieper . River , among the ruins of what was once the main industrial suburb of Dnepropetrovsk . When the Germans retreated , they blew up its forty-one factories and burned all but four hundred of its ten thousand homes . Like most of her neighbors , Maria had to live in a dugout for nearly a year , while she put up new walls on the charred foundations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms , each about twelve feet square , and a little storm-porch outside the door . When I was there , this porch also served as a woodshed , tool house , and shelter for the family pig , which was penned into one corner with two planks . The furnishings were a brick stove , built into the partition between the rooms , a home-made wooden chest , a stool , and an iron bed which Maria had dug out of the ashes of the district hospital . A gunny-sack was spread beside the bed . On the walls hung an icon  - -  a bright lithograph of the Virgin and Child , with a gilt frame ? and a clock which her son brought back from Germany . Five pegs in the wall held the family 's spare clothes . Vassily , the son who got out of the Red Army about the time the house was finished , told me that he hoped to build a table and perhaps a chair if he could find enough wood . Another bed wo n't be necessary ; he sleeps on the stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her daughter , who recently came home from a war factory beyond the Urals . The other two sons wo n't be coming home . Maria had whitewashed the walls , inside and out , and still had enough lime left over for one coat on the privy at the far end of her little garden . She kept the packed clay floor swept clean with a twig broom ; her kitchenware ? a brass teapot and two large tin cans relics of lend-lease ) ? was polished to a high shine . Like most Ukrainian women , she naturally is a tidy housekeeper . Moreover , in the last twenty years she has been taught a good deal about " Soviet culture , " which mostly means hygiene . Keeping the place clean was quite a chore , however , because there was no soap . In theory , Maria was entitled to buy a hundred grains ? one small cake ? of laundry soap each month , but at the time I visited her the local stores had not been able to meet this ration for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soda , when she could get it , orscrubbed it with a special kind of brown clay from the banks of the Dnieper , which is supposed to have some cleansing properties . It must have , because her clothes ? a woolen head-shawl , bluestriped cotton shirt , and worn black serge skirt ? were fresh enough . She does n't have to worry about stockings . In summer she goes barefoot ; in the winter she wraps her feet with strips of cloth and shoves them into knee-high felt boots . In place of bath soap , the Tretakova household used the same brown clay , or a mixture of wood ashes with a little sand . Occasionally American toilet soap turns up in the street corner markets ? the merchant seamen touching at Odessa trade it for vodka and souvenirs ? but it brings as high as eighty-five roubles a cake , which is nearly as much as Vassily can earn in a week . F ROM the standpoint of privacy , the Tretakova family was better off than most of the Ukraine 's city dwellers . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person was supposed to have six square meters of living space . That means a strip of floor about ten feet long and six feet wide ? somewhat larger than a grave ? on which to sleep , cook , eat , and store one 's possessions . In Kharkov , which lost thirty per cent of its dwellings in the four separate battles for the city , the official allocation was 4.8 square meters . Even these space allotments could not always be met in full , as the thousands of refugees streamed back to their half-ruined towns . The result is an overcrowding which the average American can hardly imagine . If you really want to know how a typical Ukrainian family lives , pick the smallest room in your house or apartment and move your wife and children into it . Then pack in the beds , spare clothes , and furniture which you regard as absolutely indispensable . Knock off a few chunks of plaster and most of the paint , to simulate the effect of fifteen years of under-maintenance . Scrap the radiators and cooking range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises the winter temperature much above freezing . Break off the hot water tap in the bathroom , which you will share with several other families . Finally , invite your widowed Cousin Sophie and her four youngsters to move in with you for an indefinite period . If things seem a little cramped , console yourself by reflecting that you are still better off than many Russians . I 've known cases of four Ukrainian families sharing a single room . That , as one minor Kiev official expressed it , " does n't make for friendship , or even for decent living . " Even before the war the housing shortage had been bad enough ; one hundred and fifty square feet for each person was the best ever achieved in any Ukrainian city , and the average was considerably lower . Now it is causing more discontent , so far as I could judge , than any other single hardship . The authorities were frankly worried . Nikita Khruschev , the political boss of the Ukraine , kept an assortment of tiles , plywood strips , cinder blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table in his office , and he fretted constantly about UNRRA 's slow delivery of construction equipment . In the end I came to suspect that lack of homes , together with food shortages , might be one of the main reasons for the Kremlin 's reluctance to bring its troops back from the occupied countries . " When the soldiers come home , " explained one of my friends , a Party member in a job of considerable responsibility , " they are n't in any mood to be patient and understanding . They 've been sleeping in snow and mud for five years , and they wo n't even listen to explanations about our construction plans for next year . They just say : ' We saved you from the Nazis ? now give us some place to live . ' When they have to wait , they get restless and some of them become demoralized . " RESUM A ELY it was one of these demoralr ized young men whom my interpreter and I met one night while we were strolling through the quiet streets to the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly every night ; and if we ever were followed by NKVD plainclothes men , I was not able to detect it . Nor did anyone ever try to prevent us from talking to people on the streets . ) We stopped this boy to ask our way , and he walked with us for a few blocks because , he said , " maybe you can tell me how things are in other countries . " Also he obviously was eager to tell somebody how things were with him . Like many Red Army veterans , he was still wearing his uniform with the shoulder-boards and insignia removed . Both of his boots were split open at the toes and he had no hat . His father , a colonel , had been killed , he said , and he himself had been twice wounded . He was not interested in any of the jobs he could find in Kiev ? " they barely pay enough for bread " ? and he had no home . " I sleep where I can , " he told us . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a friend 's apartment the next . But there are thousands here who are no better off . I guess I ought to hop a freight train to Odessa . I have relatives there who may he willing to give me a place to live . Anyhow , it 's warmer than Kiev . " Such foot-loose , maladjusted veterans probably are largely responsible for the postwar crime wave which has plagued Russia as well as the capitalist countries . A whole division of cavalry had to he called into Moscow last winter to help the police put down an epidemic of robberies ; and in Kiev I was awakened two or three times a week by the crack of pistol shots in the streets . How much of this nocturnal gunfire came from the police and how much from trigger-happy soldiers on a spree I was never able to determine . It was never mentioned in the papers , since crime ? along with such other trivia as fifes , automobile accidents , divorces , and weddings ? is not considered news in Russia . / H UNGER , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Ukraine . Nobody was actually starving while I was there ; few people even look thin . ( Most Ukrainian women , in fact , are downright buxom . And either they are naturally endowed with the world 's most impressive facades , or the Soviet brassi &e; industry has a great deal to teach its capitalist competitors . ) Nevertheless , their diet is meager , unappetizing , and monotonous , even by prewar Russian standards . If you were a Soviet housewife , you would start your shopping early , both to be NO REST FOR THE sure of getting some food before the store sold out and because you would n't want to get your pay docked for being late to work . Nearly all Russian women work , of course , since it usually is impossible to raise a family on the husband 's pay alone , even though such items as rent and medical care cost little or nothing . ( The present wage of industrial workers in the Ukraine , as nearly as I could estimate , averages about 300 to 350 roubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American purchasing power . The new Five Year Plan aims to raise the average to 500 roubles by 1950 . ) Nor do the women always work at the genteel indoor jobs which are favored by the less robust and emancipated females of the capitalist world . Quite likely your job would be bricklaying , or grading roads , or shoveling concrete on a construction project . The first gang of Soviet women I saw at work were clearing four inches of packed ice and snow off the Moscow streets . Though the temperature was well below freezing , they were breaking up the ice with crowbars and tossing the chunks into trucks with their bare hands . u -- cic would n't have to bother about shopping around , because you could buy your rations only at the one store where your ration-card was registered , along with that of some two thousand other customers living in the neighborhood . Moreover , you could be confident that your store in this case , let us say , Grocery No. 69 on Pushkin Street in Kiev  - -  would have almost precisely the same stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ration stores . Except , of course , those shops reserved for the privileged classes ? army officers , scientists , teachers , doctors , pregnant women , and important bureaucrats ? which have a somewhat wider selection of goods . At this particular store , which looks much like all the others , you would find the show window nearly filled with a neat pyramid of American powdered milk cans from a recent UNRRA shipment . On top of the pyramid stands a bottle of Crimean champagne , its label a bit fly-specked and faded since it has been used as a window decoration for many months . It costs as much as you can earn in a couple of weeks , and naturally the turnover in such delicacies is rather slow . A colored portrait of Stalin , edged with ruffled crepe paper , leans against the milk cans . It is surrounded by hams , cheeses , and slabs of bacon , all made out of plaster of Paris ; their purpose is purely decorative , since such items have long been out of stock . As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small room lined on three sides with shelves . Wooden counters in front of these shelves and a cashier 's booth are the only furniture . The store is lighted by a single , unshaded forty-watt bulb , and its walls are decorated with large lithographed portraits of Stalin , Molotov , and Mikoyan , the Minister of Foreign Trade . Its staff consists of the manager ? a cheerful , stolid middleaged woman ? and four girl clerks . They are all dressed in headshawls , black leather boots , and white jackets like a doctor 's uniform . These jackets are clean , because the regulations demand that they be washed every night , and the shop is tidy and well swept . ( The sanitary rules are rigidly enforced . ) The brightest of the girls sits in the cashier 's booth , equipped with an abacus , the Oriental adding machine , and a money box made out of an old U. S. Army K-ration container . All the shelves along one wail are filled with square , unwrapped loaves of black rye bread , weighing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or about nine cents . There also are a few loaves of whole-wheat bread , which sell for twice as much . The rest of the shelves are almost empty , although a few packages of Caucasian tea and a small assortment of U. S. Army rations and powdered milk cans are spread out to make as brave a show as possible . Aside from the tea , all these items have been supplied by UNRRA , which bought them from American army surpluses . In one corner stands a barrel of sauerkraut , and on the counter is a two-gallon can of peanut butter ? also with a U. S. quartermaster label ? covered with an old copy of Pravda to keep out the flies . You can buy nearly a loaf and a half of bread for the day ? eight hundred grams for yourself , since you are a " heavy worker " on a railway bridge gang , plus six hundred for your husband who has a " light " job on the large bookkeeping staff of the State Planning Commission . You also are entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meat and a pound of butter or lard ; but you know the store has n't had any of these for a long time , so as substitutes you get a can of powdered milk and half of an army Tenin-One ration instead . Finally you buy a few ounces of peanut butter , wrapped in a scrap of paper , and a quart of sauerkraut ladled into the tin can you brought along for this purpose . All of this goes into the string net shopping bag which Russian women habitually carry . TouR dinner tonight , then , will consist 1 mainly of black bread and sauerkraut soup , just like every other dinner for weeks past . If you are an especially ambitious ( or hungry ) housewife , however , you will stop by the open-air market on your way home from work in hopes of picking up a little extra to piece out your rations . The market is simply two long rows of plank tables set up in the middle of a cobble-paved square just off the Khreshchatik , Kiev 's main street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them with a few bits of food spread out on a handkerchief or newspaper in front of her . This is their surplus from the little garden plots , usually about an acre , which are assigned to every family on a collective farm . Whatever the family can raise on its privately-held strip it is free to eat , sell , or barter in good capitalist fashion . After she feeds her own household , a thrifty farm wife usually manages to save up something to bring to market once or twice a week ? perhaps four eggs , a six-inch hunk of hard sausage , a crock of cucumber pickles , a raw pig 's liver , a vodka bottle full of sour milk , a handful of sunflower seed , or a string of garlic . Whatever it is will fetch a good price , because there are no price ceilings . Although it is perfectly legal , this bazaar is the economic equivalent of a black market . It sops up surplus purchasing power and provides an outlet for goods which are too scarce for successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the city dweller 's only source of meats and fats . ( There also are a few Gastronoms , or " commercial stores , " where the government itself sells such delicacies as caviar and canned crab meat ; but their prices are far beyond the reach of the average citizen . ) Since the total supply of all kinds of fats ? mostly sunflower and linseed oil ? averages less than a pound a month per person and meat is even scarcer , the farm women have no trouble in getting 20 roubles for a tenth of a pound of wurst or 50 roubles for a chicken . Even for a medium-sized carp out of the Dnieper River you would have to pay 35 roubles , or the equivalent of $3.50 . But roubles do n't interest the Russians nearly as much as barter . As you shoulder your way through the market , you will find that those American cigarettes in your Ten-in-One ration box , or the hard candies , or the envelope of instant coffee will prove your best currency . The chewing gum ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm women . It does n't seem very nourishing , and they ca n't understand why it should be in a military ration ; but somebody may swap an egg for a stick of spearmint , just out of curiosity . The little packet of citric acid crystals is practically worthless ? one point on which Russians and the American soldier apparently agree . You can , however , trade off the cardboard ration box , its oiled paper lining , and any empty bottles or tin cans you may have on hand . All these things have a well-established market value in the Ukraine . What the farm women want most , though , is clothes . Most of them are wearing the patched remnants of the dresses which have seen them clear through the war . Some do n't even have a dress left . Many a strapping Cossack girl comes to market in a quilted canvas overcoat , buttoned tight over a threadbare cotton undershirt , and a pair of home-made birchbark sandals . If you can spare an old sweater or a printed rayon scarf which some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade it for a whole basketful of food or up to two hundred roubles in cash . That apparently was what one old woman had in mind when she described this market to me as " the place of miracles . " " I earn three hundred roubles a month , " she said , " and it costs me twice that to keep my family alive . " She was miraculously closing the gaptemporarily ? by selling off her wardrobe a piece at a time . And she added : " We are tired of these hardships . " It was a phrase I heard many times . IV MHE government hears it , too , through I the Party officials who serve as its eyes and ears in every village , office , and factory . The men in the Kremlin are quite aware of the weariness , the discontent , and the universal craving for consumers ' goods . They also are aware that this discontent is not politically dangerous ? at least not yet . The tone of the grumbling is louder but not much different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortages and house-hunting ; it is not the kind of noise which foreshadows open rebellion . It does , however , indicate a lethargy , a flagging morale which could stow up considerably the tremendous undertakings of the new Five Year Plan . If it went unchecked , it might conceivably grow into another spasm of that sullen passive resistance which is the characteristic weapon of Slavic peasant peoples and which so nearly wrecked the Bolsheviks ' plans in 1920 and again in 1933 . Here , then , is the government 's main internal problem : how to keep the tired horse pulling for another ten years on the thinnest possible feed of oats . Nearly everything that is happening inside Russia grows out of this problem and the Party 's efforts to find an answer . One obvious answer , of course , is to show the horse why he ca n't have more oats . Another is to persuade him that he is getting quite a lot already , and that a whole bagful is waiting just over the next hill . The Party is trying them both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is I largely responsible for the increasingly fearsome picture of America which is being painted by the Soviet press . Unless the Russian people can be convinced that war is a real and immediate peril , they can hardly be reconciled to giving up the good things of life in order to build a great defense industry . Consequently , they must be told that the United States ? obviously the only nation capable of tackling Russia ? is becoming dangerously belligerent . Hence the familiar charges in the Russian newspapers that American " reactionaries " are developing atomic energy " not for the good of mankind but to its detriment as an instrument for oppressing and enslaving other peoples , " and that the Good Neighbor policy is an imperialistic scheme for welding a " dangerous . . . military and political bloc " in Latin America . These frightened noises do not necessarily reflect the real views of the Soviet government . Its fears of the United States are actual enough , but they are longrange rather than immediate . It realizes that , for the present at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atomic bomb in an aggressive war , and that our shrunken army is no longer a serious striking force . The rude language of the Russian press , therefore , may be taken as a rough measure of the Kremlin 's troubles at home . If they grow worse , the whopping about the American bogey-man is likely to get just that much louder . We should n't take this namecalling too seriously ; it is intended almost entirely for internal consumption . At the same time , the government is trying hard to make the best possible showing with the thin trickle of consumers ' goods which it is able to provide . In spite of some favoritism to the wealthy and privileged classes , the distribution of food and clothing is reasonably fair . It is also efficient . One UNRRA shipment of sardines was on sale in retail stores throughout the Ukraine only twelve days after it had landed in Odessa ? fast work in any country , and little short of miraculous in an area where the railroads are still half-crippled . The importance of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the occupied countries is indicated by the lengths to which the government has gone in order to get them . In the case of UNRRA , it made an unprecedented concession . It agreed to let a group of foreign inspectors travel freely throughout western Russia to watch the distribution of UNRRA supplies , because it could not get them on any other terms . In the occupied countries it has risked cutting its own political throat by its ruthless seizure of " reparations . " To the Russians , " reparations " apparently mean any enemy goods they can lay hands on , from an ice cream factory to German bicycles , radios , wine glasses , sewing machines , cattle , and goose-feather pillows . All these items , and many snore , were flowing into the Ukraine in a considerable stream while I was there . In Odessa even the trolley cars still carried the street signs of some Rumanian city . This process clearly is bad politics , since it must be hard to convince a Rumanian or Austrian family of the glories of communism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . But it can hardly be called unjust . Even if the Red Army stripped Germany and its satellites bone-naked , it could never make up for all they stole and destroyed within Russia . Perhaps most significant of alI is the fact that in their zone of Germany the Russians have built up certain industries ? notably gasoline , synthetic rubber , and optical goods ? to an output considerably above the prewar level . In theory , the USSR is committed to razing Germany 's war industry ; but for the moment it needs the finished products too urgently to bother about such theories . e-t-Aus Soviet propaganda machine is I making spectacular efforts to cover up the nation 's shortcomings in consumers ' goods , to persuade the people that they are well off in comparison with the capitalist world , and to assure them that real abundance is just around the corner . It is not always successful . For example , I was never able to discover a single item in the Russian press ? even with the help of Soviet librarians ? which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty million dollars ' worth of food , clothing , and equipment into the country . Aside from a few brief items about the comings and goings of UNRRA personnel , the organizationwas mentioned only in three highly critical articles about its handling of displaced persons and its feeding of " reactionaries " in Greece and Italy . The government obviously is reluctant to admit that it needs outside help to feed its people . Yet the Ukrainians knew very well where their UNRRA food , was coming from , simply because they saw American labels on every can and K-ration box . Moreover , they were obviously grateful . Time after time UNRRA representatives were stopped in the streets by some shopper who asked that her thanks be passed on " to our friends , the American people . " Indeed , the United States got more than its fair share of credit for UNRRA supplies , since goods from most other countries ? such as Indian tea , West African cocoa , and Australian blankets ? were shipped in bulk , and could not readily be identified on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely American . ( It might be overoptimistic , however , to conclude that the resulting good will has any great practical value . I was unable to find any evidence that the views of the ordinary Soviet citizen had the slightest effect on the Kremlin 's foreign policy . ) Similarly , the press insistently assures the Russians that they are the happiest people on earth . As Paul Winterton , one of the most careful students of Soviet life , has expressed it , they have been " deliberately hoodwinked " into believing " that in the wretched bourgeois states all but a privileged few live in miserable conditions of unemployment and poverty . " Nearly all news of America , for example , is carefully selected to give an unrelieved picture of strikes , racial persecution , and merciless exploitation of the toiling masses . As a result , one relatively well-informed Communist was franky incredulous when I told him that during the war OPA had been pretty successful in protecting tenants against unlimited rent increases , and another refused to believe that Negroes were permitted to attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Russian are chosen to back up this impression . John Steinbeck , Sinclair Lewis , Theodore Dreiser , William Faulkner , and Upton Sinclair are almost the only modern American writers who are widely known in the USSR , and the reader naturally concludes that the United States is peopled almost entirely by Babbitts and Okies . Nevertheless , some doubts manage to creep in . Whenever a Russian looks at a Dodge or Studebaker lend-lease truck , he ca n't help but see that they are better than anything coming out of Soviet factories . Moreover , he looks at them often , since they make up a good half of the road transport ; and he may wonder how a " decadent " country manages to build such a lot of undecadent trucks . In addition , a surprising number of Russian soldiers met American troops somewhere along the Elbe or in Czechoslovakia , and found that they did not look quite like downtrodden proletarians . The worst leakage of all occurred when the Red Artily moved into Germany and the Balkans . The troops then discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's underwear was more luxurious than anything they had ever seen . The result was a popeyed hankering for the fleshpots which all the efforts of Soviet propaganda have not been able to counteract entirely . V LL this makes it doubly necessary for the government to convince its people that their own supply of consumers ' goods is increasing rapidly , and that if they will only be patient a little longer everybody will have an abundance . Nearly every Soviet newspaper is heavily larded with articles about the rising production of boots , textiles , and furniture , and schemes for still further increases under the Five Year Plan . Some of these gains are tangible enough . Stalin has promised to end bread rationing some time this year . Such luxuries as buttons , safety pins , lipstick , and costume jewelry stamped out of plastic are becoming less rare . The commercial stores , where goods are sold without ration tickets , cut their prices this summer about forty per cent . A pair of men 's shoes can now be bought for $81 , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockings.cost only $12 a pair , men 's suits range from $160 to $400 , and gingham dresses sell for as little as $30 . Moreover , similar items sometimes are available at the ration stores , in limited quantities , at still more reasonable prices . In one material respect ? and , so far as I could discover , only one ? the Soviet worker actually is better off than he would be in America . He gets medical care absolutely free any time he needs it . The quality may not be first-class , since Russian doctors get less schooling than their American counterparts , and wherever the Germans penetrated , the supply of drugs and equipment is still sadly short . If you went to the Kremenchug hospital , for instance , you would have to bring your own bedclothes , you would find the X-ray laboratory still in ruins , and your surgeon might have to wait his turn for a pair of rubber gloves . Yet all the doctors I met impressed me as earnest , intelligent , and enthusiastic , and there were plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in contrast with American small towns ? have some kind of hospital or maternity home . As a result , the peasant undoubtedly gets more medical attention.than the average American farmer , and he never has to worry about being bankrupted by some unexpected illness . Perhaps it is not altogether accurate , however , to describe medical care strictly as a service for consumers . In the eyes of the government , manpower is primarily an element of military strength , and keeping it healthy is a matter of military priority , much like the maintenance of tanks . T FIRST glance , the Five Year Plan 's targets for consumers ' goods look quite impressive . Farm production is to be increased 27 per cent ; the number of automobiles in service will be doubled by 1950 ; 85 million square meters of living space will be built or repaired ; and the total volume of retail trade is to rise 28 per cent above the prewar level . Through the rosy lenses of the Soviet press , this looks like an impending avalanche of everything a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , leads to more somber conclusions . The housing program will provide considerably less than one square yard of additional living space for each Russian citizen ? a scant relief for the present overcrowding . A doubling of the number of automobiles will give the USSR a total stock which is only a fraction of Detroit 's output in a single year , and virtually all of that must be allocated to the bureaucracy , the trucking services , and the army . Private cars will continue to be almost unknown . Food supplies should be adequate by 1950 , at least in starches . But when it comes to such items as meats , fish , sugar , confectionery , wool and cotton fabrics , and footwear , the Plan goes suddenly vague ; it merely says that " the marketable stocks . . shall be greater in 1950 than in 1940 . " It does promise , though , that " the assortment and finish of fabrics , garments , knitted goods , and footwear must be definitely improved . " Even after that 28 per cent increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far smaller flow of commodities than that of any Western country , with the possible exception of Germany and Austria . It will merely raise living standards from the extreme sacrifices of war to a barely tolerable peacetime level . IT Is too early to argue that the Kremlin is wrong in imposing another decade or more of hardship and self-denial on the Russian people . If another war does come , these hardships would be a small price to pay for survival . If there is no war , then the heavy industry which is being built at such cost might eventually be turned to producing the good things of life . in that case , the next generation of Russians may enjoy a really substantial rise in living standards . This policy , however , has two important consequences for the rest of the world . First of all , it makes impossible the early growth of democracy in the USSR . The Russian people had no real part in making the policy ; and neither they nor any other people would tolerate it for a moment if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise and far sighted itmay prove to be , it is a policy which can be maintained only by a dictatorship , armed with an effective political police and propaganda machine . In the second place , it means that the Soviet people must be kept isolated . If they were allowed to mix with foreigners on any large scale , the contrast between the two standards of living would become impossible to conceal . Once even ten per cent of the Russians learned the truth about the outside world , the government 's propaganda would lose its power , and discontent might well get out of hand . Hence only the most trusted Party members can be exposed to the seductive luxuries of the free world , and every American magazine , with its advertisements of electric iceboxes and vacuum cleaners , must be regarded as a subversive influence . Moreover , if the rest of the world got a good look at Russia , the Communists would lose one of their most useful weapons ? the legend that the Soviet Union is The Worker 's Paradise . The Kremlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on short rations , but the example is not likely to make converts abroad . Therefore , newspaper correspondents must be kept immured in the Metropole Hotel ; their dispatches must be filtered through the tightest kind of censorship ; and visitors can be admitted only under the careful shepherding of Intourist . This means that the wall between Russia and the rest of the world ? with all the mistrust and suspicion which it entails ? will stand for a long time . It is not merely a Slavic whim , which can be charmed away by lectures about free speech and the need for mutual understanding . It is an essential part of Soviet policy ? an indispensable protection for its new series of Five Year Plans . We might do well , then , to get over our attitude of hurt surprise and learn to work with Russia as best we can on these terms . It will save a lot of disappointment if we accept the fact that for the next ten years or so , " mutual understanding " between the ordinary Russians and other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
