 | Well , it is time again to be planning Christmas cards and looking for Christmas gifts . It seems but a little while ago that we did all that and said , " Merry Christmas ! " to our friends , wishing it sincerely , wishing it , too , in our hearts for all the world . The calendar says , nevertheless , that the year is gone , says it calmly and unconcernedly , as though it had not been a year of which mankind should be ashamed , for making it one of the most tragic years in all recorded time . It was a strange year , too , for over its days there seemed to brood a sense of unreality , as if this were not life we were living , but a strange existence about which we could do nothing . Days that we did not wish to come at all came suddenly , with their news that we dreaded to hear and knew ? beyond hope or prayer - was inevitable . Perhaps we should be glad that such a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its record of cruelty and inhumanity and of man 's terrible capacity to destroy will never again be matched ; we can at least dream of a time when the things that we have loved and cherished through the long years will be given unto others , too . For surely if we as a nation could now play Santa Claus to the world , we would give the world what we love best . One does not ? at least , one should not ? give gifts that one would not care to receive ; still is it true that " the gift without the giver is bare . " So as Christmas comes to our land ? where no window need be darkened because of racial , religious , or physical oppression ? we shall be wishing that in all the world it were possible for those who believe in Christ to deck their Christmas trees in that faith , for others to observe the holiday in their own way . Freedom can mean no less than that ; if we do n't believe it , we have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we do believe it , and want for others only that which they are willing to receive . So into every stocking ? Belgian , Chinese , Czechoslovakian , Dutch , Finnish , French , German , Greek , Italian , Polish , Russian , and all the rest ? we would tuck a bit of freedom , good for all time to come . For we know these people want to be free , in spite of the things some of them are being forced to do . We wish it were indeed a " Merry Christmas ! " for all the world . But we can only wish that now and dream of the time when it will be true . Soon or late , that time will surely come , for that is the promise that Christmas brings . And the promise is not to a favored few , with all the rest subservient ; it is to all men , everywhere . It may seem like a flimsy promise to cling to now , with so much of the brute force of the world trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in the world 's history for such an effort to succeed . " One should remember that the defeated still have everything if they still have God , " says Father Francis in The Keys of the Kingdom . And God is still in and among the people of the nations that have officially proclaimed Him nonexistent . He has not forgotten Christmas ; He still wants it to be " merry " the whole world around . What can we do about it ? We like the way that question was answered recently by Wheeler McMillen . Said he : " First among present obligations is to maintain liberty here ? liberty for men to think , speak , worship , and work . Under the blessing of liberty we can show all the world the supreme example of human well-being in a nation where freedom , production , and patriotism go hand in hand . We can not hope to force our ways upon the peoples of the earth . But if we let the people of the earth see that we ourselves have devotedly adhered to freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life freedom from fear and hunger can be enjoyed , we shall most effectively fulfill our inspired mission to humanity . " " To maintain liberty here . " We shall let the whole world down , destroy its faith in man if not in God , if for any reason ? selfishness or greed or indifference or failure to pull together ? we fail to do that . We are at this Christmastime the Lope of the world ; we are being watched by anxious peoples and by no less anxious dictators . We have what the people want ; we have what the dictators fear . We have the right to choose our own way of life . We have the right to say , " Merry Christmas ! " to anyone we please . It is a blessing for which we should be very grateful ? and be ready to defend : it is hard to get back once it is lost . " Merry Christmas ! " to every one of you .               @ @ @ @ @ @
