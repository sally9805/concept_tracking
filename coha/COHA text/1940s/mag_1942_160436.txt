The same Berlin broadcast that told of the fall of Bengasi last week carried another piece of news . For his work in Libya , Adolf Hitler had upped tough Tank Expert General Erwin Rommel to the grade of Field Marshal , Second Class . <P> It was the second time in a year that Field Marshal Rommel had captured Bengasi , and there was nothing second class about his performance . The sweeping Axis counterattack , which ten days before the British had hopefully called an " armored force reconnaissance , " had swept around the base of the Gulf of Sidra , gathering momentum as it went . <P> At Msus in the desert Rommel 's armored columns had waited two days for supplies , then knifed northwest to Bengasi . As they came to the coastal plain the German advance forked into a trident . One prong struck the main road north and east of Bengasi . The other two speared in south of the city . <P> The Indian troops garrisoning Bengasi fought well against hopelessly superior odds , but the flat seaport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North African campaign began , was not fortified for a siege . Though some of the Indians escaped to the northeast , the Axis claimed that at least one battalion was captured . <P> Pressing their advantage , the Field Marshal 's troops began to move eastward and northward through the mountains towards Cyrene and Derna on the hump of Cyrenaica . By the weekend they had covered more than half the distance to Derna . <P> Though the capture of Bengasi was not a disaster , it was a serious defeat for the British . More serious still was the fact that within a fortnight Rommel had swept up many British supply dumps , was virtually munitioning his campaign at Britain 's expense . Most serious of all , the Field Marshal was apparently able to strike hammerblow attacks on land in spite of heavy strafing by a superior British air force .
