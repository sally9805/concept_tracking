Opium dreams , as addicts know , sometimes approach a revelation of the ultimate truth . In its book reviews Punch recently plugged a book called A Modern De Quincey by Captain H. R. Robinson , onetime opium addict , who was commissioned in the British Indian Army in 1915 . Said Punch 's review : <P> " His first pipe or two disappointed him , but he persisted , hoping for the dreams of which he had read . These came eventually and one of them , which recurred over some weeks , seemed to him to contain the key to the secret of the universe . With an enormous effort he managed one night to write the secret down . The denouement , he says , was disappointing , for on the following morning he read ' The banana is great , but the skin is greater . ' "
