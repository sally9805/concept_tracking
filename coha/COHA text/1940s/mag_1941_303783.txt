Two-Faced Woman ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) is a practically perfect example of how wrong Hollywood can be when it gets off the beam . A slapsticky remake of a 1925 farce ( Her Sister from Paris , with Constance Talmadge ) , it is an absurd vehicle for Greta Garbo , the Swedish nonpareil and the screen 's best tragedienne . Its embarrassing effect is not unlike seeing Sarah Bernhardt swatted with a bladder . It is almost as shocking as seeing your mother drunk . <P> Why this particular picture should have run afoul of the Legion of Decency , a Catholic organization which exercises the prerogative of deciding what pictures are fit for Catholic consumption , is best known to the Legion . The Legion decided that Two-Faced Woman was " immoral " ( TIME , Dec. 8 ) . <P> Miss Garbo is cast as an Amazonish skiing instructor at a fashionable Idaho mountain resort . She meets , loves , marries one Melvyn Douglas , publisher of a Manhattan magazine called Tides and Currents . Half poet , half Napoleon , he leaves her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he fails to return , Garbo goes after him , inadvertently poses as her own imaginary sister ( a fascinating international trollop ) and seduces her husband with ease . Everything ends slaphappily back in snowbound Idaho . <P> This withered plot permits M.G.M. to exhibit Garbo in a bathing suit , on skis , in costly modern gowns , in a new bob , dancing the conga , tipsy , etc . It supplies her with such dialogue as : " I was born old " ; " I like older men ; they 're so grateful " ; " let 's drink to what you 're thinking " ( to Mr. Douglas , who is unquestionably thinking censorable thoughts ) . <P> This is M.G.M. 's idea of modernizing Garbo . Perhaps M.G.M. thought that , because Garbo played a captivating brand of comedy in Ninotchka two years ago , she ought to go on to slapstick . But Ninotchka was played against a dramatic background . Two-Faced Woman is neither dramatic nor funny ( except for some hilarious stunt-skiing sequences ) ; it is a trick played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Now that M.G.M. has recalled its picture , deleted some double-entendre scenes and dialogue , revised one sequence to permit Publisher Douglas to discover early in the game that his sister-in-law is really his wife , the Legion may consider its work well done . It is not . The only good job would have been to consign this picture forever to the darkness of M.G.M. 's vaults . <P> They Died With Their Boots On ( Warner ) is two hours and 17 minutes of wistful , little-eyed Errol Flynn as General George Armstrong Custer . That is a lot of Errol Flynn . With the Civil War and another Last Stand as backdrops for his heroics , the swashbuckler manages to be enormously brave , dashingly picturesque , occasionally silly , without losing his beatified placidity or sweating much . <P> The Brothers Warner were even braver . Disdaining Hollywood 's horror of controversial issue ( pro &; anti-Custerites are among the most vigorously vocal of U.S. cultists ) , they sailed into the screen 's first full-length exposition of the Custer legend with all canvas flying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not likely to please either side .
