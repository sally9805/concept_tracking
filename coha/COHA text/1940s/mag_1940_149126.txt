The Ramparts We Watch is MARCH OF TIME 'S first full-length feature . Its name , and nothing else , comes from Major George Fielding Eliot 's treatise on U. S. defense . In form it is the fullest flowering of two arts : the newsreel and MARCH OF TIME 'S five-year-old discovery that people act like people , that the truest recreation of human beings is to be had by picturing people in the roles they play in life . <P> The story told by The Ramparts We Watch is that of a U. S. town and the people in it from 1914-1918 . It shows what they were like , what they did , felt , said , hoped , how they argued , worked , fought , lived , died , made war and made peace . It offers no special pleading , grinds no economic or historical ax . Its thesis is the belief that nations , like individuals , can not understand their present and their future unless they remember their past correctly , which the U. S. has a tendency not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning that Archduke Ferdinand has been assassinated at Sarajevo , asks whether an archduke is like a prince . News of the mobilization of 17,000,000 Europeans is like the story of a distant railway wreck , a fire in a house far away . Then one day Joe Kovacs gets a letter with a foreign stamp , from Austria , and his wife brings it to him at work . Joe Kovacs ' class has been called , his fatherland has ordered him to arms , and Joe must go . At the Plaza Theatre that night , sitting with his neighbors for the last time , Joe sees the uniformed man with the withered arm jerkily strutting in a newsreel . <P> The roar of the big guns is muffled at first , gradually grows louder in Sometown . A $5 bill will feed a Belgian baby for a month . It is not Sometown 's fight . But in a rathskeller , the song Did n't Raise My Boy To Be A Soldier does n't sound right either . Mr. Averill did n't raise his boy to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow Mr. Averill and Sometown are proud of him . Even the Bensinger girl , whose father teaches at the local college and wants his native Germany to win the war , is proud of Walter . To kindly , level-headed Editor Dan Meredith of The Day ( John Adair ) falls the task of giving Walter 's funeral elegy . <P> Then U-boat warfare , the sinking of the Lusitania , makes Sometown feel angry frustration , determined to do something . But Congressman John Lawton says there is only one thing to be done , and no one wants to go to war . As 1915 falls flaming into 1916 , this is true , but Sometowns over the U. S. look toward thin-faced , worried Woodrow Wilson , about to marry Mrs. Gait . When Charles Evans Hughes quits the Supreme Court to run against Wilson , and almost wins , a period in history is already drawing to a close . Sometown 's main street sees its first Preparedness Day parade , and in Washington the parade is led by Wilson himself . At Sagamore Hill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day are dying , England sweeps and Germany combs the seas , and Sometown and the U. S. lose their tempers too . The man who was too proud to fight begins to feel in his bones that the only question is When . The day is April 6. 1917.
