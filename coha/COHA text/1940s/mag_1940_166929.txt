Great is the Roman Catholic Church . Princes-and politicians-she has in plenty , and many a good priest . But her nearest equivalent to a great preacher is Radiorating Father Coughlin . Last week a son of Mother Church in whom she can take greater pride ( he , as well as Father Coughlin , counts his hearers in millions ) celebrated his tenth anniversary as a radio preacher on the National Council of Catholic Men 's weekly Catholic Hour ( NBC ) . Monsignor Fulton John Sheen celebrated the occasion appropriately , by preaching over the radio . His subject : " Memories . " <P> Lean , black-a-vised , hollow-eyed , Monsignor Sheen is a persuasive , lucid speaker , with a well-cultivated voice , who can make religion sensible and attractive to great masses of people . Though his official job is teaching philosophy at the Catholic University in Washington , he fills 150 speaking dates a year . Three weeks ago he did not let an attack of grippe keep him from engagements in St. Louis and Cleveland , nor a fever of 102 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan , where for the tenth year he was Lenten orator . <P> Born 44 years ago in Illinois , where his Uncle Dan Sheen was law partner of Agnostic Robert Green Ingersoll , Fulton Sheen made a splash as a scholar in Europe , returned to Peoria with an invitation in his pocket to teach at Catholic University . But his Bishop , instead of telling Father Sheen what a bright boy he was and bidding him Godspeed , put him in a poor , tough Peoria parish for two years . <P> That was probably the last time that anyone suggested that there was anything inadequate about Fulton J. Sheen . With the spread of the Catholic Hour ( from 22 to 95 NBC stations ) , Monsignor Sheen gets 3,000 to 6,000 letters a day , the Hour itself draws 27,000 a week , has mailed out 1,750,000 copies of Orator Sheen 's talks . <P> Take away Father Coughlin 's microphone and Social Justice and there would be little left but a parish priest . But Monsignor Sheen is much more than a pulpiteer : he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for instructing converts , he spends ten hours a week at this quiet , heart- &-soul; job . Some of his more notable converts : the late Hoovercrat Horace A. Mann and his wife , the late Heywood Broun , whom Monsignor Sheen baptized , gave last rites to and buried ( TIME , Jan. 1 ) . Monsignor Sheen is now preparing Henry Ford 's grandson Henry II for reception into the Church and marriage with a Catholic , Ann McDonnell . But on none of his big-name pupils did Monsignor Sheen lavish more time &; trouble than he did on a convert who brought him no temporal glory : his Negro cook .
