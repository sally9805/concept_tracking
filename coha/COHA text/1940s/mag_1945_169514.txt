The postwar car , kitchen and medicine chest will be new , wonderful , better-than-ever . Will U.S. schools and colleges keep step ? <P> Scores of recent studies have probed the past and suggested paths to a brighter future . From Maine 's little Bates College to the huge University of Southern California , curriculum changes have already become the order of the day . Last week , Harvard added its findings-and they went straight to fundamental issues . <P> Two Principles . " Teach youth a trade , increase his earning power , " say the vocationalists . " Help youth adjust to the complexities of modern society , " proclaim the pragmatic Deweyites . " Instill in youth the wisdom of past ages , " cry the Hutchinsites , flourishing their Great Books . Underlying all such panaceas are the basic principles of the world-envied U.S. educational system- " Jeffersonian " and " Jacksonian . " <P> Thomas Jefferson felt that education 's prime responsibility was to discover the gifted student and train him for leadership in his special field ( the versatile sage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem more desirable than Sanskrit ) . Andrew Jackson 's philosophy , on the contrary , clearly calls for education to concentrate on raising the level of the mass . <P> The Core Idea . While agreeing that both principles are essential to a free people , more &; more educators today are apprehensive that Jeffersonian specialism has run away with the show . But well aware that flight from the technological facts of modern life is impossible , few have urged drastic changes . Nor has Harvard , which comes close to the consensus in urging emphasis on a compulsory " core " of general subjects . <P> The core idea has its roots deep in the problems of U.S. democracy . In the most complex technical-industrial society of all time , American learning has spread out to encompass everything from electronics to eel husbandry-and the common body of tradition and culture that once bound men together is by &; large getting a cursory dismissal as " useless " and " impractical . " <P> The inevitable and dangerous result , as noted in the Harvard report , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of their special interests-just when the basic unity of free men is the world 's crying need . Few of the recent educational studies , of which Harvard 's is perhaps the weightiest and most comprehensive , have had a more provocative thesis . <P> Dangerous Delinquency . Titled General Education in a Free Society , Harvard 's report is the result of two years ' and $60,000 worth of study , research and consultation by a committee of twelve . <P> The words " Free Society " are not included in the title for mere euphony . Throughout its 267 pages the document returns again &; again to the theme that democracy is nothing but an unworkable , confusing dream unless its citizens share a set of fundamental traditions and premises . Their perpetuation , argues Harvard 's committee , is education 's prime responsibility . And in meeting this responsibility , the committee finds that U.S. education has been dangerously delinquent .
