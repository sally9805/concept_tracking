There was nothing really wrong with twelve-year-old Queens College . It had a tree-lined 52-acre campus across the East River from Manhattan , an able faculty of 225 , some 3,000 students and no real worries about raising money . Since it was one of the four independent branches of the College of the City of New York , * it could count on handsome support from the taxpayers . Queens College 's only real trouble was that for more than a year-ever since Dr. Paul Klapper resigned-it had not been able to find a president . <P> Last winter , it came close . New York City 's Board of Higher Education was ready to name Bryn J. Hovde , historian ( The Scandinavian Countries ) , housing expert and head of Manhattan 's New School for Social Research , to the $15,000-a-year job . But some Queens residents had a candidate of their own : Acting President Margaret V. Kiely . Others , including Brooklyn 's Roman Catholic Tablet , attacked Hovde because he had been critical of the House Un-American Activities Committee , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer ( where he had , it was admitted , made a stout anti-Soviet speech-TIME , Sept. 6 ) . <P> Even New York City 's Mayor William O'Dwyer got into the ruckus . He belabored the board for ignoring anti-Hovde sentiment in Queens " . Later , after public reminders that the appointment was none of his business ( " An unseemly bumble , " cried the New York Herald Tribune ) , he backed down . But Hovde withdrew his name from the pot . So , a short time later , rdid another promising candidate , Walter Consuelo Langsam , president of 1,200-student Wagner Memorial Lutheran College on Staten Island . On reflection , he decided to stay where he was . The board , which did n't care much for Miss Kiely , started its search all over again . <P> Last week the board found its man . He was trim , 44-year-old John J. Theobald , dean of administration at Manhattan 's City College for the last three years . Before that he had taught civil engineering at City College , supervised some highway surveys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the past year 's tumult and shouting did n't worry him ; he called it " a perfectly wonderful opportunity . " He thought he had been around the city 's colleges long enough to know his way . <P> <P> * Others : City College ( in Manhattan ) , Brooklyn College and Hunter College ( with campuses in Manhattan and The Bronx ) .
