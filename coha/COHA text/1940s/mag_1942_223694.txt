While the can't-do-it experts dug up more reasons why Henry J. Kaiser ca n't possibly build cargo planes , the big West Coast engineer found a sure-we'll-do-it partner . To his aid , on a 50-50 basis , came enormously wealthy , enormously successful Howard Hughes , speed flyer , technician , designer , builder , young man of vision , and a hardheaded businessman . <P> Howard Hughes , at 36 , is no amateur in the business , is an airman 's airman : holder of the transcontinental speed record ( 7 hr. , 28 min. ) , holder of the round-the-world record ( 3 days , 19 hr. , 8 min. ) , big shareholder in great Transcontinental &; Western Air , Inc . He is a first-rate designer himself , has a personal staff of technicians at work in his own experimental laboratories . He and his staff drew up plans for the giant new Constellation transport ( range 4,000 miles ; capacity 57 passengers , cruising speed 283 m.p.h. ) and Howard committed himself for $20,000,000 to get Lockheed to build them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaiser and his men , who helped put up Grand Coulee Dam ( largest in the world ) , Boulder and Bonneville dams , the San Francisco-Oakland Bridge ( longest in the world ) , are natural-born nose thumbers at nature . <P> Tall ( 6 ft. 3 ) , slim , shy Howard Robard Hughes is a rich man 's son : his father invented a high-speed oil drill , left a multimillion-dollar fortune . But Howard Hughes has never coasted on his inheritance . He showed a technician 's touch even in boyhood , built his own motorcycle and radio set , invented a pretty good shock absorber , got admitted to California Institute of Technology for special courses before he was old enough to enroll as a regular student . <P> He was 19 when his father died . He ran the oil-tool business for a while , got bored , began branching out . He and Cinemactor Ralph Graves produced a motion picture , agreed that it was too bad even to release . But he tried again , turned out two minor successes , then gambled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The picture made the late Jean Harlow the biggest box-office attraction in Hollywood - and made Hughes $3,000,000 . <P> When Hughes took up flying seriously , he first became a crack pilot , then worked as an American Airlines copilot , under an assumed name , to perfect his technique . <P> His speed and round-the-world flights were triumphs of careful planning : each added to his store of aircraft knowledge . <P> Cargo planes have long been a Hughes dream ; in one of his rare public speeches , after his round-the-world flight , he predicted that airplanes would some day supplant ocean liners , said that the aircraft industry 's future was " beyond the scope of the most fantastic imagination . " Now that Imaginer Hughes and Imaginer Kaiser are teamed up , Americans may possibly see some fantastic results .
