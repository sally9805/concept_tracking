Greeks voted in a crucial plebiscite last week . Nominally , they were voting whether or not to bring back King George II from British exile . Actually , they were deciding whether Greece should remain the only Balkan country uncontrolled by Russia , or become a Soviet satellite , as would surely happen if leftists won . At week 's end , not all the votes had been counted . But the result seemed certain : Royalist victory . <P> Both Left and Right were malodorous in Greece ( armed struggle between the factions left 50 dead on election eve ) . But Britain , and by implication the U.S. , were committed , in the nature of the bigger world issues , to support of the Right . Both Governments squirmed with discomfort , for both had failed to make clear to their people the necessity of their unpleasant choice . <P> It was pointed up by the approach of the U.S. aircraft carrier Franklin D. Roosevelt to Piraeus on a timely goodwill tour ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . For behind the issue of Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia should not control the Dardanelles and hence the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East . And beyond the issue of the Dardanelles loomed the biggest issue of all : the struggle between the U.S. and Russia for the control of Germany .
