txt Now is the time , the Painter visitor said , when many in of us are privileged to the House meet on terms of close and friendly intimacy fellow citizens of ours of whom , in the course of the revolving year , we see too little and too few . They are the people who paint  --  not the sort we encounter , . in studios and ateliers , and ( sometimes ) on the opening day of exhibitions of their work at art galleries to which we are lured with cocktails ? but the stout fellows who take over our apartments to do , in terms of applied color , what is called a redecorating job . - ? As we all know ? so Displaced the tale proceeded  --  the Person taking over is complete , at Home lock , stock and barrel . i The stout fellow appears out of the blue and moves in with an appalling assortment of impedimenta  --  buckets , cans , brushes , ladders , protective canvas and what not . And the place belongs to ? him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all over the lot and he makes himself unashamedly at home . But , if all the other painters are like ours , the displaced person who pays the rent is not treated like an intruder among his displaced possessions , reduced in the professional operation to a hopeless clutter of objects robbed of all sense of familiarity ? so that the man of the house feels like a stranger there , anyhow . On the contrary . Our What 's man ? he said his name in a was the same as that Name borne by a number of Kings of England , including the present reigning monarch ? treated us just like home folks , and turned out to be a most considerate housemate and a good companion . He promoted us to the rank of " Doctor " and made his dispositions with authority yet with more than decent regard for any timid suggestions of ours in the premises . When these dispositions had produced an effect of chaos thrice compounded , so that further proceedings in the line of duty seemed to us quite impossible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " manage . " And manage he did . While he slapped Nothing paint on the ceiling and to Do the wall and we linWith Art gered about , superfluous but fascinated , there was talk of many things  --  things that had nothing to do with paint . That is a happy state of affairs not too often arrived at with painters engaged in art for art 's sake . And we were grateful  --  because we know nothing about paint or art . One subject was horse Sporting racing . George ( you Days have guessed his name ) Reviewed had his favorites among those then running at Aqueduct . They were not always our favorites , but the discussion was devoid of rancor  --  and George showed considerable acquaintance with the past performances of our favorites . He admitted that he had once been .. a , pretty regular horse-player . But he had learned his lesson . It was a game at which nobody could win . And he had ceased to woo fortune at the tracks by putting his money on the ponies , either on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had not lost interest in the critters . That was all right with us , our visitor said , and explained that he had used the editorial we throughout his narration because ne was so modest , diffident and shy that a great big " I " stuck in his throat . He went on to say that Friend when the ladies of the in house came poking around Need to check up on what was doing that they did not like , George behaved to them in a fashion so indulgent that they did not hesitate to ask him to do odd jobs that were n't down in the contract . If it was at all within reason , George would do it . Altogether , though seeing the insides of your flat torn to pieces in order to have an over-all paint job done on it is one of the severest trials to which from time to time innocent hoUseholdeis are subjected  --  and this was a major operation  --  the whole family was so pleased with the way George did it that they hated ' .0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All that remained was the horrid task of putting the place together again without George 's help .
