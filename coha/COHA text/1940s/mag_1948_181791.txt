As a seedbed for little magazines , the American soil is fertile but thinly spread . Of the hundreds that have sprouted since 1912 , only a handful have put down roots . Some of the best ( Hound &; Horn , the Dial , etc. ) have withered and died . Last week a cluster of new ones bravely poked their heads above ground . <P> The most promising was Hudson Review , edited by three young Princeton alumni . It also promised the most , notably , never to fall into pedantry or opportunism , nor to " open its pages to those whose only merits lie in their anguish , their fervor , and their experimentation . " <P> Editors Frederick Morgan , 25 , an ex-G.I. , Joseph Bennett , 26 , a Navy veteran working as an investment analyst in Wall Street , and William Arrowsmith , 23 , a 1948 Rhodes scholar , have been two years launching Hudson Review . As a nonprofit literary venture , they got $6,600 in working capital from friends ( who hoped to deduct the contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Manhattan home of Morgan 's father , Sapolio Soapmaker John Williams Morgan . <P> Their first issue ( 4,500 copies ) , out this week , had poetry by E. E. Cummings , Wallace Stevens and Josephine Miles ; critical pieces by Mark Schorer , Herbert <P> Read and R. P.

Its first monthly issue ( 15,000 copies ) was adorned with a Picasso cover . <P> Instead , which looked like a folded-up air raid instruction poster , was an unhappy combination of surrealism and existentialism . Publisher John Myers wanted a monthly magazine which would be " hard , virile , masculine , and which would raise difficult questions that had never been asked before . " <P> Neurotica was a quarterly put out by nonneurotic St. Louis Antique Dealer Jay Irving Landesman , 29 . Said he : " Most of my friends are writers and artists and all of them are neurotic as hell . We decided there was a need for a magazine to explore the problems of the neurotic personality .
