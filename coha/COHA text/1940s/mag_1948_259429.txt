In its Mathies Mine , Pittsburgh Consolidation Coal Co. put to work last week a machine that set up the rumble of revolution in coal mining . In 60 seconds , the " Continuous Miner " of the Joy Manufacturing Co . ( TIME , April 5 ) ripped two tons of coal off the pitface and loaded it into a shuttle train . <P> Joy has already delivered 13 machines , expects to turn out 300 more for which it has orders by the end of 1949 . Joy 's president , J. D. A. Morrow , and many of his customers are confident that they will " create a new era in coal mining . " <P> Would the new era mean cheaper coal for consumers ? There was some doubt ; John L. Lewis ' miners would have to be taken into account . Due partly to the warm weather , 69 million tons of coal were above ground at last count ; in the piles was enough fuel for 45 days ' normal consumption . Lewis was reported to be thinking of ordering his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus Lewis would have an easier time next spring if , as expected , he demands a 30-hour week ( with 40 hours ' pay ) . The consumer , as usual , would be expected to foot the bill . <P> But it was no longer as simple as that . More mechanization would probably lower mining costs . Unless some of this saving was passed on to the consumer , coal consumption would fall still farther . With oil and coal both plentiful now , high-priced coal is barely able to compete with oil , and oil prices are falling . But there was no sign that Lewis was thinking of lower coal prices .
