Before the war , antiquated river steamers puffed through the heart of Paris along the silent river Seine . On a lovely spring morning those who sat on deck beheld history unfold before their eyes . Between floating laundry barges , tall poplars , lines of motionless fishermen , they passed within a stone 's throw of Daumier 's house on the Ile St. Louis . Gliding under the great city 's bridges , they threaded their way through the formal shadow of the Louvre , crept by the Tuileries Gardens , the Place de la Concorde , skirted the soft Bois de Boulogne , finally relinquished the monuments of men for those of nature as the steamer saluted the shores of La Grande Jatte , the island where bustled Parisian Mesdames once gathered for gaiety on sun-drenched meadows . <P> Such memories of the past were evoked last fortnight by a superb exhibition of 69 paintings at Manhattan 's Wildenstein gallery . There fortunate Francophiles could travel , in three rooms , all the way from Paris to the sea . People who had never been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who had . <P> The nostalgic journey started in the center of France 's capital with the most beautiful canvas in the show , Honore Daumier 's golden glimpse of a washerwoman ascending the steps from the river to the Quai d'Anjou , where the painter lived . A few hundred yards farther down the river , Paris ' crowded Pont Neuf , the city 's oldest bridge despite its name , was painted by Girtin , Renoir , Pissarro . A farewell was paid to Paris by several artists , among them the Dutchman Johann Barthold Jongkind , with a lovely view of Notre Dame towering over the river barges . <P> Outside the city , Painters Manet and Degas went horse racing at Longchamp , while Seurat settled himself down to immortalize La Grande Jatte with shimmering pictures of ladies taking the afternoon sun under the island 's trees . In the town of St. Cloud , whose park reveals the most magnificent panorama of Paris , Paris-born Alfred Sisley painted one of his best , The Bridge at St. Cloud . In the tranquil village of Giverny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter stream , and in summer the riot of purple irises and rare water lilies in his garden . <P> The peaceful Seine also drew foreigners . The self-mutilated genius Vincent Van Gogh , a Dutchman , painted the Seine 's golden Bridge at Asnires . From the U.S. came Painter Frank Boggs , from England ( in 1817 ) the short-lived Bonington , who painted the exhibition 's orange-tinted view of Mantes . <P> France 's renowned Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot showed his study of the ruins of the 900-year-old Abbey at Jumiges , a Seine village a few miles beyond Normandy 's ancient capital , Rouen . Celebrated for its churches , duck pt , sugar candy made of apples , and for the martyrdom of Joan of Arc , Rouen was the scene of paintings by Pissarro , Guillaumin , and Normandy 's almost unknown but excellent Albert Lebourg , who died , paralyzed , at Rouen only 15 years ago . Lebourg 's three paintings of the Seine near Rouen were infused with a diaphanous light suggesting England 's Turner , for whom he had great admiration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
