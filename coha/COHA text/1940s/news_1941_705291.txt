The British people can recall some of their ' own apprehensions over , and the active opposition to , the British Government 's emergency powers bill which , though rushed into law on the eve of war , was subsequently held by members of all parties to be too great an infringement upon democratic liberties . Subsequently , through parliamentary pressure , some of the sweeping powers of the act were modified . The British Method The manner in which the British Government bowed in this matter to the will of the nation as expressed by its elected representatives was welcomed as an even more reassuring sign than the actual modifications in the Act itself .
