New Mexico 's able Senator Carl A. Hatch withdrew this week as a candidate for reelection . Stated reason : he wants a federal judgeship . Another reason : there is some doubt that he could defeat Republican Patrick J. Hurley . Most New Mexico Democrats thought that the man who could beat Hurley was Agriculture Secretary Clinton Anderson ; they hoped he would quit the Cabinet soon and take up Hatch 's lance .
