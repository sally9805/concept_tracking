txt Secretary Stimson has raised the crucial question on which the American people can no longer delay a decision . That question is whether or not the American Navy should now be used " to make secure the seas for the delivery of our munitions to Great Britain . " A crisis in this struggle between two irreconcilable ways of life has posed the choice for us : " After the carefully determined course which we have pursued until this moment ; after the clear statements and appeals which have been made by our President in respect to the danger which confronts us ; after the overwhelming response to his appeals which has been made by the Congress ; after we have taken our place definitely behind the warring democracies and against the aggressor nations in the defense of our freedom ; after providing for billions ' worth of munitions to carry on that defense , and while we hold in our hands the instrument ready and able to make all these steps effective , shall we now flinch and permit these munitions to be sunk in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our whole history as a nation to make such a supposition credible . " Neither the Government nor the people of the United States have ever given occasion to make any one believe that such an act of irresponsibility and indecision would be possible . " On the contrary , the American Government and the American people have shown in every crisis of our history a firmness of will ' and an ability to make decisions , once the facts of a given situation were clearly visible . In the present case there is good reason to believe that an overwhelming majority of our people favor use of the American Navy to protect supplies for Britain " if it appears certain that Britain will be defeated unless we use it . " The responsibility of leadership is now to demonstrate that this situation , which many of our people still believe to be hypothetical , has already become actual : that Britain can not survive without the steady reinforcement of our supplies and that the British Navy is now spread so thin that the support of our own Navy is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted . In this respect one thing can be said with certainty . If we are content merely to drift along , if we wait until " it appears certain " ? to the last skeptic ? " that Britain will be defeated unless " ? then it will already be too late to use our Navy . For the history of this war shows that without courageous leadership people wait for a disaster actually to occur before they are willing to believe that it is " certain . " We can not afford to make the same mistake that the other democracies have made over and over again  --  the mistake of " too little and too late . " The decision we are called upon to make is one of the , gravest in our history . It is a decision which we must make with our eyes open , fully aware of all the risks involved and with no attempt to minimize them . In all candor we are forced to recognize that if we use the American Navy to convoy merchant ships to Britain , Germany will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks an American warship would probably have sunk a German submarine or been sunk by one . This would be " war , " if either side chose to regard it as war . So , for that matter , could our aid to Britain under the lease-lend bill have been regarded by Germany as an act of war , if Hitler chose to place that interpretation on it . But convoys would have this great difference compared with the steps we have taken thus far under the lease-lend bill . They would almost inevitably mean the loss of some American lives . This could be justified on one ground only  --  that in the end it would save many more American lives , as well as American liberties and all the values of civilization that we hold most precious . This is the ground on which our decision must now be taken . Mr. Stimson states the choice exactly when he says that it lies between using the American Navy now for the purpose for which we have built it and maintained it  --  the protection of the vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Navy until , with the power of the British fleet and nation broken , our own Navy 's power of execution " would at once shrink to but an impotent fraction of what it could do at the present moment . " The question we confront today is not whether or not Americans " want war . " If Britain is defeated , we are going to get war , whether or not we want it . The only real question is whether we shall choose to fight it under our own terms and conditions , or under the terms and conditions set by Hitler . Let us not wait , with false confidence , until our one possible remaining great ally is beaten , when its resources would be turned against us as surely as Polish , Dutch , Belgian and French resources are being turned against the British . Let us , while there is still time , keep Britain in the war . Let us have our showdown with Hitler while it is still possible for us to have it at our own tremendous advantage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
