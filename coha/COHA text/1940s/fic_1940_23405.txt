AFTER MANY A SUMMER A NOVEL IN FIVE PARTS-PART FOUR BY ALDOLTS HUXLEY V IRGIN/A did not wake up that morn- ing till nearly ten ; and even after having had her bath and eaten her breakfast she remained in bed for another hour or more , her eyes closed , leaning back motionless against the heaped-up pillows , like a beautiful young convalescent newly emerged from the valley of the shadow . The valley of the shadow of death ; of the greater deaths and all the little deaths . Through deaths come transfigurations . He who would save his life must lose it . Men and women are continually trying to lose their lives , the stale , unprofitable , senseless lives of their ordinary personalities . Forever trying to get rid of them , and in a thousand different ways . In the frenzies of gambling and revivalism ; in the monomanias of avarice and perversion , of research and sectarianism and ambition ; in the compensatory lunacies of alcohol , of reading , of day-dreaming , of morphia ; in the hallucinations of opium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political enthusiasm and erotic pleasure ; in the stupors of veronal and exhaustion . To escape ; to forget one 's own , old , wearisome identity ; to become someone else or , better , some other thing a mere body , strangely numbed or more than ordinarily sentient ; or else just a state of impersonal mind , a mode of unindividualized consciousness . What happiness , what a blissful alleviation even for such as were not previouslyaware that there was anything in their condition that needed to be alleviated ! Virginia had been one of those , happy in limitation , not sufficiently conscious of her personal self to realize its ugliness and inadequacy , or the fundamental wretchedness of the human state . And yet , when Dr. Obispo had scientifically engineered her escape into an erotic epilepsy more excruciatingly intense than anything she had known before or even imagined possible , Virginia had realized that after all there was something in her existence that required alleviating and that this headlong plunge through an intenser , utterly alien consciousness into the darkness of a total oblivion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propped up against her pillows , Virginia was suffering her daily resurrection from the valley of the shadow of her nocturnal deaths . From having been epileptically something else , she was becoming her own self again  --  a self , it was true , still somewhat numbed and bewildered by fatigue , still haunted by the memory of strange scenes and overpowering sensations , but none the less recognizably the old Virginia ; the Virginia who admired Uncle Jo for his success and was grateful to him for having given her such a wonderful time , the Virginia who had always laughed and thought life grand and never bothered about things . And now this Virginia was doublecrossing her poor , old admired Uncle Jo  --  not just telling a few little fibs , which might happen to anyone , but deliberately and systematically doublecrossing him . And not only him ; she was also doublecrossing poor Pete . Talking to him all the time ; giving him the glad eye ( as glad an eye , at any rate , as she was capable of giving in the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that Uncle Jo would n't suspect Sig . Not that she would n't be glad in some ways if Uncle Jo did suspect him . She 'd love to see him getting a punch on the jaw and being thrown out . Just love it ! But meanwhile she was doing everything she could to cover him up , and in the process making that poor , idiot boy imagine she was stuck on him . A doublecrosser  --  that was all she was . A doublecrosser . The knowledge of this worried her , it made her feel unhappy and ashamed ; it prevented her laughing at things the way she used to ; it kept her thinking , and feeling bad about what she was doing , and resolving not to do it again ; resolving , but not being able to prevent herself doing it again , even though she really hated herself for doing it and hated Sig for making her and , above all , for telling her , in that horrible , hard-boiled , cynical way , just how he made her and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons why she had to do it again was that it stopped her feeling bad about having done it before . But then , afterward , she felt bad again . But it just could n't last this way forever ; she simply refused to believe she 'd always have that awful rubber feeling in her bones . Some day she 'd feel strong enough to tell Sig to go to hell . Virginia sighed profoundly and , closing her eyes again , tried , by a simulation of sleep , to recapture the happy oblivion from which the light of morning had forced her unwillingly to emerge . XV Mr. Stoyte had spent his morning at the Beverly Pantheon . Very reluctantly ; for he had a horror of cemeteries , even his own . But the claims of moneymaking were sacred ; business was a duty to which all merely personal considerations had to be sacrificed . And talk of business the Beverly Pantheon was the finest real estate proposition in the country . The land had been bought during the War at five hundred dollars an acre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and statuary ) to the tune of about ten thousand an acre , and was now selling , in grave sites , at the rate of a hundred and sixty thousand an acre  --  selling so fast that the entire capital outlay had already been amortized , so that everything from now on would be pure jam . And of course as the population of Los Angeles increased , the jam would become correspondingly more copious . And the population was increasing , at the rate of nearly ten per cent per annum  --  and , what was more , the main accessions consisted of elderly retired people from other States of the Union , the very people who would bring the greatest immediate profit to the Pantheon . And so when Charlie Habakkuk sent that urgent call for him to come over and discuss the latest plans of improvements and extensions Mr. Stoyte had found it morally impossible to refuse . Repressing his antipathies , he had done his duty . All that morning the two men had sat with their cigars in Charlie 's office at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of his , and spouted cigar smoke from his nostrils , and talked  --  God , how he had talked ! As though he were one of those men in a red fez trying to make you buy an Oriental carpet  --  and incidentally , Mr. Stoyte reflected morosely , that was what Charlie looked like ; only he was better fed than most of those carpet boys , and therefore greasier . " Cut the sales talk , " he growled out loud . " You seem to forget I own the place . " Charlie looked at him with an expression of pained surprise . Sales talk ? But this was n't sales talk . This was real , this was earnest . The Pantheon was AFTER MANY his baby ; for all practical purposes , he had invented the place . It was he who had thought up the Tiny Taj and the Church of the Bard ; he who , on his own initiative , had bought that bargain lot of statues at Genoa ; he who had first clearly formulated the policy of injecting sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to introduce into the cemetery any representation of grief or age , any symbol of mortality , any image of the sufferings of Jesus . He had had to fight for his ideas , he had had to listen to a lot of criticism ; but the results had proved him right . Anyone who complained that there was no Crucifixion in the place could be referred to the published accounts . And here was Mr. Stoyte talking sarcastically about sales talk . Sales talk , indeed , when the demand for space in the Pantheon was so great that existing accommodations would soon be inadequate . There would have to be enlargements . More space , more buildings , more amenities . Bigger and better , progress , service . At the top of the Tower of Resurrection Charlie Habakkuk unfolded his plans . The new extension was to have a Poet 's Corner , open to any bona fide writer  --  though he was afraid they 'd have to draw the line at the authors of advertising copy , which was a pity , because a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra for the prestige of being buried with the moving picture people . But that cut both ways because the scenario writers would n't feel that the Poet 's Corner was exclusive enough if you let in the advertising boys . And seeing that the moving picture fellows made so much more than the others . . . well , it stood to reason , Charlie had concluded , it stood to reason . And of course they 'd have to have a replica of Westminster Abbey in the Poet 's Corner . Wee Westminster  --  it would sound kind of cute . And as they needed a couple of extra mortuary furnaces anyhow , they 'd have them installed there in the Dean 's Yard . And they 'd put a new automatic record player in the crypt , so that there 'd be more variety in the music . Not that people did n't appreciate the Perpetual Wurlitzer ; they did . But all the same it got a bit monotonous . So he 'd thought they might have some recordings of a choir singing hymns , and things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a change , some preacher giving an inspirational message , so that you 'd be able to sit in the Garden of Contemplation , for example , and listen to the Wurlitzer for a few minutes and then the choir singing " Abide with Me " and then a nice sort of Barrymore voice saying some piece like the " Gettysburg Address " or " Laugh and the World Laughs with You , " or maybe some nice juicy bit by Mrs. Eddy or Ralph Waldo Trine  --  anything would do so long as it was inspirational enough . And then there was his idea of the Catacombs . And , boy , it was the best idea he 'd ever had . Leading Mr. Stoyte to the southeastern window , he had pointed across an intervening valley of tombs and cypresses and the miniature monuments of bogus antiquity , to where the land sloped up again to a serrated ridge on the farther side . There , he had shouted excitedly , there , in that hump in the middle ; they 'd tunnel down into that . Hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them earthquake proof . The only class-A Catacombs in the world . And little chapels , like the ones in Rome . And a lot of phony-looking murals , looking like they were real old . You could get them done cheap by one of those W.P.A. art projects . Not that those guys knew how to paint of course ; but that was quite O.K. , seeing that the murals had to look phony anyhow . And they would n't have anything but candles and little lamps for people to carry around  --  no electric light at all , except right at the very end of all those winding passages and stairs , where there 'd be a great big sort of underground church , with one of those big nude statues that were going up at the San Francisco Fair and that they 'd be glad to sell for a thousand bucks or even less when the show was over  --  one of those modernistic broads with muscles on them  --  and they 'd have her standing right in the middle there , with maybe some fountains spouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she 'd look kind of real . Why , the tourists would come a thousand miles to see it . Because there was nothing people liked so much as caves . Look at those Carlsbad Caverns , for example ; and all those caves in Virginia . And those were just common or garden natural caves , without murals or anything . Whereas these would be Catacombs . Yes , sir ; real Catacombs , like the things the Christian Martyrs lived in ? and , by gum , that was another idea ! Martyrs ! Why could n't they have a Chapel of the Martyrs with a nice plaster group of some girls with no clothes on , just going to be eaten by a lion ? People would get a real thrill out of that . Mr. Stoyte had listened wearily and with repugnance . He loathed his Pantheon and everything to do with it . Loathed it because , in spite of statues and Wurlitzer , it spoke to him of nothing but disease and death and corruption and final judgment ; because it was here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the foot of the pedestal of Rodin 's Baiser . Charlie 's enthusiasm for Catacombs and Wee Westminsters elicited no answering warmth ; only occasional grunts and a final sullen O.K. for everything except the Chapel of the Martyrs . Not that the Chapel of the Martyrs seemed to Mr. Stoyte a bad idea ; on the contrary , he was convinced that the public would go crazy over it . If he rejected it , it was merely on principle  --  because it would never do to allow Charlie Habakkuk to think he was always right . " Get plans and estimates for everything else , " he ordered in a tone so gruff that he might have been delivering a reprimand . " But no martyrs . I wo n't have any martyrs . " Almost in tears , Charlie pleaded for just one lion , just one early Christian Virgin with her hands tied behind her back  --  because people got such a kick out of anything to do with ropes or handcuffs . Two or three Virgins would have been much better of course ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Stoyte , " he implored , clasping his eloquent hands . " Only one . " Obstinately deaf to all his entreaties , Mr. Stoyte shook his head . " No martyrs here , " he said . " That 's final . " And to show that it was final he threw away the butt of his cigar and got up to go . Five minutes later Charlie Habakkuk was letting off steam to his secretary . The ingratitude of people ! The stupidity . He 'd a good mind to resign , just to show the old buzzard that they could n't get on without him . Not for five minutes . Who was it that had made the place what it was : the uniquest cemetery in the world ? Absolutely the uniquest . Who ? ( Charlie slapped himself on the chest . ) And who made all the money ? Jo Stoyte . And what had he done to make the place a success ? Absolutely nothing at all . It was enough to make you want to be a Communist . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pushing you around as though you were a bum off the streets ! Well , there was one comfort : Old Jo had n't been looking any too good this morning . One of these days maybe they 'd have the pleasure of burying him . Down there in the vestibule of the Columbarium , eight feet underground . And serve him right ! It was not only that he did n't look too good ; leaning back in the car which was taking him down to Beverly Hills on his way to see Clancy , Mr. Stoyte was thinking , as he had thought so often during these past two or three weeks , that he did n't feel too good . He 'd wake up in the morning feeling kind of sluggish and heavy , and his mind did n't seem to be as clear as it was . Obispo called it suppressed influenza and made him take those pills every night ; but they did n't seem to do him any good . He went on feeling that way just the same . And on top of everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Baby was acting strange , like someone that was n't really there ; so quiet and not noticing anything and starting when you spoke to her and asking what you said . Acting for all the world like one of those advertisements for Sal Hepatica or California Syrup of Figs ; and that was what he 'd have thought it was if it had n't been for the way she went on with that Peter Boone fellow . Always talking to him at meals  --  and asking him to come and have a swim ; and wanting to take a squint down his microscope  --  and what sort of a damn did she give for microscopes , he 'd like to know ? Throwing herself at him  --  that was what it had looked like on the surface . You 'd say she was kind of stuck on the fellow . But then why should it have happened so suddenly ? Because she 'd never shown any signs of being stuck on him before . Always treated him like you 'd treat a great big dog  --  friendly and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pat on the head and then , when he 'd wagged his tail , thinking of something else . No , he could n't understand it ; he just could n't figure it out . It looked like she was stuck on him ; but then , at the same time , it looked like she just did n't notice if he was a boy or a dog . Because that was how she was acting even now . She paid a lot of attention to him  --  only the way you 'd pay attention to a nice big retriever . And that was what had thrown him out . If she 'd been stuck on Pete in the ordinary way then he 'd have got mad , and raised hell , and thrown the boy out of the house . But how could you raise hell over a dog ? How could you get mad with a girl for telling a retriever she 'd like to have a squint down his microscope ? You could n't even if you tried ; because getting mad did n't make any sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry , trying to figure things out and not being able to . There was only one thing that was clear , and that was that the Baby meant more to him than he had thought , more than he had ever believed it possible that anyone should mean to him . It had begun by his just wanting her  --  wanting her to touch , to hold , to handle , to eat ; wanting her because she was warm and smelt good ; wanting her because she was young and he was old , because she was so innocent and he too tired for anything not innocence to excite . That was how it had begun ; but almost immediately something else had happened . That youth of hers , that innocence and sweetness  --  they were more than just exciting . She was so cute and lovely and childish , he almost felt like crying over her , even while he wanted to hold and handle and devour . She did the strangest things to him  --  made him feel good , like you felt when you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time made him feel good , like you felt when you were at church , or listening to William Jennings Bryan , or making some poor kid happy by giving him a doll or something . And Virginia was n't just anybody 's kid , like the ones at the hospital ; she was his kid , his very own . He had been happier since he 'd known her than he 'd ever been in years . With her around , things had seemed worth doing again . You did n't have to go through life asking " why ? " The reason for everything was there in front of you , wearing that cunning little yachting cap maybe , ' or all dressed up with her emeralds and everything for some party with the moving picture crowd . And now something had happened . The reason for carrying on was being taken away from him . The Baby had changed ; she was fading away from him ; she had gone somewhere else . Where had she gone ? And why ? Why did she want to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was an old man , and the white slab was there in the vestibule of the Columbarium , waiting for him . " What 's the matter , Baby ? " he had asked . Time and again he had asked with anguish in his heart , too miserable to be angry , too much afraid of being left alone to care about his dignity or his rights , about anything except keeping her , at whatever cost . " What 's the matter , Baby ? " And all she ever did was to look at him as though she were looking at him from some place a million miles away  --  to look at him like that and say : Nothing ; she was feeling fine ; she had n't got anything on her mind ; and , no , there was n't anything he could do for her , because he 'd given her everything already , and she was perfectly happy . And if he mentioned Pete ( kind of casually , so she should n't think he suspected anything ) she would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she liked Pete ; he was a nice boy , but unsophisticated  --  and that made her laugh ; and she liked laughing . " But , Baby , you 're different , " he would say ; and it was difficult for him to keep his voice from breaking , he was so unhappy . " You do n't act like you used to , Baby . " And all she 'd answer was that that was funny because she felt just the same . " You do n't feel the same about me , " he would say . And she 'd say she did . And he 'd say no . And she 'd say it was n't true . Because what reasons did he have for saying she felt different about him ? And of course she was quite right ; there were n't any reasons you could lay your finger on . He could n't honestly say she acted less affectionate , or did n't want to let him kiss her , or anything like that . She was different because of something you could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked and moved and sat around . He could n't describe it except by saying it was like she was n't really there where you thought you were looking at her , but some place else ; some place where you could n't touch her or talk to her or even really sec her . That was how it was . But whenever he had tried to explain itto her she had just laughed at him and said he must be having some of those feminine intuitions you read about in stories  --  only his feminine intuitions were all wrong . And so there he 'd be , back where he started from , trying to figure it out and not being able to , and worrying himself sick . Yes , worrying himself sick . Because when he 'd got over feeling sluggish and heavy , like he always did in the mornings now , he felt so worried about the Baby that he 'd start bawling out the servants and being rude to that goddamned Englishman and getting mad with Obispo . And the next thing that happened was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting heartburn and sour stomach ; and one day he had such a pain that he 'd thought it was appendicitis . But Obispo had said it was just gas because of his suppressed influenza . And then he 'd got mad and told the fellow he must be a lousy doctor if he could n't cure a little thing like that . Which must have put the fear of God into Obispo because he 'd said , " Just give me two or three days more . That 's all I need to complete the treatment . " And he 'd said that suppressed influenza was a funny thing ; did n't seem to be anything , but poisoned the whole system , so you could n't think straight any more ; and you 'd get to imagining things that were n't really there , and worrying about them . Which might be true in a general way ; but in this case he just knew it was n't all imagination . The Baby was different ; he had a reason for being worried . Sunk in his mood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windings of the mountain road , through the bowery oasis of Beverly Hills and eastward ( fur Glancy lived in Hollywood ) along Santa Monica Boulevard . Over the telephone that morning Clancy had put on one of his melodramatic conspirator acts . From the rigmarole of hints and dark allusions and altered names , Mr. Stoyte had gathered that the news was good . Clancy and his boys had evidently succeeded in buying up most of the best land in the San Felipe Valley . At another time Mr. Stoyte would have exulted in his triumph ; to-day , even the prospect of making a million or two of easy money gave him no sort of pleasure . In the world he had been reduced to inhabiting millions were irrelevant . For what could millions do to allay his miseries ? The miseries of an old , tired , empty man ; of a man who had no end in life but himself , no philosophy , no knowledge but of his own interests , no appreciations , not even any friends  --  only a daughter-mistress , a concubine-child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now this being , on whom he had relied to give significance to his life , had begun to fail him . He had come to doubt her fidelity  --  but to doubt without tangible reasons , to doubt in such a way that none of the ordinary satisfying reactions , of rage , of violence , of recrimination was appropriate . The sense was going out of his life and he could do nothing ; for lie was in a situation with which he did not know how to deal , hopelessly bewildered . And always , in the la , ekground of his mind there floated an image of that circular marble room , with Rodin 's image of desire at the center , and that white slab in the pavement at its base  --  the slab that would some day have his name engraved upon it : Joseph Panton Stoytc , and the dates of his birth and death . And along with that inscription went another , in orange letters on a coal-black ground : It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conspiratorially announcing victory . Good news , good news ! A year or two from now he would be richer by another million . But the millions were in one world and the old , unhappy , frightened man was in another , and there was no communication between the two . XVI Luncheon , in the absence of Mr. Stoyte , was a very cheerful meal . The servants went about their business unreprimanded . Jeremy could talk without the risk of being snubbed or insulted . Dr. Obispo was able to tell the story about the chimney sweep who applied for life insurance after going on his honeymoon , and , from the faraway depths of that almost trancelike state of fatigue  --  that state which she deliberately fostered , so as not to have to think too much and feel too badly about what was happening  --  Virginia was at liberty to laugh at it as loudly as she liked . And though with one part of herself she would have liked not to laugh at all , because she did n't want to make Sig think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part she wanted to laugh , indeed could n't help laughing , because , after all , the story was really very funny . Besides , it was such a relief not to have to put on that act with Pete for the benefit of Uncle Jo . No double-crossing . For once she could be herself . The only fly in the ointment was that this self she was being was such a miserable specimen ; a self with bones that would go like rubber whenever that horrible Sig chose to come along . IIer laughter abruptly ceased . Only Pete was consistently unhappy  --  about the chimney sweep of course , and Virginia 's burst of merriment ; but also because Barcelona had fallen and , with it , all his hopes of a speedy victory over Fascism , all prospect of ever seeing any of his old comrades again . And that was n't all . Laughing at the story of the chimney sweep was only a single painful incident among many . Virginia had allowed the first two courses of the meal to come and go without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? His distress was aggravated by bitter bewilderment . Why ? In the light of what had been happening during the past three weeks it was inexplicable . Ever since the evening of the day she had turned back at the Grotto , Virginia had been simply wonderful to him  --  going out of her way to talk to him , inviting him to tell her things about Spain and even about biology . Why , she had actually asked to look at something under the miscroscope . Trembling with happiness , so that he could hardly adjust the slide , he had focussed the instrument on a preparation of the carp 's intestinal flora . Then she had sat down in his place and as she bent over the eyepiece her auburn curls had swung down on either side of the microscope and , above the edge of her pink sweater , the nape of her neck had been uncovered , so white , so tangibly inviting that the enormous effort he had had to make to prevent himself from kissing it had left him feeling almost faint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished that he had n't made that effort . But then his better self would reassert its rule and he was glad again that he had . Because of course it would n't have been right . He still remembered what his pious and conventional mother had said about kissing anyone you were n't engaged to ; he was still at heart the earnest adolescent whom Reverend Schlitz 's eloquence had fired during the perplexities of puberty , with a passionate determination to be continent , a conviction of the Sacredness of Love , an enthusiasm for something wonderful called Christian marriage . But at the moment , unfortunately , he was n't earning enough to feel justified in asking Virginia to accept his sacred love and enter into Christian marriage with him . And there was the added complication that on his side the Christian marriage would n't be Christian except in substance . And even if those difficulties could somehow be miraculously smoothed away , there remained the dreadful fact of Mr. Stoyte . He knew of course that Mr. Stoyte was nothing more than a father to Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that excessive certainty that is born of desire ; knew it in the same way as Don Quixote knewthat the pasteboard vizor of his helmet was as strong as steel . It was the kind of knowledge about which it is prudent to make no inquiries ; and of course if he asked Virginia to marry him such inquiries , or the information such inquiries might be expected to elicit , would almost inevitably be forced upon him . Yet another complicating factor in the situation was Mr. Propter . For if Mr. Propter was right , as Pete was coming to feel more and more certain that he was , then it was obviously unwise to do something that would make more difficult the passage from the human level to the level of eternity . And though he loved Virginia he found it difficult to believe that marriage to her would be anything but an obstacle to the enlightenment of everybody concerned . Or rather , he had thought this ; but in the course of the last week or two his opinion had changed . Or to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was just uncertain and bewildered . For Virginia 's character seemed almost suddenly to have changed . From being childlike , loud and extraverted , her innocence had become quiet and inscrutable . In the past she had treated him with the jocular and casual friendliness of mere good fellowship ; but recently there had been a strange alteration . The jokes had stopped and a kind of earnest solicitude had taken their place . She had been simply wonderful to him  --  but not in the way a girl is wonderful to a man she wants to fall in love with her . No , Virginia had been wonderful like a sister ? and not an ordinary sister , either : almost a Sister of Mercy . Not just any Sister of Mercy ; that particular Sister who had nursed him when he was in hospital at Gerona ; the young Sister with the big eyes and the pale oval face , like the face of the Virgin Mary in a picture . There had been a kind of sudden conversion from the outward-looking life to the inward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of this conversion was beyond his comprehension ; but the fact was mani-AFTER MANY fest , and he had respected it . Respected it by not kissing her neck as she bent over the microscope ; by never even touching her arm or taking her hand ; by not saying to her one word of all he felt about her . In the strange inexplicable circumstances of her transformation such ac-dons , he had felt , would have been inappropriate to the point positively of sacrilege . It was as a sister that she had chosen to be wonderful to him ; it was therefore as a brother that he had responded . And now , for no known reason , she seemed suddenly to have become unaware of his existence . It was beyond him ; he simply could n't figure it out . With the arrival of the coffee Dr. Obispo announced that he proposed to take the afternoon off and , as there was nothing that urgently needed doing in the laboratory , he advised Pete to do the same . Pete thanked him and , pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go through the humiliation of being ignored when Virginia discussed her plans for the afternoon ) , swallowed his coffee and , mumbling excuses , left the room . A little later he was out in the sunshine , walking down toward the plain . As he went he thought of some of the things Mr. Propter had said to him in the course of his recent visits . Of what he had said about nobody ever getting something for nothing  --  so that a man would pay for too much money , for example , or too much power or too much sex , by being shut up more tightly inside his own ego . Misplaced seriou-mess  --  the source of some of our most fatal errors . One should be serious , Mr. Propter had said , only about what deserves to be taken seriously . And , on the strictly human level , there was nothing that deserved to be taken seriously except the suffering men inflicted upon themselves by their crimes and follies . But , in the last analysis , most of these crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not deserve it . And that , Mr. Propter had continued , was another of the enormous defects of so-called goodliterature ; it accepted the conventional scale of values ; it respected power and position ; it admired success ; it treated as though they were reasonable the mainly lunatic preoccupations of statesmen , lovers , business men , social climbers , parents . In a word , it took seriously the causes of suffering as well as the suffering . It helped to perpetuate misery by explicitly or implicitly approving the thoughts and feelings and practices which could not fail to result in misery . And this approval was bestowed in the most magnificent and persuasive language . So that even when a tragedy ended badly the reader was hypnotized by the eloquence of the piece into imagining that it was all somehow noble and worth while . Which of course it was n't . Because if you considered them dispassionately nothing could be more silly and squalid than the themes of Phedre , or Othello , or Wuthering Heights , or the Agamemnon . But the treatment of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that the reader or the spectator was left with the conviction that , in spite of the catastrophe , all was really well with the world , the all too human world , which had produced it . No , a good satire was much more deeply truthful and of course much more profitable than a good tragedy . The trouble was that so few good satires existed , because so few satirists were prepared to carry their criticism of human values far enough . Candide , for example , was admirable as far as it went ; but it went no farther than debunking the principal human activities in the name of the ideal of harmlessness . Now it was perfectly true that harmlessness was the highest ideal most people could aspire to ; for , though few had the power to do much positive good , there was nobody who could not refrain , if he so desired , from evil . Nevertheless , mere harmlessness , however excellent , most certainly did n't represent the highest possible ideal . Il faut cultiver nOtre jardin was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only the last but one . The sun was in such a position that as he walked down the hill Pete saw two little rainbows spouting from the nipples of Giambologna 's nymph . Thoughts of Noah immediately arose in conjunction with thoughts of Virginia in her white satin bathing costume . He tried to repress the latter as incompatible with the new thoughts he was trying to cultivate about the Sister of Mercy ; and since Noah was not a subject that would bear much thinking about , he proceeded instead to concentrate on that talk he had had with Mr. Propter about sex . It had begun with his own puzzled questionings as to what sort of sexual behavior was normal  --  not statistically normal of course , but normal in that absolute sense in which perfect vision or unimpaired digestion may be called normal . What sort of sexual behavior was normal in that sense of the word ? And Mr. Prop-ter had answered : None . But there must be , he had protested . If good could be manifested on the animal level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was absolutely normal and natural , just as there was an absolutely normal and natural sort of digestive activity . But man 's sexual behavior , Mr. Propter had answered , was n't on the same level as digestion . A rat 's love making  --  yes , that was on the same level as digestion ; for the entire process was instinctive ; in other words , was controlled by the physiological intelligence of the body  --  the same physiological intelligence as correlated the actions of heart and lungs and kidneys , as regulated temperature , as nourished the muscles and made them do the work demanded of them by the central nervous system . Men 's bodily activities were controlled by the same physiological intelligence ; and it was that intelligence which , on the animal level , manifested good . In human beings sexual behavior was almost completely outside the jurisdiction of this physiological intelligence . It controlled only the cellular activities which made sexual behavior possible . All the rest was non-instinctive and took MAGAZINE place on the strictly human level of self-consciousness . Even when men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexuality they were still on the human level . Which meant that they were still self-conscious , still dominated by words  --  and where there were words there , of necessity , were memories and wishes , judgment and imagination . There , inevitably , were the past and the future , the actual and the fantastic , regret and anticipation , good and evil , the creditable and the discreditable , the beautiful and the ugly . Among men and women even the most apparently bestial acts of eroticism were associated with some or all of these non-animal factors  --  factors which were injected into every human situation by the existence of language . This meant that there was no one type of human sexuality that could be called " normal " in the sense in which one could say that there was a normality of vision or digestion . In that sense , all kinds of human sexuality were strictly abnormal . The different kinds of sexual behavior could not be judged by referring them to an absolute , natural norm . They could be judged only in reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each case . Thus if an individual wanted to be well thought of in any given society he or she could safely regard as " normal " the type of sexual behavior currently tolerated by that local religion and approved by the " best people . " But there were some individuals who cared little for the judgment of angry God or even of the best people . Their principal desire was for intense and reiterated stimulation of their senses and feelings . For these it was obvious " normality " in sexual behavior would be quite different from what it was for the more social-minded . Then there would be all the kinds of sexuality " normal " to those desirous of making the best of both worlds  --  the personal world of sensations and emotions , and the social world of moral and religious conventions . The " normalities " of Tartufe and Pecksniff ; of the clergy-men who ca n't keep away from schoolgirls ; the cabinet ministers with a secret mania for handsome youths . And finally there were those who were concerned neither to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor to enjoy repeated emotional and sensuous stimulations , but whose chief preoccupation was with enlightenment and liberation , with the problem of transcending personality , of passing from the human level to the level of eternity . Their conceptions of " normality " in sexual behavior would not resemble those of the men and women in any of the other categories . From the concrete tennis court the children of the Chinese cook were flying kites in the shape of birds and equipped with little whistles , so that they warbled plaintively in the wind . The cheerful quacking sound of Cantonese drifted down to Pete 's ears . Across the Pacific , he reflected , millions upon millions of such children had died already or were dying . Below them , in the Sacred Grotto , stood the plaster figure of Our Lady . Pete thought of Virginia kneeling in white shorts and a yachting cap , of the abusive eloquence of Reverend Schlitz , of Dr. Obispo 's jokes , of Alexis Carrel on the subject of Lourdes , of Lee 's History of the Inquisition , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niemoller and John Knox and Torquemada and that Sister of Mercy and again of Virginia and finally of Mr. Propter as the only person he knew who could make some sense out of the absurd , insane , diabolical confusion of it all . XVII Somewhat to Jeremy 's disappointment , Dr. Obispo was not at all mortified by the information that his ideas had been anticipated in the eighteenth century . " I 'd like to hear some more about your Fifth Earl , " he had said , as they glided down into the cellars with the Vermeer . " You say he lived to ninety ? " " More than ninety , " Jeremy answered . " Ninety-six or seven , I forget which . And died in the middle of a scandal , what 's more . " " What sort of a scandal ? " Jeremy coughed and patted the top of his head . " The usual sort , " he fluted . " You mean , the old bozo was still at it ? " Dr. Obispo asked incredulously . " Still at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the affair in the unpublished papers of Greville . He died just in time . They were actually on the point of arresting him . " " What for ? " Jeremy twinkled again and coughed . " Well , " he said slowly and in his most Cranfordlike manner , " it seems that he had a tendency to take his pleasures rather homicidally . " " You mean , he 'd killed someone . " " Not actually killed , " Jeremy answered ; " just damaged . " Dr. Obispo was rather disappointed , but consoled himself almost immediately by the reflection that at ninety-six even damage was pretty creditable . " I 'd like to look into this a little further , " he added . " Well , the note-book 's at your disposal , " said Jeremy politely . Dr. Obispo thanked him . Together they walked toward Jeremy 's work room . " The handwriting 's rather difficult , " said Jeremy as they entered . " I think it might be easier if I read it aloud to you . " Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time ; but as the other was anxious to find an excuse for putting off to another occasion the wearisome task of sorting papers that did n't interest him , the protest was out-protested . Jeremy insisted on being altruistic . Dr. Obispo thanked him and settled down to listen . Jeremy took his eyes out of their native element for long enough to polish his spectacles , then began to re-read aloud the passage he had been reading that morning , when the bell rang for lunch . " ' It is to be found in the Mud , ' " he concluded , " ' and only awaits a skilful Angler . ' " Dr. Obispo chuckled . " You might almost use it as a definition of science , " he said . " What is science ? Science is angling in the mud angling for immor-tality and for anything else that may happen to turn up . " He laughed again and added that he liked the old bastard . Jeremy read out the next entry . " ' December , 1796 . After this second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than before and advanced less far . I hang here suspended above the pit as though by a single thread , and the substance of that thread is Misery . ' " With an elegantly bent little finger Dr. Obispo flicked the ash of his cigarette on to the floor . " One of those pharmaceutical tragedies , " he commented . " With a course of thiamin chloride and some testosterone , I could have made him as happy as a sandboy . Has it ever struck you , " he added , " what a lot of the finest romantic literature is the result of bad doctoring ? " I could lie down like a tired child And weep away this life of care . " Lovely ! But if they 'd known how to clear up poor Shelley 's chronic tuberculous pleurisy it would never have been written . Lying down like a tired child and weeping life away happens to be one of the most characteristic symptoms of chronic tuberculous pleurisy . And most of the other Weltschmerz boys were either sick men or alcoholics or dope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from writing as he did . " Dr. Obispo looked at Jeremy with a wolfish smile that was almost childlike in the candor of its triumphant cynicism . " Well , let 's hear how the Old Boy gets over his troubles . " The next note was dated January 11 , 1797 : " This year the anniversary of my birth calls up Thoughts more gloomy than ever before . I am too weary to record them . The day being fine and remarkably warm for the Season , I had myself carried in my chair to the fishponds . The bell was rung and the Carp at once came hurrying to be fed . As Iwatched the fishes pushing and jostling for their dinner , like a crowd of Divines in search of Preferment , my Thoughts returned to the perplexing Question upon which I have so often speculated in the past . Why should a man die at threescore years and ten when a Fish can retain its Youth for two or three centuries ? I have debated with myself a number of possible answers . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longer life of Carp and Pike might be due to the superiority of their Watery Element over our Air . But the lives of some subaqueous Creatures are short , while those of certain Birds exceed the human span . " The only Hypotheses to which I can see no manifest Objections are these : the Diet of such fish as Carp and Pike contains some substance which preserves their Bodies from the Decay which overtakes the greater number of Creatures even while they are alive ; alternatively the substance which prevents Decay is to be found within the Body of the Fish , especially , it would be reasonable to guess , in the Stomach , Liver , Bowels , and other Organs of Concoction and Assimilation . In the short-lived animals , such as Man , the Substances preventive of Decay must be presumed to be lacking . The question then arises whether these Substances can be introduced into the human Body from that of the Fish . History does not record any remarkable instances of longevity among the Ichthyophagy , nor have I ever observed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundance of Fish were specially long-lived . But we need not conclude from this that the Substance preventive of Decay can never be conveyed from Fish to Man . For Man cooks his Food before eating it , and we know by a thousand instances that the application of Heat profoundly modifies the nature of many Substances ; moreover , he throws away , as unfit for his Consumption , precisely those Organs of the Fish in which it is most reasonable to assume that the Substance preventive of Decay is contained . " " Christ ! " said Dr. Obispo , unable to contain himself any longer . " Do n't tell me that the old buzzard is going to eat raw fish guts ! " Bright behind their bifocals , Jeremy 's eyes had darted down to the bottom of the page and were already at the top of the next . " That 's exactly what he is doing , " he cried delightedly . " Listen to this . ' My first three attempts provoked an uncontrollable retching ; at the fourth I contrived to swallow what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three minutes my triumph was cut short by an access of vomiting . It was only after the ninth or tenth essay that I was able to swallow and retain even a few spoonfuls of the nauseating mincemeat . ' " " Talk of courage ! " said Dr. Obispo . " I 'd rather go through an air raid than that . " Jeremy meanwhile had not so much as raised his eyes from the book . " ' It is now a month , ' " he said , " ' since I began to test the truth of my Hypothesis , and I am now ingesting each day not less than six ounces of the raw , triturated Viscera of freshly opened Carp . ' " " And the fish , " said Dr. Obispo , slowly shaking his head , " has a greater variety of parasitic worms than any other animal . It makes my blood run cold even to hear about it . " " You need n't worry , " said Jeremy , who had gone on reading . " His Lordship does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' singular accession of Strength and Vigour during the month of March ' Not to mention ' Revival of appetite and Improved memory and powers of ratiocination . ' I like that ratiocination , " Jeremy put in appreciatively . " Such a nice period piece , do n't you think ? A real Chippendale word ! " He went on reading to himself and , after a little silence , announced triumphantly : " By April he 's riding again an hour on the bay gelding every afternoon . ' And the dose of what he calls his ' visceral and stercoraceous pap ' has been raised to ten ounces a day . " Dr. Obispo jumped up from his chair and began to walk excitedly up and down the room . " Damn it all ! " he shouted . " This is more than a joke . This is serious . Raw fish guts , intestinal flora , prevention of sterol poisoning , and rejuvenation . Rejuvenation ! " he repeated . " The Earl 's more cautious than you are , " said Jeremy . " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carp , to the Return of Spring , or to the Vis medicatrix Naturae , I am not yet able to determine . ' " Dr. Obispo nodded approvingly . " That 's the right spirit , " he said . " ' Time , ' " Jeremy continued , " ' will show ; that is , if I can force it to show , which I intend to do by persisting in my present Regimen . For I take it that my Hypothesis will be substantiated if , after persisting in it for some time longer , I shall have recovered not only my former state of Health , but a measure of Vigour not enjoyed since the passing of Youth . ' " " Good for him ! " Dr. Obispo exclaimed . " I only wish old Uncle Jo could look at things in that scientific way . Or , maybe , " he added , suddenly remembering the Nembutal and Mr. Stoyte 's childlike faith in his medical omniscience , " maybe I do n't wish it . It might have its inconveniences . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let 's go on with our case history , " he added . " In September he can ride for three hours at a stretch without fatigue , " said Jeremy . " And he 's renewing his acquaintance with Greek literature and thinks very poorly of Plato , I notice . After which we have no entry till 1799 . " " No entry till 1799 ! " Dr. Obispo repeated indignantly . " The old bastard ! Just when his case is getting really interesting he goes and leaves us in the dark . " Jeremy looked up from the note-book smiling . " Not entirely in the dark , " he said . " I 'll read you his first entry after the two years of silence and you can draw your own conclusions about the state of his intestinal flora . " He uttered a little cough and began to read in his Mrs. Gaskell manner . " ' May , 1799 . The most promiscuously abandoned Females , especially among Women of Quality , are often those to whom an unkind Nature has denied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constitutional Frigidity from the enjoyments of Pleasure , they are in everlasting rebellion against their Fate . The power which drives them on to multiply the number of their Gallantries is not Sensuality , but Hope ; not the wish to reiterate the experience of a familiar Bliss , but rather the aspiration towards a common and much vaunted Felicity which they themselves have had the misfortune never to know . To the Voluptuary , the woman of easy Virtue is often no less obnoxious , though for other reasons , than she seems to the severe Moralist . God preserve me in Future from any such Conquests as that which I made this Spring at Bath ! ' " Jeremy put down the book . " Do you still feel that you 've been left in the dark ? " he asked . XVI II The news that the Fifth Earl had had three illegitimate children at the age of eighty-one was announced in the notebook with a truly aristocratic understatement . No boasting , no self-congratulation . Just a brief , quiet statement sandwiched between the record of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the music of Mozart . One hundred and twenty years after the event , Dr. Obispo , who was not an English gentleman , exulted noisily , as though the achievement had been his own . " Three of them , " he shouted in his proletarian enthusiasm . " Three ! What do you think of that ? " Brought up in the same tradition as the Fifth Earl , Jeremy thought that it was n't bad , and went on reading . In 1820 the Earl had been ill again , but not severely ; and a three months ' course of raw carp 's entrails had restored him to his normal health , " the health , " MAGAZINE as he put it , " of a man in the flower of his age . " A year later , for the first time in a quarter of a century , he visited his nephew and niece , and was delighted to find that Caroline had become a shrew , that John was already bald and asthmatic , and that their eldest daughter was so monstrously fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in negotiations for the purchase of a house near Farnham . " That must be Selford , " Jeremy put in . " The house where these things came from . " He indicated the twenty-seven packing cases . " Where the two old ladies are living . " He continued his reading . " ' The house is old , dark , and inconvenient , but stands in sufficiently extensive Grounds upon an Eminence above the River Wey , whose southern bank at this point rises almost perpendicularly in a Cliff of yellow sandstone , to the height of perhaps one hundred and twenty feet . The Stone is soft and easily worked , a Circumstance which accounts for the existence beneath the house of very extensive Cellars which were dug , it would seem , about a Century ago , when the Vaults were used for the storage of smuggled Spirits and other goods on their way from the coasts of Hampshire and Sussex to the Metropolis . To allay the fears of his Wife , who dreads to lose a child in their subterranean meanders , the Farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his Cellarage ; but even that which remains presents the appearance of a veritable Catacomb . In Vaults such as these a man could be assured of all the Privacy required for the satisfaction of even the most eccentric Tastes . ' " Jeremy looked up over the top of his book . " That sounds a bit sinister , do n't you think ? " Dr. Obispo shrugged his shoulders . " Nobody can have enough privacy , " he said emphatically . " Well , he buys the house , " said Jeremy , who had been reading to himself . " And he has repairs and additions made in the Gothic manner . And an apartment is fitted up in the cellars , forty-five feet underground and at the end of a long passage . And to his delight he finds that there 's a subterranean well , and another shaft that goes down to a great depth and can be used as a privy . And the place is perfectly dry and has an ample supply of air , and . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obispo asked impatiently . " How should I know ? " Jeremy answered . He ran his eyes down the page . " At the moment , " he went on , " the old boy 's making a speech to the House of Lords in favor of the Reform Bill . " " By the way , how old was he when he made this speech ? " " Let me see . " Jeremy paused for a moment to make the calculation , then answered : " Ninety-four . " " Ninety-four I " Dr. Obispo repeated . " Well , if it was n't those fish guts , I do n't know what it was . " Jeremy turned back to the note-book . " At the beginning of 1833 he sees his nephew and niece again , on the occasion of Caroline 's sixty-fifth birthday . Altogether , as the Earl remarks , a most enjoyable evening . ' " " Nothing about those cellars , " Dr. Obispo complained . " No ; but his housekeeper , Kate , has been ill and he 's giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewal of interest . " And what happens ? " he asked . " She 's evidently alive , " said Jeremy . " Because here 's a little note in which he complains about the tediousness of too much female devotion . " " Listen to this , " Jeremy suddenly cried in a tone of excitement . " ' March , 1834 . By the criminal negligence of Kate , Priscilla has been allowed to escape from the subterranean place of confinement . Bearing as she does upon her Person the evidence that she has been for some weeks past the subject of my Investigations , she holds in her hands my Reputation and perhaps even my Liberty and " " I suppose this is what you were talking about before we started reading , " said Dr. Obispo . " The final scandal . What happened ? " " Well , I suppose the girl must have told her story , " Jeremy answered without looking up from the page before him . " Otherwise how do you account for the presence of this ' hostile Rabble ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send a company of militia from Guildford to protect the house from the rabble . And a magistrate has issued a warrant for his arrest ; but they 're not doing anything for the time being , on account of his age and position and the scandal of a public trial . Oh , and now they 've sent for John and Caroline . Which makes the old gentleman wildly angry . But he 's helpless . So they arrive at Selford ; Caroline in her orange wig and John , at seventy-two , looking at least twenty years older than I , who was already twenty-four when my Brother , then scarcely of age , had the imprudence to marry an Attorney 's Daughter and the richly merited misfortune to beget this Attorney 's Grandson whom I have always treated with the Contempt which his low Origin and feeble Intellect deserve , but to whom the negligence of a Strumpet has now given the Power to impose his Will upon me . ' " " One of those delightful family reunions , " said Dr. Obispo . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jeremy shook his head . " No details , " he said . " Just an outline of the negotiations . On March the seventeenth they tell him that he can avoid prosecution if he makes over his unentailed property by deed of gift , assigns them the revenues of the entailed estates , and consents to enter a private asylum . " " Pretty stiff conditions ! " " Which he refuses , " Jeremy continued , " on the morning of the eighteenth . " " Good for him ! " " They tell him he 'll be tried , condemned , and transported . To which he answers that he prefers transportation to a private asylum . " " ' March 20th . To-day , Robert Parsons , my Factor , returned from London bringing with him in the Coach , three strong boxes containing Gold coin and Bank Notes to the value of two hundred and eighteen thousand pounds , the product of the sale of my Securities and such Jewels , Plate , and works of Art as it was possible to dispose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I could have realized at least three hundred and fifty thousand pounds . This loss I can bear philosophically ; for the sum I have in hand is amply sufficient for my purposes ! " " What purpose ? " asked Dr. Obispo . Jeremy did not answer for a little while . Then he shook his head in bewilderment . " What on earth is happening now ? " he said . " Listen to this . ' My funeral will be conducted with all the Pomp befitting my exalted Rank and the eminence of my virtues . John and Caroline were miserly and ungrateful enough to object to the expense ; but I have insisted that my Obsequies shall cost not a penny less than Four Thousand Pounds . My only Regret is that I shall be unable to leave my subterranean Retreat to see the Pageantry of Woe and to study the expression of grief upon the withered faces of the new Earl and his Countess . To-night I shall go down with Kate to our Quarters in the Cellarage ; and to-morrow morning the World will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aged Pauper has already been con-veyed hither in Secret from Haslemere , and will take my place in the Coffin . After the Interment the New Earl and Countess will proceed at once to Gonister , where they will take up their Residence , leaving this house untenanted except for Parsons , who will serve as Caretaker and provide for our material wants . The Gold and Bank Notes brought by Parsons from London are already bestowed in a subterranean hiding place known only to myself , and it has been arranged that , every First of June so long as I live five thousand pounds in cash shall he handed over by myself to John , or to Caroline , or , in the event of their predeceasing me , to their Heir , or to some duly authorized Representative of the Family . By this arrangement , I flatter myself , I have placed them to fill the Place left vacant by the Affection they most certainly do not feel . ' And that 's all , " said Jeremy , looking up . " There 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the end of the book . Not another word of writing . " There was a long silence . Once more , Dr. Obispo got up and began to walk about the room . " And nobody knows how long the old buzzard lived on ? " he said at last . Jeremy shook his head . " Not outside the family . Perhaps those two old ladies . . . " Dr. Obispo halted in front of him , and banged the table with his fist . " I 'm taking the next boat to England , " he announced dramatically . ( To be concluded )
