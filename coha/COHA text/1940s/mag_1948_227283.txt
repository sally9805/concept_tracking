As angry as a loser in a sharp horse trade , the U.S. aluminum industry last week focused its wrath on the Economic Cooperation Administration . The U.S. , said the industry , was getting the short end of a very sharp deal . <P> EGA had allocated $26 million to Western European nations to buy aluminum . They had been using the dollars to buy Canadian ingots at 16 a lb . This gave the Europeans a surplus of aluminum . They shipped the metal to the U.S.-where there is a shortage-in the form of scrap . U.S. fabricators were paying as high as 25 a lb. for their European scrap . <P> Between April and September , eight EGA countries had shipped 45 million lbs . of aluminum to the U.S. ( almost half of it came from the United Kingdom ) , and shipments were increasing every month . Furthermore , other large European shipments were finding their way into Russia and satellite countries , and European traders were raking in big profits on the deals . At week 's end , EGA sadly admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps to stop it . EGA said the United Kingdom had already agreed to cut down its Canadian buying by the amount of aluminum sold to the U.S.
