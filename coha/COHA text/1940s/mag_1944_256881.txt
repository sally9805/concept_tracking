Dusty and footsore . Ulises Meja trudged through the jungles and over mountains , straight across Honduras . At last he reached his goal , knocked on the door of the famed horticulturist , Dr. Wilson Popenoe , head of the School of Pan-American Agriculture at Zamorano . The school was not scheduled to open for two months , but Ulises had come to beg for admission . Last week Ulises , now a prize pupil , was receiving the best training in farming that Central America offers . <P> Costing $750,000 to set up and $150,000 a year to run , the Zamorano school is a princely gift from the great United Fruit Co. to the restive people of its banana empire . Tuition is free . So is everything else , including clothes and elaborate dental work . Most of the 122 students come from poor Central American families of Indian blood , who could not possibly afford a U.S. education for their sons . Said one father of a successful applicant : " It was like winning the lottery . " <P> The school 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient up-to-date dirt farmers who will take the gospel of modern agriculture back to their native villages . At the end of the three-year course , the students get no degree , but they know how to farm . Says cagey Sam Zemurray , head of United Fruit : " If we give them degrees , they 'll go into politics . We want them to stay on the farm . " <P> From Fruit to Rice . The boys get up at 5 a.m. for classes and practical farm work . They experiment with nearly every standard crop , many new introductions . Emphasis is on dairying , a crying need in the milk-poor tropics . But other courses , run from fruit-tree grafting to rice cultivation . <P> The boys take their work more seriously than average U.S. students . But not all their time is spent at work . They hike and hunt , play baseball and football . One baseball team is called the Lechugas ( Lettuces ) ; another the " Guernseys . " The smallest class member is nicknamed " Atomic Weight . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to their parents ' farms . One Nicaraguan youth took a look at his father 's rice field . " No , papa , " he said sternly , " agriculture is not like this any more . " <P> Keenly aware of the distrust with which it is regarded throughout Central America , the United Fruit Co. leans over backward to keep the Zamorano school above suspicion . It has announced that it will not employ the graduates in its plantations . The school does not teach banana culture , admits no students because of political connections , markets no surplus produce for fear of being accused of exploiting the students ' labor . Said one relieved staff member , long a United Fruit employe : " We feel as pure as missionaries here . "
