Canada looked in the mirror last week and liked the ruddy cheeks it saw . In Ottawa , Finance Minister Douglas Abbott announced that the fiscal year would certainly end ( March 31 ) with the budget in balance . There was a $200,000,000 Government surplus at the end of eight months , instead of the $200,000,000 deficit expected . Better still , there might be cuts in taxes , although they probably would not be large . <P> No matter how Canada turned before her mirror , she found most prospects pleasing . There were still some inconveniences and shortages : meat was still rationed , refrigerators and washing machines were still hard to get . And there were far from enough houses to go around . But there were good things aplenty . <P> The big strikes which had cost about 4,500,000 man-working-days in 1946 were well out of the way ; as the year opened only 1,600 ( see below ) were on strike . Furthermore , the price line had been held . Looking at the U.S. , Canadians could feel smug because their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . They were up only 6% in the last 18 months , and business was excellent . <P> Satisfaction . Retail sales in Canada in 1946 , helped by a massive Christmas rush , passed the $5 billion mark for the first time in the Dominion 's history . The national income was at an alltime high : $9,400,000,000 . Canadian exports for the year , primed by nearly $2,000,000,000 worth of loans to foreign countries ( much of it for purchases in Canada ) , hit a record peacetime high : $2,300,000,000 . So did imports , at $1,900,000,000 . The bulk of the trade was with the U.S. Canada entertained 20,000,000 U.S. tourists who spent $200,000,000 ( up $40,000,000 from the year before ) . In 1946 , some 418,000,000 bushels of grain from Canada 's lush wheatland , some 1,250,000,000 lbs . of fish from her coasts , plus vast amounts of beef , pork , oats , barley , had helped feed Canada and the hungry world . <P> Anticipation . Best of all , the Dominion 's markets for 1947 seemed likely to be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills , the Dominion 's largest industry , had turned out nearly 7,000,000 tons of paper products worth $700,000,000-and customers all over the world were clamoring for still higher production . Despite a lack of sheet steel ( a shortage caused by U.S. and Canadian steel strikes ) , auto plants managed to build 178,000 cars and trucks , 3% above the average prewar production . And the pile of domestic and foreign orders was higher than ever . <P> Looking at the year ahead , Canadians could see humming production lines , jobs for almost everyone . They felt good .
