In the eastern suburbs of the city , coolies toiled on two mass tombs . Ashes and bodies of thousands of unknown invaders would rest there . In the northern and eastern suburbs torn and twisted Japanese corpses were being piled in neat heaps of 15 to 70 bodies each . <P> To the north , the remnants of an enemy expeditionary force of 100,000 slogged their way through the clinging goo of winter-flooded rice paddy fields as fast as heavy legs could take them . But they had a long way to go before they could reach the protection of their own artillery stalled along the Milo river . <P> The fourth Changsha campaign had ended in a smacking , resounding Chinese victory . The entire Japanese XI Army Corps had been involved . Once and for all the Japanese had tried to wipe out the Chinese threat along the mid-China chain of lakes ; and they had failed . They had caused considerable damage-had reduced most of the buildings of Yale-in-China to a soot-blackened monument of U.S. mission enterprise-but they had been chased away in no-uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculations , miring them in hub-deep , sucking mud . But mostly they had failed because they were faced by the only troops in Asia who could match them in war-wrung experience . They themselves had taught these Chinese veterans how to snuggle against protecting hills , how to gauge ranges and rations , how to hold out hopelessly or attack desperately and win . <P> The Chinese press , with too-human jubilation , rose to the occasion , helped a good story along . It boasted at first of 52,000 Japanese casualties . Later the military spokesman pared this to 30,000 casualties . At the front , the tough men of battle told correspondents they had nicked the enemy for only 21,000 . Among themselves , Chinese had learned to discount their press ta hua-big talk . They did not realize that Americans , unused to Chinese newspaper ways , were accepting Chungking statements at face value , that editorialists were using every sliver of American bright news from the dark Orient as an editorial springboard . <P> Last week , from Chungking , Chinese reported sallies of their forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Japanese . These were not harbingers of a final Chinese victory drive . But they were evidences that the Chinese Army was flexing its muscles and preparing for the day .
