PARTS OF A WORLD-Wallace Stevens - Knopf ( $2 ) . <P> This is the fourth book that gives the customers reason to stare hard at Wallace Stevens , famed poetical solipsist who wears the world in his hat . For many years this startling person has spent his normal working hours disguised as a lawyer-employe of Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co. , of which he is vice president . Betweenwhiles Stevens , now aged 63 , has kept adding to the bulk and scope of his poetical testament . <P> At first sight Stevens ' mental world looks like a five-ring circus of private hallucinations . This effect is partly deliberate , since Stevens is enough of an art snob to enjoy amazing an audience . But he is , despite his snobbery , one of the most seriously purposive poets alive . <P> As Stevens sees things , all that is esthetically ugly or morally wrong in the world proceeds from people 's misconceptions of reality . People misconceive reality , according to his diagnosis , because they think about it without imagination or by rote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world with all kinds of rusty cast-iron conceptions . <P> Parts of a World is a book to quicken people 's awareness of the difference between rote and imagination . His 60-odd lyrics are tailored to meet the specifications of his idea of an ordered world . They are all intended to show that the imagination is that faculty in man which enables him to tailor facts after his heart 's desire . The tailoring , however , is not to be done by mere wishful thinking , but by the bowing of the skilled workman over his fully apprehended job . <P> As a man whose job it is to make the words he uses make complete sense , Stevens fails-sometimes in an ugly way , sometimes scintillatingly , sometimes inspiringly . The voice of the poet deepens steadily right up to his viaticum , delivered to the world at war : <P> We live in a camp . . . . Stanzas of final peace <P> Lie in the heart 's residuum . . . . Amen . <P> <P> *The previous three : Harmonium , Ideas of Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
