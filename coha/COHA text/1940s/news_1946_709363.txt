txt The Government ordered building activity halted today unless it was to provide housing urgently needed by war veterans or meet other specific requirements . With few exceptions , no new construction or repairs to existing structures can be undertaken without the express authorization of the Government . The drastic moves , announced by John D. Small , Civilian Production Administrator , and Wilson W. ' Vyatt , National Housing Expediter , are intended to save materials desperately needed for veterans ' housing , and were decided upon after a thorough study of the housing emergency and the shortage of building materials . Only by prohibiting the starting of construction of less essential and deferrable building projects , said the officials , could enough materials be found to provide shelter for returning veterans and their families . Work Under Way Can Go On Construction work started befi fore today is not affected , provid-I ed that any of the materials which are to be an integral part of the structure have been incorporated in it on the site . According to unofficial opinions ventured by executives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as Veterans ' Emergency Housing Program Order No. 1 , means , for example , that if a cellar has been dug and concrete poured or bricks laid , the work can continue . However , if the digging is merely in progress and no concrete poured , the work will have to be stopped . Formal rulings on the above and the myriad other questions which CPA officials expect must await study by the agency 's lawyers . With estimated deficits ranging from 12 to as much as 40 per cent in the supply-and-demand situation for such key building materials as brick , lumber , plywood , plumbing fixtures and roofing materials , officials said that no other course was open . According to unofficial estimates made here today , the volume of building affected to some degree by today 's order will be $14,000,000,000 . Of this , $4,000 , - 000,000 was ' estimated to be home construction and the rest commercial , industrial , governmental and other types . Under ordinary circumstances , it was stated , most of the building materials would have gone into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reversed , making large quantities of building essentials available for the 2,700,000 dwelling units for veterans ' preference rental or sale in this year and next .

Government to Sift Own Plans The Federal Government 's construction projects also are exempted , it was added , but a special inter-agency committee is now being formed to screen such building activities at the source and , wherever possible , postpone them until the emergency has passed . " Public support is vital to the success of the veterans ' housing program , " Mr. Small said in describing today 's order . His agency , he revealed , was set- ting up a special CPA construction office in each of the Federal Housing Administration cities . Associated with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding citizens which will screen each project in the light of local peculiarities and determine , first , if it is essential , and if so , if it can be deferred . If a project is deferable . Mr. Small explained , it will be rejected , unless it has no adverse impact on the housing program , as regards labor supply or building materials . The committee will act in an advisory capacity and have the CPA district manager as chairman . Appeal from his decisions may be made to Washington . The veterans ' housing program came in for attention on both sides of the Capitol today . The House quickly approved a $253,727,000 emergency fund appropriation to provide temporary homes for war veterans and their families . With Representative Jessie Sumner , Republican , of Illinois , raising a lone voice against the measure , it was passed on a roll-call vote , 355 to 1 , and now goes to the Senate . The vote came just a few hours after the House Appropriations Committee approved the bill and sent it to the floor . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearings on the Patman Housing Bill , which the House passed without the premium-payments provision that the Administration sought to speed up production of scarce building materials . Mr. Wyatt , the Housing Expediter , was the day 's only witness and he urged the committee to restore the premium payments . which he termed an " indispensable tool " to accomplishment of the veterans ' housing program . He asked also that the Senate provide controls on the speculative resale ofl houses and building lots .
