 | And Naomi glanced keenly at Ruth ; and then , resuming her spinning , she said : " Indeed you have much yet to learn , my daughter . For you are still young and you were but a child when you married my first-born son whom I named Mahlon because he was so frail , so pale and puling , so sickly even in infancy . " " And you , too , like Rebekah , " said Ruth , " you loved Mahlon the frail one better than Chilion the robust one . " " That is so , " said Naomi . " And yet when I see how often it happens that the first-born are weaklings it seems not entirely without reason that the thoughtless peoples who worship strength are wont to sacrifice their first-born before their gods . For frail children are apt to grow up into weak and troubled men , too gentle for the struggle of life and too troubled by their own thoughtfulness which wins them the enmity of the strong . And perhaps that is why Jacob , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt insisted on giving his first blessing not to the elder but to the younger of Joseph 's two sons . " " And was Jacob himself the first-born son of his father ? " asked Ruth . " Well , " said Naomi hesitantly , " Jacob and Esau were twins  --  though it is said that Esau came forth first and Jacob had hold of his brother 's heel , which would make him the younger , and he should not have been the weaker ? but they were really twins and the rule therefore does not apply to them . But why the first-born should be the weaker of two sons of the same father I can not tell you , my daughter , only that it is more often so . With my Elimelech who was both strong and thoughtful it was as if he had divided the powers of his flesh and spirit between his two sons . Mahlon , the first-born , got his wise spirit , and Chilion , the second , got his lusty flesh . So much so that while delicate  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drawn to them . " " And was it for that reason , " asked Ruth , " that , when your sons married , Mahlon chose me and Chilion took Orpah ? " Naomi smiled as she spun . " Now that would be difficult to say , my daughter . You were both very young , you and Orpah , so young that you had not yet been taken up to the rites of spring . Yet even then as a maiden you were gentler , more earnest in spirit than Orpah , and it is possible that Mahlon preferred that in you . But there is no denying that men have a power over women too . So it may well be that  --  because gentle , thoughtful Mahlon , who feared the violence of the men of Moab and despised their thoughtlessness , married you , while Orpah was taken by lusty Chilion who , despite the teaching of his father and the laws of his forefathers , went up to the high place  --  that now you are here with me and Orpah remained there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again from her spinning into the dark eyes of Ruth . " Now tell me truly , my daughter , were not you , too , tempted at times by the fierce lustful ways of those princes of Moab ? " And Ruth said : " I can not deny that the sight of their manly strength sometimes moved me in a way gentle Mahlon never did  --  so that my flesh fainted in the presence of their lust ; but I ? " And she stopped speaking . " But , " said Naomi , " even in the little time you lived with my gentle Mahlon you had learned from him what Moses knew and taught the children of Israel  --  that , untamed in man , his joyous life-giving lust turns to a dreadful death-dealing thing  --  which Mahlon saw when his brother Chilion died of the foul disease he had got on the high place . " She mused sadly a moment over her spinping.  | " My Elimelech used to say , From the forest itself comes the handle of the axe that fells it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own destruction . And man can not be a mere animal : he is either better than the beast , or he is worse . All the same it is a pity my poor Mahlon had not got a little of his brother 's robust lustiness , then he would have been like his father , both wise and strong , and he would have lived to make you as good a husband as Elimelech made me  --  for all his foolish pride . " And Naomi sighed fondly and smiled as she spun . " And is it not curious , my daughter , that a woman can yet love her husband and her sons though she sees plainly all their faults ; while it seems that a man , to love a woman , must see no fault in her . " And she raised her quavering voice again and sang : Lo thou art all fair , my love ; And there is no blemish in thee . " Thus sing the men of Israel . And it is his vision of her , not the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why , when a good man loves a woman , he has the power to make her a better woman . But however good a man may be he must above all be manly to make a full and happy woman of the maiden he marries . And my frail , thoughtful Mahlon was good but not manly  --  not much of a mate for you . " And her wise old eyes looked again into the dark troubled young ones beside her . " Yes , my daughter , I have known ; though Elimelech used to say : The heart knows its own bitterness ; And even with its joy no other can meddle . " Ruth said : " It is strange that among the men of Moab I never saw one with the spirit of Mahlon , whom I greatly loved despite his frailty . "  | And Naomi said : " Perhaps it is because the Moabites sacrifice their first-born sons that there is not to be found among them such men , gentle , thoughtful and frail as my Mahlon was . But look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing downward . For as they descended with the River Arnon it had turned to a steaming stream rushing down a hot gulley of stones , naked but for prickly cactus and thorn ; and there at the foot of the rocky ravine the river fell into the dead Salt Sea , lying like molten metal under the sun that hung blood red over a maze of mountains on the farther shore . And then , looking out on that desolate expanse , Naomi told Ruth the old tale of Lot 's wife who , because she looked back at Sodom and Gemorrah , was turned to a pillar of salt . It was there , and Naomi pointed southward , at the foot of that very sea which was salt to this day , the old wives in Israel said , because a woman had looked back behind her . " And however that may be , " said Naomi to Ruth with her wise old smile , " you , my daughter , must put your life in Moab behind you now , and look back no more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy with anxiety for the future and longing for the peaceful past with gentle Mahlon , as they turned their sweating donkeys and went northward along the arid shore of the sea . Its leaden waters hardly rippled beneath the hot heavy wind which blew at sunset over that silent uninhabited place of evil-smelling sand , bare burnt hills , and beetling cliffs . And when the sun sank behind the mountains they stopped by a brook running into the sea and washed and made them a meal of bread and cheese and dried figs ; and they gathered dry thorn bushes and made a ring of fire around their resting place to keep away the howling  | jackals and the yelping foxes which they heard all the night in their fitful sleep . Once Naomi woke Ruth and pointed with trembling fingers to the shining eyes of some wild beast glaring at them from the darkness beyond the dying fire . And Ruth overcame her own fears and rose up and replenished the fire and fashioned a sling and beat off the beast with stones she slung at it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrified old woman until she slept again ... . The next day they continued northward along the seashore . And riding her dove-gray donkey in the bright warm daylight Naomi was again of good cheer and resumed her spinning and her talk , laughing at her fears of the night before .... " And men like to think , " she said , " that we are all and always like that , fearful creatures , dependent on them for our safety . Even my Elimelech who was so strong seemed troubled sometimes by any sign of a strength of spirit I might have learned from him ; and he seemed happiest when he was comforting me in my foolish fearfulness as you did last night , my daughter . But you , who might have learned timidity from poor Mahlon , are as courageous as those women of valor whom the men of Israel celebrate in a song I shall teach you some day . For though , like most men , the Israelites do not appear to want their own wives to be strong , still do they cherish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abraham 's Sarah and Isaac 's Rebekah and Jacob 's Rachel , and of prophetesses like Miriam the sister of Moses and Zipporah the Midianitess , his wife , who circumcised her own son and saved the life of Moses from the wrath of God . And the men of Israel even sing the praises of valiant women who have won battles for them . " " And was Jael , of whom thou didst speak to the revelers ,  | was she who killed Sisera one of these ? " asked Ruth , and her dark eyes shone with new fire which the words of Naomi had kindled , for Ruth had a vision of becoming herself a renowned woman in Israel . " Yes , Jael , though she was not one of their own women but the wife of a Kenite , ' said Naomi , ceasing her spinning and proudly raising her head . " And Deborah , too ? Deborah the great woman of God ! " " Tell me of them , " begged Ruth , " of the valiant women in Israel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sixty years since Moses left them and weakened by their backsliding to Baal worship , feared to come forth and fight the gathering hosts of King Jabin of Canaan and his general , Sisera , in the north country , it was valiant Deborah who roused the men of Israel to battle . Princes and shepherds came to her call out of all the tribes . And Deborah called upon the Lord God of Israel for help and he , too , heard her call and it is said that the stars in their courses fought against Sisera and the River Kishon rose up and swept his fallen army away and Sisera fled and sought refuge in the tent of Heber the Kenite . " " But what of Jael ? " asked Ruth . " Tell me what Jael did . " " Jael was the wife of Heber , one of the . Kenites who were friendly to Israel . And it is told in our Book of Remembrance that she went out to meet Sisera and said to him , Turn in , my lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tent and lay down and she covered him with a rug . And he said to her , Give me , I pray thee , a little water to drink ; for I am thirsty . And she opened a skin of milk and gave him to drink . And he said to her , Stand in the door of the tent and it shall be when any man doth  | come and inquire of thee and say , Is there any man here ? that thou shalt say , No . Then Jael took a tent pin and she took a hammer in her hand and went softly to him and smote the pin into his temples , and it pierced through into the ground . " Then , seeing the look of horror in the eyes of Ruth , Naomi said : " I tell this to you who are going to be a woman in Israel only to prove that though in the land of Israel as in other lands men are wont to think of women as weak and unreliable , changing in spirit with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in Israel shown themselves firm and strong as any man , sometimes when need be even more determined than their men . And to this day the men of Israel sing of Jael , who like yourself , Ruth , was not one of their women ; " and she raised up her old voice and sang : Blessed above women shall Jael be , Blessed shall she be above women in the tent ! He asked for water , and she gave him milk ; She brought him butter in a lordly dish . She put her hand to the nail , And her right hand to the workman 's hammer ; And with the hammer she smote Sisera . She smote through his head , Yea , she pierced and struck through his temples . At her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay : At her feet he bowed , he fell : Where he bowed , there he fell down dead . " And Naomi said : " Now sing it with me . " Then Ruth 's young voice joined with Naomi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . . .  | and the two women sang together , the elder teaching the younger , their voices ringing bravely against the forbidding rocks as they rode northward skirting the rim of the dead and silent sea . Late that afternoon the narrow track they followed climbed to a shelf on a cliff overhanging the sea , and toward evening the hungry donkeys , picking their way among heaps of rubble in which lay shards of old pottery , stopped to crop the sparse grass springing up on a hillock surmounted by crumbling walls . And there was a well of water and a pair of palm trees ; so the two women camped there for the night . " This is the ruins of an ancient fortified city , " said Naomi , preparing a place under the palms for their meal while Ruth laid the fires . " Doubtless the men of Reuben took it from the men of Sihon who dwelt here before the Israelites returned from bondage in Egypt . And this is also odd about the men of Israel : that they are by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto you ' and Unto you peace ' so that their more violent and less thoughtful neighbors are wont to consider them slavishly fearful of might . And yet given a just cause and aroused to anger they can be as violent and ruthless as their enemies , though Thou shalt not murder is one of the ten commandments which Moses brought them down from Mount Sinai . Thus you will find the men of Israel curiously divided in spirit and often tormented within themselves , especially those who , like my Elimelech , are both strong and thoughtful . The spirit of that Moabite prince who took Orpah up to the high place was not so divided . Like any animal he lives for the satisfaction of his untamed appetites . He is not troubled about his violence and his lust and he would no more think of restraining them than  | would a wild tiger . Nor do his gods , which are lovers of violence and lust , command him to be otherwise . " " Yet , on the other hand , " said Ruth as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my Mahlon was divided in spirit . Though he was troubled by the abominations of Moab and the frailty of his own flesh , a more peaceable man never lived , always gentle and self-restrained . " Naomi said : " You must not judge all the men of Israel by poor Mahlon . It is easy enough for a frail man to be virtuous . If you had lived with a man like my Elimelech you would know what I mean . But you will see for yourself when you come in to Judah . And now let us lie down and rest . For I am weary as if I had been wandering forty years in the wilderness like Moses toward the promised land . Tomorrow if all goes well we should reach the River Jordan . " So they laid them down to sleep in the circle of fires Ruth had made ; but Naomi roused Ruth again to say that there was not one but a host of yellow-eyed beasts moving all about them , until Ruth showed her that it was but a flock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm fronds in the night breeze . And all the next day they followed the narrow track northward along the cliffs above the edge of the silent sea , but because Naomi 's donkey , that dove-gray creature with deceptive liquid eyes , got balky as Balaam 's ass and would not go on without being beaten , they did not reach Jordan by sunset and had to make camp again by the way , within sight of a high mountain peak rising up from the plain to the east . And Ruth said as they lay down to rest : " That is Mount Peor , is it not ? I have heard my father tell of it with awe ; for it is the home of his gods  --  Baal-Peor and his wife Ashtar.  | And I have heard him speak of it in anger , too , as the place where Balaam was brought by our King Balak to curse the Israelites but was moved instead to bless them . " And Naomi said : " It is often so between the Israelites and their enemies who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom Balaam said , looking down on them from that mountain : Lo , it is a people that dwell alone , And shall not be reckoned among the nations . But to the children of Israel that is not Mount Peor but Mount Nebo where weary Moses after patiently leading the children of Israel through the desert went up to look out on the land the Lord God of Israel had promised them , but which the Lord had told Moses he would not enter with them . " " And why , " asked Ruth , " was Moses denied entry into the promised land after leading his people all that long way through the wilderness ? I , who have come only from Moab and now look forward so eagerly to our arrival in Judah , can easily imagine how his heart must have grieved him as Moses stood there on Mount Nebo . Why then did the Lord forbid him to go into the land ? " Naomi said : " Long before , when they had come into the wilderness of Zin where there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Aaron , saying , Wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt , to bring us into this evil place ? And the Lord gave Moses a rod and instructed him to speak to a rock in the name of the Lord and it would give forth water . But Moses in his impatience did not speak to the rock as the Lord had told him ; he smote the rock with his rod , twice . And though the water came forth abundantly and the congregation drank , and  | their cattle , too , yet the Lord said to Moses and Aaron , Ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them . " And Ruth , lying beside Naomi , said : " But why did the Lord give Moses the rod if he did not wish him to strike the rock , only to speak to it ? Is it not strange that God gives a man the means to do wrong and then punishes him for not doing right ? " Naomi said : " Now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning when the Lord God of Israel set the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden and told Adam and Eve not to eat of it under pain of death . For the Almighty One does not prevent us from doing evil ; he lets us have the power to do both good and evil and bids us learn and heed his laws and choose between good and evil . So he gave Moses the rod with which he might strike though he bid him speak to the rock . " " But surely , " said Ruth , " the impatience of Moses on that occasion was forgiveable . " " To anyone but the Lord God of Israel , " said Naomi . " For the God of Israel , though he is jealous of all other gods and wrathfully chastises his people for their backsliding to Baal worship , demands of his people that each one curb his spirit , submitting faithfully to the instruction of the Almighty One . So Moses , who had in his impatience displayed his own power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was punished by being kept out of the promised land , the land flowing with milk and honey that he could see plainly from Nebo ; and there he died alone , and no one knows where he was buried . " And Ruth said : " Would that Moses were still alive ; for surely he , who thought to teach the Israelites forbearance  | for the stranger while they were yet wandering in the wilderness , would have befriended me  --  for all that he said a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of Israel . " And she looked up at the mountain whose summit under the darkling sky shone blood red in the last light of the setting sun . And Naomi said : " Some say he was murdered and his body hidden away by those who hated him for the hardship they had suffered in the flight from Egypt and wished he had left them there in bondage instead of bringing them out to serve this jealous God , who is one God yet is everywhere and commands them to such self-restraint as most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave of Moses was hidden lest it become a shrine where his fellow men whom he had brought to freedom might come and bow down and worship him ; and that would be abominable to their jealous God who differs from the gods of other men in that he is singular where they are many and while they are capricious he is lawful  --  not to be swayed or placated by cruel sacrifices , or celebrated in lewd and beastly rites , but served in learning and obeying his commandments which are the laws of all creation and of life . And it is this search for God 's will under leaders like Moses who was concerned not merely with the acts of men but with their desires and their thoughts , it is this that has troubled the spirits of the strong and thoughtful men of Israel . They are torn between the promptings of their flesh and the commandments of their austere God who is the Lord of all creation yet himself has no wife . But a true man needs both . For without his lusty body he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no more than the brute beast . But the man who has both , I can tell you , is not easy for a woman to live with . Just as he spends a good  | part of his life learning the laws of God , you must spend a good part of your life learning his laws . And sometimes it seems easier for a woman to learn the laws of God than of a man . Consider even Moses , the greatest of them , of whom it is said : The man Moses was very meek , above all the men which were upon the Earth ; yet he killed an Egyptian who was smiting a Hebrew slave ; and in his impatience he smote the rock for water , as I have just told you ; and again in his anger at sight of the Israelites worshiping a golden calf he broke the tablets of the law which he brought down from Sinai . But only with knowledge can we avoid or overcome difficulties and reap rewards in living with such men . And when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely love him , as I loved my Elimelech . So despite all I have borne and suffered yet do I counsel you to find such a man in Judah and marry him . For our Mahlon is gone forever , and what the Lord God said to Adam : It is not good that the man should , be alone , is it not equally true of woman ? " said Naomi to Ruth . But to this Ruth made no reply , for she was fast asleep . So Naomi leaned over and kissed her gently , and she covered her well with the warm shaggy quilt of goat 's hair and lay down to sleep beside her ... . In the morning they went westward again , rounding the northern end of the Salt Sea and approaching the ford of Jordan , which there falls into the sea . And there they came again within sight of the King 's highway and they saw far distant a caravan coming : a band of Moabite marauders returning from a raid in the land of Israel , their swift camels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing what looked like two women on donkeys in the distance two men moved from the course of the caravan and rode toward them . And fortunate it was that there were cavernous rocks nearby , and Naomi made Ruth go quickly into hiding among them with her white donkey . And Naomi took the sharp flint knife Elimelech had made her and she gave it to Ruth , saying , " I have no need of this ; me they will not molest . " And Ruth took the knife and hid it in her sleeve as she waited within a cave . And the old woman was apparently alone , struggling with her obstinate donkey when the two Moabites on their camels drew up beside her . And they were the two burly brothers , the twin princes of the City of Moab . They were young and strong but not handsome . Their bushy black eyebrows met over their noses , and their nostrils were thick and flat like those of their long-necked mounts and they had also the strong smell of their camels . " What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the old witch , Naomi . And where is our Ruth ? " he demanded , looking around for her . " I prevailed upon her to return two days ago , " said Naomi . " And I am alone with this cursed creature , this son of Belial that thinks he is Balaam 's ass and has seen the Angel of the Lord ! " and she spat into the face of the donkey , loudly calling down maledictions upon its ancestry . " Thou art lying , " said the Moabite , " for we would have met Ruth upon the highway when we set forth on this raid . " " And I would have sworn by Peor and Ashtar , " insisted the other , " that I saw from the distance a young woman with you , a pretty one . " " But that , " said Naomi , " was only the mirage of your  | male desire . I have known in my time what that is like . " " Is it possible ! " he said , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naomi returning his stare . " Men are so greedy ! At any age ! You have no idea how peaceful it is to be an old and unbeautiful woman , no longer sought after and hunted , as unmolested as a sun-bleached bone lying in the sand . " Then the two young men could not help laughing at her sally , but they kept looking around for some sign of Ruth , who stood very still with her donkey concealed in the cave not a stone 's throw away . And Ruth from her hiding place looked upon the two men and knew that if they discovered her there she would take her own life rather than return with them to the City of Moab . For she knew that she had been weaned forever from the bestial ways of the men of Moab and she could never abide them nor the slavish ways of their women . So she stood waiting within the cave with the sharp flint knife in her hand , ready , if one of them came upon her , to strike him down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Naomi saying : " We did not come by the highway . We came by the shore of the Salt Sea . And if you go back that way you will overtake Ruth . That is if no other man has yet come upon her . " And unflinching the old woman returned the gaze of the twin brothers until one of them suddenly leaned down from his camel and kissed her withered cheek saying , " That is for sending her back . " Then he wheeled his camel , and the two rode off , laughing aloud , to rejoin their band which then turned and went south by the seashore . And when they were out of sight Ruth came from her hiding place , laughing too at Naomi who stood rubbing her wrinkled face .  | " A man in heat will kiss anything ! " the old woman muttered , though she seemed not entirely displeased as she said it . Then she looked up at the sky . With a rising wind the heavens had darkened to the color of the earth for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being weary and fearful of the river crossing , said : " Let us wait until after the storm . " But Ruth , more fearful now of Moabite men than of storms , pleaded that they hasten to cross the Jordan before another caravan came . Once over in Judah among the Israelites they would be safer , she thought . They arrived at the ford in a dark gale ; the wind-driven sand stung their faces ; and the river was swollen with the waters of spring . Wild buffalo wallowed in the flooded banks among the rattling reeds of papyrus . But another caravan had appeared on the highway and they determined to cross over at once . So they urged their donkeys into the turbulent stream , Ruth ahead and leading Naomi 's reluctant donkey . And the swift mud-laden water washed over their feet ; but they pressed on and had got safely to midstream when Naomi 's gray beast , as if remembering her recent mistreatment , balked and stopped . " Dear donkey , sweet donkey ! " pleaded the old woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not mean to spit upon you . It was only to fool those stupid men .... " But the devilish donkey stood still and shook himself hard , until Naomi slipped from his back into the swirling brown water and would have been swept away had not Ruth come to her rescue and lifted her up again on the donkey 's back and beat the beast into carrying her over to the shore . Then , more dead than alive , Naomi lay in the shelter of a tree while the storm passed and Ruth gathered wood for  | a fire . And when the old woman was rested and revived she gave fervent thanks to the Lord God of Israel for bringing them safely into the land of Judah , though she remarked to Ruth a bit plaintively that the Lord had not seen fit to do for two women what he had done for Joshua and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant when they came to pass over Jordan on their way to Jericho  --  for them he had stopped the river which was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Naomi , " that was just about this time of year no more than a hundred years ago  --  but the Lord God of Israel has not been as generous with his miracles to women as to men . He did indeed bring Sarah to childbed with Isaac when she was ninety years old ; but she had provoked him to it by laughing at the possibility until he said , Is anything too hard for the Lord ? That was a rare case . And perhaps it is because the Lord rarely performs miracles for women that we are prone to take things in our own hands . For the Lord God of Israel is certainly a man 's god ; and the land of Israel like the rest of this world is a man 's world . " Nevertheless , as they dried their drenched and muddy garments by the fire she gave praise again to the men of Judah , saying how much better they treated their women than did the men of Ammon and Moab , who looked to women only for the satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judah are not lusty , " she hastened to assure Ruth , as she spread out her sodden wool to dry before the fire . " Indeed I do not mean you to think they are entirely unlike other men . As Moses said : All men are brothers . But there are differences in brothers ; consider Cain and Abel ; Jacob and Esau . And was not the father of Moab the son of the eldest daughter of Lot who was a brother to Abraham  --  which makes Moab and Israel kin ; and I have  | known Israelites as uncouth as the rudest Moabite . I mean merely to say that the men of Israel are different in that they extol and respect the women they have loved , even when they are old  --  as witness the story of Abraham and old Sarah in the matter of her son Isaac against Hagar 's Ishmael ; they are not like the men of other nations who have no regard for women when they no longer serve their lust . And the men of Israel , " said Naomi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lewdness , because their God has forbid them adultery and all the abominations of Ammon and Moab . The Lord God of Israel is not a lover of lust but a lover of love , which is not merely of the flesh but of the spirit . Other nations learn only to fear their gods . The Israelites are taught : And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , with all thy soul , and with all thy might . And he has commanded them to honor not only their fathers but their mothers . And it is said that when Moses brought down God 's commandments from Sinai and the men were loath to accept them , Moses taught them first to the women , because women are more sensible and because women teach their children and because women can beguile men into doing not only what is evil but what is good . Hence the men of Israel cherish their women and their children , and women and children have played a great part in the history of Israel , even though it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having dried out some wool she began spinning again . " The very name of our great Moses means child , and were it not for two women  --  his mother who saved him alive despite Pharaoh 's edict that all male Israelite children be slain , and the daughter of Pharaoh who rescued him from the bulrushes where his mother had hid him  --  were it not for those two women , that child would not have lived to lead Israel out  | of bondage and bring them the laws of the Lord our God . And never would the Israelites sacrifice a child  --  since the time of Abraham to whom the Lord God appeared to prevent the sacrifice of his beloved son Isaac , bringing him a scapegoat instead . " She glanced into Ruth 's dark eyes . " You have wanted a child , have you not , my daughter ? " Ruth said : " During my marriage to Mahlon I was torn between my deep desire for a child and my dread that should I bear a daughter she would grow up to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should I bear a son he would surely be sacrificed to cruel Chemosh . And so great was my dread that though there were times when I longed for a lustier Mahlon there were also times , especially in the spring , when I was grateful that he lacked the vigor to give me a child . But now tell me this , Naomi : if it is indeed true that first-born sons are apt to be frail children and troubled men why did the Lord God not let Abraham sacrifice Isaac ? " And Naomi said : " We are told in our Book of Remembrance that God wished to prove Abraham , and he bid him take his beloved son Isaac up on Mount Moriah there to sacrifice him . And we are told how Abraham went to do God 's bidding and took his son Isaac and two of his young men to accompany him . And we are told that Abraham left the two young men at the foot of the mountain and took the fire and the knife and went up alone with his small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that God , having proved him , then prevented him from making the sacrifice and provided the scapegoat . Now , I am but a woman and I do not mean to deny the story of Abraham , that great forefather of Israel . But men have their own way of telling a story ; and that this man Abraham was very shrewd , even before his God , may be seen in  | the matter of his having beat God down from fifty to ten as the least number of virtuous men for whose sake the evil city of Sodom might be spared . So I venture to say that Abraham who had not feared to teach his God mercy would want to teach his fellow man mercy . And that , it seems to me , is what he was doing on Mount Moriah . What Abraham meant by that story about the scapegoat is that the Lord though fierce in his just anger is yet a god of mercy , the life-giving father of all mankind , his children , loving the weak no less than the strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this he had already made clear before Isaac was born when he ordered Abraham to circumcise himself and all the males of his tribe , including his son Ishmael  --  commanding that that small bit of their flesh be taken from every male child born thereafter as a covenant with the Lord in lieu of a human sacrifice , which is done among all the children of Israel to this day . But to return to Isaac of whom you inquired : As it turned out , however , Isaac grew up into no great figure of a man , the least of the forefathers of Israel . He was too much attached to his mother , for whose death he grieved until his father got him a wife Rebekah to take her place ; and I sometimes think it may be that our first-born sons are apt to be weaklings because we coddle them more than the others . Certainly Isaac was not like his father Abraham who was both shrewd and strong . " " And was Abraham himself the second son of his father ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes upward in thought , counting on her gnarled fingers until she said , uncomfortably : " No , he was not . Abraham was the firstborn son of Terah . But , " and she hastily took up her spinning again , " that proves nothing . I am not like the men :  | I do not say that what has often been so , must always be so . Even God Almighty has been known more than once to break his laws for the sake of his children  --  at least for the men . Not only did he part the Jordan for Joshua as he had parted the Red Sea for Moses , but he stopped the setting sun and the rising moon for Joshua at the battle of Jericho . No , Abraham was a first-born son and he was strong , but he was exceptional , " said Naomi firmly . " But was not Isaac really the second son of Abraham ? " asked Ruth , whose eager inquiry was not to be stopped by the sharp glance Naomi gave her : " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Hagar before Sarah bore Isaac ? " " Yes , Ishmael , " said Naomi , impatiently . " But he had been sent away ; he did not count , because Isaac was Abraham 's first-born by Sarah . And Isaac was certainly a weakling for , when he went to Gerar and opened his father 's wells which the Philistines had filled up , he could not contend with the herdsmen of Gerar but moved off before them from one well to another . And then he became blind , and then was deceived by his wife Rebekah into giving Jacob the blessing instead of Esau , all of which proves what I say  --  well , at least that Isaac was a weakling . Yet out of his weakness came a great good , came Jacob ? because of that weakness Jacob became the father of all Israel ! " " And because of the weakness of Mahlon , " said Ruth gravely , " I was weaned away from the abominations of Moab and have turned my face , my heart and my soul , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And while the other gods , like cruel Chemosh , say : Sacrifice the weak , for only the strong should survive , the Lord God of Israel says : Save the weak  | and help them survive , and let all men , weak and strong , learn the laws of God by which they may live . For out of the gentle thoughtfulness of the weak can come great goodness . In Israel it is the custom to dedicate first-born sons to the service of the Lord , for the Lord said to Moses : The first born of thy sons shalt thou give to me  --  not to be slaughtered in sacrifice but to learn his commandments which are for life ; and Mahlon had been well taught by his father . And who knows but that because of the spirit of frail Mahlon which turned you from Moab there may yet come from your womb strong sons in Israel , and from them sons who will be very great in Israel . " But Ruth said : " I have still no wish for another man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , " said Naomi , looking at the golden amulets on Ruth 's brow , each bearing the naked , full-breasted figure of Ashtar , " tell me now , why do you still wear those Moabite charms ? " And Ruth was silent as she looked away for a moment from those keen old eyes . Then she returned their questioning gaze and said : " When I knew that Mahlon could give me no child I went to my mother . And she got from the priest and gave me the amulets to rouse up the passion of Mahlon , for in Moab these golden charms , which only the daughters of princes may wear , were said to have potent magic with men . And my mother bid me also to go up to the spring rites which would make me fertile . And though I was then sorely tempted I did not go up to the high place because Mahlon forbid it me , saying that in the eyes of the Lord God of Israel , the one Almighty God , those rites were abominable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things as amulets , and he let me wear these in order to prove it . And alas it was indeed so , for  | nothing came of my wearing them . But one day when I had ceased wearing them , Mahlon said that they brought out the beauty of my brow , so I wore them thereafter to please him and I have continued to wear them because they remind me of Mahlon and how he would chant , Lo , thou art beautiful , my beloved , when I put them on before him . " And Naomi said sadly : " A woman has need of children , " looking upon the swift river where it ran out into the desolate Salt Sea . " Lacking a child to love , the heart of a woman , though she may get much love from men , must grow bitter in time  --  just as that sea , lacking an outlet , remains bitter though all the sweet water of Jordan pours endlessly into it . " " Thou art very wise , Naomi , " said Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " I sorely wish that you had a son . I would teach him all I have learned from life ; and he would teach his sons and they would be wise men in Israel and they would write down my wisdom in books and my life would not be lost in the death of my sons but would be redeemed , and the name of Elimelech and of Mahlon would be preserved upon the earth . " Ruth said : " And wouldst thou teach my child all those laws of the Lord God of Israel ? " And Naomi said : " Indeed I would , as Moses instructed us saying : And these words which I command thee this day shall be upon thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children . But why do you ask this ? " And Ruth said : " This seems no child 's God , this Lord of unchanging laws , who is not to be swayed like the gods of Moab by the wishes and gifts of his children . " Naomi smiled then and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes your child would have us . And what joy it would be for me to hold him in my arms and take him into my bosom , and be nurse to him and sing him sweet songs : For lo , the winter is past , " Naomi sang softly in her quavering old voice , swaying back and forth as she sang : The rain is over and gone . And Ruth , too , took up the song in her sweet voice : The flowers appear on the earth , rocking over her empty arms as she sang ; The time of the singing of birds is come And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land ... . And both women , the old and the young , as their song died away sat looking with wistful delight into the dying fire , until Naomi roused herself saying : " But sitting down here by Jordan will not get you with child , my daughter . Come now , let us be on our way up to Bethlehem and see if there is yet a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose up saying : " But even if I wished for another husband , say , for the sake of a child  --  what Israelite in his own land among his own women would look with favor upon me  --  a woman of Moab ? " Naomi , smiling sagely , looked at Ruth in her worn and bedraggled garments and said : " It , would help matters if you were better clothed ; but even the most austere man of Judah can not fail to see your beauty , and the Lord God of Israel , who has instructed his children to be fruitful and multiply , will surely provide for you . " And then suddenly  | bethinking herself Naomi said : " But to be sure , living so long in Moab I had forgotten our levirate law ! " " And what is that ? " asked Ruth . " That it is the right , " said Naomi , " and indeed the duty of the brother-in-law of a childless widow to marry her and give her a son to inherit and redeem the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And where there is no brother-in-law , the nearest kinsman has the right . Now I am naturally too old to beget an heir to the land Elimelech left in Judah ; but you , my daughter , shall do that ! " said Naomi eagerly . " And you shall preserve the name of Mahlon upon it ! I know not who remains of the family of Elimelech in Bethlehem , but we shall see when we get there ! " But Ruth shook her head and said : " Much as a son would delight me , and thee too , Naomi  --  and much as I would wish to preserve the name of Mahlon upon his inheritance  --  dost thou think I would want any other man for the father of my son than Mahlon whom I dearly loved ? And dost thou think I would have happiness married to a man who did so because of a law ? " Naomi shrugged her thin shoulders and smiling patiently said : " We shall see , we shall see . Come now ; let us go on up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day at sunrise they left the valley of Jordan and urged their donkeys , the dove-gray and the milk-white one , up the rugged hills of Judah , the hills of the ancient homeland which the children of Israel had terraced with stone walls and turned with loving labor into a fertile and fruitful garden . There were snowy-blossoming orchards of pear and plum and the lilac clouds of almond trees and silver-green groves of twisted old olives . There were well-pruned vineyards and rows of leafy fig trees laden with ripening fruit and  | the flame-flowered pomegranates . And in the hollows between the hills lay well-watered green pastures where flocks of fat sheep and bleating lambs grazed peacefully while their shepherds stood guard with their crooks or sat playing rustic and reedy music on their pipes . And one stood singing : The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want He maketh me to lie down in green pastures .. . Everywhere flowers bloomed in the fields and by the peaceful farmhouses : roses and oleanders , white jasmine and yellow mimosa , and their fragrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearths and the song of the lark and the call of the cuckoo to the high blue sky where small clouds sailed , molten gold in the morning sunlight . And Naomi said : " Is it now to be wondered that Balaam said when King Balak of Moab called him to curse the Israelites : How goodly are thy tents , O Jacob , And thy tabernacles , O Israel ! " And they came to a flourishing garden of vegetables with a fig tree whose fruit was ripe , and Naomi said : " I am hungry for fresh food , let us go in and eat . " And Ruth said : " Hast thou no fear that the owner of the garden may come ? In Moab the owner would whip you for trespassing . " And Naomi said : " Moses said , When thou comest into thy neighbor 's vineyard , then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure ; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel . And this he said on the way here , long before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the garden and ate their fill of figs and vegetables and then they went on . And when they passed a house where a woman sat milking the goats for her children who stood waiting around her , " Peace unto you ! " she cried to them , offering them of the milk ; and they answered , " To you , peace ! " and they stopped and drank gratefully of the milk and the woman looked with curiosity upon the golden amulets Ruth wore until Ruth said to her that she was from Moab . Then the woman turned from Ruth and pointed to a pillar of smoke rising up from the valley northward toward Debir and she told with bitterness how the Moabite raiders had destroyed a defenceless village in the night . The inhabitants they had killed or driven away ; and in their fields not a stem , not a blade of grass was left ; for what the camels of the Moabites had not devoured their broad hoofs had trampled down . And Ruth was sorely distressed at the woman 's tale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curly haired , held up for her to see the bow and arrow he was fashioning . " Have you seen any raiders ? " he asked . " This is for the Philistine giants . " And he let fly an arrow at a tree . And Naomi said to Ruth as they went on : " Thus from childhood are the men of Israel divided in their spirits , dreaming and speaking of peace and preparing for war . For as Balaam rightly said , It is a people that dwell alone . They are encircled by enemies . Marauders come not only from Moab on the east but from Ammon too , and from the Philistines on the west and from the Arameans on the north and from Edom and Midian and Amalek on the south . And though the Israelites have been commanded by Moses to consider kindly the stranger among them it is understandable , is it not , my daughter , that they look with suspicion upon the stranger among them . "  | And Ruth said sadly : " It is indeed understandable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow which mark me for a stranger ; but I am loath to do so out of fear . " And Naomi said : " Nor would I have you who came here out of love do anything out of fear in Israel . But consider that we have enemies in our very midst ! See there where the Jebusites live on the border between Judah and Benjamin ! " And she pointed up to where the bastioned walls of Jerusalem rose like a crenelated crown from the hills , gleaming in the golden sunlight . And so they came toward noon to the road running by the great wall of Jerusalem high and mighty with its two tall gate towers , the Gate of Gihon and the Gate of the Fountain . And the highway was busy with travelers . Many went in and out of the gates of the city of the Jebusites ; and there was a constant throng of those traveling to and from the Israelite towns along the highway  --  northward to Gibeah and Bethel in Benjamin and to Shiloh in the hill country of Ephraim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagons for the cedars of Lebanon ; and southward to Bethlehem in Judah , and to Hebron and Beersheba on the way down into Egypt with merchant caravans . And it was easy to distinguish which were the Israelites among the travelers , because , as Naomi pointed out to Ruth , these wore fringes at the four corners of their garments in accordance with the instructions of Moses ? which Elimelech and his sons had not adhered to in Moab because of their fear of being marked as strangers among the Moabites . And as Ruth and Naomi approached the city they saw that on top of the thick wall of Jerusalem was gathered a crowd of the Jebusites ; for there by the roadside , to divert passers-by and to gather some shekels from them , a troupe  | of traveling storytellers had made their stage against the great stones of the wall in a recess between two bastions of the Gate of the Fountain . They were strangely garbed as if in the raiment of other times and places ; and they played out their stories in pantomime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two women stopped their donkeys on the edge of the throng of passers-by which had gathered to watch the play of the storytellers , some standing , some seated upon their camels and donkeys . " These storytellers are Israelites , " said Naomi to Ruth , to whom it was altogether strange ; " and they are playing out parts of the story of the children of Israel . This one they are telling now is the end of the story of Jacob . See , it is just as I told you . Old Jacob , sitting upon his bed , crosses his arms to place his right hand on the head of the younger of the two sons of Joseph , who stands there behind them dressed like an Egyptian prince . See , he is trying to prevent his father from exchanging the blessings , although he himself was the youngest of Jacob 's sons . But the old man insists on having it his way  --  on giving the first blessing to Ephraim the younger . And now Jacob draws his feet up on the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reeds , the story came to an end . And the Jebusites on top of the wall cheered loudly , while the Israelites in the throng below lamented the death of their patriarch . And one of these standing nearby and observing the two women turned to Naomi and said : " Are you a woman in Israel " And she said : " That I am . " And he said : " Then why do you go about with this strange woman ? " And Naomi said : " She is no longer a strange woman ; she has become one of us . " And the man said : " Then why does she wear those amulets of Ashtar ? "  | And Ruth answered him saying : " It is because of my husband who used to wish me to wear these charms to please him though he was an Israelite living in Moab . " Then the man said contemptuously to Naomi : " That comes of our having to do with strangers ; they corrupt us to their ways . We can not change them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our story . " And Naomi said to Ruth : " Come , my daughter , let us be on our way . " But Ruth said : " Nay , let us remain , for I have never seen the like of these storytellers in Moab . Let us make our noonday meal here and watch their next play . " So they waited and ate while the players removed Jacob 's deathbed and set up wooden pillars and beams giving the semblance of a room in a house with two doorways , an outer and an inner one ; and they brought a rude couch and close by it they set up a weaver 's loom , its two posts sunk into the ground . And close by the loom they placed a huge pair of shears . " But why do not the players speak ? " asked Ruth . " It must be difficult for those who are not Israelites and have no knowledge of these tales to understand the unspoken ' story . Surely those Jebusites had no understanding of what had happened when they cheered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well , " said Naomi , " and they cheered out of their hatefulness toward Israel . And though these stories are being played out under the walls of the city of the Jebusites it is not for them they are meant but for the Israelites who take this road traveling between the tribes and to and from their tabernacle in Shiloh where they go to sacrifice to the Lord God of Israel . And for them the stories need not be spoken ; they are reminders  | of tales from our Book of Remembrance , tales that had been told them since childhood  --  reminders that they must not turn aside from their way into the gates and the ways of the Jebusites and the other peoples that revile the way of Israel . " And Ruth said : " I shall learn all the story of Israel , which is from henceforth my people . And now thou wilt tell me this one as it is played . " For the music had begun with a loud clash of cymbals and on to the stage strode five foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag of clinking silver . And one knocked at the outer doorway and they entered the house . Then to the strains of seductive music a woman appeared at the inner door . And she was beautiful and evil , and an avid smile lighted her painted eyes as she listened to the princes who displayed the silver in their bags while they whispered to her . And Ruth was curious about all this , but Naomi remained silent . " Tell me , Naomi , " begged Ruth , " tell me who she is and what they are telling her . " And Naomi said , though she seemed loath now to speak , " She is Delilah the Philistine woman and they are the Philistine princes who are offering her , each one , eleven hundred shekels of silver if she will seduce Samson the strong man of Israel and discover for them the secret of his strength . " Ruth said : " Then this is the story of that unwise hero whom thou didst mention to me one day on the way but of whom thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby them said : " He was indeed unwise to have had any traffic with the likes of her ; and if I had my way no strange woman would be permitted to enter the land of Israel . "  | And Naomi said to him : " Then it is well that you do not have your way . " And to Ruth she said : " Yes it is the story of Samson the Strong who once roamed these very hills . And now that we have eaten let us go on , and I shall tell you the tale some other time . " " But now , " said Ruth , " I do understand the play . See , Delilah agrees to do what they wish . And she hides the Philistine princes in the inner chamber ; for there comes Samson . Is he not wonderful ! " And he was indeed wonderful to behold . To loud victorious music came a monstrous man with bare brawny arms and massive thighs , clad in a tawny lion 's skin that barely served to cover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick black hair hung down from his head in seven long plaits . At his waist he wore for a weapon the white jawbone of a beast . And on his muscular back he bore two great iron gates . And Ruth asked : " Why is he clothed in that skin and armed with that bone , Naomi ; and why does he carry those gates ? " And Naomi said : " The skin is that of the lion he tore in two with his bare hands when it roared at him in the vineyard of Timnah . And the bone is the jawbone of an ass with which he smote thousands of Philistines at Lehi ; he rose up and laid them out in heaps upon heaps , after his own men had bound and delivered him to the Philistines who then ruled over Israel . And the gates on his back are the gates of Gaza wherein the Philistines thought they had trapped him one night while he lay there with a harlot  --  for Samson was a too lusty Israelite  --  but he arose at midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , bars and all , and carried them off . " " And now , " said Ruth , " she is enticing him in to tell  | her the secret of his strength . " For Delilah bared her breasts and took up a lyre and went to stand at the outer door of her house and , to the strains of her seductive music , she caught and held the eyes of that mighty Israelite , who , when he saw her beauty and the welcome in her eyes , cast off like toys the gates from his shoulders and followed her into the house and to her couch where Delilah soon lay in his lusty embrace . And she stroked the sinews of his arms , admiring his power and entreating him to tell her its secret until he whispered indulgently into her ear . " What is he telling her , Naomi ? Tell me what he is telling her , " pleaded Ruth . Then Naomi said : " Samson said to Delilah : If they bind me with seven green withes that were never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as another man . " And Ruth said : " Was it so , Naomi ? Was that truly the secret ? " Naomi said : " Wait and you shall see . " And Delilah pillowed the head of Samson on her soft breast and played him sweet music until he fell fast asleep . Then Delilah rose up and called the Philistine princes from the inner room and whispered to them what Samson had told her . And they hurried away and returned quickly with seven green withes and bound the sleeping man and went to hide again in the inner room while Delilah roused Samson to the sound of the cymbals striking a wild alarum . And Samson woke ; and as he stretched his powerful limbs the green withes broke like strings of tow touched by fire . And he laughed uproarously at Delilah 's test of his strength ; but she was sorely displeased with his mocking , so he took her again into his great arms , and again she entreated him to tell her the secret of his strength until again he whispered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he telling her this time , Naomi ? " And Naomi answered her : " Wait and you shall see . " And again Delilah pillowed the head of Samson upon her bare breast until he fell into deep sleep , and she arose and called the Philistines from the inner chamber and whispered to them what Samson had told her ; and they went out and returned with a length of new rope and they bound Samson fast with it as he slept . Then they returned to their hiding place and again Delilah woke Samson to the warning sound of the cymbals ; and he stretched out his arms and broke the thick new rope like thread , laughing aloud at her amazement . But this time she was so displeased at his deceit of her that he could not cajole her into his arms again . She turned away angrily from him and went to the loom nearby and began weaving a web , passing the shuttle swiftly back and forth and beating the strands together with the pin . Then Samson stood up and went behind Delilah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , but she heeded him not and continued her weaving until he whispered again into her ear . " What is he telling her now , Naomi ? " asked Ruth fearfully . " Surely he will not tell her the truth this time . " Naomi said : " Wait and see . " And Delilah , listening to Samson 's whispering , smiled again and went with him to the couch and fondled him there until he fell into deep sleep again . Then she rose up and went to his head and unbraided , one by one , the seven thick plaits of his long black hair and spread it out to the loom and drew the hairs in with the warp and wove them into her web , beating the shuttling weft with the pin to hold them tightly . And in their hiding place the watching Philistines drew their swords as Delilah , to the loud crashing of the cymbals , roused Samson again . And he  | raised up his head and turned it , and the loom came away from its place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beams , the pin and the woven web , all hanging from the head of Samson . And mighty Samson , laughing aloud , swung and rattled the loom about his head like a toy ; but Delilah wept and would not be consoled until Samson contritely called her to him and whispered again to her , this time very earnestly . And Ruth said anxiously to Naomi : " Now he is telling her the truth ; is he not , Naomi ? " Naomi said : " Yes , he is telling her the truth . For the power of a woman lies not in might but in patience and persistence . " And now Delilah , after sporting with Samson a while , bid him rest his head on her knees and she sang him to sleep ; and then she called the five Philistines to her and made them give her their bags of silver before she would tell them what Samson had said . " She is sure he has told her the truth this time , " said Ruth sadly . Naomi said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delilah motioned to one of the Philistines to bring her the huge pair of shears . And she cut Samson 's long black hair and it fell away from his head with the loom , and one of the Philistines shaved it all short with his sword . Then Delilah shook Samson while the cymbals clashed again , and Samson woke up with a start and seeing the Philistines close upon him he tried to rise up ; but his strength had gone from him and he could not , though he shook his head hard and flailed his great arms . And Naomi said bitterly : " The strong man 's weakness is in his head . " And seeing him helpless , four of the Philistines fell  | upon Samson and held him fast while one took his spear and put out both Samson 's eyes . And Samson howled in agony . And then to the sound of sad music the blind and broken man was led away , and the Jebusites sitting on top of the city wall howled with great glee and jeered down at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd below shouted down to her : " You there with the golden amulets ? what are you doing among the accursed Israelites ? Come in to us , my pigeon . You are too pretty for them ! " Ruth gave no heed to the Jebusite , but the Israelite standing beside her said : " Go in to the Jebusites ; you will be more at home with them than with us . " And Ruth said to him : " I have heard that Moses instructed the children of Israel , when they were yet wanderers in the desert , to deal justly with the stranger who comes to sojourn among them . Is it possible that thou hast not heard of his teaching ? " And when the man , abashed , had moved away from beside her she returned to watching the players , who came and removed the couch and the broken loom and set up the pillars and beams otherwise , in the semblance of a single large room . And a crowd of the players came dancing among the pillars to merry music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there looking down on the merrymakers . Naomi said : " It is the Philistines in the temple of Dagon at Gaza rejoicing that their god has delivered their powerful enemy Samson into their hands . " And Ruth said : " See , there are the five Philistine princes and deceitful Delilah is with them . " Presently Samson was led into the temple like a huge captive beast , chained hand and foot , naked but for a loin cloth ; and a new growth of hair hung ragged about his  | head and before his sightless eyes . And the Philistines stood him between two of the pillars , to which they fixed his chains , and they bid him dance to the music for their entertainment . And Samson did as he was bid , lumbering about like a blind dancing bear with his heavy chains . And the Philistines perched on the roof beams of the temple laughed loud at his antics , and so did the Jebusites perched on the wall of Jerusalem , until Samson , raising his blinded eyes in supplication to heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two pillars and pressed upon them , the one with his right hand and the other with his left . And he bowed himself with all his might which had returned to him with his hair , and the pillars parted and toppled and the roof beams of the temple with all the people perched upon them fell down upon Samson and the crowd of Philistines , upon the princes and the people about him , Delilah among them , and killed them all . And mighty Samson lay among the many dead he had made , as the play came to an end with mournful music , which was almost drowned out by the Jebusites up on the city wall who shouted down in anger at the Israelites , jeering at them and cursing . Then Ruth , her dark eyes filled with tears , turned to Naomi and said : " Why do the Israelites tell this unhappy tale of their unwise hero before hateful strangers ? " And Naomi answered her : " Because they fear the hatred of those strangers less than the seduction of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men of Israel go , as warning to them of the wiles of a strange woman , as a reminder to make them look with distrust upon all strange women . Though nothing is said of the foolishness of a hero who will let himself be so deceived and betrayed not by one woman but by two . " And she  | told Ruth how Samson had also been intrigued by the Philistine woman of Timnah into telling the answer to his riddle of the lion and the honey : Out of the strong comes forth sweetness . And Naomi said : " I have been loath to tell you the tale of Samson because you , too , are a strange woman in Israel ; but it is just as well that you know it now ; for you , my daughter , will have to contend with that distrust . But perhaps , with my help , " and then her old eyes twinkled shrewdly , " it can be overcome . Perhaps we shall give them a happier story of a strange woman ; and perhaps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of Ruth . " But Ruth 's dark eyes looked doubtful . For , the play having ended , the throng on the road was dispersing and the Israelites as they passed Ruth cast curious glances upon her , glances in which she saw that distrust and that fear of the strange woman which the story had stirred up in them . Then Naomi , observing that many of the Israelites were carrying lambs as if for sacrifice , stopped one of them and inquired what was the occasion . And the man looked at her in amazement saying scornfully : " Is it possible that you are a woman in Israel and do not know that this is the week of the Passover ! And tonight is the feast . These are the paschal lambs ! Perhaps you have been consorting too much with strangers to remember such things ! " And casting a contemptuous look upon Ruth he rode away . And Naomi said to Ruth : " In Moab we could not observe this festival which celebrates the flight from Egypt of Moses and the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in this month . But let us hasten now to Bethlehem and perhaps we shall arrive there in  | time for the Passover feast . We shall go to the house of Elimelech 's rich kinsman Tobias  --  who made the finest feast in Bethlehem every year . We could well do with a feast , after all that we have come through . " So they turned southward and urged their donkeys , the dove-gray and the milk-white one , along the road to the city of Bethlehem .  | AT SUNSET that evening when lamps were lit in the houses of Bethlehem the celebration of the Passover began . And nowhere was the festival better observed than in the house of Tobias , the richest merchant in the city . His house was the largest in Bethlehem , built of burnt brick with a high roof of cedar from Lebanon and set in a walled garden . Upon its massive doorposts were carved the ten commandments of the Lord God of Israel , in accordance with the words of Moses who said : And thou shalt write them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house of Tobias was much fine furniture , delicately carved and gilded tables and chairs and couches , some bought by Tobias in Egypt and some made for Tobias by his own artisans ; and there were rich rugs and dyed stuffs and wrought silver brought by his caravans from Damascus and by his ships from Tyre . Tobias himself was a paunchy and somewhat pompous man with beady brown eyes and a graying beard . And though Tobias , when he went to trade in Egypt , used to square the corners of his beard in the manner of the Egyptians , despite the injunction of Moses , he was always mindful of the favor the Lord God of Israel had shown him . And he had seen to it that his house was prepared for the Passover even more scrupulously than the Lord  | had ordained it . Tobias was a widower ; but there were many women in his household , his daughters and daughters-in-law and his maidservants ; and he had made certain that they had cleansed the house of every vestige of leavened bread , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , covered it with snow-white damask and set upon it two tall seven-branched candelabra of bronze , and platters of unleavened bread , and jars of wine and chased-silver wine cups and a great salver of silver bearing the roasted shank bone of the paschal lamb and roasted eggs and bitter herb roots and fresh green herbs and a thick sweet sauce of chopped fruits and nuts in a silver dish and a silver bowl of salted water . And when the women had lit the lamps of the candelabra Tobias took his place , reclining on a cushioned couch at the head of the great gleaming table , and he called all the family and friends he had gathered for the feast to take their places , each with a soft silken pillow to lean upon . There were Tobias ' sons and daughters and his sons-inlaw and his daughters-in-law and his grandchildren ; and there were several of his near kinsmen and among these was Boaz , a wealthy farmer whom Tobias would have liked to see married to his youngest and only remaining unmarried daughter Reba . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than one battle with Israel 's enemies . And for his heroic leadership Boaz had been made a judge in Judah  --  and Tobias , whose far-flung business often brought him into litigation , could well do with a judge in his family . And Boaz had brought with him two of his young men , Elias , his able foreman and Gibbor the mightiest of his workers , a Benjamite who had come to sojourn in Judah.  | And these three sat at the foot of the table , Boaz and his two friends , Elias and Gibbor the Benjamite , who were quite unlike : for cool-eyed Elias who sat on the right hand of Boaz was a slender man , austere , abstemious , pallid and stern of mien , earnest , upright and self-restrained ; while red-haired and hairy-handed Gibbor who sat to the left of Boaz was a powerful ruddy-faced fellow , a lusty lover of fleshly things . And manly Boaz between them was unlike either of them , yet he partook of something of each . He was tall and well made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his prime , with thick black hair glinting red where it curled on his head and beard ; yet his grave gray eyes and tender mouth revealed the earnest , upright and self-restrained spirit within . And when they were seated and waiting for Tobias to begin the Passover rite Boaz turned to cool-eyed Elias and said : " You are required to drink at least five cups of wine with this feast " ; and to Gibbor who reached at once for his goblet with his hairy left hand  --  for like many of the Benjamites Gibbor was left-handed  --  Boaz said : " But not to get drunk . " Whereupon Gibbor chuckled and said : " That is not likely with the Gadfly around . " And he waved his wine cup at a man who sat near the head of the table on the right hand of Tobias : a lean and hungry-looking fellow with unkempt hair , his coarse garment tied about his waist with a length of rope . Long frayed fringes dangled from the corners of his garment , and two small clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare left arm each bearing the ten commandments of the Lord God of Israel , in strict accordance with the words of Moses , who had said : And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand , and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes . The  | man was Zvuv , well named the Gadfly , a prophet of the neighborhood who , having no gainful occupation , was usually famished , and now sat looking with longing at the fragrant food the women had prepared and were carrying in from the kitchen . But Zvuv , his restless Adam 's apple bobbing up and down in his long bony neck , had to wait . For one of the grandchildren , a bright-eyed boy named Joel , raised up his childish voice and , pointing to the things on the table , began asking questions of Tobias : " Why is this night so different from all other nights of the year ? On all other nights we eat either leavened or unleavened bread : why then on this night do we eat only unleavened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind we like : why then on this night must we eat the bitter herbs ? On all other nights we never dip herbs in water or in anything else : why then on this night shall we dip sweet green herbs in salted water and bitter herbs in sweet sauce , as Mother has instructed me . And on all other nights everyone sits up straight at the table : why then on this night do we all recline at our ease ? " The boy ceased speaking with a sigh of relief , for he had spent his breath . Then , while hungry Zvuv sat sniffing the waiting food in torment , Tobias asked Boaz to answer the childish questions : " For is not our kinsman Boaz a learned judge in Israel ? " said Tobias ingratiatingly . Then Boaz stood up in his place and spoke to young Joel and the other children saying : " It is said in our Book of Remembrance : And it came to pass on the day when the Lord spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am the Lord : speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak unto thee . And Moses said before the Lord , Behold , I am of uncircumcised  | lips , and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me ? " And the children listened to Boaz but hungry Zvuv halted him saying : " Do we not all know what is in the Book of Remembrance , and as for the children let them be taught by their parents as Moses commanded . " But Boaz rebuked him saying : " Did not Moses say : And thou shalt tell thy son in that day , saying , it is because of that which the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt . Now therefore let us show these children what happened . I shall be Moses and you shall be Pharaoh and Gibbor here shall be Aaron my brother . " And as Zvuv sat fuming with angry impatience and the children watched wide eyed , Boaz pleaded with hard-hearted Pharaoh to let his enslaved people go and he turned to Aaron saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it become a serpent . And Gibbor the Benjamite did so , using his brawny arm for the rod and making his muscles writhe to the delight of the children . Then Boaz told how when Pharaoh 's magicians did likewise with their rods , Aaron 's rod swallowed up all their rods . And how , Pharaoh 's heart still being stubborn , Moses brought on the ten plagues : first , turning the river Nile to blood so that the fish died therein and the river stank ; second , bringing a plague of frogs which swarmed into the houses and upon the beds and in the ovens and the kneading troughs of the Egyptians ; and third , changing the dust of the earth to lice which covered both man and beast ; and fourth , bringing the swarm of flies that corrupted the whole land of Egypt ; and fifth , the murrain upon the cattle in the field and upon the horses , the asses and the camels , killing the herds and the flocks of Egypt while those of the Israelites lived ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread all over the land bringing boils breaking forth upon man and beast so that even Pharaoh 's magicians could not stand before Moses because of their sores ; and seventh , the storm of hail smiting all that was in the field , both man and beast , and every herb of the field and every tree , except in the land of Goshen where the children of Israel were ; and eighth , the locusts eating every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left until there remained not any green thing through all the land of Egypt ; and ninth , the darkness over the land , for three days , a thick darkness which could be felt so that the Egyptians saw not one another for three days while all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings . And Boaz showed how Moses stood before Pharaoh each time Pharaoh called him , promising to let the children of Israel go ; and , pointing at sullen Zvuv , Boaz told how each time Pharaoh hardened his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenth and last , when the Lord came at midnight and destroyed the first-born in the house of every Egyptian from Pharaoh the king to the lowliest among them , and the Angel of Death passed over the houses of the children of Israel which they had marked with the blood of the paschal lambs as Moses instructed them . " And then , " said Boaz to the children , " only then did fearful Pharaoh let the children of Israel go free . And that is why this night which we call the Passover is different from all other nights . And it is said in our Book of Remembrance that the people took their dough before it was leavened , their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders . And the children of Israel , fleeing in haste from the wrath of Egypt 's cruel  | king Pharaoh , had no time to leaven and bake in their ovens the dough they had prepared for the journey but had to let it bake in the hot desert sun as they carried it on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat here tonight . " Then Tobias distributed pieces of the unleavened bread to all around the long table . And Zvuv ate ravenously , eyeing the fragrant food the women brought in while Boaz continued to answer the questions of Joel . And why did they eat especially the bitter herbs on this night ? To remind them of the bitterness of the lives of the children of Israel as slaves in Egypt , building vast pyramids and palaces , said Boaz ; and Tobias passed to each one at the table a bit of the bitter herb . And why did they dip the herbs twice that night ? The bitter herb they dipped in the sweet sauce , thick as mortar , to recall how the bitterness of the lives of their forefathers as slaves in Egypt was overcome by the sweetness of the hope of freedom even as they had mixed the mortar for their cruel masters ; and the sweet green herbs they dipped in salt water , Boaz told the children as Tobias passed them the aromatic sprigs , because this festival of freedom came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the life-giving waters of winter seasoned with the salt of the earth . So all at the table dipped and ate the two herbs , first the bitter and then the green , the one in the thick sweet sauce and the other in salt water . And finally , said Boaz , his grave gray eyes bright as those of the children who hung on his words , why did they all recline at table this night ? As a sign of the freedom and well-being vouchsafed to the children of Israel by their One God , the God of their fathers , of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob , who had come from this land and whose children had returned to it out of bondage.  | Then Tobias said a prayer of thanksgiving to the Lord God of Israel , the Almighty One who created the fruit of the vine , while the silver cups were filled to their brims with wine and everyone drank . And the women brought ewers of water and basins for the washing of hands . And Tobias motioned to his daughter Reba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure , for Boaz had an eye for beauty and Reba was a pretty sight in the rich raiment her father had given her for this feast . Then the women brought the good food to the table and served it for all to eat . And all at the table were joyous  --  all but Zvuv , the prophet , who , even as he wolfed the rich food set before him , complained bitterly that they , the children of Judah , had not gone this year up to the tabernacle at Shiloh to celebrate the Passover before the Lord God of Israel as Moses had instructed all the children of Israel to do saying : Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose : in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tabernacles . And when Tobias answered him that they dared not leave Bethlehem this Passover for fear of the marauding Moabites who had destroyed the village to the north near Debir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backsliding of the children of Israel that the marauders have come , as it has always been in the past . " And he murmured , between mouthfuls , of the wrongdoing of the children of Israel in these latter days , sparing not even his host as he spoke of the avarice of the rich , of their lack of true charity which the Lord God of Israel had said was no more than justice to the poor . Nevertheless Tobias good-naturedly handed him stuffed  | fish which had been caught that very day in the Great Sea at Joppa and brought alive in salt water on his swift camels to Bethlehem . " Do not think , " said Zvuv , gobbling the savory fish , " that I am deceived , " dropping his angry phrases between delicious bites , " by your generosity to me . As it is said : The rich man is wise in his own eyes ; But the poor man that hath understanding searcheth him through . You have me here at your table , Tobias , for the sake of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the generosity of the rich will not atone for their avarice , without which they could not be rich and would not be generous . " And Tobias , trying to keep Zvuv 's mouth filled , helped him to more of the fish and said indulgently , " Nevertheless as the old saying puts it : The poor man is not popular among his neighbors but the rich man hath many friends . And are you not being too hard on the rich ? For is not the proverb true : The rich and the poor together , the Lord is the maker of us all ? " And Zvuv still eating industriously answered him : " Put not your trust in proverbs , while with your wealth you try to influence and corrupt the judges in the city gates . " And Zvuv turned then to Boaz at the foot of the table , complaining loudly of the lack of judgment and honesty of two of the three judges who held court at the city gates , warning Boaz  --  whom grudgingly he excepted from his charge  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of a trial he had coming up soon with his workmen . And Boaz laughingly assured Zvuv that nothing could influence his judgment ; that his judgment could no  | more be swayed by the hospitality of his kinsman Tobias than were the opinions of Zvuv himself . But Zvuv undeterred returned to berating Tobias . " And see how with your wealth you enhance the vanity of your women who think only of fine raiment and adornment . Look at them ! " And he ceased eating the roast lamb , which had been handed him , only long enough to wave his fork contemptuously at the women , all plump and sparkling with jewels , who gave not the slightest heed to him as they talked noisily amongst themselves while they happily fed their men , their children , and themselves the plentiful food they had made . Alas , no one in Bethlehem gave any more heed to the complaints of Zvuv than to the buzz of a gadfly . Nevertheless he persisted between strangling swallows of meat , saying : " Nor do the rich women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go gleaning in the fields and there become the wanton prey of the sinful men of the soil , " and Zvuv raised up his voice so that his words could be heard by the three farmers at the foot of the table , by handsome Boaz and cool-eyed Elias who as they ate heartily talked of the barley harvesting to begin on the morrow , and by hairy-handed Gibbor who raised his eyes from his meat only to drink more wine and look lustfully upon the younger of the women , especially upon Reba , the youngest of the daughters of Tobias . And neither did these three men heed the talk of Zvuv ; and Gibbor , to drown him out , set the wine-cheered sons and sons-in-law of Tobias to singing to their women : As a lily among the thorns , So is my love among the daughters . To which the women responded :  | As the apple tree among the trees of the wood , So is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry man of God lifted his voice yet louder to speak of the whoredom of the men of Israel , saying : " You go up into Jerusalem that is Jebus and there join the Jebusites in their abominations and then bring their ways into the cities and the fields of Israel . " And when he began telling how the farmers of Dan , in the north , hoping to increase their crops thereby , had set up a high place to Baal and Ashtar and held an abominable orgy in a grove , Tobias hastily instructed his daughter Reba to take the eagerly listening children from the table and feed them in another room . Yet Zvuv , undeterred , and still gobbling his meat with gusto pressed on , turning his tirade now upon Boaz alone , blaming him for his failure to restrain the men in his fields , saying : " I have myself seen them shamelessly lying there with the women . More than once have I seen there this son of Benjamin going after the women , " and he pointed to Gibbor who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to Elias and he listened to Zvuv . And when Zvuv ceased his speaking long enough to stuff more meat into his mouth , Boaz raised up his voice and spoke , but not in anger ; and all at the table , the men and the women , stopped their singing and gave heed to manly Boaz , who said : " I am a lover of freedom , Zvuv . And are we not all of us , children of Israel , lovers of liberty ? And did not Moses , our great prophet and leader say : Proclaim liberty throughout the land , to all the inhabitants thereof . And do we not on this very night ? as I have told the small children  --  do we not celebrate our  | freedom ? And is it not true that since our fathers took flight with Moses from their bondage to mighty Pharoah in Egypt we have had no one man to command us ? There is no king in Israel and every man does what is right in his own eyes . We have only judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Israel which Moses brought down to us . And for my part I see to it that there is no Baal worship on my land and that no woman is forced in my fields to do other than she wishes . Even Moses who knew well that men can be enslaved and destroyed by their desires gave us no law that a man and a woman may not lie together in a field if they so desire and do not thereby commit adultery . We are free men in Israel . " " And the women , too , are free , " said Gibbor merry with wine and looking boldly at Reba , who had returned from feeding the children . And Zvuv said angrily : " The Lord God of Israel is our king and he has given us his commandments , and the Lord our King does not look with indulgence upon the backsliding spirit of man . " " But , " said Boaz reasonably , " it is not yet entirely clear to us what is the will of the Lord God of Israel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago when the whole Earth was of one language and of one speech and the people came together to build a tower to reach up to heaven then the Lord said , Now nothing will be withholden from them , and he confounded their language and scattered them abroad upon the face of the earth , as if jealously guarding his secrets from man who had reached up to him . Yet at his bidding did Moses go up onto Mount Sinai and spoke to him and brought down to us the knowledge of the Lord and bid us seek to know him and all his laws and to observe them . And again though we are told  | that Zipporah the first wife of Moses was a woman of Midian , and that when he was leading our fathers into this land the Lord warned him saying , Lest thou take of their daughters unto thy sons and their daughters go awhoring after their gods and make thy sons go awhoring after their gods , yet did Moses himself thereafter take a Cushite woman for his wife and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Moses and Miriam his sister regarding that marriage , but he still favored Moses . And now too often do I find it difficult to know and to do what is right and to feel justified in judging another and telling him what to do and what not . I have heard it said by the wise that the spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord searching all the inward parts , and it seems to me that it is for each man to heed the commandments of the Lord as best he can , which is according to his own lights ? according to the lamp of his spirit . " Zvuv , who had stopped eating to listen , his Adam 's apple rising and falling impatiently , cried angrily : " Then tell me why have you not heeded the commandment : Be fruitful and multiply ! ? why is a man like you , young and strong and owning his fine fertile fields , why is he not yet married and the father of children in Israel  --  neither he nor his two young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eagerly awaited his answer . And Tobias , too , stopped stroking his well-filled paunch and leaned forward to listen . Then Boaz laughed gently before he answered , saying : " Though the Lord God of Israel has indeed counseled us to be fruitful , yet has he left a man free to choose when and with whom he shall marry and beget children for his inheritance . Jacob , the father of all Israel , did not marry until he found Rachel the woman he truly loved and he  | worked seven years and then yet another seven to get her . As for Gibbor and Elias " And here Gibbor , who was drunk with wine , rose up and shouted : " You know very well that there are not enough women in Benjamin and that the other tribes of Israel have sworn not to give their daughters to us . Would Tobias give me his daughter , Reba ? Would you Tobias ? " And Tobias shook his head . " No . Then can you blame me if I take what I can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that followed , cool-eyed Elias , who had drunk very little wine and was not given to gazing upon women , leaned over to Boaz and said : " Ask Zvuv now why he is not with his wife this Passover night . Can it be that he has heard the proverb : It is better to dwell in the desert than with a fretful and contentious woman ? And ask him who provides for the children he has made and now neglects while he is so busy correcting the errors of others . " Zvuv answered with angry pride : " It is the business of the prophet who serves the Lord God of Israel to put the correction of his people before every other duty . Moses left his wife , Zipporah , and his two sons , Gershon and Eliezer , with Jethro his father-in-law in Midian while he went to lead the children of Israel up out of Egypt . And in times to come , the children of Israel will be known as the people of the prophets . Did not Moses say : Would God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God forbid ! " exclaimed Gibbor . " And in times to come the children of Israel will be descended from us , backsliders though we be , who enjoy the making of many children , and not from you , prophets , who are too busy running about on your loveless errand . " And the men and women about the table laughed with Gibbor who sat down and reached for the wine again with his hairy left hand .  | And Zvuv , sputtering with fury , was hastily swallowing the food in his mouth to make way for more angry words with which to answer him when Tobias hastily said : " It is time now to open the house door , as is our custom on this night , in memory of that time when we were wanderers and as a sign of welcome to any passing stranger , hungry or in want of shelter , " and he poured a full goblet of wine to stand on the table as a symbol of that welcome . " Open the door now , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house door , a little fearful of this rite ? of what might be lurking outside . But there was nothing to be seen but the darkness of the night ; and she stood drawing her robe about her to guard against the chill night air while she waited for her father to finish the salutation : " ... whoever is hungry let him come in and eat ! " which he hastily mumbled without looking at the door , for no one was ever expected . And as Tobias ended , Zvuv drily remarked : " What poor man would venture to come unasked to the house of Tobias ? " But Reba , peering out into the starlit darkness cried : " Someone is coming ! Look ! There are twol Two women ! They are tying their donkeys by the garden gate  --  one gray and one white ! " And in a moment Naomi appeared in the doorway , saying : " Peace unto you ! " and behind her came Ruth . Tobias looked up from the table at the old woman in her worn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " and he asked : " Who are you ? " And the women of the household who went and peered at her as she entered the lighted room exclaimed : " But it looks like our Naomil " " Is this Naomi ? "  | " Can this be Naomi who went to Moab with Elimelech and her sons ? " " But it can not be ! " Yet , seeing that it was she , they embraced her . And Joel and the other children hearing their cries of welcome came running from the other room to see who had arrived . And Naomi sadly nodded her head and she said : " But call me not Naomi , the sweet one , for my spirit is no longer sweet as when you knew me . Call me Marah , which means bitterness , for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me . I went out full , and the Lord has brought me home empty . " " And where is my kinsman , Elimelech ? " asked Tobias , as the women hastened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He died in Moab , " said Naomi . " And our two sons also . " Then all turned to the dark doorway where stood Ruth , whose radiant beauty of face and form neither the shadows nor the sad state of her raiment could obscure . Beneath the gleaming golden amulets on her brow such as no woman in Israel wore , her dark eyes looked toward them , awaiting their welcome . And all their eyes were filled with curiosity . And Reba observed that the eyes of Boaz and his men were fixed upon her , Boaz sitting still in his place , but Gibbor standing up boldly , the better to see the strange woman . " This is Ruth , my daughter-in-law , " said Naomi . " A woman of Moab ! " exclaimed Zvuv , and he spat aside , as at something loathsome . " But she is no longer of Moab , " said Naomi firmly . " She is one of us . " " What do you mean ? How can she be one of us ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to persuade her from coming with me into Judah she said : Entreat me not to leave thee and to return from following after thee : For whither thou goest , I will go ; and where thou lodgest , I will lodge . Thy people shall be my people , and thy God my God . " But Zvuv looked dubiously at Ruth , who still stood by the door , and Naomi said : " Come , Ruth , sit here beside me , " and to the women she said : " We are weary and famished . " Then Ruth went to sit beside Naomi and the women brought food and placed it before them . And Reba brought the ewer of water for Naomi to wash her hands ; but Reba did not offer the water to Ruth , as if Ruth , not being an Israelite , would not want it . And Naomi seeing Reba turn away said : " Bring Ruth the water . She will not eat without washing her hands as we do . " But Reba made as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water had not Boaz got up from his place and taken the ewer from Reba and brought it to Ruth who , without lifting her dark eyes to him , said : " I thank thee , " and washed her hands with the water . Then Boaz returned to his place at the end of the table and sat staring at Ruth , his eyes filled with the faintly fearful fascination which her strange beauty stirred up in his heart  --  that strange beauty which was at once a promise of unknown delights and of unknown dangers . Tobias was greatly displeased with Reba for what had happened ; and he observed how the eyes of his unmarried nephew Namaan and even of the married men at the table had been drawn to the stranger . Displeasure and jealousy troubled the breast of Tobias as he considered the strange woman who had come into his house .  | And Ruth could not eat for embarrassment , because of the looks of suspicion which the women cast upon her as they served her and because of the look of scorn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . But Naomi , eating heartily , told of their journey from Moab and how Ruth had routed the wild beasts with a sling and had saved her alive at the ford of Jordan . And even young Joel was entranced at the sight of Ruth and he stood staring at her , exclaiming to the other children : " Think of thata woman who routed the wild beasts ! " And burly Gibbor the Benjamite , bent upon winning the favor of this strange and beautiful woman , came from his place beside Boaz to sit beside Ruth and brought to her in his big hairy hands the good things on the table beyond her reach . And he spoke softly to her , with ardent glances : " I have heard much of the Moabite maidens ; but never before have I been near to one and known how beautiful they might be , and I 'll be a son of Belial if I have ever seen a more beautiful maiden anywhere , even in Shiloh in the hill country of Ephraim where the maidens of Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say so ; but I am no longer a Moabitess , " Ruth answered him , " nor am I any longer a maiden . " And Joel whispered to the other children : " See how strangely they speak in Moab , saying thou instead of you , much as Moses and the children of Israel used to speak in the old days ! " But the ardor of Gibbor the Benjamite was not easily rebuffed ; and he took pleasure in the forthrightness of Ruth 's rejoinder . " So much the better for me , " Gibbor said , and he laughed aloud . From the far end of the table the grave gray eyes of Boaz watched them with awakening jealousy . And the cool  | eyes of Elias were troubled by the disturbance he saw in the manly face of his friend . And the eyes of Zvuv , seeing what was astir in the hearts of the men because of the advent of this strange woman among them , burned still more scornfully as he turned to Tobias and said : " The sons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our enemies by a strange woman . Samson was also called ha-Gibbor , the Strong . " Then Gibbor stood up from beside Ruth . And Naomi cried : " Hold your tongue , Zvuv ! Did not the Lord say to Moses : When a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the Passover to the Lord , he shall be as one that is born in the land . " Zvuv said : " Moses meant that the stranger shall be circumcised first as we are . Moses said : When a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the Passover for thy Lord , let all his males be circumcised , and then let him come near and keep it . " And Naomi said : " Then I thank God that Ruth is a woman and can not be circumcised in the flesh ; but she is circumcised in her heart and spirit , and Moses , who married Zipporah the daughter of a Midianite priest , would surely have counted her one of us . " Zvuv said disdainfully : " My wife also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whereupon Gibbor leaned across the table , threatening Zvuv with his great red-haired fist , and said : " Never mind about Moses ! You hold that bitter tongue in your head , or I 'll show you how strong I am ! I 'll be a son of Belial if I do n't ! " Zvuv shouted : " You are a son of Benjamin , of whom his father Jacob said when he blessed his sons :  | Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth ; In the morning he shall devour the prey , And at even he shall divide the spoil . " And Gibbor would have struck Zvuv had not Boaz come from his place and restrained him . Whereupon cool-eyed Elias stood up and said : " Come , Boaz , we must gather the omer tonight  --  the first fruits of the barley harvest for the sacrifice . " And Boaz , looking angrily at Zvuv , left the table with Elias , and they both took hold of Gibbor by the arms and led him away with them . Then Naomi asked Tobias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a thin young stripling when I left Judah ? " " That is he , " said Tobias . " He has grown to a valiant fellow , " said Naomi , looking after tall Boaz as the three men went out of the house . " He has indeed , " said Tobias . " He has been a strong defender of Judah against our enemies the Philistines who have troubled us often in the years since Samson brought the temple of Dagon down on the heads of their princes . And Boaz will lead us against the Moabites should they come again to molest us . " And he paused with a glance at Ruth , but she sat silent with downcast eyes . " Now Boaz is a judge in Judah ; the wisest of the three judges , and the most popular with the people . And he is the owner of broad rich fields ; of many cattle and even horses , which are still very few in Israel . Boaz is a much-sought-after young man by the women of Bethlehem . " Tobias spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much sought after , too , by the fathers of marriageable daughters . I should not mind having him for a son-in-law myself . " And he looked reprovingly at Reba , his daughter .  | Naomi said : " He reminds me of my Elimelech as he was when I married him . And did you not think him handsome ? ' " she asked Ruth . " I did not look upon him , " Ruth said , and indeed her eyes were too full of tears to have seen Boaz had she looked . And she said : " I dearly wish to remain in Judah with you , Naomi ; but I can not stay here in a house where I am scorned . Is there no other place for us ? " Naomi said : " My home , the old house of Elimelech , so long neglected , is doubtless no more than a ruin . " And she turned to Tobias : " Now tell me truly , Tobias , how you do feel in your heart about having us here in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Zvuv , who was busily gathering leftovers from the table into his ragged kerchief , and Tobias said : " You , dear Naomi , the wife of my kinsman Elimelech , are surely most welcome . And what you tell of the loyalty and the fortitude of your daughter-in-law is indeed remarkable , though I must say , for my own part , that I look for other virtues in a woman . All the same , and no matter what you say of her , she is a Moabitess and I can not prevent what will be thought and said of her here in Judah . Only yesterday came word of the band of marauders from Moab who burnt down a defenceless village to the north near Debir . And it is to be expected that there will be even more than the usual suspicion of anyone from Moab , not only in the town but in my own household . " And it was indeed plain enough in the faces of Reba and the rest of his womenfolk how they looked upon that strange beauty which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's behalf . " Now mind you , I am not intolerant , " Tobias continued , " for did not Moses command us to consider the  | stranger among us ; but he did so without considering the position we would be in , here in the land . Now there are bound to be troublesome difficulties and I do like peace in my household . " Then Tobias turned to Ruth , saying as he stroked his paunch gently : " To be sure , if you wish to stay here ? " Ruth said softly : " I can not stay here . " And Naomi rose up and said : " Indeed not ! Nor can I ! I would rather remain with you , Ruth , in a hovel , than in the rich house of a mealymouthed hypocrite who has engraved the law of the Lord on his gates but not in his heart . Surely we shall survive without his help . Come , my daughter , let us go now and see what remains of the house of Elimelech ! " They rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the dark narrow streets of Bethlehem , quiet and empty in the festival night , past the windows of houses all cheerfully lighted for the Passover . And they crossed the market place , lying deserted now between the two city gates with their tall , massive towers , one round and one square , where sentinels stood watch on the heaps of round stones piled up for missiles in case of attack and for the execution of judgment upon evildoers condemned to stoning . And they rode out through the right hand gate , the square stone Gate of the judges before which stood the bench of the judges ; and , after following a stony path that ran close outside the city wall , the two women came to the lightless ruin of a house on a hill . The late-rising moon sent beams through its broken walls ; the stars shone  | down through holes in its sagging roof . A jackal howled , leaped out through a window and trotted away as they approached . When Naomi unlocked and opened the door a flock of bats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from its hinges could not be closed again . Then Ruth had to plead with frightened Naomi to enter after her . And in the moonlit darkness it was Ruth who made the bed on which the two weary women lay down . And she stayed awake , though her heart and her eyelids were heavy with sadness , talking bravely of what they would do on the morrow , until the old woman ceased her trembling . Then as they lay there in the darkness they heard the distant voices of men calling to each other , and Ruth asked , " What is that ? " And Naomi said : " They are gathering the omer , the first fruits of the harvest , which are set aside for an offering to the Lord God of Israel . For the men of Israel though they no longer sacrifice their first-born sons yet give up to their God the first fruits of their fields . " Then Ruth rose up from her bed and went to the broken door and looked out ; and she saw in the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging sickles and scythes ; and some were calling , and others answered the callers ' questions , their strong voices rising up in the night to the moonlit heavens : " Is the sun set ? " " Yea ! " " Is this a sickle ? " " Yea I " " Is this a basket ? " " Yea ! " " Shall we reap ! " " Reap ! "  | " Let us reap for the Lord ! " And once again from a further field : " Is the sun set ? " " Yea ! " Over and over they called and answered as they gathered . And there was a comfort in the manly strength of their peaceful voices . And Ruth lay down again beside Naomi who had fallen asleep ; and she lay listening a long time to those strange reapers . She lay looking out through the open door at the strange moonlit land , its hills so different from the wide wild plains of Moab , her dark eyes filled with wonder before her destiny ... until she , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn . The day was bright and they set to work with a will , cleansing the long-neglected house and making such repairs as they could . They took two water jars and brought water up from the well at the foot of the hill . They washed the dust-covered pottery and utensils in the kitchen ; they heated the oven for baking , ground grain in Naomi 's stone quern , and baked their own unleavened bread . Naomi found her old loom and instructed Ruth in its use ; and Ruth said she would weave woolen curtains for the door and the windows through which the chill night wind had blown in upon them unhindered . And as they worked Naomi sang for Ruth that old Israelite song she had promised to teach her : A woman of valor who can find ? Her worth is far above rubies . The heart of her husband trusteth in her , And he shall lack for nothing . She doeth him good and not evil All the days of her life . She seeketh out wool and flax  | And worketh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships Bringing food from afar .... And hearing their singing , the neighboring women on their way down to the well stopped to greet Naomi , and they spread the news of her coming at the well so that many others came up to welcome Naomi back to Bethlehem , and they brought her gifts of food ; but all stared with suspicion upon the strange woman  --  the Moabitess whom Naomi had brought in among them , to become one of them . And on that first day and in the days that followed , when Ruth took a tall jar and , carrying it gracefully upon her head in the manner of the women of Moab , went down to the well for water , she was looked upon curiously by the women gathered and gossiping there and by the children playing there with the fountain of water ; but none spoke to her . And when she spoke to them none answered her , and some even mocked amongst themselves at her strange way of speaking . One day Reba the daughter of Tobias was there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Can it be that there are no men remaining in Moab , that their women must come with their golden charms to capture the men of Israel ? ... " until Ruth silenced her with a glance from her dark eyes that boded no good for Reba if she continued . Then Ruth spoke forthrightly : " Rest assured that I have no designs on the men of Israel , having left the husband I loved in a grave in Moab . It is for his memory alone , because they once pleased him , that I wear these charms . Surely you who live here under the wing of the Almighty God of Israel need have no fear of Ashtar , a goddess of Moab . And I came into the land of Israel because Mahlon weaned me away from the ways of Moab  | and taught me to love the ways of Israel , which he had kept in his heart . And you who are Israelites merely because you were born so have no cause to scorn one who has chosen to be an Israelite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chastened women at the well . But it was more difficult to deal with the children playing about the well , who had been told by young Joel of the evil things he heard spoken about the Moabitess in the house of his grandfather , Tobias . Led by Joel the children would follow after Ruth up the hill , whispering and pointing and mimicking her speech , until once she stopped and called them to her saying softly : " Come and speak to me , children , for I , too , am now one of the children of Israel , and I dearly wish I had children of my own like you , especially a lad like thee , Joel , whom I would teach to become a good Israelite , to learn the words of Moses and to obey the laws of the Lord God of Israel which tell thee to be good to the stranger among you. , , " And would you teach him , " asked Joel , " to sling stones as you did at the wild beasts on the way from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth , " and I will teach thee , too , if thou wishest . " And Joel watched with delight as she took some tufts of wool left by passing sheep on the nearby thorn bushes and twisted them into cords and braided the cords into a stout strand flat and wide in the middle from which she made him a sling . And she showed him how to loop the ends over a finger and how she could hit a tree with a smooth round stone , which Joel promptly did also , to his own great wonder and satisfaction and the awe of the other children . " Now let the Philistine giants come ! " Joel cried , letting another stone fly at the tree with a resounding crash . And picking up still another stone he said : " And this is how I  | shall fight any raiding Jebusites or Ammonites or Moabites ? " Whereupon he stopped and looked in confusion at Ruth . And she said : " To be sure , whoever they are , if they come not with peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with all thy might ! " But , alas , on this try Joel 's stone went wild and flew down to the well where it smashed the great jar of water which his aunt Reba had filled , and it deluged her dress . And then there was a great outcry from Reba and all the women with her at the well , calling the children away from the woman of Moab . Yet thereafter , the innocent eyes of the children , having looked into the dark eyes of Ruth and seen there the truth and the goodness of her love for them and her longing for their love , they trooped after her up the hill , no longer whispering and pointing , but holding to her skirts and laughing and talking to her as if she were their mother . And she made them strange little Moabite cakes , crescents of crushed barley ; and for the girls she shaped and baked and painted cunning clay dolls , and rattles of clay for the little ones . But their mothers , the neighboring women , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some Moabite magic in the figures she made , thinking they might be figures of evil Ashtar . And the heart of Naomi was saddened when she saw this ; she was sorely troubled for the plight of Ruth in the face of that ancient fear and hatred of all Moab in the heart of Israel . And she was angered at the women , her neighbors , who chided her for bringing a Moabitess in to live among them ; and because of her anger the women left off coming to Naomi and bringing her gifts of food . Then Naomi  | became sorely troubled about her own plight ; and one day when Ruth gave to the hungry children , who despite their mothers still came running after her , some cakes she had made out of their scanty store of grain Naomi admonished Ruth , saying : " Where are we now to get our own liveli-hood ? " But Ruth was undismayed . And she said : " Is not the sun shining bright on the land of Israel , and is not the Lord God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we prayed to him or made some sacrifice ? " They were sitting on the step before the broken door in the pleasant spring sunshine , grinding the last of their corn , Naomi feeding the grains into the quern while Ruth worked the heavy grindstone with her young arms . " Have I not taught you , " said Naomi impatiently , " that the Lord God of Israel , unlike the gods other men have made , is not to be moved by wishful prayers or even sacrifices , which he accepts as his due ; he is good and bountiful to those who know his laws and keep them faithfully . But unfortunately it is sometimes very difficult to know what his laws are . Especially for a woman , " she added bitterly . " And when a woman is married it would seem that she suffers alike for her husband 's transgressions . Though I did not want my Elimelech to leave Israel yet here am I still suffering for his wrongdoing . " And Naomi was certain that the Lord had forsaken them forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grinding , she stood and looked down from the neglected land of Elimelech upon the rich fertile farms in the valley below , where the morning breeze stirred the shimmering green and yellow fields of young corn and wheat and ripe barley . And there rose up to them the crowing of cocks from the barnyards , the lowing of cattle , the  | bark of dogs , the braying of donkeys , and the shouts of men reaping the barley harvest , swinging their sickles of flint and gathering the grain into sheaves . And Ruth observed how women went after the harvesters , gleaning the fallen grain and reaping the corners of the fields which the men left uncut . " Are those the bondwomen of the master of the field ? " she asked of Naomi . " No , " said Naomi . " It is a law among us , which Moses brought down from Mount Sinai , that the owner of the harvest may not take the gleanings thereof for himself . The law says : And when ye reap the harvest of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy field , neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest ; thou shalt leave them for the floor , and for the stranger . " Ruth said : " It is indeed a good and bountiful God whose ' law it is that men must provide for those among them who have not . " And Naomi said : " Indeed our law says further : When thou reapest thine harvest in thy field , and hast forgot a sheaf in the field , thou shalt not go again to fetch it : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow : that the Lord Thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands . And when thou beatest thine olive tree , thou shalt not go over the boughs again : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow . And when thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard , thou shalt not glean it after thee : it shall be for the stranger , the fatherless , and the widow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Ruth , " a stranger , fatherless , and a widow ? So shall I go gleaning and shall bring barley that we may eat and thrive here , Naomi . " " But it is not seemly , " said Naomi sharply , " for a woman of the family of Elimelech to go gleaning in the fields , else  | would I myself have gone down . And the men in the field may molest you . " Ruth said : " But didst thou not tell me that they think better of women than do the men of Moab ? " And Naomi said : " Perhaps I should have told you also that the difference between men lies less in what they do than in what they think . And besides , did you not hear what Tobias said ? The women of Bethlehem will speak ill of you . " " Let them speak , " said Ruth , her dark eyes flashing . " They can say no worse of me than they now think . " And Ruth said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after him in whose sight I shall find favor . " Naomi smiled then and said : " Sometimes it seems to me that you are not my daughter-in-law but the true daughter of my flesh and my spirit . " And she kissed Ruth and said : " Go , my daughter , " and gave her a large apron in which to gather the barley and pointed out to her the richest of the fields in the valley below . " Go there , my daughter , " she said . So Ruth got up on her milk-white donkey and rode down to the valley and went to that field which Naomi had shown her . And it happened to be one of the fields of Boaz ; for cool-eyed Elias , who watched over his men , was standing within the entrance to the field , wearing the ram 's horn at his belt with which he summoned the men . And Ruth got down from her donkey and went over to Elias and was relieved to see in his austere face that this was the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to him : " Let me glean , I pray thee , and gather after the reapers among thy sheaves . " But his look upon her was not friendly , and Elias said sternly : " You are the Moabitess , are you not ? "  | Ruth nodded her head , being too fearful to speak . And he said : " Our law requires of us that we do not forbid the stranger to glean . This is not a matter of kindness but of justice . I must let you in . But I counsel you not to divert the men in the field . And you had best take off those Moabite amulets ; and you had best veil your face . " So Ruth , seeing that otherwise he would not let her in , removed the golden amulets from her forehead and put them in the pocket of her dress ; and she veiled her face with the end of her black headcloth and entered quickly into the field and took her place with the women gleaning after the harvesters . And among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun she saw Gibbor the Benjamite , the mighty young man who had come to sit beside her at the Passover feast in the house of Tobias ; and his powerful chest was as hairy as his hands , a red fell covered his flesh . But Gibbor did not see Ruth , for he was hard at work at the head of the men , reaping faster than all the rest though he laughed and made light of the labor . He led them in the singing of songs as they worked : Rise up , my love , my fair one , And come away . The men sang together as they moved forward upon the standing grain , swinging their scythes : For , lo , the winter is past , The rain is over and gone ; The flowers appear on the earth ; The time of the singing of birds is come , And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land ; The fig tree ripeneth her green figs ,  | And the vines are in blossom They give forth their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth worked hard and steadily , bending in the hot sun to gather the fallen grain , and moving forward with the women after the men ; and though the heat and the unaccustomed labor wearied her , though her arms and back ached , and the sun burnt her hands and the stubble cut her feet , she was happy and content as she saw the good barley heaped in her apron , for she persevered and gathered as much as the other , more practiced women . They , for the most part , were older than Ruth , inured by time to the labor , burnt brown by the sun , and hardened by their unfortunate lot . Yet they spoke cheerfully to each other and chaffed the men whom they followed ; and they too broke into song : My beloved is white and ruddy , Towering above ten thousand His head is as the most fine gold , His locks are curled and black as the raven . And the men answered them singing : Thou hast ravished my heart , my sister , my bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thine eyes , And again the women sang : His eyes are like doves beside water brooks Washed with milk and most fitly set , His cheeks are as beds of spices , as banks of sweet herbs His lips are like lilies flowing with myrrh . And again the men answered :  | How fair is thy love , my sister , my bride How much better is thy love than wine , Thy lips , O my bride , are as honeycomb Honey and milk are under thy tongue . Then one of the women working near by to Ruth and seeing that she was ' a newcomer and had not joined in the song , called to her saying : " You are a stranger here , are you not ? " And Ruth saw that the woman lacked one hand , which had been hacked off at the wrist , though she gleaned very dexterously nonetheless . " I have just lately come up into Judah , " said Ruth . " But why do you veil your face ? " asked the woman . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is to keep my too tender skin from the sun . " Then the other laughed harshly and said : " When you have gleaned in the fields so long as I have you will cease caring for your skin , and no part of you will be tender . This is no place for the tender . You see this ? " And she raised up the stump of her arm . " My husband was fighting another man harvesting in his field and my poor husband was getting the worst of it so I went to his aid and took hold of his adversary by the secret parts , which is against our law . So they cut off my hand ; though my husband died of his wounds . Men put great store by their manhood . You 'd think it was something holy  --  the way they safeguard it , and they give the Lord God a tiny bit of it at birth  --  when they are circumcised . It is their most precious sacrifice . " And she laughed aloud . " Anyway I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And it happened that Gibbor had stopped nearby them to bind up a sheaf of grain and he heard the woman 's laughter and the last of her talk . And Gibbor called out  | to the woman and said : " Do you not know , my little flower , why it is that you are no longer tender ? It is because having no husband you lack for love , without which no woman remains tender . " And the woman answered him harshly : " I am no little flower ; but you are a hairy bumble bee lighting wherever you can . " And Gibbor said : " It is because the sons of Benjamin are the sons of Rachel whom Jacob loved dearly that we are great lovers . " The woman said : " You are all alike whether sons of a son of Rachel whom Jacob loved or of Leah whom he did not love yet gave to her many sons . You are all alike wanting forever to display your precious manhood . " And Gibbor answered her , singing : Thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Thou hast ravished my heart with one look of thine eyes .... And the woman answered him : " Sing rather of what you have ravished , 0 wolf of Benjamin ! " And Gibbor sang : How fair and pleasant art thou , 0 love , for delights ! And having finished binding the sheaf he approached the woman , still singing : Come , my beloved , let us go forth into the field . But the woman rose up from her gleaning and said : " I want none of your idle song of love when I am gathering good barley . Go back to your reaping , Gibbor . " And the other women working nearby laughed and pointed at him and cried : " Go back to your reaping , you left-handed son of Benjamin , you shall reap no women today . "  | And Gibbor was about to turn away from the onehanded woman when his eyes lighted upon the bent figure nearby her . And he saw that this woman was young and new to the field . So he came close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was darkly veiled . And it happened that Elias , the foreman , was going across the field and he saw Gibbor among the women , so he blew a blast on his ram 's horn and called to Gibbor to return to his work and Gibbor returned to his place at the head of the reapers . But he looked back again and again at the young figure of that silent veiled stranger until , seeing that she was gleaning alone between two of the sheaves and that Elias was gone to meet Boaz , who had come to the entrance to the field , Gibbor went over to her and stood before her and said : " Who are you ? " She looked up at him and said nothing ; but he saw above the black veil those dark eyes which had drawn him to her at the table of Tobias . And Gibbor put out his hairy left hand and lifted the veil from her face . " You are the Moabite woman who came with Naomi , " he said , his avid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springtime revelry in Moab , of how the women there go up to the high place and give themselves freely to the men . " Ruth stood up before him . " Surely , " said Gibbor , " you will not deny me a kiss or two . " And he put his two red-haired hands upon her . And Ruth let fall the grain she had gathered and retreated from before him until she came up against one of the sheaves ; but Gibbor pressed close upon her there , holding her to his hairy chest in his powerful arms while she struggled against him . And Gibbor was intent upon having his way with Ruth so that he did not perceive that Boaz had come into the field to look upon the work of his young men . Boaz was  | riding his roan stallion , Yohfe , and he greeted the men as he came , saying : " The Lord be with you ! " and they answered him , saying : " The Lord bless you ! " And Elias was walking beside his horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth with Gibbor and came upon them between the sheaves . And Boaz reached down from his horse and took Gibbor by the scruff of the neck and flung him away from Ruth , who turned and bowed her head and stood weeping against the sheaf so that Boaz could not see her face . And Boaz was very angry , saying : " You know well , Gibbor , that I will have no one forced in my fields . " And Gibbor was angry , too , saying : " There is no king in Israel , and every man does what is right in his own eyes . " And Boaz answered : " But none are slaves here ; neither women nor men . " And they might have come to blows had not cool-eyed Elias put a restraining hand upon the arm of Gibbor and said : " Go back to your labor , " and Gibbor turned away and went among the reapers . Then Elias took the head of Yohfe , the horse of Boaz , and drew him away , saying : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pasture to be seen . And Boaz went on with Elias a little way , leaving Ruth by the sheaf of grain ; but his eyes were drawn back to that forlorn figure as he listened to Elias , who asked : " Shall I send Gibbor away ? With women in the field he behaves like an ox . " Then Boaz smiling , said : " There is an old saying : Where there are no oxen the crib is clean ; but much is got from the vigor of the ox . " And still looking back at that strange woman bending now to gather up the grain she had  | dropped , Boaz said : " It is not for me who am not lacking in lust to chastise Gibbor , who is not pleasing in the eyes of women and lacks a wife because of the curse our fathers put upon the sons of Benjamin . " Elias said : " Regardless of what Moses said , if I had my way women would not be let into the fields to glean , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on complaining of the trouble women made between men when they came in among them . But Boaz was not listening to Elias . He reined in his horse , saying , " Wait , Yohfe ; wait , my beauty . " And he said to Elias , still looking backward : " Tell me , who is that young woman ? Do I not know her ? " And Elias was loath to tell him : " It is Ruth , the strange woman that came with Naomi out of the country of Moab . She came down to the field and asked me to let her glean and she has been gleaning diligently since morning . It is time for the midday meal . " And he raised the ram 's horn to his lips and sounded a loud cheerful call , summoning the reapers to their food . And Elias said : " Let us go and eat , Boaz . " But Boaz gave no heed . " Ruth , " he had heard , and was recalling how she had stood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horse and left Elias and rode after Ruth who was walking away with her burden of grain . He called after her and she stood waiting until Yohfe came and halted nearby her . And Boaz said gently : " Do not go away to glean in another field . Stay here among the women and I shall see to it that no man molests you . And when you are thirsty go to the jars they have filled , and fear not . " Ruth dropped her dark veil as he spoke and she turned her tear-stained face up to Boaz , searching to see what had moved him toward her , but her eyelids fell before the  | strength of his manly gaze . " Why have I found grace in thy sight , " she said softly , her words flowing slowly , " that thou shouldst take knowledge of me , seeing that I am a stranger ? " And Boaz said : " You did not observe me when you first arrived at the house of Tobias , my kinsman , but I observed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , and how you left the land of your birth and came to live among us  --  a people strange to you . " He looked upon her in silence , and then spoke again : " You are and he was about to put out his hand to touch her , but Boaz restrained himself and said : " You will be rewarded by the Lord God of Israel , under whose wing you have come to take refuge . " Then Ruth said , " Let me find grace in thy sight , Boaz , for thou hast comforted me , thou hast spoken kindly to me though I am not a woman of thy people . " And Elias sounded his horn again , summoning Boaz to the midday meal . But Boaz was loath now to leave Ruth . " Come , eat with us , " he said ; and he got down off his horse and led Yohfe after him , and Ruth went with him , followed by the envious eyes and knowing glances of the others , the less favored women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-matched pair , " said the one-handed woman . " A Moabitess ! " said another and spat on the ground beside her . " A woman for all that , " said the one-handed one . But Ruth was content to be going beside the tall and well-favored man whose bearing was at once gentle and strong , whose look was at once proud and kindly , whose speech was at once warm and wise . And then , looking up at Boaz and observing his grave gray eyes and the ravenblack hair glinting red where it curled on his brow and  | beard , it seemed to Ruth that indeed Naomi was right about the men of Israel , for never had Ruth seen his like in Moab . And as they walked together Boaz spoke of the goodness of God who had made the richness of his burgeoning fields . And when they came to the pasture where his flocks were grazing , he stopped to look upon the woolly sheep with their gamboling lambs and the long-haired goats with their skipping kids , and he recited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him this land : Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks , and look well to thy herds ; When the hay is mown , and the tender grass showeth itself , and the herbs of the mountains are gathered in ; The lambs will be for thy clothing , and the goats the price for a field ; And there will be goats ' milk enough for thy food , for the food of thy household , And maintenance for thy maidens ... . And Ruth saw that Naomi had spoken truly : There were men in Israel who were indeed unlike the men of Moab . And Ruth felt for the first time that she was safe and secure in this strange land as she went beside Boaz toward the place where his men were gathered about the plentiful food which he had provided for them . The men , Elias and Gibbor among them , were sitting in the shade of a wide-spreading terebinth , eating heartily of the heaps of goat 's cheese and olives , and dried corn which they dipped in sour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too restless to sit with their elders , came only to help themselves to handfuls of food and then went off to compete with each other in stone throwing , in jumping and climbing , shouting at their play as if repelling attackers . And those sitting under the tree spoke of the Moabite raiders who had come again across Jordan and burnt down another defenceless village to the north and laid waste its fields and taken its harvest of grain . This time the marauders had come farther into Judah , westward beyond Debir toward Enshemesh on the way to Jerusalem . The news of that raid had just come to Bethlehem . And the older men among the harvesters of Boaz told what they had heard their fathers tell of the old days when a good harvest in Judah would bring the marauding Midianites up from the south to plunder their crops and their cattle , coming into the land like locusts to destroy it , year after year , taking the grain that had been garnered and all the fat flocks , and leaving no sustenance , neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the frightened farmers fled before them to escape with their lives , leaving their homes to seek refuge in caves in the mountains or within the walled cities ; until Gideon , the doughty farmer of Manasseh , weary of working all year to set a table for his enemies , gathered an army and with the help of the Lord God of Israel routed them again and again until they ceased coming . During these last years of famine the land had not been molested . But now , seeing all about them the rich harvest in the fields of Boaz , the tall standing grain and the fat sheaves they had gathered , his men considered the chance that their enemies , hearing of their abundant crops , might be moved this year to return to rob them of it . " And not merely the Midianites , " said one brawny old fellow . " This time the Philistines may come from the west ;  | and those Moabites who came across Jordan may be spying out the land for others of their tribe who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join there with the Midianites to come up again upon us in great strength . " And cool-eyed Elias , eating sparsely of the food as was his wont , said : " Then let us be well prepared to protect ourselves . Let us have our arms always with us , by day and by night , each man his stout club , his sword or his spear , or his bow and arrow ; and let us keep our scythes well sharpened so that they too may serve to defend us if we are attacked here in the fields . And two likely lads like you , " he said to two youngsters who had come from their play to fill their mouths hastily , " should practice diligently , remembering that this is not just a game you are playing . " But the boys were not attentive to Elias ; and one of them , seeing Boaz approaching with Ruth from afar , said : " Here comes Boaz with the woman Naomi brought back with her from Moab . I have seen her drawing water at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And the other said : " She walks like a princess . And my mother says she is of the house of King Eglon whom Ehud the Benjamite took by surprise and slew in his summer house with a well-aimed stab in his big fat belly . Is that true , Gibbor ? You are a Benjamite ; you should know . And was not Ehud your great-grandfather , who went to Moab to kill King Eglon ? " Elias said hastily : " Do not start Gibbor telling that story now . We have heard it often enough . " But Gibbor only said : " It is possible that she is of the house of Eglon , " as he sullenly watched Ruth approaching with Boaz . And the lad said with a sigh : " It must be very pleasant  | to lie with a princess ; and I have heard it said that the women of Moab are taught every spring by their priests on the high place how to sport with the men . They must be well practiced . " And Gibbor said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in the market place up in Bethlehem are practiced enough for the likes of you lads . " Elias turned his cool eyes sternly upon Gibbor and the two lads and he said : " Have you forgotten or have you never heard how the men of Israel when they dwelt in Shittim committed whoredom with the daughters of Moab and the children of Israel were stricken with the plague so that twenty-four thousand died ? And the Lord God of Israel told Moses to command the children of Israel to slay every man who had joined himself to the abominations of Baal-Peor . And Phinehas , grandson of Aaron the High Priest , took a spear and went after Zimri the Simeonite who had taken Cozbi a Midianite woman into his tent , and thrust them both through with his spear , the man through his back and the woman through her belly . " And the two lads were very frightened as they listened to Elias who continued to speak : " For the woman Cozbi had been sent by the Midianites to beguile the men of Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is well to remember also how Delilah the Philistine woman served the Philistine princes in seeking out the weakness of Samson the strong man of Israel . For may not this woman of Moab have come here likewise to serve her people secretly ? " And the brawny old man spoke again : " Then let us send her away ; and let us keep all strangers out of our land . " But Elias shook his head and answered him : " It is forbidden  | us by the laws of Moses to deny sustenance to the stranger who comes to sojourn among us , and though it seems a dangerous law , still it is in our Book of Remembrance and we must keep it ; but that does not mean we must not be on guard against the stranger who may be a spy for one of our enemies . " Until then Gibbor the Benjamite maintained his sullen silence as he watched Ruth and Boaz coming across the field . But when they had come within earshot he turned to Elias and lifted up his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baal-Peor when he takes a strange woman ; nor need he be as weak in his head as was Samson . And it is quite possible that the men of Moab are not waiting for the harvest but are raiding us now because they are angered that one of their women left Moab to come and sojourn in Judah . " And as Ruth and Boaz came nearer Gibbor said , " And if I had my way , instead of going about armed and waiting for the men of Moab to come and attack us we would go first across Jordan and take them by surprise and destroy them and take all the women of Moab away for ourselves . And I am a son of Belial if I could not vanquish the Moabites with three hundred picked men of Judah as Gideon took thousands of the Midianites with his three hundred men of Manasseh , especially if we could get from Tobias the merchant some of the iron and brass he has found in his hills . We could make us stout spears and shields and perhaps even some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Belial if I would not take ten of the women of Moab for myself . " And Gibbor spoke loudly so that Boaz as he came near with Ruth could not but hear his boasting ; and Boaz looked sternly upon Gibbor as he greeted the men , saying : " The Lord be with you , " and they answered him saying ,  | " The Lord bless you . " Then said Boaz to Gibbor : " We are a people of peace . And the Lord God of Israel has commanded us not to covet what is our neighbor 's . " And Gibbor said : " It is all very well for you , Boaz , who can have any Israelite woman you wish , to speak of not coveting what is your neighbor 's ; but I am of the tribe of Benjamin who lack for women and whom no Israelite will give his daughter for wife . And as for our being a people of peace have we not killed many men in battle  --  thousands and tens of thousands ? " Boaz said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to remember the men I have slain in battle , nor the thousands Israel has destroyed of those who would have denied us our homeland or would have enslaved us or corrupted us with their abominations . " Then Gibbor was silent ; and Boaz bade Ruth be seated beside him and he handed her food and drink and helped her to wine into which she might dip the corn , as if she were an honored guest and not one of the lowly gleaners , so that it was clear to his men , who could not but be entranced by the ripe beauty and sweetness of this strange woman , that she had found favor in the eyes of Boaz . And this was observed with increasing resentment by hairy-handed Gibbor , who sat silently drinking much wine ; and with uneasiness and concern for the beguilement of his friend by cool-eyed Elias , who drank no wine at all . And Ruth , looking upon these men of Israel as she ate among them , saw that they were at once like the men of Moab in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which Naomi had spoken . Even Gibbor the Benjamite now sat silently staring at her . And her heart as well as her eyes told her that , among them all ,  | Boaz was the best . Like Naomi 's Elimelech , he was both vigorous and thoughtful ; and yet she saw no sign that Boaz was divided in spirit as Naomi had said such a man was bound to be . In his way with his men it was clear that he could be firm like a master and kind like a father ; and with her , the . woman , he was both gentle and manly ; and all these traits were but the parts of one thing , his goodness , it seemed to Ruth as she observed and listened to Boaz . And he was at one , thought Ruth , not only within himself but with his God and his men . Before he broke bread he blessed the Lord God of Israel for his bounty ; and while eating heartily he praised his men for the excellence of their labors which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said : " Now tell me , Boaz , why need you thank the Lord God of Israel for this bounty when you admit that it is we who by our labors have brought it forth from the earth ? And why is our God greater than any other god if we still have to labor for his bounty ? " And Boaz answered him softly but firmly saying : " Moses said : Man does not live by bread alone , but by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord does man live . And our God , " said Boaz , " is greater than any other god because he has revealed to us his laws in order that we may know good from evil and learn the way to a good and righteous life . " " And yet , " said Elias , " we are told that the Lord forbid Adam under pain of death to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil which grew in the garden of Eden . " Boaz said : " And man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ignorance of the beasts , innocent as a child . The choice was man 's ; and man , with  | the help of woman , " and he turned to Ruth and smiled upon her , " chose to partake of the knowledge of good and evil though he suffer and die for it ; and since then some among us , and we are all sons of Adam and Eve , have persisted in seeking that knowledge , in striving to know our God  --  that knowledge which , though it has brought us suffering and death , is yet our life , as Moses has said . " " And yet , " said Elias again , " we are told that after the flood when the sons of Noah and their generations who were of one language went to the land of Shinar and there built a high tower whose top might reach unto heaven , the Lord was fearful and jealous of them saying : Now nothing will be withholden from them which they purpose to do ; and he confounded their language so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered them abroad upon the face of the earth so that they left off building the tower to his heaven , which is called Babel to this day . " Ruth said : " That is indeed a strange story and perhaps it was told not as a thing which had truly happened but as a fable to account for the differences in the languages of men  --  such as the difference between the speech of the men of Egypt and of the men here in Canaan . " And Boaz , looking upon her and listening to her slow sweet speech ; nodded his head in agreement . But Elias said sharply : " There are no fables in our Book of Remembrance , and though it may seem strange to a stranger it is God 's truth to us . " And Gibbor said : " Indeed I once knew a camel driver who had been to the land of Shinar and he said he had seen all that was left of the tower and it was a monstrous heap of broken brick and stones lying every which way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Boaz , " and since  | then the Lord has manifested himself to our forefathers , Abraham , Isaac and Jacob , and revealed his laws to us , the children of Israel , and commanded us to learn his laws , through Moses his prophet who brought us to this promised land . " And Boaz looked with contentment upon the fertile fields about him , peaceful and soundless under the noonday sun but for the song of birds , the whirring of crickets , and the shouts of the two young lads who , having stared their fill at the Moabite woman , had resumed their rock throwing and their climbing . Then Ruth , who had finished eating and was satisfied , rose up to return to her gleaning . And Boaz looked into her dark eyes and said : " Do not fear to come and eat with us whenever you wish . " And Ruth knew then in her heart that she loved this man , Boaz . And when she had gone , Boaz said to his men : " I bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger among us . Let her glean after you in peace and put her not to shame . " Then said the brawny old man : " But have we not been warned against the Moabites ? Did not Moses say : An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord . And is not this woman of Moab ? " Boaz answered : " It is not clear if Moses meant the women of Moab as well as the men . And did not Moses also instruct our fathers , more than once , not to mistreat the stranger among us ? And this woman has said , when she left Moab with Naomi , that the Lord God of Israel would henceforth be her God . " And another man said : " But what if she told an untruth and is indeed come to spy out our land and our fine harvest for the men of Moab who have already made two raids upon us ? "  | Then Boaz said impatiently : " But you have only to look upon her And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Delilah  --  and to what end we all know . " Then Boaz smiled and said : " You , my friend , who remember Samson so well , do look with fear and without favor upon all women , whether strange or not . " Whereupon the men laughed heartily . Then Boaz continued : " Therefore I bid you , Elias , to look upon this woman with watchful suspicion lest she be a spy . " And then he looked into the sullen eyes of Gibbor saying : " As for the rest of you , I bid you not to look upon her at all ; but , remembering that three times we were commanded by Moses to leave our gleanings for the stranger sojourning among us , I bid you again to let her glean after you in peace . What is more , I bid you also as you reap to pull out some grain from your bundles and let it fall for her to glean , for she has old Naomi to provide for , and is not a practised gleaner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fields , Gibbor , addressing himself to another said loudly : " And is it not wonderful to be the owner of a field , for then you can be generous to others and , at the same time , to yourself  --  even with something which someone else has found on your land . It is too bad that old Moses did not give us a law saying who may glean the women ! " The face of Boaz darkened with anger and he raised his hand as if to strike Gibbor ; but Elias put out his hand and restrained him . Then Boaz said : " It is said : Every way of a man is right in his own eyes , but the Lord God weighs our hearts . We have no king in Israel and every man does what is right in his own eyes ; but we have the commandments of the Lord God of Israel which Moses brought down to us ; and  | here in my fields I shall strive with all my heart , with all my soul , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord said of them : This is your life . Sometimes , as in this instance , it is indeed difficult to know what to do as between two commandments . And when in obeying the commandment you are endangering your lives , when you are giving freedom to one who may be your enemy , it is doubly difficult . Yet we were surrounded by enemies then , even as now , when Moses on the way to this land so often enjoined us in the name of the Lord God of Israel to care for the stranger in our midst ; and surely valiant men should put justice to others before fear for themselves . Return now to your harvesting . " And Elias blew a blast on his ram 's horn . And when Gibbor and the rest had gone back to the fields Elias said again to Boaz : " Shall I send Gibbor away ? " Boaz was silent and thoughtful a while before he answered : " No . It is not the fault of Gibbor that the men of Israel have sworn not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gibbor is a lusty fellow . Nor can I sit in judgment upon Gibbor because , to tell the truth , it is not without desire that I too have looked upon the Moabitess . " And cool-eyed Elias said : " Then send her out of your field , Boaz . You know the proverb : The prudent man sees evil and keeps clear of it ; the thoughtless go ahead and pay the penalty . The Moabitess has already disturbed the peaceful friendliness of your life with your men . Send this strange woman away . " But Boaz laughed heartily saying : " Do not fear for me , my prudent friend . I am no callow youth , innocent in the ways of women . I am not being captivated . If I am kinder to this one it is only that she is my kin by marriage and  | a stranger in Israel  --  and are we , Israelites , not commanded to be good to the stranger in our midst , for we were strangers in " I know , I know , " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the children of Israel wandered in the desert went so far as to say : Thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian because thou wast a stranger in his land . And between us , I will say frankly that I have never seen the wisdom of that commandment for us , living here surrounded by enemies on all sides  --  Philistines to the west , Ammonites to the north , Edomites and Midianites to the south , and Moabites to the east . And even in our midst we have the hateful Jebusites within the thick walls of Jerusalem . And I have still a terrible childhood memory of those strangers  --  the spies who came and let into our city by night the cruel hordes that laid waste our land , destroyed our home , slew my father and mother , and violated my sisters before my childish eyes so that to this day I can not approach any woman with love . No , I have never understood why Moses said that because we were mistreated as strangers in Egypt we must not oppress the stranger amongst us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like this woman of Moab , bring down upon us the vengeful wrath of the men of her land . A stranger is dangerous , I say ; and a strange woman is doubly dangerous ! " And cool-eyed Elias was pale with anger . " I know , " said Boaz gently , " that reason is on your side . And I , who have fought the Philistines more than once though I am a lover of peace , know very well how dangerous our enemies are . Yet is it not clear that Moses brought us up out of Egypt so that we might not be as the corrupt and evil Egyptians but a people apart , serving the one God of justice , not with cruelty but with love and compassion . I do not mean , Elias , that we Israelites shall  | not be on our guard against treachery  --  and even against enchantment . " " Then , " said Elias , " if she should indeed prove to be a spy , intent upon betraying us to her hateful people or corrupting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you then have the Moabitess stoned at the Gate of the Judges ? " And Boaz said gravely : " I am a judge in Israel ; and we have one law for all  --  stranger and homeborn alike . A spy should be stoned . " And then Boaz smiled gently upon Elias : " You need have no fear , my friend . I shall not do myself what I have forbidden Gibbor the Benjamite . I shall restrain myself , as I have restrained him . I shall not go near the woman of Moab . " And when Elias had left him Boaz went to his handsome stallion and stroked its smooth coppery flanks , saying : " Count yourself lucky , Yohfe , my beauty , that you are a beast and not a man . When you see a likely young mare you are not plagued by doubts , are you ? " And Boaz mounted upon his horse and rode off . Having beaten out her gleanings of that day and got a good measure of barley  --  not unremarked by the other less-favored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the hill to Bethlehem toward evening ; and having tethered her milk-white donkey outside the broken door she went into the house and showed Naomi how well she had done in her gleaning . Naomi marveled that she could have gathered so much the first day and took some of the grain for their evening meal , asking where had she gleaned . And as Naomi prepared the food , Ruth sat down to  | weave at the loom and told how she had gone into the field Naomi had pointed out to her  --  and it happened to be the field of Boaz . And Naomi did not look surprised though she said : " Was it indeed , " and she asked Ruth why she was no longer wearing her golden amulets . And Ruth told her of her meeting with Elias at the entrance to the field of Boaz . Then Naomi asked Ruth how she had fared in the field of Boaz . And she got from Ruth the tale of how Boaz had saved her from Gibbor the Benjamite , and of the generosity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . And Naomi said : " Blessed be he of the Lord , who has not left off his kindness . Boaz , like Tobias , being kin to my Elimelech is kinsman to us  --  he is of the house of Nahshon , a prince of Judah  --  a valiant and worthy young man and well made , as you have doubtless observed this time . " Naomi looked up from her cooking to glance at Ruth , whose face was bowed over the loom . And Ruth said softly : " I have never seen his like in Moab  --  a man both gentle and vigorous , thoughtful yet strong in action . " Naomi said : " I knew his mother ; we were near neighbors . I remember when he was born and how pleased his mother was . " And Ruth said : " Was he her first-born son ? " And Naomi said : " No . Her first-born had died . Hence he was her eldest son , though not the first-born . And his mother asked me about a name for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is strength . " And Ruth said : " As he spoke to me I was minded of what thou didst tell me of the riddle of Samson and the lion : Out of the strong came forth sweetness . " Naomi looked shrewdly at Ruth , whose face was still  | bowed over the loom ; and it seemed to Naomi that the appearance of Ruth 's face had changed ; and she saw then that it was because Ruth had not put again on her brow the golden amulets of Ashtar . And Naomi was pleased , but said nothing about it and she waited for Ruth to speak . But Ruth said nothing more . Then Naomi said : " Boaz is wealthy , too . So that it is good that you go gleaning in his rich fields . But this I must tell you now , my daughter : though it is indeed true , as I said to you on the way here from Moab , that the men of Judah are better than the men of Moab in the way they consider their women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are as lustful as any Moabite and as prone to frolic in the fields with any maiden who will let them . " Ruth said : " There were among the women gleaning in the field some who do not think as well as you do of the way the men of Israel consider their women . There was one who had her hand cut off for what she had done in trying to help her husband in a fight ; and there was also the wife of Zvuv who complained bitterly of how he went about prophesying and left her to labor in the fields to find food for their children . Being the wife of a prophet must indeed be trying ; but it appears that the young Israelites when they are lustful like Gibbor behave no differently from any young Moabite . " Then Naomi hastened to say : " But you must not judge all the Israelites by Gibbor , who is a Benjamite and came here because women are lacking among his tribe , and the Benjamites have a bad reputation among the Israelites for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter to a Benjamite . But as lustful as the men of Israel may be , at least they do not say their God bids them be wanton with  | women , nor do they make of their lustfulness an open abomination before their God ; for the Lord God of Israel , though he commanded them to be fruitful and multiply , has also commanded them against the violation of virgins and the taking of other men 's wives . " And Naomi came from her cooking to help Ruth untangle the threads of her weaving which had gone astray . Then she continued , saying : " Now you , my child , are a widow and a stranger ; and men , as I have told you , are apt to forget their precepts in the face of their desires . A lusty man of Judah , even one less unrestrained by nature than Gibbor the Benjamite , may , on occasion , feel that these commandments do not apply to you . So , though I am pleased that you have found favor in the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his fields , it is not merely because you are safer there than elsewhere . For I do not look forward to your gleaning endlessly , even there , harvest after harvest and year after year , burnt by the sun and bent with toil until you are like those poor worn-out creatures who have to glean in the fields like that onehanded widow and the fretful wife of Zvuv . " Ruth looked up from the loom , her dark eyes dream filled , and she said : " And what is it thou seest for me in the future , Naomi ? " And Naomi , as she brought the steaming bowl to the table , said : " I see you married to a valiant young man , well made and wealthy . I know , you have said that you would not want a levirate marriage ; so I have done nothing about that , especially as Elimelech 's brothers are dead and have left no sons . But for any other marriage you will need a dowry , at least to clothe yourself fittingly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her household . And unfortunately , men being unreasonable  | creatures , the richer a man is the more dowry he usually requires with his wife , although you would think it should be the other way around . " Then Ruth rose from the loom and went to the broken door and looked out . She could see the green fertile fields of Boaz in the valley below , and eastward beyond the Salt Sea the long line of the high plains of Moab , and she said , " Dost thou think I have already forgotten Mahlon ? And even if I would take another man in his place , dost thou think that any man here would have me , a Moabitess , for his wife , even with a dowry ? And even if there were such a man , " she said , turning to look around her at their poor home , " where is this dowry of mine to come from ? " And Ruth returned to the open door . Then Naomi said : " Leave that to me . " And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naomi said : " Come now , my daughter , and eat . " And she took up her spinning whorl and her old eyes were smiling as she began spinning a strong new thread while Ruth ate of the food that she had prepared .  | IN THE MORNING , when Ruth had gone down to glean , Naomi went to the gates of Bethlehem , seeking her rich kinsman , Tobias . For all of Bethlehem passed by the city gates in the course of the day . There within the thick wall , in the open space between its two great gates , was the market place , where the merchants came to trade with each other , and the men and the matrons and maidens of Bethlehem came to purchase their needs and their wants in the booths of the artisans , the workers in leather , the potters , the silversmiths , and the sellers of food and raiment , of perfumes and jewels , of rugs and silks , of cotton from Egypt and of wool from the flocks in the fields beyond those two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant stream of laden camels and donkeys coming and going . And this was not merely the market place but the court of justice and of entertainment . For in the shade of the square stone tower of the right-hand gate sat one or more of the three judges of Bethlehem holding court for those who had grievances to adjust or agreements to transact . And in the vicinity of the round brick tower of the lefthand gate were the wineshops for the men and the sweetshops for the women and the striped tents and booths of  | the wandering tricksters and clowns , strange wizards and soothsayers , who strove to beguile and amuse the passersby with their antics , their music , and their wiles . And a constant noise rose up from the multitude of men and women walking and riding about that sunny dusty place , and from . the children at play darting with shrill cries among them . But above all the hubbub rose the harsh angry voice of Zvuv who stood in the midst of the ceaseless traffic , now here , now there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about seeking her kinsman Tobias in the crowd she heard the voice of Zvuv crying : " Woe to the children of Israel for their backsliding , for their forgetfulness of the commandments of the Lord God of Israel .... " But Tobias was nowhere to be seen ; and Naomi thought of going to find him at his house . But remembering the manner in which she had left him on the night of her arrival in Bethlehem , the old woman was too proud to return there . So she went on , inquiring after him among the merchants in the market , but no one had yet seen Tobias that day at the city gates . Still , Naomi knew she was bound to meet him there if she but waited long enough . And the sun being warm she went to wait in the cool shade of the square stone tower of the Gate of the Judges , where the eldest of the three judges of Bethlehem , a venerable old man , a hero of Jephthah 's war against the Ammonites , now half blind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' bench disposing quickly , one after another , of the less difficult cases which came to be dealt with early in the day . And he was attended by the scribe who sat nearby him with the great parchment scroll of the Book of Remembrance and a heap of inscribed tablets of dried clay , from among which , when instructed by the judge , he  | would draw the suitable one and read aloud the law of Moses for the matter in hand : If thou lend money to any of my people with thee that is poor , the scribe was reading , thou shalt not be to him as a creditor ; neither shall ye lay upon him usury . If thou at all take thy neighbor 's garment to pledge , thou shalt restore it to him by that the sun goeth down : for that is his only covering , it is his garment for his skin : wherein shall he sleep ? And it shall come to pass , when he crieth unto me , that I will hear ; for I am gracious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litigants , a fat , prosperous-looking man , who still held in his hand the cloak of the ragged little man who stood shivering in the shade beside him . " Give him his garment , " said the judge ; and he turned to the elders of the city who sat in a row in the forefront of the small crowd of passersby , who stopped , as they came and went about their marketing , to listen to the proceedings . And the elders stroked their gray beards and nodded their approval of the judgment . " But he still has my money , " said the fat man angrily . " You have heard the law of Moses as the Lord God of Israel gave it to him , " said the judge and turned his watery old eyes toward the next litigants . " It is an evil law , " said the angry man ; but he tossed the poor man his cloak as they made way for the next pair ? two farmers , one of whom was leading a limping ox . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my ox was broken while working for my neighbor and now he refuses to pay for the hurt to my beast which can no longer pull as he used to . " " Were you with the beast when his leg was broken ? " asked the judge . " Indeed I was with it , " shouted the owner of the ox ,  | " for it is a very valuable beast and I would not entrust it alone to any man . " " Read him the law , " said the judge to the scribe ; " you will find it in the second part of the Book of Remembrance . " And the scribe , who had been searching among his tablets , unwound the great scroll until he found the place and read : And if a man borrow aught from his neighbor , and if it be hurt , or die , the owner thereof not being with it , he shall surely make restitution . If the owner thereof be with it , he shall not make it good : If it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have only to pay for its hire , " said the judge to the second farmer ; and , waving the two away , he motioned to the next three who stood waiting , a stout red-faced man , a young girl , and a youth , to come near . And at once the father began speaking irately of the outrage done to his daughter ; but the judge silenced him with a weary gesture of one bony white hand , saying , " I know , I know well what has happened , " and he turned to the youth : " Now what have you to say ? " And the lad spoke , but so softly that the aged judge could not hear . He cupped his hand to his ear and said : " Speak up , speak up ! Surely you were not so shy with the maiden or you would not now be here ; " and loud laughter broke from the large crowd of passersby which had suddenly gathered . Then the youth raised up his voice and said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Was she a virgin ? " asked the judge . But before the youth could answer him the father shouted : " Indeed she was a virgin and he shall pay the price of a virgin ! "  | " You know nothing about this , " said the judge . " Be still . " And he turned to the daughter : " Were you a virgin ? " And the girl nodded yes . " And I want her for my wife , " cried the youth , " but " But I will not have that son of Belial for my son-inlaw , " shouted the father , " and he shall pay the price " Then the judge silenced them both with his white hands upraised . " Read them the law of Moses , " he said to the scribe , who had unrolled the scroll to the place . And the scribe read : And if a man entice a virgin that is not betrothed , and lie with her , he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins . " You will have to pay , " the judge said to the downcast youth ; and seeing that no more litigants awaited his judgment he rose up from the bench , though he saw Zvuv come pushing through the crowd crying , " I have a complaint ! I have a complaint ! " " And what is your complaint , Zvuv ? " the aged judge asked ; but the elders and half of the crowd went away . And Zvuv shouted , " There is a sorcerer at the Gate of the Wineshops , and he professes to be able to perform all the miracles of Moses ! " " A sorcerer ? " asked the judge . " Have we any law regarding a sorcerer ? " he asked of the scribe . And the scribe , after searching the scroll and shuffling the tablets , took up a small one and read : Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live . " Ah , " said the old judge , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have we ! and the scribe shook his head . " You see , Zvuv , we have no law against a sorcerer.  | Now if it were a sorceress ? " He waved his bony hands wearily and left the bench . And Zvuv cried after him harshly , " When Joshua , the son of Nun who brought the children of Israel into Canaan , had died , the Lord raised them up judges to judge them ; and now their judges need judging .... " But the venerable judge hurried off , the scribe rolled up the scroll and gathered up the tablets , and the remainder of the heedless crowd melted away from Zvuv , but for Naomi who , since Tobias had not yet appeared , remained standing there beside him . And when Zvuv ceased speaking she said to him : " It might help matters if a woman judged again in Israel ; then would a sorcerer fare no better than a sorceress . " But Zvuv only gave her a look of disdain and turned and went across the crowded market place toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , still seeking Tobias who was nowhere to be seen . Nor was he among the many men idling and drinking there outside the wineshops listening to the music of a harp and a lute , a tabret and a pipe , while watching the black-robed sorcerer who was boasting that he could perform all the miracles of Moses save only the division of the Red Sea . And to prove it he poured pure water into an empty jar ; and then having waved a wand and said certain mystical words he emptied the jar out onto the ground , making a bright bloody stain there , saying : " Thus did Moses change the waters of Egypt to blood ! " And the drinkers were tossing him pieces of silver and demanding that he change his wand to a snake , when Zvuv approached him crying : " Begone , you slanderer of Moses , with your sleight of hand ! " And Zvuv upset the jar , revealing the powdered herbs concealed therein with which the trick  | had been done . The sorcerer hastened to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger of Zvuv , who then turned upon the drinkers in the wineshops crying : " Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning to take strong drink ; and that tarry late into the night till the wine inflame them , and listen to the harp and the lute , the tabret and the pipe , but regard not the work of the Lord . Such a people will go into captivity ; their enemies will come upon them , as it has been with the children of Israel again and again in times past , when their backsliding has brought upon them first Edom , and then Moab , and then the Philistines , and then the Canaanites , and then the Midianites , and then the Ammonites , and then again the Philistines , and now have we not had word again of marauders from Moab ... " But none of the drinkers gave him any heed , for they were watching a passing harlot who wore tinkling silver bells on her ankles . Her eyelids were dark and heavy with kohl , and her perfume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men among the drinkers began singing to her : I 've come into my garden , My sister , my bride : I have gathered my spice with my myrrh ; I have eaten my honey with my honeycomb ; I have drunk my wine with my milk : So eat , O my friends , and drink ; Yea , let us drink deep of love ! And Zvuv , enraged , shouted shameful words after the harlot , and he cried : At every post will she sit down , And open her quiver for any arrow !  | And he turned again upon the singers , saying bitterly : " You do indeed hear , but understand not ; and you do indeed see , but perceive not ! " And still the drinkers did not heed him and continued their singing : Open to me , My sister , my love .. . And Naomi went to stand beside Zvuv and she said : " I have heard it said that the Lord kept the children of Israel wandering in the wilderness for forty years so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . It is too bad that he did not keep them there longer . But what is the good of your great anger , Zvuv ? Was not Moses himself the meekest of men , and did he not say , My doctrine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall distil as the dew , as the small rain upon the tender grass , and as the showers upon the herb ; for I will proclaim the word of the Lord ! " Zvuv turned his burning eyes upon the old eyes of Naomi and said aloud so that all about them could hear : " Go your way , woman . Did not Moses cast down and break the tablets of the law in his great anger at sight of the children of Israel worshiping the golden calf ? And what do you know of the sinfulness of the men of Israel today ? Whoredom and wine take away their understanding . They turn from the Lord and go after Baal . They go up to the high place of the Jebusites in Jerusalem , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains and burn incense under the oaks and poplars and terebinths , and their daughters commit whoredom and adultery . Their women buy images of Ashtar and worship her in secret , bringing her offerings and burning incense before her . And see there  | how they spend their days under the sun in self-indulgence ! " And he spat three times toward the richly dressed matrons and maidens , who crowded the sweetshops and the perfume bazaars and stood waiting outside the booth of two Ammonite crones who told them their fortunes and sold them magic charms and small full-breasted figures of Ashtar with the serpent writhing upon her . And Zvuv shouted at them : " Know you not , 0 women of Israel , that unlike the gods of Ammon and Moab , the Lord God of Israel is unchanging and unchangeable ; that no magic can move him ; that only in his laws can you find the way to life ! " But the women heeded him no more than did the men ; and the Ammonite crones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " This charm will bring you love ! And Ashtar will bring children to your house ! " Zvuv screamed : " Woe to such women ! Moses said : Ye saw no manner of form on the day that the Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire , lest ye corrupt yourselves and make you a graven image in the form of any figure , the likeness of male or female . And I say , woe to you , women of Bethlehem ! " " And your wife , Zvuv , " said Naomi standing beside him , " what manner of woman is she now ? I remember her as a young maiden , gentle and virtuous . " Zvuv answered her angrily : " My wife is a contentious woman . And three things are said of a contentious woman : It is better to dwell in a desert land than with a contentious woman . And again : It is better to dwell alone in a corner of a housetop than in a palace with a contentious woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a contentious woman are alike ; he that would stop her stoppeth the wind . "  | And Naomi said : " I thought so . And you , Zvuv , are a first-born son , are you not ? " Zvuv said : " It is indeed so . I am a first-born son . Like Sarah the beloved wife of Abraham and like Rachel the beloved wife of Jacob , my mother was long barren . Then she went to the tomb of Rachel and there prayed our Mother Rachel to intercede with the Lord for his bounty . And ? " " But , " said Naomi , " if the Lord God of Israel is unchanging and unchangeable would the prayer of a woman or even the intercession of our Mother Rachel move him to open her womb ? " Zvuv said impatiently : " You know very well that barren women in Israel have done this ever since Rachel died in childbirth on the way to Bethlehem and was buried there by the roadside . And when I was born my mother dedicated me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first born of thy sons shalt thou give unto me . " And Naomi looked upon the gaunt face and burning eyes of Zvuv and she said again : " I thought so . " And when Zvuv asked why , she said : " Because you are so troubled . A first-born son with a contentious wife : what man could be more sorely troubled ! And I have observed also that the wives of prophets are often either shrews or harlots . " Then Zvuv said in anger : " It is not my fault that my wife is a shrew . Were she a worthy woman she would take pride in my service to the Almighty . " And Naomi said : " I did not say it was your fault , though I thank the Lord it has not been my lot to be the wife of a prophet . " And Zvuv , looking into her wise old eyes , asked anxiously : " Can you then tell me , Naomi , what is it that ails my wife ? ? Why she who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harridan with a hateful heart  --  as vinegar to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes ? " Naomi said : " The sins of the fathers are doubtless visited not only on the sons but on the daughters , and through them on the sons-in-law also . And I remember well how rich Simeon , whose youngest daughter you married , was brought before my Elimelech in judgment for having gone up to the high place in Jerusalem when he went there to trade with the Jebusites until a sickness and a madness overcame him ; and how it grieved my Elimelech that Simeon had to be stoned to death in the gate . And Elimelech sitting in judgment said then , I remember , that Moses , long suffering and patient as he was , even with his enemies , had been intolerant only of evil  --  which must be destroyed because it has the power to maintain itself alive to the third and the fourth generation . So may it not be that it is because of her father Simeon that your wife is a shrew ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress and your discontent to the chastisement of your people ? Not that they do not deserve and need it . But a contented husband , it seems to me , is not so likely to become a prophet . " Then Zvuv cried out : " But what can I do with her now ? What can I do ? " And Naomi answered him pityingly : " You are so wise , Zvuv ; you who know all the laws of Moses and the will of the Almighty . But you do n't know how to deal with a willful woman . Surely not with prophetic anger , for is it not said : An angry man stirreth up strife ; and a wrathful man aboundeth in transgression . " And Zvuv said wrathfully : Woe to the rebellious , saith the Lord , that take counsel but not of me ; and that cover with a covering but not of my spirit , that they may add sin to sin .  | Naomi said : " That may well be true of you and your wife , Zvuv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not know what ails his unhappy wife might have some difficulty discerning the will of his God . It is becoming the custom for some men in Israel to speak as if the Lord God of Israel spoke to and through them as he did with Moses . Now I have no love for the men of Moab or their gods which are abominable ; but in all the ten years I lived in Moab I never heard a Moabite say he had spoken with his god ! " And Zvuv said impatiently : " Go your way , woman ! What do you know of the nature of the Lord God of Israel , who speaks often to those who know him ? " Naomi said : " I have tried to know him as well as any man ; but it is difficult to know anyone , whether man or god , who does not speak to you . And the Lord God of Israel has never spoken to me , nor to any woman since Eve so far as I know , except through men . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to chide her for wrongdoing and since then to none other ; while , though men have been equally erring and sinful the Lord knows , he has continued to speak to them on occasion : to Abraham but not to Sarah ; to Isaac but not to Rebekah ; to Jacob but not to Rachel or Leah . And so we women , to whom God does not speak , have to do his will as best we can without such guidance . " Zvuv said : " You have the guidance of the men to whom God speaks . " And Naomi said : " Nevertheless , you men to whom God speaks and has given great wisdom are not always as right as you think . If , for example , Rebekah had listened to Isaac , wild Esau and not gentle Jacob would have been the father of Israel , would he not ? And now it seems to me you are wrong in thinking that my Ruth , who left her  | land to live under the wing of the Lord God of Israel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zvuv did not let her finish speaking . He spat on the ground and said : " An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord . Do you not fear the Lord ? " Naomi said : " Why should I only fear the Lord God of Israel ? Has he not also said to us , And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart ? Is not the Lord God of Israel a lover of love , jealous of the love and the faithfulness of his people ? And indeed I have loved him for his bounty , when he filled my life and gave me a good husband and sons to gladden my heart . But the Almighty has afflicted me  --  he destroyed my men for their wrongdoing and I am left bereft of husband and sons , alone but for the love and loyalty of Ruth the Moabitess who But Zvuv , ignoring her pleading said aloud so that all within earshot might hear : They that feared the Lord shake one with another ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was written before him , for them that feared the Lord , and that thought upon his name . And they shall be mine , says the Lord of Hosts , in the day that I do make , even a peculiar treasure . Naomi asked : " But until then , Zvuv , what until that day ? " And Zvuv looked impatiently upon her , saying : " Thus does my wife speak also , saying continually , But what now  --  what now ? ' It is no use talking to a woman ! " And he turned away from Naomi and left her standing there , and went off shouting : Behold the day cometh , it burneth as a furnace ; and all the proud , and all that work in wickedness shall be stubble ; and the day that cometh shall burn them up , saith the Lord of hosts . . . . And the Ammonite crones cackled and called to Naomi ,  | the one saying : " Why dost thou go after that sapless creature ? He is no lover of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee a lusty man ; anyone thou dost want . Thou hast only to name him and we will bring him here to thee with our dark powers . " Then Naomi laughed , saying : " Thank the Lord I no longer have need of a lusty man , though it is indeed a man I have come here to seek . " And the crone said : " It matters not to us if it be love or money thou dost want of a man . Come tell us his name . It will cost thee nothing if we fail to bring him . " And Naomi , jesting , said : " Then bring me Tobias the merchant . " And the crone called the other one to her and they took a brazier between them and boiled a brew over which they were mumbling an incantation when Tobias appeared , hastening across the market place toward the Gate of the Judges . And Naomi called after him : " Tobias , Tobias ! " But he would not stop until she ran and stood in his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tobias looked upon her in ill-humor and said sourly : " It appeared to me when you left my house on the night of Passover that you would not be wanting to see me again . Surely you do not wish to speak to a mealymouthed hypocrite . Is it possible that you and your proud Moabitess need me after all ? " " It is about the property of Elimelech , " Naomi said patiently . " I wish to sell ? " But Tobias brushed her aside saying : " I have no wish to buy your neglected property ; and I have to appear now before the judges with seven of my workmen . " And he hastened away and left Naomi standing alone . " Thou didst not do very well with that one , didst thou , "  | the old crones called to her . " Come let us get thee another . Try a younger man this time . How about that one over there , wouldst thou not like him ? " Naomi looked to where they were pointing and saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like burnished copper in the sun . And a merchant stood holding the horse 's head and talked earnestly to Boaz , while the merchant 's richly dressed wife and his daughter , their arms covered with jeweled bracelets , their fingers with rings , stood by , waiting expectantly . And Naomi went to stand nearby them and she heard the merchant pleading : " But I will give you a herd of the finest cattle , Boaz , beside the three thousand shekels ! " Boaz said gently but firmly : " Nevertheless , the answer remains , no ; and I must go now to sit in judgment . " And he took the merchant 's hand from his horse 's head and said , " Let us go , Yohfe , " and turned away toward the Gate of the Judges . And Naomi went and stood in the way of the horse and spoke to Boaz saying : " You are Boaz , kinsman of Tobias , the merchant , are you not ? " And he halted the horse , saying : " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Moab . What is it you want of me ? " She said : " Only a foolish woman would tell a man what she wants of him . Men being contrary creatures , the best a woman can do is to make it easy for a man to discover that for himself and to pray that it will please him to grant what she wishes . " And Boaz smiled as his handsome gray eyes gravely searched her withered face , and he said : " But why have you stopped me , Naomi ? " And she said : " It is to give thanks for your kindness to  | Ruth the Moabitess who gleans in your fields and has brought me full measures of your good grain . " Boaz said : " It is not kindness I have done you or the Moabitess . Is it not commanded us that we provide for the widow and the stranger ? " And he turned his horse from her and rode through the throng toward the Gate of the Judges , as fine a figure of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Naomi heard the merchant complaining loudly to his wife and daughter , who stood gazing enviously after the great catch that had got away from them : " He must want a fortune for a dowry ! " And Naomi said : " Had I a fortune I would gladly give it to him for a dowry . " " And for whom ? " said the bitterly disappointed matron . " Would it be for the Moabitess you brought back with you ? " Naomi said : " Indeed , for my daughter , Ruth . And why not ? " " As if it were not hard enough as it is , " shrilled the irate mother , " to get a good husband for the maidens of Bethlehem , you must bring one of those shameless strangers here who goes down to work in the fields as no delicately reared maiden would do and there catches the eyes of our men . We have heard how your Ruth has got herself into the good graces of Boaz , who feeds her and protects her from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Then , " said Naomi , " why do you not take all those trappings off your delicately reared darling , those silks and jewels and perhaps even the paint off her face , and send her down to the fields also ? Perhaps it will change her like my Ruth , who was a princess in Moab , into a sturdy and  | handsome young woman for whom a robust man might have some use . Perhaps your daughter will fare better down there . " " My Sara is not a Moabite wanton , " screamed the enraged matron . " Do you think your Ruth is getting those favors from Boaz for nothing ? " Whereupon Naomi sprang upon her , pulled her bejeweled headdress awry , and would have torn her fine cloak from her back had not the merchant intervened and hustled his women away . " Ha , ha ! " cackled the two crones from their booth . " Thou art not having much luck today , old woman . Shall we get thee still another man ? " And Naomi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attire . " Then try again , " they screamed , " the first one we got thee . An old man needs coaxing , " screeched the one . " Especially when the woman is not young herself , " squealed the other . Naomi turned away from their cackling and returned to the Gate of the Judges . There the three judges of Judah now sat on the bench together , attended by the scribe of the court . Boaz was in the middle , stalwart and thoughtful . The venerable judge , who had returned , sat on his right hand , and a burly blackbearded man sat on his left . Before the judges stood Tobias and two of the seven workmen who had come to ask judgment of their grievances against him . And behind the judges , perched like a gaunt raucous bird on the heap of stone missiles piled by the square stone gate tower , sat Zvuv , screaming his commentaries on the proceedings : " And Moses said , " Zvuv pointed his angry beak at Tobias : Beware lest thou forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his judgments and his statutes which I command thee this day ; lest when thou hast eaten and art full , and hast built goodly houses and dwelt therein ; and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply , and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied , then thine heart be lifted up , and thou forget the Lord thy God which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage ; who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness , wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions , and thirsty ground where no water was ; who brought thee forth water out of the flinty rock ; who fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew not ; that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to do thee good in the end ; lest thou say in thine heart , My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth ... . The scribe was trying to read from the scroll but could not make himself heard above Zvuv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zvuv crying : " Be quiet ! The rich and the poor , God made them both . " And Boaz said to Zvuv : " Let the judges judge here . " And when Zvuv had ceased he said to the scribe : " Read the law . It is the fourth of the ten commandments . " The scribe read : Remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy . Six days shalt thou labor , and do all thy work ; but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God : in it thou shalt not do any work ; thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thy cattle , nor thy stranger that is within thy gates : For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in them is , and rested the seventh day ; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it .  | Then Boaz said to Tobias : " Note well that the law says : nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument that these men , being Philistines , have never had any sabbath in their own land and expected none here is no excuse for you to disobey the commandment of the Lord God of Israel . " " But , " said Tobias , " having these strangers to work for us on the sabbath makes it easier for us to keep the sabbath of the Lord . As when one of the judges , " and here he looked first at the aged judge and then at the burly blackbearded one , " has wished to visit my house for a feast on the sabbath day it was possible for me to send these two Philistines with a litter for him and save him the labor of coming on foot . " And the black-bearded judge said hastily : " There is something in what Tobias has said about making it easier for us to observe But Boaz turned from him to the aged judge who was having difficulty , even with his hand cupped to his ear , in hearing what was being said . And Boaz shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the law of the sabbath shall be strictly adhered to ? " " Yes , yes ! " said the old judge . " Indeed , yes ! " " But , " Tobias complained , " it is the law for Israelites and not for the Philistines . " Boaz said to Tobias : " We are told that even our ancient father Abraham said of the Lord that he is the Judge of all the earth . And the Lord God of Israel said unto Moses : There shall be one statute for you and for the stranger that sojourneth with you ; as ye are , so shall the stranger be before the Lord ; one law and one ordinance shall be for you and for the stranger that sojourneth with you . Is it not so ? " he asked of the scribe .  | The scribe looked up from the scroll of the Book of Remembrance and said : " It is indeed so ; and he also said to Moses : Ye shall have one manner of law , as well for the stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your God . " Then Boaz said to Tobias : " So , see to it , Tobias , that hereafter all your workmen , stranger as well as homeborn , can keep the sabbath day . " And turning to the Philistine he said : " When you return to your land , tell your people how we in Israel deal with the stranger among us . " And to the crowd gathered there he said : " In this way shall come to pass the promise of the Almighty to Israel in Jacob 's dream when he said : In your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed . " The two Philistines then departed from before the judges and two of the five remaining workmen came forward , one of them loudly complaining that Tobias , having lent them their wages in advance because of their poverty , was charging them usury . And when they had finished speaking their complaint , Boaz said to the scribe : " Read the law . " And the scribe read from the scroll : Thou shalt not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usury of victuals , usury of anything that is lent upon usury . Unto a foreigner thou mayest lend upon usury ; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury ; that the Lord thy God may bless thee And Tobias cried out : " But one of these two is no Israelite . That one is from Ammon ! Of him I may take usury . And is it not true also that the law which says we may not eat of the animal which dies of itself and is not slaughtered  --  that law says the meat may be given to the stranger to eat ? So tell me , Boaz , where now is that one  | manner of law , as well for the stranger as for the homeborn ! And if you deny me the usury from the Ammonite I shall go to the High Priest of the Tabernacle at Shiloh and get justice there . " And Boaz looked perplexed and beckoned to the scribe to bring him the scroll , which he scrutinized and then passed to the eldest judge saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old judge stroked his white beard and considered the passage and said : " He who lends to a foreigner runs the risk that the borrower may go and return to his land taking the loan with him . Hence is the lender permitted to ask usury of the foreigner . " " And that is just , " said Boaz , returning the scroll to the scribe . " Hence , Tobias , you will return to the Israelite his usury . But the Ammonite must pay for his loan ; unless he wishes to remain here and be circumcised and become as one of us . " Whereupon Zvuv from his rock pile began screaming again : " Moses said : An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord ; even to their tenth generation . " And the frightened Ammonite did not tarry to consider the judgment of Boaz but went quickly away with the Israelite who had won his complaint . And Naomi , who stood nearby the bench of the judges saw a look of distress in the grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the remaining three of Tobias ' seven workmen , who had been squatting down on their haunches , stood up before the judges and complained that Tobias refused to pay them the wages he had promised , because the cargo of iron and brass which they had dug for him from his hills had been stolen from their caravan by the Moabite raiders .  | Then Tobias said indignantly : " Having lost the value of the metal shall I also pay wages to these three who did not deliver it where they were sent ? " To which the three workmen replied that they had been promised their wages not for delivery of the metal but for the time spent in the service of Tobias , laboring in his mines and driving his camels . The judges looked to the scribe , who searched among his tablets and in the scroll of the Book of Remembrance for a law to suit this case ; and Tobias swore that he had promised the men wages only upon delivery of the iron and brass ; and the men swore that Tobias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a swift witness against the false swearers and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages and heed not my commandments , says the Lord of hosts . . . and a great crowd of passersby gathered about the court to watch the outcome . And Tobias was very angry and shouted at Zvuv : " Be still , you bird of prey ! " And Zvuv in a frenzy answered him : There is a generation whose teeth are as swords , their great teeth as knives , to devour the poor from off the earth , and the needy from among men ! And Tobias appealed to the judges , saying : " Shall I have no consideration because I am rich ? You , my kinsman , Boaz , are also rich . And you , " he cried to the blackbearded judge , " have not disdained to receive gifts from my riches ; and you , " he shouted to the aged one , " have gladly taken your ease in my litters and in my summer house in the hills ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Moses said , Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy  | gates , which the Lord thy God giveth thee throughout thy tribes : and they shall judge the people with just judgment . Thou shalt not wrest judgment ; thou shalt not respect persons ; neither take a gift : for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise and pervert the words of the righteous . " And seeing the scribe motion to the judges that he could find no suitable law , Zvuv raised his birdlike beak and screamed to them : Open your mouths , judge righteously and plead the cause of the poor and the needy ! Then Boaz silenced him saying : " You need have no fear , Zvuv , that my kinship to Tobias will incline me in his favor ; nor that his gifts will sway any of the judges ; nor will we be swayed by the poverty of his workmen . For Moses said : Neither shalt thou favor a poor man in his cause . And again he said : Thou shalt not respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mighty ; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor . And Moses charged all the judges of Israel saying : Hear the causes between your brethren , and judge righteously between a man and his brother , and the stranger that is with him . Ye shall not respect persons in judgment ; ye shall hear the small and the great alike ; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man , for the judgment is God 's . And now I bid you , Zvuv , to refrain from further comment , however just it may be , during our judgment . " And Boaz turned for a judgment to the aged judge who quavered : " We must not oppress the poor to be sure , but on the other hand , " and he faltered , casting a fearful glance at Tobias , " these workmen were responsible for the iron and brass entrusted to them and we must consider the loss Tobias has suffered already . " Then Boaz turned for a judgment to the black-bearded one who said very quickly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the poor , God made them both ; and the Lord God of Israel promised to us the fatness of this land  --  as Moses said : this land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass  --  but were it not for Tobias who set these men to work on the hills of the land we should get no iron and brass from them . Therefore my judgment is for Tobias . " And Zvuv from his rock pile screamed again : He that justifieth the wicked and he that condemneth the righteous , even they both are an abomination to the Lord ! Then Boaz , having silenced him with a stern look , said to Tobias : " And where was this iron and brass being sent ? " And Tobias answered him : " To the Philistines , who offered me the best price for them . " Boaz said with indignation : " To the Philistines , the enemies of Israel who already have more weapons than we have and who would make of your iron and brass more spears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tobias , incensed , cried out : " You who have just been so considerate of a Philistine would now deny me the right to trade with them . Where is your justice ? Well , Boaz , there is no king in Israel , and every man does what is right in his own eyes ! " But a loud murmur against Tobias rose up from the elders and then from the crowd which had gathered before the court . And Boaz stood up from the bench and said : " It is said : The poor man and the oppressor meet together ; the Lord gives life to them both . And have we not all one father ? Has not one God created us ? Why then do we deal treacherously every man against his brother , profaning the covenant of our fathers ? " And Tobias shouted : " But the middle one there is not my brother . He is a Jebusite ; he came to sojourn here from  | Jerusalem , where they sit on their walls and spit and throw stones upon us as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lebanon . The other two will I pay the half of their hire ; but that one will I pay nothing . And do not tell me now that there is one law for the stranger and the homeborn alike , for there is no law for this case , and in any case the law is not always the same . " And Boaz said : " Moses said of the Lord God of Israel : He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and the widow , and he loveth the stranger , in giving him food and raiment . Love ye therefore the stranger : for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt ! " Then Tobias said in a sly voice : " We have heard , Boaz , that you are indeed a lover of the stranger , even of a Moabite stranger , and how generous you are to the stranger . But this ? " and he pointed to the Jebusite ? " this is no dark-eyed woman . " And loud laughter rose up from the crowd . And the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand nearby Tobias ; and she saw again the distress in the grave eyes of Boaz as he lifted his voice above the laughter of the crowd and said : " How shall it come to pass that In your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed if you remember only that strangers have been hateful and hostile to you , and you do not welcome the stranger who comes to sojourn with you and to share with you the blessing of the Lord God of Israel ? " The laughter of the crowd then ceased , and he said : " My judgment is that Tobias shall pay his three workmen their full promised hire  --  the stranger alike with the homeborn . " And the crowd cheered Boaz ; and the other two judges , seeing that the people were with Boaz and against Tobias , agreed also to the judgment of Boaz . And Tobias , crestfallen ,  | said : " I will pay them tomorrow . " But Boaz said : " Pay them now , for Moses said : The wages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until morning . " And Tobias reluctantly opened his purse and paid them the silver due them . Then Boaz and the other two judges rose up and left the bench and the crowd of passersby dispersed , leaving only the gray-bearded elders sighing and talking among themselves of how judgment in the gates had fallen upon evil days when the laws of Moses were no longer as clear as they used to be in the days when the elders were young . Then Zvuv came down from the rock pile and Tobias went to him in great anger saying : " You have eaten and drunk at my table and slept in my house when your wife would not open your door to you ; and yet you come here and speak against me before the judges ! " Zvuv said : " I am a prophet of the Lord God of Israel who said : Remember ye the law of Moses , my servant , which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel ! " And Tobias said testily : " I could well do without prophets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill humor and went toward the Gate of the Wineshops ; and he would have gone into one of the shops but that Naomi , who had come close behind him , stood in his way . Tobias tried to brush the old woman briskly aside but Naomi stood steadfast before him saying : " You have lost many shekels , Tobias ; but you can regain them and more if you will but take the great bargain I have come to give you . " Tobias asked : " What bargain ? " And Naomi said : " The property of Elimelech which I am offering for sale . True , it has been long neglected ; but I shall let it go cheap for that reason . What can I , a poor woman , do with it ? But with a bit of improvement in the  | hands of a shrewd man like you , Tobias , it will soon be as fertile as it was when Elimelech worked it , and worth twice again what you paid for it . " Tobias looked dubious , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him : " Just come and consider it , Tobias . That will cost you nothing . " And he saw her desperation ; and Tobias the merchant knew very well that he could get a bargain from one who sorely wished to sell , especially from a woman . So he went with her to go out of the Gate of the Wineshops . And as they passed by the booth of the Ammonite crones , the two called after Naomi : " Art thou not going to pay us ? " " We got him for thee after all , did we not ? " And Naomi , to shut their shrill toothless mouths , tossed them a bit of silver . Now Tobias was walking across the land of Elimelech , observing the fallen fences and terrace walls , the soil washed away by the rains , the weeds in the unkempt meadows , and the tangled vines and trees in the unpruned vineyard and orchard . Tobias observed , too , how Ruth came riding her milkwhite donkey up the hill from the fields of Boaz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came bearing so gracefully the burden of her gleaning , her lovely head held high , her shapely hips swinging as she moved through the fragrant air of spring , her feet gleaming white in the green flowery grasses . And Ruth was singing a song she had learned from the women gleaning in the field :  | My beloved is white and ruddy , Towering above ten thousand ; His head is as the most fine gold , His locks are curled and black as the raven . His eyes are like doves beside water-brooks , Washed with milk and most fitly set . His cheeks are as beds of spices , as banks of sweet herbs ; His lips are like lilies , flowing with myrrh . His hands are rods of gold , set with bright beryl ; His body is polished ivory , overlain with sapphires . His legs are pillars of marble , set in sockets of gold ; His look is like Lebanon , upright as the cedars . His mouth is most sweet . Yea , he is altogether lovely . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her singing . And long forgotten lust stirred in the ageing man as he caught the passing glance of her dark eyes . And he spoke to her saying : " Where have you gleaned so well ? " And she said : " In the field of Boaz . " And he said : " Is it not too hard labor for you ? " And she said : " Boaz has been kind to me ; " and she went on by him . And envy of Boaz who had bested him in the gate burned in the heart of Tobias as he stood and watched lovely Ruth go like a proud princess into the broken-down house of Naomi . " And what is old Tobias doing out there ? " asked Ruth as she poured out the grain from her apron . Naomi , who was weaving at the loom , said : " He is looking at the land ; he is considering buying it . " And Ruth said with delight : " Then we shall live well !  | We will buy a good house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a servant and wilt rest from thy labors . " " Perhaps , some day it will be so , " said Naomi , sending the shuttle swiftly back and forth in her weaving ; " But I shall not spend this money for that . " And Ruth said : " Then what wilt thou do with it ? " " It will be for a dowry for you , " said Naomi . And Ruth smiled sadly : " Art thou still thinking of that ? " And Naomi said : " To be sure ! " Ruth said : " And may I ask of thee now to whom thou art going to give me with that dowry ? " " We shall see about that in due time , " said Naomi . " First let us see how much of a dowry I can get out of old Tobias . " Ruth was silent a while as Naomi wove . Then Ruth said : " And what if I should not wish to marry the man thou canst get for me with thy dowry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But are you mad , my child ? Surely you do not wish to spend the rest of your days like a slave in the fields , withering away into childless old age ! " Ruth said : " I would rather do that than bear children to a man whom I do not love . " " You are a foolish child ! " cried Naomi impatiently . " My Mahlon is dead and gone ; and even were he alive he could give you no child ; and  --  and you will do as I tell you , for life has taught me much you have yet to learn . " And Ruth answered her gently : " Thou hast indeed taught me much , Naomi ; and because of that I am no longer a child but a woman ; and I will do only as my heart prompts me . " " Your heart , your heart ! " mocked Naomi . " Your heart will only make you unhappier when I am dead and you are alone here with no man to cherish you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone than be cherished by another than the man whom I love . " Then Naomi looked sharply at Ruth saying : " Is there one here whom you love ? " And Ruth said softly : " But he hath not " and she ceased speaking for Tobias had come to the door . And Naomi said : " Well , Tobias , what will you give for the land ? " And he answered cautiously : " The land is in worse condition even than I had imagined . It is virtually worthless ; and I could hardly pay you enough to make it worth your while ; but I have in mind a plan whereby " He glanced at Ruth and ceased speaking , and stood stroking his paunch . Naomi said to Ruth : " Go get me a jar of water . " And Ruth said : " But we have two full jars , Naomi . " Naomi said : " Go get me another ; " and Ruth took up a jar and went out , followed by the eyes of Tobias , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Now what is this plan of yours ? " Tobias said : " You know that old levirate custom of ours which provides that the brother of a dead man marry his childless widow in order ? " " Indeed I know it , " said Naomi , " but what has that to do with you ? " " Well , " said Tobias , " since neither Elimelech nor Mahlon has left a living brother and I am the nearest kins-man ? " And Naomi said : " Are you indeed our nearest kins-man ? " " You know very well that I am , " said Tobias . " And as the nearest kinsman is enjoined to redeem the property which a poor man sells it has occurred to me that rather than let the land of Elimelech be sold to another I might  | redeem this worthless property for you , even though you are not a man but a woman , and give you something for it  --  something more than it is worth  --  if Ruth went with it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that you wish to marry Ruth ! " " But of course not ! " said Tobias . " A levirate marriage is enjoined only on the brother of the dead , and I am not Mahlon 's brother . Of course I would not marry a Moabitess ! Was it not commanded us : An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord ! But I would take her into my house and ? " and he stroked his round paunch as he spoke " ? and Ruth is a sturdy young woman who could make herself useful in my household . " And Naomi , watching the gleam in the eyes of Tobias , was prompted to say , " You old goat ! " but she restrained herself ; she bit her thin withered lips and held her tongue a while , and then said : " I shall speak to Ruth about it . But not while you are here . Go now . " And Tobias departed , stopping outside the door to watch Ruth come up from the well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful shoulder . " And what did the old man want ? " she asked Naomi as she set down the jar . " He wanted you , " said Naomi . And Ruth exclaimed : " Thou wouldst not ! " Naomi said drily : " No , I would not . But I would get from Tobias if I could , the dowry to get you the man you want . For better is a dinner of herbs where love is , than a stalled ox and hatred therewith . Now tell me my daughter , who is it that you love ? " Then Ruth went to Naomi and leaned her head on the old woman 's breast . " It is Boaz , " she whispered . " Oh tell  | me , Naomi , is it evil of me ? I thought never to love another . Nor have I forgotten gentle Mahlon . I did indeed love your son greatly ; but this  --  this is different . " Naomi 's face lit up ; her old eyes beamed : " Indeed this is different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . Have I not told you that the Lord God of Israel is a lover of love ; and when he said it is not good for the man to live alone he meant woman also . So look back no more , my child , neither to Moab nor to Mahlon . Look forward now to life here in Israel and to Boaz , who would indeed be a helpmeet for you . " And she kissed Ruth tenderly . " But he will come very high , my child . I have heard him turn down three thousand shekels and a herd of fine cattle . " And Ruth said : " But what good would a dowry do , even if I had more than three thousand shekels ? He has not looked upon me since that first day in the field . " Naomi said : " I have yet to see a man , rich or poor , whose eye for a woman was not brightened by a dowry ; that is , of course , if the woman herself has already found favor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinsman Tobias for the dowry  --  without his plan . Do you , meanwhile , do your best to catch the eye of Boaz again . " And Naomi , smiling , returned to her weaving . But it was not easy to catch the eye of Boaz . Whenever Ruth saw him in the fields and moved toward him she would find watchful Elias in her way , hastening to lead her away to a place where there was better gleaning ; and on the few occasions when Boaz , mounted on Yohfe , happened to come close to Ruth as he rode across the field and stopped nearby her with a look of entrancement in his  | grave gray eyes , cool-eyed Elias appeared as if from nowhere and took Boaz away to show him something that wanted his attention . And there were also women in the field who saw how the men while they refrained from molesting Ruth yet favored her by leaving behind them more grain where she gleaned and learned that Boaz had ordered it so , and thereafter they watched Ruth jealously whenever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . And then when he had gone from the field without speaking to Ruth they would smile knowingly to each other and talk to each other , loud enough for her to hear , of how rich and valiant Boaz who could have any woman in Bethlehem was finding it difficult to choose a suitable wife . And the wife of Zvuv said bitterly : " For my part , I would advise no woman to marry Boaz , rich and valiant as he is ; for there is too much thoughtfulness behind those gray eyes  --  there is too much of the prophet in him ; and the Lord God of Israel protect any woman who has to live with one of his prophets . " Only the one-handed woman gave Ruth any comfort or courage . She said : " My man was no thoughtful prophet but a lusty fighter and see to what a pass he brought me , " and she held up the sunburnt stump of her hand . " Thoughtful or lusty , prophet or farmer or fighter , any man is a trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without them , I say , get the best one you can . And this Boaz is a fine figure of a man who could give a woman great pleasure as well as much comfort . And were I as young and well favored as you , Ruth , I would go and stand before him , not when he is riding about in the field but when he is sitting still and can not but look upon you . " So Ruth ventured to do as Boaz had told her  --  to go and  | eat again the midday meal with the men , one day when Boaz was seated among them with cool-eyed Elias on his right hand and hairy-handed Gibbor on his left . And Boaz when she approached bid her sit and eat , but he was constrained in his manner toward her ; and Elias looked coldly upon her . And Gibbor sat sullenly staring at her ; until one of the two lads who were hurling stones at a tree nearby twitted Gibbor about his being a poor shot with a stone because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and answered the lad : " At the battle of Gibeah there were seven hundred chosen men of Benjamin  --  all left handed  --  every one could sling stones at a hairbreadth and not miss . And being left handed stood my great-grandfather Ehud the Benjamite in very good stead . " Ruth knew then that Gibbor and Elias would try to discomfort her in the presence of Boaz but she was determined to remain there in his sight . " In those days , " said Gibbor , returning to Ruth , " the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab ; and they sent a present by Ehud to King Eglon . I heard my grandfather tell of it many times as his father told it to him . Ehud made him a sword which had two edges of a cubit length ; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh , as I do my sword . " And Gibbor lifted his raiment to show Ruth the sword upon his thick hairy thigh . " And my great-grandfather Ehud went and offered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very fat man , and ? " There Boaz , angered by Gibbor 's display of his private parts before Ruth ; sharply interrupted Gibbor , saying : " I do not see how Ehud could have been your great-grandfather , for since his time we have had five great judges who were heroes in Israel : Shamgar who was also a Benjamite  | and routed the Philistines with an oxgoad , and Deborah , the woman , who got Barak to fight King Jabin of Canaan And Ruth to divert and calm Boaz said : " And was it not then that Jael the Kenite woman killed Sisera the general of King Jabin with a tent pin ? " Boaz said : " Indeed it was ; and a brave thing for a woman to do ; and a thing for which we should be doubly grateful seeing that Jael was not a woman of Israel . " And his words and his glance gladdened the heart of Ruth . Then Boaz turned again to Gibbor saying : " And after Deborah we had Gideon of Manasseh who routed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then Jephthah , also of Manasseh , who went out and routed the Ammonites and had to sacrifice his daughter upon his return . And then And Ruth said to Boaz : " But I thought that since Abraham no Israelite ever sacrificed a child ! " And Boaz said : " Jephthah had to : because he had vowed a vow to the Lord that if he delivered Ammon into his hand he would sacrifice whatsoever came forth first from his house upon his return , and it was his daughter , his oily child , who came forth to meet him with timbrels and dances . " Ruth said : " It was a foolish vow , for surely the Lord God of Israel was not moved by that vow to give Jephthah victory over his enemies . " And Boaz said to her : " Indeed that is wisely said . " And his admiration of her judgment was plain to be seen in the eyes of Boaz . Then Elias said to Boaz : " And who judged after Jeph-thah ? " And Boaz turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samson who slew many Philistines before they brought him low . " " With the help of a strange woman , " added Elias , glancing at Ruth . And Boaz returned quickly to Gibbor saying : " So you see that Ehud could not have been your great-grandfather . " Gibbor said : " Whether Ehud was my great-grandfather or my **35;111;TOOLONG is no matter . What matters is how he slew King Eglon of Moab . " And he looked into the dark eyes of Ruth to see if his words had discomforted her , as indeed they had . " We have all heard you tell that story more than once , " said Boaz impatiently . " But , " said Gibbor , " Ruth who is a stranger among us has not heard me tell it . " And he returned to her , saying : " And when Ehud had made an end of offering the present he sent away the people who bore it ; but he himself turned back and said to the king , I have a secret errand unto thee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you Moabites still do . And the king said to his court , Keep silence ! ' And all that stood by him went out . And Ehud came to him ; and he was sitting by himself alone in his summer parlor . And Ehud said , I have a message from God unto thee . ' And the king arose out of his seat . And Ehud put forth his left hand and took the sword from his right thigh , " Gibbor showed with his own sword in his hairy hand how it was done , " and thrust it into his belly and the haft went in after the blade and the fat closed upon the blade , for he drew not the sword out of his belly ; and it came out behind . Then Ehud went forth ? " " We have had enough of that tale , " said Boaz sternly , seeing that Ruth was ill at ease . " And it is possible , " said Gibbor , " that Ruth being a  | Moabitess of the house of Eglon has heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moab . " Then Ruth said , with uplifted head though her heart was heavy in her breast : " I am indeed of the house of Eglon and have heard the story of Ehud ; yet have I come to sojourn here among you , and to be a woman in Israel . " And Boaz looked kindly upon Ruth . Whereupon cool-eyed Elias , fearful of her fascination , said : " But I do n't think the women of Bethlehem look kindly upon your coming into the field of Boaz . The women of Bethlehem are much concerned for our Boaz . " And he began amusing the men with his mimicry of one of the matrons of Bethlehem who were trying to inveigle Boaz , the great catch , for their marriageable daughters , angling for him whenever he came up to the town : " Dear Boaz , " sighed Elias , " how you must want a home-cooked meal , living that crude life with those crude men in the fields ! You must come and let me and my Sara make you a savory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would delight to do it for you  --  would n't you , Sara ? " And Boaz though he also laughed was ill at ease , because of Ruth , who sat with downcast eyes , not eating what he had set before her . " And , " Elias went on , " When the mother can not get him for Sara the elder then Hannah the younger is permitted to fling herself at his head ! " And Gibbor said : " Baal take those women of Bethlehem ! I would welcome a woman of Moab any time she would have me . " And while the men laughed aloud , Ruth rose up hastily and went and returned to the fields . And since Boaz could not chide Elias and the men for their laughter without confessing that this strange woman had found great favor in his eyes , Boaz kept silent .  | But he asked Gibbor to stay with him when the others had finished eating and Elias blew his horn and led them back to the reaping . And when they had gone Boaz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moabitess in the field ; but just now you vexed her with your talk of King Eglon . Moses said : If a stranger sojourn with thee in your land , ye shall not do him wrong . But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as the homeborn among you , and thou shalt love him as thyself . " And Gibbor laughingly said : " Why then when I wished to make love to her did you stop me , Boaz ? " And Boaz turned from him , saying sadly : " You are a man of little understanding . " Then Gibbor said : " I confess that I do not understand you , Boaz ; for I thought when you forbid us to molest the Moabitess that you wanted her for yourself . But it appears now that you do not . You are like the dog in the manger that barks the other beasts away , though he himself has no use for the fodder . " Then Boaz said : " I am not asking you to understand me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these times . All the same , my too lusty friend , I want you to keep away from that woman . " And Gibbor went from him with a shrug .  | TOWARD THE END of the barley harvest  --  seven weeks after the Passover  --  came the Feast of Weeks . And everyone who could go then would make the pilgrimage up to Shiloh , carrying the first fruits of the harvest to the tabernacle there for the service of sacrifice and thanksgiving to the Lord God of Israel . " And we shall make two loaves of shewbread for the altar , " said Naomi to Ruth , who was working at the loom . " It is a merry festival . All the young men and women go up , not only from Bethlehem but from all of Judah and the other tribes of Israel , and many marriages come of it . This is the time of year when men are most easily moved to marriage . And this is your best chance to be seen and considered by Boaz , all the way up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by another . There are other valiant young men in Israel . " " I will marry no other man , " said Ruth without raising her eyes from her weaving . " But what is the good of his looking upon me when I am so ill clad ? " And Naomi said : " You are more beautiful in your worn garments than many another who goes clothed in fresh spun silks ; and if Boaz can not see that then he is blinder than most men . " " Nevertheless , " said Ruth , " I wish that I had a new  | dress . " And she stopped her weaving and held up the end of the length of cloth she had made and stared at it saying : " Why not ? " and stood up , holding it against her body , saying : " Why make more curtains for the windows ? " Naomi looked at Ruth and said : " Why , indeed ? " And she brought her bronze shears and helped cut and fit the cloth upon Ruth 's fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earrings Elimelech gave me for our betrothal , " said Naomi . So they went with the throng riding northward along the sunny road to Shiloh , in the cavalcade of camels and donkeys headed by the standard bearing the lion of Judah , which set out from Bethlehem in the early morning , gaily garlanded with flowers and fruits and burdened with beasts of sacrifice and baskets of harvest grains . Among the happy harvesters and their womenfolk singing songs of thanksgiving under the bright blue sky of the land of Israel rode Ruth , beautiful in her new raiment with the great hoops of gold shining at her ears . And tied to the saddle of her milk-white donkey Ruth bore proudly the two long plaited loaves of shewbread she and Naomi had baked of fine flour for the Lord God of Israel and enclosed in molds of clay lest they be marred on the journey up to the tabernacle . But Naomi had not told Ruth that some women of Bethlehem had said they would not let the bread of the Moabitess be offered together with theirs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God , because their corruption is in them ; nor how Naomi had brought the  | women before the judges in the city gate where Boaz had said : " Ruth the widow of Mahlon is not merely a foreigner ; she is a stranger sojourning among us ; and Moses also said : If a stranger sojourn with you and will offer an offering of a sweet savour unto the Lord , as ye do so he shall do . " And Ruth riding among the maidens raised her sweet voice and sang with the rest : Make a joyful noise to the Lord , all ye lands , Serve ye the Lord with gladness ; Come unto his presence singing .. . Then Naomi , riding beside Ruth , drew her away from the others so that their garlanded donkeys rode as near as possible to the two horses on which Boaz and Elias rode , Boaz on Yohfe , his burnished-copper stallion , and Elias on his snow-white mare , followed by Gibbor on a camel so heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow moving in that multitude that Naomi , fortunately , could keep up with them . And though Elias whenever he saw Boaz looking upon the loveliness of Ruth would do his best to divert his friend or to find some reason to canter ahead of the throng with him , there was no doubt in Naomi 's mind that she was succeeding in getting the entranced eyes of Boaz fixed upon Ruth as she rode and sang with the pilgrims : Know ye the Lord he is God ; It is he that made us , we are his ; We are his people , the sheep of his pasture . . . But there were other eyes also upon Ruth : the irate eyes of the matrons of Bethlehem  --  among them that one who had quarrelled with Naomi at the city gates  --  and these saw how the simply adorned beauty of the Moabitess drew  | the avid eyes of the young men from their own daughters whom they had tricked out for this festive occasion when the young men looked about them thinking to choose wives from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goatish eyes of Tobias , who trailed alongside Naomi , plaguing her in whispers to get Ruth to agree to his plan . For Naomi , for all the shrewdness of her talk with Tobias , had thus far failed to persuade him to purchase the land without giving him Ruth . And now , on the way to Shiloh , Naomi tried again to get what she wanted of Tobias . She let Ruth ride ahead while she guided her dove-gray donkey alongside the laden camel of Tobias and patiently argued with him that Ruth , being a princess of Moab , where they did things differently , was not used to that kind of arrangement . " And it hurts her pride , " said Naomi , " that you will not take her in levirate marriage though you are the nearest kinsman of Elimelech and Mahlon . " " Her pride ! " said Tobias , " a Moabitess ! " " Yet , " said Naomi , shrugging her bony shoulders , " she is a daughter of the house of King Eglon who ruled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought like a slave , Tobias . Now if you will but buy the property first I can then say to Ruth : I have sold this land and our house to Tobias and he has bid us come into his household where we can rest in comfort . ' And with the money you give me I can buy her fine clothing and jewels for her adornment which will surely please and persuade her , and should please you , too , Tobias , " she added . " But first you must purchase the property ; and at a price which will make my plan possible ; and you had better do it soon , Tobias ; for you can see very well for yourself how the young men are drawn to the beauty of Ruth . "  | And Tobias , looking ahead saw that Ruth 's milk-white donkey was flanked by the mounts of several young men  --  including even his grandson , the lad Joel , who having just turned thirteen was making his first pilgrimage to Shiloh among the men of Israel . And their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet voice and Joel 's broken half-childish one among the strong voices of the young men : When Israel went forth out of Egypt , The house of Jacob from a strange people ; Judah became his sanctuary , And Israel his dominion . The sea saw it , and fled ; Jordan was driven back . The mountains skipped like rams , The little hills like lambs . Naomi said to Tobias : " See there between Joel and Ruth rides Naaman , your nephew , whose look is intent on Ruth . He is not too wise a young man but he is lusty and he can afford as well as you to pay for whatever he wants . And it seems to me that the eyes of our kinsman Boaz also rest upon Ruth  --  not without interest , Tobias . Indeed one might think him jealous of Naaman . " And Tobias saw how though his own daughter Reba rode close beside Boaz he gave her not a single one of his glances , which returned again and again to Ruth . Tobias the aging man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . But Tobias the shrewd merchant , when it came to giving up money , was very cautious . He never gave money without security ; and where was his security with this strange and willful young woman ? It was not Naomi 's land that he wanted . " I will think it over , " said  | Tobias ; and rode away from Naomi to ride beside his daughter Reba , to counsel her to go and ride with Ruth and thus to draw the eyes of Boaz upon herself . In all that throng only Tobias was troubled . Disgruntled Gibbor , who in the presence of Boaz could only look with silent longing at the . loveliness of Ruth , diverted himself with calling bold pleasantries to the other maidens . And even Zvuv , that angry man of God , who loped back and forth among the multitude on a bony but garlanded mule , busily examining the offerings of each of the pilgrims , stopped to join in the singing of the young men riding with Ruth : What aileth thee , O sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turnest back ? Ye mountains , that ye skip like rams ; Ye little hills , like lambs ? Tremble , thou earth , at the presence of the Lord , At the presence of the God of Jacob ; Which turned the rock into a pool of water , The flint into a fountain . Then Zvuv went to ride alongside Tobias and chided him for having brought a blemished he-goat as his offering to the sacrifice of firstling lambs and bullocks and rams . " If it were an offering to a prince of Ammon who might buy your iron and brass , Tobias , you would not give him that lame and scurvy creature , " said Zvuv . " And surely the Lord God of Israel should have the best of your flocks , perfect males without blemish , especially as your he-goat is for a sin offering , and you have much to answer for , " said Zvuv . But troubled Tobias only looked down with scornful  | impatience upon Zvuv ; and Zvuv said : " The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proceeds of wickedness ; " and he left Tobias to return hastily to the young men clustered about Ruth and Reba and the other maidens , whose mothers had also sent them to ride with Ruth . For the young men were singing lustily : Come , my beloved , let us go forth into the field ; Let us lodge in the villages . Let us rise up early to the vineyards ; Let us see if the vine hath budded , And the tender grape appeared , And the pomegranate be in flower : There will I give thee my love . The mandrakes give forth fragrance , And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits , New and old , Which I have laid up for thee , O my beloved . And when the young men had ended this song Zvuv raised his voice and admonished them saying : " O sons of Israel , it is indeed said in the Book of Remembrance that at the Feast of Weeks thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God . But that ancient song you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh of woman which is intended only for the fruitfulness of all mankind ; it celebrates the love of the Lord God of Israel for his chosen people to whom he said in Egypt : Come , my beloved , let us go forth . . . " And though the young men laughed unbelieving at this , Zvuv continued : " Then were you betrothed to the Lord ; and at Sinai , where he made his covenant with you , were you married to him . And it is his laws and commandments which in your song are the precious  | fruits , new and old , which the Lord laid up for you , his beloved , at Sinai . And each year on the Passover do you celebrate your betrothal to the One God Almighty , and now at the Feast of Weeks do you go to celebrate your marriage to him and the harvest this marriage has given you . For the Lord God of Israel is wedded to none other than his people . Unlike other gods , unlike Baal-Peor who is married to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naomi who had urged her donkey through the throng until it rode close beside Yohfe raised up her voice and said to Boaz : " It would appear that Zvuv envies the Lord God of Israel because he has no wife . " Boaz turned his grave gray eyes to Naomi and smiled upon her and said : " Any man who has suffered like Zvuv at the mouth of a carping contentious woman has reason to envy the freedom of the Almighty who has no wife . " And Naomi said : " It is not for mere man to envy the freedom of Almighty God , who in his infinite wisdom saw fit to give Eve unto Adam . And though God told Adam that a man shall leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife , yet men when marriage hampers them will blame not God but women for the loss of their freedom . True it is that women want marriage so that they may bear and raise in peace the children men give them . But men need marriage too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women with others , except in harlotry , and because they want sons of their own loins for their help and inheritance . Thus men , who are ever divided in spirit , both fear and desire marriage , which while it robs them of some freedom does greatly enrich them . " And Boaz said , " But what if a man values his freedom more than the enrichment which marriage brings ? "  | " Then he is no man , " said Naomi , " even though he be potent among women as a ram among ewes . For though freedom is a fine thing , he shows himself still a child who wants freedom from the consequences of his own desires , he is but a child who wants to take his fill of what is sweet , without restraint and without care for what comes of his doing . " " Yet , " said Boaz , " though the Lord our God saw fit to give Adam a wife and has told us to be fruitful and multiply and has commanded us concerning everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that every man must marry . " " True , " said Naomi , " but the Lord loves a bridegroom ; for did he not say to Moses : When a man takes a wife he shall not go out with the armed host , nor shall he be charged with any business : he shall be free at home one year and shall cheer the wife he has taken . " " And like the Lord , " said Boaz , smiling upon her , " you , too , love a bridegroom , Naomi . " " Indeed , " said Naomi , " I do . For I believe as the old saying goes , that : Whoso findeth a wife findeth great good and obtaineth the favor of the Lord . But mind you  --  it must be a good wife . All marriages need not be like the marriage of poor Zvuv . For , as the old saying goes further , happy is the husband of a good wife ; the number of his days shall be twofold . " And she turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave gray eyes of Boaz followed the eyes of Naomi to where Ruth rode ahead of them , radiant in beauty and happy in the homage which the young men paid to her beauty , for they said she was more beautiful even than the maidens of Shiloh who were famous for their beauty in all Israel . And Naomi returned her eyes to  | the thoughtful face of Boaz and said softly : " There is also an old saying , Boaz : Better is open rebuke than love that is hidden . " And Boaz , with his eyes still fixed upon Ruth was about to answer Naomi , when Elias rode his white mare between them , saying to Boaz : " We are told that Moses said : Three times in the year shall thy males appear before the Lord : in the feast of unleavened bread , and in this feast of weeks , and in the feast of tabernacles in the fall . Why then do the women also come on these pilgrimages to the tabernacle ? " And Naomi was very angry with Elias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fixed his thoughts upon Ruth . And she shouted up at Elias : " We are told that the Lord God of Israel made his covenant in the wilderness with all the children of Israel , the men and the women and even the little ones . And when Moses instructed the children of Israel to build the tabernacle , the sanctuary of the Lord God of Israel , they came , both men and women , as many as were willing hearted and brought brooches and earrings and fringe rings and armlets of gold . . . And we are told , " said Naomi , " that all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands and brought what they had spun , the blue and the purple , the scarlet and the fine linen . And all the women whose hearts stirred them up in wisdom spun the goat 's hair ... And we are told , " said Naomi , " that the children of Israel brought freewill offerings unto the Lord ; every man and woman , whose heart made them willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded to be made by the hands of Moses . And that , " said Naomi , " is why the women go along with the men to the sanctuary of the Lord God of Israel . " And with that she turned her donkey and rode away from Elias and Boaz.  | And Boaz rebuked Elias for having offended the old woman in questioning the right of the women to go to the tabernacle they had helped to build . " But , " said Elias , " they make our dangerous journey to Shiloh still more difficult and dangerous . See there , " and he pointed to the walls of Jerusalem which they were approaching , " see the Jebusites waiting on their walls to molest us while we pass by on the road beneath them . " And Boaz told Elias to sound an alarum on his ram 's horn . And when the throng had come to a halt , Boaz ordered that all the women , the old men and the young lads move to the eastern side of the road so that the fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they passed by the walls of Jerusalem ; and he told the men to have ready to hand the weapons they carried concealed among the baskets of grain  --  the archers their bows and arrows and the others their clubs and spears and swords . And left-handed Gibbor , drawing the knife from his right thigh shouted , " Let them cast but one stone upon us and we will stop and take the city from them ! We have waited long enough since Joshua brought our fathers into this promised land which is not yet ours ! " And young Joel piped up as he swung his sling : " Let us drive them out now ! " But Boaz silenced them saying : " You speak like witless children . If we have not yet won all this land which the Lord God of Israel promised our fathers it is because of our backsliding . " And he sent young Joel back among the women and commanded the men that there be no show of arms or threat to the Jebusites except if they attacked the pilgrims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Boaz , " and this is not a journey for conquest but for  | peaceful thanksgiving to the Lord . " Then he went to the standard bearer and took the flag of the lion of Judah and rode ahead on Yohfe his stallion . And so the throng went on toward Jerusalem , the women and the weak guarded by the men . And as they came near to the city they heard the sounds of celebration on the high place just within the wall  --  the seductive songs and the drunken shouts of the revelers and the dreadful wailing of their first-born under the sacrificial knife ... . And the Jebusites perched on the great wall of their city did not molest the Israelites as they passed but they called down to them saying : " Why do you go up to Shiloh  --  to worship an unknown God ? " " Turn aside here and sacrifice with us to Baal on our high place . " " We have warm-blooded babes more precious to the gods than any Iamb or ram . " " Bring your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them fertile . " " Come roast your fatlings on our fires and eat and drink and lie with us before Baal and Ashtar who will repay you a hundredfold for your sacrifices .... " But none among the Israelites answered them as they went by . Only the shrill voice of Zvuv was heard as he rode between the men and the women exhorting them : " Remember what befell the children of Israel when Israel abode in Shittim . And the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab ; for they called the people unto the sacrifice of their gods ; and the people did eat and bowed down to their gods . And Israel joined himself unto Baal-Peor : and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel . And the Lord said unto Moses , Take all the chiefs of the people , and hang them up before the sun , that the  | fierce anger of the Lord may turn away from Israel . And Moses said unto the judges of Israel , Slay ye every one his men that have joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israelites raised his weapon , even Gibbor withheld his hidden sword ; only young Joel could not resist raising his sling and sending a small stone clattering against the great wall of Jerusalem . And after they had ridden by the city of the Jebusites without mishap the men no longer rode to one side guarding the women but mingled with them again and the young men resumed their singing ; but they did not gather again about Ruth because they remembered that she was a daughter of Moab their enemy . Ruth rode thereafter only with Naomi . And as the Israelites rode northward beyond Jerusalem into the land of Benjamin , Zvuv , sitting backwards upon his bony beast so as to face the people as he rode , raised up his voice again and said : " Hear me now , fathers and mothers of Bethlehem who have daughters , lest you be moved to give them in marriage to the men of Benjamin . Hear now the tale which is told in our Book of Remembrance and which has to do with a journey along this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... " Then Naomi said to Ruth : " That is a long story . " And she took out her spinning whorl and wool and spun a thread as they rode . And those within earshot heard as they rode the harsh voice of Zvuv rising and falling on the sunny breeze : And it came to pass . . . that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehem in Judah . And Ruth asked Naomi : " Who are these Levites ? "  | Naomi said : " They are the tribe of priests of Israel who have no single dwelling place in the land . " And Ruth listened again to Zvuv : And his concubine played the harlot and went away from him to her father 's house in Bethlehem and was there for the space of four months . Naomi said : " Now is it likely that she would have gone to her father 's house had she played the harlot ? " And Ruth said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further to Zvuv : And her husband arose , and went after her to speak kindly unto her , to bring her back , taking his servant with him and a couple of asses .. . And Ruth said : " He would appear to have been a saintly man , this Levite , patient and kind . " Naomi said : " That remains to be seen . " And she brought him into her father 's house .. . And Naomi said : " A woman will surely not withhold forgiveness from a man who goes after her . " And Ruth said : " But was it not he who forgave her ? " And when the father of the woman saw him he rejoiced .. . Ruth said : " Nothing seems to make a father happier than getting rid of a daughter . " And Naomi said : " Nothing but getting rid of two daughters , as Laban did when he tricked Jacob into taking both Leah and Rachel . " And they heard the harsh voice of Zvuv blown about by the breeze : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the man rose up to depart , he and his concubine and his servant , his father-in-law said unto him , Behold now the day groweth toward evening ; I pray you tarry the night .. . Ruth said : " My father , also , little as he loved Mahlon ,  | an Israelite , was yet pleased or perhaps relieved when Mahlon came to take me in marriage . " And tomorrow get you early on your way .. . And Naomi said : " I remember well how timidly poor Mahlon approached him and how eagerly his gifts were received . " But the man would not tarry that night , but he rose up and departed .. . Naomi said : " You see now that this Levite was an impatient man , accustomed to having his way as many men are . " But Ruth said nothing more , and listened to the voice of Zvuv : When they were by Jebus , which is Jerusalem , the day was far spent ; and the servant said to his master , Come , I pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jebusites and lodge in it . And his master said to him , We will not turn aside into the city of a stranger , that is not of the children of Israel ; but we will pass over to Gibeah ... . And Naomi said : " As it turned out he might better have stayed with the Jebusites . " So they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin . And they turned aside there to lodge in Gibeah ; and he sat down in the street of the city ; for there was no man took them into his house to lodge . And , behold , there came an old man from his work , out of the field at evening . And this man was of the hill country of Ephraim and he sojourned in Gibeah .. . Naomi said : " Since this is a good old man he can not of course have been of the tribe of Benjamin , which is in ill repute to this day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goest thou ? and whence comest thou ? And the wayfarer said to him , We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the farther side  | of the hill country of Ephraim , from thence am I. . . . And the old man said , Peace be unto thee ; let all thy wants lie upon me ; lodge not in the street . So he brought him into his house , and gave the asses fodder ; and they washed their feet and did eat and drink . As they were making their hearts merry , behold , the men of the city , certain sons of Belial , beset the house round about , beating at the door ; and they shake to the master of the house , the old man , saying , Bring forth the man that came into thine house , that we may know him carnally . And the master of the house went out to them and said to them , nay , my brethren , I pray you , do not so wickedly , this man is come into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my daughter , a maiden , and his concubine , them will I bring out .. . Naomi said : " See now how generous with their women kindly old men can be , and even a saintly Levite . " And Ruth said : " It would not appear from this tale that the men of Israel are indeed any better than the men of Moab  --  as thou wast wont to tell me , Naomi . " ... So the man laid hold on his concubine and brought her forth to them ; and they knew her and abused her all the night until the morning ; and when the day began to spring they let her go . Then came the woman in the dawning of the day , and fell down at the door of the house .. . Naomi looked up from her spinning and saw that the dark eyes of Ruth were filled with dismay , and Naomi said gently : " You should know , my daughter , that even in Israel there have been and there are yet men unto whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And in the hearts of some the spirit of the Lord still wrestles with the spirit of Belial. " ... till it was light . And her husband rose up in the morning and opened the door . . .  | " Having left her all night in the hands of those beastly men , " Naomi added bitterly . ... and behold , the woman , his concubine , was fallen down at the door of the house with her hands upon the threshold . And he said to her , Up and let us be going ; but none answered . Then he took her up .. . And Naomi said : " The best that can be said for him is that he did not abandon her when she had died . " ... and the man went up unto his place . And when he was come to his house he took a knife and laid hold on his concubine and divided her , limb by limb , into twelve pieces , and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel ... Naomi said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done her , now he was impatient to avenge her . It is a pity that men are not as eager to avert harm as to avenge it . " Then all the children of Israel went out , and the congregation was assembled as one man , from Dan even to Beersheba , with the land of Gilead , unto the Lord at Mizpah ... . And Naomi said : " Now is it not strange that brothers who will not unite for peace can become as one man for war ? " ... four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword .. . Ruth said : " And that against their own brothers ! " And Naomi said : " And is it not strange that this mighty army has assembled but once to fight their common enemy , and that was when Deborah a woman called them . The Lord God of Israel has called his people a peculiar treasure . And though it is sometimes difficult to see what he treasures in them they are indeed peculiar . " And the children of Israel said , Tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the Levite , the husband of the woman that was murdered answered and said , I came into Gibeah in the land of Benjamin , I and my concubine , to lodge . And the men of Gibeah rose against me ... And Naomi said : " Observe now the spirit of man : he takes up arms first and then asks the cause . " . . . and my concubine they forced and she is dead . And I took my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel , for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel ... . And Ruth said : " And yet , this horror of lewdness in Israel , which I first saw in Mahlon and never in the men of Moab , is indeed a peculiar treasure which women should prize . " And all the people rose as one man saying .. . And Ruth said : " But it is a pity that these men need be as fierce in their righteousness as those in their lewdness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Gibeah , we will go up against it by lot ; and we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel , and an hundred of a thousand , and a thousand out of ten thousand .. . And Ruth said : " And is it not wonderful that with no king to command them and to force them to do this , yet the men of Israel could rise up as one man and say what they all willed to do ! " Naomi said : " The children of Israel are indeed fearful and wonderful . " So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city , knit together , as one man . And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin , saying , What  | wickedness is this that is come to pass among you ? Now therefore deliver up the men , the sons of Belial , which are in Gibeah , that we may put them to death , and put away evil from Israel . But Benjamin would not hearken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel . And Ruth said to Naomi : " But were they not all the children of Israel ? It is a dreadful thing that brothers should turn upon each other in hatred . " Naomi said : " Though they were all the sons of one father , they were not of one mother : Benjamin , like Joseph , was born of beloved Rachel , while the others were the sons of Leah and Bilhah and Zilpah whom Jacob the father of all Israel did not love as he had loved Rachel . And as the brothers of Joseph turned upon him and sold him into slavery in Egypt so have the sons of the brothers of Benjamin turned upon his sons . Even the sons of one mother often do not love one another . My Mahlon and Chilion though they had one mother and father were too unlike to love one another . Chilion despised and envied Mahlon for his frailty and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despised Chilion for his strength and lustfulness . " And Ruth looked upon Boaz bearing the flag of the lion of Judah , and riding ahead of the throng on Yohfe with Elias on his right hand and Gibbor on his left , and Ruth said : " Had I two sons I would strive to make them both to be like unto their father and then they would be like unto each other and would love one another . " And envisioning what she had said Ruth ceased listening a while to the voice of Zvuv :  | And the children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword , besides the inhabitants of Gibeah , which were numbered seven hundred chosen men lefthanded ; every one could sling stones at an hairbreadth , and not miss .. . And young Joel , who had left his aunt Reba and his grandfather Tobias to ride behind Boaz , raised his small voice and cried : " And I too can sling a stone at a hairbreadth , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sling . And Boaz asked where had he got it , and the boy told him how Ruth the Moabitess had made it for him and had taught him to use it ; and Joel said : " For she wished that she had a son just like me whom she might teach to fight the enemies of Israel when they come to molest us . " Boaz said : " Did she indeed ? " And he looked to where Ruth was riding nearby with Naomi . And Joel said to Boaz : " I wish that I had been among those who fought the Benjamites ! " And Boaz said gently : " Had I a son just like you , Joel , I would teach him not to wish for war with his brothers . " Nevertheless the lad listened eagerly to the tale Zvuv was telling : And the children of Israel arose and went up to Bethel and asked counsel of God ; and they said , Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin ? And the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of Israel rose up in the morning and encamped against Gibeah . And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin .. . Then Joel said boastfully : " Being a son of Judah I should have been one of the first to go against Benjamin . "  | And Gibbor the Benjamite who sat upon the burdened camel beside Boaz , listening unhappily to the story , scowled at the lad . And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah and destroyed down to the ground on that day twenty and two thousand men of Israel ... . And Gibbor turned to the boy saying : " Now do you wish you were there ? " And Joel , chagrined , did not answer him . And the children of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until evening ; and they asked of the Lord , saying , Shall I draw nigh to battle against the children of Benjamin , my brethren ? And the Lord said go up against him . And the children of Israel came near against the children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out of Gibeah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground again eighteen thousand men of Israel ... Then Gibbor turned again to the unhappy boy saying : " Now do you wish you were there ? Even the Lord did not help them . " And Boaz rebuked Gibbor saying : " Do not plague the lad . Had I a son like him I would wish he need never know such warfare ; but who knows when Israel shall live in lasting peace , though we pray for peace and greet each other with ' Peace . ' " And to Joel he said : " Listen now to Zvuv and see what will happen . You will learn that the Lord does what is right , but in his own time . " Then all the children of Israel , and all the people , went up and came to Bethel and wept and sat there before the Lord , for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days , and Phineas , the son of Eleazar , the son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children of  | Israel asked of the Lord , saying , Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother , or shall I cease ? And the Lord said , Go up ; for tomorrow I shall deliver him into your hand . And Israel set Tiers in wait round about Gibeah . And Naomi said to Ruth : " Now you shall hear of the trick my wise Elimelech devised to overcome the Benjamites . " And Ruth said : " But if the Lord God of Israel had promised them victory why need they have devised a trick to accomplish it ? " Naomi said : " That is a question I can not answer . All I can tell you is that the Lord makes nothing easy for man , even for his chosen people . Though he parted the Red Sea for them , he first hardened the heart of Pharaoh ten times to prevent their departure from Egypt . In six days the Lord created the earth and all that is in it ; but he makes us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from the womb . " And Ruth , looking to where Boaz spoke with the boy Joel riding beside him , said : " Indeed the Lord does not make it easy for us women to bring to pass what we want . " And she sighed as she listened again to Zvuv : And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and set themselves in array against Gibeah as at the other times . And the children of Benjamin went out against them and were drawn away from the city ; and they began to smite and kill . . . And Joel said anxiously : " Did not the Lord come to their help ? " But the children of Israel said , Let us flee and draw them away from the city into the highways . . . . And Boaz said to Joel : " Listen my lad , and you will  | learn . But pray God that you never need use this knowledge . " ... because they trusted unto the Tiers in wait which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait hastened and rushed upon Gibeah .. . And Joel exulted : " That was clever of them was it not , Boaz ? If I were there I would be first among the Tiers in wait . " . . . and smote all the city at the edge of the sword . Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the Tiers in wait was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city . And the men of Israel turned in the battle .. . And Gibbor said sourly : " It was only through guile , not by their strength that they won . " ... and the Benjamites looked behind them and , behold , the whole of the city went up in a pillar of smoke to heaven . And they turned their backs before the men of Israel and fled unto the way of the wilderness ; but the battle followed hard after them .. . And Joel cried to Gibbor : " Then why did you not turn upon us if you were so strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Israel ; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty and five thousand .. . Gibbor said contemptuously : " They could not have done it but for the help of the Lord . " . . . the entire city and the cattle and all that they found .. . And again young Joel said enviously : " I wish that I had been there ! " ... and the men of Israel swore at Mizpah saying , There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife ....  | " And all for the sake of a single woman ! " grumbled Gibbor as Zvuv ended the story . Nevertheless when the men and women of Judah came to the gates of Gibeah in Benjamin , which was the home of Gibbor , many Benjamites , headed by their standard bearing the wolf of Benjamin , came out to join the pilgrims from Judah . They were mostly men , there being a great lack of women among the Benjamites , and the young men among them , strong and lusty like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the fathers of the maidens rode close behind their daughters and dissuaded the ardent young men , reminding them of the oath their fathers had taken . But when some young Benjamites , drawn by the beauty of Ruth , clustered about her singing her praises Naomi did not dissuade them because she saw from afar the fire of jealousy they kindled in the grave gray eyes of Boaz . And so the pilgrims rode northward out of Benjamin up into the hill country of Ephraim , Joseph 's younger son ? he whom old Jacob , dying in Egypt , had placed before Manasseh his elder brother when he blessed them both . And the land of Ephraim was a beautiful land with streams gushing forth from the rocks , watering the gardens and vineyards on the hillsides , and with forests of oak and yew on the uplands whence through the clear sunny air the pilgrims could see the snowy heads of Mount Hermon and Lebanon high in the sky like white clouds far to the north . So they went past Ramah and Ai to Bethel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beasts in a field in which stood a pillar of stone . And there was an ancient oak and under it an old tomb which was said to be Deborah 's grave . And eastward on a mountain they could see the altar which Abraham set up when he first came  | into Canaan . And there in the field they were joined by Ephraimite pilgrims headed by their standard bearing the fruitful bough of Joseph their father . And some of the Benjamites , uncouth young men like Gibbor , soiled the field wherein the pilgrims were resting , by leaving their excrement exposed upon it ; and Zvuv fell upon these men , angrily berating them for their uncleanness , reminding them how Moses had ordered the children of Israel in the desert to carry about them paddles of wood with which to cover their excrement , saying : For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp . Then Zvuv , mounting upon a hillock by the pillar of stone that stood in the field , told how Jacob the father of all Israel had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba and went toward Haran . And he lighted upon a certain place , and tarried there all night , because the sun was set ; and he took one of the stones of the place , and put it under his head , and lay down in that place to sleep . And he dreamed , and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven . And behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it . Then Ruth said to Naomi : " You would think that what the Lord God had done at the tower of Babel would have stopped men from trying even in dreams to reach up into heaven . " And Naomi said : " There is no stopping those dreamers . " Zvuv said : And behold the Lord stood above it and said , I am the Lord , the God of Abraham , thy father , and the God of Isaac : the land whereon thou liest , to thee will I give it , and to thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth , and thou shalt spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south ; and in thee 176  | and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blest . And , behold , I am with thee , and will keep thee wherever thou goest , and will bring thee again into this land ; for I will not leave thee , until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of . And Elias said to Boaz : " It is long since that promise was made us , yet we are still but a handful here in the midst of many enemies who do not look upon us and our God as a blessing ; and we go up to the Lord our God bearing arms lest the other families of the earth destroy us on the way . " And Zvuv said : And Jacob awaked out of his sleep , and he said , Surely the Lord is in this place ; and I knew it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearful is this place ! This is none other than the house of God , and this is the gate of heaven . And Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil upon the top of it . And he called the name of that place Bethel ... . And Gibbor said to Boaz : " Our father Jacob must have been a lusty fellow seeing that he went and got himself four wives in Haran and begot twelve sons and a daughter after setting up here a dripping pillar to God as do the peoples of Canaan to this day , which we the children of Israel are now forbidden to do . And he must have been a shrewd fellow , for did he not here make a bargain with God , offering a tithe if the Lord brought him back to his father 's house ? " Boaz said : " That was long , long ago before Moses brought us up out of Egypt and brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Almighty . " " And now , " said Zvuv , " the house of the Lord God of  | Israel is at Shiloh as our father Jacob foretold it would be in his blessing of Judah . And this day do we go up to Shiloh with our offerings to the Lord , not as do other peoples to bribe their greedy gods , but to give thanks to the one God whose will is unchanging and whose laws we come there to learn and to heed . And he that turns away his ear from hearing the law , even his prayer is an abomination to the Lord who wants no bribe from his people Israel . Nor does the Lord lust like the gods of other peoples for the blood of his children and the lewdness of his sons and daughters . In witness whereof he sent to our father Abraham a scapegoat to sacrifice for his son , Isaac , and he destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah for their lewdness . And though we go now to offer the first of our harvests to the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Israel in this harvest season to increase the fruitfulness of the women of Israel in marriage , do not let such lustful thoughts entice you to the abominations of the Jebusites , the Ammonites , and the Moabites . Far different from the rites of spring on the heathen high places is our celebration of this the Feast of Weeks at Shiloh .... " And indeed it was different from the spring rites in Moab , as Ruth saw when they arrived in Shiloh at nightfall and joined the multitude which had come from the tribes to the north and from eastward across Jordan . For the women were separated from the men and encamped apart from them for the night on a hillside above the place before the court of the tabernacle where the host of men were encamped around the standards of their tribes , around the lion of Judah , the wolf of Benjamin , the fruitful  | bough of Ephraim and Manasseh the two sons of Joseph , the strong crouching ass of Issachar , the ship of Zebulon , the hind of Naphthali from beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan from far to the north by snowy Mount Hermon . And the men of Israel did not carouse in the night but busied themselves bringing their offerings of beasts and of grain to the entrance of the forecourt of the tabernacle which was dark now but for the light of the eternal lamp within it and the smouldering fire upon the altar before it in readiness for the sacrifices on the morrow . And as Ruth and Naomi lay down to rest among the women on the hill Ruth said : " It seems strange that the men of Israel set their women apart from them when they assemble before their God . It would seem from this that they think not more but less of their women than do the men of Moab  --  that they consider us creatures unworthy of the attention of the Lord . " Naomi said : " It may seem so , my daughter ; but it is because they well know the power of women to rouse their passions that they place us apart from them before the Lord ; it is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to turn to the abominations of the high places . It is not women they think the less of but their own lustfulness . Sleep now , my daughter , and you will see in the morning how different are these men of Israel before their God from the men before the gods of Moab . " And indeed Ruth saw that it was so when she was awakened at dawn by the shrill sweet blasts of silver trumpets and she rose up and went to stand with Naomi among the garlanded women gathered upon the flowery hillside singing together as the sun slowly rose :
