Ever since it was cited by the U.S. Post Office last month for naughtiness ( mostly because of its lithe , leggy , lightly clad " Varga Girl " drawings ) , the magazine Esquire has been crusading zealously in its own behalf . In a series of advertisements in newspapers and trade magazines it had been preparing for its Oct. 19 hearing ( at which postal examiners will determine Esquire 's right to continue to use second-class mail ) by back-patting itself as a soldier-sailor morale builder . <P> The first ads were calmly logical , only slightly pouty . One mentioned " the galaxy of pinups and other divertissements demanded by the armed forces . " Another : " Soldiers and sailors have been writing us . . . telling us what store they set by their precious copies of this much-thumbed and well-regarded magazine . " A third was eloquent about " the boys " who want " pleasant things to think of , and to look at . ... They want to think of girls and gaiety and good times . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant , soft and gentle aspects of the life they 've left behind . . . . " <P> Last week , apparently playing its ace . Esquire enlisted the clergy 's aid . With elaborate piety the latest Esquire ad features a picture of a Guadalcanal chaplain , the Cross of Christ on his collar , rays of holy light slanting across his fighting face . <P> Its title ( " if Holy Joe can go out there , who are we to be holding back ? " ) seemed to be addressed to the U.S. Post Office itself . Said the ad 's text : " Chaplains have . . . acquired a new breadth of both understanding and tolerance from their daily contacts with men in the armed forces . . . . That 's what we have sensed from the letters we have had from chaplains telling us of the tremendous morale-value of copies of Esquire . . . . "
