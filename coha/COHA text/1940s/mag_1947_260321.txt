From the Interstate Commerce Commission last week came prime good news for West Coast industrialists . Beginning April i , a 31% reduction in freight rates will go into effect on steel shipped from U.S. Steel 's Geneva ( Utah ) plant . This would reduce steel prices about $4.40 a ton for West Coast customers ( TIME , March 10 ) . Cried the jubilant Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce : " The decision . . . establishes the new Western steel price economy for which we have fought so long and hard . " <P> The new economy might have come a month earlier except for the anguished cries of Henry J. Kaiser ( TIME , March 10 ) for a freight cut for his Fontana steel plant . This had held up the Geneva reduction . As ICC said that it would continue to study Western freight rates , Westerners guessed that Henry Kaiser might soon get his reduction , too .
