In dealing with proposals to abolish or restrict capital punishment , the Labor government has looked like a comedian tangled up in flypaper . The House of Lords and the plain people ( 69% of them , according to an opinion poll ) want hanging kept as the penalty for murder . A majority in the Laborite House of Commons wants it abolished . <P> The Lords rejected one House of Commons scheme abolishing the noose for five years ( TIME , June 14 ) . So , last fortnight , the House of Commons proposed a " compromise " amendment . It divided murder into two categories , the first punishable by hanging , the second by life imprisonment . <P> But instead of a simple distinction between premeditation and impulse , the amendment set up some more subtle definitions . It was first-degree murder if connected with robbery , burglary , rape , sex offenses , the death of a policeman or prison guard , the use of explosives . Repeated use of a slow poison , such as arsenic , would be a capital offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be only second-degree murder . <P> Winston Churchill , a sturdy monogamist himself , pointed out the loopholes to prospective wife-killers . If you are anxious to avoid hanging , he said , " you can strangle her , hold her head in a gas oven . . . stab her , cut her throat or bash her brains out . If you can arrange a procedure , you can set her on fire , push her off a station platform in front of an oncoming train , push her through the porthole of a ship , or , more easily , you can drown her in the bathtub . " <P> Nevertheless the House of Commons doggedly passed the monstrosity . When it reached the House of Lords , Labor 's Lord Chancellor Viscount Jowitt confessed that " this compromise has not the justification of logic behind it . " The Lords scornfully rejected the amendment , and the government gave up . The noose 's place in British justice will be unchanged .                @ @ @ @ @
