txt Since the presentation of the drastic Treasury tax plan , sentiment is reported to be growing in Congress , in spite of Treasury opposition , in favor of a general sales tax . This is not surprising . Most students of the subject agree that the present corporation taxes and in- , come taxes in the higher brackets are already close to the point of maximum productivity or the point where they would be excessively disruptive to the national economy . Among the very few important sources of revenue that remain are a general sales tax and higher excise taxes . The raising of the rates of excise tax and the increase in the commodities subject to it , that the Treasury now proposes , seems in itself to move halfway toward a general sales tax . The Administration has hitherto actively opposed a general sales tax . Its argument has been that this would place proportionately as great a burden on the consumption of the lower as of the higher income classes . But this is to talk as if the proposed sales tax would exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed . But we already have the most drastic progressive income tax on record . When we think of a general sales tax , as we must , as merely one part of the over-all tax structure that would result after its enactment , the force of the Administration 's objection disappears . For the total burden of taxation would still be very highly progressive on the larger incomes . The Administration 's objections could be to a large extent met even within the sales tax itself . There is no reason why a sales tax can not itself be graduated or progressive . In addition to a flat tax on all commodities ( equivalent to the " normal " income tax ) , we could retain whatever excise taxes we wished on special luxury or semi-luxury goods ( which would be equivalent to the income surtax ) . There would be many advantages in this and no objections to it , as long as the total tax on any particular commodity could be justified . Congress could even , if it desired , work out a system of exemptions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past have usually been so great as to threaten the revenue productiveness of the general sales tax . It is often said , for example , that we should exempt all foodstuffs . But many foodstuffs are themselves semi-luxuries . If we are to make selections , there would doubtless be wide disagreement concerning which foods were semiluxuries and which were not . Our own Government a little while ago was planning to .. ubsidize coffee , on the theory that it was quite essential . But the British , even in peacetimes , have long had substantial taxes on tea , coffee , cocoa , sugar and other breakfast or dinner-table items . For some strange reason , also , ou own Government , while now subsidizing butter , taxes oleomargarine , which has a similar nutritional value and sells at half the price . But there is another possible way out of this difficulty than exemption of all foodstuffs or a selected list of " essential " foods . A. general sales tax could be imposed without exemptions ; but the Government could issue to each person stamps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be sufficient to cover that person 's minimum subsistence needs . Let us say , for example , that these minimum subsistence food needs were determined to be $650 a year for a family of four , or , say , $250 for each adult . Each person would receive tax stamps to pay the equivalent of the tax on this amount of foodstuffs . Persons on a merely adequate low-cost diet would in such a case pay no taxes at all . But persons on a richer diet , or living at a higher level , would use up their tax stamps in a certain number of months , depending on the level at which they lived , and would thereafter pay taxes on everything they bought . Such a plan would , of course , involve administrative complications like the present point-rationing system . But it would meet in principle one of the most frequent objections to a general sales tax ; and it would enable such a tax to be imposed at a higher rate than otherwise . We must never forget , as the doctrinaire opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alternatives to I a general sales tax which would really reach mass income is inflation . Since the outbreak of the present war in September , 1939 , the American cost of living has increased about 25 per cent . While the Administration has objected to a general sales tax of 10 per cent , of 5 per cent or even of 2 per cent , this rise in the cost of living is the equivalent of a sales tax of more than 25 per cent on every family in the country . Yet though every family in the country is paying this sales tax , the proceeds are not going to the Government . They are going to those persons and groups , whether employers or workers , whose incomes have been increased out of the war at the expense of those whose incomes have not . * What would be the difference between a general sales tax , with these modifications , and a further increase in the normal income tax ? One difference would be that the coverage would be immensely wider . It would reach every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach an incalculable number of persons who , through carelessness or evasion , and because their incomes are difficult for the Government accurately to determine or to trace , are not now paying their fair share of income tax . But a sales tax would have an additional advantage as compared with an income tax . It would be possible for each individual , by the nature and volume of his own expenditures , to control to some extent what his tax would be . The less he spent on luxuries , the less he spent on himself , the more he saved , the smaller his tax . Thus every family in the country would hate a direct incentive for economy , a direct incentive for not buying scarce goods and for avoiding inflationary expenditures , a direct incentive , indeed , for investing instead in war bonds . There has already been a serious and irrecoverable loss of time in imposing a general sales tax . Too drastic a rate at the start , before administrative difficulties were ironed out and before business had a chance to adjust itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more regrettable that a moderate general sales tax was not put into effect at the very outbreak of the war . There should be no further needless delay .
