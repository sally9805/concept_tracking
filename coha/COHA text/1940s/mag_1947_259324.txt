From iron-grey clouds a bitterly cold rain fell on 5,324 athletes from six nations . The Communist daily L'Humanite had invited them to Paris ' Le Tremblay race track to spread international good will ( and Communist Party publicity ) . The good will had failed to materialize . <P> Sports editors from rival papers kicked because , they said , L'Humanite approved the entry only of French athletes of the proper pink political complexion . At the field itself 10,006 soggy sports fans , who had paid 10 francs each , groused at the political speeches . There was nothing about the races themselves to cheer them up . In the five-kilometer event , half of the huge starting field of 600 dropped out before the end . Many of those remaining were a full lap behind . At the finish : 100 runners crossed the line in such an inextricable melee that nobody could tell who won . <P> The big event of the day was a 2,500-meter race for " women aces , " featuring 40 French entries and seven Russians . The Russian entries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rangy ( like Champion Irene Zaitseva ) , and those built like truck drivers ( two of them were , in fact , truck drivers ) . <P> Before the race , the Russians had been briefed on the peculiar French starting technique . Because undisciplined French athletes can not be made to line up quietly , the ideal French starter is one who can surprise his runners while they are all bending down to tie shoelaces . The pudgy little starter at Le Tremblay last week was one of the best . Casually , as great globules of water dripped from his mustache , he engaged the girls in a long , rambling conversation about the weather . <P> They 're Off ! Suddenly , in the midst of it , he fired his gun . The seven Russians stared blankly as the French girls scooted down the track . Then the Russians caught on . Their faces set in stern concentration , their legs pumping like pistons in a Magnitogorsk factory , they charged down the track , past the limp bunting on the grandstand , past the mudstreaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> At 300 meters , neither slackening nor quickening their punishing pace , they passed the mesdemoiselles . Some nine minutes later in regimented single file , with Champion Zaitseva in the lead , all seven crossed the finish line , 50 yards ahead of the first Frenchwoman . Six other French girls had quit cold in the first 1,000 meters . " The Russians were too formidable , " said one . " Anyway it was too wet and I wanted to get home . " <P> As a wag set off the siren which means foul in horse racing , even L'Humanite 's editors seemed to think the Russian sweep had been rather too much of a good thing . But in their shoddy , Left-Bank hotel , the Russian ladies explained it : " The French women do not plan . We won because we work and plan . "
