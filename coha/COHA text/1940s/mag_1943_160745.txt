" . . . Unspeakable design . . . horrible example . . . palm-leaf bauble . . . witless bit of trash . . . . " <P> With these and other explosions , Art Critic Edward Alden Jewell last week blew up in the New York Times . He was writing about a proposed temporary Victory Arch for Manhattan 's Times Square , to be erected when the boys come marching home . The scheme , sponsored by the Broadway Association , was described by its backers as " an arch fashioned to represent two huge palm leaves which are emblematic of Victory . . . . At the apex of the main motif will be placed the figures of Peace and Justice . The finger of Peace will point in the direction of Europe and Asia . Justice , displaying her broken sword , will be shown facing the Americas . " <P> Designer of the arch was Lucia Helene Willoughby , a portrait painter and 23-year-old daughter of Broadway Committee Chairman P. A. Willoughby . Said the Broadway Association of her effort : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several modifications of the original theme as developed by Norman Rockwell TIME , June 21 . . . . Freedom of Speech . . . will show separate scenes . . . . Freedom from Want has been designated for the west panel . Here is portrayed Cornucopia pouring out its bounteous contents . . . . The fourth panel . . . will delineate Freedom from Fear . The ever-protecting element of mother love will be indicated by a mother holding her child in her arms . The carefree yet rhythmic motions of the nature dancer complete the theme for this panel . " <P> Once Critic Jewell let go , he found it hard to control himself . Said he : " Since the ' victory arch ' is now before us on this page , I am spared the anguish of having to describe it . . . . The locale selected is wrong for a victory arch . . . unless . . . we let the people who do the Macy Thanksgiving Parade , or the Soya Bean Association , or the Tight Rope Artists Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion this design . . . is atrocious in every respect . It is flimsy , it is ugly , it is inept . " <P> Wrote one prospective soldier to the Times : " Tradition dictates that at some point along the roadways of my city I 'll march under a victory arch . But under the proposed Willoughby thing . . . ? Never ! " <P> Other Times letter writers : " No ! No victory arches ! " " Dali on canvas is at times tolerable . Miss Willoughby 's ' Horse Feathers sprouting from a metronome ' is intolerable ! ... I vote a lusty no ! "
