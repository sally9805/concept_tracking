txt out slickers , " circle-herded , trail-herded , night-herded and crossherded too , " following the Longhorns from where the Gulf breeze blows with salty freshness on and on up a slow trail that endlessly pointed to the North Star , and then who , when they got back home from the long drive , read sign and guarded a range stretching houseless and fenceless from moonrise beyond all sunsets . Ask them . They know as much of the elements as the honking geese or the wolf hounded out of his den . Some of them can tell things of stampedes in electric storms that seem as foreign to this world of lights , warmth and comfortable shelters as the craters in the moon . It was a June night of the year 1884 , on the Cimarron . The air was hot , stifling , absolutely still . It had been thus all day . Now the sky became overcast , and dull sheet-lightning began to blink along the horizon to the west . Two men rode around twenty-five hundred big steers , as wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Rio Grande . About two hundred yards away was camp , though the fire of cow chips had died and not a spark revealed the nine sleeping forms out from the chuck wagon , their pallets spread in patternless formation . Near each sleeping man stood a horse ? his night horse , the clearest-footed and surest-sighted of his mount ? saddled and tied . Somewhere out in the darkness the horse-wrangler kept drowsy guard over the remuda . The cattle and the night were so quiet that the two herders stopped now and then on their rounds to listen . They could not help expecting something . The air grew warmer and more stifling , as the lightning flashes approached and dim thunder began to rumble up . The men could still skylight the cattle . Presently a dun steer that had been in the lead of the herd from the beginning and had been named " Old Buck " awoke , lifted his head slowly , rose to his knees , and looked around . Evidently he did not trust the looks of things , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled , and he said nothing . He got on his feet , raising his nose to smell , and gazed towards the approaching storm . The two men on guard sang as gently as they could the songs they had sung over and over to soothe the cattle down and prevent any sudden sound from breaking in and frightening them . But Old Buck had no idea of going back to bed . He seemed to be expecting something ? something as sudden as a telegram can be . Another steer got up , stood still , expectant ; then others and others arose until the whole herd was on its feet , motionless . The songs were louder now , unrelenting , pleading . The night grew blacker , the lightning brighter , the humidity of the air more intense . And then , almost at once , on every tip of the five thousand horns of the waiting steers , appeared a ball of dull phosphorescent light ? the fox fire , St. Elmo 's fire , willo ' - the- wisp of the folklore of the world . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lone prairie could see nothing but those eerie balls illuminating the tips of mighty antlers . But they were not thinking of ghosts or remembering ghost stories . Their voices rose high in the wild but cow-quieting notes of " The Texas Lullaby , " which is not made of words and ca n't be conveyed by musical notation . It is made of syllables and tones conveyable only by voices trained in darkness and deep thickets . The notes come long , low and trembly . The wailers of " The Texas Lullaby " did not yell or shoot , for that would have been to scare the as yet still cattle . The ghostly balls of fire on horns must have looked as strange to the steers as to the men . The steers began to move at a walk , their motion becoming circular , the riders around them preventing any decided movement away from the bed ground . At first the walk was slow ; soon it became faster . And then out of blackness came a great flash of zigzag lightning forking down over the seething @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame seemed almost to lick their backs . At the same time a 911 mighty clap , a roar , a crash of thunder shook heaven and earth , reverberating and doubling . Its answer was the thunder of ten thousand pounding hoofs that popped and clicked , while horn clacked against horn . The stampede started with the swiftness of the lightning 's leap . The cowboys arrived from camp just in time to join the pursuit . The gigantic thunderbolt had knocked out the sluice gates of the sky . The water poured down in sheets and barrels . It rained blue snakes , pitchforks and bob-tailed heifer yearlings all at once . One minute it was darker than the dead end of a crooked tunnel a mile deep under a mountain . Then the prairie was a sea of blue and yellow light dazzling to all eyes . No matter . Hang with the cattle . Trust your horse . Follow those balls of fire tossing in the void of blackness , too dim to illumine even the horn tips they play upon , sometimes darting across to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , truly , they may be the will-o ' - the- wisp that lures followers to the Black Death . When the lightning wo n't light , run by ear . When the lightning blinds and the thunder drowns all other sound , keep on riding hell for leather . To get around them and circle the leaders , you must run wilder and madder than the horror-lashed cattle themselves . It would probably have been better had the two night-herders not been recruited . The object was to swing the leaders around into the tail end of the herd , thus turning it into a mill . A single man who knew how could do this better than a bedlam of riders . Then gradually the whole mass would be wound into a self-stopping ball , the momentum dying down like that of a spent top . One of the two night-herders with this stampede on the Cimarron was Robert T. Hill , who in later years became a mining and oil geologist renowned over the United States and Mexico . " Before long , " he says , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cattle , close upon their heels . Never before nor since has thunder sounded to me so loud as on that run or have lightning crashes come so rapidly and so near . " At a crash that was the climax my horse stopped dead in his tracks , almost throwing me over the saddle horn . The lightning showed that he was planted hardly a foot from the edge of a steep-cliffed chasm . A little off to one side , the horse of John Gifford , the other rider , was sinking on his knees , John himself slumping limp in his saddle . Just beyond him lay Old Buck , the mighty lead steer , killed by the bolt of lightning that had knocked John Gifford unconscious . The rest of our bunch of cattle were down under the cliff , some of them dead , some squirming . " When morning came , clear and calm , not a man was in sight of the cook , all of whose provisions had been drenched and who could not begin to start a fire with the soaking-wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailed and guarded a thousand miles from southern Texas towards the market at Dodge City were scattered to the four winds . Before noon , though , men by ones and twos began driving in bunches from different directions . Hours later the last man was in . Meantime the wrangler was supplying fresh mounts and the boss , going at a long lope , was leading all hands , except two or three on herd , to comb the country . The men could eat later on , and a trail hand was supposed to get his sleep in the winter . The lightning could make its own chasm . One night while J. W. Carpenter was helping hold a great roundup herd of Long S cattle on the Staked Plains , the bombardment of eternity suddenly opened up overhead . The speed of the cattle across the open prairies was terrific . " They stretched out so that their bellies seemed to scrape the grass roots . " Then a bolt of lightning hit the ground in front of the avalanche , and at the same time a crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to halt or turn . There was no time . The headlong-tearing mob at their 94 heels , propelled by their own mass-velocity , plunged over the hesitating leaders . Some fell . The herd piled up , animals on the bottom being trampled to death . Now the stampede was without direction , some cattle trying to run in a circle , bunches cutting off this way and that , out of the melee coming a bawling and moaning that added terror to the thunderclaps . A herd milling about in a storm might seem to be trying to outdo the thunder with the noise of their bawling . W. J. Elliot of the Spur Ranch once heard " a kind of sigh " come from the expectant herd ? and the next instant the thunder of hoofs . In running , cattle do not voice sounds any more than race horses do . After a stampede was checked , however , the bawling and lowing were frequently tremendous . Hal Mangum told me that one night while he was racing alongside the leaders of a stampede , the cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly let out a bawl ? probably for her calf . " It acted like an air brake , and in a minute the whole herd was stopped and every animal in it bawling . " Some trail men wanted a few cows with calves mixed in with any herd of steers . In any run a calf would become separated from its mother , she would soon stop to bawl for it , and the bawl would tend to bring the steers to their senses and a halt . On the other hand , mixed cattle would not travel uniformly and in a bad run the young and weak were liable to be muti lated . The much-talked-about popping of horn against horn was not a regular concomitant of stampedes . More often than not , the runners were so far apart that their horns did not interfere . Now and then , the elements seemed to paralyze a herd beyond the power of running . It was out from Ogallala , Nebraska , that one appalling storm hit about midnight , in July , 1878 . One trail driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash lightning , then forked lightning , then chain lightning , followed by the most peculiar blue lightning 95 a I ever see , all playing close at hand . After this show , it developed into ball lightning rolling along the ground and all about us . Then there was spark lightning . . . . Finally the lightning settled down on us like a fog . The air smelled of burning sulphur . It turned so hot we thought we would be burned up . We had thirty-five hundred head of cattle . They kept milling all the time , bawling and moaning like they were in distress , but never made a move to stampede . " On another night when " one of those Kansas zephyrs cal-culated to blow hell off the range " breezed up with thunder and lightning to match , John Connor , only nineteen years old , was guarding the remuda . " The horses bunched together around me , " he said , " stuck their heads between their knees and moaned and groaned till I decided the end of time had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay flat on the ground and tried to die , but could not . " Occasionally lightning would strike the ground and set the grass on fire , then perhaps the rain would put it out . If no rain fell , the Indians received credit for the fire . They were less dreaded than pounding hailstones as big as hen eggs . After the cattle got wet , their long , polished horns glistened n the flashes out of the blackness , reflecting the light like moistened mirrors . The electricity played along the horn curves " as if they were lightning rods , " at the same time darting around and illuminating spurs and bridle bits . Balls of fox fire ran around he wet brim of a cowboy 's hat . Then the balls danced like pairs of spook-eyes not only on each head of horns out in the distance but on the ears , always working now , of the cowboy 's horse . If he popped his quirt , sparks would fly out of the cracker , and the switching of a cow 's tail emitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran over the backs of the cattle and along the manes of the horses . In the blinding blue-white , some men cast away six-shooters , purs , knives , thinking that steel would attract the lightning . 96 The sight of lightning racing around the tires of chuck-wagon wheels strengthened this idea . Heat was supposed to attract lightning also , and there were men who preferred being wet and cold to risking the effect of the dry warmth a good slicker might afford . Mexican vaqueros often wore a ball of beeswax ? a nonconductor of electricity ? fastened inside the high crown of their sombreros . In the great storms all profanity ceased . For a cowboy to use the name of God in vain at such a time would have been inviting the destruction threatened by the elements , would have been mocking the Almighty . " A herd of cows has lots of heat , and that draws litenin ' , " " Cyclone " Denton expressed a common belief in saying . Some-times , the faces of men riding on the leeward side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had been struck by a blast from a furnace . At the same time , the odor given off by the hoofs and horns was nearly overpowering . The faces of men who stayed with a stampede during an electrical storm might be burned " a brimstone blue . " Many more deaths undoubtedly came to cowboys from lightning than from stampedes themselves . In fact , the memories of living men and authentic records alike are notably deficient in instances of cowboys ' being trampled to death under stam-pedes . Dick Withers disposed of the matter thus : " We had a stampede in the Territory . My horse fell , and I thought the steers would run over me . But I soon learned that stampeding cattle will not run over a man when he is down underfoot . They will run all around a fellow , but I have yet to hear of a man being run over by them . " Ab Blocker says the night ca n't get too black for cattle to split and go around a man in front of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in a stampede . " On the other hand , not many men who knew cattle would have willingly got down in front of a stampede on a dark night to test out the splitting . 971 A stampede might start from anything ? but not , as has often been said , " from nothing . " Most of the unknown causes probably lay within the realm of smell , from which civilized man , generation by generation , becomes increasingly estranged . A breeze suddenly springing up after dark carried the odor of a Negro cooking for another outfit to a herd of steers that had been driven for three months by a Mexican crew without a bobble . They ran as if to make up for lost opportunities . The whiff of an Indian started many a run . Beef-hungry Indians not infrequently tried to stampede herds , so as to get a chance at scattered animals . One of their favorite ruses was to burn a sack of buffalo hair on the windward side of a herd . A stampede that lasted all night was started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled the blood of a yearling just butchered for camp . A panther smelled some fresh beef hanging close to a chuck wagon . Trying to get to it , he was sensed by the cattle ? and the powderhouse blew up . Here was a great herd , any antlered creature of which would have chased the biggest lobo of North America and , if able to catch him , would have gored him to death ; yet the sharp smell of a coyote cub coming unexpectedly to a certain steer might startle him and the startlement be instantly translated into mob panic . The fact that oftentimes the cause could not be sensed by men , could in no way be accounted for , and that the run seemed to be contrary to all known principles of cow psychology , gave to it something of dark mystery . It would be bright moonlight . A cowboy , halted in his rounds , perhaps smoking a pipe or cigarette , would be looking at a great herd of steers bedded down comfortably and spaciously on the rich grass of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with heads north , some south , some east , some west . They had been eased to the bed grounds , after a light day 's travel , full of grass and water , contented . Then , in one instant , every animal would be plunging in mad flight , all in one direction . 98J Such a stampede was unusual ; it was the exception . It was one of the profound mysteries of nature that the Children of the Sea of Grass saw manifested , and that operated to make them , under a rough-and-ready exterior , mystics and fatalists . Many of them held that cattle dreamed and saw ghosts . Certainly they were sometimes nervous in their sleep . Ab Blocker claims that if upon bedding down at night a majority of the cattle stretched their heads out in the same direction ? then was the time to look for a run before morning . This was his " sign . " Another sign was " a peculiar snort " made by some of the cattle before they ran . Yet no panic flight can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a belief with various trail men ? despite the contrary experiences of others ? that after a herd crossed the Arkansas River it would not stampede again . It was a saying that if you could drive a herd for two weeks without a stampede , the danger was over . It certainly was ' diminished . The change from familiar to strange surroundings and from sleeping in free isolation to being bedded down with a horde of other animals guarded by the most fearsome enemy of cow liberty that the primitive cattle knew ? man ? was naturally conducive to nervousness and panic . On their home range , cattle are familiar with every bush , gully , and stone . Driven into a territory where nothing is familiar , they are apprehensive . After some days of trailing , however , change becomes routine . Some cowboys went strong on premonitions . This one " felt a quiver in his spine " when he went on guard and " just knew " the stampede was coming . That one " felt the air charged with tenseness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night air . An Arizona waddie , who had learned about spirits from an Apache medicine man , said : " When cattle has got these stompede devils in ' em , anybody can tell it . As soon as the sun goes down , their eyes begin to burn like bull's-eye lanterns . And when you ride in among ' em you can just feel that crazy , 99 ) locoed spirit . " Cowboys not superstitious about anything else were often superstitious about stampedes . On occasions a stampede that seemed inevitable might not eventuate at all . One stormy night in Kansas a trail boss named Lankford became strangely apprehensive . " I had been working for him for ten years , " Ben Thorne told me , " and this was the first time I ever saw him disturbed . " I just know something 's going to happen , ' Lankford kept saying . I just feel I 'll never get out of this . I do n't know what it is , but something inside me says this is my night to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him nothing unusual was up , but he would n't be persuaded . Meantime the lightning was coming thicker and faster , and the thunder was rolling up . Lankford had ordered all hands to the herd . I was riding beside him when we saw a ball of lightning shoot down right over where the herd was and split into a million sparks and splinters . We halted a minute to listen for the rumble of the running and to locate its direction . There was not a sound . We rode on . Still there was not a sound . The thunder had passed on . When we got a little nearer , the voice of a cowboy on guard came steady and quiet over the night air . He was singing , Oh , listen to the crickets . ' I thought it mighty purty , and I guess those Longhorns thought the same way . They were all laying down as still as mice . I never was more surprised in my life . Lankford seemed to feel right sheepish . " Obvious trivialities started more stampedes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and smelling around a sleeping animal on the edge of the herd ; a bunch of wild hogs rooting into the bed grounds ; the sight of a haystack after dark in a field into which a herd of old and leery beeves had , been turned for the night ? " so that the boys could get some rest " ; the cough of a cow ; a human sneeze ; the snapping of a twig ; the sinking of a circling horse 's foot in a prairie dog I00 hole . It was suddenness of a sound or movement rather than its unfamiliarity that made the drags wake up and forget all about sore feet. , A polecat would come sashaying along in its non-chalant way into the edge of a herd ; some steer , awake and investigative , would begin following the hopping creature . Then , noticing the approaching monster , the little hair-ball would stop , pat its forefeet against the ground and go to jerking its tail with comical swiftness : ) Mr. Steer had never seen this performance before ? and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snort , having no intention of starting a stampede , but a mo-ment later he was part of the panic terror he had caused . Like people , cattle are at their best when separated from the mob . The worst stampede I was ever in , in my limited experience , was with about a thousand head of steer yearlings on the Nueces River . We had spent the hours from before daylight until slap dark on a July day ? fifteen hours at least ? making fifteen miles through a country of lanes and thickets . We put the dogies to bed that night in the only place we could put them , though it was not at all to be chosen ? a patch of open space with a fence on one side , the bluffs of the river on the other , and a ranch house not two hundred yards away on a third side . The country out and around was a thicket of thorns cut up with barbed wire and gullies . Camp was made close to the house . The night was dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicked an iron latch on the yard gate . I heard it ? as plain as if a six-shooter had been clicked in my ear . The yearlings heard too . They ran into gullies ; some of them piled over the bluff ; they kept run-ning intermittently all night long . After we got them home and spread them out in the pastures , a hundred or two of them would for weeks get together every few nights and run to Jericho , tear-ing down fences and cutting themselves up . Just the click of a gate latch . IOI In nearly any herd of grown cattle a professional agitator was likely to show up . He was likely to find one or more corn-paneros . They spent most of their time looking for boogers and hunting some pretext to run . They were usually slab-sided and brainless . They would prowl at night when all decent animals were in bed , sometimes hooking sleeping cattle up either to get them agitated or to take their warm places on the ground . A real cowman would after a few runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stampeder might not be evil-intentioned ; he might be blind in one eye or unable to see dis-tinctly at all and would thus be stumbling and scaring at nothing , setting the other cattle off . Many a herd boss went on having stampedes without discovering the cause , baffled by the " mys-tery . " " Nobody nowadays , " Sug Robertson said , about 1904 , " knows what a stampede is . These modern high-bred cattle ca n't get scared or run either like the old-time Texas cattle . In 1871 I was working on the Flat Top Ranch , in Coleman County , Texas . The main trail to New Mexico and Arizona split it open . This was the Goodnight ? Loving Trail , which , after leaving the headwaters of the Middle Concho River , led ninety miles over a country without a drop of water before hitting Horsehead Cross-ing on the Pecos . Lots of cattle were being driven west at the time , and ranchmen from sixty to a hundred miles around threw in and hired me to inspect all herds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was what was called a trail-cutter . " That year John Chisum had several herds moving into New Mexico . He led the first herd himself ? 6000 stock cattle . Too many cattle of any kind for a single herd , but he drove that way so as to concentrate his forces against the Indians . Coming behind this herd , following eight or ten miles back , were 3000 head of big steers , from four years old up to twenty . They were owned and bossed by a man named Adams , and when I inspected them he told me they had been stampeding every night ? the IO2 J habit most dreaded by all trail drivers . Adams did n't have to tell me they had been running on him . They were ga'nted like a roundup of starved coachwhip snakes , and all of them had the scours . " The stampede that started this nightly running , Adams said , was away down in southern Texas when a horse being ridden into camps from the second relief stepped into the opening of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what this contraption was doing in a cow camp , but there it was . The horse 's hoof hung . In stumbling he got rid of his rider and then he lit out a-running . Every time he struck the ground with that postage-stamp saddle fastened on his hoof he made a noise that none of those old mossy-headed steers had ever heard or dreamed of . They hit the ground with a roar that would have drowned a clap of thunder , coming straight for camp . Most of the hands cleared out , but the cattle smashed the chuck wagon into smithereens and threw the cook 's hip out of joint . The next morning there was n't anything left of the corn meal and other grub but a little color in the dirt . Running into the wagon and outfit that way must have given those scalawags a scare far worse than what started them . Adams and his men , though , were all puzzled as to what kept the steers running every night . They 'll stampede that way just from habit , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to set them off . " Both Chisum 's and Adams ' herds were moving slow , filling up for the dry time ahead of them , and I rode along with them for several days , spending most of my time with Chisum 's outfit , gradually working out a few strays and enjoying the company . At Eighteen Mile Crossing on the Concho River I decided to turn back . I had no hankering to again make that dry drive ahead . John Chisum was the best all-around cowman I ever knew . When I got ready to leave , he said he 'd ride back with me as far as the Adams herd and see if he could n't locate what was making the steers run . 103 " We reached them about the time they were bedding down . Adams told Chisum to take charge . Well , bed ' em down as usual , ' Chisum said , and after they are settled I 'll ride through ' em and see what I can see . ' " It was twilight and the moon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rode around with Chisum , taking lessons . After he had looked for twenty or maybe thirty minutes , taking in individually every animal he saw , he stopped and called to Adams , who came over to where we were . He did n't let out a yell , you 'll understand , just called in a quieting sort of way . " There 's the cause of your stampedes , ' he said . He pointed to a lanky paint steer about as narrow between the eyes as a razorback hog and with corkscrew horns . Most significant of all , the steer was one-eyed . In other words , he could n't see and did n't have any sense besides . " Cut that steer out , drive him down to the river and kill him , ' Chisum ordered . " The order was put into execution at once . The steers did not make even a jump that night . I learned afterwards that there was not another stampede on the whole drive . That crazy oneeyed steer had been setting the whole three thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The discovery of the agitator might be a mere accident . In 1869 , A. Branshaw was with a herd that kept stampeding and stampeding , nobody able to find out why . One bitter , cold night in the Indian Nation , a low moon and the stars giving plenty of light to see by , Branshaw , who was on guard , dismounted outside the circle of sleeping cattle and began leading his horse . The cattle were all lying down except a big white steer . Suddenly Branshaw saw this steer leap into the air and hit the ground with a thud , his nose seeming to make a part of the impact . He gave a grunt that sounded more like that of a hog than of a cow brute . That was the signal . The whole herd was 104 J up like a shot , headed for the footman . The horse jerked loose and ran ; the man climbed a tree . The next day he told the boss about the white steer . Old Whitey was traded to a Choctaw Indian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not caught in the act , but was finally suspected on general principles . He bellowed like a bugle , and hence his name . He was a big paint and was always in the lead . One evening the boss said , " Cut out Old Bugler , run him to one side , rope and tie him there . " That night , to the great relief of the men , the cattle kept their beds till dawn . Every night thereafter Old Bugler was staked off from the other cattle , and stampedes were no more . The best way to manage a stampede was to prevent it . A good herd boss would not bed his cattle on ground that sounded hollow , in a narrow valley , or on a rough point . He picked , if possible , the kind of level ground the cattle would pick for themselves for a bed . He kept the camp quiet and not too far away from the herd . He watered out the cattle thoroughly and saw that they got their fill of grass before lying down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Live Oak County , I used to have a horse named Buck that I now think of far oftener than I think of most people I have known . On his left forefoot , which was stockinged , he had the scar of a rattlesnake bite . At the rattle of a snake or , frequently , of the somewhat similar rattle of dried thistle seed struck by a stirrup , he would jump with the suddenness of a shot . Year after year , no matter how often I passed a certain agrito ( wild barberry ) bush growing close to the road , a few hundred yards from home , he would shy . One time he had heard and seen a rattlesnake at that bush . In spring and summer rattlesnakes stay around the agritos waylaying birds and other small creatures that feed on the dropped berries . Buck had a very strong association of ideas . Cattle are like horses and men in the association of ideas ? 105 ideas of stampeding . Men and other animals that live close to the soil probably have stronger associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book of the Northwest , Ubet , John R. Barrows tells of driving a herd of I400 big steers across a long dry stretch and bedding them down in the darkness about five miles out from the Yellowstone River . Before morning a breeze sprang up from the direction of the water . Instantly every animal was on his feet , and , with heads lifted , the fourteen hundred let out a chorus that said they had smelt water and were going to it . For about three hours the men managed to keep them under some kind of restraint , but at the first streak of dawn they got beyond all control . The leaders were belly deep in the Yellowstone while the drag was still two miles away . " It took a long time for every animal to satisfy his thirst , and this operation was about concluded when from the cliffs on the opposite side of the river came the reverberating reports of a dozen blasts of dynamite , made by the Northern Pacific Railroad construction crews beginning their day 's work . The whole herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before riders could check them . From this point we drove one hundred miles down the river , and every day when we put the cattle into the water we were compelled to handle the inevitable stampede as soon as their thirst was satisfied and association of ideas had time to operate . " All primitive animals are expectant at waterings . There , they know by instinct , predatory animals lie in wait . The title of Frederic Remington 's most famous painting , " The Fight at the Water Hole , " might characterize the struggle for existence in the animal world for a million years . A good boss would send a man ahead of his herd to scare ducks off the water . If they flew up after cattle began to drink , there might be no end to the running . A wavelet tickling the nose of some old snuffy steer muzzling the water might make him jump the whole herd into panic . 1o6 MAN does everything best ? or worst ; and next to thunder and lightning , nothing could put more terror into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tentionally or unintentionally . Many a stampede was started by some prank of boyish innocence . That 's one reason why many trail bosses would not allow a boy along . Along about 19oo , Jim Dobie bought the Dubose cattle on the Barbon and sent Sid Grover to receive them . After branding them , Sid Grover decided to hold them overnight in a pen and 107 l detailed men to ride around it , two at a time . Some bosses preferred to put a man inside the pen to keep the cattle stirred up and awake against surprise . The night was rather cold , and when Charlie Dubose and one of the Pierce boys ? both of them just kids ? came in from their guard , they were delighted at the spectacle Old Mose , a Negro cowboy , presented . He was lying on his back , dead asleep , with his feet towards the fire . One great flat , splay foot had got from under the blanket and , with the big toe forked out , was spread towards the fire like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how close they could bring a chunk of fire to Old Mose 's sole before he winced . They moved a mesquite chunk up fairly close ; Mose did not notice it . They brought it closer and closer . At last they began to sniff the burning horny growth that covered the old darkey 's soles . Yet , apparently , he felt it no more than a cow feels the burn on the end of her horn . He was like the barefooted gal from Arkansas . " Sal , take yer foot off that thar coal , " her granny called out . " Wal now , which foot ? " Sal wanted to know . Then the burn got through the horny sole and struck the quick ! Mose jumped with the alacrity of a Spanish bull and at the same time let out a yell that would have done credit to sixteen Comanches . The cattle awoke as quick as he did and had knocked the fence down and were on their way to Jericho before the boys on herd knew what had happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more cattle . " That is the way a quiet little old man , a certain Chaucerian shyness and gentleness in him and very religious , named Alonzo Mitchell , of Lampasas , Texas , tells it . " That year , 1875 , " he said , " we were taking up a mixed herd to Wichita , Kansas . It was mixed sure enough ? cows , bulls , steers , but no calves or yearlings . Lots of times a man could n't tell from the looks of one of those cows that she was going to io8 have a calf before daylight . She was wiry and ga'nt and could run , jumping bushes like a deer , even when about to bring a calf . Some of our cows begun having calves before we got across the Brazos River , and they kept on having calves all the way up . Generally they 'd be dropped on the bed ground at night . The next morning we 'd shoot ' em in the head with sixshooters and go on . A calf just born is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd . We had an ox wagon , with the bed calked for crossing rivers , but it did n't have room for hauling the calves , and calf wagons ' had n't then come into use . The calves were not worth much of anything . We had to take the cows along or lose them . The shooting was just an act of mercy . " Some people would rope the cows at night and hobble them , so 's to keep them from going back to hunt their calves . I do n't remember that our cows gave us much trouble . They seemed to know their calves were dead . Sometimes one would have a calf while trailing along . She 'd drop back into the drag , and then we 'd let her stopuntil she was fully delivered , shoot the calf , and drive her on . " When we got into North Texas , a woman came to the bed ground before daylight one morning driving a wagon . She asked if we had any little calves . We said maybe so . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to get rid of them anyway . She got three or four and put them in her wagon . The next morning , ten or twelve miles north of that camp , she was on hand again , this time with a boy to help . She must 've been raising quite a bunch of dogies . We learned she was picking up calves from all the cow herds passing her way . She had better luck than the Kansas nester who got to a steer herd after dark to await the morning crop of calves . The boss told him he could have them if he 'd take a turn at standing guard . Somehow his trick ' lasted from the first shift till it got light enough for him to see the animals in the herd . Then he rode away without even coming to camps for coffee . 109 . l " In our herd were steers that stood seventeen hands high and were as fat as mud . Talk about beef ! But we did n't kill any of our stuff while on the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? later recognized as tick fever ? and we were afraid to eat the meat of trail cattle . Some outfits butchered range cattle they sighted along the trail , but we did n't believe in that sort of business . " Our leaders were a pair of prairie steers we named Broad and Crump . Broad was a brown with wide-spreading horns that twisted straight out ; Crump was a white with horn tips that crumpled in . When they walked , their heads would sway , their horns weighed so much , but they 'd walk side by side , right up at the lead , day after day , with their heads swinging in such harmony that their horns never clicked or interfered with each other . The way they got timed to each other was remarkable , and we boys used to talk about it often . When they were grazing in high grass , heads hidden , we could see their horns bobbing and balancing . " When there was a stompede ? and we had several on this trip ? no matter which way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Broad and Crump would soon be in the lead . If a man racing along towards the point got a glimpse of them by a flash of lightning or skylighted them , he 'd yell across to any hand on the other side to give way , for he knew that with Broad and Crump leading , he could turn the runaways and put them in a mill . Chain lightning caused more stompedes than anything else , and next came lobo wolves ? the smell of them . After we got up into the Indian Territory , we could depend upon nearly all the storms ' coming from the northwest . We and the cattle both generally got warnings out of the sky , but the storm nearly always broke with great suddenness and fury . " The cowboys would holler to the cattle and sing and pray . Yes , they 'd pray to God loud , making all sorts of promises . Then I IO next morning at breakfast they 'd laugh , cursing and poking fun at themselves and each other . " Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " No . ' " Well , ' each man said to me at one time or another , I pray when I get scared . I do n't see how anybody keeps from it . ' " I ' 11 tell you , ' I said more'n once , why I do n't pray . When I was twenty-one years old I turned myself over to my Heavenly Father . I pray to him regularly , and under his care I 'm no more scared when it lightnings than when it do n't . ' " On one trip up the trail we got next to a herd that was stompeding every night almost , the owner said . I told him he must be packing his cattle too close on the bed ground . If cattle were bedded down so close together that a steer switching his tail hit another in the face , there was mighty apt to be a stompede . The critter hit would jump up with a beller , and then the whole herd would be off like a flash in the pan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle for him . I had an awful time getting his men to spread out and let the cattle take natural room and positions , just as they 'd take if left to themselves . Good gracious , ' the man kept saying , how much more room do they need ? ' And , We 're going to have an awful big territory to ride around , ' he 'd say . I told him the men on guard had to keep riding anyhow and it did n't make any more work to ride around five acres than one . " After the cattle got their positions , there was a full steerlength between many a one of them and the next animal . There was n't a bobble that night . The trail boss was satisfied . From then on he gave his stuff plenty of room and had no trouble above the ordinary . " Up in the Indian Nation somewhere , south of a creek that I ca n't remember the name of , a man who was loose-herding a small bunch of cattle met our herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every herd that crossed that creek , III he said , was stompeding . According to him , a jayhawker was waylaying the place , and , after the cattle ran and split up , was cutting off little bunches and driving them up a side canyon , where he 'd hold them until the owners got out of the country and then turn them over to a gang of fellow thieves . " This creek had a reputation up and down the trail , but the cause of the stompedes had been a mystery . The trail down to the crossing was steep and thickly timbered on both sides , with lots of underbrush besides , all cut by gullies . The average herd did not have a man riding in front of it , the two point men guiding the leaders and holding them down if they got to walking too fast . " My brother Bob Mitchell was boss , and when we started down to the creek bottom , he took his place on the right point . He did n't show hisse'f , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front and doing their duty , he rode so 's to get a look ahead . D'reckly he saw something black down in the bottom flop like two big wings . He pulled his six-shooter and shot , and a man left on his horse in a hurry . Bob just got one glimpse of him in the brush . We got across all right . " The stompeder left his paraphernalia right where he was in the habit of using it . It consisted of a kind of scarecrow with adjustable wings that could be moved up and down . When the lead animals of a herd suddenly saw this thing working at close quarters , of course they 'd tear out , those following down the hill breaking off from the narrow trail-opening and scattering from hell to breakfast . " We made camp that night on the prairie . On the edge of it next to the creek were a lot of oak trees . A funny thing . Next morning the man that had been stompeding the herds was hanging from a limb of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail so 's not to scare any cattle . Right by him was hanging his scarecrow machine . He hung hisse'f so he would n't stompede no more cattle . That 's what they said . " And here the reader may visualize a little wink and hear in II2 J imagination a little laugh from the lean , little , lithe and brighteyed man who told me this story when he was eighty-five years old . That professional " stompeder " was doing his work in the daytime . Daylight runs were common , though generally easier to handle than the night ones and less dangerous to man and beast . However , they could be serious . One year a Millet herd , upon crossing the Wichita River of the Indian Territory , found all the grass burned off except that upon a tongue of land protected between two creeks . Apparently all the prairie chickens in the country had come to this unburned sod ; they were there by the thousands . The three thousand steers got their fill on the grass among the prairie chickens , bedded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning when the birds began to whirr up , the cattle tore out over the rough country in every direction . Several were killed and about a hundred got away . In the seventies some of the north-bound herds of Central Texas passed through Stephenville . It was n't much of a village , and a few fenced-in fields made going around it inconvenient . There were six or seven log cabins , with shed rooms of rawhide lumber , strung along the trail and out from it . The central and largest structure served as a courthouse . It had a gallery covered with boards made of pin oak . The liveliest place in town was a saloon , where , for two-bits , a purchaser could get a " fair-sized drink " of wagon-yard whisky drawn in a tin cup from fifty-gallon barrel . Usually a group of cowboys were congregated here , but the dogs of the village far outnumbered both inhabitants and visitors . Dog fights furnished the chief amusement . The sheriff owned a large parrot that habitually perched on the roof of the courthouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cowboys , including profanity . Its favorite expression was " Ye-oh , sic ' em ! " which usually started a dog fight . c " 4 It One day a herd was stringing through town , shying but keeping the middle of the road , when the parrot flapped his wings , gave a cowboy yell , and screeched " Ye-oh , sic ' em ! " In a second all the dogs in town charged the steers . They stampeded , knocked down all the galleries , including the one the parrot was perched on , rammed through the sheds , and even demolished some of the shacks . Stephenville looked as if a cyclone had struck it . People not acquainted with cow nature think that shutting cattle up in a pen eliminates the danger of stampedes . Cattle used to being free are , in fact , more nervous in a pen than anywhere else . If a good-sized herd inside a big pen scares , they have a space for a run against the fence . Unless it is very strong , it is smashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the cattle behind , forming a gigantic battering ram , rush over them and surge on over the fence , then through it , tearing it down from the top . If the pen is small and strong and the cattle are crowded into it , they are not likely to get through the fence , but they will be unable to lie down and rest , will mill all night , will lose weight , and the next day wo n't drive well . Every night so spent means a loss on the cattle . I was with a herd of Double Circle cows and heifers ? 1700 head of straight-bred Herefords ? trailing down to the Gila River in Arizona . The boss was J. H. Willis , and when we reached the Chiricahua Ranch on the third evening of the drive , he asked me what I thought about penning . We had spent nearly the whole day coming through a mountain pass , the cattle had eaten very little , and some were getting footsore . I did not like the idea of penning at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plank pen . We camped maybe three hundred yards away . About two o'clock one of the Apache cowhands gave a yell . It was unnecessary , for the pounding rumble had awakened every man . In a minute we were all on our ready-saddled horses . It was light enough so that , as we approached the pens , we could El 115 see the stream of cattle pouring through two or three panels of fence they had knocked down . There was no stopping them until they were all out . The lay of the mountain land was in our favor , and before noon all the " cherrycows " we had gath-ered in the run were cut out , all of ours were counted in , and we were going on down to the hot Gila . Those Hereford cattle did not tear out of the pen with any-thing like the power , the velocity and the mania for getting away that a penful of old Texas Longhorn steers would have demonstrated . In 1885 A. B. Harper helped drive a thousand head of steers of mixed ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills above Kerrville on the Guadalupe River . They got in the habit of stampeding and ran almost every night . When they finally reached their destination , Captain Schreiner ordered them put in his main pens overnight , to be branded next day . The pens were big and were made with Ger-man thoroughness and ponderosity out of logs ? not rails ? laid ten feet high between heavy posts sunk deep in the ground . Then heavy log buttresses braced the fence all around from the outside . It was a pen nothing could break down . The worn-out men were eating a late supper when they heard the stampede thunder they were so used to . They ran to the fence . The steers had hit it , and already some of them , climb-ing upon the bodies of the advance impact , had their heads over the top logs . The men quirted , yelled , and turned the climbers back . Those steers kept running all night long , but after three or four runs the leaders learned to veer at the fence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , not counting slipped horns and cripples still able to walk , about twenty-five animals were dead or so badly injured as to make killing them necessary . Along the routes followed by drovers before the Civil War , from the interior of Texas to Shreveport and New Orleans , " stands " were established a day 's drive apart . Here the drovers I16 1 could get meals and pen for the night . Night-herding was not the usual order as on the great trails to the north . The builders of the pens anticipated rushes by the mighty Texas steers , but there were disastrous runs . At a plantation " stand " near Shreveport a herd , after killing or fatally injuring many of their number , broke over the pen fence , demolished a carriage house and its fine vehicles , ran into the slave quarters , and not only flattened out cabins but killed one Negro family . The steers left alive after this stampede were not nearly sufficient to compensate for the damages . How far would cattle run if not checked , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generally , not so far as the fiction writers take them . In 1888 Tex Crosse was standing guard on the Pecos River . The advance wind of an approaching storm blew his hat off . It went rolling over the backs of two or three steers . It would have rolled over more if there had been any backs left . After a run that lasted only a few minutes , the whole herd circled back to the exact point of starting , stopped , and bedded down for the rest of the night . This return was very unusual . Trail bosses as a rule did not , after a run , want to try the same bed ground again . Some stampedes took such odd forms that almost any story about the subject is believable . One night , while trailing over a long , dry stretch , Charles Goodnight had half of his herd moving along in sober , orderly manner while the other half raced up one side , around the point , down the other side and through the drags , stampeding around and around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head-on collision between two stampeding herds , one running full-tilt south , the other north . There may be some connection between this event and a toast that an embarrassed cowboy was called upon to give at a city banquet . All he could think of was a poem he had learned in camp : 117 They met on the bridge at midnight , t They never will meet again . One was a west-bound heifer , The other an east-bound train . While H. W. Anshutz was riding line one day in 1883 in No Man 's Land near the Cimarron River , he heard a tinkling of bells on the Tuttle Trail , which led to Dodge City . Riding over , he saw a herd of around six hundred unusually rough mossyhorns , about half of them belled . The boss said that the old scalawags had been roped out of the brush , and that the bells were to help his men keep up with them during night stampedes . Some days later Anshutz , riding in the same vicinity , saw about twenty-five head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the north . Not long afterwards the Texans , on their way home , gave an account of the stampede near Dodge City . The twenty-five runaways had covered the sixty miles back to the Cimarron in fifteen hours . That is a good record . However , at ten o'clock one Friday night in 1884 a herd of 5064 big steers , bossed by Ben Doughty , stampeded north of the Platte River , and at eleven o'clock on Sunday morning , thirty-seven hours later , thirty-five of them were seen one hundred and twenty miles south . This is the record , so far as I know . These steers had been scared on by nesters and prevented from resting or grazing . Of course they could not have run the entire distance ; they had run long distances , trotted , stopped , walked . A grown steer could easily walk better than three miles an hour . Cowboys who hung with cattle intermittently running all night long were not , as a rule , when day finally broke more than five or ten miles from camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle would turn , or mill , if not forced : to the right or to the left , clockwise or counterclockwise . Goodnight and other cowmen have claimed they always milled to the right . Perhaps there is a 118 pronounced right-handedness in the whole animal world . It is said that a tadpole in changing into a frog invariably grows his first foreleg on the right side and then , after his left foreleg , the right hind leg . Plainsmen have described how buffaloes upon being rushed into a stockade by Indian hunters always ran to the right from the entrance ? though this would throw the penned-up herd into a left-handed , or counterclockwise , mill . Probably ninety per cent of North American cattle are branded on the left side . The practice of so branding them may be based on the inclination of cattle to pull to the right , leaving the " brand side " out for a view . Yet any cow can dodge to the left as well as to the right and keep her brands on either side exasperatingly hidden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull to the right might account for the righthanded direction of many of them . In a way , drifts were more persistent than stampedes . A herd , more often than not in wet weather , might be impelled by something in cattle nature to drift ? not running at all , but walking with solid determination . A phalanx of fifty cowboys could not turn back such a herd , if it were at all sizable . All they could do would be to drift with the cattle , somewhat checking them and keeping them from scattering . One day about noon a cold rain began driving from the east on a herd of Laurel Leaf steers crossing the Indian Territory . The cattle refused to quarter it , to keep the trail leading due north , but turned west , moving with a solid front instead of in trail formation . After the men , all soaking wet and cold , had tried desperately but futilely for hours to check the drift , the boss said , " Let ' em drift . Just try to string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To use the words of William O'Neal , " Dark found us in a timbered bottom , and then we struck the river . It was lightning , and we could see the water whirling down like a sea . But the 119 cattle took it , and there was nothing to do but follow . After we crossed , we came to a big prairie . The wind lulled some , and there we held ' em up . " Several herds had crossed ahead of us , and they were hold-ing on the big prairie . Before long they got to running , and the roar was so great at times that we cowboys could not hear each other speak . Our own cattle were trying to run too , but we held them . The other herds had all got mixed , and when it light-ened and we got a glance northward , it looked to me as if there were leagues and leagues of horns , all seething . " With one of the herds was a boss named Perkins . He had a voice like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellering to the men to let the cattle scatter . God damn it , ' he yelled , if you do n't let these cattle scatter , they 'll tromp each other to death . ' He was right , too , for take ten or twelve thousand big steers , mill ' em together , and the inside cattle will get down . The men let the stuff spread out , and next morning they were over that prairie for miles . We rode over carcasses of big steers as flat on the ground as if their hides had been peeled off and staked out . They had fallen or got knocked down , and then thousands of hoofs had tromped over them . " No stampede was more dreaded by men responsible for property than a running together of several herds . This mixture was possible only on the trail , at places where passage was clogged , or near destinations . In the late spring of 1882 Red River got up so high from continuous rains that trail bosses were afraid to trust their cattle to its swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all waiting to get over , could be counted south of Doan 's Crossing , and besides these there were two or three trail herds of horses . That night all the " corn waggins " between heaven and earth rumbled across the skies , and it rained regular waterfalls over the whole country . All the herds stampeded , run-ning into each other , milling and mixing until at daybreak not I20 1 a single outfit had its property separate . The two thousand or so wild horses ? mustangs with a brand on them ? were keeping up the confusion and adding to it by racing back and forth through the cattle , nickering for their lost companions and trying to get together and get away . It took Ito cowboys ten days to reshape into their respective herds the 33,000 head of cattle of that mix-up . I2I HORSES can see better at night than cattle , and probably have a finer sensitiveness to what is ahead . Many a horse on a night of pitchy darkness has suddenly halted , trembling and refusing to go an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash of lightning or by getting down and feeling the ground , that he was at the very edge of a precipice . Some very sensitive blind people feel in an indefinable way , perhaps by vibrations in the air , the presence of an obstacle they have not touched . It may be that a void of space is thus sometimes sensed by a horse without his being able to see it , though horses have gone over the brink also . A horse can stop more quickly than a cow brute . I22 The lead steers in a stampede , even if they sensed a gulf and would stop , were pushed on by the running battering-ram at their tails . In 1872 , on the Smoky River near Hays City , Kansas , Mark Withers while running in the lead of a stampede saw by a flash of lightning that he was on the edge of a high bluff . His only recourse was to spur on . His horse , uninjured , landed in three or four feet of water . Instead of going on across , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From this protected point he heard and saw by flashes the steers pouring down . A large number were killed and crippled . A great majority of the tall jumps made by cowboys are found in tales just a little taller . " Talk about it being dark ! " Frank Mitchell of the J A 's used to tell . " It was darker'n the inside of a cow with her lights drilled out . The stompeders headed for a bluff that I did n't know existed and went on over like hell after a preacher . I was riding on their fetlocks when my night horse ? and , God , he was a good one ? went with ' em . " He did n't make a bobble goin ' down , jest kept steady , his feet straight out . I do n't know how long we was making the descent . I had time for several thoughts and could have rolled a cigarette maybe . I was still a-settin ' in the saddle like a reg'lar hand when Flying Machine ? that 's what I named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there like he wanted to rest a while . I sorter teched him with the spur , but he could n't budge , it seemed . Derned if we did n't stay there till daylight , and then I see he 's bogged up to his knees in solid rock . That little ex-perience shore developed his eyesight , and after that he was a better night horse than ever . " A cowboy might have to ride something besides space . In San Antonio one day old Tom Gilroy told me this story , swearing to the truth of it . " One time going up the trail our outfit had a cowboy named 123 Jack . He was sorter weak-minded like , and always slept a ways off from camps and on the south side of the herd . One night a norther hit with a bang , and the steers stompeded ? south . Jack did n't have no time to get on his horse . He run a ways in the only direction he could run , away from the stompede . Before he was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled over a time or two , and lost his six-shooter . He did n't have no time to feel around for it . By now he could hear the steers right on his hocks . He butted into a tree and then shinned up it . After he 'd got about ten feet up and thought he was safe , he heard the unearthliest growl a man ever heard . He skylighted , and there right above him was a panther , stretched out and just moving its tail like a panther does when he 's about to spring . " Jack took one look below . There was n't anything under him but horns going by like the clatter-wheels of hell . Quicker'n I can tell , he decided he 'd ruther risk riding a Longhorn than being rode by a panther . He leaped off on the back of a big white steer that made a good target to jump at . And he rode that critter till he was carried out of the main herd to a clear place where it seemed safe to drop off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back when he turned him loose . " In 1876 Wilson Brothers of Kansas City bought a big string of mature steers in Central Texas and concentrated them in one herd , west of the Brazos River . There were about twenty-five cowboys in the outfit ? too many . At ten o'clock the cattle appeared to be sleeping safely , though some of them were nerv-ous . During the preceding afternoon an electrical storm had made them jumpy . Then they had shied at a rainbow , one end of which almost touched the pointers of the herd . The men who rode that night always insisted that the rainbow and dreams of it were back of the stampede . The stars were out and the breeze was soft when the cattle jumped , heading for the breaks cutting into the Brazos River . 124 1 it The eldest of the Wilson brothers and one cowboy got to the point of the runners first , on the left side . The stampede would soon have been in a mill had it not been for a Mexican . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He raced around them on the right side , getting to the leaders just as Wilson and the man with him were turning them from the other side . He began shooting . The running cattle straightened back . Just ahead was a deep gully . Wilson and two or three additional men who had by now caught up with him saw the gully and jerked to one side , but the main herd was already upon them . Wilson yelled , " Shoot to kill . " The riders succeeded in killing enough steers to make a kind of breastworks for splitting the oncoming mass . The gully filled with plunging animals , trampling and crushing those underneath to death . The men found a crossing and threw the herd ? what was left of it ? into a mill . When the count was made next day , 2700 steers were missing , the majority of that number dead . For a long time horns marked the sides of the gully and were strewn down its bed . It is known yet as Stampede Gully . The Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal faster prevented his crossing the Brazos River next day . Had Wilson ridden alone , or with only one man along , and had a six-shooter not been pulled from the scabbard , the stampede would have been controlled . If a man wanted to stampede a bunch of cattle , he could not find an easier or more effective way than shooting near them ? as an excitable cowboy on guard one night found out when he cut loose on a Spanish dagger , thinking it was an Indian . One time , Oscar Rush wrote , he was helping drive a string of " Southern " steers in New Mexico when one of them " busted " out of the herd and refused to be turned back . The owner of the herd gave chase , and as the runaway went over a hill , proceeded to smoke him up . Down the hill was a windmill at which 125 about three hundred range steers were taking their noon rest . The firing and the terrified animal plunging into their midst set them off . They circled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination split like a covey of quail , some of them running until dark . There were fourteen hundred head of steers in the pasture where the so-called cowman experimented with his six-shooter . The next morning there were only two hundred head , and five hundred of the missing were later rounded up sixty miles away . Six-shooters for controlling a stampede never have been popular anywhere except in fiction . You do n't dash kerosene on a fire to put it out . George W. Saunders , gatherer of data for the two extraordinary volumes entitled The Trail Drivers of Texas , conducted a query among trail men as to the use of six-shooters in stampedes . He found only one man who had ever seen such use . A mob of riders yelling and helling after a stampede were generally as bad as a six-shooter . Jim Dobie , if he were present during a night stampede , had every man but one stay in camp . He wanted only one man to help him . Gus Withers and Ab Blocker had the same system . Running in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If crowded by numerous riders , all yelling , waving slickers , beating on their leggins and making as much noise as possible , they will cut off in bunches and scatter . Circling the leaders and throwing the herd into a mill was not the only way to stop a stampede . A few men who knew cow psychology and who felt in themselves a power over cattle could check the wildest running herd by riding in front , quavering out " The Texas Lullaby " and gradually getting the cattle to feel that the man and his ? horse were the leader , the dominator of the run . It took a born cowman to do this ? something entirely different from a mere expert at broncobusting and roping and shooting off his mouth or six-shooter. 126 He had to ride , nevertheless , " like a drunk Indian , " zigzagging across the front of the stampede and directing its course . A kind of chant that the master of a run might croon ? but never yodel ? to the cattle went somewhat in this wise : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wo-o-o-o-o-o-o boys . Be good , be good , wo-o-o-o-o , you wall-eyed rascals . . ( Expurgated ) So much has been written about the effect of cowboy songs on cattle that little need be said here . Singing , whistling , chanting , humming seemed to have a soothing effect on the toughest old Longhorns . Most of all , the sounds ? supposed to be harmonious ? prevented any sudden noise from startling the cattle . " It was cloudy in the west and a-lookin ' like rain " ? and the boss would say , " Boys , I reckon you 'll have to sing to ' em tonight . " Nearly all the old authentic cowboy tunes were slow , as slow as a horse walks around sleeping cattle at night , and the majority of them were mournful . Oh , beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly . Those words came low and mournfully . The music that hath power to soothe the savage breast is low ? and , yes , on the lone prairie , in the mouth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was sweet . They sang " Dan Tucker " until a horse would kick up his heels , and they sang " My Lulu Gal " with additions not to be printed , but they sang also " Nearer My God to Thee , " " The Old Time Religion , " " Jesus Lover of My Soul , " and " In the Sweet By and By . " " Old Hundred ' had a more soothing effect on wild cattle on the run than any other tune I knew , " one veteran recalled . Reed Anthony , Andy Adams ' cowman , tells how he and other Confederate soldiers guarding a herd of Texas steers saved the life of one because he would always walk out and stand attentive to the notes of " Rock of Ages " sung by his herders . Half of the tunes of genu-127 ine cowboy songs sound as if they had been derived from campmeeting hymns . The tune of " Jesse James " will make a sinner want to go to the mourners ' bench . And those old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd of devil-hardened steers . Cowboys used to say they could not sing " right " until the herd got restless ? but then they could pipe them back down to rest . Oh , say , little dogies , when are you goin ' to lay down And quit this forever s iftin ' around ? My horse is leg-weary and I 'm awful tired , But if you git away I 'm sure to git fired ? Lay down , little dogies , lay down . Some of the best known songs sung to prevent and to quiet stampedes were on that subject : " Little Joe the Wrangler , " whose horse fell just in front of the stampede and who was " mashed to a pulp " ; " Utah Carl , " who gave his life to save the boss 's daughter from " those cattle on a mad and fearless run " ; and " When Work 's All Done This Fall " ? a rough-hewn classic , though it takes memories and the tune to arouse connotations . While riding in the darkness so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and turn the herd about , His saddle horse did stumble and on him did fall ? The poor boy wo n't see his mother when the work 's all done this fall . And there was " Lasca , " by Frank Desprez , which many a lad who had never read a poem knew by heart , and which a generation ago was recited on Friday afternoons in country schoolhouses from Montana to the Gulf of Mexico . The air was heavy , the night was hot , I sat by her side and forgot , forgot ; Forgot the herd that were taking their rest , Forgot that the air was close oppressed , That the Texas norther comes sudden and soon , In the dead of the night or the blaze of noon ; 128 That , once let the herd at its breath take fright , Nothing on earth can stop their flight ; And woe to the rider , and woe to the steed , That falls in front of their mad stampede ! Was that thunder ? I grasped the cord Of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle and she clung behind . Away ! on a hot chase down the wind ... . The cattle gained on us , and , just as I felt For my old six-shooter behind in my belt , Down came the mustang and down came we , Clinging together ? and , what was the rest ? A body that spread itself on my breast , Two arms that shielded my dizzy head , Two lips that hard to my lips were prest ; Then came thunder in my ears , As over us surged the sea of steers , Blows that beat blood into my eyes , And when I could rise ? Lasca was dead ! I gouged out a grave a few feet deep , And there in the earth 's arms I laid her to sleep ; And there she is lying , and no one knows ; And the summer shines and the winter snows ; For many a day the flowers have spread A pall of petals over her head ; And the little grey hawk hangs aloft in the air , And the sly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glitters and slides Into the rift of a cottonwood tree ; And the buzzard sails on , And comes and is gone , Stately and still , like a ship at sea . And I wonder why I do not care For the things that are , like the things that were . Does half my heart lie buried there In Texas , down by the Rio Grande ? I29 J One more story , and I am done with stampedes . In its fidelity to that part of the good earth that was once the open range , in its simplicity and rhythm , and in its elemental power , it is perhaps the finest story that has ever been written about cows or cowboys ? " Longrope 's Last Guard , " by Charles M. Rus-sell. * " I 've read of stampedes that were sure dangerous an ' scary , where a herd would run through a camp , unsettin ' wagons an ' trompin ' sleepin ' cowpunchers to death . When day broke they 'd be fifty or a hundred miles from where they started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowpunchers an ' hosses , that looked like the work of a Kansas cyclone . This is all right in books , but the feller that writes ' em is romancin ' an ' do n't savvy the cow . Most stampedes is noisy , but harmless to anybody but the cattle . A herd in a bad storm might drift thirty miles in a night , but the worst run I ever see , we ai n't four miles from the bed-ground when day broke . " This was down in Kansas ; we 're trailin ' beef an ' have got about seventeen hundred head . Barrin ' a few dry ones , the herd 's straight steers , mostly Spanish Longhorns from down on the Cimarron . We 're about fifty miles south of Dodge . Our herd 's well broke an ' lookin ' fine , an ' the cowpunchers all good-natured , thinkin ' of the good time comin ' in Dodge . " That evenin ' when we 're ropin ' our hosses for night guard , the trail boss , Old Spanish ' we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he 's rode some in Old Mexico an ' can talk some Spanish L 130 ? says to me : Them cattle ought to hold well ; they ai n't been off water four hours , an ' we grazed ' em plumb onto the bedground . Every hoof of ' em 's got a paunch full of grass an ' water , an ' that 's what makes cattle lay good . ' " Me an ' a feller called Longrope 's on first guard . . . . When we reach the bed-ground , most of the cattle 's already down , lookin ' comfortable . They 're bedded in open country , an ' things look good for an easy night . It 's been mighty hot all day , but there 's a little breeze now makin ' it right pleasant ; but down the west I notice some nasty-lookin ' clouds hangin ' ' round the new moon that 's got one horn hooked over the skyline . The storm 's so far off that you can just hear her rumble , but she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm hopin ' she 'll go ' round . The cattle 's all layin ' quiet an ' nice ; so me an ' Longrope stop to talk awhile . " They 're layin ' quiet , ' says I. " Too damn quiet , ' says he . I like cows to lay still all right , but I want some of the natural noises that goes with a herd this size . I want to hear ' em blowin ' off , an ' the creakin ' of their joints , showin ' they 're easin ' themselves in their beds . Listen , an ' if you hear anything I 'll eat that rimfire saddle of yours ? grass rope an ' all . ' " I did n't notice till then , but when I straighten my ears it 's quiet as a grave . An ' if it ai n't for the lightnin ' showin ' the herd once in a while , I could n't ' a ' believed that seventeen hundred head of Longhorns lay within forty feet of where I 'm sittin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , an ' if it was n't for Longrope 's slicker I could n't ' a ' made him out , though he 's so close I could have touched him with my hand . Finally it darkens up so I ca n't see him at all . It 's black as a nigger 's pocket ; you could n't find your nose with both hands . " I remember askin ' Longrope the time . " I guess I 'll have to get help to find the timepiece , ' says he , but gets her after feelin ' over himself , an ' , holdin ' her under his cigarette , takes a long draw , lightin ' up her face . 131 " Half-past nine , ' says he . " Half an hour more , ' I says . Are you goin ' to wake up the next guard , or did you leave it to the boss-wrangler ? ' " There wo n't be but one guard to-night , ' he answers , an ' we 'll ride it . You might as well hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp . Well , I guess I 'll mosey ' round . ' An ' with that he quits me . " The lightnin " s playin ' every little while . It ai n't making much noise , but lights up enough to show where you 're at . There ai n't no use ridin ' . By the flashes I can see that every head 's down . For a second it 'll be like broad day , then darker than the dungeons of hell , an ' I notice the little fire-balls on my boss 's ears ; when I spit , there 's a streak in the air like strikin ' a wet match . These little fire-balls is all I can see of my boss , an ' they tell me he 's listenin ' always ; his ears are never still . " I tell you , there 's something mighty ghostly about sittin ' up on a boss you ca n't see , with them two little blue sparks out in front of you wigglin ' an ' movin ' like a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoss is usin ' his listeners plenty . I got my ears cocked , too , hearing nothin ' but Longrope 's singin ' ; he 's easy three hundred yards across the herd from me , but I can hear every word : Sam Bass was born in Injiana , It was his native home , ' T was at the age of seventeen Young Sam began to roam . He first went out to Texas , A cowboy for to be ; A better-hearted feller You 'd seldom ever see . " It 's so plain it sounds like he 's singin ' in my ear ; I can even hear the click-clack of his spur chains against his stirrups when he moves ' round . An ' the cricket in his bit ? he 's usin ' one of them hollow conchoed half-breeds ? she comes plain to me in 132 l the stillness . Once there 's a steer layin ' on the edge of the herd starts sniffin ' . He 's takin ' long draws of the air ; he 's nosin ' for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad sign ; it shows he 's layin ' for trouble , an ' all he needs is some little excuse . " Now , every steer , when he beds down , holds his breath for a few seconds , then blows off ; that noise is all right an ' shows he 's settlin ' himself for comfort . But when he curls his nose an ' makes them long draws , it 's a sign he 's sniffin ' for something , an ' if anything crosses his wind that he do n't like , there 's liable to be trouble . I 've seen dry trail herds mighty thirsty , layin ' good till a breeze springs off the water , maybe ten miles away ; they start sniffin ' , an ' the minute they get the wind you could comb Texas an ' would n't have enough punchers to turn ' em till they wet their feet an ' fill their paunches . " I get tired sittin ' there starin ' at nothin ' ; so I start ridin ' ' round . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I tell you by the way my hoss moves he 's feelin ' his way . I do n't blame him none ; it 's like lookin ' in a black pot . Sky an ' ground all the same , an ' I ai n't gone twenty-five yards till I hear cattle gettin ' up around me ; I 'm in the herd , an ' it 's luck I 'm singin ' an ' they do n't get scared . Pullin ' to the left , I work cautious an ' easy till I 'm clear of the bunch . Ridin 's useless ; so I flop my weight over on one stirrup an ' go on singin ' . " The lightnin " s quit now , an ' she 's darker than ever ; the breeze has died down , an ' it 's hotter than the hubs of hell . Above my voice I can hear Longrope . He 's singin ' the Texas Ranger ' now ; the Ranger 's a long song an ' there 's few punchers that knows it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me an ' I 'm interested . Seems like he 's on about the twenty-fifth verse , an ' there 's danger of his chokin ' down , when there 's a whisperin ' in the grass behind me ; it 's a breeze sneakin ' up . It flaps the tail of my slicker an ' goes by ; in another second she hits the herd . The ground shakes , an ' they 're all tannin ' . " My hoss takes the scare with ' em an " s bustin ' a hole in the 133 a darkness when he throws both front feet in a badger hole , goin ' to his knees an ' plowin ' his nose in the dirt . But he 's a good night hoss an " s hard to keep down . The minute he gets his feet under him he raises , runnin ' like a scared wolf . Hearin ' the roar behind him , he do n't care to mix with them locoed Longhorns . I got my head turned over my shoulder listenin ' , tryin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when there 's a flash of lightnin ' busts a hole in the sky ? it 's one of these kind that puts the fear of God in a man , thunder an ' all together . My hoss whirls an ' stops in his tracks , spraddlin ' out an ' squattin ' like he 's hit ; an ' I can feel his heart beatin ' agin my leg , while mine 's poundin ' my ribs like it 'll bust through . We 're both plenty scared . " This flash lights up the whole country , givin ' me a glimpse of the herd runnin ' a little to my left . Big drops of rain are poundin ' on my hat . The storm has broke now for sure , with the lightnin ' bombardin ' us at every jump . Once a flash shows me Longrope , ghostly in his wet slicker . He 's so close to me that I could ' a ' hit him with my quirt an ' I hollers to him , This is hell . ' " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder what damned fool kicked the lid off . ' " I can tell by the noise that they 're runnin ' straight ; there ai n't no clickin ' of horns . It 's a kind of hummin ' noise like a buzz-saw , only a thousand times louder . There 's no use in tryin ' to turn ' em in this darkness ; so I 'm ridin ' wide ? just herdin ' by ear an ' follerin ' the noise . Pretty soon my ears tell me they 're crowdin ' an ' comin ' together ; the next flash shows ' em all millin ' , with heads jammed together an ' horns locked ; some 's rared up ridin ' others , an ' these is squirmin ' like bristled snakes . " In the same light I see Longrope , an ' from the blink I get of him he 's among ' em or too close for safety , an ' in the dark I thought I saw a gun flash three times with no report . But with the noise these Longhorns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-heard a six-gun bark if I pulled the trigger myself , an ' the 134 next thing I know me an ' my boss goes over a bank , lightin ' safe . I guess it ai n't over four feet , but it seems like fifty in the darkness , an ' if it had n't been for my chin-string I 'd a-went from under my hat . Again the light shows me we 're in a ' royo with the cattle comin ' over the edge , wigglin ' an ' squirmin ' like army worms . " It 's a case of all night riding . Sometimes they 'll mill an ' quiet down , then start trottin ' an ' break into a run . Not till daybreak do they stop , an ' maybe you think old day ai n't welcome . My hoss is sure leg-weary , an ' I ai n't so rollicky myself . When she gets light enough , I begin lookin ' for Longrope , with nary a sign of him ; an ' the herd , you would n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ga'nt as greyhounds ; some of ' em with their tongues still lollin ' out from their night 's run . But sizin ' up the bunch , I guess I got ' em all . I 'm kind of worried about Longrope . It 's a cinch that wherever he is he 's afoot , an ' chances is he 's layin ' on the prairie with a broken leg . " The cattle 's spread out , an ' they begin feedin ' . There ai n't much chance of lolin " em , now it 's broad daylight ; so I ride up on a rise to take a look at the back trail . While I 'm up there viewin ' the country , my eyes run onto somethin ' a mile back in a draw . I ca n't make it out , but get curious ; so spurrin ' my tired hoss into a lope , I take the back trail . ' Tai n't no trouble to foller in the mud ; it 's plain as plowed ground . I ai n't rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' shows me this thing 's a floss , an ' by the white streak on his flank I heap savvy it 's Peon  --  that 's the boss Longrope 's ridin ' . When I get close he whinners pitiful-like ; he 's lookin ' for sympathy , an ' I notice , when he turns to face me , his right foreleg 's broke . He 's sure a sorry sight with that fancy , full-stamped , center-fire saddle hangin ' under his belly in the mud . " While I 'm lookin ' him over , my boss cocks his ears to the right , snortin ' low . This scares me ? I 'm afeared to look . Somethin ' tells me I wo n't see Longrope , only part of him ? that part 135 that stays here on earth when the man 's gone . Bracin ' up , I foller my hoss 's ears , an ' there in the holler of the ' royo is a patch of yeller ; it 's part of a slicker . I spur up to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mud is all there is left of Longrope . Pullin ' my gun , I empty her in the air . This brings the boys that are follerin ' on the trail from the bedground . Nobody 'd had to tell ' em we 'd had hell ; so they come in full force , every man but the cook an ' hoss-wrangler . " Nobody feels like talkin ' . It do n't matter how rough men are ? I 've known ' em that never spoke without cussin ' , that claimed to fear neither God , man , nor devil ? but let death visit camp an ' it puts ' em thinkin ' . They generally take their hats off to this old boy that comes everywhere an ' any time . He 's always ready to pilot you ? willin ' or not ? over the long dark trail that folks do n't care to travel . He 's never welcome , but you 've got to respect him . " It 's tough ? damned tough , ' says Spanish , raisin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his face with his neckhandkerchief , tender , like he 's feared he 'll hurt him . We find his hat tromped in the mud not fur from where he 's layin ' . His scabbard 's empty , an ' we never do locate his gun . " That afternoon when we 're countin ' out the herd to see if we 're short any , we find a steer with a broken shoulder an ' another with a hole plumb through his nose . Both these is gun wounds ; this accounts for them flashes I see in the night . It looks like , when Longrope gets mixed in the mill , he tries to gun his way out , but the cattle crowd him to the bank an ' he goes over . The chances are he was dragged from his hoss in a tangle of horns . " Some 's for takin ' him to Dodge an ' gettin ' a box made for him , but Old Spanish says : Boys , Longrope is a prairie man , an ' if she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster mother . She cared for him while he 's awake ; let her nurse him in his sleep . ' So we wrapped him in his blankets , an ' put him to bed . 136 " It 's been twenty years or more since we tucked him in with the end-gate of the bed-wagon for a headstone , which the cattle have long since rubbed down , leavin ' the spot unmarked . It sounds lonesome , but he ai n't alone , ' cause these old prairies has cradled many of his kind in their long sleep . " // To hearty Kate Stoner ( Mrs. Thomas ) O'Connor , contributor to Texas civilization , who in her ranch home gave me the idea for this chapter . Way down on Sam Bonello , Long time ago , Big black bull run down in the meader , Long time ago . He pawed up dust and then he beller , Long time ago , Shook his head and jarred the water , Long time ago . ? Negro song of a long time ago , South Texas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying utterly alone , others ranging together in small bunches , looking upon each other with lack-luster eye , hardly looking at cows at all , not one moved by the faintest intimation 139 of a dream from the sources of his bullhood . But by the time the grass was up high enough to afford whole mouthfuls , even the draggiest old bull had the feeling that the sun rose for his particular benefit , while at the same time the " shelliest " old cow shed her poverty-bedraggled hair and came into ambitions that made her forget the misery of suckling a calf on weak weed-tips in front of a February norther . A seasonable spring was becoming summer in some year be-fore 1890 . Any ranch in the southern half of Texas might be taken as the setting , but to please my own memories we 'll par-ticularize one on Ramirena Creek in the county of Live Oak , about the season when the wild turkeys began chasing grass-hoppers around sand-hill plums and the mustang grapes were big and hard enough for nigger-shooter bullets . A brindle bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his prowess , had been hanging around the Ramirez water hole for hours . His powerful neck showed a great bulge just behind the head . He had a big dewlap accenting his primeval origin . He had drunk but was by no means water-logged , for he belonged to a breed that knew what it was to drink only once every three days and then walk directly for hours back to grass . Over-eating or over-drinking would never allow those powerfully muscled foreparts and lithe flanks . Three or four other bulls were among the cattle , perhaps a hundred and fifty head , resting in the vicinity . But Brindle paid little attention to them . They knew their places and they re-garded him as impersonally as did the cows , heifers , calves and steers . A bull does not cut out a bunch of cows , herd them together and claim them for his own , as a stallion claims mares , fighting all other stallions away . His promiscuity destroys loyalty in both himself and the cows . He is free of the jealousy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dominion of a champion fighter of the range was territorial , the other bulls in that territory recognizing his prowess but being free 140 1 to go their own ways with any cows that showed them favor . A majority of the cattle this day at the Ramirez water hole were lying down or standing in the shade , out of sight of Brindle , chewing their cuds . Yet all , by the way they turned their heads and now and then ceased their cud-chewing to listen , indicated an interest in him ? the acknowledged bull of their woods . The woods consisted of prairie land running into and islanded with thorny thickets and of noble live oaks overtopping mesquites , hackberries , granjeno , brazil and other growth along the creek bottom . Brindle had been calling plenty of attention to himself . He seemed mad through and through , though it was not in his nature to vent his rage ? a rage sullen and reserved ? on just any member of society that got in his way . Utterly oblivious for the time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he went on nursing his wrath to keep it warm against some contester worthy of his mettle that might emerge from beyond the rim of his acknowledged domain . Having taken a position on a rise of open ground perhaps a hundred yards up from the water hole , he had for a long while been pawing dirt from an old bull-scrape in the soft soil ? a sink about like a buffalo wallow . He lifted the dirt with his forefeet so that it went high up in the air and fell in part upon his own back . While pawing , he often stopped to hook one of his horns ? the " master horn , " as Spanish bull-fighters call it ? into the ground , goring down to a kind of clayish damp that stuck to the tip . He even hooked both horns in , one at a time , and , kneeling , rubbed his shoulder against the bank of the wallow . At times the uplifted dirt from his flexible ankles came down in clumps and dust on tossing horns . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bellowsed out streams of breath that sprayed particles of earth away from his nostrils . Now , earth daubing his horns , matting his shaggy frontlet , and covering his back from head to tail , he was a spectacle . 141 1 But pawing and dirt-hooking were nothing compared to his vocal goings-on . When he came in to water , he was talking to himself , his truculent head swaying with the rhythm of his walk and the weight of his thick horns . Hoarse and deep , like thunder on the horizon , his mumbling talk went uh-uh-uh-uh , four deliberate notes , the last a low-descending jerk , in four steps . This was his war march . Often he stayed the throaty uh-uh-uh-uhing and halted to raise his head in a loud , high , de-fiant challenge that might be described as a basso-scream , com-bining a bellow from the uttermost profundities with a shriek high and foreign . Beside the water hole a fat two-year-old calico-colored heifer craved his attention , but only by a few curls and astounding twists of his upward-pointing nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her existence . His mind was on other things . Thus now , pawing up dirt , lunging his horn in as if to rip out the guts of the earth , bawling , bellowing , muttering , shat-tering the air , Brindle was sending his threats , his oaths of re-venge , his challenge to earth and hell , too , over the hills , against the echoing caliche cliffs on the far side of the Ramirena , and up a little canyon that emptied into the creek just above the water hole . As his fury waxed , he now and then let out in quick succession a series of far-carrying bawls , agonizing ? yet fascinating ? to human senses , for they seemed to be tearing the very lungs out of the bawler . Then at what seemed the zenith of this ecstasy of rage he heard something that infuriated the bottommost reserve of pas-sion . " He shook his head and jarred the water . " What he heard was an answer to his prayer , a response to his invitation , a defiance of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds were coming from the prairie divide be-tween Ramirefia and Lagarto creeks , the eager-for-battle maker of them having been lured from his trail to another watering . L 142 He could not be seen yet , but he was drawing nearer . Uh-uh-uh-ub , and then mighty throatings , growling a deep and hol-low roar . At length he came into view , a glossy dunnish-brown merging into black ? the golondrino ( swallow ) color ? white speckles and splotches on his rump and a washed-out copper line down his back . His thick horns , like Brindle 's , were set forward for tossing a lobo wolf into the air or ripping any kind of belly open as effectively as that scimitar-curved plebeian Mexican knife called saca tripas ( gets the guts ) . It was a belief that the bulls kept their horns sharpened for bloody work by rubbing them against trees and brush and whet-ting them in the ground . A hundred yards off , the golondrino bull stopped and went to pawing dirt , answering bellow for bellow . He not only gored the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cenizo bush and , jerking and twisting his head from side to side , broke the bush to stubble . He came nearer , but the preliminaries were long-drawn-out , each war-rior practising his thrusts , each seeming to wait for the other to take upon himself the war-guilt of the first assault , yet neither wearing himself out with exercise . This bullying was more than sound and fury ; back of it lay immense reserve . Brindle emerged from his wallow . Then he and Golondrino began to circle one another , each fronting his antagonist and maneuvering for an opening . They halted perhaps four yards apart . Meanwhile the other cattle had congregated , keeping well out of the way , and with sympathetic bawlings were adding to the atmosphere . Yet more cattle , attracted like boys to a dog-fight , came stringing in at a trot from far away . The big steers , which often seem to imagine themselves bulls and which no bull ever notices , were especially interested . Now the time for talk by the champions was over . The ob-ject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn , but each was a master of defense . At the simultaneous lunge that brought them together , the impact of skull against skull and horn against 143 horn made an air-shattering report like that when an iron-headed freight car is rammed into the iron of another car . Then , heads locked , the bulls stood planted in the soil , neither giving away to the other . Shoulder muscles stood out like bronze studies ; massive neck thews rose almost to the height of humps on Brahma bulls ; backs curved tensely , the downward sweep of line as beautiful in its grace and strength as any curve of nature that art ever revealed . One bull and then the other tried a quick side step to unbalance his opponent and get in a side thrust , but neither could win the advantage . With horns that were both weapon and shield , they parried strokes in such rapidity that the clashes could hardly have been counted . A turkey gobbler went to gobbling in his ridiculous way at each fresh impact of horns . The bulls backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went up into the air like a signal smoke . The ground they fought over was torn up as if giants with spikes and spades on their feet had wrestled there . The shovings , the head-on lunges , the dodges , the impregnable stands went on and on . The heat of the strain brought slobber to mouths , and tongues lolled out . Eyes , bloodshot , bulged forth . Once Brindle 's horn brought blood from a tear ? which , however , he was not allowed to take advantage of ? in Golondrino 's brisket . The smell of blood was caught by an old blue steer among the surrounding cattle and the blood cry went up and volumed in a discordant chorus . The throng of cattle now congregated were as uneasy and excited as a million robins gathered to migrate from the cedar brakes of the Colorado River to their summer homes on the Atlantic coast two thousand miles north . A coyote came to peer from behind a prickly pear bush up the ridge . The sun swung low . The wild turkeys disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up dust . Then with hearts still pumping against bursting lungs , they clashed again . Darkness came . 144 1 Often the battle was a draw , ending only from sheer ex-haustion on both sides . Once a bull realized he was outdone , he backed as if shot out of a catapult , wheeled with a loud snuff , and ran for life . If he ran fast enough , his opponent could at best merely hook him in the rump ? a spur to added swiftness . Let the victor get a side run at him , then he might knock him down and gore the vitals out of him . Death , while not frequent , was sometimes the end of a day-long battle . Against an old bull a young one had the advantage of en-durance ; cunning acquired from many experiences often gave victory to a waning bull pitted against some youngster with more strength and bravery than science . If this youngster was not killed , his day would come . He was acquiring experience . The whole activity ? aside from eating ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horns , is begetting calves ; at least half the activity of the Longhorn range bull was in battle . Fighting was the breath of life to him . Despite front attacks , I have never heard of a bull 's hooking his opponent 's eye out ? a tribute to parrying powers . A vaquero of other days told me that he once saw a wild bull gore another through the top of the neck . The horn went clear through that thickest part of the bull 's thick hide . It was so deeply twisted in and the hide was so unyielding that for a considerable time the bulls were fastened together not unlike bucks with interlocked antlers . Although it is not the nature of cattle to graze and move about at night like horses , the Longhorns were much more given to night activity than domesticated varieties . When bulls fought at night , then their bellowing and roaring , the bawling of other cattle , the hoarse howls of lobo wolves aroused by hope for a victim as they restlessly circled out from the fighters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prairie a truly weird character . It is impossible to convey sounds in print ? the wild , raucous 145 hair-raising sounds made by the old range bulls ; their growls ; their threats loud and deep that seemed to blast the earth ; their uplifted notes carrying like the finest coyote bark ; their expressions of pride and fury . But imagine them coming down a thicket or over the prairie grass in the deep night . All you can do is imagine . " The Spanish bull that used to water at the seep spring at the foot of the hill no longer makes the canyon roar with the echoes of his bellowing . " When a herd of cattle was rounded up from a wide-spreading range , thus bringing into proximity bulls that were strangers to one another , each of them a big frog in his own little puddle , there was sure to be raging and roaring , and fighting was inevitable unless the opponents were separated before they actually clashed horns . " Prayer meeting " was the name an old Negro hand used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' listen to ' urn testifyin ' , " he 'd say . A " prayer meeting " of this kind made working in a herd both difficult and dangerous . Any responsible cowman would break it up before zeal ran too high . At one fight that started in a herd , John Rigby saw a cow get in the way just at the moment the bulls simultaneously rushed at each other . One rammed his horns into her belly from one side and one from the other . She was lifted high up and came down dying . The worst danger of a fight was when one of the bulls decided to quit . His sole purpose then was to get away . Running from his opponent , he would have his eyes and attention on the brute behind him , trusting to his own power to get through or over any obstacle in front . Not many men had the f olhardiness to try to ride in to separate the fighters , for though a man might stop the fight , he was liable to be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cattle a short distance off from two engaged bulls , not keeping an eye on them , when suddenly one broke away , rammed into his horse , killing it and crippling him for life . 146 Ask any old-time range man of the south country to name the quickest animal he has ever known . He wo n't say a cutting horse , a polo pony , a wild cat , a striking rattlesnake . He does n't know the duck hawk . He will say a Longhorn bull . Some other bulls are quick ; many breeds fight , even the Polled Angus . But none of them can bawl , bellow , mutter and rage like the bulls of Spanish breed and none can move with such swiftness . I know of no contemporary photograph revealing a bull of the Texas Longhorns , on his own range , in the day of his dominion . A few American artists attempted him , but without the intimate knowledge or the power that vivify the canvases of Goya and lesser Spanish masters who glorified his forebears in multiplied attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest fighters of the taurine world , is , in its ancient and undiluted purity , still represented in the bull rings of Spain , Mexico and the Argentine . The bullfight the range people delighted in was on the range itself . Like scattered cattle , riders were often called to the battles from afar . Boys , usually without sanction from the profit-lusting cattle owners , would drive a proven champion to where he could meet a contester . On Sunday , sometimes quite an aggregation of boys and men would gather for a prearranged combat , bringing champions from distant areas to some watering place , where other cattle could add to the show . Voices as well as fighting power were highly regarded . At branding time any fighting ' sow 's bull-calf that demonstrated bravado , alacrity , strength and lusty lungs was likely to be branded and let loose uncastrated to make a fighting bull . If a bull decided he would not be driven from his range , no matter for what purpose , that was an end of the matter ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cattle . Yet not always . On the Stoner ranch in the Victoria , Texas , country there used to be a bull named Frank 147 1 Swift . He was called after the man who raised him , an individual with the habit of swallowing at one gulp a whole handful of the fiery little red Mexican peppers . Frank Swift was in color a dark dun running into white . Every once in a while he would be put in a herd bound for the shipping pens at Victoria , but he never got there . When he was ready to turn back , he turned ; and the only way to stop him would have been to shoot him . Of course his horns might have been chopped off and then he might have been necked to some powerful lead ox and dragged to the pens . After such punishment he would hardly have been worth the freight ? and certainly not the trouble . Once Frank Swift traveled to within sight of the pens , and the cowboys thought he was on his way sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed his mind about taking another step forward . He was the champion fighter and bellower of the country , and these virtues saved his life . The horn of a fighting bull has the penetrating power of a spike driven by a sledgehammer . " Many times , " says Ernest Hemingway in his treatise on bulls and bullfighting , Death in the Afternoon , " I have seen a bull attack the inch-thick wooden planks of the barrera with his horns , or horn rather , for he uses either the one or the other , and splinter the planks into bits . There is in the bull ring museum at Valencia a heavy iron stirrup that a bull perforated with a horn stroke to the depth of four inches . " No reader of the chapter on " The First Spanish Cattle " will have forgotten Colonel Philip Saint George Cooke 's account of the charge by wild bulls on the Mormon Battalion . Hemingway cites a Spanish work called Toros Celebres " which chronicles the manner of dying and the feats of some three hundred and twenty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a volume might be compiled on celebrated fighting bulls of the range . Afraid of nothing on earth , their bravery was almost unearthly . They not only joyed in combat with each other but 1148 J sought combat with other beasts and with man himself . Nat Straw , grizzly hunter of New Mexico , told me that he was in the Black Range when cattle , Longhorns from Texas , were introduced in that region . Then , he said , the grizzly bear ? Ursus horribilis ? met the first living beast , the bull , it had ever known that would not give way to it . Jack Thorp and another cowboy were chousing horses up the bed of Sacramento River , in New Mexico , one day when they came upon a red Longhorn bull , about six years old , that they both knew well ; each had more than once given him the trail as he came down to water . " As we rode around him now , " Jack Thorp related , " and saw him standing so quiet , we noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hair hanging down from his back just behind the shoulders . His foreparts were badly clawed . Both horns were covered with dried blood . " About halfway up the steep trail was a flat ? a little bench ? at a sharp turn . Here the horses ahead of us snorted and broke away into the brush . Jumping ahead to turn them back , we noticed how the shin-oak over a big patch of ground had been broken down and the earth turned up . Then I found a monstrous grizzly , lying across a fallen log , his entrails strung out on the ground and his hair matted with dried blood . The bull , even if he did n't come off unmarked , had very plainly horned this griz-zly bear to death . Yes , that Longhorn bull got well all right , but being one-eyed kind of cramped his style .
