txt BOARD LESSENS COAL PAY SCALE ; MOVE FOR PEACE WEEKLY WAGE RISE 7-to-5 Decision Rejects Illinois Pact , but It Backs Travel Time OVERTIME KEY TO RULING Striking Miners Are Told to Return by Tomorrow or the Case Will Go to President By 0 . P. TRUSSELL Special to Tam Nine ' Sous Trues . WASHINGTON , Oct. 28 ? The National War Labor Board by a 7 to 5 decision rejected tonight the terms of the September wage agreement between the Illinois Coal Operators Association and the United Mine Workers of America , but proposed a plan under which the miners , by submitting to a reduction from $8.50 to $8.12% of the daily basic wage agreed upon , could raise their earnings as much as $10 a week by increasing production through overtime work . At the same time the board , surveying a strike in which 40,000 miners remained idle in seven States , served notice upon John L. Lewis and other " WAWA officials that if the strikes did not cease by Thursday morning the situation would be referred immediately to President Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which the strikes persisted , it was conceded generally , would mean reseizure by the Government of the mines involved . Travel Time Formula " Upheld In dealing with the Illinois agreement , involving 25,000 to 30,000 miners and looked upon as a possible pattern for adjustments throughout the industry , the board accepted its principles in seeking a method of paying portal-toportal wages and increasing the workday to eight and a half hours including travel time . The decision suggests a method of its own by which , it was explained by William H. Davis , chairman , travel time could be paid under the Fair Labor Standards Act , though not under the Wage Stabilization Program . Assuming on the basis of figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that the average travel time per day between the portal and the coal face was 45 minutes , the board majority brought out that productive time in an 83,4-hour day would amount to 7% hours and explained its decision as follows : " Under the old contract , the compensation for this amount of productive time would be 8.125 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and time and onehalf for 45 minutes ) . On the base rate of $1 an hour this would amount to $8.121 ; 2 . " The new Illinois agreement proposes to pay for the eight and onehalf hours , including travel time , a base rate of $8.50 . This is a daily wage increase of 371. cents and is therefore 371/2 cents a day more than the board is able to approve under the limitations of the Act of Congress and the Executive orders and directive issued pursuant thereto . " The board could approve a daily wage of $8.121 but not more . Follow Wage-Hours Law " When we turn to the overtime provisions of the proposed Illinois agreement we find that they follow the statutory provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act . For Mine workers who work more than forty hours a week thi- " ' wolves a wage increase of half time for two and a half hours of the fifth day of work , but under any true portal-to-portal system in which travel time is included in working time the result follows as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is , in the present case , the amount that the operators have to pay to relieve themselves of any further liability under the Fair Labor Standards Act . We have already held that payments made to satisfy the requirements of that act , if they are truly related to these requirements , may be approved . The provisions of the proposed Illinois agreement as to overtime are exactly fitted to the Fair Labor Standards Act and we can therefore approve them . " The total effect of what we can // BOARD MODIFIES - ILLINOIS MINE PACT // approve amounts to a Very substantial increase of the mine workers ' weekly wage so long as the miners work more than forty hours a week . Figured on the basic hourly rate of $1 , the total weekly earnings of the mine workers under the Illinois agreement , modified to reduce the basic daily wage from $8.50 to $8.12% , would be increased over the 1941-43 agreement by approximately $10 per week from about $45.50 to about $55.50 per week . " The total weekly hours for a six-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( forty-six and a half hours productive time and four and a half hours travel tine ; ) , compared with forty-two hours productive time under the 1941-43 agreement . " The wage increase of approximately 25 cents a day as resulted from the wage adjustment heretofore approved by the War Labor Board for the bituminous coal miners is included in these figures . The actual average earnings are about 8 to 10 per cent above these earnings figured on the basic rate because most miners get a higher hourly rate than the base rate . " From the board 's statement on actual average earnings , it was remarked that for a miner who worked six days a week his earnings really would be about $60 . A further reference was made by the board to fixing average travel time . " We are willing to do this , " the majority decision stated , " even though the present travel time may somewhat exceed this amount , because we are convinced that when travel time is paid for , the economic inducement imposed on the operators will lead them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers have , in their submission of the proposed Illinois agreement , expressed their willingness to have the operators reduce the travel time as much as they can if adequate facilities are provided in connection with any newly opened portals. , " The beneficial effects of such contract , " the majority decision said , " would be to make available to the mine workers a considerable amount of overtime , thereby making fuller use of the limited available manpower , increasing the weekly earnings of the miners , increasing the production of bituminous coal which the country so badly needs , and disposing of the portal to portal controversy . " This would be accomplished by applying to the mine workers ' wages the same yardsticks that have been used in measuring wage adjustments for all other wage earners without discriminatory advantage or disadvantage and without unstabilizing general viage levels . " For outside employes , including strip mine and coke oven employes , the Illinois agreement ' provided for an eight-hour day with time and one-half for the eighth hour . For outside employes ; such as maintenance workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work day of eight hours and twenty minutes was provided , with straight time for the first eight hours and twenty minutes of overtime pay . The board found that such adjustments could be- approved . No comment upon the decision I came tonight from the UMWA . Previously , Mr. Lewis had said that if the board approved the Illinois agreement in the form in which it was submitted in September , he would work for its application throughout all producing regions . Supporting the decision were the four public members of the board , Mr. Davis , George W. Taylor , Wayne L. Morse and Frank P. Graham , and three of the four members representing industry , George H. Mead , George K. Batt and Horace B. Horton . The fourth industry member , Almon E. Roth , dissented , holding that the agreement should have been rejected completely because the miners had submitted no data on travel time or portal-to-portal pay . Dissenting as a group were the four labor members , George Meany , Robert J. Watt , Van ' A. Bittner and John Brophy.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
