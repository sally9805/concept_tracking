The Labor Government found itself in the middle of a rip-roaring open-shop v. closed-shop fight last week . On the open-shop side hovered management and Britain 's bevy of small , independent unions . On the closed-shop side hulked the big unions . The issue : Can the Government , of which the big unions are the mainstay , use its powers to enjoin the closed shop ? <P> The swinging started over a dozen individualistic tram conductors , members of the small Passenger Workers ' Union . They had staunchly refused to join the big Transport &; General Workers ' Union . Just as the Labor Government lifted wartime restrictions on the transport and mining industries , the big union issued a growling ultimatum to the trolleymen 's employer , the London Passenger Transport Board : either the twelve must be fired , or all of London 's buses would stop . The Board capitulated . But the Passenger Workers ' Union forthwith prepared to fight for an injunction against the men 's dismissal . Unless the injunction was granted , thousands of other independent union members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Replied London 's Laborite Daily Herald : " The majority can not risk being perpetually at the mercy of the minority . " <P> The powerful National Union of Mine Workers gave the Labor Government another bad turn last week when it elected Arthur Horner as its General Secretary . Horner is a Communist . But so well do the miners like him that they elected Horner only three months after they had flatly rejected affiliation with the Communist Party . Even Ernie Bevin and Herbert Morrison were prepared to admit that Horner was an efficient union leader and a nice chap . But , they fretted , " we wish he was n't a Communist . "
