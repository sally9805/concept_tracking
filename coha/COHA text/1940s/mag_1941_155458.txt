Plodding picket lines have become so common of late years that the average U. S. citizen scarcely cocks an eye at them . But Detroit last week saw a picket line that tied up traffic . Up &; down in front of dingy American Lady Corset Co. factory , in freezing weather , paraded six women . Four , husky and broad-beamed , wore corsets over their street clothes . The other two , streamlined company models , just wore corsets . What they were demanding : a closed shop , higher wages . All they had got at week 's end : publicity , three fan letters , and a one-dollar bill from an admirer who hoped that willowy Model Georgia Ray would use it to buy herself a pair of bloomers.
