MONUMENTAL GRANDEUR OF THE MISSISSIPPI SHOWN IN A MAGNIFICENT SCENIC MIRROR COVERING 15,000 FEET OF CANVAS , ILLUSTRATING THE SPLENDID SCENES THAT OCCUR UPON THE FATHER OF RIVERS . <P> <P> That attraction , advertised in facsimiles of century-old handbills , was just one of the highlights of a show that jammed the St. Louis City Art Museum last week . A " Mississippi Panorama " of 347 paintings , prints and riverboat models and mementos , the exhibition had been put together by bustling 38-year-old Museum Director Perry Rathbone , who first thought of it while he was serving in a New Caledonia naval base during the war . " I was suffering from a strong attack of nostalgia , " Rathbone explains . His idea was to " reveal the look and character of the mid-continent 's waterways and of the life they created and sustained in the 19th Century . " <P> Myths &; Marvels . Every half-hour a small group of museum visitors was ushered into a gallery that had been made over to look like a gimcracked Victorian theater . The antique chandelier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( which Rathbone had found in the University of Pennsylvania Museum cellar ) was slowly unrolled . Painted on muslin , it showed the myths and marvels of the Mississippi valley as sketched or imagined by one Dr. Montroville W. Dickeson , a Burton Holmes of the 1850s , and executed by the " eminent Irish artist " John J. Egan . What Egan 's effort lacked in accuracy and technique was more than made up for by its scope and unfailing liveliness . It was a rare example of a recent but lost art , as far removed from the modern as New Caledonia is from the Mississippi . <P> The exhibition spanned a century , from the meticulous White Hall Plantation painted by Christophe Colomb about 1800 , to a mist-shrouded painting of the river at night , done in 1905 by Frederick Oakes Sylvester . Between the two were a handful of great and near-great artists : naturalist-painters such as John James Audubon , Missouri 's George Caleb Bingham who immortalized the river 's roistering flatboatmen , and Indian Painters Charles Bodmer and George Catlin . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arouse the same " strong attack of nostalgia " that had inspired Rathbone to stage it . To conservatives who might question the art quality of the packet-boat china , menus and bills of lading that Rathbone had interspersed among the river canvases , Showman Rathbone had a commonsense reply : " The first job is to get the people into our museums . The future of art belongs to them and not to the recherche group of the last century . The age of the private patron is gone , and the mass support required to take its place must be preceded by mass appreciation . " <P> Director Rathbone seemed to be getting the mass appreciation . At week 's end , visitors were packing into his museum at a faster rate than at any time since last winter , when 228,000 came to see the traveling exhibit of Berlin art masterpieces . Rathbone 's exhibit was also getting huzzas from other museum men . Said a visiting expert from Louisiana : " It should be shown in every city on the Mississippi River .
