Waksman , streptomycin 's discoverer , produced a sister drug named grisein from the same soil organism . Grisein 's job : to knock out ( with the help of streptomycin ) bacteria that develop a resistance to streptomycin alone . <P> Streptomycin still looks like the most promising foe of tuberculosis , but Dr. Alfred Marshak of the U.S. Public Health Service found another likely-looking one : a yellow crystal extracted from California Spanish moss ( not to be confused with the lacy Spanish moss that hangs from trees ) .
