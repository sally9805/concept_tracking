As 1,300 U.S. Rotarians and their families descended on Rio de Janeiro last week for the 39th International Convention , Rio 's cariocas braced themselves for the worst . They had seen U.S. conventioneers in the movies-Shriners in outlandish costumes and rowdy , boisterous Legionnaires . Shopkeepers hopefully put " Welcome , Rotary " signs in their windows , fearfully wondered if they should board them up . <P> But the Rotarians let them down . Staid , stout and respectable , they ignored the hotspots , loosed not a wolf whistle . Festooned with cameras and shopping bags , they took the funicular to Sugar Loaf mountain , gazed at the Christ of Corcovado , swarmed into the curio shops to buy butterfly trays and carved knickknacks . <P> In the unseasonably humid Brazilian fall , the men sweated damply in woolen suits or sported open-necked shirts and cruise clothes . Their wives , dressed in everything from purple voile to tweeds , seemed positively dowdy to Rio , where the " New Look " has swept skirts down almost to the ankle . In the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Rotarians from 37 countries , listened to Senior Statesman Oswaldo Aranha address them in Portuguese . " I can just feel what he 's saying , " gushed a Rotary wife . <P> After five days , the Rotarians departed , leaving Rio pleased , relieved , and vaguely disappointed . The cariocas had expected antics and amusement , maybe a few Lana Turners and Betty Grables . Instead they had seen middleaged , middle-class North America . Said a Rio hairdresser wistfully : " They were very nice-but so plain . "
