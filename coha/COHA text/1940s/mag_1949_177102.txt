Criss Cross ( Universal International is fairly routine gangster melodrama in which the hero ( Burt Lancaster ) is led into a whole mess of trouble by his alluring ex-wife ( Yvonne de Carlo ) . But it is sharply directed by Robert Siodmak and enlivened with some fresh bits of business . Samples : a jug-nursing old gentleman ( Alan Napier ) who makes a specialty of planning complex holdups ; the robbery of an armored car ( in which Lancaster is a guard ) , a rare sport among real-life or cinema crooks ; so much double-crossing that the cast almost needs military maps to remind them who is on whose side at any given moment . <P> Criss Cross is further brightened by some excellent supporting performances . The best are Stephen McNally 's detective , Dan Duryea as a sarcastic thug who seems to have more common sense than anyone else in the cast , and Tom Pedi as a fat , greedy hoodlum who bubbles " That 's the ticket , that 's the ticket , " while the mob is planning some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovers , Lancaster and De Carlo steadily plug the reliable old theme of **36;735;TOOLONG . Audiences are not very likely to be convinced that their particular world was much to lose . <P> Cover Up ( United Artists ) is a doubtful little melodrama with a doubtful moral thesis : murder is excusable when the victim is an unpopular curmudgeon . The film 's makers avoid an out &; out tussle with the Johnston Office by killing off the murderer , a kindly old doctor , before Insurance Investigator Dennis O'Keefe can catch up with him . But , preoccupied with Dennis ' courtship of a suspect 's daughter ( Barbara Britton ) , they blithely overlook the fact that a local banker was an accessory to murder and that Sheriff William Bendix shut his eyes to the crime . The rather whimsical reward for all this tampering with justice : Dennis gets the girl . <P> A Woman 's Secret ( RKO Radio ) might better have been kept under lock &; key . Producer Herman J. Mankiewicz , a veteran scripter who should have known setter , scraped this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jarrel of slick fiction . <P> The story is about a Tin Pan Alley tunesmith ( Melvyn Douglas ) who gets caught in some badly directed crossfire between two Manhattan songbirds ( Maureen O'Hara and Gloria Grahame ) . When Maureen suddenly loses her voice , she and Douglas discover Gloria , a seductive salesgirl with a gold-plated larynx . Under their high-pressure salesmanship , Gloria 's voice soon belongs to a radio network , a gilded Manhattan nightclub and the admiring U.S. public . But Gloria is not easy to manage . She is finally the victim of a shooting scrape that lands Maureen in the clink and then in a fadeout clinch with Douglas . It is never made entirely clear what all the shooting is about . <P> This indigestible lump of melodrama is leavened now &; again by a stretch of slapstick which is equally unreal . The only real moments , in fact , are provided by Gloria Grahame , who proves once again , as she did by her performance as the sullen taxi dancer in Crossfire , that she can be one of Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
