We Do n't Know A Story by Peter De Vries F txtrro east from Chicago not long ago , I sat next to a man who was returning , as I gathered when I engaged him in conversation  --  or rather when he engaged me  --  from some sort of ornithological expedition . He was short , red-haired , and deeply tanned , plump but in a compact and leathery way , and dressed in brown tweed . A line of mustache , thin as a cat-scratch , ran across his upper lip . Though I listened at first with only half an ear , being absorbed in a thunderhead visible from the window where I was sitting , I managed to keep a fair grip on the subject he had laid down , which had to do with migratory feats . As I was giving a last glance back at the cloud , put , it appeared , safely behind , he dropped a remark that recovered my full attention . " We do n't know where plovers rest between the Alaskan coast and Hawaii , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain past which I had been peering . . " We do n't ? " I said . He shook his head . " We have n't the faintest idea , " he said . " We do n't see where they can set down in all the thousands of miles of open sea that stretch between their breeding ground and the islands where they winter . " It was one of those technical discussions in which I knew my own role would be mainly that of listener , with an occasional question , intelligent if possible . .1 waited for him to go on . " The problem of rest is easy for some birds ? they can sit on the water . But not yourgolden plover , " he said . " He gets waterlogged . " The thought drew him into sober reflection , as it did me . Finally , though , I felt it was time I responded with a question . " What are some more that get waterlogged ? " was all I could think of . He unbuckled his safety belt , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooty tern , for instance , neither swims nor dives , and how he parks on the unbroken ocean is another thing we wonder . Some rest on flotsam , I 'll grant you , and we do know that the noddy tern occasionally uses the head of a floating pelican for a perch . " " Come on , " I said with an open skepticism born of having instinctively taken it from the pelican 's point of view . " Are we positive ? " He said we were , on the strength of reports deemed reliable . He got off into statistics on migratory punctuality . " The greater yellowlegs leave Patagonia for the Canadian muskegs , a sphagnum bog up there , a distance of eight to ten tholisand miles , hatching their first eggs without fail between the twenty-sixth and the twenty-ninth of May , inclusive --  " I grew restive in the spate of facts . " What else do n't we know ? " I asked . " What are some other things we wonder ? " He bent up a knee and clasped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Atlantic plover reach ' a destination they have never seen , the Argentine , where one branch of the family regularly winter , and which they must find alone , since they 're abandoned by their parents at the feeding ground , " he said . " We wonder especially --  I never got what we wonder especially , because just then we were suddenly enveloped by lightning , bounced violently up and down and slapped sideways by spats of wet . I fumbled for my safety belt even before the instruction to fasten it flashed up front ; but it did n't seem to faze him , " Then there 's that uncanny thing , the homing instinct . " He buckled his belt after a pedagogical glare from the stewardess . " Your theory that they make their way back by landmarks is out , because then how could they stay on the beam after dark ? " lie put to me curtly , as though routing a myth I would be presumed to hold . Not only do they return to the identical island  --  they set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making a pinpoint landing that would put this thing to scorn . Do you know what our latest theory is ? " I shook my head , conscious only that we were churning steadily into more agitated zones . That some nerves in their wings  --  get this  --  some nerves in their wings act as radar detectional antennae . to relate them to latitude as one co-ordinator , and the lines of magnetic force in the earth as the other . " He gave a philosophical shrug . " But then do we know what magnetic force is ? " Out of the tail of my eye , I had become aware that at least one of our own wings was garnished with a light glow that remained . I pointed a thumb at it over my shoulder . " Do we know what that is ? " I asked . He leaned past me to get a look at it . " Oh , " he said , " St. Elmo 's fire . Yes . Static electricity that may gather on the wings of a plane in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are we sure ? " I asked . " Positive . I once took a noddy tern , banded for identification , to Shreveport , " he said , getting back to the homing instinct . " Several hundred miles from where he belonged . In four days he was back in his mating area . " " One good tern deserves another , " I jabbered as a fresh flash of lightning drew a nervous giggle from me . He gave me a sharp glance of appraisal . " This thing is airborne . It bobs up and down just as a boat does on the water , " he said . " There are two flight principles ! that of the goose , which must use his wings againstthe air , to overcome gravity by sheer effort , and that of , say , the gull , which gives his wings to the air , letting the currents carry him . 1 ? other words , the airplane and the glider . These two principles . When we set out in a glider , we 're a gull . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated with a wave at the laboring motors , " we 're a goose . " You 're telling me , I thought as we dropped what seemed fifty feet into another air pocket . " What were we then ? " I asked , gripping the seat with my eyes closed . I do n't know what he said because just then we went back up with a snap , like a yo-yo . " Then ca n't geese glide ? " I asked trying to affect his conversational air , but it ended in another spasm of unstable mirth . He turned away , whether out of disgust or resentment I did n't know . He just crossed his legs into the aisle and pulled a newspaper out of his coat pocket . I had the uneasy feeling he thought I had been picking his brains frivolously , and wanted to make amends . " About this homing instinct , " I said presently , with a inure sober show of interest in the subject . " Did n't I read something new and revolutionary about that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides what I just said ? " he asked , putting the paper back and looking at me sharply . When I answered , hazily , that I thought so but could n't recall exactly , he seemed irked . " Where did you read it ? " he demanded . I had to answer that I was sorry , but 1 could n't remember that either . Probably some magazine . It had been a remark of the kind one drops to stay in a discussion ; but it was something I was swiftly to regret  --  even though , in the turn of events that followed , it helped afford me an illuminating glimpse into his obsession with the unknown . DEFECTIVE oil pump kept us indefinitely in Cleveland . We sought out a tavern , and furthered our acquaintance over a few drinks . His name was Ammidown . When we had been served our first , he drank , shoved aside an ashtray , and folded his hands on the table . " Look , I do n't suppose you 've ever heard of Synonymy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syllable , it was a moment before I properly connected it with " synonym , " and then only by visualizing the spelling . " No , I have n't , " I said . " What is it ? " Synonymy is the record of all names given to species and other groups , both correct and incorrect ; so that a naturalist , say , who thinks he has fetched up a new species and goes ahead and names it , only to find that it has already been discovered and named , gets his boner entered just as officially as he would have had his triumph . Nor is it necessary to blunder on that scale ; the slightest violation of an extremely complicated protocol governing nomination , and the name is discreditably " placed in Synonymy , " " relegated to Synonymy , " or " thrown in Synonymy " ( depending on the degree of shame intended ) by the International Commission on Nomenclature , with whom the guilty naturalist is then in the doghouse . " I have a friend who just caught Synonymy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had bought . " You have ? " I said . " Who is he , a colleague or something ? " He chewed rapidly for some moments . " It does n't matter who he is , " he said , looking away too casually to leave any doubt in my mind the dunce cap was on himself . " Fellow did a job with a little-known sub-species in the Pacific . Brilliant job . Took skill , perseverance , even courage . But --  " He sighed and pulled an ear-lobe . " We already knew it . His name was thrown in Synonymy . " We both sat a moment without speaking , as though observing a respectful silence . " That 's the way it is , " he said . " One slip and it 's humble pie . " We drank simultaneously , looking in different directions . He drew wet marks with his glass . " How long will he have to eat it ? " I asked softly . " How long will his name stay in Synonymy ? " He broke a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I began drawing wet marks of my own . Presently he straightened and spanked the crumbs from his hands . " Well , what I 'm pitching into now is some experiments with homing behavior , which you said you read something about ? A big advance in data was made by Army personnel , who found carriers better than radio for somethings. and the Racing Pigeons Association . The ornithologists wo n't have any part of it because they consider the sources beneath them  --  especially the Racing Pigeons Association . Well , I do n't . " He narrowed his eyes with a look of resolve , and ground his jaws . " And . / think I 'm on the track of something . Of course it makes you break out in a cold sweat to think it 's already been dune . For a while all this chap could do was drink . And that he has n't been back to the club since , goes without saying . " He twitched his chair more squarely opposite mine . " What was in that article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I reproached myself , instead of popping out with the first thing that comes into it just to keep in the conversation ? " Oh , it was probably nothing worth worrying about , " I said , desperately attempting to clarify my associations in terms of his comments on carrier pigeons , which had , again , dimly rung a bell . " You know how those things blur together in a layman 's mind . Probably something I read in a dentist 's office . " The thought of what a naturalist might catch for filing information available in a frazzled copy of the Reader 's Digest must have struck us simultaneously , for just as it crossed my mind I thought he shuddered in his chair and looked away . " You never know when something new may turn up , especially in a newspaper , " he said . He leaned toward me with his elbows on the table again . " I want you to think hard . Was it , " he asked with eyes that haunt me still , " the article in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T answered was again the first thing that came into my head , but though n may have been a bit dishonest , I had no feeling it was dishonorable . " That was it ! " I said , trusting that a foggy recollection of a several-page spread with lots of pictures , together with the obvious relief from nervous tension this announcement produced , justified the exclamation Anyhow I thought it sate to assume that anybody with a history of Synonymy would keep frenetically posted , and he did n't appear to know of anything else on the subject . " Except for something the Journal of Applied Physics ran about the same time , " he said . - Well , it 's a cinch I did n't read it there , " I said with a laugh , and he laughed too , and the glimpse of his face , as he sat hack , was like seeing the Fasten Your Belt sign go off . T HE defective pump was replaced , and the rest of the flight was uneventful . We both rode the airline limousine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took leave of each other on the sidewalk there . " Goodby , " I said , putting out my hand . " I hope your experiments are a success . And tell your friend not to feel too bad about the Synonymy . It could happen to anybody . " " Well , you 're right there , " he said as , smiling , he shifted his grip to take my hand . " Good by and good luck . " " Yon too , " I said , and made off through the crowd . . I got a cab first , and as it nosed its way into the traffic , I looked for him through the window . He was at the curb trying to flag one himself . He caught sight of me and waved . I waved back , and as my cab shot away and I lost him from view , I wondered what it is he 's on the track of , hoping , with him , as I still do , that it 's something we do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working all by himself , is today an unproductive anachronism . A single laboratory , keeping its results within its own walls , will soon find itself out of date . A single nation , keeping its research secret , will inevitably fall behind . For research is essentially a collaborative effort . This has been said before , but it needs to be said again and again . . . . One of the crucial experiments concerning the nature of the meson was carried out by a young Italian in Rome just after its liberation . This young man is now in this country , but he of course can not be " cleared " to work on atomic research of military importance . The most exciting experiment in nuclear physics this year was the creation of mesons by the huge Berkeley cyclatron , a collaborative experiment carried out by a Brazilian and an American . If it should turn out that the results have military value the Brazilian would then and there be disbarred from continuing . . . . At present no adequate course in nuclear engineering can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret . Courses are given to properly cleared people at the various atomic energy laboratories , but this is a poor substitute for the well integrated course which a university could give . Besides , how is one to attract the best minds if one can not tell them what it 's all about until they commit themselves ? . . What is the answer ? I do n't believe it is the other extreme , that of complete freedom of exchange of ideas . Not just now , though some thoughtful persons believe we would gain more than we would lose . / believe we can reach a not-too-crippling compromise for the present by choosing a few crucial subjects which are to be kept secret and by declaring the other fields open . The separation is not difficult ; the engineering and technical details concerning the bomb itself can be kept secret , just as design details of many other weapons are kept secret . Data on the properties of uranium , for instance , could be reported openly , without disclosing the secrets of the bomb , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secrets of electric torpedoes . The fundamental facts of nuclear science , the results of pure research , must be open to free discussion . ? From an address by Dr. Philip McCord Morse at the Herald Tribune Forum .
