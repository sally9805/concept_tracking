At 4 p.m. on Nov. 11 , the eve of China 's National Assembly , five middle-aged men waited in the reception room of a snug , red brick house in Nanking . Five nonpartisan moderates , they had come-in a political atmosphere taut as a ripe boil-to seek audience with Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek , at his home . <P> The Gissimo greeted them gravely , served tea and cakes . Then , in behalf of China 's middle-road parties , they presented a petition : would the Generalissimo postpone the Assembly until Dec. 1 , in the hope that all parties might be persuaded to attend ? The Gissimo said no-impossible . The nonpartisans politely persisted . Finally Chiang Kai-shek said : " Gentlemen , you have the interests of China at heart . You are nonpartisans . ... Go back to your colleagues . Test their opinions again . Find out if they will really join the Assembly should postponement be arranged . " <P> That night the middle-aged delegates-a diplomat , a newspaper publisher , an educator , a historian and an industrialist-hurried from group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . <P> Carson Chang 's Rightist Social Democrats said perhaps . Dr. Lo Lung-chi 's left-wing adherents were noncommittal . Back at the red house , the poll takers reported . The Generalissimo listened , then ordered a postponement-not for three weeks but three days . Unhappily , but feeling they could do nothing else , the five registered for the Assembly , cracked the united front of China 's " third parties " against it . <P> New Start . On the morning of Nov. 15 the delegates crowded into the grey stone Assembly building on Kuo Fu Road . The Generalissimo and Mme. Chiang entered almost unnoticed by a side door . But among the drably clad provincials were some colorful figures : a Tibetan delegate , in bright-hued robes ; the towering Catholic prelate , Archbishop Paul Yu-pin ; little , rotund Publisher Hu Lin of China 's foremost paper , Ta Rung Pao ; brisk Premier T. V. Soong ; and chubby Dr. Sun Fo , son of the Republic 's founder , Sun Yatsen . The Communists were missing . <P> There was little gaiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 695 out of a specified 2,050 ) . They listened quietly and attentively as Chiang spoke , in a high , springy voice . Concluding his injunction to delegates to adopt a constitution that " embodies both ideals and realities , " Chiang said : <P> " If we try to place the cause for the political turmoil of the present day and also the sufferings of the people , we find that these are all due to the absence of the foundation of the state , and the present adoption of a constitution is a vital step toward stabilizing the foundation ... and inaugurating constitutional democracy . . . . " <P> When the delegates met again , they would seek the foundation in the constitutional draft originally prepared for the 1937 Assembly , which was shelved by the Japanese invasion . Retaining the present five divisions of government ( executive , legislative , judicial , control and examination ) , the constitution would supplant one-party appointees with elected officials , eventually bring China universal suffrage .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
