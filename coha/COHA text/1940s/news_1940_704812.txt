txt FOR 2-OCEAN NAV ) Bill Is Rushed to House on Recommendation of Admiral Stark COST OF 4 BILLIONS Roosevelt Has a Plan for Broad National Service by All By HAROLD B. HINTON Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES . WASHINGTON , June 18 ? Admiral Harold R. Stark , chief of naval operations , today recommended to the House Naval Affairs Committee a $4,000,000,000 naval expansion bill designed to give this country a navy adequate to defend each of its coasts and all of its possessions , and six hours later the committee , acting by unanimous vote , sent such a bill to the House . Dramatically and without previous announcement of his plans , the Admiral laid before the committee a program which would authorize the building by 1946 of a navy larger than any world power ever has possessed . It would represent some 750 fighting ships of a total of 3 , - 760,000 tons . In approving Admiral Stark 's program , which would involve a 70 per cent increase in the nation 's sea strength , the committee scrapped a bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter would have authorized a 24 per cent naval expansion at a cost of $1,200,000,000 . The speed with which naval officials and the House committee acted was regarded as representing a sudden new realization of the need of even greater measures to implement the military and economic defense of the Western Hemisphere to the end that the armed might and the political theories of totalitarian governments shall not prevail against the ideals of the countries of the North and South American continents . French Defeat the Cause The Navy 's abrupt change of front was one of several indications that the full import of the French situation had struck the national capital , and that plans for the military and economic defense of the Western hemisphere would be promptly doubled and perhaps redoubled . It appeared that all thought of intervention in the European war had disappeared overnight in favor of strengthening lines closer to home . The House itself , while its Naval Affairs Committee was voting to provide a two-ocean navy which could defend the Western Hemisphere against any probable combination , joined the Senate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any transfer of sovereignty of Western Hemisphere possessions to other than an American power . The Senate adopted this resolution yesterday by 76 to 0 and the House followed suit today by 383 to 8 . President Roosevelt , at his press conference , contributed a thought to the possible implications of the enormous defense program , which // TWO OCEAN FLEET SPEEDED AT CAPITAL // seems to be now only in its beginning , by discussing the question of compulsory government service , not necessarily military , for all Americans when they reach a certain age . He indicated that a plan was under study and would be submitted to Congress within the next few weeks . At the War Department , officers ' discussions centered on hemisphere defense to the exclusion of European fighting . There were estimates that 20 per cent of the total national production might be kept busy for years in supplying only the arms , ammunition and implements of war needed for the defense of the Western Hemisphere . Cartel Program Is Advanced Secretary Wallace conferred with President Roosevelt on the Administration 's plan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a victorious Germany , which could dictate . buying terms to American republics . This plan apparently has been further advanced in consultation with the other members of the Pan-American Union than has been publicly disclosed , and Mr. Wallace is reported to have recommended the creation of a revolving fund of $2,000,000,000 to get the plan started . On the home industrial front the Senate Subcommittee on Military Affairs of the Appropriations Committee approved an item of $43 , - 500,000 for the manufacture by the Ford Motor Company of 3,000 airplane motors of the Rolls-Royce type . The contract was reported to have been awarded today . The subcommittee voted to include this money in the Supplemental Defense Appropriation Bill , amounting to about $1,780,000,000 . Of all the defense developments , however , the Navy 's proposal held the center of the stage at the Capitol . President Roosevelt emphasized that the measure would merely be by an authorization for construction which could be annulled at any time , but Representative Vinson of Georgia , chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee , made it plain that Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed two-ocean fleet would he necessary " for adequate defense in the Atlantic and Pacific , and to maintain the Monroe Doctrine hemispheric defense . " Seeks Quick Action on Navy Representative Vinson said he intends to ask the House for unanimous consent to consider the bill on Thursday and that , if this not forthcoming , he will ask for a special rule to make it the order of business on Friday . He said that it was essential to get the new program under way during the coming fiscal year , even though only $175 , - 000,000 of the estimated total expenditure could be usefully spent before the fiscal year , 1942 , and this mostly on plant expansion . Admiral Stark declined to make public the exact use which the Navy intends to make of the added tonnage . He said that valuable military information might be given away by too close a breakdown of the Navy 's plans . Preferring to deal in total tonnage , he told the committee that the proposed added tonnage of 1,325,000 would provide the Navy with about 200 more fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 385,000 tons ; airplane carriers , 200,000 tons ; cruisers , 420,000 tons ; destroyers , 250,000 tons , and submarines , 70,000 tons . In addition , he recommended that $25,000,000 he spent on small patrol craft , the discretion as to types to he left to the secretary of the Navy . Objective in Number of Ships Translated into terms of individual ships , Admiral Stark 's figures would mean that the Navy now has 378 fighting vessels on duty and 160 building , or " on the hooks , " as naval officers describe them . The added 200 or so in the new bill would bring the strength to about 750 units , plus auxiliaries to the amount of 100,01 tons , which Admiral Stark likewise recommended , and the small patrol craft . The question of the Navy 's air strength was left undecided by the committee in its haste to report the expansion bill . At one point it acceeded to the urging of Representative Maas of Minnesota to lift the existing legal limit of 10,000 planes to 15,000 , but reconsidered its action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics , testify tomorrow . On motion of Mr. Vinson , the committee included in the bill a limitation that no vessel in the navy could be disposed of or scrapped without the consent of Congress . The chairman said that he wanted this language included to stop current talk of destroyers being sold to the Allies . All for Monroe Doctrine Action On the floor of the House , the resolution to reaffirm the Monroe Doctrir was end ? sed on all sides , aft Representative Dies of Texas , chairman of the Committee on UnAmerican Activities , had told the members tha ' ' Hitler and Mussolini already have invaded the Western Hemisphere with agents and propaganda . " " I hope that , 1 efore adjournment , we can deal firmly with these , traitorous organizations that are seeking to do in this country what they did in France and other countries , " he told the House . The kind of invasion that was not contemplated by the Monroe Doctrine is the kind that has occurred in South America for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictators that they can not establish political organizations on our shores for the purpose of dividing our people . " The only serious opposition to the Administration resolution came in theform of an amendment by Representative Tinkham of Massachusetts to incorporate in the declaration  --  of non-recognition of transfer of sovereignty that part of President Monroe 's message to Congress which stated that this country takes no part in European wars and that it does not " comport with our policy so to do . " This was voted down , 104 to 66 . At a later stage , Representative Schafer , Republican , of Wisconsin , moved to recommit the bill to the Foreign Affairs Committee with instructions to incorporate this amendment . The motion was lost , 173 to 37 . Because of slight differences in language , the House resolution will have to be sent to the Senate for conference , but no difficulty was expected . Funds for Curb on Aliens Earlier in the day the House adopted and sent to the Senate the Second Deficiency Bill , which carried some items related to the defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inspection and Navigation to make closer checks on aliens in the merchant marine ; $2,200,000 for the Immigration and Naturalization Service for augmenting border patrols : and $325,000 for partial construction of a trans-Isthmian highway in Panama . The House , however , declined to reinstate an item of $1,000,000 for further investigation of rubbergrowing possibilities in the Western Hemisphere , as proposed by Representative Fish of New York . Representative Dirksen , Republican , of Illinois , reported that $438,000 has been spent in the last eight years on research of this character without important result and that the main reliance must now be placed in synthetic rubber industrially developed .
