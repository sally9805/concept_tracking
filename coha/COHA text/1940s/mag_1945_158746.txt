New England had rarely seen anything like it . But , after all , the world has rarely seen anything like General George Smith Patton Jr . Last week , when he came home from the wars , 750,000 people jammed the 20-mile parade route into downtown Boston waiting to see and cheer the conquering hero . Georgie Patton did not disappoint them . <P> He stepped down onto U.S. soil agleam with 24 stars , variously placed , all glittering : four on his shiny steel helmet , four on each shoulder loop , four on each collar tab , and four on the black butt of the automatic pistol at his hip . On the side of his helmet was the painted insigne of the armored divisions ; on the front , below the stars , was the Third Army 's " A " - which , in photographs , looked like a fifth star . On his chest was a quintuple corsage of campaign ribbons ; on his left sleeve , five overseas bars and four wound chevrons . He wore two rings on his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried to embrace his wife , it was apparent that he had grown old as well as famous in battle . His hair was white , his face lined . But he was still erect and turkey-cock as ever . <P> There He Is ! As the crowds roared their applause , he stood stiffly erect in a Fire-Department touring car , bowing , saluting , holding his helmet over his heart . At Lexington , where the world-heard shot was fired in 1775 , citizens had raised a banner : " WELCOME GEORGE BLOOD ' N ' GUTS PATTON . NICE GOING ! " At Cambridge City Hall the car drove beneath arched Fire-Department ladders . Handed a gavel . made from the Washington Elm , Georgie Patton promised , " I 'll cherish it forever . " <P> The triumphal procession moved through downtown Boston , finally reached the Charles River Esplanade , where 30,000 people roared themselves hoarse as Governor Maurice J. Tobin compared General Patton to Washington , Sheridan , Grant , Forrest and Stonewall Jackson . <P> That night , at a state dinner in Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit at his two married daughters , blew kisses , beamed happily at his wife . But as he rose to speak - still wearing his pistol-tears rolled down his cheeks and his high , thin voice grew almost inaudible . He sat down after less than five minutes , put a big handkerchief to his face . Then he lighted a big cigar . <P> Said his son , West Point Cadet George Smith Patton IV : " Same old Pop . " <P> A Poet , Too . As " Pop , " he went off to Hamilton , Mass. , to spend the night with his family . But the triumphal tour had just begun . Next day , after an eleven-and-a-half-hour plane flight , he arrived in Denver . Happily profane , he rattled off a stream of characteristic Pattonisms . Sample : he classed himself a " better poet than general . " As his plane rolled into its takeoff , Los Angeles bound , he found his hotel key in his pocket , chucked it out , yelling to those on the ground to return it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crowd fully as big as Boston 's turned out to cheer California 's Patton and Co-Hero Jimmy Doolittle . That night , 100,000 crowded into the Coliseum for a mammoth reception engineered by Hollywood Producer Mervyn Le Roy .
