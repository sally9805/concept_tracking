txt Tire Menace Deplored I am a salesman driving on New York City streets . The government rightly asked all motorists to conserve their tires . I am driving slowly and walk more to save mine . One sure way of preserving them would be to have the city ordinance enforced against littering the streets with broken glass . Many a time one can not avoid driving on broken glass and the result is cut tires . One of my precious tires was cut the other evening in Harlem , and although I had it revulcanisecl , that tire will not give me the same service I would have gotten without this damage . The other day I had to get out of my car and borrow a broom from a storekeeper to sweep millions of pieces of broken glass from the street . LOUIS FRIEDMAN .
