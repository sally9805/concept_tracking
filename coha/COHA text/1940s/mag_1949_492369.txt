INEVER tried to borrow the Hope diamond to cut a little glass with or offered to sing a barbershop tenor for one of Lily Pons ' arias . But I aroused about the same wild enthusiasm when I suggested to the American Broadcasting Company that I would like to join up with a television play and get an insider 's view of what it 's like to be in television . If you sometimes yearn for perfect quiet , you would have enjoyed the restful lull this offer produced . One of the network 's publicity men was an old friend from the days when we were both on Chicago newspapers . Television 's best goalie , this boy is ; a great defensive back . He immediately began thinking of outs , of spots where a determined intruder could do.the least possible harm in the smallest pea-30 sible way . " How about one of the variety shows that are set in night clubs ? " he suggested . " Of course , that 's not a play , exactly . But they must have people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like customers . You could handle that . Maybe even in costume  --  you know , wearing a necktie or holding a drink in your hand . " " If it 's got to be a play , " his assistant said , " and anybody is giving Arsenic and Old Lace , that has a corpse in it , inside a window seat . I forget whether he ever gets out or just stays in the window seat . " " Bob would be swell in that part , " my pal agreed . " He could do it without make-up . Seriously , " he went on , " the only play we 've got is Actors ' Studio , and the trouble with that is ... I do n't know just what they 've got planned . " It was a lame finish . He had caught himself just before concluding " the trouble with that is , that 's good . " The tone was the one used in saying : " All I 've got is the good silver , and I 'm certainly not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All I had was the good whisky , and I was n't going to waste that on a lot of guests . " But in a few days , he phoned , sounding a good deal more cheerful . The television people obviously had not been so indignant as he expected . " Actors ' Studio is giving a play called The Inexperienced Ghost , " he said . " It 's set in an English club , and they may need a steward or butler to hand somebody a hat or something . Might be right down your alley . " In the movies , a bad scene can be left on the cutting-room floor . In television , a blunder once made is made beyond repair . So I had muttered modestly that a small part might be best ; I did n't want to take a chance on lousing up a good production , and so on . Well , this part seemed modest enough , heaven knows . And before the thing was over , these solicitous souls found an even lighter task . They found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Life With Father . I was Promoted to a member of the club and used to fill a chair in the corner  --  a mighty laconic member , no doubt known around the club as Still Bill , the English Coolidge . Two other guys and I were television 's first venture into still life , and it will give you a rough idea of the challenging role entrusted to me to report that the guy in the chair next to Mine had more to do ; he had to pretend to be asleep with a handkerchief over his face . Still , the job did afford what I wanted ? a chance to see the wheels go round in a form of entertainment as new and as special as the first mule . What You see on the screen at home is something less than one-hundredth of the total turmoil  --  even though you sometimes see more than you 're supposed to , when the camera catches the raw edges of a set , the lights above or the microphone . Making no cracks about the quality of television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal More of television is unseen than seen . One of the big problems was clearly in evidence here ; although this show ran only a half hour on the air , it required some forty-six hours of rehearsal , in spite of the fact that it was done by highly competent Broadway talent under equally topnotch directors . This strange new trl-brid , this theater that goes to the audience , this broadcast stripped of radio 's invisibility , this movie made without film , simply takes a lot of doing . And I had a lot of time to keep tabs on this larger show of creating the show . At the outset I thought a little bitterly that I was participating only slightly More intimately than members of the audience , ranking somewhere between a voice off stage and half a canvas horse . But that was n't so  --  for one thing , the audience turned its back on these doings , so as to see only the play . Still , I had plenty of Chance to observe . As a matter of fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built my own television set and knitted a pair of heavy socks for Marc Connelly , the commentator . It might have been a useful contribution too . The play Rain is famous because rain fell throughout ; The Emperor Jones for the ominous beat of jungle drums . This television show also had a distinctive though perhaps baffling sound motif . It was contributed by Connelly , who kept pacing up and down at the rear of the hall in shoes that squeaked . Only on one score was this show a disappointment to a reporter eager to get truth down and break its arm . This had an all-male cast and afforded only a dull test of the redudress phenomenon . It has been said in print six dozen times that if a girl wearing a red dress passes before a television camera it photographs her right through the dress , so that she be-Comes what you might call a television of delight .

Four men are sitting on odds and ends of chairs he fore a chalk line on the linoleum floor marked bridge A prompter sits at one side at a rickety ? ridge table , and five or six other men stand or walk around , looking on . Somewhere in the building a soprano howls sweetly about love , and three or four midgets appear at the far end of the room and look ? I ) ? Nobody bothers to inquire why . The only resemblance this large bare room bears 10 a theater is that there is a low stage , which nobody la using .

This big empty room ten floors above Broadway is in the same category ; it is a workroom of Actors ' Studio . This is a kind of Stillman 's Gym where actors work out , instead of prize fighters . Two names spoken with great respect in such circles founded this nonprofit organization ? the producer , Cheryl Crawford , and the director , Elia Kazan , whose newest hits are A Streetcar Named Desire , and Love Life . Youngsters of promise go to school here , and you may find an actor from a comedy success such as Mister Roberts practicing here in heavy tragedy , to lengthen his drive or correct an acting slice . Actors ' Studio provides the talent for this television series , and the title . All you need for a theater is four walls and a passion , Dumas said , and that 's about all they have here today . But inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are acting out a short story by H. G. Wells , in which four clubmen are about to have a somewhat remarkable evening . One of them looks out a nonexistent window and frowns ; you know the weather is dismal again . A jaunty member , Clayton , played by 11r . Dennis King , has a tale to tell . Seems he caught a ghost in this clubroom . Yes , and talked to the bounder pretty curtly , too , at first . " Are you a member of this club ? " Clayton demanded . The ghost said no , he was n't . " Then what are you doing here ? " Well , it turned out the poor specter was having troubles . Now Clayton and the ghost re-enact this meeting , in a flashback . The ghost , Nibby , is apologetic ; he is n't here by choice . He is hanging around for the very good reason that he has forgotten the passes that make him disappear . Not having been much good at anything in life , he is n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good scout , and bucks the ghost up greatly , pointing out several entertaining projects for haunting ? " You can lower real-estate values , and that would be a boon . " He encourages Nibby to practice those passes again Never say die , " Clayton says a little ineptly ? and finally Nibby manages it , and dematerializes . It 's an entertaining tale , which you fear is going to be another marshmallow piece of English whimsey until a sock ending shows you the thing was loaded all along . As Clayton tells his story , one of the members is struck by a thought : Clayton watched Nibby vanish , and must have observed the passes . Yes , Clayton says , he did ; they were quite simple . Would his scoffing listeners like to see them ? And standing before the fireplace , he goes through these gestures . . . and drops dead at their feet . The audience will see him last as a cheerful ghost , strolling through walls and furniture , promising to haunt his old friends at odd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast at tacking a short , simple and amusing little play . Simple , certainly , compared with the one that opened this television series . That was an ambitious attempt to knock the critics ' eyes out , as it did . The play was a one-act affair by Tennessee Williams , with a leading lady , Jessica Tandy , who came over from Williams ' tremendous hit , A Streetcar Named Desire . For thirty minutes she played one of Williams ' deranged heroines , going to pieces in a shabby hotel . By comparison , The Inexperienced Ghost is a frolic , a hayride . Instead of Miss Tandy disintegrating mentally you have Lou Gilbert , the ghost , floating invisibly around the ceiling until Clayton tells him to be off  --  it would make a draft on the elderly members . These players ought to breeze through this like Notre Dame learning a quarterback sneak . There 's enough talent focused on this problem to give Macbeth as a musical . Indeed , Norris Houghton , who is directing , did put on the New York production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dennis King , who plays the lead , is the man who has played The Vagabond King with such perennial success ; he also played in Medea with Judith Anderson , and Pygmalion with Gertrude Lawrence . D. A. Clarke-Smith and Waldo Sturrey are borrowed from the successful Edward , My Son ; Lou Gilbert , the ghost , came over from the Cort Theater , where his work in Hope is the Thing With Feathers won a prize for a brilliant supporting role . Rex O'Malley , whose eloquent face completes the cast , played in The Cherry Orchard , The Lute Song and others . The producer , Donald Davis , is regarded as one of the best in a new business ; he has the rare combination of writing , Hollywood and stage experience that television seems to require . He , too , has a Broadway success in his record ; with his father , Owen Davis , he dramatized Ethan Frome for Raymond Massey . In a pinch , the commentator could write them a new play  --  Marc Connelly is of course the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in the Kaufman-Connelly hits . Or they could call on John Steinbeck , for the famous author of The Grapes of Wrath , Cannery Row and Of Mice and Men also is involved here . But if there 's a lot of talent there are also a lot of small imperative problems . " Cheat a little , " Houghton is telling Clarke-Smith . The director wants the actor not to sit quite naturally in his chair in this scene ; the camera ca n't get his expression . It is solved by having the actor turn his head to reach for his Scotch and soda  --  an empty glass on an old flower stand just now . That 's what takes the time : every fragment of action has to be planned and learned with the cameras in mind . Davis began this planning by making a blueprint of the play , using protractors showing what each camera gets at any moment . Otherwise you are likely to get something pretty comic  --  like the home movies that show a headless fisherman with the fish he caught , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless a television Juliet learns stage positions as thoroughly as her lines , you might get a shot of Juliet and the sound-effects man , which has plot possibilities , but does n't follow the original story . All this week Houghton will try to think like three fifty-millimeter camera lenees , and he does n't have the cameras  --  they wo n't work before cameras until Sunday . This is a little like arranging music for an eight-piece orchestra  --  the story will be told by five principal actors as shown by three cameras . Just now they are trying the scene where Clayton becomes a ghost . One camera will be on Clayton ( King ) as he begins the mystic passes . He waves his hands , once , twice . . . then his face grows tense , his raised arms tremble violently . And with that , another camera takes over , showing the alarmed faces of Clayton 's friends . " Perhaps he 's stuck ! " one exclaims . Presumably they are staring in awe at Clayton . Actually , they are staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act . The minute he was out of camera view he stepped through the big fireplace and trotted around the hall behind the cameras , to take up a carefully charted position against a black backdrop . Another camera firing from a position equally well rehearsed will turn him into a ghost . Then two cameras will let this picture of Clayton walk around through a picture of the clubroom , so the specter can seem to move through furniture . Just as a child can sometimes manage to inherit his mother 's popeyes and his father 's buck teeth , but avoid the good features of either parent , so television inherits all the troubles of radio , the movies and the stage without their advantages . Radio actors can use scripts and need not learn their lines . Radio sweethearts can play an impassioned love scene fifteen feet apart at individual tables , and a sound man will do their kissing for them . But television actors have to act . Furthermore , they need scenery and costumes . And the director has to edit on the fly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors and almost no television writers . These are some of the problems our friends are stuck with , and let 's leave them there . We 'll come back Sunday ; they 'll still have plenty to iron out . So now it 's Sunday afternoon , with the show going on the air at 8:30 tonight . Again we meet our four clubmen . But these pampered aristocrats are no longer sitting around on garden and kitchen chairs in a bare studio . Now they are huddled on a piano bench and a couple of odd chairs in what looks like an overcrowded secondhand store . This is the anteroom , and attic , apparently , of a new layout on 66th Street ? ABC 's new television center . " Do n't be surprised if a few absentminded horses wander in , " somebody remarks . This building was a riding academy until a few weeks ago . Stagehands , technicians and others squeeze past ; the four actors might as well be rehearsing on a traffic island in Madison Avenue . For perhaps the ninety-ninth time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Sturrey is letting the young whippersnapper know he regards this as a pretty feeble joke . They 're rehearsing here because they ca n't get into their clubroom ; the set is just now being finished in the studio itself . The studio is a big , high room about the size of a tennis court , and will be pretty cramped for all that is going to take place . At the far end they are building the set  --  a paneled room not much more than fifteen feet long . It looks small , and , as a matter of fact , the actors wo n't have much room to spare . One of the peculiarities of television , however , is that while people look their natural size , rooms look bigger than life . This one will look spacious , because the stage designer , James McNaughton , has built perspective into it . The prevailing color is brown , just as you would expect , but it turns out this is faulty expecting . Brown is an innovation ; usually a television set is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail . Ralph Warren , ABC 's television director , comes in . Once the cameras are ready , Houghton 's work will be done , and Warren will take over to rehearse both cameramen and actors . Warren will direct the actual " filming " tonight . At this stage no major changes have to be made , but there will be about seventy-five small new problems to be worked out . In a way , this is tougher than making a movie . A movie director can cut and alter and shoot again . Once this show goes on the air , Warren , directing the cameras like a submarine commander calling out firing orders , will have to edit as he goes along . He seems pleased with a bushel of progress , but finds a grain of error  --  the kind of discovery that must drive stage designers nuts . Not that it makes any difference , he says , but in one of the little shields painted on the wall , as part of the heraldic decorations , does n't that bar sinister slant the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faulty bar sinister would signify . The possessor would have to be both illegitimate and erroneous , and that is being illegitimate in a big way . Still , there are radio people who would say at times that our friends have stumbled on television 's perfect coat of arms . Over the set they are hanging eighteen or twenty klieg lights , looking like metal peck baskets , and seven or eight baby spots . Another light behind the big false fireplace throws firelight on the actors ' faces ; ribbons on a fan make the light flicker and dance . The lights originally used in television made the sets hotter than high noon in the tropics , but that 's in the primitive past . These are not very hot , and would n't melt make-up , as used to happen . As a matter of fact , Warren decides to dispense with make-up entirely . Neither is the set exceedingly bright . Although television used to be played in a blinding blaze , the light they are using on this stage is only about 300 foot-candles . Barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked used instead of new , and what they found most certainly has been used ? by many a human and several mice . Every one of the big leather chairs they set on stage has at least one large rip in it , exposing frowzy stuffing . It 's that lived-in look , all right . It looks as if nobody in this club had paid dues since Edward VII first tipped his bowler to Lily Langtry . Stagehands begin patching the rents with transparent tape . That furniture is doubtless why I got promoted from butler . As this play opens , the camera will traverse the room , showing the clubmen in various stages of well-bred lethargy , some simply sitting , some of the more boisterous souls reading the paper . Houghton looked once at the chairs , once at the remnants of talent available , and decided the chairs would look a little better if occupied . So three of us  --  the prompter , the man who is dropping dead for King , and myself  --  were made members of the club and used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big teacher 's pet , gets to pretend be is asleep . The double and I are simPlY human patches , living slip covers . Through the cameras , that beat-up furniture looks wonderful . Television may not flatter people . They ca n't stop for the special lighting that will make a plain face beautiful in the movies , so the photography 's pretty candid . But television certainly flatters furniture . One of these old chairs looks too good ? the top of the back gleams too much in the klieg lights . They rub on a little clay , and do the same to a brass table lamp . That extinguishes small flares of light that would be disturbing . There is no audience where an audience would sit in a theater . That apace  --  about three quarters of the hall  --  will be needed by the cameramen , moving around like three preoccupied piano movers , courteously keeping out of one another 's way . Some scenes will be taken against the left Wall , some against the rear wall , along with those taken on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a little glass-enclosed booth high on the right wall . When the play starts , these Spectators turn their backs on the activi ? ty on stage , and watch proceedings on a television screen . Otherwise they 'd Nee far too much . There is no curtain . There is nothing backstage and the wings are as open to view as the stage . If they were giving The Man Who Came to Dinner you 'd not only see the expresamen carry Lorraine away in her Mummy cage but you 'd see her step out of it , once outside of camera range , and borrow a cigarette from them . No. 2 camera , opposite center stage , kill open the show , moving around like a latecoming theatergoer who has to Pass directly across in front of everybody . This is the baby built for traveling , the only one that can move during shots  --  the others move between shots . It is a two-man job on four rubber tires not quite big enough for a midget racing auto , with a man to push while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks at the camera 's side . To open , this camera will start at the actors ' far right and move across the entire stage , to show the whole scene . The cameramen and the dolly-pusher will have to walk backward , the dolly-Pusher kicking his electric cables out of the way behind him , like an angry bride trying to walk backward in her train . After eight or ten feet , the cameraman will step nimbly over the wheels of the soundman 's chariot and begin backing away to focus on the four clubmen before their fireplace . That sound chariot is double trouble . Built like a futuristic antiaircraft gun , it dangles a microphone over the actors ' heads on a boom twelve or fourteen feet long , looking for all the world as if the soundman were fishing for the actors . Unless the cameramen are lucky , will get an accidental shot of the mike . Moving as much as they do , like the pieces in some big but incoherent game , the cameramen skirt chats all the time . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three-way collisio " blow their tops and begin chasing one .. mother with the tables for lariats . Warren works long and carefully on those trick shots . This is television 's first attempt to tell a ghost story , and the idea must have the engineers talking bitterly to themselves . Here they spend years trying to turn pictures into electrons and send them through the air , to pass the miracle of long-range vision . And what do these actor fellows want to do with it ? They want to make a couple of men disappear . They want to do what the engineers have been catching hell for . " Ghost " is a had word in television . It means a form of trouble  --  the extra image that sometimes appears when a set is seeing double . They sometimes get " negative ghosts , " with black and white areas reversed . If I were a cad , I would remark that television has never had much trouble making people invisible before . In the saloon where I watched the World Series , the pitchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were moments when all of Braves Field disappeared with a capacity crowd . There were also a few blue snowfalls , and times when players turned into a bunch of stripes or performed a remarkable cooch dance never seen on any diamond . But that was no doubt partly the fault of amateur tuning by volunteer experts ; everybody who owns a television set seems to regard himself as the very Marconi of tuning and the only man who can do it right . In tonight 's play they have to make Nibby , the ghost , materialize in a chair while talking to Clayton . To do it , they find two chairs exactly alike , and set one of them against a wall duplicating one on stage . Nibby will leave the stage while " invisible , " and sit in the extra chair . One camera will be trained on this , another on the empty one on stage . When Clayton calls , " Nibby , where are you ? " they will superimpose a picture of Nibby in Chair A on the picture of empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Nibby will seem to take form on stage . It is simple enough if precisely executed , but has n't been clone before and needs practice . They like an imaginative touch on this show . In doing a Thurber short story , they made a recording of the hero 's thoughts and played the recording while he ate a sandwich in a tearoom . When radio tries this stream-of-consciousness stuff the actor speaks into an echo box . It was much more striking in television . You could see the mild little hero and hear him happily planning a murder while eating a pimento on Melba toast . After a little while the actors begin to look a little quaint and old-fashioned . You figure out why . They are the only people around here not wired like an electric lamp or a vacuum cleaner . Everybody else is wearing earphones and the kind of mouthpieces telephone operators use  --  the cameramen , the dolly-pusher , the soundman on his chariot , the sound-effects man and the floor manager , a new dignitary peculiar to television . He stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the phone booth , cuing the actors on their entrances and the sound-effects man on his crashes , screams or doorbells . He does this by silent signal , of course , since anything he said would go out on the air . He is television 's version of the stage manager ; this model is wired for sound . The director in the booth does n't wear earphones ; he ca n't , since , along with talking to six or eight people , he has to listen . He wears a mike , of course , but it 's strictly one-way ; nobody can talk back . There would n't be time for any discussion anyway . The nominal hero of this play is Dennis King . But that 's the play the audience will see . The real hero of any television play is the director  --  in this case , Warren . A television director is busier than a switchboard operator locked in with the town wolf and all phones ringing . He never has less than six or eight things to do at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the turmoil in his mind must resemble the interior of a pinball game when somebody makes 600,000 . Any mother would understand it  --  it is like having something boiling over on the stove with one child climbing on the piano , another reaching for the meat cleaver , the cat spilling the goldfish bowl , and a give-away program on the phone . To complete the parallel , she ought to be wearing new bifocals . This skipper 's bridge is a glass-fronted booth in the rear of this hall up one flight of iron stairs . Two long tables parallel with the glass window are arranged like steps . It is something like the press coop at a big football game , in that those sitting here usually greatly outnumber the performers . Four television screens are glowing at the table nearest the glass . They show three , but not four , versions of what 's going on , on stage . These are the " preview screens " and the master . All the cameras are running , although only one of the three pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 1 camera is getting , the others do the same for No. 2 and No. 3 cameras . A red light glowing on No. 1 camera shows that its picture is the one they are televising at this moment . That is also the image on the master screen . Preview screens 2 and 3 show , as far as this is possible , what will come next . The engineers are polishing up the pictures  --  much as you might tune the picture on your home receiver  --  to be ready when needed . Maybe No. 3 camera takes the ball next , for a close-up shot . The engineer is getting that scene in the best possible focus . He speaks of removing " blooms " ? unwelcome flares of light . The white bosom of an actor 's shirt may produce a bloom that obscures his face . Or the engineer may simply be giving the scene more intensity , like a photographer trying for a better print . Cameras differ a little , and the job is to get pictures with a unified tone . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a little hotter than the others , and more sensitive . There is always a chance , of course , that one will burn out , leaving the director to do some frantic rearranging of his plans , but that does n't happen often . " Take Three , " says the beleaguered director , and now the image on the master screen , and being televised , is what No. 3 camera sees . The director watches all the screens like a lion tamer trying to watch three or four lions . He it on the second table , like a tank commander in the turret , and performs this interesting little trick : While listening to his assistant talking into his right ear , he talks to the cameramen by phone Meanwhile watching the master screen to see how the present scene is going But taking a fast peek at whatever screen indicates how the upcoming scene will look , and Giving directions ? " Take One , " " Take Two , " or " Take Three " ? to the engineer on his left , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left in this line-up  --  we are behind them all , looking down toward the set ? is the producer , Davis , who ca n't do much at this point except hope for the best . Next to him is Warren 's assistant , who is holding a script and talking into Warren 's ear , reminding him what the next scene will be ? " A medium two shot by Number Three camera , " maybe  --  meaning a shot at medium range of two people . This official is like an assistant quarterback muttering signals for the play after this one , while the quarterback is trying to call signals for the present play . Next comes the director , next to him the engineer with the camera buttons , and at right end , a sound engineer who is monitoring the quality and quantity of the sound . He will also produce , on a turntable , any special musical or background effects . " If the actors start building a scene up , and get their voices too high to suit the sound engineer , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains . " The engineers at the preview screens are taking a scene the director wanted dim , and making it as bright as possible . In television , everybody works against everybody else . " The engineers brighten a scene almost instinctively ; unless it is " burning up " with light , they fear they are n't getting it . Then , too , the " carnation wearers " like their television bright . " Carnation wearers " is the respectful way radio 's creative and technical people refer to network vice-presidents . In a simple boy-meets-girl scene , the television operation goes something like this : No. 2 camera fades in on a long shot of the room , watching boy enter left , girl enter right . As they begin to meet , the No. 2 cameraman starts forward as if he were bringing the potato salad for this picnic ; he dollies in to take a medium shot of the pair . The director , on his phone , orders " Number One camera ready for girl 's close-up ; Number Three ready for boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the preview screens , the director is getting three views of this . " Take Three , " he orders . The red light winks out on No. 2 camera and appears on No 3 ; that is taking a close-up of the boy as he tells the girl he is a rich used-car dealer and thinks she has pretty elbows . No. 1 camera takes over for a close-up of the girl as she realizes that this elbow-crazy snake is trying to put his arm around her . She flounces out , followed by No. 1 camera , while No. 3 gets in position for a medium shot of the boy , happily stretching out for a nap . It will be evident that the cameras have almost as much of a role to learn as the actors , although they 'll get cues through the earphones . They 'll begin this show the way movies open ? with titles , printed on cards hanging on an easel . These announce that the name of the program is Actors ' Studio and that it is a production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show in itself as television matures . Novelist John Steinbeck and Photographer Robert Capa , homeward bound from an assignment in Russia for the New York Herald Tribune , fell in with Henry S. White in Paris and got to talking about television . White is a former CBS man who stayed in Paris after the war to handle English broadcasts for the French radio . Steinbeck was excited by television 's possibilities ; he thinks it will " take the place of most of the other arts , " including his own , because " it combines them all . " Taking in Phil Reisman , an RKO vice-president , as a fourth , they found some well-heeled stockholders and launched World Video . It was undoubtedly because Stein-beck was in this venture that Kazan and Crawford would go along ; Stein-beck has promised that his outfit  --  all concerned manage to mention his name proudly at least once in every sentence  --  will not " talk down to people . " He also delighted lovers of candor by citing one forthright reason for his interest : " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television . " The young man who is dropping dead for King will be as tired tonight as if he had spent the afternoon playing touch football in the park ? he runs through the fall a dozen times , until they get the timing of this crucial scene just as they like it . Rehearsal goes on all afternoon , the cast knocks off for a snack about seven , and comes back for a final run-through just before curtain time . Then they relax a few minutes , and at S:30 the show goes on the air . No curtain rises , no audience applauds , but this is the real performance ; you can see the actors putting new zing into it . Up in the control room , Warren gently keeps up his slow singsong : " Take One . Number Two camera ready for the close-up . . . . Take Two . . . Take Three . " The engineers in front of him fiddle with knobs , needles swing in lighted dials , the four screens glow with very clear pictures of what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting it all , and if it is coming through anywhere near as well in the spectators ' homes , it is good entertainment . This thirty-minute crisis goes off Without a hitch and finishes on the nose . Two signs lie on the base of the sound chariot , one reading " Speed it up , " the other " Stretch it out . " Neither has to be hoisted . I was n't ham enough to look and see what Variety said about the performance . Having simply gone along for the ride , I did n't expect any mention . It Was n't likely that the critics would clamor to know the name of the unidentified stranger playing brief right end , and , sure enough , they did n't , the louts . Of course , the part was n't large . Still , unless there is somebody who can sit in two chairs , I do n't see how it could have been done much better . Fleeting , of course , and yet , somehow , fleeting is what you 'd have to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this taciturn representative of the British upper classes  --  impassive , world-weary and possibly a little cockeyed , too , but that is what comes of trying to watch a moving camera out of the corner of the eye while staring at the ceiling . I feel I am ready for bigger parts now . Anybody need a character who not only sits in the corner but gets to say speeches like " Hello " and " Good-by " ? questions than could be found in the Presbyterian catechism . " Father , " Dunc gasped . " Well ? " " You know grandmother 's twin ? Aunt Ann ? " " Yes . Of course . She was your great-aunt . I never saw her , though . " " You know she had a husband ? " Doctor MacKay smiled . " That 's right . She did . Pretty girls often do get husbands . " " Well , he 's coming . " " You must be mistaken , " said Dune 's father . " Captain Arundel would n't be coming here . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dinner party in Louisville , in 1860 . She was visiting Cousin Charles Stuart . Captain Arundel was a wealthy Southern planter and a slaveowner . We were abolitionists up here . It made your grandmother feel very badly to have her twin marry a slaveowner and live in the South . " " Yes , sir . " Dune was waiting as patiently as he could for an opportunity to give out with his news . " That same summer , your grandmother married father . The next spring the war broke out . Father went into the Army a few days before I was born and he was finally killed at Fort Done/son . " " Yes , sir , " said Dunc , fidgeting . " Captain Arundel was in General Lee 's army , as he had every right and duty to be , " continued Doctor MacKay . " While he was away fighting , Aunt Ann died of malaria fever . That was a great shock to mother . That , coupled with father 's death , made her very sad . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . You 'll understand these things better when you 're older . " " I 'm trying to tell you , " Dunc could contain himself no longer . " He 's coming here . To visit grandmother . Next week . " " Who ? " " This Arundel . " Doctor MacKay smiled . Then he frowned . " Nonsense . Who started such a story ? " " Jim Free . " " Jim says more than his prayers . " " But it is true , " Dunc insisted . " They 're cleaning house all over again to get ready . " It was the house cleaning that convinced him . Doctor MacKay started up from his armchair , his features set in hard lines . " You mean Captain Arundel is coming here ? " he demanded harshly . " To visit mother ? " We nodded . " Mother ca n't do this , " Doctor MacKay muttered . " No , I wo n't have it . " He snatched his hat from the coat tree and went out of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a runaway . In those days even our accidents were horse-drawn .
