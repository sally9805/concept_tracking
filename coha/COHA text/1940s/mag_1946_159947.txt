Washington tried hard to play down the first U.S. visit of British Field Marshal Viscount Bernard Law Montgomery , Chief of the Imperial General Staff . Just a friendly call , said Harry Truman . Uneasy Monty , whirled through a hectic tour last week of U.S. military posts , donned his chattiest air of idle curiosity . But the yen to talk turkey about U.S.-British strategy was as plain as the eight rows of ribbons on Monty 's chest . <P> For a man with no reputation for tact , Monty acquitted himself nobly . At West Point he studied a practice session of the Army football squad . " I hope your team wins all its matches , " he ventured . " Your West Point , " he commented later , " is absolutely the cat 's whiskers . " <P> When his C-47 reached Kansas City , Monty confessed his astonishment over the local skyscrapers : " An amazing country , this America , you know . " Local boosters in Montgomery , Ala. , ( " a city named after me " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man for you . That quick nipping backwards and forwards across the mountains ; that resolution ; that nerve . " <P> That 's an Island . But the veteran of rugged North Africa and Normandy campaigns nearly came a cropper while inspecting Fort Benning , Ga . Enthusiastic Master Sergeant Hugh Cook cornered the Marshal with a tale of the battle for Okinawa . Monty , magnificently insular , looked blank . " That 's an island in the Pacific , sir , " prompted Lieut . General J. Lawton Collins , Army Public Relations chief . Monty looked relieved . <P> To while away the time on long air hops Monty took a fling at an old U.S. pastime . " Your people have been showing me a new game with dice . They call it shooting craps . It 's been a lot of fun . We 've been shooting craps for matches in the air . " Added the hero of El Alamein : " I 've lost all my paper matches . " <P> Between junkets Monty endured the full rigors of official Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Daily News 's snippety-snappety Ruth Montgomery asked if he really had an aversion to " women . " Oh , I 'm very fond of the ladies , " he retorted with a chuckle . On the south lawn of the White House he joshed with the President over the burning of the Executive Mansion by the British in 1814 . Said Monty : " I 'm really very sorry about it . I think we ought to pay for it . ... Or perhaps you might send some American soldiers to burn down Whitehall . " <P> Banter aside , the Montgomery visit was a serious reconnaissance of the present stage of U.S. military weapons and training . Before 100 U.S. General Staff officers , personally selected by Eisenhower , Monty gave in return his own off-the-record evaluation of the tension in Europe . When he returned to Britain this week , Monty would take back something more lasting than paper matches .
