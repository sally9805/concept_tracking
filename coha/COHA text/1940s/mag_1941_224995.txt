In a message to the A.F. of L. convention , President Roosevelt rapped out : " This is not the time to take chances with the national safety through any stoppage of defense work . . . . " Amen , said President William Green . Amen , squeaked the Communist Daily Worker ( its voice is still changing ) . Said the Daily Worker : <P> " If Hitler is not defeated , the very existence of our nation and of the entire trade-union movement is imperiled . . . . Anything that interferes with production . . . whether as a result of strikes or of delays by the employers-can only help Hitler and weaken the defense of the United States . " ( Next day the irreverent New York Daily News commented : " The millennium arrived yesterday . " ) <P> Nevertheless , strikes continue . War Department figures for September showed that 81 strikes in plants working on Army contracts caused a loss of 282,350 man-days . At that , it was a drop from August 's record : 88 strikes , 421,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's entire production of light tanks , " jeeps , " armored trucks , scout cars was imperiled , according to the War Department , by a dispute at Spicer Manufacturing Corp. , makers of truck transmissions . Reason : squabble between A.F. of L. Montagues &; C.I.O. Capulets . Because transmissions are the guts of any shaft-driven car , production of combat cars was threatened at the American Car &; Foundry plant in Berwick , Pa. , at Ford , White Motor Co. , Willys-Overland . <P> <P> &gt; For two weeks the whole U.S. rubber industry faced the possibility of a shutdown as the result of a strike of A.F. of L. workers at the Calco Chemical Division of American Cyanimid Co. , Bound Brook , N.J. Reason : the plant produces aniline oil , an accelerator for curing rubber . Management and employes , at the appeal of the National Defense Mediation Board , signed a truce , agreed to keep working while demands for a closed shop and 10-an-hour rise were negotiated . <P> &gt; Important repair work on 17 U.S. and British ships was delayed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , quit work for three days . Reason : acetylene-torch burners would not work beside four non-union burners . <P> &gt; Manufacture of airplane parts was held up but not stopped by a C.I.O. strike at Air Associates , Inc. , in Bendix , N.J. , which has $5,000,000 worth of defense-program contracts . It was another flare-up in an old squabble which began last summer . At week 's end , after efforts to mediate had failed , the Mediation Board washed its hands of the dispute , left the next move up to the Administration .
