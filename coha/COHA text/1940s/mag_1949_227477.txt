This is how a government was formed last week in Athens , the city of Pericles . <P> After Premier Themistocles Sophoulis ' death ( TIME , July 4 ) , King Paul asked Foreign Minister Constantin ( " Dino " ) Tsaldaris , a Populist ( right-winger ) , to form a new cabinet . In his eagerness , Dino promised portfolios to 27 of his friends . At the last minute , he found there were only 25 ministerial posts to fill . With great presence of mind , Tsaldaris simply created two new cabinet posts-Tourism and Physical Culture . <P> Tsaldaris ' candidate for Minister of Physical Culture declined the post . Then several minor parties proposed another coalition under a mild Byzantine scholar , nonpartisan Deputy Premier Alexander Diomedes . Tsaldaris insisted on an all-Populist cabinet with himself as Premier and for a while it looked as though he would have his way . One evening last week , all the cabinet candidates , immaculate in grey ties and white shirts , were assembled in Tsaldaris ' living room , drinking Turkish coffee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the swearing-in ceremony . <P> The phone rang ; the caller was Sophocles Venizelos , a Liberal who had previously gone along with Tsaldaris . He had changed his mind . The happy faces began to bead with sweat . There was nothing to be done ; the candidates went home . <P> <P> Next day , Tsaldaris drove to the King 's summer palace , 16 miles from Athens , and suggested a Tsaldaris-Venizelos coalition-let each be Premier for three months , in rotation . Many things are possible in Greek politics , but not that . The King said no ; instead , without telling Tsaldaris , he decided to give the premiership to War Minister Panayotis Kanellopoulos , one of Greece 's few first-rate administrators . U.S. officials were delighted with the King 's choice . <P> That evening , without an inkling of the King 's intention , Kanellopoulos put on his white tie &; tails and went to a going-away party for the air attache at the U.S. embassy . At the embassy 's front door , Kanellopoulos all but collided with Michael Ailianos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in high agitation . Inside , everyone from U.S. Ambassador Henry F. Grady down started congratulating Kanellopoulos , who finally caught on . Meantime , Sprinter Ailianos , who had also found out about the Kanellopoulos plan at the party , rushed to Tsaldaris to tell him what was going on . Promptly , Tsaldaris rushed to the King . To prevent Kanellopoulos ' appointment , Tsaldaris chose the lesser of two evils , agreed to serve as Foreign Minister under nonpartisan Diomedes , who had been scheduled to be his Vice Premier . The King reluctantly approved . This week , Diomedes and his cabinet were sworn in . It was virtually the same as the old cabinet .
