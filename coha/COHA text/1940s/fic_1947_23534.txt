4 ? THE COLLECTION A STORY BY V. S. PRITCHETT I T HAPPENS ( when it does happen ) on Sunday mornings . On weekdays , when he has to go to his factory , he is the first up , but on Sunday mornings he lies in . He awakens and first of all he looks at his wife , who is curled up like a white grub , with her hair all over her eyes . Typical . What a muddle she makes of sleeping ; not like other women he knows . Of course he does n't mean that he knows what other women are like in bed , never has ; but that is one black mark against her : he has been faithful to her , she might at least keep her hair tidy . And then there was last night  --  surely at their age , forty-five or whatever it is , without being vulgar about it  --  well ( he thinks ) , I married a woman who does n't understand the word " progress . " He turns his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there disturbed by the strange silence of the house . That 's it : just because it 's Sunday and he 's not getting up , they are n't getting up . Why should n't they get up for a change ? " Edward , Philip , Rose , " he shouts to the children . " Get up . " And then to his wife whose wakening eyes glitter like a pair of ants under her hair : " Come on , girl . " " Sunday , " he says poetically . " Look at the sun . It is streaming in . Look at the sky . Listen to the birds . They 're not wasting the day . " But nobody moves . After this the usual thing happens . It is surprising how no one understands him in the house ; he has to lose his temper and start shouting at the lazy hounds , the curs , to get the family to their feet . " Oh you , " says his wife , to whom he has given a push . " You never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bed stark naked . She is thin and round shouldered and her neck is red . " Here , here , I say , " he says jovially , but he hates that about her more than anything . He closes his eyes at the sight . " Pah , " he says to himself . " There 's no getting away from it . I married beneath me . " Downstairs in the kitchen , the children are mooching , laying the table , kicking the furniture he can hear that  --  cleaning his boots , scared that they are getting blacking on the laces or skimping the heels . He is lying in bed , listening to them , when suddenly he remembers : " Good God , this Sunday I 'm taking the collection . " He is out of bed at once , standing in his collapsing pajamas . Why did n't someone remind him ? The children go to the bottom of the stairs and listen . " He 's in the bath , " they say . T WENTY minutes go by , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet reigns over it . One after another the children tiptoe and listen . Enormous volumes of water , as if the Congo were pouring into the house , are heard in the bathroom , sounds like the breathing and thumping of boxers , silences so long that he may have drowned . Then , through the keyhole , they see him shave ; the dark rhino cheek frilled by soap , straining , Christianwise , to turn from the mirror , while the sacrificial blade comes down . When he is back in his room , they 212 MAGAZINE see him put on his blue suit and blue shirt and then take them off again . A hot smell of scent fills his room as he rubs three different lotions into his black hair while he considers the problem . He is taking the collection . Would the brown or the gray be more suitable ? Or would it not be best to wear his tail coat and his striped trousers ? He puts on a wing collar which bites at his throat and slices into his jowl . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disdains himself in the mirror , The spy creeps down and a stair-rod comes out on the last tread . " Confound you , you clumsy hound , what are you doing ? " he roars from the mirror . " He 's nearly ready , mum , " the spy whispers . Treading like a cat , floating silkily down , watching the amazing stripes of his trousers , with the gravity of a mourner , a little distracted like a bridegroom by the flash of his spats which might make him misjudge the steps if he were not careful , he arrives downstairs and pauses in the doorway and puts on the impersonal yet benevolent scowl he intends to wear as he stands at the end of the pews waiting for the plate to come down the row . A plate in fact arrives ; it is a plate of porridge rushed toward him by his wife . " Oh , " she cries stopping dead , tipping the plate . " You give me a fright . " " Give ! " he says . " Gave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Does n't she know that it is an important thing to take the collection at the chapel , that people have their eye on you , that it has got to be done properly , and that people say , there 's twenty-pound-aweek taking the collection . And in a sense , God is looking too . God is saying , " That 's it . Do n't spare the expense . I want the best . " " Give me a brush , " he says . " And the back . I look after my clothes . Where are those boys ? Are n't they coming to church ? " " I do n't know where they are , " she says . " Give the brush to me , " he says . " They were here , " she says . " They 're outside , I expect . " " Outside ! " he shouts , hitting himself with the brush , lashing himself up . " I do n't understand you , outside ! The onlyday their father is home , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is beginning to sweat . " You 'll be late , " she says to him . " Edward , Philip , " he roars at the door , wiping his hat . There is no answer , " Come here when I call you . " He puts his hat on . No answer . " Come and watch your father go . He 's going . Come and watch . " She calls in her lighter voice . He stands there waiting , looking as though he will explode . " If I had behaved like this to my father , " he raps out , " I 'd have been thrashed within an inch of my life . " But he has marched off , slamming the gate , as they creep up from the back of the house . T ilE , garrulous church bells are stirring up the morning heat . No obedience , he thinks ( once he is out of the house ) , no discipline , no love . No religion . That 's her doing . No God . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swine . Idle hounds lounging about in the shed . Slack , do n't wash . I slave all the week for their education and what do I get ? They bleed you , that 's what children do , bleed you white . The government 's the same , bleeds you with taxation . Who goes to church nowadays ? No one . Who believes in God  --  look at the state of the world for the answer . Why did we have a war ? Perhaps if it could be reckoned up , if you could get some really good accountant at it , it would turn out that I am the only one who really believes in the Truth . Many think they do ; but do they ? Gradually , like the unfolding of a white rose in the sun , an intoxicating sensation of conspicuousness opens in his mind . He feels that he is flashing with sadness . And then as he gets near to the granite chapel , he is happy . He sees the shabby people go in . They turn to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? Maybe . He himself goes into the chapel and looks at the small congregation . The believers are few . They are indeed the elect but the elect look dispirited . In the half-empty chapel he gazes at the red brick walls and he is calmed . He rises to sing , he kneels to pray , he sits . He is awakened by the organ . Before he is ready for it , the time to take the collection has come . On the other side of the aisle he sees Mr. Doncaster  --  wearing an ordinary brown suit -- -begin his collection as the organ mews and growls like an animal up in the loft . He stands up very upright  --  unlike Mr. Doncaster who is roundshouldered  --  he puts on the impersonal , official expression  --  not like Mr. Doncaster 's who leans over the congregation thanking them disgustingly like a grocer  --  he affects not to hear the chink of coins in the plate and raises his eyes to the rafters if there is the rustle of a note . He takes the plate and hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would like to take Mr. Doncaster 's side as well , because the pleasure of being given money for nothing has a touch of folly which only a man who has risen in the world can know . And then , as the organ rolls , he and Mr. Doncaster walk together , dead level , slowly -- lie can feel the eyes of the congregation on him , almost heavily on him , tipping the chapel down on his side like a scale pan  --  he and Mr. Doncaster , like bridegroom and bride , walk up the central aisle ; and , after placing their offerings , return with the same gravity . And all the time he is thinking , Doncaster must feel a fool not being in black . A sensation of being swept upward by his spatted feet , upward toward some expensive radiance , cool , fleshless , and flawless overcomes him as if he were drunk . His eyes shine and twinkle , his cheeks arc pink and happy . The sermon begins . The minister is barking away in the oak pulpit . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A house with natural oak everywhere is what he would like , with tall , church-like windows on the stairs , an organ in the wide entrance hall , an open fire as wide as the chapel at the communion rail ; gradually the chapel turns into a feudal castle , armor everywhere , himself in a kilt . His wife and children drift about in it , delightful creatures . Yes , he thinks , they are the children of God , we have put off the old Adam . His dreamy eyes come down from the chapel wails and he sees the yellow , bald head of old Doncaster . Yes , he says , poor old Doncaster who does n't brush his coat  --  yes , God made him , too . " I 'm hungry , " he says . " What-an appetite ! Going to chapel does you good , sets you up . I wonder what there is for lunch , " ELUCTANTLY he leaves the chapel , the scene of his vision . He has been in heaven . He marvels at the contradictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first he notices how well all the houses are painted and then the pleasant accent of people . The neighborhood is going up . Then , he notices , the property deteriorates . Fences arc not so good , a gate hinge has gone . It 's the war . His temperature lowers a little . He arrives at his own house . It is at the corner of the street and he notices , for the first time , that a paling has gone . The hedge has not been cut . A bush at the corner rocks like a broom . The boys are trampling down the garden again . He goes to his high gate . It sticks . He has to shake and rattle and then call . " Edward ! Philip ! " There is no answer . Yet distinctly he had heard them . He is obliged to dirty his gloves and his hands , forcing the confounded gate open . And what a sight : that paper left on the path . " Edward , " he says . " Come here . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What paper ? " " Just paper , father . " " Who put it there ? " " I do n't know . " Edward 's alarmed eyes are fixed on his father 's . He can not take them away . In that coat , that collar , so naked at the neck , behind the bars of those striped trousers , he looks militant and tigerish . " When did you clean your boots ? " says the father , sudden in his attack . The boy flinches . " This morning . " " Do n't lie , " says the father . " Why ca n't you tell the truth ? A man who does n't tell the truth , fearlessly , in all circumstances , come what may , forfeits my trust . If a man lies to me in my business I sack him  --  on the spot . Pick that paper up . " He goes into the house , " Philip , " he calls . " Why is n't the table laid ? Do you expect your father and mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no servants ? I suppose you think you are a lord or something . Let me tell you , in this world , we are all servants . " He marches into the kitchen . As he advances , he notices a shadow goes with him . Smiles vanish ; scowls , evasions , furtive , deceitful , lying looks pass over the faces of his family . It is all so unlike the communion of saints . " Do n't crash the forks on that table , " he calls back down the passage . " You would have to pay eighty pounds for it today . " His wife is still in her old apron , the sweat from the heat of the fire is on her face as she kneels . He goes out of the kitchen as quickly as he can . The family are sitting down to lunch . " Stop kicking the table , Philip , " he says , as he carves . He glares . They all lower their eyes . " Take that plate , pass it down , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " Others before self always , the golden rule . " And then he looks at Edward . " Edward , " he says . " What have you done to your hair ? " " Nothing . " " I told you before about lying . Why have you got your best suit on , getting yourself up like that , what 's the idea ? " " Edward wants to go out , " says Philip . " What 's that ? " he says . " What 's that , Edward ? Did I understand that you want to go out ? " On Sunday ? " he says . " Your father 's only day at home and you want to go out . I never heard of such a thing . " The father goes pale as if he had cut himself with the carving knife . ? " You stay in and shut up , Edward , " says his mother . " You cause enough trouble as it is . Get on with your food . " " Go out with who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you value more than your father and mother ? It 's not some girl , is it ? I wo n't have you go with girls . I do n't want trouble with girls at your age . Oh , I 'm glad to hear it . You 're not telling me lies , are you ? You tell lies . I know you deceive me , lie and deceive , but you ca n't deceive God . He sees , He knows when you 're telling lies . I do n't like people who tell lies . I do n't like boys who are n't friends with their fathers . It 's not some girl ? Look me in the face . " MAGAZINE " N'no , " says Edward in a weak voice . Tears are very near his eyes . A light glints in the father 's eyes . He has seen the son 's weakness . " N'no , n'no . I do n't understand that language . Be straightforward . If you mean yes , say yes . If you mean no , say no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight and speak to your father . Go on now  --  what is it ? " Tears pour into Edward 's eyes , tears of rage and shame , and rush down his cheeks . " I just want to go out . I want to get away from this , " he shouts , but he is crying so hard that no one understands . He shouts and cries , starts up and goes out of the room , knocking his chair over . " Look what you 've done ! " shouts the wife , banging down her knife and fork . " I ca n't stand this . Every Sunday the same . I 'm going too . " And crying also , she leaves the table . The father gapes at the astonishing scene . He looks down gently at the other children . What on earth have I done , he silently asks them . He suspects they are going to move , too . " Stop where you are , " he says . He stands there . The food is going cold on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He feels that lions are inside him rending him apart . He feels that he is like Samson , the hairy Samson of the Bible , who has pulled down the temple crashing on top of him . The day he has taken the collection , too . Thank God , he thinks , I shall be at the office tomorrow . People understand me there . O F COURSE , he gets them back . It takes a bit of doing , the lunch is cold , but she heats it up again . Everyone has a good cry and while they 're at it , he goes up and changes into another suit . Everyone is shy and disappointed and sorry for him after that ; and , not to annoy him , no one goes out . They stay in the room with him , all of them , and in their midst he falls asleep . He sleeps and sleeps and his snores rise and dive , cavort and turn over like fighters in the room . And waking at last at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all gone , he has forgiven them .
