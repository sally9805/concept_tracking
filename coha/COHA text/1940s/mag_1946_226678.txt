In The Year of the Dog the eleventh day of the eleventh month is an auspicious one for the offering of sacrifices ; the twelfth day favors the digging of graves , the making of coffins , and the burial of the dead . On the night of Nov. 11 , 36 black-robed Taoist priests gathered in the compound of Peiping 's ancient and beautiful Paiyunkuan ( White Cloud temple ) . They had come to sit in judgment , and to propitiate the Taoist gods . <P> From their monastic quarters near the main temple , the priests dragged the abbot of Paiyunkuan , An Shih-lin , and his favorite priest , Pai Chin-yi . In the flickering light of oil lamps , a bitter trial began . The priestly jury found the abbot and his henchman guilty of illegal relations with women ( kept in a house beyond the temple walls ) ; of squandering temple funds ( to buy heroin ) ; and of starving two Chinese because they refused to collaborate with the Japs . <P> Soon after midnight , as the lamps burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quicklime and bound hand &; foot . They were stretched on a pyre of straw , twigs and wood outside the temple doors , saturated with gasoline , and set on fire . Long black shadows danced against the surrounding trees , and a strange perfume infused the darkness above the crackling bonfire . <P> As the bodies cooled and dawn of the twelfth day , the day of burial , began to streak the temple walls , the priests carried the charred remnants of the abbot and his aide to a pair of graves a li away . The 36 judges and executioners listed the dead men 's crimes on a great sheet of yellow paper and nailed it near the temple doors . Solemnly , then , the priests surrendered to the police , said : " We have chosen to perish together . " <P> The police ( who had disregarded complaints against the abbot ) now investigated . They found public sentiment in favor of the lynching . Said a farmer : " I have very little opinion , but I think if the abbot had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he must have been bad for the priests to kill him . "
