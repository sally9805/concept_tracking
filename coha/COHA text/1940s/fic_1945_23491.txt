REPENT IN HASTE A Short Novel in Two Parts . Part II JOHN P. MARQUAND In the first part of this short novel , William Briggs , a war correspondent in the Pacific , learned piece by piece the life story of a young Navy flier , Lieutenant James K. Boyden , whom he had met at Pearl Harbor ; and Briggs promised that when he returned to New York he would look up Boyden 's family in East Orange , New Jersey  --  especially his young wife Daisy ( whom Boyden had met at Pensacola ) and the baby. ? The Editors A s THE bus moved through the Oranges , starting and stopping in the snow and dusk , Briggs could not escape the feeling that he was visiting an important place  --  the dwelling of some great man , with its furnishings still preserved intact . It was like a charabanc trip to some region in England , to some tourists ' literary shrine  --  a trip through the Holland Tunnel to the Boyden country , including a visit to the boyhood home of James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number . He could tell it by the porch and by the pitch of the roof , and by the lines which were already a little dated . He could almost believe that Boyden was watching him , telling him that it was not that house or that one , but the one with the yellow paint and with the maple tree in front of it  --  the one with the service star and the Red Cross sticker in the window . Mr. Boyden was frail , with mouse-gray hair , but he was easy to recognize because his lips curled up like Boyden 's when he smiled . He was dressed in a newly-pressed blue serge suit which Briggs imagined had been kept for particular occasions . " It 's kind of you to come on a night like this , " Mr. Boyden said . " I hope you did n't slip on the front steps . " " Oh , no , " Briggs answered , " it 's nice to see some snow . " " Let me take your coat , " Mr. Boyden said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell them that you 've come . " While Briggs stood in the parlor waiting , he could hear Mr. Boyden cross the hall and open the kitchen door . It was obvious that he would have broccoli for supper . " Carrie , " he heard Mr. Boyden say , " I guess the bus was early . " " Well , entertain him for just a minute , Philip . We 'll be right out , " Mrs. Boyden said , " and Philip ? " " Yes , Carrie . " " Did you get that bottle from the package store ? " " Yes , Carrie . " " Well , use the tall glasses  --  not those , the other ones . " MHE OVERSTUFFED parlor suite , the I antimacassars , the radio with the Jacobean legs , the upright piano , and the golden oak bookcase with the set of Conrad were so exactly what they should have been that the room in which Briggs stood , and all its furnishings , seemed like a projection of his own imaginative efforts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing the eye to a silver-framed photograph that stood upon a small lace-covered table . It was , of course , a picture of Boyden , standing full length in Navy khaki , wearing all his decorations . It had obviously been done by a Honolulu photographer who had no time for nuances ; in fact , you could almost hear the photographer saying : " Stand there , Buddy , and hold it . There 's a long line waiting . Now , come and get it tomorrow morning . . . Five dollars ' deposit , please . " The lighting was pitiless , but the effect was amazingly lifelike . You could sec from his round eyes that Boyden did not want to have the damned thing taken and that he must have given his hair a quick shove from his forehead an instant before the shutter clicked , for his right hand was still in mid-air with its fingers half opened . Briggs was sure that Boyden had been about to speak . Words seemed to come from his half-parted lips . You could almost hear him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm busy myself . " When Mr. Boyden returned , Briggs was still looking at the photograph . " There 's Jimmy . It 's a speaking likeness , is n't it ? " Mr. Boyden said . He was carrying a black tray with lace over it . There was a pink bowl on the tray filled with ice cubes , and three glasses , one bottle of whiskey and one of soda . " Jimmy often wrote about you . " Mr. Boyden raised his glass and looked at it uncertainly . " He said he talked to you a lot . " Briggs laughed . " He used to call me Pops . " " Jimmy always had fresh names for everybody , " Mr. Boyden said . " He gave me a message to give you , " Briggs said . " He wanted me to tell you that you 're a damned good guy . Those are his words , not mine . " " Thanks , " Mr. Boyden said , and his voice broke . " Excuse me , well  --  yesJimmy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seeing him before long , " Briggs said . " He 'll want to hear about everything -- particularly about Daisy . " There was silence and then Mr. Boyden cleared his throat . " Oh , yes , Daisy . She 'll be back tonight , " he said . " She left the baby with us . It 's easier having grandchildren . " " All the fun and none of the worry , " Briggs said . " What 's that ? " Mr. Boyden asked . " Oh , yes , not nearly so much worry . I wish you 'd tell me something  --  before the women come . " He stopped and a sharp sizzling sound came from the oven of that automatic stove in the kitchen . " Roast lamb , " Mr. Boyden said . " I wish you 'd tell me before they come . Did you get the impression that anything was worrying Jimmy ? " Briggs laughed uneasily . " Not Jimmy . He is n't the worrying kind , " he said . It was only that he said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes were on the picture . " Jimmy used to talk when he was worried . Well , here they are ? " Mr. Boyden smiled . " This is Mrs. Boyden , Mr. Briggs , and here 's my daughter , Susie , " and then he added for no apparent reason , " Jimmy 's sister . Now you know all the family . " r ocs believed that motherhood had become more of a cult than ever since the beginning of the war . For some reason it was generally admitted that mothers suffered more than fathers . it seemed to Briggs that Mrs. Boyden was just the sort of person who would never forget that she was an American mother , with art American son at the front . She was plump and deep-bosomed with graying auburn hair tied in a hard knot . Her face was round Eke Boyden 's and she wore pince-nez glasses , and a service pin on her purple satin afternoon dress . She would never be able to understand what her son was going through but she would be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that she had only been out in the kitchen for just a minute and that she did her own housework only because she liked to have things nice . " I hope you 're not starving , Mr. Briggs , " she said , " and please excuse our scurrying back and forth . It 's so much easier not having a maid . " " Yes , " Susie said , " there 's no one to get mad and leave when we 're late . " He had seen Susie 's picture with all of Boyden 's others , but somehow he had not realized that Susie would be short and chunky , too , like Boyden , with Boyden 's sandy eyebrows and his straight , even teeth . " I told Philip not to ask you any questions before I came , because everyone wants to hear everything , " Mrs. Boyden said . " It 's such a small world , is n't it ? And to have a real live war correspondent in the house . " Susie giggled . " He had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Philip , " Mrs. Boyden crooked her finger at Mr. Boyden , " did you forget to close the furnace ? " " No , dear , " Mr. Boyden answered . Mrs. Boyden seated herself and smoothed her satin skirt and adjusted her service pin . " Now , " she said , " let 's begin at the beginning . When did you first meet Jimmy , Mr. Briggs ? " It was what he had come to tell them , but he was wondering as he started to speak how the elder Boydens must have looked when they were younger . They were asking him to begin at the beginning , when they were the beginning . " Well , " Briggs began , " the first time I saw Jimmy was quite a while ago at Pearl Harbor after he had been picked up from a raft , but of course you know all about it . " " You really saw him then ? We have all the clippings in Jimmy 's scrapbook , " Mrs. Boyden said . " The newspapers reported it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got to know him , " Briggs went on . " We were staying at the same hotel and Jimmy asked me up to his room and told me a lot about the war . " " I bet he was drinking , " Susie said . Mrs. Boyden looked hurt . " No one in Jimmy 's position would dream of doing anything like that , especially when he had just been given the Navy Cross , would he , Mr. Briggs ? " " Well , as a matter of fact , " Briggs said , MAGAZINE " you know the flight surgeons themselves recommend that the fliers take a little something now and then . " H E STOPPED . The doorbell was ring- ing , and with the sound everything in the room had stopped . Mrs. Boyden drew a sharp breath . " It 's only Verna May and Sam , " Susie said quickly . " Do n't you remember that you asked them over ? Do n't worry , Mom . " " Oh , yes . " Mrs. Boyden said and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , Miss Lewis , is a childhood friend of Jimmy 's , Mr. Briggs , and her fiance , Sergeant Tilton , was one of Jimmy 's old friends , too . . . . I always think it may be a telegram . " " Oh , yes , " Briggs said , " I 've heard of Verna May , but I had n't heard ? " " It has n't been announced yet , " Mrs. Boyden said hastily . He was shaking hands with Verna May and he remembered that Boyden had called her a cute little trick , but it was not a good description . She was the sort of girl that a mother would want her son to marry  --  a tall reliable girl , with a clear complexion , nice hands , and straight shoulders . Her cheeks were red from the cold . Her nose was thin and so was her mouth . " I hope we have n't missed anything , " said Verna May . " Oh , not a thing , dear , " Mrs. Boyden said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant Tilton . " Then he was shaking hands with Sam Tilton who had taught Boyden so much about women . Sam was a technical sergeant in a tailor-made uniform . His eyes , behind metal-framed glasses , were limpid brown . He had slick hair , and a quick , easy smile . " Sam , " Mr. Boyden said , " how about a little Scotch ? " " Oh , no , " Verna May said . " Not anything for Sam . " " Thanks just the same , " Sam said hoarsely . " I 'm sort of off it , Mr. Boyden . " " Carrie , " Mr. Boyden cleared his throat again , " do n't you think we ought to call up Daisy ? " Briggs was aware of the same sort of silence that had fallen on the room when the bell had rung . " Philip , " Mrs. Boyden said , " we 've been all over that . " Then Briggs remembered Boyden 's souvenirs . They were wrapped in a brown paper package , and everyone watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he were performing a conjuring trick . The souvenirs were the sort that anyone might pick up on a battlefield  --  a Japanese soldier 's diary which should have been given to the Intelligence , a pile of Japanese bills , a canteen , a revolver , a clock from a Japanese plane , and a silk battle flag . " You do n't think they have disease germs ? " Mrs. Boyden asked . " I choose the flag , " called Susie . " Silly  --  that 's for Daisy , of course , " said Verna May . " You 'll get me a flag , too , wo n't you , Sam , when you go to the Pacific ? " " Sure , " Sam said , " right off Hirohito , Verna . " MHE DINING room told its own mute I story of unmitigated effort . There was a tablecloth of Italian lace that could not have been used for years , as Briggs could tell from the slight discoloration at the folds . There was a mirror centerpiece , with two glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a cut-glass bowl filled with snapdragons and ferns . The place plates were the color of Paris green and on each plate were figures of fox-hunters in pink coats . There were heavy tumblers of hand cut glass , and pinkish-purple wineglasses , and lace-edged napkins each with a little piece of bread inside it . There were butter plates and small plates of salad , each containing four grapefruit sections , a single leaf of lettuce , one prune stuffed with cream cheese , one red and one green Maraschino cherry and a dab of mayonnaise . Briggs pulled out Mrs. Boyden 's chair , and then they waited while the two girls brought in yellow bouillon cups of clear consomme from the kitchen . " I 'm going to ask Mr. Briggs to say the blessing , " Mrs. Boyden said . Briggs recalled what Boyden had said I about the Altar Guild and his thoughts moved desperately to memories of the last church supper he had attended , but he could not recollect the words of any grace . The last religious words he had heard were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant he could see the crew detail with their rifles , the chaplain in his robes with his Book of Common Prayer , and the body on the grating underneath the flag . " 0 , Lord , " he began , and stopped . His voice was hoarse and the palms of his hands were moist . " 0 , Lord , bless this food for thy servants ' use , Amen . " He was not sure that it was adequate but it was near enough . His hand groped for a round bouillon spoon . " You might pass the claret , Philip , " Mrs. Boyden said . " I see you looking at the swans , Mr. Briggs . Jimmy gave them to me for Christmas once . He knew that I like to have things nice . " " Oh , " Verna May said . " Why , I was with Jimmy when he bought them . We knew that you liked crystal . " " No thanks , Mr. Boyden , " Briggs heard Sam Tilton say . " I 'm kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Headquarters now , " Verna May told them . " He 's in charge of all the mimeographing . " Mrs. Boyden picked up her bouillon spoon and smiled at Briggs . " You must n't mind if the girls pop up and down , but please tell us all about Jimmy . " When Briggs began he knew he would be fitting everything he told into terms of the Boydens ' dining room  --  minimizing the danger , making it all sound comfortable and reassuring . It was a beautiful sight to see the planes take off and circle above the ship . Jimmy was a fine pilot . The thing to remember was that the Japanese fleet was no longer the menace that it used to be . He was aware of the lamb with browned potatoes and brown gravy , and mint jelly and broccoli and Hollandaise , and vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce and lady fingers . Life on a carrier was not always exciting . A lot of the time it was like a southern cruise , with the boys in shorts taking sunbaths . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundry , and moving pictures , and the food right here was almost but not quite as good as the carrier food . They had their own ice cream machine . True , there were moments of excitement , especially when a task force was near the Japanese Islands . There were occasional plane attacks and there were , just as you read in the papers , the Divine Wind planes , or the " One-way Boys , " as they were sometimes called , but the thing to remember was that these attacks were all over in a matter of seconds . " Not nearly as bad as you might think , " he heard himself saying . There was always the air cover and the radar always picked them up . And the Rogue River was a lucky ship . Briggs knew that he was doing well . He was telling them what they wanted most to hear . " My main impression on the Rogue River ; " he was saying , " was of everyone 's being friendly and having a good time . " Maybe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And maybe they did n't - know how good he was at card tricks and sleight-of-hand . He was the life of the party there on the Rogue River , " Girls , " Mrs. Boyden said , " I think it might be nice to have our demi-tasses in the parlor , but do n't stop talking , Mr. Briggs . " When they were back in the parlor , Mr. Boyden gave him a cigar in a cellophane wrapper , and Briggs finished it while he went on talking . He was trying to think of amusing anecdotes . It was amusing to hear the boys talking over the interphones when the squadron was in the air . You could hear the air fights sometimes right there on the island  --  the superstructure of the ship , not a real island . Of course , planes were forced down at sea occasionally as Jimmy 's had been that time , but you would be amazed at the high percentage of rescues . " They have it down to a system , " he heard himself saying , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W HEN HE finished his cigar he rose and said that he was afraid that he had been talking too much and that he really had to be going . He wondered if they could tell him where Maple Streetwas . Jimmy would never forgive him if he did not call at Maple Street . " Of course , " Mrs. Boyden said . " It 's been very selfish of us . We could n't get Daisy for supper , you know , but I 'm sure she 'll be back by now . We might send Daisy some ice cream , do n't you think so , Philip ? " " What 's that ? " Mr. Boyden asked . " Oh , yes , of course he must . see Daisy . He can see her and get the eleven o'clock bus . I 'll walk to the corner with him . " Then Mrs. Boyden thought of something else . She must have thought of it while Verna May was saying how wonderful it had been just to sit and listen . " It certainly was great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear all that about old Jimmy , right from the horse 's mouth . " " Why , we 've forgotten the most important thing , " Mrs , Boyden cried . " We 've forgotten all about Baby . " " Oh , " Verna May said , " has n't he seen him ? " " We can all go up , " Mrs. Boyden said . " I 'll lead the way and you follow me , Mr. Briggs , and you 'll excuse it if things are a little higgledy-piggledy upstairs  --  you know how things are with a baby . " Everyone walked into the hall and began moving up the narrow stairs in single file . " You see , Daisy leaves him with us sometimes , " Mrs. Boyden whispered . " She knows we love it so and she forgets formulas sometimes . She says herself she 's not very good with babies . " . The narrow hall upstairs was lit by a dim electric light and had that odor which one associates with extreme youth . " You must tell Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Boyden whispered . " It 's almost like having Jimmy all over , all the fun and none of the bother . " The door squeaked faintly as Mrs. Boyden opened it and stepped into the dark . She switched on a shaded light , and Briggs followed her into the little room where Boyden used to sleep . He could see the picture of the high school class and the fraternity in the faint light , and a banner on the wall with the numerals of Boyden 's college class . He could see Boyden 's bureau with a pair of military brushes on it . The baby was sleeping in a basket in Boyden 's narrow bed , and beside the bed was a combination bathtub and changing table , and a pile of diapers and a bottle warmer . " Hush , " Mrs. Boyden whispered . " He looks just the way Jimmykins looked  --  not like his mama at all . " But all that Briggs could see was a round and pasty baby with arms thrown upward and fists clenched , pale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exuding a faint odor of sour milk . " Susie , " Mrs. Boyden whispered . " Do n't forget to take him up in half an hour . " O LITSIDE IT had stopped snowing and the air was clear as it always was after snow . " This ought to be the last snowstorm , " Mr. Boyden said . " There 's been a lot of snow this winter . " They stopped under a street lamp at the corner and Mr. Boyden thrust his hands into his overcoat pockets . " You see . . . " he said , and he hesitated and began again . " I wish Mrs. Boyden and Susie got on better with Jim 's wife , not that you need tell him , but you know how women are . . . a little jealous , sometimes . I suppose you must have noticed , or I would n't have brought it up . " Briggs did not know what to answer . " It 's the strain , " Mr. Boyden added . " You saw . . . when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Neither of them moved , and Mr. Boyden spoke again . " I ca n't thank you enough for telling us so much . " " It was a pleasure , " Briggs said , " the least I could do . " " Two blocks down and to the left , " Mr. Boyden said , " the only stucco house . It 's the downstairs apartment to the right , and the bus leaves at eleven o'clock in front of the filling station , but Daisy can take you down . Thanks again for everything , Mr. Briggs . " VII T 'S THE third house down on Maple I Street , the only double stucco house , and remember there 's a goddam funny tree in front of it  --  the only one like it there . " The street lights made luminous circles on the fresh snow , which were cut by the shadows of bare branches of maple trees . The gabled houses on their small white lawns were cold and dark , for it was getting late on Maple Street . The only stucco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind that contractors had once erected hastily for investment purposes . The tree in front , as Briggs had guessed already , was an umbrella tree , with a bare network of little branches reaching down to the snow . The lower right-hand mail box bore the name of Boyden in sprawling block letters , so there was no doubt that it was the apartment where the kid was waiting safe and sound . It was a quarter of ten o'clock , a little late to drop in suddenly , but Briggs could see lights behind the drawn shades of the downstairs windows . He thought that there would be a pause when he rang the outer bell , but instead the electric latch began to click before he had finished ringing . " Do n't slam the front door , darling . Do n't wake everybody up . " He heard Daisy whisper before he even saw her , but when he was in the hall she gave a little gasp . " Oh , my God , " Daisy said . " I thought it was someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her , so that he could only judge the expression on her face by her voice , but he remembered hearing Boyden say that Daisy always did too much at once . " I 'm sorry , " . Briggs was still speaking to the shadow of Daisy in the apartment door . " My name is Briggs . I 'm a friend of Jimmy 's . I 'm just back from the Pacific . He said he 'd written about me . I hope he did . " " Oh , yes , " she said . " Oh , yes , that 's so . Well , come on in. " 11-AHE PLACE reminded him of the hotel 1 room where he had first talked with Lieutenant Boyden . It had exactly the same sort of disorder , and the same perfunctory decoration . The walls and the woodwork were cream color and the floor was varnished golden oak , partially covered by a factory-made hooked rug decorated by a profusion of green leaves and purple flowers that clashed with the ready-made " drapes " at the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some other stockings were in one corner of a sofa , and a coat and a tiny hat were in the other corner . Ginger ale bottles and groceries and unwashed dishes and glasses were heaped on chairs and tables . " I am sorry , " Briggs said . " I should n't have dropped in like this . " " Oh , that 's all right , " Daisy said . " It 's swell that you stopped in . " She held out a thin little hand with dark red pointed fingernails , and Briggs remembered what Boyden had said about her fingers and her toes that night at Pensacola . She was smiling at him , and her blonde hair , very soft and undulating from a permanent , fell rumpled to her shoulders . Briggs stood there under the glare of the unshaded ceiling fixture , comparing a photograph with its subject , for of course he had seen her picture with Boyden 's other pictures . She looked even younger than he had imagined , too young to be worried about marriage or a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry about the facts of life . She looked like those glamour girls in the movie magazines , like Betty Grable or Veronica Lake , snapped informally at home , although you knew , if you had any sense , that their poses were far from informal . She had the same beguiling stare , the same half-parted lips just about to break into a smile , the same narrowing of the corners of the eyes . He could imagine that she was pretending she was not Daisy Boyden at all , but Lana Turner receiving an inquiring photographer . He could imagine her preparing to say that she loved simple outdoor sports and babies . " Gee , " Daisy Boyden said . " I wish I 'd known you were coming , and I 'd have put something on . " Her eyebrows were plucked to pencil lines and a wide bow of lipstick had given her one of those disdainful artificial mouths which he had noticed were the latest fash-ion . She was wearing a pink silk negligee ? wrapped over blue pajamas . It might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that romantic night  --  a little worn and spotted , but very , very pretty . " You look very nice , " Briggs said . " Gee , " she said , " well , thanks a lot ! / did n't mean to be so informal , but I can take it if you can . " " I could come back again , " Briggs said , " if you 're expecting someone . " " Oh that 's all right , " Daisy said , " he 's just a friend  --  that is , kind of . Boysic wrote me all about you , but I did n't know it would be like this . " Briggs did not know that it would be either , and furthermore , he still did not know just what it was like . " ' Boysie , " ' Briggs said . " That 's what they called him on the carrier . I did n't know you called him that . " " Me ? I made it up , and the other kids must have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered . " A name kind of goes with someoneBoysie ! Things happen in funny ways , do n't they , in this life ? " " What sort of things ? " Briggs asked . " Oh , everything , " Daisy said . " You knowing Boysie , and then seeing me like this . I do n't see you getting on with Boysie exactly , but then life is a sort of a rat-race , is n't it ? " " Yes , if you want to put it that way , " Briggs said . It was exactly the way to put it , considering Daisy and the room . " Everybody keeps coining and going , " Daisy said . " You are going back out there again , are n't you ? " " Yes , in a few weeks , " Briggs answered . " Boysie will want to hear all about you when I see him . " " Well , that 's just swell you 're going back !

" " Yes , down to Atlantic City . " Daisy took a fresh package of cigarettes from a carton on the floor and tapped it with her thin fingers . " Gosh , it really is a marathon down there . I guess you 've been seeing Boysie 's people if you heard / was away . " " Yes , " Briggs answered . " I was there for dinner . " " Oh , boy , " Daisy said , and she lighted a cigarette , " I guess you need a drink , Pops . You do n't mind if I call you Pops ? . . .

" Boysie sent you a Japanese flag , " Briggs said . " Oh , " Daisy said , " was n't that angelic of Boysie ? " He had never known anyone like her , but he was beginning to understand what Boyden meant when he had said she was a cute little trick . She had so little to conceal . If he had been Boyden 's age , he might also have started talking to her about life and love . " Gosh , but things move fast . Do they ever get you all mixed up ? " Daisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saucepan and it clattered to the floor . " Yes , " Briggs answered , " sometimes . " " Just throw the coat and hat over on the floor , " Daisy said , when they were back in the living room . " Sometimes it makes me dizzy the way things happen . Sometimes , I do n't know where I am after being around so much . it 's funny , being in love . " " The thing to remember , " Briggs said , and he was beginning to see what it must have been like at Pensacola , " is that everybody 's been in the same boat sometime . " D AISY SAT down on a corner of the sofa , and curled her legs under her . " I guess we 'd better have a little talk about Boysie , " she said . " Maybe you can see  --  I need someone who can see what I 'm going through . Boysie used to say I did too many things at once . You ca n't help what life makes you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't , " Briggs answered gently . " But you must not let it bother you . It ought to help to remember that Boysie 's very fond of you . He thinks of you a lot . " At first he thought she had not heard him . She looked straight ahead of her at nothing , and clasped and unclasped her hands . " I know . He thinks of me the way I used to be , but you ca n't stay still . " She stopped and sighed . " Oh , boy , he used to be a sweet kid . I guess I 've got to have someone around loving me the way he did . Some girls are made that way . " Ycs , Briggs thought , some girls were made that way . All at once her voice had a tinkling ringing quality like the sound that came when you tapped the edge of a delicate glass and if you tapped the glass too hard it would break . " Listen , " Briggs said uneasily , " I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had never intended to be plunged into Daisy 's private lift , and he hoped that if he did not look at her he might somehow avoid it . She had turned toward him slowly , and he was afraid that she was going to cry . " If we could have only always been around together . . . . We had the sweetest time . When Boysie left me here , Oh God . . . it was awful . " " Now , wait a minute , " Briggs said hastily , " it will be all right when he comes back . " " No , it wo n't , " he heard her say . " I do n't love him any more . . . but I tried . I wish you 'd tell him that . I really tried . " Boyden was right . When there was a war on you should n't get to liking anyone too much .

You ca n't help what happens in this life . I do n't Jove Boysie any more . I 'm engaged to someone else . " " You 're what ? " Briggs asked . " I 'm engaged to someone else  --  to the man I was engaged to before I saw Jimmy . " " Now wait a minute , " Briggs began , " you ca n't be engaged to one boy when you 're married to another . " " Oh yes , I can , " Daisy said , " a lot of girls are now . I wish you 'd see . " Her voice was higher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his dullness . " Someone 's got to explain it to Boysie .

I thought I was in love with Boysie , but I really was n't . Boysie thought he was in love with someone else and he really was n't . " " If it 's all the same with you , " Briggs said , " ca n't you stop talking about love ? " but Daisy was not listening . " You ca n't tell what 's going to happen when you get married . I could n't know what being married to Boysie was like until I tried it , could I ? . . . and I did n't know what it would be like having a baby either . " " People do have babies when they 're married , " Briggs began . " But you ca n't tell what it 's like until you have one , " Daisy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and I did n't know how it would be when Hugh came back . " " Who 's Hugh , " Briggs asked , " the other boy ? " " Yes , " Daisy said , " you 'll like him when you see him . He 's a good deal like Boysie only more so . That 's what fooled me  --  only . . " " Only , what ? " Briggs asked . " I do n't know , " Daisy said . " Just only . You ca n't tell what 's going to happen when you get married in a war . " " That 's true , " Briggs said , " I suppose it is the war . " The corners of Daisy 's eyes wrinkled and she smiled . " That 's sweet of you to say that , " she said . " I knew you 'd see . And you can see that I 've got to marry Hugh , ca n't you , and you can make Boysie see ? " There was no use telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer sure what he thought , and certainly he was never meant to be a Voice of Experience , or an Old Friend of the Family . " Do you mean to say , " Briggs asked , " that you expect me to tell all this to Boysie ? " " I think it would be kinder , do n't you , " Daisy said , " than writing to him and asking right out for a divorce ? " " But ca n't you wait until he gets back on leave again ? " Briggs asked . " You 're the one who ought to tell him . " " It would be nicer , " Daisy said , " but you see I ca n't wait very well . You see , I think  --  something must have gone wrong somewhere  --  I think I 'm going to have another baby . " Briggs glanced helplessly about the room and its disorder was just like Daisy 's mind . He rose and picked up his overcoat . " I do n't know why , " he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but a buzzing sound in the kitchen stopped him , and Daisy was on her feet , the heels of her mules clattering as she ran . " Here 's Hugh , " she said . H E HAD read about this sort of thing in social workers ' notes . Mrs. B , Naval officer 's wife , unstable background ; rudimentary education ; emotionally immature ; unable to adapt herself to new environment ; has child , quarrels with husband 's family ; has now formed connection with other Naval officer ; believes is about to have child by this man . . . . Those facts would not have surprised him if he had read them on a file card . He would have said it was war psychosis and have let it go at that , but it was not the same when he sat there and observed it . " Do n't slam the front door , darling , " Daisy whispered .

He comment , or to show the way he felt , felt surry for Lieutenant Kroll. but suddenly his distaste for the whole " Well , whether it 's so or not , " he said , shabby picture and his respect for Boyden 's " you were n't married to her , were you , homely and fundamental virtues over son ?

" He 's got to take it . " Briggs walked to the door . " Well , good-bye , " he said . " I hope he 'll think he 's lucky . " That was what came of knowing people too well and liking them too much . The sordid little tale was on his hands . By accident and beyond all help he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would have to see the change come over Boyden 's face and watch him take it . He had thought that he was tolerant and knew the world . He never thought he could feel so unhappy over something that was no real concern of his . VIII N EW YORK was a very rear area compared to San Francisco . The war tide swirled up and down the streets of San Francisco like the tide in the Golden Gate . Marines and sailors dozed in the hotel lobbies , and everyone was taking a last drink before leaving , or a first drink on coming back . In the room at the St. Francis on the night before Briggs left for Pearl , everyone knew what had happened to the Rogue River , although it was not yet in the papers for reasons of security . Personally , Briggs could not sec much use in the delay when so many people knew of it already , and what was left of the Rogue River was back at Pearl and her surviving crew were landed . " Some damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said . Briggs had heard about it in Washington , a week before he left , from a friend of his in Naval Personnel , but news was like waves from a stone thrown into water  --  the nearer you came to the spot the more you heard . The captain and the two commanders who sat in his room at the St. Francis knew him well enough to talk freely . The carriers were usually the ones that caught it , particularly when there was an overcast , and the Rogue River had been under intermittent attacks for days . A Zeke had come out of the overcast flying low and had made for the superstructure when a five-MAGAZINE inch shell made it swerve and crash on the flight deck among the planes . The explosion had smashed through to the hangar deck and the ship had been on fire for an hour . It had taken nearly all the ocean to put it out , the captain said . It was surprising to think that anything like the Rogue River could have got back under her own power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped below deck , but , though it would take quite a while to patch her up , she made port . They spoke quietly in technical terms , much as he had heard doctors discuss a case of thrombosis . " They used to say she was a lucky ship , " Briggs said . " Yes , " the captain answered , " but no ship stays lucky all the time . " Briggs was thinking of the wardroom of the Rogue River , of the officers drinking coffee and listening to the phonograph , reading , or writing letters . He was thinking of Boyden sitting at a bridge game , and of the annoying way he slapped down his cards , particularly when he took a trick . " Hey , " he heard them say . " What are you playing  --  slapjack , Boysie ? " " Hell , " he heard Boyden answer , " I want to know it when I take ' em . " Of course there was a casualty list , but no one there had seen it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been briefed and a lot of them were by their planes when the Zeke had crashed . " There was a flier , " Briggs said , " named Boyden  --  James K. Boyden . " " If he 's alive , you 'll see him , " one of the commanders said . " Those kids all went to Pearl . " That was all there was to say about Boyden . He was nothing but a name , and he had been checked off on the record . " He was a very nice kid , " Briggs said . " His wife 's leaving him . He does n't know it yet . " " Those kids are always mixed up , " the captain said . " They always marry some little floozie before they think about it . Now when I was in Jacksonville there were two kids . . . " the captain 's voice went on and Boyden 's name and personality were gone . H UMAN VALUESand relationships were changing already . It was infinitely simple going back . He knew exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The preoccupations and reserves of home were gone already  --  tied up in a package and checked somewhere , to be called for later . Possessions , insurance , old friendships , money in the bank , old ambitions , how to educate the children , whether to sell the house or not , whether to move or not  --  all these things were packed away and the memory of them was growing uncertain . Yet they were not entirely forgotten . The commander was explaining how much gas his car used back at home , and the captain had been very lucky in raising delphiniums . The way he did it , he said , was by giving the matter a little study . He did not just go around and ask the neighbors how to raise delphiniums . It was refreshing to speak of such extraneous subjects but it was much more important to know what to take with you . The clothing situation was not bad at all in the West Pacific . There were plenty of shoes at Guam , but it was hard to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take some good sun glasses and a decent fountain pen . You could get everything else at Guam . If you had any room in your luggage , it was good to take along some Scotch . That would help you more than any other equipment , Scotch and something to read , if you did n't want to spend all your spare time with paper-covered books . " Well , " the captain said , " we 'd better turn in . The car will take us to Alameda at six . " " You say those fliers on the Rogue are back at Pearl ? " Briggs asked again . " Yes , " the commander answered , and he yawned . " They 're waiting there for orders . " " God , they must be tearing that room to pieces next door , " the captain said . " They 're really taking it apart . I hope we can get some sleep . " PrIlHE BEAUTY of it was that you could I do nothing much about it . William Briggs was aware of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much one could forget for a while when the motors began turning . The weather over the bay was overcast , so that it was hard to see the city when they circled for altitude , but once they were an hour offshore they were in the morning sun and the sea was blue beneath them , and home was left in space . Now that they were moving toward the islands , he could think of Boyden and his problems in a very different way . It might be that Boyden was already gone and that he would never know what had happened back at home , gone with all his simple thoughts , never to receive the messages which Briggs was carrying . " Just tell him that we all love him , " Mrs. Boyden was saying . He remembered that she was crying when she said it . " That 's what he 'll need most . He 'll need a mother now . " It still seemed to him doubtful , but it was just as well that she thought he would . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the truth , " Susie was saying . " He 'll know it 's better , when he knows the way it really is . " " Tell him we 're looking after everything , " Mr. Boyden was saying . " He does n't need to worry about any of the details . Tell him we 've got a good lawyer . Make him understand that everybody is on his side and be sure he does n't blame himself . Tell him this sort of thing is happening all the time . " " Tell him how much better it is , " Daisy was saying , " than if we went on without my really loving him . It 's the only way that 's honest . Tell him that . " " Tell him that he is only a kid after all , " Mr. Boyden said . " We all make mistakes at his age . " " Tell him we love him , " Mrs. Boyden was still crying . " Tell him that it will all be just as though it never happened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were saying . " Tell him he has all his life to live . " Briggs remembered what the chaplain had said on the transport at Guam but there was no way of explaining to the Boydens that their son might have lived a good many lives already and that anyone like Boyden might easily grow tired of living . Briggs began repeating to himself , as he had a great many times before , the sort of speech that he would have to make . " Listen , son , " Briggs would say , " there 's been a little trouble back at home . Not anything that is going to hurt you indefinitely , but you 'd better hold onto your seat and brace yourself . Just remember this sort of thing is always happening . . . . " I T wAs three-quarters of an hour before sundown when the plane approached the air base . First he saw Diamond Head and the palms along Waikiki Beach , then the docks and houses of Honolulu . The rain clouds hung over the mountains but all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a map of mottled greens  - -  except for the gashes made by the supply dumps and the airstrips . He had a glimpse of Pearl Harbor full of shipping and then all the airfield installations and the rows of planes . He watched the nervous expression on a flier 's face beside him as they waited for the wheels to touch . Those boys were always critical of any other pilot 's work . When he stepped to the ground he started straight for the enclosure where the incoming passengers would be checked , without bothering to look around him , and he almost ran into Lieutenant Boyden before he saw him . He was not even sure that he expected to see Boyden at all . He had thought of inquiries and delays and of long waits while officers consulted files . At any rate , whatever he had been thinking , the sight of Boyden was a shock . His face leaped out at Briggs from the faces of a group of officers who were standing in front of the Administration Building . " Hey , " Lieutenant Boyden said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know me , Pops ? " His shirt was riding out of his trousers . His tie had slid a trifle sideways . The uppers were out from his boots and his socks sagged over them . It was Boyden 's way of showing , without using ribbons , that he was in the category of old fliers who came from places where dress was not important . Everything about Boyden was exactly as Briggs remembered , the way he held his head , the way he shook hands . MAGAZINE " I never thought I 'd see you here , " Briggs said . Boyden smiled and shrugged his right shoulder and pushed his shirt beneath his belt . " Why , hell  --  I 've been waiting for you , " he answered . " They let me call home the other night . Daisy 's phone was disconnected but I got the folks . " Boyden cupped his hands in front of his mouth . " Hello , Papa . Hello , Mama . Hello , everybody . This is Jimmy back for a little rest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . The word was you might be in tonight . Cripcs , I 'm glad to see you , Pops . " Boyden slapped him on the back . " They say Daisy 's away visiting , but they say you saw her , Pops . " " Yes , " Briggs began . " She 's a cute kid , is n't she ? " Boyden said . " I got you a corner room at the hotel . If you want service around here , just ask Boyden . I 've got a jeep . Where 's that driver ? Hey -- -where are you , Chief ? " PVIIEY walked through the building out 1 to the parking space and a chief petty officer carried the bags . He tossed them onto the jeep and they climbed in beside them . Boyden was still talking . " Downtown , Chief , " Boyden was saying . " It seems that some of us kids need a little rest and relaxation , Pops . It seems we 're a little tired . " But there was no sign of strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week ago , " Boyden was saying . " Boy-oh-boy ! And we start in next Monday at Barber 's Point breaking in new kids . Boy-oh-boy -- you should have been there , Pop . " They were on the road to Honolulu , with the sky behind them red from the sunset . They were moving past the supply dumps and the Marine camp . The sound of the traffic rose in waves around them , so that it was hard to talk . " Everything looks about the same , " Briggs said . " Sure . " Boyden answered , " how else do you think it would look ? " There were the same trucks , the same buses , the same tents , the same heaps of ammunition , the same military police , the same shacks and open shops as they neared Nuuanu stream , and the same crowds of soldiers and sailors  --  drifting through the streets . " We 'll eat at The Outrigger , " Boyden said . " All right , son , " Briggs answered . Now that the first minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long while . " But first we 'll get squared away and have a drink . " Boyden was looking at him through the gathering dark . " You sound kind of tired , Pops . " " It 's the plane , " Briggs said . He still felt the vibration of the plane . " I 'm glad to see you , son . You 're all right , are n't you ? " " What the hell , " said Boyden . always all right . Say ? " " What ? " Briggs asked . " You should have been aboard . Oh , baby . You missed it , Pops . " It must have been pretty bad if it still intruded upon Boyden 's thoughts . " I hope you 'll tell me about it tonight , " Briggs said . " Boy-oh-boy , " Boyden said , and he began to laugh . " Do you remember Jonesy ? " Briggs tried to think but he could not remember anyone named Jonesy . " Comical things happen , " Boyden said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed sitting down facing each other . It 's comical the way those things happen . " " It must have been bad , " Briggs said . " Hell , " Boyden said . " It 's just some more of the same damn thing . Did you bring any Scotch out , Pop ? " Boyden was right  --  war was nothing but a repetition , a series of the same anecdotes that grew monotonous with the telling . The phenomena of explosion and of gunfire never varied . Fires burned in the same manner and ships sank like other ships . Infantry took the same sort of cover and planes fell in flames through the same pull of gravity . One could take that repetition just so long , and then finally one grew tired . It was not a weariness induced by fear as much as by boredom , the weariness of complete acceptance . They had even coined a word for it , and the word , oddly enough , was " happy . " One got bomb-happy or slap-happy if one stayed too long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference . It seemed to Briggs that Boyden was near the edge of it , though externally he looked just the same . La s SEE , " Boyden said when they were in the hotel . " I 've got the key . I 'm using the other sack here . I hope you do n't mind , Pop . " The windows of the hotel room were open and the sound of the surf came up to them . Briggs could still see the outline of Diamond Head before Boyden switched on the lights . " Come on , " Boyden said , " break out that Scotch . " He held the bottle in his hand , turning it slowly , peering at it from every angle . " Gripes , " he said . " Black Label . That 's worth about fifty bucks downtown . If you want something enough , it does n't matter what you pay for it , does it ? " " No , as long as you 're sure you really want it , " Briggs answered . " Nuts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , you 're sure you want it , at least in my experience , and to hell with later , Pop . " It was only a step to The Outrigger Club . They walked past the old Hawaiian woman who sat in front of the hotel selling her tuberose leis , past the bookshop and past the souvenir shop that was offering " things Hawaiian " ? shells and gourds and pieces of tapa cloth and brooches , and grass-skirted dolls . Boyden slackened his pace , and frowned at the objects in the window . " It 's a very funny thing , " he said . " What 's a funny thing ? " Briggs asked him . Boyden took a few quick steps before he answered . " Looking at all that junk , " he said . " I do n't seem to get used to being here . I do n't get the old wham-wham out of it ; and The Outrigger has n't got the old wham-wham . Do you see what I mean ? " " Listen , son , " Briggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Who said I was bothering ? " Boyden asked . " It 's a perfectly normal reaction . Everyone reacts like that for a while , but it 's the timing . I still keep expecting to snap back . " PVHE Room upstairs at The Outrigger I was already crowded with a few girls and a few civilians , but mostly Naval officers . " There arc a lot of new kids here , " Boyden said . " It makes me kind of tired looking at all these new kids  --  all full of the old wham-wham . It 's a very funny thing . I keep thinking I 'm back on the Rogue . It seems more real than here . It 's taking longer to snap back . " As Boyden tried inexpertly to express himself , his words had a clumsy eloquence . He talked of the Rogue Ricer as he ate . There had been a swell crowd of kids aboard and Boyden had been " in . " He knew he had been in , as soon as that blast had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found he was all right , he knew he did not have to bother about himself . It was the other kids that bothered him . " Seeing them shot down , " he said , " is different from seeing a whole lot of kids catch it on deck ; and kids shut in up forward , burning up  --  oh boy . " You had your mind on other things when the ready ammunition magazines began exploding , but cleaning up afterwards  --  oh boy ! Boyden put his hands on the table and pushed his chair back , " Let 's get squared away , " he said , " and get back and polish off that Scotch . " Suddenly he seemed to be in a hurry to leave . It was almost as though he had seen someone he did not want to meet , but when they were out on the street again he walked more slowly . " Gee , " he finally said , " I 'm sorry , for being in a mood . How are tricks in Orange , Pops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Japanese elevator boy in his blue monkey jacket , Briggs knew of course that they would have to come to it eventually , but he wished that Boyden would not keep watching him . " Orange ? " Briggs said cheerfully . " Oh , yes , /11 tell you in a minute . " The elevator door clicked shut behind them and they walked down the hall . " I bet the old apartment was in a mess , " Boyden said . " Daisy likes disorder . What was she wearing , Pop ? " An orchestra was playing downstairs , and Briggs could hear gay voices and MAGAZINE the clink of ice through open transoms . " She was wearing a pink silk wrapper and blue pajamas . " " That kid never gets out of pajamas , if she can help it , " Boyden laughed , and took out the room key . " And how 's the little number ? Can he talk yet ? " " No , not yet , " Briggs said , " but he 's looking fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd like to see that kid . " DOYDEN closed the door behind them and D took off his shirt . " Let 's take the whiskey straight , " he said . " It 's too good for soda . Here 's looking at you , Pops . " Briggs sat down heavily in an armchair . " It was funny , hearing them the other night , " Boyden said . " It all came through just as though they were in the room . It 's funny thinking of you just seeing them and all of them just being there . When ? " Boyden stopped and rubbed the back of his head . " When what , son ? " Briggs asked . " That 's the trouble , " Boyden said , and he held up his glass and shook it . " I do n't know just what . I 've got a hunch that I 'm not quite in . Something is n't quite right , is it ? You 'd better give me the word , Pops . " Boyden looped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke again before Briggs had time to answer . " You get a mood . You get so you know whether you 're in or not . You 'd better give me the word , Pops . " Briggs grasped the arms of his chair carefully . " Listen , son , " he began slowly , and his voice sounded unnatural . " I remember something you said once . You do n't want to get to liking anyone too much . " Boyden pulled his thumbs more tightly against his belt . " That 's so , " he said . " Not out here you do n't . Because what good does it do ? " " You ca n't help it sometimes , " Briggs said slowly . " I ca n't help it that I like you , son . " " Listen , Pop , I appreciate that , " Boyden said gently . " Thanks a lot , but you do n't have to take it this way . What 's the word ? " T HERE HAn been a time , Briggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught Boyden less than nothing , and now he felt that somehow , somewhere , Boyden had learned something that he had not . Suddenly Boyden seemed older than he and much wiser . Suddenly Briggs seemed to be the one who was in trouble . " I want you to try to think , " Briggs began again . " I want you to try and use your head and not your emotions . Just try ? " Briggs squirmed uneasily in his chair and stood up . " just try to remember . . . You 're mighty young , son . I know the way this sounds to you , but I 'm pretty nearly old enough to be your father . " Briggs tried to smile but he could not . " In fact , I could have been your father if I had been married at around your age . We 've been around quite a lot together , not in terms of time , but we 've been around . I know the way this sounds but I want you to believe ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very gentle . " Do n't mind me , go ahead and spill it , Pop . " " Just try to get it through your head , " Briggs said , " that nothing that happens to you at your age matters as much as it does later . There 's always a chance at your age . I guess nature takes care of that . So you must n't think what I 'm going to tell you is going to be the end of the world . On the contrary , " Briggs forced himself to smile , " maybe you 're in luck . Maybe it 's a good thing that this is happening to you now . " Boyden moved his feet a trifle further apart as though he were on a deck and compensating for the motion . " Roger , " Boyden said , very quietly . He was using the flier 's phrase of complete agreement . " I knew I had a hunch . Has Daisy been cheating , Pop ? " No definite expression was left on Boyden 's face . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have felt . " Yes , that 's it , " Briggs said . He paused , but Boyden 's face was still intent and blank . " There is n't any way of keeping it from you . I wish I did n't have to tell you , son . " Boyden moved very slowly to a straightbacked chair . He leaned one hand against it , and then he sat down slowly as though a sudden lurch might disturb his balance . " Roger , " he said . " I 've got it . Roger . Do n't take it so hard , Pops . You 've shot the works . You 're in . I 'm taking over now . All you have to do is just tell me . " He pointed to the whiskey bottle . " You 'd better take a slug of that . You look as though you need it , Pops . " " Now , just try to remember , " Briggs began , but Boyden raised his hand . " No , " he said . " Relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough on you , and thanks a lot . " " Tough on me ? " Briggs repeated . " Yes , " Boyden said . " Let 's keep this straight . This is one place and Orange is another . Let 's try not to mix them . " Boyden put his hands on his knees and his shoulders relaxed . " It does n't pay to like any guy too much . Do n't think about me and do n't pull your punches , Pop . " Briggs had never realized till then that Boyden really did live by a few simple phrases . Boyden was wiser than he , or at least he had achieved a working philosophy . Again Briggs felt as if he were telling his own troubles to an older man . Boyden listened , nodding sometimes , speaking sometimes . " Boy , " he said once . " Oh , boy , " and he rubbed the back of his head . His eyes narrowed slightly when he heard of Lieutenant Kroll . " So that 's the guy , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned her down . Well , well . " But Daisy had asked how anyone could make such a lousy crack as that . m osT or the time Boyden sat quietly listening and Briggs could think of his words as sinking like stones into Boy-den 's silence . He remembered what Boyden had said about his thoughts before he went to sleep , about home and when he was a kid , and the apartment on Maple Street  --  the third house down , the only double stucco house with the tree in front of it , a kind of weeping something . And when Boyden had thought of luck , he had thought of himself and Daisy . ( You got to know what love was , living in little shacks and one-night stands . ) And some-times before he went to sleep he had thought about that ride that he and Daisy had taken in that jalopy up from Florida , when nothing had been wrong , not for a single minute . All this , Briggs knew , must be lying somewhere in the depths of Boyden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so young . And Briggs could think of his words falling and breaking all those thoughts which he had once considered banal and mediocre . He could hear the surf through the open window when he had finished . " Wilco , " Boyden said . " Wilco . Out . " He was speaking in Naval parlance acknowledging an order . His voice was like a hundred other voices that Briggs had heard on the radio speaker at sea , and there was the same finality and the same incisiveness in that word ' out ' that meant those voices were gone , perhaps forever . " Say , " Boyden said suddenly , " what about Verna May ? Did you happen to see her , Pops ? " There still was Verna May . Perhaps he was thinking that that might have been real love after all . " She 's engaged , " Briggs said . " That friend of yours  --  Sam Tilton . " " The hell you say ! " Boyden said . " Oh boy . Well , Wilco  --  Out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices although he was just a few feet away . " I 'm sorry , son , " Briggs said . " Now do n't take it too hard . Just remember you made a mistake about Daisy . Anyone makes mistakes . " Boyden looked up at him . " You 're a good guy , Pops , " he said , " but do n't be too hard on Daisy . Poor kid . If I had been around ? " Boyden shook his head , " but I was n't around . Poor kid . Just remember it 's happening all the time , I guess . " It was Boyden 's voice , but they were very nearly Daisy 's words and to Boyden they seemed to explain everything . Boyden stood up and scratched himself . " Say , I wonder if I 've got the itch , " he said . " Do n't let it worry you . This does n't get me , Pop . Now there 's the kid ? " " What kid ? " Briggs asked . Boyden 's indiscriminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Boyden said . " Say , he can get the full allotment now . Dues he look like me , Pop ? " " Your mother says he does . Personally , I would n't know , " said Briggs . " Do n't get sore , " Boyden said . " What do you want me to do , cry ? " Briggs realized that a sort of a bewildered exasperation must have been reflected in his voice . " You see , it does n't get me , " Boyden said again . " It 's just as though it had happened to some other kid . It was so long ago , do you see ? Some other kid , not me . So much keeps happening . They really run you ragged in this war . " Boyden looked at his watch and shook it and held it to his ear . " The damn thing keeps stopping . How many hundred is it ? " " It 's after ten , " Briggs told him . " We ca n't go out . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can do it tomorrow , " Boyden answered . " I was just thinking . . . . There 's the cutest little trick ? " " What sort of a trick ? " Briggs asked , and Boyden corrected himself . " The cutest little kid . It 's funny the way things happen , is n't it ? " Boyden said . " I met her yesterday at the USO . She lives up at Pacific Heights . Say , you 've got to meet her . She 's really a cute trick . It 's funny the way things happen , is n't it , when there 's a war on ?
