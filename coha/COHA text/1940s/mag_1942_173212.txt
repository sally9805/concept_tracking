The U.S. , unaccustomed to dealing with the enemy within , stumbled all over its feet last week in attempting to put a handful of would-be Nazi saboteurs on trial . <P> Hitler may well have guffawed at the idea of no less than seven generals of the U.S. Army being detailed to decide the fate of eight of his lowly underlings . But the generals who were to try the eight Nazis whom U-boats jettisoned on U.S. beaches did not see the joke . <P> If the trial were to disclose any particularly clever detective methods used by the FBI in apprehending the eight Nazis , other saboteurs might be harder to catch . That much was true . But the generals developed a consuming passion for Star Chamber secrecy . Even before the trial began , no one in the Department of Justice building was allowed to admit officially that anything was going on . <P> The Generals refused the request of Elmer Davis , head of the Office of War Information , that one representative of each of the three big press associations be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They refused to let anyone from the Office of War Information prepare a digest of the proceedings . <P> Henry Paynter of OWI , trying to see Major General Frank R. McCoy , head of the trial commission , went to the floor where the trial was to be held . He was brushed off . He could not even get a message to the General . When Attorney General Biddle , on behalf of Elmer Davis , sent a note saying that Paynter wished to see the General , McCoy did not deign to answer . A second note from the Attorney General brought a terse answer : the General had nothing to say . <P> In the end Elmer Davis , to save the prestige of OWI from total destruction , had to go to Franklin Roosevelt . There he and the Secretary of War argued whether it was democratic to keep any more of a trial secret than national safety required . In the end the President of the U.S. solemnly handed down a compromise . <P> Thereafter General McCoy handed out two communiques a day solemnly announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He allowed the Army Signal Corps to take photographs and silent movies . The final act of the comedy occurred when Elmer Davis finally got eleven reporters admitted to the court room . The newshawks marched in , looked around , asked the court 's provost marshal questions in an undertone . For 15 minutes the defendants , the lawyers , the seven judges sat doing nothing-except to let the representatives of the public look . <P> At the end of the trial 's first week came the first official admission of a story long circulated in Washington and New York : that a Coast Guardsman had surprised the four saboteurs who landed on Long Island 's Amagansett Beach ; that , after they tried to bribe him into silence , he gave the alarm which put the FBI on the saboteurs ' trail . The Coast Guardsman , young , dimpled Coxswain Jack Culley , ( see cut ) told his story at the trial . <P> Ten lawyers handled the prosecution , four the defense . Significantly , one of the saboteurs ( gaunt George John Dasch ) had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned state 's evidence . As the evidence kept pouring in , General McCoy grew almost garrulous . He said it would be a long trial . <P> Meanwhile the FBI arrested eight men and six women who had aided the saboteurs . Ten of them were U.S. citizens . <P> Other encounters last week with the enemy within :
