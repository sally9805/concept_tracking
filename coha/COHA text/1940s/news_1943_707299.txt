txt Lord Louis Mountbatten , the new SuIpreme Allied Commander , Southeast Asia , arrived in Washington for conferences with the American Army and Navy chiefs today . His lips were closed tightly by official decree , but his visit gave rise to the distinct impression that talk of a grand offensive in Burma as soon as the monsoon season is ended in mid-October was . fanciful . The young and dashing Lord Louis of Commando fame met the press at an informal reception and chatted freely and forcefully , but entirely off-the record . However , certain facts attendant upon his visit led observers to believe that the vigorous Commando chief ' intends to be swashbuckling against the Japanese in Southeast Asia only when he has carefully mustered the force necessary to completely and thoroughly smother them . He intends his offensive to be a sure thing  --  not a gallant but , ill-timed gamble . The sources that built up these impressions seemed reliable to ob servers . Of course , it is entirely possible that a bit of a " smoke screen " may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong direction , and that action in Burma is nearer than Allied military leaders would have the enemy believe . However , a careful analysis of the present military situation , based on what is known of the local strength of the opposing powers and on what has happened in recent operations , favors these conclusions : 1 . There is a good possibility of local actions to keep the Japanese in Burma jittery and off-balance , but the big push is not likely to come until the Allies are ready to deliver the knockout blow . 2 . The big push may not come until the European war is over , or the defeat of Germany is more nearly in sight . These cautious observations do not preclude the possibility that local actions , which some observers seem to expect , may be of a more punishing nature than the word " local " implies . For instance , with much of the British and American fleets and much Allied shipping freed by victory in the Mediterranean , it is not out of the question that a successful assault on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waxen ' s land troops tried unsuccessfully to capture last season , might be launched . It is known , however , that the kind of amphibious operations that the 43-year-old new supreme commander favors are on a vast scale , involving the use of thousands of warships and invasion craft and perhaps hundreds of thousands of men . And such vast operations , Which , after all , are the only kind that would lead to the reopening of the Burma Road and a land and air drive that would have Tokyo as its terminus , can not be planned between a Quebec conference and the appointment a few days later of a new commander . Understanding With Chiang Capitol observers , studying the Southeast Asiatic situation , felt that Lord Louis , second cousin of ' King George and a figure of considerable prestige in the British Empire , had one major diplomatic ' Ss well as military problem on his hands . A complete understanding will have to be reached with the strong minded Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek of China , for it is obvious that China will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the combined **30;1488;TOOLONG push . The British and Chiang Kai-shek have not always seen eye-to-eye in the past  --  there were some slipups in the use of Chinese troops in the ill-fated attempt to defend Burma against the initial Japanese invasion in 1942  --  and there is reason to believe that AngloAmerican leaders want complete understanding , harmony and efficiency in the future . A still unsolved problem is just how Lieut . Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell , commander of all American Army forces in China , Burma and India , . will fit into the picture . It is quite logical to assume that Lord Louis may go to Chungking before his plans are completed , and there he will have his chance to talk with both the Generalissimo and General Stilwell . Just as Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower , Commander in Chief in North Africa and Sicily , relied heavily on British aides , it is quite likely that Lord Louis will choose some of his top-ranking officers from American ranks . It would not be at all surprising if the selection of these top aides was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. George C. Marshall , Chief of Staff of the Army , and Admiral Ernest J. King , Commander in Chief and Chief of Naval Operations of the United States Fleet . Lord Louis , tall ; handsome and extremely quick-witted and articulate , made a particularly good impression on those who saw him . He seemed to personify ? vigor and quickness of thought . At the same time he appeared to be a fighter who would rather " bloody the enemy 's nose " than have his own bloodied . As he stepped from the plane : that brought him to the capital , he made his only statement for the record : " I am very proud , " he said , " to have been appointed commander in Southeast Asia .. As you know it is an Allied command . And I am particularly proud that American and British forces will be fighting side by side with their Chinese Allies until we have thrown the Japanese out and a complete victory is won . " He left the National Airport immediately to keep an appointment with Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall . Aides of Lord Louis , who:holds the rank , among others , of ? acting Vice Admiral in the British Navy , pointed out that officers of his rank may not speak on strategical or political matters without express permission - of the Cabinet , and , since Lord Louis ' appointment was announced so quickly , there had been no time to obtain this permission . Knox Extols Appointee Lord Louis was chosen Supreme commander " because he was regarded : an the best man for that job , " Frank kitex , Secretary of the Navy , said as he returned from Quebec today . Lord Louis , added Mr. Knox , has had a " marvelous record " , es a fighting man . In discussing ; the appointment , Mr -- Knox aid- that , " of course , " the *child cooperate in the ; tight against Japan . " They have said so repeatedly and they have said that all of their forces are available to bring about the unconditional surrender of the Japanese just as soon as the enemies in Europe are Aispesed of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close ; contact with American commanders in the Southwest Pacific . Lieutenant Gen-. eral Stilwell , Commander in Chief Of American forces in the Iridia , Burma-China area , ' would continue there in " a very important capacity , " Mi .
