txt // As a profession , economists have not followed Veblen 's lead , for reasons which have already been discussed . Consequently this approach to the study of economics is still outrageously unorthodox . Nevertheless Veblen 's basic idea has become almost commonplace during the last generation or so , chiefly as the result of work in other fields . In modern studies of the social functions of language , for example , the contrast has become quite apparent between the technical , or instrumental , or denominative use of words and the ceremonial use . Indeed this distinction has become the chief preoccupation of the semanticists . Exploration of the ceremonial patterns of contemporary civilization has become the subject of a large literature . Indeed the general recognition of the ceremonial elements in present-day living is doubtless responsible for the fact that The Theory of the Leisure Class has been the most widely read and the most fully understood of Veblen 's books . Researches in the field of technology have also been contributed by a wide variety of participants . The establishment of industrial museums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention . Even the history of science has been more carefully and extensively explored in recent years than ever before , as a result , perhaps , of increasing awareness of the great responsibility of science in modern civilization . Even the fine arts have quite generally emerged from the leisure-class dilettantism which has always been their curse and become material for objective social analysis . In spite of all this , however , there is still an apparent reluctance to dichotomize the technological and ceremonial aspects of civilization . Many writers who discuss tool-using and ceremonializing as though they were the obverse and reverse of social behavior still seem to refrain from saying so . Students of science and of industrial engineering frequently hazard the assertion that it is science and engineering which // is responsible for the progress of civilization , but usually without raising the issue of the other aspect of culture . This hesitancy may express a common distrust of dualisms , distrust which is only too well justified . Metaphysical dualisms of body and mind , phenomena and noumena , the physical universe and the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our thinking . Our worst confusions have had their origins in dualism . This difficulty could be resolved if it could be clearly understood that the distinction of the technological and the ceremonial aspects of organized behavior is a dichotomy but not a dualism . That is , it undertakes to distinguish two aspects of what is still a single , continuous activity both aspects of which are present at all times . Indeed , they bound and define each other as do the obverse and reverse of a coin . Such a distinction need not and does not set up two separate realms of being such as have characterized the historic dualisms . On the contrary it is the essence of the case that these two behavior functions are not only functions of one continuous whole of human behavior but even that both employ and give expression to the same basic faculties of which all organized behavior is the expression . These two behavior functions do have widely different results on which , inevitably , very different judgments must be made . Such judgments are well-nigh universal . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself capable of the most prodigious achievements and the most abysmal follies , achievements and follies both of which have no parallel in the behavior of any other species . With a very few most rudimentary exceptions , no other species uses tools at all . We admire the labors of the ants , but they are still incomparable with the works of man . The follies of mankind are likewise incomparable . Both sets of achievements , however different in outcome , are peculiarly human . Both are works of intelligence and imagination . Both are social // accretions made possible by memory and habit , the capacity for organized behavior , the background of culture by which the behavior of successive human generations is socially organized . This does not mean that there are no differences of pattern between technological and ceremonial behavior , nor that there may not be important differences of an elementary character . But these differences certainly are not total . Both are aspects of the behavior of human beings in society . In particular it must be emphasized that both employ intelligence and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words have feeling tones ? " intelligence " one of approval , " tradition " one of disapproval . There may be a sense in which such discriminations are justified , but it is a very special sense. ? If we mean by intelligence that which is measured by an " intelligence quotient , " the behaviororganizing capacity , it is obvious that the creation of myths , the performance of sacerdotal functions , the exploitation of one 's fellows , and the commission of crime , all call for intelligence no less than the use of tools , scientific instruments , and artist 's materials . And on the other hand , while myths and ceremonies , invidious distinctions and exploitative privileges , are clearly traditional , so are tool uses , scientific formulas , and the techniques of painters and composers . That is , all are matters of cultural heritage , learned by apprenticeship as social accomplishments . The two traditions are different and the use each makes of intelligence is different ; but they are not totally different . They are not separate realms of being ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a dualism , such as the metaphysical dualism of mind and body . Once this has been established , the prevalence of dualism in the thinking of the past may perhaps be seen to be significant . Curiously enough , all the dualisms have something Footnote // in common . All make unmistakable reference to the undeniable achievements and follies of the race . Can it be possible that all have been attempts , unsuccessful perhaps because of the limitations of the intellectual heritage of the past , to understand and characterize the distinction with which we are still concerned ? The efforts of economists would seem to bear this interpretation . For the classical tradition in economics has given rise to a most pernicious dualism of the realms-of-being type . It was originally that of the " actual " and the " natural " or " normal , " but during the last half-century these realms have been known as the " dynamic " and the " static . " Contemporary economists maintain that the distinction is only an analytical device , but it is certainly more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states is existential and the other is ideal in both metaphysical and moral senses . If one be defined as the realm in which change is occurring and the other as a " stationary state , " it is at once apparent that change is regarded as something of a nuisance and as an essentially transitory condition . How otherwise could the analysis of imaginary " stationary states " be regarded as a useful analytical device ? It is useful only on the supposition that the static world is the real world and the dynamic world phenomenal in the metaphysical sense . The distinction is between " universals " and " particulars . " Nevertheless this distinction signalizes something more than the durability of medieval metaphysics . The modern economy is in fact both a triumph and a tragedy . The " restraints " of which it affords so many instances are by no means " unnatural . " Alas , the entire history of civilization is one of grueling restraints . The attempt to identify the achievements of modern economic life with the forces of " nature , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary character has been mistaken ; but the efforts to distinguish between different sets of forces and // their different sets of effects is a sound and necessary one . The differences are there . It remains to be seen whether the progress of knowledge has been sufficient to make possible another and more successful effort to deal with the perennial problem . Chapter VI TECHNOLOGY AND PROGRESS TECHNOLOGY is organized skill . As a definition this formula is both inadequate and misleading , but there is no better way to explore and clarify the meaning of technology than by discovering the inadequacies of common-sense conceptions such as this one . All skill is organized , of course , and all behavior skilled in some sense or other . We commonly distinguish between the skill of the artisan and the mastery of the scientist or the " creative " artist , and these distinctions are important . But do they distinguish between skill and non-skill ? We do not ordinarily think of the scientist or the artist as " unskilled . " However important they may be , such distinctions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performs operations which a scientist has devised . Much the same distinction is made between the artist who is a " mere " performer and one who is a " creator . " But differences appear even within the field of creation . In one of his later essays Roger Fry retracted his earlier declaration that Sargent was not an artist but repeated his earlier judgment in this form , that Sargent was an " applied " artist . The distinction was more than a slight . What Fry meant was that Sargent had adopted 105 // the color chords which the Impressionists had " created " ( or discovered , or invented ) , and had used them in painting portraits of rich sitters . Whereas Sargent , according to Fry , had " learned something " from the Impressionists , later painters stood to learn nothing from his canvases . A similar distinction is made between pure and applied science . A man who knows no mathematics is only a mechanic , however good a mechanic he may be . If he knows and uses the common branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training is sufficient to enable him to understand and reproduce the experiments of scientists , putting them to use in the fashion in which Sargent used the palette of the Impressionists in painting portraits , he is an applied scientist . If he masters the work of earlier scientists in such a way as to be able to carry it on , putting their discoveries to the same sort of use to which they in turn had put the discoveries of still earlier scientists , then he is a scientist , too , in the same sense as they . Considerations of social prestige enter into these distinctions and give feeling-tone to judgments such as Fry passed upon Sargent , but they are irrelevant to the analysis of technology . The distinctions exist independently of the invidiousness which has been associated with them . But they are not distinctions between skill and non-skill . What they distinguish is types of skill . The word " technique " is generally employed by musicians and other artists to refer to the finger-dexterity of the instrumentalist or the handand-brush dexterity with which the painter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more or less indispensable part of the equipment of every artist ; but it is often mentioned sneeringly , and for this reason . A player may have acquired great finger-dexterity and still be musically illiterate . Nearly all the great composers were at one time eminent performers , but most of them let their " techniques " run down as they became increasingly absorbed // in composition . Does this mean that playing the piano is a matter of skill but that composing music is not ? By no means . At another level of generalization it is customary to speak of " the techniques of the composer , " meaning such things as skill in using scores . Many a musician who has acquired great skill in reading music , that is , in thinking from printed notes to sounds , would experience the greatest difficulty in writing out the notes even of a quite simple tune which he had just heard for the first time . Mozart 's celebrated feat of writing out in full an unpublished and closely guarded " Miserere " after hearing it once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sheer genius " ; it was a technical achievement which was possible at all only because even at the age of fourteen Mozart was master of the techniques of the composer . He was indeed " very good at it " ; but what he was good at must not be overlooked . The conclusion toward which all these reflections lead is that all acts of skill involve the use of tools of one sort or another . Such distinctions as we have been considering are made in terms of the differences between these tools . An artisan is not a person of inferior dexterity . He is a person whose tools , however dextrously they may be used , are commonplace . But the skills of scientists and artists ? even pure scientists and creative artists ? are no less contingent on the use of tools . A mathematician or a composer may " have an inspiration " when he is wandering in the woods or ( as in the case of Henri Poincare ) when he is catching a train . At the moment he has in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his profession . Nevertheless his profession is a tool-using profession , and his " inspiration " could never have occurred to a man who had never used those tools . In the case of the composer they are such things as the diatonic scale , musical notation , existing instruments , and the like ; but even more important to the particular inspiration of the individual composer is the literature of // music : the works of other composers existing as physical objects in the form of printed scores over which he has pored most of his life . The same is true of the mathematician . At any given moment he may be without paper and pencil and not need them . But mathematics as a science could not have come into existence in the absence of paper and pencils ( or any substitutes ) . Teachers of mathematics try from the beginning to impress upon their pupils that a " point " is not a chalk-mark on a blackboard . ( In Mr. Fortune 's Maggot Sylvia Townsend Warner has written a very amusing account of the efforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aborigine . ) Mathematicians have been able to define a point as " that which has " neither length nor breadth nor thickness , whatever " that which has " may mean in such a formula ; but they could never have done so without using physical objects as tools . More important for present-day mathematics are of course the symbols which have been devised as the notation of complex mathematical operations . Here also the symbols are not themselves the operations ; but here also it is still true that the operations could not be conducted without symbols , and that no one could learn to think mathematically without having spent years poring over the printed record of the symbolically denoted operations of earlier mathematicians . The current issues of the mathematical journals are perhaps the most important tools of the trade of the practicing mathematician , and they are physical objects which must be used with skill , no less than wrenches and hammers . This absolute mutual contingency of skills and tools is of supreme importance for an understanding of technology as a function of human behavior for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be identified in no other way than by its uniform , unvarying association with tools . In some cases identification is easy . When a primitive community is fashioning a dugout canoe , we observe that two sorts // of activity are going on . While a number of men are engaged in hollowing out the log , one rattles sharks ' teeth , and roars what are obviously incantations . We identify the former as technological activity and the latter as something else . But the distinction is not so apparent to the tribesmen , since they recognize all these practitioners as members of the same " holy order " of canoe-builders and know that all are following the sacred liturgy of their order , the " workers " no less than the roarer . To us hollowing out logs is a secular activity , but " intoning " is something else ; and we apply our own distinctions as an a priori classification to the other people . Other cases are not so easy . We recognize astrology and alchemy as pre-sciences ; but the whole activity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we have learned to our sorrow , certain ways of thinking have been carried over from the earlier activity into what we have regarded as the age of reason , so that our own science at least in its early stages has been contaminated by foreign elements . How are these to be distinguished ? Categories such as " truth " and " knowledge " are disconcertingly inconclusive . It is precisely the " knowledge " of early modern times that is most dubious . The only reliable distinction is provided by what we call " experimental techniques , " that is to say the tools of science . Even the necromancers employed " laboratory " techniques and were scientists insofar as they did so , in spite of the romantic names they gave their instruments and operations . The case of the fine arts is even more confusing . Like science , all the arts were originally sacerdotal . All design and pictorial representation was at first cabalistic ; all rhythm and tone patterns , all the gestures and postures of dance and drama , were at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have left no doubt on this score . And in this case we have emerged from the savage // state only very incompletely . The arts are still associated with ecclesiastical activities and their contemplation and creation are still generally regarded as " spiritual " experiences in a sense that is not true even of science . The effect of works of art is still generally conceived to be a sort of " seizure , " and the creation of " masterworks " is still attributed to " inspiration " of a sort that is not vouchsafed to even the greatest of scientists . People repeat Wagner 's hyperbole about " God and Beethoven " as though it were a literal transfiguration ? and all this in spite of the constant insistence of practicing artists that their achievements are the result of " taking pains . " In this case also there is only one solution to the enigma : that provided by technical analysis . Popular reputations wax and wane . The " seizures " people feel in the presence of great " masterworks " are of the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by such things as " the marvelous colors , " although the actual pigments may have been renewed half-a-dozen times by quite mediocre and anonymous restorers . To the annoyance of musicians the enthusiastic public admires Mozart for his " quaintness " and Bach for the intricacy of his counterpoint , although what they call Mozart 's quaintness was a characteristic of all eighteenth-century music , while Bach 's great distinction was that he added to the contrapuntal intricacies of his day a harmonic richness which music had never known before . The achievements of the great creative artists are genuine achievements , but they are technical achievements which can be understood and genuinely appreciated only by a certain amount of study , a certain amount of knowledge of what is actually , technically going on . This understanding and appreciation is understanding of the tools ? color and design , tonal structure and texture , and the like ? with which artists actually work . In the tangled web of human life , technical activities are almost inextricably blended with // activities of another sort . The enthusiasm which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool-using activities have something in common which can be understood by virtue of the tools . It is the peculiar character of all technology , from chipped flints to Boulder Dam and Beethoven 's quartets , that it is progressive . It is inherently developmental . This circumstance which gives technology its peculiar importance in the analysis of culture ? and most of all for economists ? also can be understood only in terms of tools . If we limit the conception of technology to " skill , " we are at once subject to great risk of conceiving technological development as the growth of skills ; and since skill is a " faculty " of " individuals , " we are pre-conditioned to think of the growth of skill as in some sense an increase of this faculty on the party of individuals . But we know nothing of any such increase . That is what makes it so hard for economists of the traditional way of thinking to understand the technological principle . They understand the crucial importance of the issue . Since Veblen first began to write , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being made for technology as a master-principle of economic analysis . This claim was seen to rest on the peculiarly dynamic character of technology as itself inherently progressive and the agent of social change , in particular the agent of industrial revolution . As one of the most thoughtful of contemporary economists has remarked , this whole way of thinking " assumes for technology some kind of inner law of progress of an absolute and inscrutable character , " as well as " some equally absolute and inscrutable type of causality ' by which technology drags behind it and determines ' other phases of social change . " 1 The whole issue between old and new ways of thinking in economics comes to focus here . The new way of thinking Footnote // does indeed rest on some kind of inner law of progress . But there is nothing absolute or inscrutable about it . What makes it seem inscrutable is the inveterate predisposition of orthodox economists to think in terms of a conception of human nature as that of the uniquely individual " spirit . " Thinking so , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and thinking so , they find the principle of technological development quite inscrutable ? as indeed they must . For the developmental character of technology is implicit not in the skill-faculty of the human individual but in character of tools . The whole analysis must proceed on the level of generalization of culture rather than of individuality in order for the principle of technological progress to be understood at all . On that level it is perfectly obvious . As a result of the rapid advance of machine technology in recent years , the process of invention has attracted general attention and has become the subject of a considerable literature . ' These studies have given the coup de grace to the " heroic " theory of invention ? the myth which attributes inventions to the sheer magnitude of soul of the " Gifted Ones . " It is now generally agreed that all inventions are combinations of previously existing devices . Thus the airplane is a combination of a kite and an internal combustion engine . An automobile is a combination of a buggy with an internal combustion engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steam engine with a gaseous fuel which is substituted for the steam and exploded by the further combination of the electric spark . This is speaking broadly , of course . In actual practice the combinations are for the most part much more detailed . What is presented to the public as a " new " invention is usually itself the end product of a long series of inventions . Footnote // In this process , materials ? what economists have so misleadingly designated as " natural " resources ? function as devices . According to the principle of indestructibility of matter there is no such thing as a " new " material . Helium gas must have been present in the earth of the Texas panhandle geologic ages before man first invaded the Western hemisphere some thousands of years ago . Nevertheless helium was not a " natural resource " of the republic of Texas , inasmuch as helium was not identified in the sun for many years after the end of the republic , nor isolated from the earth 's atmosphere for many years after that , nor discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , nor treated as a resource until it was used in balloons only a few years ago . The history of every material is the same . It is one of novel combination of existing devices and materials in such a fashion as to constitute a new device or a new material or both . This is what it means to say that natural resources are defined by the prevailing technology , a practice which is now becoming quite general among economists to the further confusion of old ways of thinking ( since it involves a complete revision of the concept of " scarcity " which must now be regarded as also defined by technology and not by " nature " ) . Furthermore , as regards the nature of the process there is no difference between " mechanical " invention and " scientific " discovery . Scientific discoveries also result from the combination of previously existing devices and materials , laboratory instruments and techniques . It was by combining a magnet with a Crookes tube , for example , that J. J. Thomson discovered that the stream of incandescence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles and was even able to calculate the mass of the electrons . It was by combining a prism with a telescope that astronomers were able to identify elements ( such as helium ) in the sun . Even in the fine arts " creation " comes about in the same way . Leonardo 's // great achievement illustrated by the famous Mona Lisa , about which so much nonsense has been talked , ' was that he applied techniques which the monks had devised for the portrayal of angels to the portraiture of living subjects . Cezanne characterized his achievement as resulting from the application of Pissarro 's studio technique to painting from nature . In every innovation analysis reveals the combination of previously existing devices . That is what the achievement is which in different fields we call invention or discovery or creation . This principle of combination is important by virtue of the light it throws on previous obscurities . One of these is the role of chance in discovery and invention . An extraordinary number of the most significant discoveries have been made by chance . Columbus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indies . The discovery of the X-ray resulted from the exposure of sealed photographic plates by their accidental juxtaposition to a Crookes tube . Ehrlich 's " magic bullet " treatment for syphilis eventuated from the accidental relation between the spirochete of that disease and the trypanosome which Ehrlich had much earlier selected for experimental purposes because it was easily identified under the microscope and could be bred in laboratory animals . In the case of mechanical inventions the role of chance is even more notorious . Adam Smith relates the tale of the invention of the automatic valves by which the steam engine operates from the trick of a lazy boy who tied the control string to a moving part which then opened and closed the valve automatically . But what do we mean by " chance " or " accident " ? These words are of course relational . In a sense nothing occurs by chance , but some events are less relevant than others to any given point of reference . In all these cases the point of Footnote // reference is the previous activities of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reference to the intentions of Columbus ; but it was not accidental that it should have occurred in 1492 . The arts of shipbuilding , seamanship , and navigation being what they were by the end of the fifteenth century , somebody was " bound " to have " discovered America " within a decade or so ; and this also is true of inventions and discoveries generally . The lore of science and mechanics is full of simultaneous discoveries , often by several agents and as a result of strikingly similar combinations . The simultaneous development of the infinitesimal calculus out of the same mathematical material by Newton and Leibnitz is a case in point . So is the simultaneous enunciation of the theory of biological evolution by Darwin and Wallace . In this case the identity of the materials which entered into combination and the extreme separation of the agents of discovery are equally striking . Although Darwin thought out his statement in England and Wallace in Malaysia on the opposite side of the world , both were practicing naturalists concerned with the problem of species , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malthus ' Essay on the Principle of Population . Instances could be multiplied indefinitely . The Patent Office is engaged in a perpetual struggle with the problem of simultaneity . But what seems utterly mysterious so long as invention is regarded as an act of individual inspiration is easily explained in terms of the principle of combination . These combinations are physical not less than ideational . To be sure they are achieved by men , usually by men of great ability . But the things they put together are physical objects . The coexistence of these objects constitutes a possibility of combination which transcends the acts of any individual . It is in this sense that inventions seem " bound " to occur . Granted a working steam engine , the steam-propelled // locomotive was bound to follow . Granted the much lighter internal combustion engine , its application to the buggy and the kite was bound to result ? almost simultaneously ? in the automobile and the airplane . It is no disparagement of genius to recognize that certain combinations would almost necessarily have occurred in somebody 's hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessor in the front rank of pioneers ; it also determines when a discovery is made . Often this happens " before its time . " That is , some inspired Mendel works out a given combination , the laws of inheritance among sweet peas , years before other combinations have occurred in the field of cytology to which those laws are supremely relevant . The over-all determinant which defines the universe of discourse within which genius is at play is an objective actuality ? the tool pattern . Another anomaly of the inventive process which also is resolved by the tool-combination principle is the extraordinary role of tyros and amateurs in science and mechanics and even the fine arts . The number of important discoveries and inventions which have been made by juveniles and by such people as lawyers and clergymen whose professional training is wholly unrelated to the field in question is strikingly large ? too large to be attributed to the peculiar talents of the individuals concerned , who in many cases have done little or nothing else to attract attention . In mathematical physics , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of such extreme youth as to give rise to the saying that in this field a man has passed his peak by twenty-eight . Why is this ? Doubtless precocity has something to do with it in certain cases . Children learn languages easily , including the special languages of mathematics and music ; but it is notorious that most prodigies peter out , and in any case the prodigy theory does not explain the discoveries of the clergyman , Joseph Priestley , or the paintings of the stockbroker , Paul Gauguin. // The explanation which follows directly from the toolcombination analysis of invention is the one which accounts for the annoying facility with which an intruder often finds a solution almost instantaneously for a jigsaw puzzle with which the player has been struggling for hours . Where the solution is a matter of putting together existing pieces , it may be impeded by fixed ideas , preoccupations , and other behavior " sets , " on the part of the regular player from which the intruder is free . Consequently he sees at once the possible combination which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Innovations are often made by people who are so innocent as not to realize how outrageously novel they are . It is even said that important scientific discoveries have been made as a direct result of ignorance on the part of a discoverer who simply did not " know " that the thing he did " could not be done , " and so just went ahead and did it . This is the explanation of the importance of detachment for scientific research and other creative achievement , what Veblen called " idle " curiosity . Obviously ( though it has not been obvious to hostile critics , perhaps because they lacked detachment ) he meant " detached " and not " indolent . " Excessive preoccupation of any kind ? pious , financial , uxorious , or even professional ? is inimical to the " free play " of the imagination in the course of which combinations somehow occur . Discoveries are not made by punching timeclocks , and closing laboratories and libraries on Sunday is an excellent way to inhibit creative activity . These corollaries of the analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which Mr. Gilfillan and his colleagues are interested for their own sake , assume increasingly great theoretical importance as they proceed from the particular to the general . If technological development results from the combination of existing tool-material devices , and if such combinations follow the pattern of exist118 THE THEORY OF ECONOMIC PROGRESS ing devices and often do so in the hands of people whose peculiar advantage it is to be free from inhibiting preoccupations , then it would also seem to follow that innovations are likely to occur at any time and in any region in which devices are brought together which have hitherto existed in separate regions . This is an observed fact . The diffusion of culture traits from one culture area to another is quite generally accompanied by innovation . Indeed , so striking is the stimulus which results from culture contacts that it has been called the " cross-fertilization " of cultures . But it is the tools themselves , not the people , that have been hybridized . Such innovations ? and they include some of the most important technological advances in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special excitation of the imaginations of the people among whom they occur . As a matter of fact the people most directly concerned are usually quite unaware of the importance of what is going on ; and furthermore , once the mutually conditioning devices have been brought together , no sublime inspiration is necessary to the recognition of the pattern . The combination occurs almost " of itself , " often quite anonymously . That is one reason why the history of mechanical inventions is so difficult to trace . No one has bothered to record the event because no one is aware that an act of " heroism " has been committed . It remains for later historians gradually to become aware of the transcendent importance of these almost surreptitious developments . Regarding them , as it is their habit to regard all history , as the sum of the acts of individual men , they are at a loss for an adequate explanation . But on the cultural level of generalization , regarded as combinations of physically existing devices , these innovations are not only explicable but inevitable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a direct result of the physical embodiment of technical behavior patterns in tools and physical materials . Footnote // We have here the explanation of the " inscrutable " propensity of all technological devices to proliferate . This " propensity " is a characteristic not of men but of tools . Granted that tools are always tools of men who have the capacity to use tools and therefore the capacity to use them together , combinations are bound to occur . Furthermore it follows that the more tools there are , the greater is the number of potential combinations . If we knew nothing of history but had somehow come to understand the nature of our tools , we could infer that technological development must have been an accelerating process , almost imperceptibly slow in its earlier stages and vertiginously fast in its most recent phase . This is , of course , the observed fact . Mr. H. G. Wells , with his gift for dramatizing history , has remarked that the entire development of civilization ( as distinguished from " savagery " ) has occurred within roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one one-hundredth part of the experience of the race . The machine age occupies not more than one-tenth part of this period ; the mass-production age , one one-hundredth . The old stone age was of prodigious length ; the new stone age much shorter but still many times longer than the whole of subsequent history . Archeologists and historians are well aware of this fact . Indeed , it is one of their persistent puzzles . But it is a puzzle to which the analysis of mechanical invention now provides a key . The tool itself is the key to the great mystery . For the tool-combination principle is indeed a law of progress . If we suppose that tool-combinations occur in the same fashion as that in which digits are combined in the mathematical theory of permutations , then the resulting series is a progressive one in the mathematical sense of a series each member of which is derived from each preceding member by the same operation . In such a case it would be sharply progressive in the sense that the number of com120 THE THEORY OF ECONOMIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squares : x ; x2 ; ( x2 ) 2 ; ( ( x2 ) 2 ) 2. . . or x ; x2 ; x4 ; x8 ; x18 ... . Obviously this supposition at once calls for a number of reservations . We do not know that tool-combinations occur according to the mathematical law of permutations . Indeed we have no way of knowing for any given set of tools , devices , or materials , how many combinations are possible . We know only the ones that actually occur , and even these present a problem of enumeration which is perhaps insoluble , as is the initial enumeration of the given set . The mathematical analogy also takes no account of time , although time is of the essence of an actual historical sequence . Does the completion of each stage of the progressive series represent a year or a thousand years ? Does the time-span increase for successive stages as the magnitude of the sets increases ? Clearly the mathematical representation of the actual process of technological combination can be nothing more than illustrative , and illustrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing magnitude . Nevertheless the analogy is highly suggestive . Although no one supposes that history conforms to any simple mathematical series , the idea that the actual technological process is progressive and accelerating has occurred to a number of students in widely separated fields of investigation . ' This Footnote // principle is not teleological , any more than the physical principles of gravitation or centrifugence . It need not be supposed that any given invention is " bound " to occur . Certainly it will not occur if the solar system is obliterated by the collision of the sun with a wandering comet , nor will it occur if the human species is suddenly and completely obliterated by disease . It will not occur at any given time in any given community if all technological development , or even that particular strain of technological developments , is inhibited by contrary forces at work in that community at that time . No one supposes that the technological process is the whole of culture , any more than anyone supposes that centrifugence is the only physical force to which inhabitants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , all students of technology have recognized that it is but one aspect of culture and that culture exhibits another aspect which is inhibitory to the technological process just as gravitation inhibits centrifugence . ' In some communities , apparently , technological progress has been totally arrested . Stone-age culture is still extant in certain regions . There is no community whose history does not reveal periods in which technology has been virtually stationary for long periods of time . But these facts do not deny the existence of technology nor invalidate the analysis of technological development in terms of a continuous , cumulative , progressive process , any more than the fact that we do not fly off at a tangent to the earth 's surface invalidates the principle of centrifugence . It means that other forces also are at work , not that technological progress is an illusion . Granting all this , some students of the social sciences hesi122 THE THEORY OF ECONOMIC PROGRESS tate to identify technological development with progress for another reason . The concept of progress is in bad odor at the present time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been conceived in terms of the prevailing transcendentalism as movement toward a preconceived " end " or consummatory state . This consummatory state , as we now realize , has always been a projection , or " collective representation , " of prevailing culture . That is , every people has conceived " heaven , " or perfection , as the pure essence of its own prevailing institutions or mores , just as Dante pictured Paradise and Purgatory in terms of his own ( community engendered ) preferences and prejudices . We know today ? it is a groundprinciple of modern social science ? that such conceptions have no general validity , and students of the social sciences are therefore chary of any assumption which embodies them . But when they insist that any conception of progress " must " be transcendental , they go beyond scientific caution . Why " must " it ? What does " must " mean in this connection ? It can not mean that no other conception is possible , since another actually exists . It has been employed in mathematics since ancient times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , then , should its employment in the analysis of technology arouse resistance ? But social progress , we are told , " must " be movement toward a preconceived " end . " Why " must " it ? There is only one answer to this question . Although modern social studies have convinced us that human behavior exhibits no such " end " and therefore no such movement , we are still sufficiently obsessed by traditional ways of thinking to retain the conviction that if we are to think about social progress at all , we must do so in terms of transcendental " ends . " We " must " because that is the traditional way of thinking . This sense of intellectual compulsion to follow traditional ways of thinking is bound up with our whole conception of value , and our emancipation will certainly not be complete // until it has included that category. ? But the analysis of technological process by students of mechanical invention and of the history of science and the arts is already sufficient to indicate the existence in all culture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself and of its own character innovational , one in which change is continuous and cumulative and always in the same direction , that of more numerous and more complex technological devices . It may be objected that the very word " direction " implies an " end , " but this is not so . Direction is implicit in the nature of a series . The series of cardinal numbers is directional , since the numbers continually grow larger as we count . It would be ridiculous to say that in counting we are striving to approximate infinity , or that counting is meaningless except as infinity is preconceived to be its " end , " and it is just as ridiculous to insist that no continuous process can be conceived in the realm of culture except in terms of a preconceived " end . " Indeed , the restoration of the concept of progress is one of the crying needs of contemporary social science . The truth is , our agnosticism has gone too far . In ridding our minds of the naive collective representations of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligibility of any sort of pattern in cultural development . But the development of culture exhibits pattern . The successive layers of artifacts which are laid bare by the digging of the archeologists are not a sheer hodge-podge conglomeration . Each successive layer is somehow related to the ones below and the ones above , and the relationship exhibits some sort of continuous process . Whatever the function be called which differentiates one from another , it is a continuous function and still further differentiates the second layer above from the second layer below . To economists this problem of pattern is presented in the form of industrialization . It is a real problem . Something or Footnote // other has been going on continuously . Whether good or bad , purgatorial or paradise-approximating , it is the same process in each generation . What is this process ? For reasons which have already been discussed , traditional economic thinking has attributed this continuous development to the agency of business enterprise , and this attribution has been one of the basic postulates of that way of thinking . But its technological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is now strongly substantiated by all the studies which have contributed to our present understanding of the technological process . Students of economics are therefore confronted by a challenge . In spite of traditional assumptions , the origin and development of the industrial economy remains a mystery . Can the technological principle of explanation resolve this mystery ? It is to this challenge that we must now address ourselves . Chapter VII INDUSTRIAL EVOLUTION IN THE PRESENT state of historical knowledge , any solution of the enigma of industrial society must be largely conjectural . This means that it must be subject to revision , perhaps total revision , as our knowledge is extended by further historical research . It does not mean that one conjecture is no better than another . That it rested on a sandy foundation of " conjectural history " was one of Veblen 's favorite jibes at the classical tradition , and in this case as in so many others the criticism is implied but not developed . The same is true of the jibe at the " taxonomy " of orthodox price theory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad a priori about classification . The point is that the word " taxonomy " has been most extensively used by botanists among whom it is understood to refer particularly to the taxonomic exercises of Linnaeus and his predecessors whose classification of the plants has had to be almost totally revised in the light of modern knowledge of the morphology and physiology of plants because it was based on external observations of gross structures . Veblen made his meaning clear to the perspicacious reader by other jibes of an even more explicitly botanical and Linnaean character , but these also have been 125 // shrugged off as mere epithets . In the case of " conjectural history , " the fault , obviously , was not with the fact that the historical reconstructions of the classical economists were conjectural . With his conjectures on the " savage " and " barbarous " stages of culture and on the role of the " dolichoblond " in history ? bad guesses , based on nineteenth-century anthropology , by which sympathetic students have been embarrassed ever since ? Veblen was least qualified to object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real basis of his jibe at the " conjectural history " with which classical political economy was buttressed was not that it was guesswork but that it was bad guesswork , based not on historical knowledge however fragmentary but on assumptions with regard to the price system , the role of capital , and the order of nature including human nature , for which a historical background was invented ad hoc . Or rather it was a legend dressed up in scientific language ? a tribal myth , glorifying the ancestors , and on that account , perhaps , surviving undetected into the Age of Reason . We are still unable to state as a matter of scientifically demonstrated fact just what the forces were which resulted in the appearance of an industrial economy , first in western Europe and then in America and so throughout the world . In the field of history , indeed , scientific demonstration is extremely limited and consists largely in establishing the authenticity of contemporary records , reducing the discrepancies among them with regard to dates , names , and to a still more limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . This is why historians declare that it is not their business as scientists to assign causes to any social developments nor even perhaps to characterize such developments . Nevertheless it is with regard to social developments , their nature and causes , that we seek enlightenment ; and if we can obtain answers to our insistent questions only by conjecture , then with conjecture we are obliged to deal . // Even so , our conjectures need not be wholly uninformed . Though certain historical knowledge is still extremely limited , it is vastly ampler today than two centuries ago . This is notably the case in the field of economic history . More work has been done in this field during the past generation than resulted from all previous efforts put together , in part certainly because of general dissatisfaction with the conjectures of the past ; and with surprising unanimity modern researches testify to the extraordinary magnitude of the industrial revolution . History , it seems , has a way of disconcerting social dogmas . When Arnold Toynbee first popularized the phrase " industrial revolution , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to academic classes but to audiences of workingmen . More orthodox economists have done their best to qualify the importance of industry as a prime-mover in economic change by limiting the industrial revolution to a brief moment between a supposed " commercial " revolution and a conjectural later stage of " finance capitalism " ; but more and more research exhibits more and more convincing evidence of an industrial process identical and continuous with that described by Toynbee and extending at least throughout modern times . This body of fact is something with which any conjectural reconstruction must now reckon . Another has resulted from the labors of the medievalists . The civilization of medieval Europe used to be described as static . The institutions of feudal society were thought to have crystallized into a stable , not to say rigid , structure ; and the medieval mind was conceived to have been fixed in a groove of dogma , utterly subservient to the pronouncements of Aristotle and the doctrines of the Church . This was the view of the humanists who were engaged by the end of the fifteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a view which later generations , sympathizing with this effort , have therefore perpetuated . But // it is a view which we now know to have been false . ' Why , after all , were those shackles so easily cast off ? Apparently they were not so strong as was supposed in early modern times . Even chronology betrays the conventional belief . This epoch during which for so long a time European society was thought to be stable was briefer than the occupancy of North America by European peoples ; and during this brief period tremendous changes occurred . Most important of all , this age in which European society was so fully " integrated " and " self-realized " was immediately followed by the greatest convulsion in the whole of history , a strange outcome for a period of such complete stability . The truth is ? and it is a scientifically demonstrated fact if there is any such thing anywhere in the field of history ? the middle age was a period of ferment , pregnant with imminent and fundamental change ; in short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much better known at present than it was in Veblen 's day . Not only is the continuity of the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean region much more fully known today than half a century ago , primitive culture also is far better understood , including the continuity of ancient civilization with neolithic culture . What Veblen saw , through all the imperfections of the anthropology of his youth , that modern civilization is necessarily continuous with that of primitive man and is not understood until that continuity has been appreciated , is now far more completely substantiated than it was in the nineteenth century . To a far greater extent than ever before , anthropological studies enable us to see why and how later civilization is conditioned by earlier civilization , how the industrial revolution itself extends back to include even primeval man . Indeed , the mystery of industrial revolution resolves itself Footnote // into three related enigmas which must all be solved together or not at all . The first and most immediate is the question , why did the industrial revolution occur in western Europe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ancient Greece ? What forces were operative in the modern European situation which were not operative elsewhere and at other times ? Granted that inventions occurred which altered the material framework of society , why did they so occur ? This first question ? for it is a single question ? assumes another . It assumes that something or other was going on in western Europe , or perhaps the world , by virtue of which pre-industrial European society was the matrix of industrial revolution . What was this ? To external appearance the civilization of medieval Europe was not utterly unlike those of China or of the ancient world ; nevertheless it must have been effectively different in some respect directly related to the later burgeoning of industrial revolution . What was this difference ? In what way was pre-industrial European society endowed with the capacity of parenthood of industrialism ? Behind these questions there lies still another . In our speculation concerning other possible routes of industrialization we raise the question of China or ancient Greece . Why not the Dyak culture of central Borneo , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andaman islanders ? Apparently the parent civilization from which industrial society later sprang was itself of a very special character , one of but few in the history of civilization . What was this character , and how was it related to the development of that condition which we have called the " parenthood " of industrialism ? When and why and how did the first cleavage occur in the development of culture of which industrial society was the end product ? Whether these questions can ever be answered with scientific certainty , our reflections concerning them are greatly assisted by the knowledge which modern researches have // afforded , and this is true with regard to each of the three . If we proceed chronologically and deal first with the one which goes farthest back , we find that the anthropologists have a technological answer to the question why a certain type of civilization should have appeared in certain areas which was capable of becoming the matrix of later industrial developments as other cultures were not . It must not be assumed that there is any manifest destiny by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assumption would run afoul of the drift fence which anthropologists have set up to guard against just such teleological ways of thinking . There is no one line of cultural evolution along which all peoples are moving . We must not and need not assume that life in settled communities is " natural " to man . It would be just as reasonable to make a contrary assumption on the basis of the persistence with which men in settled communities seek to " return to nature " when opportunity affords . Rather it was a specific event in the lives of certain peoples which had this result for better or worse . This event was the discovery or invention of agriculture . Even here we must not assume too much . As Thurnwald has pointed out , ' there is an indefinite number of different kinds of agriculture and agricultural communities . It was the discovery of wheat , twelve to fifteen thousand years ago , and the development of the practice of cultivating cereal food which had the significant effect of stabilizing settled communities . The effect was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense . It has been remarked that agricultural peoples seem quite commonly to develop characteristic superstitions and magic rites based on the reproductive cycle of the grains on which they are so dependent , and that these seem to produce theocratic social systems of a singularly onerous kind . But it can hardly Footnote // be supposed that these practices formed the basis of the later developments which we seek to trace . Nor should it be supposed that the practice of agriculture stimulates the technological " faculty . " What it does lead to is the accumulation of technical materials . When people stay put in any particular locality things accumulate , and the accumulation of the physical instruments and materials of living constitutes a forcing bed of technological development . No doubt this tendency is at work everywhere . But there are certain regions in which the configuration of the earth has made continued occupancy possible over very long periods of time with correspondingly formidable technological development . It has long been apparent that certain areas have been the scene of such developments : the Nile and Mesopotamian valleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huang-Ho valleys ; and the valleys of Central America and the Andes . In other regions agricultural occupancy has been more intermittent and more limited ; in still others , virtually nonexistent . Thus the European plain was not the scene of development of any " great " ( i.e. , continuous and extensive ) civilization contemporaneously with these other regions , although it is one of the most fertile areas on earth , probably because it was not protected by natural barriers of mountain and desert and jungle as the others were . It is not that the geographical character of the " cradles of civilization " in any positive sense " determined " the cultural developments which took place there . Certainly it need not be supposed that neolithic man , foreseeing the future over thousands of years , cannily selected the regions in which great civilizations might materialize . Rather the geographical configuration of the different localities acted as a limiting factor . In some regions , like the European plain , exposure inhibited development ; in others the unearned increment of natural barriers permitted development to occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? was a long-continued accumulation of technical contrivances and materials with the development , inevitable under such circumstances , of the progressive series of techniques which we call civilization . This development was of course continuous with the technical achievements of primeval man , upon which the discovery of agriculture itself was posited . In this sense the industrial revolution is continuous and goes back to the coup de going , not to mention the techniques of using fire , the domestication of animals , and all the rest . But however continuous , the emergence of the industrial economy has not been without event ; and perhaps the first great cleavage by virtue of which the possibility of later development was narrowed down to not more than four great culture areas was the one here under discussion ; and if so it is significant that this first cleavage has already been interpreted in technological terms . The next problem is that of the circumstances which further narrowed the field not only to one of these four areas but to a particular region within the general field of Mediterranean civilization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture-history of western Europe that is unique ? This region was the residuary legatee of thousands of years of civilization in the Mediterranean area , but so were many others . The Nile and Mesopotamian valleys are still inhabited . Wherein does western Europe differ from them ? When the question is put in terms of these alternatives part of the answer is obvious at once . Of all the regions in which Mediterranean civilization flourished in ancient times , Egypt and Mesopotamia are the oldest and western Europe the youngest . Indeed the difference in age is so great ? running to thousands of years , or several times the age of the younger member ? as to demand consideration . But although the solution to the problem may be a function of age , it is not a mere matter of chronology . // Western Europe was in the most literal sense the frontier region of Mediterranean civilization . This has been seen most clearly , perhaps , by the great Belgian historian , Henri Pirenne.3 A frontier is a penetration phenomenon . It is a region into which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing with them the tools and materials of their older life , their cereal and their architectural designs and all the rest . They also bring their immemorial beliefs and " values , " their mores and folkways . But it is notorious that the latter invariably suffer some reduction in importance under the conditions of frontier life . Existence on the frontier is , as we say , free and easy . Meticulous observance of the Sabbath and the rules of grammar are somehow less important on the frontier than " back home . " While this is true of all frontiers , the difference is greatly accentuated by the presence of a considerable population , indigenous to the region , to whom the whole culture-system of the invaders is more or less completely foreign . The discrepancy between the civilization of Caesar 's Rome and that of pre-Roman Gaul was not as great as that between Winthrop 's England and pre-British Massachusetts , and perhaps as a consequence the Franks were assimilated whereas the North American Indians were not . But we must guard against supposing that Frankish assimilation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient civilization as " their " civilization at an earlier stage ; but this is true only with great reservations . Neither " Hellenism " nor " Hebraism " was indigenous to western Europe . Both were foreign importations , doubtfully assimilated by the " natives " for many centuries . For example , throughout the " dark " ages of western Europe when literacy was extremely rare and the Footnote // ancient classics were almost unknown , the education of upper-class children of Byzantine civilization included memorizing the Iliad and the Odyssey . Modern educators may rejoice in this " emancipation , " and as we shall see there may be good grounds , at least from the point of view of industrial revolution , for general rejoicing . The point is that western Europe was a frontier in which ancient culture was only partially installed . The importance of this reservation is even further emphasized if we consider it in terms of the religion of the Western peoples . Ever since the Crusades the Western nations have considered themselves the defenders of the faith until it has been forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cultural elements which have been blended in Christian theology ? the original Hebraism , the trinitarian syncretism and neo-Platonic mysticism of Egypt , Indo-Persian Mithraism , and all the rest ? none originated in western Europe . Furthermore the conversion of some of the Western peoples to Christianity was so tardy and the persistence of pagan elements , such as the spring fertility rites of the May-pole and the Gothic cult of the tannenbaum , was so strong that the church continued to be greatly exercised over the residue of paganism in its midst until quite recently . This , it is now established , is the reason for the singular asperity , continuing even in the American colonies , . of the measures taken against witchcraft . In addition it must be recalled that Mohammedanism was securely established in Europe itself , just across the Pyrenees , throughout the middle ages ; and that it was much more a world religion and a vehicle of culture than Christianity . To recall these facts is not to question the importance of Christianity in the history of the Western peoples . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unifying element in feudal society , and justly so . But for this unifying element the Western peoples might not have achieved // any sort of cultural unity . But our concern is with industrial evolution , and from this point of view the church must be recognized as the spearhead of institutional resistance to technological change. ? Under the leadership of the church , feudal society opposed and interdicted all the great innovations of which industrial society is the outgrowth ; but that opposition was ineffective ? from the point of view of industrial evolution , happily so ? and its ineffectiveness was due not to any pronounced difference of temper and intent which might be conceived to distinguish Christianity from other creeds but rather to the fact that it was after all an alien creed which bore much less heavily upon the Western peoples than did Islam upon the Arabs , Hinduism upon India , or Confucianism upon China . When we are tempted to think of the church as the quintessence of medieval civilization we should stop and ask ourselves which , after all , was the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary , the Emperor Frederick II ? This aspect of the case of European civilization comes to focus in the popular enigma of the fall of Rome , that favorite topic of moralists and debating societies . In his most famous phrase Gibbon attributed it to " the triumph of barbarism and religion " ; the French and Russian revolutions have inclined others to explain it in terms of the spread of " Bolshevism " ; and all the while the truth is that the Roman Empire did not fall . As J. B. Bury succinctly pointed out , ' the empire of which Rome had for a time been the capital persisted without a break for a thousand years after the date which Western historians have agreed to consider as its end . Throughout this time it was what it had always been , the Hellenic empire of the Mediterranean culture area . The amazing perversion of the plainest of historical evidence by Footnote // which Western historians have represented Odoacer as having brought the ancient empire to an end is a compound of two characteristically European provincialisms . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successor and inheritor of " the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome , " and the other is a historic aversion to Byzantine civilization carried ultimately to the point of refusing to credit its existence . It was western Europe that fell , not Rome . Modern historical scholarship has at last recognized this fact and so has made it possible for us to understand the two respects in which the civilization of western Europe was unique . The culture of western Europe was technologically continuous with that of the whole Mediterranean area , and it was also institutionally discontinuous . Gaul was a fully occupied Roman province for a period as long as that during which Europeans have inhabited North America , and during this time the whole technological accretion of thousands of years of ancient agricultural civilization was introduced into western Europe . At the end of this time ? the date is of course indefinite since the process was very gradual ? the tie of empire was severed . Never again was western Europe brought under the aegis of Mediterranean empire . The institutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians are now generally agreed that the severance was all but complete . The feudal system which emerged from the institutional chaos of early centuries was in large measure a native growth , and even the Christian church underwent a very substantial transmutation from the proletarian cult of early Roman days to the feudal hierarchy of the papacy . Most of the Hellenism by which later European culture has been suffused and most of the influence of Roman law upon later European jurisconsults were medieval importations , " rediscoveries " of our cultural ancestors made with the help of Byzantine codifiers and Mohammedan // philosophers . The actual experience of the European peoples was that of a frontier community endowed with a full complement of tools and materials derived from a parent culture and then almost completely severed from the institutional power system of its parent . The result was unique . It is doubtful if history affords another instance of any comparable area and population so richly endowed and so completely severed . That western Europe was the seat of a great civilization in the centuries that followed was due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever lost ; that it was of all the great civilizations of the time incomparably the youngest , the least rigid , less stifled than any other by age-long accumulations of institutional dust , more susceptible by far than any other to change and innovation , was due to that unique severance . Almost certainly it was this composite character which made the civilization of medieval Europe the parent of industrial revolution . The actual process was a true case of cross-fertilization . The fault line between medieval and modern European civilization is marked by a series of immense cultural eruptions . This fact and even its importance have always been recognized . In spite of the inhibition of their scientific methodology historians have never been able wholly to resist the temptation to rhapsodize over the series of world-shaking innovations by which the transition from medieval to modern times is punctuated . No list is definitive , and it is entirely possible that innovations of the first magnitude still escape our observation . But some are so obvious as to appear on every list . Thus no one doubts the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compass and astrolabe , of the symbol for zero , of the mill wheel and the clock . It was this series of inventions and discoveries and an indefinitely long series of lesser but related ones that set up the process of which industrial revolution was the consummation . // These master inventions and discoveries signalize a third process without which in all probabilty the industrial revolution could not have occurred . For the analysis of this process the case of printing is most serviceable for a number of reasons . No other innovation outranks printing in the importance of its effects ; in its actual history no other is better known ; and no other presents a clearer case of cultural crossfertilization . The actual invention of printing from movable types took place in one of the industrial towns of northern Europe ? perhaps Mainz , perhaps Haarlem , perhaps both and also others ? about five centuries ago . The specific device with which Gutenberg and the other contestants for the honor are credited was that of type-molds for casting metal types to be used interchangeably . Considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very simple as to constitute something of a mystery . Why should the invention of so simple an apparatus be regarded as a turning point of history ? The obvious answer to this question is in terms of its effects , and this is the one that is most commonly given . But this only multiplies the mystery . Why should such a trifling invention have had such prodigious effects ? If we say only that it made printed material available on a much larger scale than previously , we . run the risk of imputing modern habits and motives to the fifteenth century . Who wanted printing to be available on such a scale ? Should we imagine the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries to have eked out a miserable existence complaining bitterly all the while over the injustice which deferred the invention of printing to the fifteenth ? Clearly something more than availability is at issue ; and that something is related to a further mystery . If the type-mold was such a simple device ( as it was ) , why should it not have been invented very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancients cast metal ? why not types ? To be sure , the art of printing did not exist in any // form in the ancient world . It was developed in China over a period of many centuries and introduced into Europe probably in the thirteenth century ( that time which was so singularly free from cataclysmic disturbances ! ) probably by the agency of Mongol conquest e ( that military exploit which was so utterly devoid of cultural significance ) . But why did the Chinese , ingenious as they were and familiar with the arts of casting metal , nevertheless fail to invent type-molds ? It will hardly do to attribute this failure to the ancestor-worshiping stupidity of the Chinese at the very moment when we are crediting them with the development and perfection , within certain limits , of an art which all the philosophers and scientists of the Western world had failed to achieve at all . The answer , it is now generally agreed , is to be found not in Chinese character but in the Chinese language . That language , or family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insistent pressure of the industrial West , a sort of " basic " Chinese has been developed ; but classical Chinese involves the use of a vast number of distinct ideographs , a number so large as to make interchangeable types of doubtful value . Without doubt this is the reason why Chinese printers have continued to carve their texts from wooden blocks even down to the present time . In this connection it is interesting to speculate on the possible relation between the Chinese written language and the origin of printing . The problem of textual purity is peculiarly acute for the Chinese . During the Han dynasty , which was contemporaneous with the Roman emperors , an organized effort was made to establish correct readings of the then ancient classics , and these were carved on stone blocks to which ever after scholars would refer for authentic versions of disputed passages . It became customary to assure Footnote // authenticity by taking pressings , an elementary form of the practice of modern archeologists of taking photographs of every inscription . This practice was one , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and if so , the character of the Chinese language may have played a crucial part in the development of an art in China for which the West produced no counterpart . In the West , however , the character of the written language was utterly different . It is supposed that the Phoenicians may have been the first to use a phonetic alphabet , but the practice spread in very early times to all the written languages of the Mediterranean culture area . Western Europe having been colonized by the Romans , its languages were reduced to the Latin alphabet ( with Procrustean effects from which school children still suffer ) . Thus the region into which the Chinese art of printing was introduced in the thirteenth century was one in which only a small number of graphic symbols were made to serve all the needs of literature . Such being the case it was inevitable that the types for these symbols should be used interchangeably . The invention of Gutenberg was " bound " to occur sooner or later as a function not of Western inventive genius but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought together . The two centuries or so which elapsed before the invention did actually occur may be taken as an index of the apparent triviality of the Chinese art . The Western world was at this time not unliterary . It had its own methods of recording and transmitting worthy writings , methods with which ( our feelings to the contrary notwithstanding ) it felt no general dissatisfaction . Paper had been introduced into the Western world from China some time before and by a different route , and its availability to the printers of the fifteenth century is another tool-combination of vast importance ; but its importance was not felt by the scholars of the medieval world who regarded it as a distinctly inferior // material . Hence the first uses of printing were of a singularly frivolous character , not at all indicative of any felt need for the improvement of the art . The invention of printing from movable types ? whatever its consequences may have been ? was itself the result of the conjunction of the technology of duplication with that of phonetic symbolism , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an incident to Mongol conquest in the thirteenth century . But however striking , the case of printing is by no means unique . The same process is also illustrated almost as dramatically by the development of the sailing ship . Here , too , the consequences are prodigious . At one moment Europeans are no more involved in the affairs of other peoples than other peoples are in theirs . ( This , it may be noted in passing , is probably the reason for the present disposition , of people who find the modern world disturbing , to idealize the medieval world as one in which these disturbances were happily absent . It is true , for whatever it may be worth , that medieval society was more completely self-contained than European society has been since that time . ) At the next moment Europeans are circumnavigating the globe , intruding upon every continent and to a continually increasing degree meddling with the affairs of every other people . Here , too , the actual process is singularly obscure and subject to outrageous misinterpretation . Just as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of the invention as the necessary preliminary to the dissemination of economics textbooks , or the Saturday Evening Post , in that of shipbuilding we have been very much inclined to explain " the age of voyage and discovery " as the necessary preliminary to world trade , in the first instance with the Indies . Because the Turks captured Constantinople in 1453 and because Columbus is known to have cajoled Isabella with talk of the riches of the Indies half a century later , we have concluded that trade with the Indies was an economic neces142 THE THEORY OF ECONOMIC PROGRESS sity and that the Turks had interrupted it . Only recently has it been demonstrated that the Turks did no such thing . Apparently the explanation of those exploits of voyage and discovery which has been taught to several generations of school children was a sheer fabrication , a case of historical conjecture of the sort historians have learned to shun . Even more preposterous is the supposition that fifteenthcentury mariners were the first who were bold enough to sail out of sight of land , since we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of Homer and that their tales of Scylla and Charybdis represent a conspiracy in restraint of trade ; but in this case an important fact lies behind the legend . The Mediterranean is a sea to be treated with extreme circumspection not because of navigational difficulties ( we forget that even the ancients could read the stars , as our word " cynosure " ought to be a perpetual reminder ) but because it is subject to sudden and sometimes prolonged calms . Consequently a sailing vessel runs great risk . This is why sail was supplemented by oars from ancient times continuously right down to the nineteenth century and the introduction of steam power . It was this circumstance which dictated the design of Mediterranean shipbuilding . The Mediterranean Sea dictated the use of oars , and the use of oars dictated shallow draft ( except for warships which did not carry cargoes ) . The arts of shipbuilding and fitting underwent continuous development in the Mediterranean culture area from very ancient times right on down through the middle ages , with the result that the ships which plied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . But they were virtually confined to the Mediterranean not only by the short voyages which the use of oars and consequent necessity of carrying stores for a large crew necessarily imposed but by the fact that their shallow-draft design ruled them off the oceans . Such ships were unfit for voyages // exclusively under sail because for this purpose a ship must be able to sail into the wind . Mediterranean ships were unable to do this . The reason for this limitation , it has been pointed out , was not ignorance of the art of tacking but the propensity of shallow-draft ships to make leeway when sailing into the wind . On this account Mediterranean mariners were perfectly justified in their fear of venturing out upon the stormy Atlantic . Meantime , however , the Vikings were crossing the Atlantic in ships much smaller and , excellent as they were , much less sturdy than those which prevailed throughout the Mediterranean . This was possible because their ships had been evolved for use on a stormy sea and were therefore clinkerbuilt and of ( relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with standard Mediterranean equipment ; but lacking oars they developed the " steerboard , " which was quite unnecessary to the oar-propelled galleys of the Mediterranean . The ships which began to cross the oceans toward the end of the fifteenth century were a combination of these two types . We do not know exactly how or when or where combination occurred . Perhaps it was in the shipyards of the coast of the Bay of Biscay , where Viking culture flowing down met Mediterranean culture flowing up.7 Even so , a considerable time elapsed before the meeting was fruitful ; but this may serve to emphasize two points : that the combination was not deliberate and had no special " end " in view ( such as the Indies ) , and that a ship is not one simple device but rather a mass of culture traits , so that combination would almost inevitably be the slow function of a general cultural amalgamation and general technological development . But it seems to be a fairly safe conjecture that the age of voyage and discovery was a function of ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a combination of dif-ferent types of earlier devices , and that the combination occurred as a result of culture contact . Similar analysis of other notable discoveries and inven-tions of this early modern period produces similar results . The magnetic needle was introduced from China but com-bined with navigation in Europe . ' The astrolabe , forerunner of the sextant and quite as important as the compass whether or not Columbus used it in 1492 , was introduced from Islam but adapted to navigational use in Europe in 1485 . His-torians have always recognized the importance of gunpowder as an agent of social change . Some even say point-blank that gunpowder destroyed feudalism . The history of this inven-tion is more than usually obscure . It may have been an independent product of the alchemy of Roger Bacon . But since an identical substance is known to have been used many centuries earlier in China for ceremonial purposes ( and on that account perhaps never combined with the tech-niques of war ) , and since the Byzantines had developed the war-technique of pouring mixtures of sulfur , quicklime , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjecture that the Chinese ceremonial powder became gunpowder when it was combined with the Byzantine siphon , which thereupon became a cannon . Certainly the Hindu-Arabic numerals including the symbol for zero , invention of which has been called the most important innovation of the age , were introduced from Islam , presumably by Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa in 1202 . The clock has been called the master-pattern of all subsequent expedients in the field of power-driven machinery , ' but it was probably an adaptation and development of a still more elementary power transINDUSTRIAL // mission , that of the windmill and water wheel , probably introduced from Asia Minor by the crusaders . It is the analysis of cases such as these that supports a third conjecture with regard to the inception of the industrial revolution in Europe . Not only was western Europe the recipient of the technological accumulations of thousands of years of ancient agricultural civilization , the development of an independent culture on the European frontier of ancient society coincided with a period of old-world culture-contact and culture-diffusion which was equally unique . Even in ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civilizations of India and China , but these contacts were inconsequential in comparison with the eruptions of the middle ages . The rise of Islam effected contacts along the southern water route from China to Spain from which Europe obtained paper , the decimal system , a renewed acquaintance with the ancient classics , Arabian science , and how much else we can only conjecture . The Crusades have always been known to have had a secular and even economic importance probably outweighing their religious significance . But that importance can not be measured in trade . If , as seems to be the case , the windmill and water wheel were introduced into Europe by returning crusaders , the whole subsequent development of Europe was affected . The eruption of the Vikings was almost certainly responsible for the development which ushered in the age of voyage and discovery . Mongol conquest brought printing from China . These contacts multiply the importance of the frontier character of European civilization . Had they been deferred for another thousand years , those qualities of feudal society which the humanists so greatly emphasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly have prevailed to such an extent as to render Europe as impervious to contact-stimulation as were the other great civilizations of the day . For all these contacts were necessarily bilateral , or multilateral . To note the most specific and perhaps the most significant instance , Islam also had its chance to develop Chinese printing . But whereas in Europe the fulminations of divines against the heathen art were without important effect , in Islam the prohibition of any " graven image " contained in the Mosaic code which Islam shares with Christianity was taken so literally as to exclude even the Chinese style of printing from carved wooden blocks . It was this state of mind and feeling which , prevailing all along the line , inhibited the free use of " heathen " arts in each of the older civilizations and so prevented the occurrence of tool-combinations which was potential in each culture area . Modern Europeans have inclined to take great credit to themselves for not being ancestorworshipers as so many other peoples are . The truth is that the disposition to venerate the ancestors is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have the most ancestors , such as the Chinese and the Byzantines ( who , perhaps , died of it ) . It is felt least by frontiersmen : Australians , western Americans , and in their day medieval Europeans . In medieval Europe it was felt least by townsmen not because of any peculiar spiritual quality of urban residence but because the townsmen had sloughed off their ancestors . As Pirenne so graphically puts it , they were deracines , uprooted men . This is the paradox of the medieval towns : they grew up in feudal society but they were never o f it . Pirenne remarks in one of his most luminous passages that the towns were from the first a function not of local society but of world trade . " As such they were the inevitable medium of Jews and Syrians as well as European foreigners ; but in spite of this the greater part of their population was always drawn from the local countryside . They were of course de-Footnote // pendent for their living chiefly on the produce of the local countryside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the local countryside depended . In emphasizing this point in another passage Pirenne seems almost to contradict his earlier declaration.h1 But such is the nature of the paradox . The runaway serfs who populated the medieval towns ceased to be feudal serfs and became declasses , eventually a " middle " class , not a part of the feudal order at all . It is another significant case of technological continuity and institutional discontinuity . Technologically , the medieval towns were a functional part of the com-munity ; institutionally , they were distinct.12 Their closest ties were with each other and with the outside world . Hence the effect of culture contact was concentrated in the towns . There , where representatives of all the arts and crafts were closely assembled and where all the apparatus of all the trades was concentrated , new devices from the outside world were brought into close contact with all the tools of the Mediterranean tradition . Nothing could have been more favorable to combination . It has already been noted that the invention of type-molds for printing from movable types could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal worker . Such instances could be indefinitely extended . For example , the use of metal types requires a change of ink . Throughout the ages the Chinese have used a water-medium ink for printing from wood blocks ; but water will not spread evenly on metal surfaces . Little note is taken of this crisis in European civilization in the conventional histories of printing , the writers of which only remark that this circumstance led to the use of an oil-medium ink . But how did it lead ? Such a statement recalls a remark which appears in a well-known manual of European economic his-tory to the effect that the early European villagers found // the long-shared plow best adapted to breaking the tough sod . Where did they find it ? out in the woods ? The truth seems to be that other contemporary denizens of the same north-European towns , Van Eyck by name , fine artisans in paint , had invented " a new method of painting " which at first they had closely guarded , so that it was just beginning to be known in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new method " was the use of linseed oil as a medium . The use of flax reaches back to the very earliest periods of civilization , but apparently the use of the oil of the flaxseed as a medium for paint , and so for printer 's ink , began with the Van Eycks . This incident is a beautiful illustration of the technological continuity of the " fine " and the " useful " arts , and an equally clear case of the function of the medieval towns as forcing beds of technological development . For the performance of this function the towns of medieval Europe were qualified by three interrelated sets of circumstances : they were technological concentration points ; they were semidetached from the institutional structure of feudal society ; and they were in the most direct contact with the outside world where a process of hemispheric culture diffusion was going on . From this point onward the character of the industrial revolution is unmistakable . Modern European society is an outgrowth of the process which was going on in the medieval towns . It is urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the whole process is one of social change induced by technological development . Since Arnold Toynbee 's analysis of the dramatic events of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries no one has ventured to deny that the steam engine and the power loom were vehicles of social change ; but is this any less true of gunpowder and movable type ? What does one mean by saying that gunpowder destroyed feudalism ? Cannon made feudal castles obsolete ; and since cannon and their ammunition are direct products // of heavy industry , they brought the supreme coercive power of the modern state to focus in the centers of heavy industry , as it has been ever since . Furthermore the development of musketry and small arms shifted the center of gravity of a whole society by putting a weapon more lethal than the noble 's sword into the hands of the common man , one which can be used with deadly effect by persons who have not spent their entire youth mastering the art of homicide . We have forgotten what firearms meant to common citizens because we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not for nothing does the American Bill of Rights guarantee to all citizens " the right to bear arms . " Rights are governmental ; but before any such right could exist there must have been bearable arms ; that is , firearms . The case of printing is the clearest possible exemplar of industrial revolution . The invention of printing from movable type had the immediate effect of extending the art of reading and writing to the whole community . Written languages which employ phonetic symbols are relatively easy to learn , incomparably easier than the Chinese written language . Throughout the ages the only barrier to general literacy in the West was the scarcity of materials . The invention of printing made written-language materials not only cheap but very common . The output of the presses in the six decades between Gutenberg 's invention and the close of the fifteenth century has been estimated in millions . This can mean only one thing . In the course of two generations a whole community had learned to read . The importance of the invention of printing derives from this result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of literature . The spread of literacy did greatly facilitate the spread of ideas , and this may well have been one of its most important effects ; but it was by no means the whole effect . That was nothing less than the transformation of the essential // character of the community , a transformation which had its incidence upon every aspect of life . Certainly its political effects are beyond exaggeration . No doubt Mr. H. G. Wells has exaggerated the political importance of newspapers , but in doing so he has only made the newspaper the symbol of a much more general intercommunication of which democracy is perhaps the political expression ? without which , certainly , popular government is limited to units the size of the Greek city-state or the New England town meeting . Democracy is of course more than intercommunication . It involves enlightenment ; and enlightenment is more than the transmission of information . It involves subtle changes of attitude . Such changes of attitude were among the most portentous consequences of general literacy . Much has been made of the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a fact of very great importance , but its significance is quite different from what is generally supposed . To the community at large the Bible had been a mystery throughout the ages . The veneration in which it was held was due in large part to this circumstance , as the doctors of the church well understood . Its publication was opposed by the church for this reason , and rightly ? as events have amply proved . From publication it was but a step to higher criticism . The separation of church and state , which is one of the most fundamental expressions of the democratic attitude , was itself a consequence of the progressive secularization of Western civilization of which the printing press has been far and away the most important agent . It is easy to maintain sacred fictions in a community to whom every letter is an occult symbol ; in a community to whom the printed word has become a common tool , no fiction is shielded from the scrutiny of the people , not even the divinity which hedges kings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political life of the Western peoples . It is a commonplace of // economic history that business enterprise was transformed . This change has been imputed to the " spirit " of modern capitalism which in turn has been attributed by Sombart and others to an access of " rationality " on the part of early modern business men . But the business men of early modern times can hardly be supposed to have experienced an access either of cupidity or of intelligence . The only demonstrable change was one of tools . At this point as at many others ? for example , in the development of science ? language and ciphering cross-fertilized each other . Bookkeeping involves both . The invention of double-entry bookkeeping ? another great technical innovation of the time ? constituted a tremendous advance in the technology of business organization . Their mastery of this instrument of strategy and tactics gave business men an enormous advantage in the struggle for power in which they were engaged . It even provided them with the ideology of the financial power-system . The concept of capital itself is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect of the life of the community can be reduced to an entry in a ledger . The " spirit " of modern capitalism was itself a product not of printing alone but of the industrial revolution of which printing was so significant a feature . Most important of all , however , was the effect of printing upon industry . For purposes of " total war " what is called " functional literacy " has only recently been defined as " ability to read simple printed directions . " 13 This is the most important kind of literacy because it conditions the industrial effectiveness of the whole community . The most important inscriptions of modern industrial civilization are those which read , " Danger : Live Wires , " and things of similar import . That is , written language is a tool which combines with all other tools fundamentally modifying their accessibility and functioning effectiveness . The functional illiterate is ex-Footnote // eluded from the whole industrial process . He remains a vestigial peasant in an industrial community . Or , to put it the other way , literacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers . The case of printing thus illustrates the climactic characteristic of industrial revolution . It has often been remarked that the difference between industrial and pre-industrial civilization is not a matter of using mechanical devices but rather of the use of machines to make machines . Or the same thing is put in terms of invention , thus : it is not the occurrence of inventions that distinguishes modern civilization but the organization of society to bring this about . The primary instrument for such organization is literacy . If anything so subtle can be dated at all , it should be dated with reference not to the steam engine but to printing . This transformation of the community includes much more than literacy . Among other things it includes the physical framework of existence . One of the most important ? and most neglected ? aspects of the industrial revolution is the revolution in housing which took place in early modern times . Economic historians have much to say about " the domestic system " of manufacture , but with their usual pertinacity they conceive this system almost exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of physical shelter . But industrial operations require shelter , not only because the tools and materials of industry suffer by exposure to the elements but even more because the level of efficiency which even the simplest handicraft operations exact from their workers is higher than that required of peasants and can be obtained only by provision of a certain degree of shelter . The general introduction of stockings and night clothes is often cited as indicative of the changes brought by industrialization , and in this connection such things are usually treated merely as comforts or even perquisites . The sheer energy-sapping brutalization of medieval // ( and earlier ) life has now so far been forgotten that we no longer realize that perpetual chill and improper sleep are crippling . It is in this sense that the domestic revolution of early modern times made an indispensable contribution to the general industrial process . We know little about it , but we do know that three innovations in domestic architecture distinguished the houses which became the scene of " the domestic system " of manufacture : flues , glazed windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any pre-industrial community except in rudimentary forms . Each had its own industrial background of stone masonry , glass manufacture , and metalworking ; and each had its remoter cultural sources in earlier and more rudimentary devices . All were developed by the artisans of the medieval and early modern towns so as eventually to make possible the predominantly indoors civilization of the industrial economy . Little as we know about the transformation of Western civilization , there are many elements in the process which are as well known and as significant as those which have been mentioned , of which , however , the present discussion can take no account . For it is in no sense a history but rather an analysis of the nature of the process of industrial revolution . But enough has been said to indicate that what we know of this process clearly identifies it as an industrial revolution in the strictest interpretation of the phrase : a series of social changes , affecting every aspect of life , in which " mechanical invention " plays a decisive part . We know that the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad enough to include pure science and fine art , both of which interact continuously with mechanical invention in the narrower sense , and we know that such interaction is no new thing . The introduction of the Hindu-Arabic numerals , for example , was surely no less important to science than to business and to // craftsmanship . Indeed , scientists almost begrudge Leonardo Fibonacci his commercial interests . Science ( astronomy ) endowed industry ( navigation ) with the astrolabe ; but industry ( optical glass ) presented the same science with the telescope . We also know that this process ? the series of social changes in which technological innovation plays a decisive part ? has been going on in essentially the same fashion throughout modern times . The " revolution in coal and iron " and the " revolution in textiles , " to cite the familiar phrases , were no more industrial than the invention of printing or the building of ocean-going ships ; nor were the social consequences of these earlier innovations less significant or farreaching than those of the steam engine and the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is credited by Pirenne with having established that a " revolution in transport " occurred in western Europe in the eleventh and twelfth centuries to which the conventional phrase is no less applicable than to railway building . Thinking in terms of the classical tradition , economists have done their best to attribute this whole process to the institutions of capitalism . But that beautiful hypothesis is now being upset by brutal facts . An understanding of technological process is sufficient to establish the reverse . It is already clear that technological innovation played the decisive part in establishing the institutions of capitalism . By making industry paramount in modern life , the industrial revolution has made the captains of industry powerful . Power is certainly important . The process of institutional adaptation to technological change is therefore tremendously important as well as subtle and complicated , and special attention must therefore be given to it . But before this can be done it will be necessary to consider the nature of that other , ceremonial , aspect of behavior in terms of which the institutional system and its changes must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATTEMPT to analyze that aspect of behavior from which technology is to be distinguished , the student is at once confronted with terminological difficulties . Although a great many writers have made the distinction more or less clearly and consistently , no single term has come into any-thing like general use to refer to nontechnological behavior as a whole . ' Veblen used the word " ceremonial " in this // connection , and it will have to serve for the present . But it must be used with caution from the outset . In particular the student must guard against the identification of " ceremonial behavior " with the vestigial ceremonies of which modern life affords so many instances , " mere " ceremonies which have lost the greater part of their original meaning and are now carried on for no particular reason by force of social habit . Academic life affords many instances of vestigial ceremonies of this sort . For example , commencement ceremonies are recognized by the academic community as " a lot of mumbo-jumbo " inherited from a remote past and carried on for no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain event by recalling its past associations . Pursued with caution , however , the analysis even of " mere " ceremonies may have valuable results . Thus it is quite evident that even the most vestigial ceremony contains an element of " make-believe . " We pretend that a person upon whom the degree has been conferred is in some subtle qualitative sense a different individual . He is now a " doctor of philosophy , " entitled to all the advantages and emoluments which that rank confers as well as subject to its duties and responsibilities . No one really supposes that the commencement ceremony has made this difference . All it does is to " celebrate " the successful completion of the candidate 's studies and researches , an event which has been effectively marked by examinations presumably of an explicitly technological character corresponding to the " workmanlike " activities which have preceded them . To be sure , ceremonial elements do creep into these activities and even into the examinations which are presumed to test only the // technical adequacy of the preparation , a circumstance which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns . But the avowedly ceremonial character of the commencement exercises does not prevent their being taken seriously . However . brilliant a young scholar may be and however genuine his contributions to the sum of human knowledge , the fact that he has not " taken his doctor 's de-gree " is accounted a blemish on his character . As a well-known American sociologist once remarked , " It 's easier to take the degree than to spend the rest of your life explaining why you did n't ! " Behind such a ceremony there looms the phenomenon of status . As we continually explain to the impatient young , that is the way the world is , and we are all bound by it willy-nilly . Each of us knows , as a scholar , that the quality of scholarship is all that counts . But not only is the world at large ignorant of such matters , its thinking is dominated by considerations of status to which each of us as an individual is therefore obliged to conform . The schools and colleges and even the industrial research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all under the necessity of " putting up a front . " It is not enough for them to make a sincere effort to engage competent scientists and scholars ; they must be able to boast that possession of a Ph.D . degree is a condition of membership in their organiza-tions . That is what the community expects . Trustees and executive vice-presidents are impressed by considerations of rank ; and consequently the universities are obliged to co-operate by conferring rank , and the young scholar must cooperate by achieving the rank which will enable college presidents and industrial executive officers to engage him without embarrassment . Obviously this phenomenon of rank and status is a uni-versal one . We sometimes call it " feudal , " and so it is in the sense that feudal society was permeated by considerations // of rank and status . But this is only the most general characterization of the feudal order . In this sense and to some degree all societies are " feudal . " What distinguishes the feudal system of medieval Europe is the peculiar character of the particular system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western society still contains many vestiges of those specific status relationships . But the organization of society in terms of some sort of system of rank is a universal phenomenon . All societies exhibit cases of it . The investigation of kinship systems and of divisions of rank and status along the lines of age , sex , occupation , and the rest , is one of the principal concerns of anthropologists and sociologists . In our own society the system is so bewilderingly complex and multifarious as to constitute one of the chief concerns of all individuals throughout their lives . The informal education of children , of which we often say that it is much more important after all than formal education , consists largely in learning who are the " right " people and why ; but this concern is by no means limited to childhood . The first difficulty with which the young scholar will be confronted when he becomes a member of the staff to which he aspires , apparently in good standing since he has conformed to the requirement that he be a doctor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special influence exerted on the organization by certain of its older members , an influence which he sees at once can have no relation to scholarly achievement . This influence , he may eventually learn , derives from their descent from one of the " old families " of the region , or from their possession of large private- means , circumstances which perhaps lead the trustees or executive vice-presidents to regard their beneficiaries as " one of themselves " in a sense that may not be true even of the president . In contemplating these familiar aspects of our social life , many people cherish the belief that such cases are only minor deviations from " actual merit " which still remains the // prevailing basis for discriminations of rank . After all , how-ever spurious certain academic reputations may turn out to be , it still remains true that the scholarly attainments of Ph.D . ' s as a group are greater than those of non-Ph.D. ' s as a group . This belief is probably stronger in our own society than in any other , and it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . If so , the difference is very significant indeed for the future of industrial society and challenges serious investigation . ' But to some degree it pre-vails quite generally and exemplifies two universal features of the ceremonial pattern of behavior . One is the " make-believe " character of ceremonial behavior by virtue of which distinctions of rank and status ape differences of techno-logical competence . There is no people and no individual to whom technological competence is not a genuine reality . Consequently the greatest possible genuineness that can be imputed to any distinction of rank is the supposition that it coincides with technological reality . Anthropologists report that if a member of a primitive community be asked why the members of the community regard the cultivation of crops as " women 's work , " he will invariably reply that women are the only ones who can make crops grow . This state of mind is universal . Our own community cherishes the belief that only men can drive nails and only women can boil water without burning it , that only business men and generals can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are prepared to die . Vilhjalmur Stefansson re-ports that until quite recently European explorers in the arctic have believed so firmly that only a born Eskimo can build a snow igloo that in the absence of Eskimos they have shivered and died in oiled silk tents , apparently without even making the attempt to master this esoteric art which he offers to teach any boy of twelve by mail . Such beliefs are not actuated by technological reality .
