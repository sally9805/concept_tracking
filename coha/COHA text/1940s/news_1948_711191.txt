txt THE ceaseless struggles and gradual emergence of Adolf Hitler as a national figure were little noticed ny the victors , oppressed and harassed as they were by their own troubles and party.strife . A long interval passed before National Socialism or the " Nazi Party " , as it came to be called , gained so strong a hold of the masses of the German people , of the armed forces , of the machinery of the State , and among industrialists not unreasonably terrified of Communism , as to become a power in German life of which world-wide notice had to be taken . * * It is natural that a proud people vanquished in war should strive to rearm themselves as soon as possible . The responsibility , therefore , of enforcing a continual state of military disarmament upon a beaten foe rests upon the victors . For this purpose they must pursue a two-fold policy . First , while remaining sufficiently armed themselves , they must enforce with tireless vigilance and authority the clauses of the treaty which forbid the revival of their late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that is possible to reconcile the defeated nation to its lot by acts of benevolence designed to procure the greatest amount of prosperity in the beaten country , and labour by every means to create a basis of true friendship and of common interests , so that the incentive to appeal again to arms will be continually diminished . In these years I coined the maxim , " The redress of the grievances of the vanquished should precede the disarmament of the victors . " As will be seen , the reverse process was , to a large extent , followed by Britain , the United States and France . And thereby hangs this tale . While deadly changes were taking place in Germany , the Government felt bound to enforce for some time the severe reductions and restrictions which the financial crisis had imposed upon our already modest armaments , and steadfastly closed their eyes and ears to the disquieting symptoms in Europe . In vehement efforts to procure a disarmament of the victors equal to that which had been enforced upon the vanquished by the Treaty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed a series of proposals forward in the League of Nations and through every other channel that was open . The French , although their political affairs atill remained in constant flux and in motion without particular significance , clung tenaciously to the French Army as the centre and prop of the life of France and of all her alliances . This attitude earned them rebukes both in Britain and in the United States . The opinions of the Press and public were in no way founded upon reality ; but the adverse tide was strong . When in May , 1932 , the virtues of disarmament were extolled in the House of Commons by all parties , I gave my first formal warning of approaching war : I should very much regret to see any approximation in military strength between Germany and France . Those who speak of that as though it were right , or even a question of fair dealing , altogether underrate the gravity of the European situation . I would say to those who would like to see Germany and France on an equal footing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For my part , I earnestly hope that no such approximation will take place during my lifetime or that of my children . To say that is not in the least to imply any want of regard or admiration for the great qualities of the German people , but I am sure that the thesis that they should be placed in an equal military position with France is one which , if it ever emerged in fact , would bring us within practical distance of almost measureless calamity . * * UNDER the so-called National Government British public opinion showed an increasing inclination to cast aside all care about Germany . When in 1932 the German delegation to the Disarmament Conference categorically demanded the removal of all restrictions upon their right to rearm , they found much support in the British Press . The Times spoke of " the timely redress of inequality , " and The New Statesman of " the unqualified recognition of the principle of the equality of States . " This meant that the seventy million Germans ought to be allowed to rearm and prepare for war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make any objection . Equality of status between victors and vanquished ; equality between a France of thirty-nine millions and a Germany of nearly double that number ! His Majesty 's Government produced on March 16 , 1933 , what was called after its author and inspirer " The Plan . " It accepted as its starting-point the adoption of the French conception of short-service armies ? in this case of eight months ' service  --  and proceeded to prescribe exact , figures for the troops of each country . The French Army should be reduced from its peace-time establishment of 500,000 men to 200,000 and the Germans should increase to parity at that figure . I viewed thig attack upon the French armed forces and the attempt to establish equality between Germany and France with strong aversion ; and on March 23 , 1933 , I had the opportunity of saying to Parliament : I doubt the wisdom of pressing this plan upon France at the present time . I do not think the French will agree . They must be greatly concerned at what is taking place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some others of their neighbours . I dare say that during this anxious month there are a good many people who have said to themselves , as I have been saying for several years : " Thanir God for the French Array " . And again in April : Nothing in life is eternal , but as surely as Germany acquires full military equality with her neighbors while her own grievances are still unredressed and while she is in the temper which we have unhappily seen , so surely should we see ourselves within a measurable distance of the renewal of general European war . When one considers that the facts were hardly in dispute , the actions of a responsible government of respectable men and the public opinion which so flocculently supported them are scarcely comprehensible . It was like being smothered by a feather-bed . I remember particularly the look of pain and aversion which I saw on the faces of members in all parts of the House when I said , " Thank God for the French Army . " Words were vain . It is difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness of the French Governments , who none the less reflected the opinion of their Parliaments in this disastrous period . Nor can the United States escape the censure of history . Absorbed in their own affairs and all the abounding interests , activities and accidents of a free community , they simply gaped at the vast changes which were taking place in Europe , and imagined they were no concern of theirs . The considerable corps of highly competent , widely-trained professional American officers formed their own bpinions , but these produced no noticeable effect upon the improvident aloofness of American forei.n policy . If the influence of the United States had been exerted , it might have galvanised the French and British politicians into action . The League of Nations , battered though it had been , was still an august instrument which would have invested any challenge to the new Hitler warmenace with the sanctions of International Law . Under the strain the Americans merely shrugged their shoulders , so that in a few years they had to pour out the blood and treasures of the new world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of 1931 to tul - dertake a considerable lecture tour in the United States , and travelled to New York immediately after this speech . Here I suffered a serious accident , which nearly cost me my life . On December 13 when on my way to visit Mr. Bernard Baruch , I got out of my car on the wrong aide , and walked across Fifth Avenue without bearing in mind the opposite rule of the road which prevails in America , or the red-lights , then unused in Britain . There was a shattering collision . For two months I was a wreck . 1 gradually regained at Nassau in the Bahamas enough strength to crawl around . In this condition I undertook a tour of forty lectures throughout the United States , living all day on my back in a railway compartment , and addressing in the evening large audiences . On the whole I consider this was the hardest time I have had in my life . I lay pretty low all through this year ; but in time my strength returned . The years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public affairs , were personally very pleasant to me . I earned my livelihood ' 33 , dictating articles which had a wide circulation not only in Great Britain and the United States , but also , before Hitler 's shadow fell upon them , in the most famous newspapers of sixteen European countries . I lived in fact from mouth to hand . I produced in succession the various volumes of the " Life of Marlborough . " I meditated constantly upon the European situation and the rearming of Germany . I lived mainly at Chartwell , where I had much to amuse me . I built with my own hands a large part of two cottages and extensive kitchen-garden. walls , and made all kinds of rockeries and waterworks and a large swimming-pool which was filtered to limpidity and could be hea ' . ed to supplement our fickle sunshine . Thus I never had a dull or idle moment from morning till midnight , and with my happy family around me dwelt at peace within my habitation . During these years 1 saw a great deal of Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindemann was already an old friend of mine . " The Prof , " as he was called among his friends , became my chief adviser on the scientific aspects of modern war and particularly of air defence , and also on questions involving statistics of all kinds . This pleasant and fertile association continued throughout the war . Another of my close friends was Desmond Morton . * In 1919 , when I became Secretary of State for War and Air , I appointed him to a post in the Intelligence , which he held for many years . He was a neighbour of mine , dwelling only a mile away from Chartwell . He obtained from the * Now Major Sir Desmond Morton , K.C.B. , M.C. . ThE PROF ' Frecleri.c.7 . ' Mae New Itcerla Times - Prime Minister , Mr. , permission to talk freely to me and keep me well informed . He became , and continued during the war to be , one of my most intimate advisers till our final victory was won . I had also formed a friendship with Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the centre of all its affairs . He had reached a level in that Department which entitled him to express responsible opinions upon policy , and to use a wide discretion in his contacts , official and unofficial . Like other officials of high rank , he spoke to me with complete confidence . It was of great value to me , and it may be thought also to the country , that I should have the means of conducting searching and precise discussions for so many years in this very small circle . On my side however I gathered and contributed a great deal of information from foreign sources . I had confidential contacts with several of the French Ministers and with the successive Chiefs of the French Government . Mr. Ian Colvin , the son of the famous leader-writer of the Morning Post , was the News Chronicle correspondent in Berlin . He plunged very deeply into German politics , and established contacts of a most secret character with some of the important German generals , and also with independent men of character and quality in Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their native land . Several visitors of consequence came to me from Germany and poured their hearts out in their bitter distress . Most of these were executed by Hitler during the war . From other . directions I was able to check and furnish information on the whole field of our air defence . In this way I became ? as well instructed as many Ministers of the Crown . All the facts I gathered from every source , including especially foreign connections , I reported to the Government from time to time . My personal relations with Ministers and also with many of their high officials were close and easy and , although I was often their critic , we maintained a spirit of comradeship . Later on , as will be seen , I was made officially party to much of their most secret teithnical knowledge . From my own long experience in high office I was also possessed of the most precious-secrets of the State . All this enabled me to form and maintain opinions which did not depend on what was published in the newspapers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reader will pardon a personal digression in a lighter vein . In the summer of 1932 for the purposes of my " Life of Marlborough " I visited his old battlefields in the Low Countries and Germany . After passing a day on the field of Blenheim , I drove into Munich and spent the best part of a week there . At the Regina Hotel a gentleman introduced himself to some of my party . He was Herr Hanfstaengl , and spoke a great deal about " the Fuehrer , " with whom he appeared to be intimate . As he seemed to-be a lively and talkative fellow , speaking excellent English , I asked him to dine . He gave a most interesting account of Hitler 's activities and outlook . He spoke as one under the spell . He had probably been told to get in touch with me . He was evidently most anxious to please . After dinner he went to the piano and played and sang many tunes and songs in such remarkable style that we all enjoyed ourselves immensely . He seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a great entertainer , and at that time , as is known , a favourite of the Fuehrer . He said I ought to meet him , and that nothing would be easier to arrange . Herr Hitler came every day to the ? hotel about 5 o'clock , and would be very glad indeed to see me . ' I had no national prejudices against Hitler at this time : I knew little of his doctrine or record and nothing of his character . I admire men who stand up for their country in defeat , even though I am on the other side . He had a perfect right to be a patriotic German if he chose . I always wanted England , Germany and France to be friends . However , in the course of conversation with Hanfstaengl , I happened to say " Why is your chief so violent about the Jews ? I can quite understand being angry with Jews who have done wrong or are against the country , and I understand resisting them if they try to monopolise power in any walk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man simply because of his birth ? How can any man help how he is born ? " He must have repeated this to Hitler , because about noon the next day he came round with rather a serious air and said that the appointment he had made with me to meet Hitler could not take place as the Fuehrer would not be coming to the hotel that afternoon . This was the last I saw of " Putzi " ? for such was his pet name  --  although we stayed several more " days at the hotel . Thus* Hitler lost his only chance of meeting me . Later on when he was all-powerful , I was to receive several invitations from him . But by that time a lot had happened , and I excused myself . . ... LL this while the United States remained intensely preoccupied with its own vehement internal affairs and economic problems . Europe and far-off Japan watched with steady gaze the rise of German warlike power . Deep anxiety ruled in France . This was one of those awful periods which recur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall from its high estate , loses all trace of sense or purpose , and appears to cower from the menace of foreign peril , frothing pious platitudes while foemen forge their arms . , We must regard as deeply blameworthy before history the conduct not only of the British National and mainly Conservative Government , but- of the Labour-Socialist and Liberal Parties , both in and out of office , during this fatal period . Delight in smooth-sounding phrases ; refusal to face unpleasant facts , desire for popularity and electoral success irrespective of the vital interests of the State , genuine love of peace and pathetic belief that love can be its sole foundation , obvious lack of intellectual vigour in both leaders of the British Coalition Government , marked ignorance of Europe and aversion from its problems in Mr. Baldwin , the strong and violent pacifism which at this time dominated the Labour-Socialist Party , the utter devotion of the Liberals to sentiment- apart frazia ? Boob I ? From War to War reality , the failure and worse than failure of Mr. Lloyd George , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continuity of his work , the whole supported by overwhelming majorities in both Houses of Parliament : all these constituted a picture of British fatuity and fecklessness which , though devoid of guile , was not devoid of guilt , and , though free from wickedness or evil design , played a definite part in the unleashing upon the world of horrors and miseries which , even so far as they have unfolded , are already beyond comparison in human experience .
