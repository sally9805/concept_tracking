MEDITATIONS IN WALL STREET-Anonymous-Morrow ( $1.50 ) . <P> When Meditations in Wall Street appeared early last month , it induced a fair amount of speculation about the identity of the anonymous author . In his fussily graceful preface , Albert Jay Nock implied not only that Mr. " A. B. " is dead but that he is embalmed in more than a few grains of salt . A reviewer for Commonweal suggested that Nock was merely hiding behind himself . In the Herald Tribune , Banker-Littrateur Lewis Galantiere unveiled the Meditator as his " master , " Dr. Erasmus Beebe , " the recluse of Remsen Street .

A. B. 's meditations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " the gods , " and " Milady " ) . But a great many are sharply perspicacious , quietly durable . <P> Well-deserved , in fact , is Sponsor Albert Jay Nock 's boost : " A worthy , unusual and original contribution to American letters .
