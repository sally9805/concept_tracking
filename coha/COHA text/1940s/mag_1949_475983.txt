ONE day in March 1948 , framed by the gilt plaster and brocades of the lounge of Grosvenor House , a Welsh bookmaker and football pool promoter called Abe Sherman was sitting talking to a Rabbi , when he was approached by Mr. Sidney Stanley , who offered him his help in certain business difficulties which were then besetting him . Mr. Stanley asserted that he could perform this service through his friendship with the parliamentary secretary to the Board of Trade , Mr. Belcher . Mr. Stanley at that moment is one of the most pathetic figures of all time . It was his intention to get to know , and to get the better of , Mr. Abe Sherman 's brother Harry , who was the more dominating figure in thefamily business . So might a young and uninstructed medieval German have sought to meet the Iron Maiden of Nuremberg for the purpose of seducing her . They had a common place of origin , Mr. Stanley and Mr. Harry Sherman . Both were born in Poland . But in all else they differ . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white and hard and shining , as if he were made of glass and marble . His receding hair is sharply silver ; his high forehead has prominent gleaming temples which look like the drawings of planets in old-fashioned books on astronomy ; the thick lenses of his spectacles catch the light ; he dresses by preference in battleship gray . He , the true artist , has nothing of the picturesqueness , the antique dignity , which so curiously solemnize the clownishness of Mr. Stanley , the demi-artist . Harry Sherman 's father was a tailor in the drab dockside district of the Welsh port of Cardiff . He started in his father 's workroom , but was soon making money as a bookmaker 's runner after hours . Cardiff has always been a great town for gambling , so there was a future for bookmakers ; and Harry had an aptitude for the work . The successful bookmaker must have a sound and quick mathematical brain , and Harry is the mathematician in excelsis . Most of the prOblems relating to chance within the numerical field which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century by the highly intelligent gamblers of the time . Harry Sherman is master of that body of knowledge , and has added to it where the changed forms of the age have required an addition . It is said that he finds no real pleasure in anything else , and it is to be doubted if money delights him much , for he has bought little with it . His life might be described as the history of a mathematical gift wholly dissociated from the culture which is the usual setting of such gifts ; on its own , like a ghost . The Shermans were so poor that he could not set up as a bookmaker even in the smallest way till one of his elder brothers went to sea and financed him with his savings . Even so it took him a long time to disengage himself from the nameless thousands clown by the docks . Nobody in Cardiff remembers him before he reached his late thirties . But he went steadily ahead , not even deflected by the depression of the late twenties ; and as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opened two other branches in Wales , one in another seaport , another in a coal town . Till then , he had taken bets only on horse racing and football and prizefights , but Providence , who has watched over him with a kindliness it has shown toward fevii inhabitants of the British Isles , was to extend his sphere . When dog racing started in Cardiff , a great many people who had never bet before took to laying money on the dogs . This vast new public was as much of a windfall as most industries get in a generation . And only five years after the rise of dog racing came the football pools , which turned a third of the population of Great Britain into habitual gamblers : the mildest of gamblers , but habitual ones . EVERY Wednesday night these sixteen millions fill in their football pool coupons : they have to be posted Thursday night . They are slips of paper , issued by thirty-four pool organizations to their subscribers , printed with the names of the football teams which are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bettor to put his money on hazards of different degrees of complication . It fills my eyes with the tears of boredom to look at them ; but 1 am told by some of my friends that they derive something of the same sort of entertainment from filling them in as they get from crossword puzzles . The stake can he from ten cents up to forty dollars , and the prizes come within each organization from the pooled stakes after the Chancellor of the Exchequer has taken a ten per cent cut and the promoters have taken a five per cent cut plus their expenses . The sum of the stakes put up in the past twelve months has been guessed at two hundred million dollars ; and bettors who have won on the more complicated hazards have drawn as much as three hundred thousand dollars as a single prize . Now , here lies the peculiar charm of the football pool . Under our present system of taxation there is almost no way by which a man not already in possession of a great fortune could now acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation of Great Britain makes it almost impossible for any but a few of the richest men , or a very lucky pioneer of a new industry , to acquire this sum by capital appreciation . Nobody could save it out of the handsomest income unless he started in infancy and lived parsimoniously into the nineties . Recent legislation has abolished the development of real estate as a source of wealth by turning all increases in land values over to the state . Only by gambling could an Englishman today get himself a good , satisfying hunk of capital such as , till a time within the living memory of everybody middle-aged or over , it was not at all impossible for a man born poor to acquire by his own industry . There is no provincial town in Great Britain where , up till the past generation , the children playing in the streets could not look up as a man of wealth and power drove by and tell each other that he had once been like themselves . Now the hope that dreams can come true is given only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such winnings are few there are many smaller winnings , which , even if they are no more than a shilling or two , have the intoxicating charm of not being taxed . Never , therefore , has gambling had such emotional force behind it . This gambling is life itself in rebellion against the bonds of necessity , kicking as it must if it is not to die . So for the past seventeen years Mr. Sherman has had not only the horses and the dogs and the football players but life itself working for him , extending his empire of numbers , his mathematical interpenetration of society . The pools are all owned by bookmakers ; and when they started Harry Sherman was by no means the most important bookmaker in Great Britain , so his pool was among the smaller ones . Now he has so well exploited his advantages that it is the third , and a long way above its next competitors , and his five per cent cut amounts to something over fifteen hundred thousand dollars a year . That cut is taxed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new industry which gives its promoters such returns . But he deserves it . The organization is perfect . It spreads through Cardiff filling the old vessels wherever the old wine has been poured out . The town once had a fine newspaper called the Western Mail , which the rising costs of production forced into a sale and amalgamation with another local paper . Sherman 's pool has it now . A great engineering firm which found at the end of the war that it had no use for two of its great sheds was fastidious and would not sell them to Sherman , and gave them to another buyer ; Sherman bought them from the buyer . It is true that from time to time disagreeable incidents have happened within his orbit in Cardiff , which must have jarred his sensitiveness . A rising bookmaker in the town wanted to make larger bets on his own account with Mr. Sherman , and in the long run lost , so Mr. Sherman sued him for his losses . Once the case got into the papers and it was known that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of his clients would bet with him again . The night before the case came on some of his friends saw a light burning in his office later than was customary , went in to cheer him up , and found him hanging from a hook on the door . A young man who had had some luck making a book . with Mr. Sherman went on and on until he had laid five thousand pounds on the result of one football match , and lost . He proved to be a cashier with a weekly wage of a pound or two , and had to go to jail . But not in these or any other tragedies was there any suggestion that Mr. Sherman had behaved in a way unworthy of a distinguished member of his profession . Once the shadow of an unjust accusation fell on him and lie was tried for forging a check , but he was acquitted . His personal relations would seem as unclouded as his professional life . He has been closely united to his brothers all his life and they have worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over sixty , when he took a very rich wife . As for friends , there are no emotional complications there . If one makes inquiry in Cardiff , the townspeople read the question back in perplexity . Who are Harry Sherman 's friends ? " they repeat . " Oh , Harry Sherman has n't any friends . Oh , yes , he 'll say , ' Hello , Tom , ' and I 'll say , Hello , Harry , ' but we 're not friends . He keeps himself to himself , always has done , never was close to anybody . " Harry Sherman has seen enough of prominent public men to take his physical pattern from them . Nobody could now tell from his appearance or his speech that he is the tailor 's son who was once a dockside bookmaker . He is neatly groomed , wears a quiet good suit , and speaks without provincialisms and with reserve . By his appearance of conformity it may be seen that lie is not attacking the old order , the South " Wales as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their power ; he is merely taking it over . zI BUT there is one cloud in all this fair weather , a black cloud . Mr. Sherman had been worried about the paper allocation for his pools . The football pools use an enormous amount of paper , and we are only gradually emerging from a period which had to regard paper as a luxury to be doled out in driblets . During the war the pools were unified and strictly controlled , but in 1946 they were allowed to function individually again , and the government , through the Board of Trade , made a general allocation of paper to the Football Pool Promoters ' Association and told the members to settle among themselves the proportions in which the paper should be doled out to the various promoters . In making this arrangement the Board of Trade was guilty of drooling ineptitude to a point rare in the government departments of Great Britain or America ; and the case against it begins here . This might have been a sensible arrangement for the distribution of raw materials to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manned by the most ardent spirits in the bookmaking world . The Board of Trade should have made each file his demand separately , basing it on his prewar number of subscribers , checked his figures , and smacked down his just allocation on the counter . The system of letting the allocations be settled by the Football Pool Promoters ' Association worked out as might have been expected . The situation became an arena of personal hatreds , of which one of the most spectacular was between Harry Sherman and the promoter of a pool then larger than his called Alfred Cope . Cope is a slender young man , hard and black and shining as a piece of anthracite , who has never had to struggle , who inherited a great bookmaking business , with an upper-and middle-class clientele , from an uncle . These two hate one another as Romeo and Juliet loved each other ; it is one of the great romances of loathing . From the dust of the contests which raged in this arena , Mr. Harry Sherman always went back to Cardiff feeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocation to which the size of his pool entitled him . W lIEN in 1948 the Association came to an end under the terms of its charter , a new Association was formed , and Harry Sherman was not asked to join it . Thereafter , he was told , he had to get his allocation direct from the Board of Trade . He may well have thought that this was a better arrangement and that he would now get his rights . But he was to be disappointed . His football pool had enormously increased in numbers . He did not get anything like the paper allocation to which , in his opinion , he was entitled . Harry Sherman 's sense of injustice had been additionally inflamed from the end of 1947 by a prosecution which had been started against him by the Board of Trade . Various regulations had been passed to prevent the football pools from using more than the bare minimum of paper , and one of them made it illegal to send a pool coupon to any person who had not paid at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been framed by an imbecile . It had the object of discouraging the pools from wasting paper in touting for new subscribers , but it was certain to afford munition for the gang warfare between the different pool promoters . No disinterested person receiving a free pool coupon was likely to go to the police and complain about it , or do anything except crumple it up and throw it into the wastepaper basket , or use it . But a pool promoter might very well arrange for a number of his subscribers to accept free coupons from a rival pool promoter and then complain about it to the police . It is almost impossible to imagine a prosecution brought under this regulation which would not be subject to the gravest suspicion ; but at the end of 1947 the Board of Trade started proceedings against Sherman 's Pools Ltd. for sending out free coupons to twenty-two persons . The hearing before the Stipendiary Magistrate for Cardiff , at a time when all law courts in England were overburdened with arrears of work , lasted six days . The Stipendiary Magistrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of futility , died . The Board of Trade intimated that they intended to have the case retried and to add additional charges in respect to other cases of free distribution of coupons . This must have irritated Mr. Harry Sherman , but it is probable that the matter of the paper allocation worried him much more . in the one case he had only the prospect of a fine to pay , and it is obvious that paying is what he can do ; God has made that easy for him . But in the case of the paper allocation , he was prevented from extending his pools at a time when he wanted to make them as big as possible . THEN , in March 1948 , Harry Sherman 's brother , Abe Sherman , was interrupted while discoursing with a Rabbi by little Mr. Stanley , who said in effect that he knew all about the Shermans ' difficulty concerning the paper allocation and had a useful friend named Belcher who was parliamentary secretary to the president . of the Board of Trade . Some little time after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for twenty-eight hundred dollars which was supposed to be payment for a number of extremely successful bets he had made . Mr. Harry Sherman then came up to London and saw Mr. Stanley , and was , it is said , at first enchanted by him . It must never be forgotten that the little creature was indeed an enchanter . We all want to laugh , we all want to believe that if we say , " Open Sesame , " the door of the cave will open and we will find ourselves among the diamonds and rubies and ingots of gold . Mr. Stanley could make any of us , even Harry Sherman , laugh ; and perhaps Harry Sherman more than most could appreciate legends of fairy gold that was more easily come by and lovelier than the gold mined by men . While Mr. Stanley told his Scheherazade tale , Mr. Belcher had brief and provocative meetings with Mr. Sherman , the nature of which is unknown save to him and his Maker . As a result of all these meetings Mr. Belcher saw to it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Board of Trade had been strongly of the opinion that it ought to be reheard . It is to be noted that the legal officials were lukewarm to continue the prosecution , but they were whipped up by a Mr. Harold Gray , who was then in charge of the paper section of the Raw Material Department . Mr. Gray was extremely anxious not to let Mr. Sherman escape ; and he was so adamant in his resolution that the Sherman prosecution should continue , and sent up such a strong minute to the permanent secretary of the Board of Trade , Sir John Woods , that Sir John sanctioned the reopening of the case before the successor of the dead Stipendiary Magistrate . Mr. Belcher then by-passed them all , reporting to the president of the Board of Trade that the prosecution should be withdrawn and theregulation about free football coupons be revoked . It is typical of the confusion in this case that this was obviously the sensible course to take , yet it is because Mr. Belcher took it that he was judged unfit to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his action showed , he was not moved by a concern for justice and the social good but by a wish to repay Mr. Stanley for the various benefactions he had received from him . T TIE prosecution was formally withdrawn in Court at Cardiff on May H. On June 1 , after much dickering in Cardiff and London , a singular cash transaction took place between Mr. Sherman and Mr. Stanley . Mr. Sherman gave . Mr. Stanley a check for twenty thousand dollars as a loan , and Mr. Stanley gave him as security two checks ; one was his personal check for twenty thousand dollars , and the other a check drawn in his favor by Lass &; Company , a firm he had worked for six years before . This security was peculiar . No spring flower known is as ephemeral as Mr. Stanley 's personal checks were known to be ; and the Lass check was in fact stolen and forged , and even if it had not been so , would have been invalid , for it was signed by only one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them , and he had committed suicide some years earlier than the date which was on the check . Such a check might have been useful to a person who , fearing that Mr. Stanley might try to doublecross him , wished to hold some document which he could use against him if he saw signs of coming treachery . What use Mr. Harry Sherman had found for it he never explained in the witness box . On June 23 , Mr. Harry Sherman very handsomely lent Mr. Stanley another twenty-eight thousand dollars against the fragile security of one of his personal checks ; and it happened that on the very same day they visited Mr. Belcher down at the House of Commons and talked to him once again about the paper allocation for the pools . Very agreeably Mr. Belcher told Mr. Sherman that they had better go into the figures at the Board of Trade , and gave him an appointment for the next day . Mr. Sherman and Mr. Stanley must have looked a strange pair as they went out through the Victorian Gothic shadows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament patriarch , but his passions are more abstract , since he is neither a moralist nor a leader of men , but a mathematician . Rather he might be one of the vast bearded demigods who hold their great heads and groan over incomprehensibly complicated sorrows in the Prophetic Books of William Blake ; and perhaps those books are really prophetic , and William Blake was looking through the years at the fleshless intricacies of minds which can only think in numbers , yet can suffer distress , as naked wires can transmit electric currents . Mr. Stanley also belongs to the Old Testament , but not in the same class as Mr. Sherman ; he is the sort of light-minded person whom the patriarchs and prophets disliked almost as much as strange women , and there were also moments when , hieratic and chubby and wistful , he might have been an infant Samuel who had never the luck to hear the Lord call in the night . But he was also modern in the most pitiful way . His lilac eyelids were heavy , his pale full mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the strength of his desire to be somebody that he could have been only if he had not let the barbarians of the world around him blot out the traditional culture which he had inherited . But at the moment those two very different men were wrapped in a common contentment . Mr. Sherman was pleased because he thought that he was going to get his paper allocation increased . Mr. Stanley was pleased at some plan he had conceived and was executing which made him assure Mr. Sherman that he was right in the supposition , and that he could safely tell Mr. Belcher all the details of his sad story , even though this would mean revealing that he had been using paper in excess of his allocation which he must have bought on the black market . To make quite sure that Mr. Sherman should let Mr. Belcher have this important piece of information , Mr. Stanley told him that Mr. Belcher already knew it . This curious maneuver was the means of sharply terminating Mr. Sher-man 's pleasure on the morrow . When he went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Belcher but by Mr. Gray , the head of the paper department who had shown some anxiety to prosecute MAGAZINE him . The relations between Mr. Belcher and Mr. Gray must have passed through some awkward phases , for Mr. Gray had greatly resented his opinion regarding the prosecution being overruled and had presented a minute on the subject to the permanent secretary of the Board of Trade , Sir John Woods , who had made a complaint to the president of the Boarc : . of Trade , Mr. Harold Wilson . But at this interview Mr. Belcher and Mr. Gray were of one mind . As soon as Mr. Sherman followed the advice of Mr. Stanley and disclosed that he had exceeded the paper allocation , both Mr. Belcher and Mr. Gray expressed extreme annoyance and informed him that official investigators would be sent down to his Cardiff offices to find out the extent of his illegal activities . Then a fog fell on the situation . The first meeting between Mr. Sherman and Mr. Stanley after this announcement at the Board of Trade must surely have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los , bending down from the skies in wrath over a little Henry Moore figure , who said that if he were only given time he could explain everything . Yet Mr. Sherman himself could not remember this meeting when he was questioned about it by the Tribunal . But through the fog we catch glimpses of various jagged and prodigious events . It might have been thought that once the Board of Trade had decided to send investigating officers down to the Sherman headquarters it would have packed them off at once , so that the investigated enterprise would have no time to play with its ledgers and its warehoused goods . But the investigating officers took nearly a fortnight to get going . They did not arrive at Cardiff until July 9 . On July 10 , Mr. Sherman told Mr. Stanley that he was going to present for payment the Lass check for one hundred and eight thousand dollars . Mr. Sherman , however , did not present that check , for the reason , he says , that Mr. Stanley asked him not to do so for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost immediately , for the reason , it is said , that one of the Shermans was ill ; though why this should have prevented them going over the firm 's ledgers and warehouses is not obvious . Their retirement was only temporary . They reappeared on July 26 . Fox some time before this , there had been waiting on the edge of the Sherman 's world a certain middle-aged man named David Rufus Williams , who , with his own worn handsomeness , his rich precision of speech and gesture , and the slight bias to the picturesque in his dress , might have been a Shakespearian actor of the sort who is most often seen supporting , quite ably , an aging star . He was in fact a man of resource and resilience . He was an undischarged bankrupt and had in 1936 been convicted at the Old Bailey on a charge of fraudulent conversion of funds . Nevertheless he had succeeded in being appointed to a post which would normally have been given only to a person of unblemished character , and was , till this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire Association , a semi-official body which has its offices inside the Houses of Parliament . There he worked hard , often at more than his work as it was conceived by his superiors , for the reason that he not only looked like a Shakespearian actor but was a Shakespearian character himself . Shakespeare 's world is even more thickly populated with men who say they can fix things than the real world ; and Mr. Williams was a fixer . It is not easy to see why Mr. Sherman brought Mr. Rufus Williams into his counsels , unless it was that even he , made of white marble and the mathematical spirit , suffers from the shyness of the provincial . He had come to London , and he was beginning to suspect that some Londoners had diddled him ; and he did not feel the same confidence that he could wipe them out if they crossed him that he would have felt if he had been on his own stamping-ground in Cardiff . Rufus Williams made a bridge for him , for he was a member of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Williams was therefore called away from his beneficences , which at that moment included efforts to enable an English corporation to persuade the Board of Trade to withdraw their ban on the importation of German typewriters , and was told by Mr. Sherman of his troubles about the paper allocation , and asked to appeal on his behalf to Mr. Belcher , whom Mr. Williams seems to have known fairly well . When he did so , Mr. Belchersent a message by Mr. Stanley to Mr. Sherman , telling him not to pester him through Mr. Williams ; and Mr. Williams complains that he was called up on two occasions by an unknown person who , speaking with a foreign accent , told him that it would be better if he kept out of the Sherman affairs . This incident rings true , for it has a delicacy which is characteristic of the whole affair . In any other country the persons involved would by this time have been quite apt to get shot if they went out after dark . In this English embroilment the action furthest removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conducted in a foreign accent , as if Destiny wished to signify that even this was a trifle unEnglish . Then about the time that the investigators returned to Cardiff for a second assault on Mr. Sherman 's paper stocks , Mr. Sherman confided to Mr. Williams that he had had a painful scene with Mr. Stanley . Mr. Sherman had , he said , been pressing Mr. Stanley for repayment of the forty-eight thousand dollars he had lent him , and Mr. Stanley had told him that of course he was not going to repay it , as he had distributed the money in bribes to secure the withdrawal of the prosecution of Mr. Sherman by the Board of Trade in May . He had claimed that he had given a lump sum to a Law Officer of the Crown ( who had , in fact , never heard or seen any of the parties to the case , and had had nothing to do with the prosecution ) . He had claimed also that he had been giving Mrs. Belcher four hundred dollars whenever she asked for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible shock to him , and it shocked Mr. Williams too , to such a pitch that he became indefatigable in his efforts to see Mr. Belcher and tell him about it . In this step , he assured the Tribunal , he was moved by no hope of profit for himself , but simply by a friendly feeling for Mr. Belcher , who surely ought to know of such aspersions on his fair name . ON THE fifth of August , a week after the investigators had been installed in the Sherman offices , Mr. Williams told Mr. Belcher of the accusations Mr. Stanley had made against him and his wife to Mr. Sherman . Mr. Belcher disputes his version of this incident , and no son of man shall ever know the truth , for that day got tangled up with the booby traps and the barbed-wire entanglements which Fate scatters about when it has decided to go quite sour . Whatever Mr. Belcher understood Mr. Williams to say , it indicated that Mr. Stanley had been an indiscreet friend ; and that very evening Mr. Stanley was giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club which is a mild London version of the Stork Club . Mr. Belcher might have been expected not to go , but he was in a cleft stick . He had accepted invitations for his wife , a stern and just character , and Mr. James Haworth , a North Country Member of Parliament who shares his home , a person so patently simpleminded and honest that one at first suspects him , quite unjustly , of being a confidence trickster . These two had a common quality of persistence which would have made it impossible for him to absent himself from the party without giving his reasons , and if he had given them his real reason he would have provoked an outburst of upbraiding integrity . He could not even say that he had another engagement , because his private secretary and his wife , Mr. and Mrs. Cross , had also accepted the invitation and they would have known that he had none . So he attended the festivity , which was not gay . On arriving he repeated to Mr. Stanley what Mr. Williams had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to keep up appearances in front of the guests , but all the same things did not go with a swing , partly because Mr. Belcher had that day been fitted with a new set of false teeth which gave him great pain , and he was always rising and going out of the room to adjust it . The birthday party was evidently one of those outcrops of Hell which sometimes appear before us in our hours of need . From Mr. Belcher 's complaints Mr. Stanley must have realized that his relations with the Shermans had taken a dangerous turn . But he did nothing . The truth was that he not only looked like a statue but to all intents and purposes was a statue . He created an impression of boundless energy , but so can carven stone . The Discus Thrower is the essence of muscular effort , but the discus never leaves his hand . Mr. Stanley had conceived imaginatively the essence of a beautiful and rewarding co-operation between him and Mr. Harry Sherman , and he was content . He appears not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape the flood-tide of misfortune which could he seen thundering down on him . S ix days after the birthday party , Mr. Williams took Mr. Belcher to the Savoy Hotel to talk to Mr. Harry Sherman and his brother Abe , and there they repeated their story about their interview with Mr. Stanley , and his claims to have spent the forty-eight thousand dollars they had lent him on bribes to Mr. and Mrs. Belcher and Mr. Gray and the Law Officer of the Crown ; and they repeated it in terms so definite that Mr. Belcher could not thereafter plead that he had not understood what had been said of him . But he did not take the obvious course of going to his chief , the president of the Board of Trade , and reporting that as a result of his official actions he and Mr. Gray were being accused of bribery . Instead he went off to Bideford , in the west of England , to spend three weeks ' holiday with his family and his housemate , Mr. Haworth . A few days later he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who suggested that all inconvenience could be avoided if he would be reasonable about the paper allocation . But matters did not come to a head until , some days later still , Mr. Williams , the fixer , interposed once more . Mr. Williams took out to lunch Mr. Belcher 's secretary , a lanky young man in his middle twenties with a gentle manner and a confiding smile , named Cross , and put it to him that he had been among the persons whom Mr. Stanley said that he had bribed , and that it would be very unfortunate for everybody if this matter of the checks came into court , and that the Shermans were prepared to hush it all up if they could get fair treatment about their paper allocation . Here the Shermans and Mr. Williams were making a mistake that in this day the old and middle-aged are apt to make about the young . Mr. Sherman and Mr. Stanley and Mr. Williams and Mr. Belcher were one and all individualists ; they were now inviting into their sphere the kind of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy in its uniform . Mr. Cross , though he understood that his association with Mr. Belcher had been so close that he was bound to be the subject of grave suspicions if Mr. Belcher were found guilty of any crime , went to his superiors , and reported to them exactly what Mr. Williams had said to him . It followed that within a few weeks the world of these individualists was wholly overrun by other men in uniform . The government called in the police to investigate the affairs of Mr. Belcher and other Ministers of the Crown and civil servants who had fallen within the orbit of Mr. Stanley . It also made up its mind to have the findings of the police dealt with by a Tribunal called into being under the Tribunals of Inquiry ( Evidence ) Act of 1921 , a form of court quite shocking in its determination to serve the interests of the community at the expense of the individual . MR . STANLEY and Mr. Williams and Mr. Belcher could not have been expected to dodge this catastrophe . Mr. Stanley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natures would not have permitted them to fail . Mr. Belcher 's fondness for clich ? s and the inartistic quality of his geniality were signs of a real lack of discrimination , which would make it difficult for him to read any omen . But Mr. Sher-man 's intelligence was a bright light , and he had forgotten nothing he had seen in any of the dark places on which it shone ; he should have known that the society he lived in still kicks back when the individual takes too many liberties with it . But there was a dread hanging over him . The Board of Trade officials had threatened that if they found his excessive consumption of paper too outrageous they would cut off his allocation altogether , and this would have meant the closing down of his pools , the loss of over a million dollars profit a year , and the sweeping away of his magic web of numbers as if it were a cobweb . But there was stilt a stronger force within him that made him push on with his project of getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He believed in a just God . He knew that he was not getting his fair share of paper and he thought that anything he did to rectify this unfairness must be right , andcould not fail to prosper in the end . The three clays he spent in the witness box should have created a sordid impression , for he was telling stories which neither the judges nor anybody else in court believed , and he could confess no motive which was not grossly material ; yet he was clothed with the majesty of Job , who under affliction lifted his head to ask why he should be hunted as by a fierce lion . Strangely , he uplifted the heart by his dignity , and left the spectator bewildered as to where the arrow of hatred should rightly be shot . Mr. Stanley , too , did not appeal as a target for that archery . This was not only because he was as funny as Harpo Marx when he gave evidence . The orderly dignity which competed with the buffoon in him was impressive , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He showed great loyalty to the other people in the case . It is true that he swindled them , but only out of money . How good a friend he could be if that proviso were accepted was proved in the case of George Gibson . For all that the Shermans and other people had been paying him large checks night and day for months , Mr. Stanley suffered from that insolvency which is an occupational disease of the lawless , which sends every gangster penniless to his grave ; and finding himself wholly without means in the month of August he had lightheartedly embezzled two thousand dollars given him by Mr. Gibson for the purpose of buying shares . Nevertheless , he did all he could in his evidence to shield Gibson and save him from mockery . Indeed , Mr. Stanley was no simple rogue . About his very roguery the forces of his soul raged in conflict . When he was questioned about his financial transaction he took from his pocket a very large , very fine handkerchief , and wiped his hands with it , finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were saying , " Out , damned check . " He seemed sometimes to move right out of the page of modern experience , of waking life . Every three hours or so he was handed a glass of physic as he stood in the witness box . He was evidently one of those people who have transferred their infantile belief in magic to medicine ; faith shone in his pale face , he gulped it down as if absorbing safety . It was impossible to hate this man if one had ever had a high temperature and watched the pattern on the wallpaper come to goblin life , for he was in such a state of fevered fancy , imposing on reality pictures that came up from the wild depths of his mind . NOR could the persons under suspicion be hated , for they were mediocrities . Yet one of them aroused fear by the 1 ght she threw on what it is to be mediocre : t le identity of that state with confusion and lack of discrimination . This was Mrs. Belcher , who came before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made against her , and amazed it by the method she chose to emphasize her denial . She had taken the usual oath , and had sworn by Almighty God to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . But when she was asked if Mr. Stanley had given her any money she replied , " Never , on my word of honor , " and moistened her finger and drew it across her throat , as children do when they say , " My finger wet , my finger dry , cross my heart and let me die , if I tell you any lie . " The three judges looked at her in gentle perplexity . She was evidently not an atheist ; she had not refused to take the oath and asked to be allowed to make an affirmation ; yet she appeared to think that in repeating this childish rune she was giving a pledge more convincing and solemn than her oath . The court grew tender to her simplicity , which had indeed been betrayed by circumstance . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband had put himself under an obligation to Mr. Stanley , and was herself of a fiercely independent nature . It was entirely necessary for own sake that she should go before the Tribunal and clear herself of the charge that she had been given money by Mr. Stanley , but she appeared to think that she was being treated with indignity , even with indecency , when she was asked to give the figures of her bank account and her post office savings book . She kept on uttering such protests as , " It is terribly personal and I do object to it , " . and waving her long , passionate , worn face from side to side . The Tribunal , and indeed all the men in the court , liked her for her unreasonableness ; and just as she was leaving the witness box one of the three judges , Mr. Russell Vick , thevast silver-haired Mr. Pickwick who used to be a famous footballer , tried to express the sympathy the court felt for her . " I am sure you realize , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wife of a Minister of the Crown --  " and she interrupted him to tell him fiercely that she knew it was a great honor , that two of her most prized possessions were two letters her husband had got from Sir Stafford Cripps praising him for his work , and that was why she hated all this . Mr. Vick waited till she had finished and then continued gently , was only trying to comfort you by saying there are great privileges in being the wife of a Minister of the Crown , and there are great responsibilities , and with this publicity there are great penalties . " She seemed to understand , and when she left the box said to the judges , " Thank you , you have been very kind . " B ur another class of persons involved in this case grew more hateful during each of the twenty-five sessions . These were the civil servants . More and more real crooks came into the case , because a number of subsidiary charges against Ministers and public servants , not so important as the Sherman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but as time went on these seemed not so dangerous to the state as the state itself , whose servants , almost all impudent and incompetent , went into the witness box with the calm of those who never fear dismissal . As they compromised themselves , so they exonerated another class who had seemed , before the inquiry opened , certain to be proved far more blameworthy : the business men who were suspected of having used illicit means to get licenses from government departments . At first sight one put down as a bad old man Sir Maurice Bloch , a whisky distiller from Glasgow , who had supplied Mr. Belcher with large presents of wine and sherry when they were hard to get , in return for licenses to import sherry casks in which to mature his whisky . But when his counsel had placed before the Tribunal the correspondence in which Sir Maurice had besought the Board of Trade to grant him those licenses for two and a half years , it was impossible not to regard him with sympathy . The Board of Trade had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refused those licenses for reasons which were demented . The casks were a free gift from American dealers anxious to handle Sir Maurice 's whisky ; the Board of Trade would not let him import them on the ground that they could not free any dollars to pay for them . When they at last realized that there was nothing to pay for the casks they still refused to grant the license on the ground that this would lower the production cost of Sir Maurice 's whisky and therefore he would lower his price in America and bring in fewer dollars , though the whole point of importing those casks was to enable him to export whisky that otherwise could not be exported at all . It was very hard to feel that Sir Maurice was a really bad man because he had by-passed this imbecility with a few cases of liquor . The Board of Trade official responsible for this correspondence was an attractive young woman with a lovely Scottish voice , which rose unabashed , like the song of a lark , while Sir Maurice 's counsel grimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all were , these civil servants : unabashed . Yet behind every error of Mr. Belcher 's was their inefficiency . One of his worst offenses was the use of his influence in a government department with which he had no concern whatsoever , to get it to grant a license permitting a company owning a hotel to spend twelve thousand dollars on repairing its staff annex . This was very naughty indeed , for the government department had refused the license several times , and Mr. Belcher intervened only because Mr. Stanley asked him to do so . But it was revealed before the Tribunal that the government department 's action in refusing the license had been the fruit of negligence and idiocy . VI T HIS , by God , was England . All of us who sat in court realized that the invisible bonds which bind our country were , by the magic of this peculiar Tribunal , being made visible . It was an odious sight . But what did we do , now that we had seen them ? The answer was , quite simply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Hitler had made us bankrupt . We could not let people import what they fancied from America , we could not let people build as they pleased when there were only so many building laborers and so much building material . If we sacked the Labor government tomorrow , the re-entering Tories could not abolish controls . But how could there be controls without controllers , and how could there be controllers who did not come in the long run , human nature being as beastly as it is , to enjoy the mean pleasure of refusal ? And how , since nobody would take up the dreary job of issuing controls without being given a guarantee of life-long employment , does one prevent controllers from developing the insolence of the secure ? But those outside the court were untroubled by any such crystallization of their country 's problems . The reporting of the Tribunal by the London press was superb , but it naturally laid emphasis on the comic and dramatic aspects of the Inquiry , which indeed never failed to be spectacular in any of its sessions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did nothing to impress on the public that behind these dancing clowns there had been a desecrated shrine . They found that Mr. Gibson and Mr. Belcher had been guilty of misusing their official powers to please Mr. Stanley , and that they had accepted various benefactions from him , although no sums of money seem to have passed ; but they did not draw from the evidence many inferences which most people in court had drawn . This was not unexpected , for during the Inquiry they had time after time failed to pick up clues and ask questions which would have uncovered fresh fields of contest between civic guilt and innocence . This was not because they had pulled their punches for political reasons , though none were members of the Labor party . It was because of the age difficulty which vexes every European country today . They were men of intellect and character but they were middle-aged and did not understand the new world which the war has given us , and the constant demand it makes for bluntness and even brutality of decision . IN THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen how the genius of the state , the continuing executive genius of England , reacted to this misfortune brought on it by this new time . The debates in the House consist for the most part of speeches which are not on a high intellectual level , but they come straight up from the national unconscious ; St. Stephen 's is England 's psychoanalytic couch . The temper of this debate was controlled but deeply troubled . The House was full and so were the galleries ; and the most conspicuous person in the gallery was Mrs. Belcher , who with her long head and her leanness was in agreement with the attenuated and elongated Gothic shapes of the railings and screens and windows . Grief had so consumed her flesh that the skin of her face clung close to her bones , so that she was given a false youth which was astounding and piteous . On the floor of the house , her husband was sitting beside his friend Mr. Haworth , and his appearance was as stricken as his wife 's . He had resigned his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was known that he was opening the debate with a speech which would announce his resignation from the House . It was said that he had been curiously reluctant to take this necessary step . In his terribly used English , Mr. Belcher simply maintained his absolute innocence . " I only say to those who have expressed their faith in me . . . that I wish to assure them that I have not at any time in the course of my official duties been conscious of any deviation from the path of morality and rectitude . " Yet during the Tribunal it had been proved that , quite apart from any matter of corruption , he had been guilty of an action which must in any circumstances terminate the career of a Minister . After the rumors of misconduct were first reported to the Cabinet he had been asked to write a letter to the Lord Chancellor explaining his relations with Mr. Stanley and the Shermans ; and in this he had made the untrue statement that the decision to withdraw the Sherman prosecution had been taken in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor , would have tolerated a member who had told such a flagrant lie on an issue of such importance to it , and Sir Hartley Shawcross and Mr. Attlee and Mr. Morrison and their colleagues were taking only the natural course to defend the Labor government . Mr. Belcher 's failure to realize this ? and it was a genuine failure ; he left the House weeping at his colleagues ' treachery ? showed that , even as he had no sense of any but the primary meanings of words , so he had only the crudest apprehension of conduct . uus disaster had been caused by the invasion could of the not field tell of one power action people who another . That was dreadfully proved later in the debate . An eccentric member , who is brilliant and gallant but whose clock always strikes thirteen at noon , accused Mr. Russell Vick of cruelty because he had spoken to Mrs. Belcher just before she left the box , about the privilege of being wife to a Minister of the Crown . Afterward the Attorney General answered him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which showed that Mr. Vick said these 0 words in a ponderous and deeply felt attempt at soothing an unhappy person . Later in the debate Mr. Blackburn rose to state that Mrs. Belcher had sent down a message to him which declared that she had indeed been greatly disturbed by what Mr. Russell Vick had said to her , and had even been broken down by it , and that she resented personally the Attorney General 's suggestion that she had not . In all my reporting of recent years I have never witnessed an incident more profoundly displeasing : not at Nuremberg , not at the traitors ' trials , not at the lynching trial in South Carolina , not at the Fascist-Communist brawls . It indeed uncovered the root from which all these other hideous episodes grew . Here was being jeopardized was made manifest when Mr. Herbert Morrison rose to close the debate . Here was a man of whom any country should be proud He is fastidious ; he knows that Socialism is so noble a faith that the ignoble can not be tolerated among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hated by Winston Churchill , but he thanked him for taking the line that he and his Tory followers were not to use the debate as an excuse to attack the government but were to discuss the limited difficulty revealed by the Tribunal . He is intelligent . In the preceding speech Sir John Anderson , a great civil servant , had put it to the House that Mr. Belcher 's tragedy might have been averted by stricter adherence to the rules , for he held that it was unconstitutional for the parliamentary secretary of a government department ever to override the decisions of its permanent officials , and that when he and they came into conflict the matter in dispute should be referred to the Minister in charge of the department . Mr. Morrison , himself a superb administrator , enjoyed discussing this point , which has its hearings on the eternal problem of the right relations between the legislature , the political executive , and the administrative staff , which must be debated without remission if government is to be good . It was exhilarating to see two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why the machine had broken down and forgetting everything else in their common feeling that it must not break down again . But Sir John Anderson 's speech was interrupted by cries of dissent , stupid as vomiting , which proceeded from back-bench Labor members who misapprehended it as an attack on democracy instead of a discussion of democratic technique . This was perhaps pardonable , because Sir John Anderson is very far to the right . It was not pardonable when the interruptions broke out again during Mr. Morrison 's speech . As his sensible and sensitive voice carried on through the bawling it appeared that the meaning of the debate and the meaning of the Tribunal were perhaps the same . T HE vastness of the Labor party is a source of weakness as well as strength . The ratio of intelligent to stupid people is such that an increase in party membership , such as it has known during the past few years , adds more and more unco-operative and uninstructed recruits to the rank and file , while not increasing the number of leaders to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the new economy . This is not a plight peculiar to the English Labor party . It might befall any party , in any country . It is a matter of numbers , such as Mr. Harry Sherman would understand . For a time it seemed as if the Labor party might not need to work out its own method of dealing with this disharmony , for the public showed an absorbed interest in the Inquiry , which might have meant that it was shocked by what had gone on under the Labor government and would vote against it at the General Election . But indeed there was no ground for such fear . Both the by-elections which have been fought since the Inquiry have been Labor victories ; it is a safe bet that the voters in the constituency vacated by Mr. Belcher will elect another Labor member to succeed him , and it would be very surprising indeed if the Labor government did not go to its second term . This is a sign both of great weakness and of great strength . Many of the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government which gives them their subsidized food and housing , their free schooling and school meals and medical service , and do not care what the moral complexion of that government may be ; but many other people voted Labor because they belonged to a country which has had as long and as intensive a political education as any in the world , and could estimate the peccancies of Mr. Belcher and Mr. Gibson at their proper value compared to the program and leadership of the Labor party . And the majority also meant that in three months most people have forgotten everything about the Inquiry except Mr. Stanley . THERE never was a clearer disproof of the fallacy that it is forces and not individuals who determine history . England was quite unable to give its attention to the political issues arising out of the Inquiry , simply because it was fascinated by this little creature who lived with the intensity not of a human being but of a major artistic creation such as Falstaff . If Shakespeare himself had attended the inquiry he would have preferred Harry Sherman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold old man , whose intellect was unjust to the world because it was unclothed by the tender opinion of life known as culture , but who was frenzied when he himself was treated unjustly , because this same naked intellect approved the idea of Justice . But Mr. Stanley was meat for the groundlings . While the Tribunal was sitting they laughed at him and his roguery , and now that it is over and the government has said lie must be deported from England , they grieve over him as if his nose were sharp as a pen and a ' babbled of green fields . And indeed his feelings must be nearly as desolate as the dying Falstaff 's , for plainly he loves England , and would not be so happy cheating people anywhere else . Now that both his birthplace Poland and his racial home Israel have rejected him , they pity him deeply , because they know how the little creature longed ( as who does not ) to be a great man , received with honor everywhere ; and they laugh too , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take such a rascal off its hands , and thus he will save himself from the consequences of his rascality by its very grossness . They are also entertained by the calamities that , since the Tribunal , have befallen all the other odd characters summoned by it out of the cracks in the floor . They can not be charged with any offense which was referred to at the Inquiry , for it would be impossible to find a judge or a jury which had not heard of these references and could be considered unprejudiced ; but they are all going into quaint bankruptcy or having unique actions brought against them . It is as if Destiny were shaking the lice out of a vast old coat . In watching them the people were comforted as well as amused , for to see misdoing fail and be comic is to have hope for a minute . Wickedness is the worst thing in the world , and if it is nothing more than this clownish tumbling then the world can not be such a bad place after all .
