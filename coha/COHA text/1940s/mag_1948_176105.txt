The old Stirling " air " engine ( originally patented by Robert and James Stirling of Scotland in 1816 ) was born in the wrong century . Its principle ( power from expanding hot air ) was good , but the crude materials and engineering methods of the time made it too clumsy and inefficient to be widely used . <P> In the current issue of Scientific American , Leonard Engel tells how technological progress has revived the Stirling engines . Just before the war , an engineer of the big and smart Philips electrical company at Eindhoven , in The Netherlands , stumbled on one of the Stirlings . He and his colleagues decided that all it needed was redesigning with modern materials . During the German occupation , they worked quietly to get their mechanical sleeping beauty in shape for the postwar world . <P> The essentials of the air engine are extremely simple : a " hot space " heated by an external firebox , a " cold space " cooled by water or air , and two pistons . When one piston shifts cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushes the second piston away in a power stroke . Then the first piston shunts the air back to the cold space , where it contracts and is ready to start another cycle . A regenerator made of crimped steel wire between the hot &; cold spaces keeps heat from being wasted by the moving air . <P> The Dutch engineers re-created the old engine with stainless steel and aluminum bronze parts where they would do the most good . They improved the regenerator and increased the pressure of the " working " air to 50 atmospheres ( 735 Ibs. per square inch ) at peak . They tinkered hardly at all with the original idea of the 19th Century Scotsmen . When they got through , they had engines that weigh only 10 to 20 Ibs. per horsepower and are about as efficient as diesels . Their simplicity makes them cheap to maintain , and they burn almost any fuel , from oil to coal or corncobs . <P> Since the air engine requires a warming-up period , it is not well adapted to automobiles . The Philips people hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small power plants .
