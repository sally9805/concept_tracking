At this writing the offices of TIME-LIFE International , publishers of TIME Inc. ' s overseas editions , are overwhelmed with requests for copies of a book called How To Do Business Under the Marshall Plan . The roster of names signed to these letters could serve as a Who 's Who of American business , big and small , and the sentiments they express show a genuine desire on the part of private industry to participate wholeheartedly in the Marshall Plan . <P> The story of this important booklet may interest you . It begins with E. K. Gubin , a Washington , D.C. attorney and consultant in governmental law and procedure , who was asked by some of his former San Francisco clients last spring how they were to go about doing business under the Marshall Plan . Gubin 's replies only encouraged these export-importers to ask more questions by return mail . <P> <P> To get the right answers , Gubin began reading the record of the voluminous Congressional hearings on the Economic Cooperation Act . He became so interested in this extraordinary U.S. venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his time to it . To clarify the Act 's many generalities and perplexing statements , he became a constant interrogator at EGA and related government bureaus and at the foreign embassies . In the end , his careful , detailed study became a voluminous report on what the European Recovery Program means to the U.S. businessman ( unlike Lend-Lease , etc. it is to be conducted largely through normal business channels ) , and how he can participate in it . <P> The booklet itself is an education in present-day foreign trade . After telling how the Marshall Plan originated , giving its basic features , administrative setup , and commodity allotments to specific countries , the book carefully explains the role of U.S. business in the Plan and the effect EGA will have on it . Author Gubin devotes 13 pages to an explanation of how foreign missions in the U.S. make their purchases , how to locate foreign buying prospects , methods of payment and the documents required . He tells how to go about selling goods to U.S. Government agencies and even gives a list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Word of mouth created such a demand for Attorney Gubin 's report that he had it printed and sold in booklet form . In it he had written : " Traditional American methods of aggressive salesmanship and advertising in established media reaching European markets may spell the difference between success and failure in your ECA operations . ' ' <P> The importance of world trade and ECA to TIME Inc. is obvious : TLI is founded on the belief that the exchange of news and goods between America and the rest of the world is for the benefit of all concerned , and ( exemplifying that point ) the overseas editions of TIME and LIFE International carry advertising sold separately from TIME Inc. ' s U.S. edition . <P> <P> When TLI had read Mr. Gubin 's book , it thought that it could do everybody concerned a service by distributing it . The author agreed to work with us in updating a second edition , which TLI distributed to some 5,000 U.S. business and industrial leaders . Another 3,000 copies went to Congressman Walter C. Ploeser , chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this important segment of the U.S. economy .
