txt // UNIT IV THE BATHROOM In a survey made of 203 urban areas in the United States by the Works Progress Administration in 1938 it was discovered that 14.6 per cent of the dwellings did not have private indoor flush toilets and that 19.9 per cent did not have private bathtubs and showers . The United States Bureau of Home Economics made a survey of a sampling of farm homes in every state in 1939 and found that nearly 89 per cent of the farm homes lack bathtubs , that in 70 per cent water must be carried in from outdoors and that modern toilet facilities are lacking in 91 per cent of the homes . This indicates that a large percentage of the population in the United States does not have adequate , if any , bathroom facilities . The ideal standard would be one bathroom , and preferably two , for each dwelling . In more elaborate houses a bathroom may be provided for each bedroom , but this is far too expensive a plan for most families . Since the majority of families having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important that this be efficiently planned and equipped if it is to meet the needs of the family . SURVEY QUESTIONS 1 . What would be the advantage in dividing a bathroom into two small rooms with the toilet , or bathtub , in one and the washstand and toilet , or bathtub , in the other ? Describe a bathroom you have seen planned in this manner . 2 . With what built-in features besides the toilet , bathtub , and washstand have you seen bathrooms equipped ? 3 . Have you ever been in a bathroom that you considered too small ? Why did you consider it so ? 4 . Describe the bathroom which you would consider adequate for your family . // Problem I. What Kind of a Floor Plan Is Desirable for the Bathroom ? A bathroom that is to accommodate people occupying several bedrooms should open off the hallway and should not be connected with any room . In the larger house , separate bathrooms may be provided for each bedroom , in which case the bathroom should be connected with the bedroom but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a two-story house , in which is placed a wash basin and a water closet , is called a " lavatory " and is convenient . Often a lavatory is situated under the stairway ; it should never be in a place that is conspicuous from the main entrance of the house . If bedrooms are placed on the first floor of a two-story house , there should be a bathroom on the first floor in addition to the one on the second floor . In a farmhouse it is a convenience to have a washroom for the men on the first floor or in the basement . This should be equipped with wash basins , toilet , and shower bath . If there is a men 's sitting room in the farmhouse , the bathroom or washroom may he connected with it or located off a hallway connecting the two rooms when they are to be on the same floor . A bathroom should never open off the living room , dining room , kitchen , or library . To insure the least expense for plumbing in the two-story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be situated above the kitchen or near enough so that the pipe lines running up one wall can supply the needs for both rooms . A bathroom five by six feet is considered a small bathroom ; one that is six by eight feet is of medium size ; but one larger may be desired . When a bathroom is too large , it requires more time to keep it in order . Shower compartments or stalls are often used in large bathrooms ; in smaller ones the shower may be placed over the tub . The bathroom floor should be easy to clean . Hardwood floors are not desirable in a bathroom because they are easily spotted with water . Tile is considered the best material for flooring a bathroom , but this is expensive . Linoleum over a soft wood floor is less expensive than tile . Linoleum must be securely cemented to the floor so that no moisture can get under it . The quarter round on the baseboard of wood should be removed , the linoleum cemented securely to the floor // under the quarter round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseboards are often used in bathrooms . A sanitary base-board is one in which there are no angles or cracks where water or dirt can collect . Sanitary baseboards are sometimes made of metal in place of wood ; shaped tiles for baseboards are used with tile floors or with tile walls ; sanitary baseboards made of linoleum may be used with linoleum . In a tile floor , a floor drain will make the cleaning of the floor an easy matter . In the most expensive bathrooms the walls are made of tile , or of structural glass . In other bathrooms it is desirable to finish the walls with wainscoting ? a finish extending from the floor four or five feet up the wall . This wainscoting may be made of tile or of Keen 's cement . In old houses sometimes wall board is used , and this can be painted // with enamel paint . Wall linoleum is also used but is more expensive than wall board , though less expensive than tile . Above the wainscoting the wall should be finished with oil paint ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in old houses may be finished with washable wall paper when it is not possible to paint them . The woodwork should be plain in design so that it may be easily cleaned . It is best to finish it with enamel paint , which may be washed without injury . Light colors are preferable for walls and woodwork because the dirt on them will be easily seen , and the bathroom will therefore be cleaned perhaps oftener than when the walls and woodwork are dark ; and by using light colors it is easier to make a bathroom sanitary in appearance . A " medicine case " or cabinet , more often used for toilet articles than for medicine , should be built into the wall of the bathroom , and is usually convenient above the washstand . This case should be supplied with shelves three or four inches deep ; the outside of the door may be finished with a mirror fitted into the framework . Sometimes in a bathroom a towel cupboard is provided . This is built into the wall , frequently with the upper section provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part is finished with drawers . Drawers that are not too deep , the maximum depth being eight to ten inches , will be easier to handle ; they should not be too long or too wide . Sometimes the clothes chute , through which the soiled clothes are passed to the laundry , opens into the bathroom . It may , however , be more convenient when it opens into a hallway . The bathroom in a house should always have outside windows , which will open easily and which are equipped with screens . PROBLEMS AND ACTIVITIES Study the house plans which were collected and mounted and answer these questions : r . What is the size of the largest bathroom ? Of the smallest ? 2 . Is there a lavatory in any of the house plans ? 3 . If there is only one bathroom in the house plan , is it conveniently situated ? 4 . Do any of the bathrooms have built-in cupboards ? A clothes chute ? Select the house plan in which you think the sleeping area is most conveniently arranged and state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What Decoration and Furnishings Are Suitable for the Bathroom ? The windows in a bathroom should be supplied with curtains , made of easily laundered materials . Such materials as India linen , sheer muslin , or Swiss are good to use . When such fabrics as Swiss or muslin are used it is convenient to have two pairs for each window so that there may always be a pair for use while the other is being laundered . Such curtains should be hung on white enamel rods and should hang straight , just touching the window sill . When a shower curtain is needed in the bathroom , the window and shower curtains may be made of the same fabric . Rubberized fabrics are often used for shower curtains and these can be cleaned by wiping them off rather than laundering them . Rag rugs may be used on the floor of the bathroom because these are easily laundered . Cotton chenille rugs are now made for this purpose , but they do not launder as well as the rag rugs . If rag rugs fade with the constant washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the work is done at home . Bath mats of heavy Turkish toweling are designed to protect other rugs or the floor when one steps from a bathtub or shower . These are often kept hanging on a rod near the bathtub . Towel racks may be of glass , of chromium-plated metal , or of porcelain . Such racks should be arranged near the tubs and washstand . The towels and washcloths should be kept hanging straight on the racks ; otherwise the bathroom will always present a cluttered appearance . Soap dishes to hang on the wall or over the side of the bathtub are convenient . In some bathrooms the soap dishes are built into the wall by the washstand and by the bathtub . Each member of the family should keep his or her own soap in the medicine chest or cupboard rather than on or above the washstand . Racks for holding toothbrushes may be hung on the wall , but are not attractive when full of toothbrushes . It is preferable to put toothbrushes in the cupboard when there is one in the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided , and should be placed near the washstand . A glass shelf supported on metal brackets is convenient when placed under the mirror over the washstand . Every bathroom should have // a mirror placed so that it will be at a convenient height for men to use in shaving . A stool , of wood painted to match the woodwork or some other predominating color in the bathroom or one of enameled metal , is a great convenience in a bathroom . There should always be a nickel-plated hook on which to hang the kimono or dressing gown while bathing . Towels for use in the bathroom should include bath towels , face towels , and guest towels . Bath towels are of Turkish toweling , some-times called terry cloth , which is made of cotton yarns so woven that the surface is covered with loops which hold the air and help in drying the body . These towels may be purchased ready-made in several sizes ; they are usually woven with a border on which there are no loops , so that they may be finished with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard and the towels made at home . Decorat ing bath towels with embroidery or crochet work is not the best taste , // because such towels receive hard usage of a kind not suited to such trimming . Colored bath towels are attractive but sometimes fade badly in laundering . Face towels are made of linen or of cotton , or of linen and cotton mixed , the latter being known as " union toweling . " A towel should be soft and should absorb moisture quickly . The best material to meet these requirements is linen ; but linen is expensive , therefore much cotton and union toweling is used . Huckaback is a popular type of toweling for face towels . It may be of linen , cotton , or a union toweling , and is woven so that the surface is rough , which makes it absorb moisture more rapidly . Damask toweling is smooth on its surface , often woven in beautiful patterns , but it does not absorb moisture as quickly as huckaback toweling . Damask and huckaback towels may be purchased ready-made , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Plain hems on the ends of these towels make the best finish for everyday use . Decorated towels are fit for occasional use only , and the decoration should in no way interfere with the use of the towel . Guest towels are narrow , short towels to be used only once , and are primarily designed to meet the needs of guests . They are made of both huckaback and damask toweling . " Finger " towels are smaller than guest towels and are often used in place of guest towels . Either huckaback or damask toweling is to be preferred to crash toweling for face towels , but crash towelings in the lighter weights are used for hand towels . Crash toweling is a coarse , plain-weave toweling , and may be all linen , all cotton , or union . A sufficient number of towels should be supplied so that each member of the family may have his or her towel . Clean towels should be furnished often ; then the towels will not become so soiled that hard rubbing will be required in laundering them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should . The following is a suggested list of the number of towels required : 3 to 6 bath towels per person 3 washcloths per person 6 face towels per person 2 bath mats 6 to 12 guest or finger towels , depending on the frequency of visits from guests . // Wash cloths are often made of Turkish toweling . They should be firmly finished around the edges so that they will not ravel out in laundering . Knitted and crocheted washcloths are also used . Toilet-paper holders are made to hold either rolls of paper or sheets of paper . The chromium plated or enameled holders are attractive . Sometimes toilet-paper holders are built into the wall . In buying toilet paper it is usually less expensive to buy a dozen or more rolls or packages at one time than to buy them singly . PROBLEMS AND ACTIVITIES A study should be made of the various types of toweling , using one-fourth / or one-half-yard samples . Answer the following questions : r . What is the price per yard of linen huckaback toweling ? Crash ? Damask ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 3 . What is the price of a pair of ready-made linen huckaback towels ? How much toweling was required for making these towels ? Compare the price of ready-made and homemade huckaback towels . 4 . Why should each member of the family use his or her own towel ? 3 . What is the price of a good bath towel ? 1 ) o bath towels vary in size ? Using the suggested list of towels needed per person , make a list of the towels needed by a family of five and find the cost of the total list . Practice in laundering towels may be given , especially if there is a school laundry where ironers and other conveniences are available . Problem 3 . How Shall the Plumbing Be Arranged ? At the present time bathrooms may be kept attractive , clean , and free from offensive odors when well-made plumbing fixtures connected with the proper sewage system are installed in a house . The plumbing fixtures for the bathroom of the house of moderate cost include the bathtub , perhaps with a shower attachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best bathtubs are made of porcelain , but are seldom used in a house of moderate cost because this is the most expensive material from which plumbing fixtures are made . Porcelain enamel on either cast iron or pressed steel is less expensive and entirely satisfactory . // Colored bathroom fixtures are more expensive than white but are very attractive . The best design of bathtub is one which is made to set flat on the floor in a corner or against a wall , with a close joint , so that there is no chance of dirt getting underneath or behind the tub . Bathtubs vary in length from four and a half to six feet . Some bathtubs are square in shape . A showerbath attachment is a convenience and does not add greatly to the expense of the tub . Perhaps a sepa rate shower stall will be arranged . Washstands are made of the same materials that are used for bath-tubs , and are designed to fit in a corner , to hang on the wall , or to stand on a pedestal or legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the bathtubs or washstand , but these are expensive and first-quality nickel is more commonly chosen . Washstands and tubs must be equipped with drain and overflow openings , both connected with the waste pipe . 8o THE HOUSE AND ITS CARE The waste pipe from the washstand or bathtub is always provided with some form of " trap , " which is necessary to prevent air from the sewer from entering the room , since this air is charged with disagree-able odors . Traps are made in several forms , probably the most familiar one being the S trap . The best type of S trap is one made with a screw-plug which can be taken out when the trap needs cleaning . Water always stands in the trap , thus preventing odors from passing through to the house . Each washstand and tub should be supplied with a " shut-off , " which is used to shut off the water from the fixtures in case of leakage or other trouble . Water closets are made in many styles to suit the conditions under which they are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses are of three general types : namely , the washout closet , the wash-down closet , and the siphon-jet closet , the name indicating THE BATHROOM 8r the method of washing out or " flushing " the closet . The siphon-jet closet is now considered the most satisfactory because it washes out the bowl in the best manner , the water pass-ing down the sides of the bowl while another stream is discharged through the outlet . The water closet depends for its action on the flush tank , which is a tank automatically filled with water ; when the large volume of water is suddenly discharged into the sewer it carries with it the contents of the bowl . This tank is ordinarily placed just above and back of the seat of the water closet , although some of the older designs have the tank placed high above on the wall . The low tank is preferable because it is more acces-sible , is more easily kept clean , and is better adapted to a room with a low ceiling . The material which passes from the water closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a house , known as the " sewage , " must be disposed of in some way so that there is no odor and no danger of disease resulting from bacteria that might develop with improper care . The best method of disposal is to have the sewage pass from the house into a community sewage-disposal plant , which is the system used in cities and towns . // In the country it is usually necessary to have a sewage-disposal system for each farm . The best method for the single house is to pass the sewage into a septic tank . Formerly cesspools were common , but the cesspool is rapidly being replaced by the septic tank . The septic tank is placed in the ground outside the house ; it is of concrete and is box-shaped , with two compartments , the size being determined by the number of people living in the house with which it is connected . The sewage passes into the septic tank , where it is changed into liquid form through bacterial action , this liquid then passing from the tank . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not purified // even though in liquid form . The liquid may be utilized for surface irrigation in a garden or field , passing through ditches arranged for the purpose ; or it may be employed for subsoil irrigation , when it passes into drain pipes having open joints , placed below the surface of the ground . The latter method is practicable only in porous soils . Sometimes the liquid is disposed of by letting it flow into a running stream of water . The septic tank must be cleaned every six months ; when building it , a manhole opening is constructed partly over each of the two compartments , so that the work may be done without difficulty . A cesspool is made by building a well-like cistern lined with wood or stone , with an open sandy bottom through which the liquid material passes , leaving the solid waste behind to purify itself by its own bacterial action . The cesspool is apt to become a constant source of contamination to the water supply ; it also becomes a nuisance by overflowing when the soil in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cesspool has been universally condemned by health authorities and is not now often installed . When a house is not equipped with a water and sewage system , human waste must be disposed of in the earth closet or privy . At best , a privy is undesirable , and only by constant and intelligent care can it be kept in a condition fit for use . In building a country home , it is therefore always desirable to equip the house with water and sewagedisposal systems . PROBLEMS AND ACTIVITIES Visit a plumbing shop when possible and study the various types of fixtures . If this is not possible , study pictures from plumbing catalogues . Compare the price of white porcelain enamel and colored bathtubs ; of washstands of different types . Discuss the following questions in class : r . From the magazines make a list of manufacturers of plumbing fixtures who advertise their products extensively . Are these products sold in your local shops ? 2 . Among your house plans can you find one where one set of water and waste pipes supplies bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable ? 3 . Is it a good plan to place the bathroom over or near the front entrance to the house ? Why ? // 4 . If " shut-offs " are not supplied on plumbing fixtures , what must be done in case of leakage or other trouble before repair work can be done ? 5 . What materials were used in making bathtubs before enameled iron came into use ? Problem 4 . What Care Should the Bathroom Receive ? A sanitary bathroom should be well ventilated and kept very clean . The window in the bathroom should be screened , preferably with a full-length screen , and the window should be kept open whenever the weather permits . During cold weather it should be opened a short time each morning , but care must be taken not to leave it too long or there may be trouble from the freezing of water pipes . The bathroom needs daily care as well as a thorough cleaning each week . Every morning a linoleum-covered floor should be dusted with a dry mop ; a tile or cement floor should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to have the carpet sweeper run over it , which is a better method of cleaning a small rug than by shaking it ; the shaking is apt to cause the corners or edges to f ray . A porcelain enamel or porcelain washstand should be washed thoroughly with soap and water . If yellow stains appear on the bowl , which may be caused by leaky faucets or by water which has iron in it , they may be removed by rubbing with lemon juice or vinegar . This method may fail with an old stain , in which case dilute oxalic or hydrochloric acid may be effective . Apply the acid with a wad of soft paper , then wash the bowl immediately with soapy water and rinse thoroughly . The bathtub should be cleaned in the same way as the washstand . Nickel or chromium-plated faucets should be washed with soap and water , rinsed , and then wiped dry . When faucets leak , they should be repaired before the drip from them stains the bowl or tub . The shutoff in the pipe leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed . If the pipe is not equipped with such a shut-off , then the water supply for the house must be turned off . A faucet leaks because the leather or rubber washer placed at the end of the screw inside the faucet does not fit the opening through which the water flows ; such a faucet should be repaired by replacing the old washer with a new one . // The water closet should be flushed with clean water ; the trap should be cleaned with a bent-handled brush known as a " trap brush . " The water closet should be washed inside and out with clean soapy water . Occasionally use some of the powders made for use in the water closet , letting them stand in the bowl as directed ; then flush the closet thoroughly . Drinking glasses and soap dishes should be washed carefully each day . Soiled towels and washcloths should be removed from the bathroom and taken to the laundry room , or , when dry , placed in the clothes hamper . Each week the bathroom should be cleaned thoroughly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good plan occasionally to wash painted walls . Enamel-painted walls can be washed with warm soapy water , rinsed , and wiped dry with clean cloths . Change the water often and use plenty of clean cloths in doing the work . Dull-finished paint is harder to clean than enamel paint . Soda or washing powders and yellow soaps will cut the grease quickly , but will cause white paint to become yellow and may change the color of other paints . To wash such walls , use warm soapy water made with a mild white soap ; wash up and down on the wall , making sure that the strokes overlap each other so that there will be no streaks . Wash only a small section of the wall ; then rinse with clean water and wipe dry . Very dirty dull-painted walls may be cleaned with whiting applied with a cloth moistened with warm water . Never use scouring powder on such walls . The woodwork , when finished with enamel paint , can be cleaned in the same manner as the enamel-painted walls . To clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied with a flannel cloth , polishing with a clean flannel cloth . Tile used for walls in a bathroom is usually glazed tile , and may be cleaned by washing with warm soapy water . Floor tile is not so highly glazed and is harder to clean . Use strong soapsuds for floor tile , and scrub thoroughly with a brush ; rinse , and wipe with a dry cloth . Linoleum-covered floors should be wiped with clear warm water . Do not use scouring powders on them . Linoleum is usually varnished and waxed after it is laid , to prevent dirt from getting into the pores of the surface . It should be washed only when absolutely necessary . // Linoleum should be waxed often enough to prevent the varnish from cracking . Hardwood floors must be waxed often in a bathroom . Hardwood is not a desirable flooring , because it spots with water . The windows in the bathroom should be washed each week . Cur tains should be changed often , since they should always be fresh and clean . Mirrors should be washed once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupboard shelves should be kept in order . The best finish for wood shelves is enamel paint , which makes it possible to wash them easily . Glass shelves are often used in cupboards in which toilet articles are kept . If there is a cupboard in the bathroom , a supply of toilet paper , soaps , and other necessary articles may be kept there . Rag or chenille rugs in the bathroom should be washed often . It is desirable to have two sets , so that they may be changed without in-convenience . The amount of care required to keep a bathroom clean depends on the number of people using it and upon the care each person takes in putting things in order when leaving the room . Towels and wash-cloths should always be hung straight , toilet articles put into place , and the tub or washbowl rinsed out thoroughly by each person using it . Clothing should never be left in the bathroom , but should be removed to the owner 's room . If each member of the household will exercise thought in using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PROBLEMS AND ACTIVITIES If there is a Home Management House or Apartment , each step in caring for the bathroom may be demonstrated . If not , each student should do the work at home , reporting on her success and the time used . If there is a laundry , practice in washing rag rugs may be given . Perhaps a rug can be dyed to illustrate the process . // UNIT V THE KITCHEN The kitchen is one of the workrooms in the house . In planning the kitchen always think about the work to be done in it , then plan efficient and adequate space for each activity . For example , when meals are served in the kitchen , more floor space will be needed in the kitchen than would be necessary if only the meal preparation took place there . Or if there must be space in which to place the baby 's // play pen , then floor area must be provided for this need . The modern kitchen should be planned to save as many steps as possible for the housekeeper ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be designed and finished so that it can easily be kept clean . The old-fashioned kitchen equipped with a fireplace , which was workroom , sewing room , laundry and living room , is a thing of the past . We enjoy visiting these old kitchens that have been preserved , but no modern woman would like to work in one of them . SURVEY QUESTIONS 1 . Make a list of all of the activities that are carried on in your kitchen at home . Compare this list with a list of the activities which the women in Colonial times carried on in their kitchens . 2 . Make a list of all the features which you consider make a kitchen a convenient place to work . 3 . How may water be supplied to the kitchen where there is no water system and one does not want to carry water from a pump outside the house ? 4 . Describe the kitchen which you think is the most attractive one you ever saw . What features made it so ? Problem I. What Kind of Floor Plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a small room with equipment compactly arranged , in which the homemaker may do her work with as little expenditure of time and energy as possible . For the house of average size a kitchen nine by eleven , eleven by eleven , or ten by twelve feet is large enough . A kitchen in a farmhouse , where coal or wood is used for fuel , needs to be larger than a kitchen where gas or electricity is used , because ( r ) there must be a place supplied for fuel storage , and ( 2 ) the amount of heat from such a range makes it inadvisable to place other furniture too close to it . The best location for the kitchen in the house plan is in a corner , so that there are two outer walls for light and air . The best exposure is toward the northeast or northwest , or , when there is only one outer wall , toward the north . Through this arrangement it is possible to have a cooler kitchen with less glare from sunlight . // Apartment kitchens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is a very small kitchen often used in apartments ; a " wall kitchen " is a closet in which the sink , refrigerator , stove , work space and cupboards are along one wall in a space six or eight feet in length , closed from view by a single or double door . These wall kitchens are often placed in a wall of the living room of a one or two-room apartment . A kitchen in a house should be supplied with windows enough so that there will be adequate light on all working surfaces and good cross ventilation . Windows placed forty-two to forty-six inches from the floor , and reaching to within a foot or less of the ceiling , will be most convenient , because the wall space below the windows can be utilized for work tables ; also , by having the windows reach near the ceiling it is possible to ventilate the upper part of the room by lowering the upper sash of a double-hung ( with two sashes ) window . When more than one window is placed in a wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " batteries " with no wall space between . Double-hung kitchen windows should have full-length screens , so that they may be opened either at the top or at the bottom , as is most convenient . Casement windows should open out , not in , in a kitchen , so that they will not interfere with the placement and use of equipment . Not more than two doors should open from the kitchen and all doors should be placed on one wall or near a corner of the room . This will make the arrangement of built-in equipment an easier matter . Pantries may be used in connection with a kitchen in a large house . There are two types : ( I ) the food-storage pantry , and ( 2 ) the pass pantry . The food-storage pantry or storeroom is only needed when quantities of foods must be stored . A pantry of this kind should not be a place for storing pots , pans , and kettles , since this means extra steps in carrying such equipment to and from the places where it is used . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is arranged between the dining room and the kitchen , and is a place for storing dishes , for serving , and for separating the two rooms so that noise and odors do not reach the dining room . A pass pantry is a great convenience , but is omitted in the small house because of the expense and the need for the space in other rooms . Doors leading into the pass pantry // from both the kitchen and the dining room should be double-swinging doors , and should be placed diagonally opposite each other ; by such an arrangement the doors do not interfere with each other in swinging , even when the pantry is narrow , and the noise and odors are more completely cut off from the dining room . A pantry is preferably placed on an outside wall so that there may be a window in it . The north exposure is ideal for the pantry , because in such a position it may be kept cooler . A screened porch opening from the kitchen is a convenience in warm weather . If such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during hot weather . In the country , this is a very desirable plan , especially when helpers on the farm must be supplied with meals during certain months . Artificial lighting must be carefully arranged in the kitchen . The best method of lighting a kitchen by electricity is by the " semiindirect " method , in which the light bulb is enclosed in a translucent bowl , fastened at the ceiling . This type of fixture furnishes adequate general lighting but over the sink , the work table , and the stove it is well to plan for additional ceiling lights , or drop lights hanging from the ceiling above the head of the worker , especially when the kitchen is large . Lights on the under side of cupboards are out of sight of the worker and furnish good light without glare on work surfaces . These are called " soffit " lights . Pantries should be well lighted ; semi-direct lighting in a pass pantry is desirable . Floors in a kitchen may be ( I ) of hard wood , ( 2 ) covered with linoleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of composition flooring , and ( 4 ) of cement or tile . Wood is not desirable , because it requires too much attention to keep it in good order . The best woods to use for this purpose are beech or maple . They should be saturated with hot linseed oil so that grease will not be absorbed if dropped on them . Linoleum is a very good covering for the kitchen floor . There are two kinds of figured linoleum which may be purchased : printed and inlaid . Printed linoleum has the figure only on the surface , and with wear the color and design disappear , unless the linoleum is protected with varnish or linoleum paint . Inlaid linoleum is made with the colors and design extending through to the back of the linoleum , so that the design can not wear off . A third kind of linoleum is plain linoleum , which is a solid color without any design . One very heavy // and desirable variety of plain linoleum is called " battleship " linoleum . This type is often used in hospitals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material composed of ground cork and oxidized linseed oil mixed to a plastic mass and applied with pressure to a prepared burlap backing . It can be purchased in various widths , some wide enough to reach entirely across the floors to be covered . When two strips must be joined , the edges should be fastened together with a cement made for the purpose . It is best to have an experienced man , from the store where the linoleum is purchased , lay the linoleum , since it must be done correctly or the linoleum may not lie smoothly on the floor . When a wood baseboard is used in the kitchen , the same procedure should be followed as is described for bathrooms . ( See page 72 . ) The linoleum should be laid so that no moisture can get under it when the floor is mopped , since linoleum is a nonconductor . Water will not dry out quickly when under it , and may spoil the burlap backing of the linoleum . In many modern kitchens , a sanitary baseboard , instead of wood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a kitchen , a sanitary baseboard is always used . Tile is a sanitary floor covering , but a very hard surface on which to stand or walk . If tile or cement is used , rubber mats should be placed at points on the floor where much standing at work is to be done . Rubber heels or soles on the shoes should also be worn by persons working in such a room to avoid fatigue . Rubber flooring is not recommended for kitchens because it absorbs grease , but manufacturers are finding better ways to finish it and if an impervious finish is discovered , rubber floors should become popular for kitchens . Woodwork in a kitchen should be very plain , without grooves or angles in which dust and dirt may collect . Light-colored enamel paint is the best finish for woodwork . Stained or varnished wood is not desirable , and even when such finish is used in the rest of the house , it is preferable to have the painted wood in the kitchen . Walls in a kitchen are best when finished with light-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greens , buffs , or ivory are good colors to select . A light-colored wall makes the room much lighter , because it reflects the light . Painted walls may be cleaned by the same method as that used for bathroom walls . When walls must // be papered , as in an old house , the washable wallpapers should be used . Sometimes a wainscoting of tile or tile-like product is used in a kitchen . This is very sanitary , but expensive . " Keen 's " cement is sometimes used for a wainscoting and is finished with enamel paint . Wood is not desirable for this purpose . In elaborate kitchens , the walls may be made entirely of tile or of structural glass . A well-planned and finished kitchen becomes a pleasant place to work in as well as a workshop where little time and energy need be wasted . " PROBLEMS AND ACTIVITIES What kinds of wire screening may be used for making window screens ? Which type is the best ? The most expensive ? Are wooden or metal frames preferable for window screens ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ? Discuss good methods for hanging window screens . How should screens be arranged on casement windows ? Examine various kinds of linoleum . What is the price of good inlaid linoleum ? How would you determine the quantity needed for covering the kitchen floor ? Use color cards and select colors that would be suitable for kitchen walls . Which colors are preferable for a very sunny , light room ? For a dark kitchen ? Examine samples of washable wallpapers . What is one brand advertised very extensively ? Discuss colors and designs suitable for kitchen walls . Problem 2 . What Built-in Devices Are Needed in the Kitchen ? The sink for the kitchen may be made of porcelain , porcelain enamel , monel metal , or of stainless steel . The one-piece sink is best . ) This sink has the splash back , sink and drain boards cast in one piece , which means there will be no crevices or cracks where dust and dirt can collect . Large sinks , not built into cabinets or work surfaces , are usually supplied with legs at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is desirable to have them hung on the wall . If piping can come through the wall rather than through the floor , and the sink can be hung on the wall , it is much easier to clean under the sink ; and when linoleum is used , less cutting and fitting of the linoleum around the pipes is required . The sink of usual height ( thirty-two inches to // the top of the rim of the sink ) is too low for many housekeepers . The sink should be raised to such a level that it is convenient for the person using it ? thirty-four to thirty-six inches from the floor is a good average height . " Cabinet " sinks built with cupboards below the sink , finished as one unit , are often used in kitchens where the sink is not built into the work surface of " units " purchased for a kitchen . These units for kitchens are made of wood , or of metal , and come in various styles and kinds . The units needed may be selected , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same factory . The ones selected are then fitted onto the kitchen walls and form a continuous large unit with no joins showing . If there is a work surface to go on top // of a series of units , this is installed last and is in one piece . The cupboards to hang on the wall may extend to the ceiling , but when this is not desirable the space between the cupboard top and the ceiling should be sealed up with the wall finish . In most kitchens , the cupboards can extend to the ceiling , using the upper sections for holding equipment used only occasionally . A cupboard shelf should be only deep enough to hold one or two rows of articles . This eliminates the necessity for moving several articles in front of the one desired . Shelves will , therefore , vary in width from six or eight inches to twelve or fourteen inches . There should never be waste space between shelves ; a shelf should be just high enough to hold the articles to be placed upon it . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may be adjusted to different heights , this will be found convenient . Cupboards should be finished with doors of as plain design as possible . Glass in cupboard doors requires additional work in cleaning and should not be used . In planning a kitchen it is always an economical plan to make the kitchen a size that will take units of standard sizes . To make especially // designed units is expensive and adds to the cost of building . In remodeling old houses often the cupboards and cabinets must be especially built in order to fit into the space in the kitchen . Wood cupboards and cabinets may be designed and built by firms doing mill work when the commercially made units for kitchens can not be used . A CABINET SINK IN A U-SHAPED KITCHEN Shelves in wood cupboards , both top and bottom , should be finished with enamel paint of a light color ; there is then no necessity for using paper on the shelves and the shelves may be washed easily . The light paint is best because the dirt shows more quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding certain articles , such as towels or aprons , will be needed , and may be built into the lower part of the cupboards . Drawers should never be too deep or too long and wide , since this makes them hard to manipulate . The inside of cup-board drawers may be finished in the same manner as cupboard shelves . The built-in cabinet or work table should be placed where there is a good light falling on the work surface , and should be so designed that it is a convenient height at which to work for the housekeeper when // sitting on a stool . It is desirable to have an open space under one section , so that it is possible to sit comfortably while at work . Below the work surface , bins for holding flour and sugar may be built . These bins should tilt forward easily ; they should not be too large , because of the difficulty in handling . Wood bins should be lined with metal and should be so constructed that the lining can be taken out for cleaning . Shallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should be placed in the work cabinet in such a position that it is easy to utilize them for holding knives , spoons , and other small equipment necessary for the ' preparation of food . Such drawers are convenient when divided into compartments for each group of articles . Twenty-two inches is considered the maximum width for a work surface when there is a cupboard above it . The bottom of the cupboard should be fourteen to sixteen inches above the work surface . Work surfaces in kitchens may be of wood , or may be covered with metals such as monel or stainless steel , or with linoleum sealed down to the wood top . When wood is used , it should be finished with linseed oil or oil stain , which fills the pores in the wood and makes it easier to clean . Drop shelves may be found convenient when extra serving is to be done . In a pass pantry , there should always be plenty of work surfaces to be used in serving meals . The iced refrigerator should preferably be connected with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sewer . In connecting the refrigerator to the drain , there should be a water trap which prevents sewer gas from entering the house . If an electric refrigerator is used there must be an electric outlet to which the refrigerator may be attached . In homes where no refrigerator is used , a dumbwaiter connected with the basement is a great convenience . Such a dumb-waiter should be screened to protect it from flies . In some sections of the country " iceless refrigerators " are practicable . This device is constructed of a framework covered with wire netting and provided with shelves on which the food is placed . Over the outside of this food closet are hung curtains of Canton flannel buttoned tightly around the frame , with ends extending into a pan or pail of water . The curtains are kept moist by this arrangement , and upon the evaporation of this moisture the food closet is cooled . // Such a box must be placed where there is a free circulation of air , which causes rapid evaporation of the water . PROBLEMS AND ACTIVITIES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other store selling plumbing fixtures and find out about the prices of kitchen sinks . How much more expensive is a colored than a white sink ? What is the price of a cabinet sink ? Do any of the sinks have " mixing faucets " on them ? Why are these convenient ? Do any of them have spray attachments ? Are these worth the additional price charged for them ? Problem 3 . How Should This Built-in Equipment Be Arranged in the Floor Plan ? Every well-planned kitchen should be equipped with cupboards , sink , and work tables or cabinets , preferably built-in so that there will // be no necessity for moving them about to clean underneath or behind them , as must be done with movable cabinets or cupboards . This equipment should be carefully planned by the housekeeper , because the design and arrangement must be correct or work in the kitchen can not be done conveniently . There are several plans of arrangement which may be followed depending on the shape and arrangement of the kitchen floor plan . One plan is known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too THE HOUSE AND ITS CARE in a continuous line or three walls of the room , with the refrigerator at the right of the work table or space , the sink at the left of this workspace , with a second workspace at the left of the sink , and the stove at the left of this second workspace . It is convenient to have serving space at the left of the stove , this serving space to be near the dining room door . The refrigerator should be near the outside entrance . ( See drawing I. ) The U arrangement gives the most efficient working space for one worker providing the kitchen is not more than nine or ten feet in width and the U is arranged with the sink on the end of the room . A second plan is called the L plan in which the equipment is arranged in the same sequence but is placed on only two adjoining walls of the room . This plan is good to use in large kitchens and when part of the kitchen is used , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . ( Drawing 2 . ) The third plan of arrangement is the " corridor " plan , which is necessary whhii doors are on opposite ends of a narrow room . Then the , work in , the kitchen divides itself into : ( T ) the center in which the THE KITCHEN IOI food is prepared , cooked , and served , sometimes called the " prepara-tion center " ; ( 2 ) the center in which dishes are washed and put away , sometimes called the " cleaning-up center . " In the preparation center , it is necessary to have the refrigerator and the supply cupboard at the left of the work table or cabinet and the stove , and the serving table or tray at the right of the work space ; in the cleaning-up center should be found a stack space for dishes at the right of the sink , the sink , and the dish cupboards at the left of the sink . ( Drawing 3 . ) Small equipment must be stored where it is most frequently used ; for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation of food should be stored at the place used for preparation . When the table dishes are to be put away in the pantry , it is desirable to have an opening through the wall between the kitchen and the pass pantry with a shelf on which the dishes may be placed , thus eliminating the carrying of clean dishes into the pantry . If there is no arrangement of this kind , the clean dishes should be placed on a wheel tray and carried into the pantry all at once , so that as many steps as possible may be saved . All adjoining work surfaces in the kitchen should be the same height . // This prevents the necessity of lifting articles from one height to another , which causes waste of energy and sometimes breakage of dishes . In some homes meals are regularly served in the kitchen and the floor space must be large enough for a table and chairs . When possible , without spoiling the work arrangement , the dining table should be placed near a window . PROBLEMS AND ACTIVITIES Select a kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one-half inch scale and place in it the following equipment , drawing to scale : sink , stove , built-in cabinets , cupboards , refrigerator . Is the kitchen best arranged with the U , the L or the corridor plan ? Why ? Study the catalogues from companies making kitchen " units . " Select the units you would like in the above kitchen . Do they fit into the wall space ? // Problem 4 . What Kitchen Equipment Is Needed ? The amount and kind of equipment needed in any kitchen must be determined by the housekeeper after she has considered carefully the needs for doing her work . All the labor-saving devices which she can afford to buy , and which can be of assistance in doing the work in the easiest , quickest , and best manner , should be included in the list . Many devices sold as labor-saving devices are not so constructed that they can be used successfully and therefore are not worth buying . A very good type of labor-saving device may not be a necessity , because the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require as much time as is needed to clean and keep the appliance in order . In purchasing kitchen utensils , the housekeeper should keep in mind the following points : ( I ) Is the device so constructed that it can be easily cleaned ? ( 2 ) Is it made of good material , well designed and finished ? ( 3 ) Is it the proper size ? ( 4 ) Is the price in proportion to the length of time the article can be used and the need for it ? A kitchen should not be overstocked with utensils , since this means that the housekeeper must care for much equipment seldom used . It is essential , however , that there shall be an adequate amount of equip ment well selected and arranged if work is to be done with the least expenditure of energy and time . Kitchen utensils may be classified into four groups : ( I ) those used in the preparation of food ; ( 2 ) those used in the cooking and serving of food ; ( 3 ) those used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laneous ways . On the next page is a suggested list of those belonging in each group . // 1 // The kind of material from which the utensil is constructed has much to do with its efficiency . Kitchen utensils are made of aluminum , stainless steel , copper , iron , tin , earthenware , g1ss , semi-vitreous china , enameled steel , and wood . Cutlery of the best quality is made of high carbon steel because this Io6 THE HOUSE AND ITS CARE is a hard steel and a knife made of this will hold a good edge . The handle of a knife should be comfortable to hold , should be smooth , and the blade should be riveted to the handle . Handles for knives are made of wood , metals , and synthetic materials . The number and kinds of knives needed in the kitchen will depend upon the kinds of work // done , but in every kitchen paring knives , butcher knives , a bread knife , a slicing knife , and spatulas will be needed . Forks used in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tines should be strong , should have sharp points and the handles should be securely riveted to the metal . Spoons are made of aluminum , tin , iron , stainless steel , enamelware , and wood . Wood spoons are used for stirring hot foods on the stove because the handles do not become heated . They are also desirable to use for beating and stirring because they do not mar the bowls or pans with which they are used . Utensils used in cooking on top of the stove may be of aluminum , stainless steel , iron , enamelware , or heatproof glass . Aluminum pans may discolor when certain foods are cooked in them . At the present time , aluminum utensils are being made that are especially treated so that they do not stain . Aluminum utensils wear well . Enamelware may chip on the edges but the better grades are attractive and come in various colors that make it possible to carry out a color scheme in the kitchen . An acid-proof finish is desirable on bright-colored enamelware . A pan with a black or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame , or top unit , of the stove is best because it is most economical in heat use . Saucepans or kettles for the electric stove must be of this type . Handles on saucepans must not be too long because they may be in the way or may overbalance the pan . The handle of a saucepan must be securely fastened to the pan in such a way that there is a smooth join and so that there are no hollow places where dirt may collect . Wood , hollow metal , or such materials as Bakelite are used for handles on saucepans . Bails should be used on large utensils since it is easier to lift a heavy kettle with a bail than with a handle . Utensils used for baking are commonly made of aluminum , tin , iron , enamelware , china , heatproof glass , earthenware . For long cooking processes in the oven use the heavy-weight materials such as earthenware and glass while for quick baking the light-weight materials such as aluminum or tin are satisfactory . Casseroles and ramekins are made of earthenware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them may be served in the same dishes at the table . Iron , glass , aluminum and stainless steel are used in making griddles and skillets ; kettles , frying kettles , and waffle irons to use on the stove are made of iron . Tinware is good for dishpans , colanders , measuring cups , pie pans , cake pans , cutters ; wireware is used for drainers , bread and cake racks , frying baskets , and egg whips ; wood is used for chopping bowls , rolling pins , spoons , bread boards , and towel racks . Japanned ware is used in making bread and cake boxes , dustpans , trays , and crumb trays ; this is made of tin covered with a hard coating of colored varnish , called " japan " because the articles coated in this way resemble the celebrated lacquered ware from Japan and China . Each utensil for the kitchen should be of the right size ; for example , a double boiler holding a pint would not be of sufficient size for preparing breakfast food for a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two it would be large enough . Every utensil should be examined for grooves and crevices , since the more of these places there are in which food may collect , the harder the utensil will be to clean . The best grades of utensils are usually well constructed ; therefore it pays to get those higher in price when possible . The lip on the utensil should be properly placed , so that it is of use in pouring . Lips on opposite sides make it convenient to pour with either hand . The construction of a complicated device should be thoroughly understood , and directions for its use and care should be carefully followed . Many labor-saving appliances of the more elaborate type do not operate successfully because the housekeeper will not spend time to learn to use them properly . A wheel tray for the kitchen should be on four wheels and narrow enough so that it goes through doors easily . One equipped with two or three good-sized trays , a drawer , and possibly a towel rack , is a good type . A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trays . A kitchen table on castors , small enough to move about , may be used in a kitchen when floor space will permit , provided additional table space is needed . Dishwashers operated by electricity are now being installed in some homes where large numbers of dishes are to be washed . In small families such a device is a convenience when dishes are only washed // once a day . Some sinks are built with a dishwasher already attached . Electric garbage grinders , which grind up the garbage fine enough to pass through the sink drain , are sometimes attached to sinks . When equipping a kitchen it is a wise plan to make a list of the articles desired ; then to make a trip to a large hardware store where utensils may be compared and new appliances studied before the outfit is purchased . PROBLEMS AND ACTIVITIES The edges of saucepans and kettles may be ( s ) turned , ( 2 ) rolled , or ( 3 ) rimless . Visit a hardware store and see if you can find saucepans or kettles representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Make lists of the foods that would require long cooking and those that require short cooking in the oven . What kinds of utensils would be best to use for each food when cooking in the oven ? Find the price of each article of good quality listed on pages 104 and io5 . Which articles could be omitted if less than this amount of money were available for equipment ? What are some well-known brands of aluminum ware ? Of glassware used for cooking purposes ? Of enamelware ? Problem 5 . What Kinds of Refrigerators Are Used ? Many people now use " mechanical " refrigerators , which are either electric , gas , or oil refrigerators . There are several points that should be observed when selecting one of these refrigerators . First , is the refrigerator of sufficient size to store the food to be kept in it ? The size of a refrigerator is usually designated by cubic feet , the number meaning the cubic feet of food storage space it contains . One rule sometimes used to determine the size to buy is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each member of the family . Very often the size is determined by the amount of floor space in the kitchen available for the refrigerator . Small refrigerators cost more in proportion to their storage capacity than do larger refrigerators , so it is a wise plan to select one of adequate size . Second , is the refrigerator frame well designed ? The frame of a good rro THE HOUSE AND ITS CARE refrigerator is made of steel treated so that it is rust proof . The outside finish on a good refrigerator is porcelain enamel or lacquer . Third , what kind of lining does a good refrigerator have ? The lining is of metal cast in one piece and should be designed with rounded corners and finished inside with porcelain enamel . The shelves are made of rust-proof metal wire . Fourth , does the door fit tightly ? The door must fit snugly into the frame . It is often finished with a rubber gasket which makes it fit tighter . The latches and hinges on the door are finished with nickel or chromium and should fasten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulated ? This is very important since no refrigerator maintains a desirable temperature of 450 F. to 5o ? F. unless the outside walls are well insulated . The material used in the walls must stay in place , must be heat resistant and odorless . The insulation in a good refrigerator should be not less than two inches in thickness . Since the insulating material can not be seen when buying a refrigerator , it is highly desirable to select one made by a well-known firm with a reputation for making satisfactory mechanical refrigerators . Sixth , what convenient features does the refrigerator have ? There should be enough ice cube trays and freezing trays to meet the needs of the family . There may be a special rack for fruits , a basket for eggs , a " hydrator " in which to store vegetables , and there are electric lights , and other features . All of these add to the cost of the refrigerator and only those needed to make the refrigerator convenient for a particular family should be selected . An electric refrigerator with a section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market . This type would be convenient when frozen foods are brought from a locker plant or purchased at the store and must be kept for several days . Iced refrigerators of good quality must be well insulated to conserve ice and preserve foods satisfactorily . The designs of iced refrigerators are similar to the mechanical ones and should be observed for the same points . When a refrigerator is installed in a home , directions should be given for its care and operation , and these directions should be carefully followed . It is a wise plan to have a service man from the company from which the refrigerator was purchased look after it when anything is out of order . THE KITCHEN I l l PROBLEMS AND ACTIVITIES Examine a refrigerator at home or school and see how the door fastens . Do any of them close by pushing with the arm or knee ? Is this desirable ? What is the price of an electric refrigerator of seven cubic feet capacity ? a gas refrigerator ? an oil refrigerator ? Compare these prices with the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of insulating materials are used in refrigerator walls . Which are considered most desirable ? Why ? Does any local dealer handle a refrigerator with a compartment for keeping frozen foods ? What is the trade name ? By what concern is it manufactured ? When would it be convenient to use such a refrigerator ? Mr. and Mrs. Simpson are going to buy a new electric refrigerator . They have two children , a son i6 years old and a daughter 13 years old . The son , Bob , is very fond of bringing home his friends and always wants ginger ale or other soft drinks in the refrigerator ready to serve to them . The family live in the city and buy only small amounts of foods at a time . They entertain guests for meals every week or two . The whole family drinks milk . twice a day . What size refrigerator should the Simpsons buy ? What special features , or gadgets , might be useful on the refrigerator ? They want to buy a refrigerator costing not-more than $175 . Problem 6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of many types , depending upon the fuel used . Wood , coal , gasoline , kerosene , denatured alcohol , acetylene , manufactured and natural gas , and electricity are all used for cooking . Wood and coal ranges should be selected with as small an amount of nickel on them as it is possible to use ; they should be plain in design and easily operated . Such ranges are ordinarily used where gas or electricity is not available , since coal and wood ranges require much more care in operation . A range may have its oven at table height with the bottom of the oven level with the burners ( called " surface units " ) on the stove and placed at either the left or right of the burners . This is known as the " console " or " conventional " type . Or the oven may be below the burners , either directly below or at the right or left of the burners in what is known as the " table-top " range . The table-top range is convenient when placed between , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work surfaces are all the same height . When a stove stands alone , away from work surfaces , the console type is more convenient since it requires less stooping to use the oven . 1 12 THE HOUSE AND ITS CARE A stove in which coal or wood is burned is usually made of iron or malleable cast iron while gas and electric stove frames are often made of porcelain enamel . Gas and electric stoves are finished in colored as well as white porcelain enamel . Electric stoves are used extensively now . Because of the compara tively high cost of electric cooking it is desirable to conserve heat by using cooking utensils with dull black , flat bottoms as near the size of the surface unit as possible ; by regulating the heat to a lower tem perature after the food begins to boil ; and by using the temperature controls on the oven correctly . Temperature controls may be of two // types : ( I ) one that maintains a uniform temperature throughout the cooking of the food , or ( 2 ) one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat when a certain temperature is reached . Some stoves have " thermal wells " used for long slow cooking processes . Electric stoves may have " convenience outlets " to which electric equipment such as a percolator or toaster may be attached . Electric stoves of good construction give excellent service and where fuel cost permits their use , they are the most satisfactory of all kitchen stoves , because there is little dirt in connection with their operation . Gas stoves must have efficient burners with the flame not too far from the utensil and the burner carefully regulated so that proper combustion of the gas takes place . The company selling the stove usually regulates the burners when the stove is installed in the kitchen but they must be checked occasionally to keep them in proper condition . Ovens on gas stoves should have temperature controls on them . Modern gas and electric ranges may have storage compartments for utensils , condiment sets , clocks , lights and hinged lids to fold down over the surface units when they are not in use . All of these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected the purchaser must consider carefully her need for such features . Gasoline or kerosene ranges are used in homes during summer months when a coal or wood range would make too much heat in the kitchen . Gasoline stoves should be handled with care and should not be used when out of order because gasoline is inflammable . The housekeeper should understand the construction of such a stove and follow the directions given for its operation . Kerosene ranges with built-in ovens are now available . A hot plate is a gas stove composed of two , three , or four burners put together in a framework , which must be set on a table in order to get it at table height . Separate ovens are used with these stoves . Steam cookers , pressure cookers , and electric cookers are all fuel savers and time savers . The steam cooker is constructed so that food is cooked by steam ; the pressure cooker cooks by steam under pressure ; and the electric cooker is constructed to retain heat so that a food will cook with the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cooked all at the same time in any one of these devices . // PROBLEMS AND ACTIVITIES Make a list of the brand names of gas stoves and electric stoves advertised in the magazines . Can you find the brand name of a kerosene stove ? Compare the prices of these stoves . Does any one have " gadgets " that make the stove more expensive yet do not add to its efficiency ? Make a list of the points to be observed about a range when buying one . List some of the ways in which fuel may be saved when cooking with gas . Why should kettles to be used on surface units on an electric stove have dull black bottoms ? Problem 7 . What Care Does the Kitchen Need ? However well a kitchen may be planned , decorated , and furnished , it can not be a sanitary place in which to prepare food unless it is kept clean . The care with which work is done has much to do with the ease of keeping the kitchen in order . If , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it requires more time to finish the work because the floor must be mopped ; if the garbage is wrapped in paper less time is required to keep the garbage can clean . In doing any piece of work in the kitchen , it is a wise plan to experiment with different methods until the one requiring the least amount of time and energy to do the task well has been determined . Many housekeepers never change their methods of doing work , when with some thought and experiment the amount of time required could be greatly shortened . A housekeeper wishes to keep her kitchen in good order , but she is a very poor housekeeper if she spends more time there than is actually required . Washing dishes is one task which must be done in every kitchen . This work should never be termed " drudgery , " and need not be when the housekeeper is supplied with good equipment , plenty of hot water and soap , and uses modern methods . Draining dishes in a wire dish drainer , rather than wiping them , saves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the family is composed of but two or three persons saves time for the homemaker who does all the housekeeping herself . When household helpers are employed , this plan would be impractical . The sink must be cleaned after each meal . It should be washed out with clean soapsuds and rinsed with hot water . A stained porcelain // enamel sink may be scoured with a fine cleaning powder . Monel or stainless steel sinks need only to be cleaned with soap and water . Wood drainboards may be scoured with cleaning powder and a brush when necessary . Faucets of brass may be cleaned with lemon juice or vinegar when badly stained ; nickel or chromium faucets need only be washed with soap and water . The refrigerator should be clean at all times , and once or twice a week it should be thoroughly cleaned . Remove the ice and all food ; remove the shelves and other parts . Wash the inside of the re frigerator , the shelves , and other parts with clean soap-suds , and rinse with clean cold water . Replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical refrigerator must be " de-frosted " when the frost on the cooling unit is about one-fourth inch thick , and this can be done when the refrigerator is cleaned . The garbage can should be cleaned thoroughly at least once each week . If the garbage is wrapped in paper before it is placed in the can , the can need only be washed out carefully with clean hot soapsuds and thoroughly dried ; when garbage is not wrapped , the can must be scrubbed with hot soapsuds every time it is emptied , and occasionally with a strong washing-soda solution . The can should always be tightly covered . Sometimes garbage cans are placed in a cement well in the ground outside the house , which is just large enough to receive the can . The well is closed with a cover operated with a foot lever . The // garbage can must have a bail , so that it can be conveniently lifted from the well . An incinerator is a device in which garbage may be burned . Sometimes an opening to a chute through which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built into the kitchen wall . The garbage is burned in the incinerator with heat applied by means of gas or coal , gas being considered best because of its intense heat . An incinerator is a convenience in a city or town house where the plan for the disposal of garbage is not always adequate . In rural districts , garbage is utilized for feeding purposes , and in such cases it should not be wasted by burning ; it is also best not to wrap garbage in paper under these conditions . Cupboards should be cleaned whenever they need cleaning , regardless of whether it is " house-cleaning time . " If such a rule were followed in regard to all cleaning , no annual or semiannual house cleaning would be needed . If shelves are painted with enamel paint they can be cleaned by washing with clean warm soapsuds , rinsing with clear water , and drying . Supply cupboards can be made much more efficient if dry supplies , such as coffee , rice , spices , and cereals , are placed in containers of glass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labeled so that there need be no difficulty in locating the article required . Work tables and cabinets require daily care and should be cleaned after each using . A coal or wood range should have all the ashes removed each day . The top of the stove should be wiped off first with a newspaper and then with a damp cloth . The stove may be painted with black enamel stove paint , which must be allowed to dry thoroughly , after which it will remain in good condition for some time . Nickel on a stove may be cleaned by polishing with " whiting " moistened with ammonia or water . A range finished in porcelain enamel should be washed with soap and water . A gas , kerosene , or gasoline stove should be so constructed that it may be taken apart for cleaning . The gratings should be washed in soap and water . The inside of ovens should be wiped out and washed when necessary . Cloths used for cleaning stoves should not be used in connection with dishwashing . The floor in a kitchen should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with clean warm soapsuds and rinsed with clear water . // The length of time linoleum will wear may be greatly increased by covering the surface with linoleum varnish or lacquer . In using these , the pores in the linoleum are filled , which protects the surface from the wear and tear due to people walking on it , or moving furniture about . The linoleum varnish or lacquer must be renewed whenever there is any sign of wear on the surface . Linoleum may be waxed with any prepared floor wax , but this is not a desirable finish for a kitchen floor because the wax spots when water drops on it and is allowed to stand a few minutes . Hardwood floors in a kitchen are best finished with a coat of boiled linseed oil , and when cleaned should be wiped with a mop wrung out of warm water . Such floors will need to be oiled occasionally , depending upon the amount of wear on the floor . The windows and woodwork in a kitchen should be cleaned often , the number of times per year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of work done in the kitchen . The walls and woodwork should be cleaned in the manner described on page 85 . The order to be followed in the weekly cleaning of the kitchen should be : I. Clean the stove 2 . Clean the cupboards 3 . Wash or wipe the walls when necessary 4 . Wash or wipe the windows and woodwork when necessary 5 . Clean the work table and sink 6 . Clean the floor 7 . Dust the furniture 8 . Hang the curtains The following are suggested methods for cleaning utensils used in the kitchen : Aluminum should never be scraped with a steel knife ; use a wooden spoon for this purpose .

When aluminum becomes darkened , the stain may be removed by boiling the utensil in an oxalic acid solution made by dissolving two tablespoons of oxalic crystals in one gallon of water ; the kettle must then be washed thoroughly with soap and water , because oxalic acid is poison .

Use a wooden spoon to remove food which has been burned on ; scour with a cleaning powder . Iron must be kept dry to prevent rusting . Rust may be removed by scouring with cleaning powder , washing thoroughly and drying over heat . The cogs on egg beaters should not be dipped into water , since they can not be dried thoroughly and may rust . Steel should be cleaned in the same manner as iron . Knives should be scoured with cleaning powder and a cork . Stainless steel is good for knives , because scouring is unnecessary . Tinware should never be scraped with a steel knife or metal dish cloth . It may be cleaned by scouring with a cleaning powder , and when necessary may be boiled in a solution of washing soda .

Insects and animals which are troublesome about houses are called household pests . They are sometimes destructive and often dangerous , because they carry disease . HOUSE FLIES House flies are one of the most annoying household pests and are a menace to health , because they are disease-carriers . The principal // breeding places of house flies are in stable manure , in decaying garbage , in manure from poultry houses , and in human excrement in privies . One of the best methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places by keeping things clean . Houses should be tightly screened ; especially is this necessary in kitchens and dining rooms . All garbage cans should be kept clean and tightly covered ; food which will attract flies , such as meats and sweets , should be securely covered ; paper in which such food has been wrapped should be burned as soon as possible . When these precautions do not keep flies away from the house , other methods must be employed . Fly traps may be used , or sticky fly paper put where flies will get into it . Spray materials may be sprayed about the room and on screens ; these products mayl be purchased at drug stores or elsewhere and the sprayer may be purchased with the can of spray material . The spray material kills or numbs the flies and they then may be swept up and removed . ANTS Ants are very troublesome in a house , especially the little red ant , which is capable of crawling through very small crevices or cracks . The most effective way of getting rid of ants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lays the eggs . Pouring carbon bisulphide into each of several holes made in the nest with a sharpened stick , covering the holes immediately with earth , is the most effective method of destroying the ants . Carbon bisulphide gas is inflammable , and no form of light or fire should be brought near it . Kerosene may be used instead of the carbon bisulphide . Often it is impossible to find the ant hill or to get at it when it is discovered . In such cases the ants will have to be exterminated by killing them in the house . Sponges soaked in sweetened water and placed in the part of the house where the ants are found in the greatest numbers will attract them . When they have crawled into it , the sponge should be dropped into boiling water . Sponges may be soaked in a syrup made of two pounds of sugar and three fourths of a pint of water poisoned with arsenate of soda . Dissolve three grams of the arsenate of soda in a little water and add to the syrup . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back to their nests , where the queen and the young ants will be // poisoned , gradually killing the whole colony . There are prepared products sold on the market that may be used in the same way . Sometimes the crack or opening through which the ants enter the house can be discovered ; if so , kerosene may be poured into it , or cotton soaked in kerosene may be stuck in the crack . The legs of tables may be set in cups of water as a means of guarding food from ants , but the better method is to use some means of killing the colony . COCKROACHES These insects are one of the most disgusting of household pests They prefer warmth and moisture , and are often attracted by wet scrubbing brushes , dish cloths , refrigerator pans , or any damp or moist article in a dark place . They will attack almost any foodstuff . They remain hidden during the daytime in cracks , under shelves , or behind baseboards of window casings , and forage at night . These pests are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one family to get rid of them unless they are controlled in the entire building . The first thing to be done in a house where cockroaches have been found is to clean everything thoroughly and to keep crumbs or other particles of food off shelves , tables , or cabinets . All food should be tightly covered . All wet mops , brushes , or rags should be removed . It is very difficult to rid a house of cockroaches and requires the utmost persistence . Insect powders sold for the purpose should be sprinkled in quantity around any cracks , along baseboards , or in other places where cockroaches may hide . The powder must be applied often . Powdered borax , sodium fluoride or pyrethrum are also recommended for this purpose . Traps made for catching cockroaches are sold and sometimes used . CLOTHES MOTHS The clothes moth is destructive to woolen fabrics , furs , carpets , and upholstery . Clothing which is frequently worn , or carpets and upholstery which are thoroughly cleaned frequently , especially with a vacuum cleaner , are not often injured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunks or closets for long periods that are attacked . THE KITCHEN I2I No garment should be put away dirty ; if clothing is to be dry cleansed the work should be done before it is stored ; other garments should be brushed and shaken thoroughly . The odors of camphor , cedar , lavender , tobacco , naphthalene , and tar paper are disagreeable to moths , and they are not apt to lay their eggs where such odors are prevalent . A small moth which flies about the house lays the eggs , and when these hatch , the larva feed upon the fabric to which the eggs were attached . Cedar paper bags , pliofilm or cellophane bags which have zipper fastenings and cedarwood cabinets are a great protection for clothing that is stored , providing the moth eggs are not deposited on the garment before it is placed in the- , container . These bags and cabinets are sold in drug stores and department stores . Cedar closets built in the house and cedar chests are also used as storage places for wool clothing or blankets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be wrapped in paper and the edges of the paper sealed together with gummed paper strips that may be purchased in rolls at the book or stationery store or the department store . Liquids of different kinds , to be sprayed on wool fabrics to be stored , may be purchased under various trade names . These can be used successfully without injury to the fabric , and are a good protection against moths . Benzine or kerosene may be sprayed on the inside of a closet or wooden chest before putting clothes into it for storage . When articles are very valuable ? as , for example , a fur coat ? it is often wise to send them to a cold-storage plant for the summer . In all large cities such plants may be found ; often department stores or women 's ready-to-wear stores advertise that they will furnish such storage for furs . BEDBUGS Bedbugs often gain access to a house by being carried into it . They may be brought in with the baggage of travelers or on clothing worn by someone , or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another where houses are close together . The bedbug is an insect especially disgusting to any housekeeper ; it is objectionable because of its bite , which may possibly be a means of transmitting disease . The bedbug prefers human blood to all other food . Metal beds are much better to use than wooden bedsteads in fighting // bedbugs . When possible , the bed infested should be taken apart and removed to a place where boiling water may be poured freely into all cracks and over all parts ; boiling water will kill both eggs and bugs . Such treatment will injure a wooden bed , however . Kerosene , gasoline , or benzine may be forced into cracks and crevices about a bed with a hand syringe or a feather every three or four days until the bugs have disappeared . A mixture of one pint of alcohol , one-half cup of spirits of turpentine , and one ounce of corrosive sublimate forced into the cracks is also effective . Houses that are badly infested with bedbugs may be fumigated with sulphur . The rooms should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or twelve hours . Sulphur candles are most convenient ; two to four pounds should be used for every thousand cubic feet of space . It must be remembered that sulphur fumes bleach curtains and colors in wall papers and fabrics , tarnish metals , and injure potted plants . Sometimes it will be necessary to remove wallpaper , to wash the walls and woodwork thoroughly , to repaper the walls , and to paint or varnish the woodwork in a house badly infested with bedbugs . MOSQUITOES A mosquito is disliked because of its poisonous bite , which causes an annoying itching sensation and may infect with disease the person bitten . All species of mosquitoes do not carry disease . Mosquitoes lay their eggs on the surface of water in ponds , pools , rain barrels , tanks , and similar places . The best method to use in exterminating them is to drain or fill up ponds and pools , and to empty barrels , tanks , and other receptacles in which water stands . When this method is not practicable , the water may be covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer . When water can not be treated in this manner , fishes such as goldfish , minnows , or silverfish , placed in the water , will destroy the mosquitoes . Repellants ( materials that drive away the mosquitoes ) , such as oil of citronella , may be used by people sitting on unscreened porches or in the yard or in the woods . A mixture of two ounces of citronella , two ounces of spirits of camphor , and one ounce of oil of cedar is recommended as a good one to sprinkle on a cloth to be hung on the head of the bed at night for the purpose of keeping the mosquitoes // away . Mosquito netting or bed nets may be used over beds when mosquitoes are annoying and no other means of extermination seems possible . Such a net should be so arranged that it hangs over the bed to the floor but does not touch the person in bed . Insect sprays such as are used for flies are useful on open porches or at picnics to keep the mosquitoes away but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least two different species of fleas are annoying to man : cat fleas and dog fleas . Flea bites are very annoying . Pet cats and dogs should be bathed often and kept as clean as possible . The rug or pillow on which a dog or cat sleeps should be beaten often and hung in the sun . It is sometimes better to provide sleeping quarters for pets outside the house . When houses are infested with dog and cat fleas , the carpets and rugs should be removed from the floors , which should be carefully swept , and the sweepings should be burned ; then the floors should be scrubbed with strong soapsuds or sprinkled with gasoline ( remember that gasoline is inflammable ) . Sprinkle gasoline over the back of the rugs . Shake naphthalene crystals or pyrethrum powder over the floor before putting down the rugs or carpets . Fleas do not like the odor of pennyroyal , naphthalene , or pyrethrum powder , and using these may drive the fleas from the room , but it does not kill them . Burning sulphur in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treatment of bedbugs , may be necessary to rid the house of fleas ; use four pounds of sulphur to each one thousand cubic feet of room space . CARPET BEETLES There are two kinds of carpet beetles that may be found in a house : ( r ) the " buffalo bug " or " buffalo moth , " and ( 2 ) the black carpet beetle . The larvae or grubs of these beetles really do the damage . The larva of the buffalo moth feed mainly on carpets , but may attack wool garments in closets , drawers , or trunks ; the larvae of the black carpet beetle eat carpets and also feathers , cereal products , and specimens in museums . It is difficult to rid a house of carpet beetles if the floors are covered with carpets ; in such a house it would be well to change from carpets 1 24 THE HOUSE AND ITS CARE to rugs , because in rugs the beetles will not so readily find hiding places suitable for their development . Clean the floors by the same method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out all cracks and pour benzine or kerosene into them , later filling them with crack filler . Tar paper may be laid under the rug if the odor is not too objectionable . The rugs should be watched constantly and cleaned frequently , and benzine or kerosene should be applied often around the baseboards . Sulphur may be used in the house when other means fail ; use not less than two pounds of sulphur for each one thousand cubic feet of space . SILVERFISH These insects are injurious to bookbindings , starched clothing , linen , curtains , stiff silks , and glazed paper . The place in which these pests are found should be kept well aired and dry . Pyrethrum powder should be sprinkled over bookshelves and in drawers where they are discovered , or sodium fluoride may be sprayed over such places . CENTIPEDES These insects are sometimes called " thousand-legged bugs , " and are found around heating pipes and registers or in moist places such as bathrooms , cellars , or damp closets . All clamp places should be constantly watched , thoroughly aired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder may be sprinkled where these pests are found . RATS AND MICE These animals are very dirty and destructive to have about a house . They eat food , leather , and clothing , and gnaw holes in wood . The best method of getting rid of them is by trapping them , using traps sold for the purpose . These may be baited with bacon , cheese , or buttered bread . Rat poisons may be used , but must be placed where children or pet animals will not be able to get at them . All holes or openings where such pests may enter a house should be covered with tin ; all food should be tightly covered , and all crumbs or bits of food that might attract the pests should be removed . // SQUIRRELS OP . CHIPMUNKS In some localities squirrels or chipmunks may be an annoyance in a house . The same methods for extermination may be applied to them as are used for rats and mice . TERMITES Termites , sometimes called white ants , damage the wood in build ings . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the structure , and before it is known that any damage is being done the wood may give way and much damage to the house will be the result . Termites live in the ground in colonies . When they want to reach wood above ground they build tubes or tunnels through which they go to the wood . Foundations for buildings should be constructed of concrete , brick or stone . It is suggested that a strip of metal which will not corrode , and which is wider than the foundation wall , be placed in the masonry with the projecting edges turned down at an angle to prevent contact with the earth . When a house is infested with termites it is necessary to employ experts to get rid of them . Be sure that the firm doing the work is a reliable one and that more than one treatment will be given if neces sary . PROBLEMS AND ACTIVITIES How would you calculate the number of cubic feet of space in a house ? Have you seen or heard of other household pests besides those mentioned ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VI THE DINING ROOM Many small houses are now being planned without dining rooms because the floor space can be more efficiently used in the living room . A dining room is usually only occupied two or three hours while the living room is used many hours each day . For this reason when the amount of floor area is small , many people feel that a large living room // rather than a small living room with a dining room is the preferable plan . When this scheme is followed the family meals may be served in a breakfast alcove off the kitchen , may be served on a table in the kitchen , or may be served on a table in one end of the living room . When the latter practice is followed , the dining table is usually of a type that can be pushed together and made into an attractive livingroom piece of furniture after the meal is finished . In a house of Modern design sometimes there is dining space arranged at right angles to the main part of the living room , which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but which becomes a part of the living room when not being used as a dining alcove . The larger house usually has a dining room . Sometimes this room is used for a second living room when such space is needed . When this is done often , the folding dining table is the desirable type to use in the room . SURVEY QUESTIONS z . For what purposes other than for dining have you seen dining rooms used ? 2 . Why do many people prefer to eat all their meals in dining rooms ? When would it be inconvenient to use a dining alcove for family meals ? 3 . In a house where only a dining alcove off the kitchen is provided , how and where may meals for guests be served ? Problem 1 . What Kind of a Floor Plan Is Desirable for a Dining Room ? The dining room has but one function : to furnish a place in which meals may be served and eaten . Its size depends upon the size of the family , the size of the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . It should be large enough so that serving may be easy ; it is estimated that to supply the space needed there should be at least three feet between the edge of the dining table , the wall , the buffet , or any other large piece of furniture in the room . A dining room rectangular in shape is preferable to one that is square , because it is easier to use conveniently when the dining table // They should be placed in the middle of a wall space . Windows maybe " double-hung " ; these are the common sliding windows with two sashes . Casement win-dows have one sash hinged at the side to swing out or in . French windows are casements extending to the floor and arranged in pairs to be used like double doors if desired . Good design requires that the top of the window frame should be on a line with the top of the door frame . A double-swinging door is best to use between the dining room and pantry or kitchen , because it makes the serving of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with or without doors connects the dining room and living room ; in a large house , the dining room may not be directly connected with the living room . A hallway may be arranged between the dining room and living room . In small houses or apartments often the dining room and living room are combined , making one large room , called a living-dining room , which may serve either purpose , whereas with the floor space made into two rooms both would be small . must be lengthened . A dining room eleven by fourteen feet in size is of good proportion . A dining room should be a light sunny room ; a southern or south-eastern exposure is preferable when it is possible to arrange to use this space in the house plan . The view from the dining-room windows should be a pleasing one . The dining room may open on to a porch or terrace with French doors . This arrangement is desir-able for a country home . Windows arranged in groups with no wall space between them are effective in the dining room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room so that the buffet or sideboard , serving table , chairs , or other articles of furniture , may be placed straight against the wall without interfering with doors or windows . A hardwood floor is satisfactory for the dining room . A waxed floor such as described for bedrooms is good . Floors are sometimes made of soft woods when they are to be covered with carpets . In farmhouses where the dining room is used as a place for serving meals to hired help , the floor is easier to keep in order if covered with plain linoleum or rubber tile or flooring , or with asphalt tile . A rug may be used over this when desired . Occasionally , in the large farmhouse , there are two dining rooms , one for the helpers and the other for the family . In such a plan , the dining room for the helpers should be connected with the kitchen , but disconnected from the family dining room . Such an arrangement requires more work on the part of the housekeeper , and is not generally practiced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the helpers ' dining table may be placed at one end . // The dining-room walls may be of plaster , tinted , painted , or pa-pered , paneled in wood , or finished with a combination of paneling and plaster . The dining room should be a cheerful room , and this effect can best be produced by avoiding the extensive use of dark colors . In the very large dining room , a wainscoting and standing finish of dark wood may be used ; in the small or medium-sized dining room , wood finish lighter in color is to be pre-ferred . Woodwork is used to complete the finish in a room , but also should be of decorative value ; hardwood finished to show the grain is effective , or the cheaper woods may be se-lected and painted . Walls finished in paneling , paint , or plain paper are more often used in dining rooms than vivid , figured wall papers . If the dining room and living room are connected with a large doorway , the walls are often decorated alike , since this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paneled with wood ; this may be painted , or finished like the woodwork when hardwood is used . In some houses , sideboards or buffets are built in when the house is constructed . If the design se-lected for this is good , the effect will often be pleasing . Such a buffet should be designed with adequate drawer space for holding table linen and silver , and with cupboard space if desired ; no ornate carving or colored glass should be used for decoration , and wood or plainly de-signed hardware should be employed for drawer pulls and door knobs . China closets are convenient when built in . These may be designed with glass doors if one wishes to display china in them . They are more // convenient when built straight in the wall rather than diagonally across the corners of the room , because the shelves are a better shape ; then , too , the shape of the room is not spoiled by cutting off the corners . In Colonial houses the " three cornered " cupboard may appropriately be used because this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be correctly placed in the room in order to produce the effect of proper balance . When one looks at a wall , one sees only a small part of it distinctly , and everything else within the general range of vision is seen more or less indistinctly . The eyes constantly move up and down and from side to side in order to obtain a clear impression of the whole wall , and tend to fixate the center of the wall . If a wall is well balanced , the various doors , windows , chairs , cabinets , tables , pictures , and other furnishings are in effect arranged on each side of the center , so that the eye is not attracted more to one side than to the other , and the mind is at ease , while a sense of tranquillity is produced . Many factors influence balance as used in house , planning and decoration , but in placing built-in features in a room it is well to balance a wall by putting them in the center of a wall space or far enough from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper placing of a group of furnishings . There are two kinds of balance : formal and occult . In formal balance the objects on each side of the // given center are alike and equally distant from the center , while in occult balance the objects are not alike and are placed at unequal distances from the center , but affect the mind as being equal in value through their shape , color , and grouping . The fixed decorations , such as doors , windows , and built-in furniture in the room , should usually emphasize formal balance . PROBLEMS AND ACTIVITIES Examine house plans and discuss the relation of dining room to kitchen , to pantry , to living room . Do any of the plans have a combined living and dining room ? Select a plan in which there is ( r ) plenty of light , ( 2 ) wall and floor space necessary for the furniture , and ( 3 ) convenient connection with the kitchen . Secure information concerning the following : hard woods commonly used for flooring and standing finish ; soft woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors which would be suitable for dining-room walls ; also wall paper that might be used . Select combinations of woodwork and wall color that will look well in a sunny , medium-sized dining room ; in a dark dining room . ( Perhaps water-color paints may be used for making these color schemes . ) Why do so many people eat in the kitchen or breakfast alcove in preference to eating in the dining room ? // Problem 2 . What Kinds of Floor Coverings and Draperies May Be Used in the Dining Room ? The walls and the floor form the background for the furnishings in a room . Often hardwood floors are lighter than the standing finish or wall decoration in a room , because a floor which is dark shows dust tracks easily and is harder to keep clean . In order to make the floor darker than the walls , it is necessary to select a rug dark in color and large enough to cover the floor , leaving a border of wood six to ten inches in width around the rug . In some houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done the floor need not be of hardwood . Rugs or carpets may be a plain color without design , or they may have a design , perhaps using several colors . A plain rug is the best background for the furniture placed upon it , and will make a small room appear larger ; but plain rugs , other than taupe-colored ones , show dust tracks and require a great deal more care than do figured carpets or rugs . Floor coverings should never be vivid in color , and only conven tionalized or geometric designs should be used . The pattern in a rug or carpet must be viewed from all angles , and should be effective when seen from any direction . Rugs decorated with designs of bunches of naturalistic flowers , bowknots , or animals should not be selected , be-cause a floor should be a flat surface ; then , too , no one should wish to walk over flowers or animals . Rugs with small patterns ? repeated often , so that the design becomes monotonous to the eye ? are best to select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con structed of strips of carpet . When a border is used , it should be narrow and unobtrusive in design . Carpets and rugs are made from the same materials and differ only in shape and size . Carpet is woven in strips that must be sewn together when used for a floor covering . Some rugs are woven in one piece ; others are made by sewing together strips of carpet , and are finished without a border . Rugs are made in standard sizes : // Small rugs to be used in doorways or elsewhere , and woven to match the large rugs , may be purchased in standard sizes : There are several kinds of carpet , varying in method of weaving and dyeing and in the materials used . Those suitable for dining-room use are Wilton , body Brussels , tapestry Brussels , velvet , rag rugs , and occasionally hemp and grass rugs . Perhaps ingrain may be selected , but it is not the best choice . Carpets and rugs may be divided into two classes : ( r ) flat , carpets that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile , carpets having either loops or tufts on the right side , with a foundation or back of some cheaper material , such as jute or hemp . Body Brussels carpet belongs to the pile class , its face being woven with small loops of yarn . The loops are of wool yarn , which has been dyed before weaving . The back of the carpet is usually of hemp or jute . The quality of body Brussels carpet depends on ( r ) the kind of yarn used , the best being made of worsted yarns ; ( 2 ) the number of threads in a loop , the better grades having the greater number , thereby making the surface of the carpet thicker ; ( 3 ) the number of loops in a given space , the best grades of carpet having them so close together that the backing does not show on the surface of the carpet ; ( 4 ) the class of dye used ; and ( 5 ) the material used for the backing , the best material being hemp . Body Brussels carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool yarns used on its face are woven through the backing so that they appear as flecks of color over the surface . Body Brussels is seldom used at the present time . Wilton carpet is woven on an especially constructed loom , called a Jacquard loom . In finishing , the loops are cut so that the pile is com posed of short-cut ends of yarn , called " tufts . " French Wiltons are usually woven in Oriental colors and patterns ; Royal Wilton is a trade name for a cheaper grade of Wilton ; Wilton Velvet is a cheaper grade ; Hartford Saxony has a longer nap than other Wiltons . Wiltons are made in excellent colors and designs , give good service , and are very popular for use in living rooms and dining rooms . // Tapestry Brussels , sometimes called " tapestry , " is a pile carpet having a face covered with loops of wool yarn and a backing usually of jute . It is woven so that the yarns do not show through the backing of the carpet , and can be distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much cheaper carpet than body Brussels , is not made of as good materials , and is woven in a much less substantial way . The designs and colors are often unattractive . In selecting a tapestry Brussels , choose one with thick , closely placed loops , since this will wear well and look well for a longer period . Velvet carpet is a pile carpet woven like tapestry Brussels , but with the loops cut . It is a cheaper carpet than Wilton of good grade . Hemp or linen rugs sold under trade names are sometimes used in dining rooms in small houses with informal furnishings or in summer cottages . They are less expensive than a good grade of wool rug , are well made , and come in pleasing colors . Rag rugs of large size are sometimes attractive in dining rooms . The rugs may be dyed one solid color , or several colors may be employed in making them . // Draperies for dining rooms may be of many kinds . Colored draperies should harmonize with the walls and other furnishings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are many doors and windows or where the other furnishings are in strong contrast to the walls , a close match between the color of walls and draperies may produce the best effect . The same general rule given relative to design in bedroom draperies should be followed in selecting draperies for the dining room . In most cases one set of curtains at a window is enough in the simply furnished and decorated house . " Draw " curtains , without glass curtains , are good to use on casement windows . These may be drawn across the window at night or during the daytime to shut out the light , thereby making it unnecessary to use window shades . Materials suitable to use for dining-room curtains are scrim , net , voile , marquisette , pongee , casement cloth , printed linen , crash , cretonne , and chintz . These may be used in various ways according to the type of window , the amount of light in the room , and the view through the window . When nets , voiles , scrims , or marquisettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory or cream color when the woodwork is other than white ; with white wood-work use the white material . When two sets of curtains are used , those hung next to the glass are called the " inner " or " glass " curtains , and are used to soften the light in a room . The glass curtains should be consistent in texture and quality with the overdraperies or curtains ; for example , scrim or voile // should be used with cretonne , while silk marquisette would be suitable with silk . In some cases overdraperies are so hung that they may be used for " draw " curtains . Curtains for a house may be made at home or may be ordered through a firm doing such work , the latter being the much more expensive method . Before purchasing materials , measure the windows carefully , allowing additional length for hems and casings of the desired width . In wash materials , additional length must usually be allowed for shrinkage two or three inches being sufficient . Before cutting the material , consider the matching of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right or left . Cut the material by a thread if possible . For full-sized windows , a hem two and one half inches to three inches in width should be allowed . On shorter curtains two inches is wide enough . Stitching must be done straight , and the ends of casings and hems should be finished securely and neatly . Casings put in by hand are best when curtains are apt to shrink and must be let down . PROBLEMS AND ACTIVITIES Examine samples of carpet and discuss distinguishing features , quality , color , and design . ( Half-yard samples are best for this purpose . ) If possible visit a store where rugs and carpets are sold . What are the prices of different kinds of 9 ' X 12 ' rugs ? From advertisements or from dealers , obtain the names of different kinds of hemp and grass rugs . What is the price of cretonne per yard ? Why are some kinds much more expensive than others ? Is it a wise plan to buy the cheaper grades ? Examine samples of scrim . Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will any of the threads move out of place easily ? Would this be a good quality to buy ? Why ? From textile books secure the names of different types of net . What are the prices of the different kinds used for window draperies ? If a window is six feet long and three feet six inches wide , including the frame , how much scrim would be required for a pair of curtains finished with a hem of three thicknesses and three inches wide , with a casing one inch wide and a heading one inch in width , with an allowance of two inches for shrinkage . Allow for covering all but three inches of the frame at the top and sides , and covering all of the " apron board " ( the frame below the window sill ) . What should be the width of the scrim used ? // Problem 3 . What Furniture May Be Used in the Dining Room ? The dining room should be furnished so that it has a cheerful , bright appearance ; yet the furnishings must be formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining table . Chairs are also necessary , and there may be a buffet , a serving table , and a wheel tray . Furniture for the dining room is usually sold in sets including a table , chairs , buffet or sideboard , serving table , and possibly a wheel tray . Period furniture is often used in dining rooms ; such styles as Jacobean , William and Mary , Heppelwhite , Sheraton , Chippendale , and Queen Anne , for instance . If a period style is selected , all the furniture must be of the same design , preferably purchased from the same dealer , because manufacturers use different methods of finishing the various period styles , and pieces from different factories may not // be alike . Furniture in Colonial design is suitable for many types of houses . In a small cottage or apartment , a gate-leg table with Windsor chairs , possibly with an English dresser in place of a buffet , makes an attractive group of furniture . Painted furniture also may be used in the small cottage or apartment . Dining tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the size selected must be determined by the size of the room . Round dining tables fit well into square rooms ; square or oblong-shaped tables are best in a rectangular room . The latter types always look better than a round table when lengthened to allow for extra places at the table . Tables made of mahogany , walnut , oak , or other hard woods should have a satin finish and should never be highly varnished . The tops should be made as nearly heat and water proof as possible . Chairs designed for dining rooms are strongest when the leg and the side strip of wood down the back of the chair is in one piece . If upholstery is used , leather or a smooth fabric like haircloth are good materials to select for dining-room chairs . Cane or rush seats are also used . Where the chairs are to receive hard usage , it is best to select those without upholstery . The back of a dining-room chair when too high interferes with the serving of a meal . The buffet should be simple in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes a long , plainly framed mirror hung above the buffet is attractive if beautiful pieces of silver or china are arranged on top of the buffet , because they are reflected in the mirror . Drawers should be long enough to hold tablecloths or other linen to be kept in them without mussing the ends of the linen . Drawers for silver are often lined with velvet in the more elaborate types of furniture . As a rule , dishes should not be kept in the sideboard or buffet , but rather in cupboards or china closets ; therefore little cupboard space is needed in the buffet . A serving table and a wheel tray are both useful in serving meals . The wheel tray is especially so when the housewife does the serving herself . As a rule , no pictures are needed for decoration on dining-room walls . Pictures of dead game or fish are not appropriate , because the subjects are not pleasing ones to consider during meal time . Potted plants are often pretty in a dining room when they do not // shut out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not used in great number . The dining table should stand on the center of the rug and as near the center of the room as possible . The lighting fixtures in a dining room may consist of a chandelier hung directly over the table , or at the ceiling , or the light may be supplied from wall brackets placed at various points on the wall . If a chandelier is used , it should be arranged so that the light is not thrown in the eyes of people seated at the table . " Cove " lighting , consisting of lights placed in a reflecting trough , which throws the light on the ceiling , is sometimes desirable in dining rooms , especially in houses of Modern style . Recessed lights in the ceiling above the , dining table are sometimes used . The placing of the buffet and chairs , when not at the table , is very // largely determined by the arrangement of windows and doors in a room . A buffet should always be placed in the middle of a wall space , chairs straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table near the kitchen or pantry door . When the table is not in use , all dishes and table linen should be removed and a doily should be placed at the center , on which may be set a bowl of flowers or some attractive piece of silver or china . Too much silver or china on top of the buffet , or a table on which are dishes to be used at the next meal , make a dining room have a cluttered appearance which is not attractive . PROBLEMS AND ACTIVITIES Visit a furniture store and study dining-room furniture . If this is not possible , then study pictures from catalogues , preferably with the reflectoscope . What are standard widths for dining-room tables ? Study pictures of the period styles mentioned in this section . Which styles would be easiest to dust ? Which would fit best into a small or medium-sized dining room ? Select a dining-room plan you consider desirable and place in it the furniture you think is required to make the room convenient and attractive . Select the kind of furniture you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furnishings . Is the rug needed for the room a standard-size rug ? If not , what size should it be ? Estimate the amount of carpet that would be needed for covering the floor . Would the design in the carpet have anything to do with the amount of carpet required ? Problem 4 . What Kinds of Table Linen Are Needed ? " Household linen " is the term ordinarily used to designate the sheets , pillow cases , napkins , tablecloths , doilies , and towels used in a home . Because these articles were originally all made of linen , they are still called " household linen , " although many of them are now made of cotton . Much of the table linen is now made of cotton or of part cotton and linen . Linen tablecloths and napkins are better than cotton ones because they look better on the table and will stay clean longer , and because stains may be more easily removed from them . Damask is the name given to the material from which tablecloths and napkins are made . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) double damask , woven with a double thread in the filling ( crosswise threads ) ; and ( 2 ) single damask , woven with a single thread in the filling . Double damask is more expensive and is heavier , and the pattern stands out more distinctly than in single damask . On the right side of double damask the background looks like a twill ( diagonal lines ) , while on the wrong side it looks like satin ; single damask looks much the same on both sides . In determining the quality of damask , buyers count the threads to an inch ; in a good double damask of medium quality there should be 18o warp and 28o filling threads . Table damask may be purchased either unbleached , silver bleached ( quarter , half , or three-quarters bleached ) , or bleached ; the bleached is the most expensive , because bleaching linen white is an expensive process . Heavily starched damasks should be avoided when buying , because the starch is added to cover up defects in the cloth . It will wash out when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality . Colored damask is now often used but is not as easily laundered because it may fade . Tablecloths are sold by the yard , having the border along the sides only ; or as " pattern cloths , " when the border design is woven on all four sides . Pattern cloths come in various sizes . Napkins are made to match tablecloths , and when one buys a tablecloth with napkins to match , it is called a " set " of table linen . When buying an expensive " set " of table linen , it is a wise plan to buy two or three dozen napkins , since they will wear out more quickly than the tablecloth . Napkins are woven with a border on four sides and , when they are to be made at home , are sold in strips of six or twelve napkins which can be cut apart for hemming . " Dinner napkins " are large napkins ; " luncheon napkins " are small . French hems are the most desirable finish for the edges of napkins . Napkins may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with machine-made scallops or hems . Luncheon napkins are sometimes finished with fringe . Madeira napkins are luncheon napkins hand embroidered and scalloped . Fashion in table linen changes . Sometimes large patterns in damask are preferred , while at other times small designs are the vogue . There are certain patterns always on the market which never go " out of style , " such as the snowdrop , the shamrock , or the fleur-de-lis patterns . // Small all-over designs , without wide stripes or large figures in satin weave , give the best service , since the long threads thrown on the top of the cloth to produce the larger designs are apt to pull and break in laundering . If one can judge the quality of linen , buying during the January sales will prove economical , because at that time invoices are being made in the stores , and patterns which have gone " out of style " or odds and ends left from stock will be put on sale and can be purchased at very reasonable prices . Colored linen sets may be purchased if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use when tired of the color . Cotton damask is a cotton material made to look like linen ; before laundering , it has a glossy finish much like linen damask . Cotton damask is extensively used because it is much less expensive than linen damask . The term " union " is applied to a half cotton and half linen material . Luncheon sets are now used extensively in place of tablecloths , because such a set is much more easily laundered than a tablecloth . They are made of linen , cretonne , oilcloth , cellophane , and a variety of other fabrics . Doilies may be round , when they come in sets of different sizes , four or five sizes being required for each cover ( individual place ) . Doilies are also made rectangular in shape and large enough to cover the space on the table needed for the dishes used in serving one person , when they are called " place " doilies . The center table doilies are made round , rectangular , or square , to match the place doilies used . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , the ends of which may be used as place doilies . Heavy linen , either white or colored , is attractive on the table , and the doilies may be finished on the edges for everyday use with a hemstitched hem , with scallops or with very narrow lace or crocheted edge . Elaborately embroidered or lace-trimmed doilies are suitable only for special occasions , and then only when the other table furnishings correspond in quality . Cheap lace used in such decoration is not suitable . Oilcloth and cellophane doilies are usually decorated with painted designs and are practical because they can be easily cleaned . Lunch or tea cloths are small square cloths coming in several sizes , the most-used size being thirty-six inches by thirty-six . They are made of damask and of the same materials used for doilies. // Buffet or sideboard scarfs and tray cloths are usually made of art linen . A buffet scarf should cover only the top of the buffet and should not hang over the ends , because the wood in a good buffet is more pleasing in appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizes , for placing under hot dishes on a dining table , are a necessity . The covers should be made so that they will slip off the pads easily for laundering . Other types of pads are used under hot dishes , but nothing is better than asbestos . Table linen , to look well , must be carefully laundered . It must be washed carefully and ironed correctly . Good-quality linen damask does not need starching , but must be very damp when ironed and should be ironed on both right and wrong sides . There are several ways to fold a tablecloth , one of the most popular being to fold the two side edges to the middle of the cloth , making two creases on the right side and lengthwise of the tablecloth , then fold through the middle lengthwise so that the third crease is on the right side of the cloth . If possible , wrap the cloth around a roll made for the purpose , so that no further creases need be made , and so that the folded edges will not be wrinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the material , especially when the doily is round . Doilies should not be folded , but should be wrapped on a roll or laid flat in a drawer . Table linen should never be used when soiled , since no table can appear well set when the linen is not immaculately clean . Most housekeepers prize good table linen ; it is one of the most difficult things to buy successfully , and it requires good care to keep it in the best condition . PROBLEMS AND ACTIVITIES Examine samples of table linen , discussing kinds , quality , and prices . If possible , have a pattern cloth and napkins among the collection . If the class could be taken to a store where table linen is sold , much information could be gained ; or perhaps a salesman would bring linens to the school and talk to the class . Discuss and demonstrate methods for removing coffee , tea , chocolate , cream , and fruit stains from table linen . Discuss the steps in the process of laundering table linen . If there is a school laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work may be done at home and the table linen brought to class for discussion and criticism . Make a list of the table linen which you would consider necessary for a // family consisting of two adults , a child of four years , a daughter of twelve , and a son of sixteen . What would be the total cost for these articles ? Collect samples of linen or other materials suitable for making table doilies . Estimate the amount of material which would be required for making six place doilies each twelve inches by seventeen when finished , and a runner twelve inches by forty-eight . If time permits , the class could make samples illustrating correct finishes to use on doilies . Doilies might be brought from home by each student , illustrating different methods of finishing . How is a French hem made ? Problem 5 . What China , Glassware , and Silverware Is Needed ? Dishes used in serving foods at the table are often called " china " or " tableware , " and may be of ( r ) earthenware or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather thick and heavy . It is not easily chipped or broken , and for that reason endures careless handling better than the more expensive porcelain . Earthenware or pottery dishes are made of clay with which other substances have been mixed , then shaped into the desired forms , dried , fired ( baked ) and glazed to make the surface nonabsorbent . Porcelain is often translucent , light in weight , and much more beautiful than earthenware . Porcelain was first made in China , thereby acquiring the name . Not until Revolutionary times did china become common on the dining tables of the colonists . Before that time dishes of wood , pewter , silver , and leather were used by the colonists . Both earthenware and porcelain are made from clay ; the people who work with the clay are called " potters " and the factories in which the work is done are called " potteries . " Until comparatively recent times , nearly all of the dishes used in this country were made in China , Japan , England , and other European countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . The types of clay used , the care exercised in handling the materials , the composition of the glaze ( the shiny material which covers the clay foundation ) , the temperature and the number of firings , and the form of decoration , are the factors which determine the kind of dish made . There are two grades of dishes that may be purchased : ( r ) " firsts , " which are perfect in shape , design , and glaze ; and ( 2 ) " seconds , " which are imperfect in shape or decoration . The latter should not be pur148 THE HOUSE AND ITS CARE chased when imperfect in glaze because the glaze is the protection . " Seconds " are less expensive than " firsts , " and often give good service for ordinary use . It is a wise plan to buy an " open stock " pattern , either in cheap or expensive dishes , because then those that match can usually be purchased to replace the broken ones in a " set . " A " set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saucers , soup dishes , sauce dishes , cereal dishes , platters , and vegetable dishes needed for the ordinary table service . Dishes having little decoration , such as bands of color , gold bands , or small conventionalized borders , are the best selection when plain white dishes are not desired . China decorated with gold bands should be purchased only when buying the best of china , because it requires a heavy band of gold and very careful firing to produce a band which wears well ; therefore this china is expensive . Elaborately decorated sets of dishes become very tiring and do not harmonize well with odd dishes that may be used with them . In buying china , one often indicates the pattern desired , the same pattern sometimes being produced in more than one grade or kind of china . Some of the designs being used on china are very old ; many kinds are named for the places in which they were first made , such as Chelsea or Leeds , while some kinds receive their names from the designers , such as Wedgwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from which the china receives its name are Chelsea , Dresden , Coalport , Royal Doulton , Worcester , Wedgwood , Delft , Derby , Copenhagen , and Spode . In the United States , china is generally known by the name of the town in which it is made ; for example , Lenox ware made at Lenox , Massachusetts , and Syracuse china made at Syracuse , New York . A rolled edge on chinaware prevents chipping and may be found on the best grades of china . Very thin porcelain must be handled carefully , because it will chip or break if knocked against other dishes or hard surfaces . Ridges in patterns make the dishes more difficult to care for ; raised designs , formed by attaching shaped pieces of clay to the body of the dish , should be examined carefully when purchasing , to see that the design is securely fastened ; otherwise it will soon be broken . The housewife must determine the number of dishes she needs according to the number in her family and according to the kind of meals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase twice as many // plates , cups and saucers , or other individual dishes as there are mem bers in the family . By this rule a set of dishes for a family of six might include : Sometimes dishes are sold in sets to be used for a special purpose ; such as a salad set , consisting of a salad bowl and plates to match ; a breakfast set , including the dishes needed for serving breakfast , or a set used for serving afternoon tea . The glassware used on the dining table includes footed tumblers , plain tumblers ( drinking glasses ) or goblets , bowls , sugar bowls and cream pitchers ( creamers ) , jelly and pickle dishes , salt cellars , vinegar and oil bottles , sauce dishes , salad plates , sherbet glasses , and deco rative pieces such as candlesticks , candelabra , and vases . These articles may be made of pure lead glass or of lime glass . Sometimes flint or rock crystal is used to produce a sparkling glassware . This is expensive but very beautiful . Lime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wears well . The molten ( melted ) glass may be shaped in a mold , blown into shape , or a combination of these processes may be used . Glassware is decorated in several ways : ( 1 ) by etching with acids , when it is known as " etched " glass ; ( 2 ) by cutting with emery wheels , when it is known as " cut " glass ; ( 3 ) by painting or en ameling ; ( 4 ) by engraving with small revolving copper discs to the edges of which are applied emery powder . Sometimes colored glass is used in making tableware , Bohemian glass being one example . Pressed glass is a molded glass , and if made of good quality glass is very attractive . Much of our glassware is made by this method . Cut glass may be broken by slight knocks or by changes in temperature . Cut glass is made of flint glass , thick glass being used ; therefore this type of glassware is heavier than plain , etched , or engraved glassware .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
