THE PORTABLE CONRAD ( 760 pp. ) - Selected &; edited by Morton Dauwen Zabel-Viking ( $2 ) . <P> <P> The range of Joseph Conrad 's material , as of his splendid glooms and lucidities in storytelling , could scarcely be better shown than in this collection of eleven long and short tales . They include , besides the familiar sea stories , tales of Poland , England and Asia . Among them are the classic Youth , Amy Foster , Typhoon , The Nigger of the Narcissus , Heart of Darkness . The editor , one of the best of U.S. literary critics , has shown good judgment in not chopping Conrad 's longer masterpieces into incomprehensible fragments just to get them inside an anthology . He has also made room for a score of Conrad 's wry and courtly letters and Conrad 's most important statements on the art of fiction . <P> Conrad was a rarely skilled practitioner of that art , and is one of its heroes . A Pole by birth , a merchant seaman and ship 's officer for 20 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Conrad became an English novelist only through creative sufferings of which it is painful to read ; Editor Zabel calls his exercise of will power " appalling . " Henry James found Conrad " absolutely alone as a votary of the way to do a thing that shall make it undergo most doing . " <P> A World Receded . In the 23 years since his death , as Editor Zabel says , " the world in which his tales are set has receded to historic distance and become , with its standards of honor and fidelity , a dimming memory in men 's minds . . . . " Marxian critics have found him " exotic " because he failed to write of factories ; a perennial kind of plain , impatient critic has found his preoccupations morbid . The stories assembled in this volume , and the longer novels , Victory , Nostromo and Under Western Eyes , make both these accusations seem as irrelevant as the " dating " of Conrad 's work . Neither time nor fashion really affects its nature , which is Sophoclean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life closes down . . . . " <P> Conrad was a master not only of English words but of various devices of storytelling , including what Mr. Zabel describes as " a complicated exercise of the mode of averted suspense " - enough so to drive his fascinated reader , at times , nearly to distraction . In its progression , elaboration and somber irony , his prose rarely loses for long the immediate visual impact of phrases such as the one describing Kurtz , emaciated yet commanding , sitting up to harangue the natives in Heart of Darkness : " I could see the cage of his ribs all astir , the bones of his arm waving . " <P> A Struggle of Truth . But the quality that distinguishes Conrad 's best writing from that of artists equally resourceful is his exhaustive and passionate honesty . As Zabel says , " He corrected the failure of his contemporaries to become morally implicated in what they were doing . " Zabel 's critical introduction to this book is a striking recognition of the fact that in Conrad 's case it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle to tell the truth ; all Conrad 's narratives in their way exemplify his own obedience to Stein 's famous injunction in Lord Jim : " . . . To the destructive element submit yourself , and with the exertions of your hands and feet in the water make the deep , deep sea keep you up . . . . "
