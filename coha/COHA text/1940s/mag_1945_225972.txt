This week half of the Cabinet which Harry S. Truman inherited from Franklin Delano Roosevelt was remodeled . In a flurry of handshakes , cocktail and tea parties , five Secretaries went out of office . <P> Retiring Secretary of State Ed Stettinius seemed satisfied with his new job ( see Foreign Relations ) . Labor Secretary Frances Perkins put aside her black tricorn , unveiled two " private hats " : 1 ) a broad , black-on-white sailor straw ; 2 ) a trim white Panama with black veil . She seemed to enjoy the leavetaking . At a farewell party at the Statler Hotel she gave Senator Robert F. Wagner an astonishing kiss on the cheek ; at another party she shook the hands of 1,800 Labor Department employes ( see cut ) . Her plans : a month in Maine with her ailing husband Paul Wilson ; beyond that she would not say . The other departing Cabinet officers were more definite about their futures . Francis Biddle would take up lawyering in Philadelphia . Frank Walker would go back to his chain of Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once his ten-year plum as Rural Electrification Administrator . <P> Meanwhile , on a flood of laudatory oratory , in rode Attorney General Thomas Campbell Clark , Postmaster General Robert Emmett Hannegan , Labor Secretary Lewis Baxter Schwellenbach , Agriculture Secretary Clinton Presba Anderson . This week 's plans called for James Francis Byrnes to be sworn in as Secretary of State ( see above ) . Washington gossips buzzed of further changes and more shake-ups to come .
