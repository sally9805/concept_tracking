The polls closed promptly at 6 p.m . By 7:15 , smiling , handsome Carlos Prio Socarras had heard enough of the returns to know that he would be Cuba 's next President . He left the Havana headquarters of the Autntico Party , hustled home to change his guayabera ( sport shirt ) and slacks for a white linen suit . Then he rode off to the presidential palace in a horn-tooting , placard-plastered motorcade . <P> In his second-floor office , President Ramn Grau San Martin gave his ex-student and fellow revolutionary a heartfelt Latin abrazo . " I 've said it many times before and I repeat it now , " said Grau , " Prio is well able to assume the direction of the destinies of Cuba . " Out in the Parque Central , thousands of excited Cubans tooted more horns , shot rockets into the tropical night . <P> At week 's end , the final tally gave Prio 889,000 votes . His Liberal opponent , Dr. Ricardo Nnez Portuondo , got 608,000 ; fiery little Senator " Eddy " Chibas got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cuban labor , still turned in 142,000 votes ( about 80,000 less than in 1944 ) for Dr. Juan Marinello . <P> President-elect Prio and the Autnticos also got a majority in Congress . But the minority might be lively . Among the new senators : moonfaced ex-Dictator Batista , who had directed his campaign from a deck chair in Daytona Beach , Fla. , and was expected to return to Cuba in September . <P> Cuban dopesters figured that Prio , so long as he gave the country good government , need not worry about Batista . A first and major job : driving the grafters from the public trough . When well-meaning friends like Eddy Chibas had gone to Grau and said , " Doctor , they are stealing , " the idealistic President had refused to believe it . Prio knows better .
