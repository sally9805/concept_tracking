For most of last week the days were fine and there was springlike warmth west of the Cologne plain , where the Germans expect the heaviest blows of U.S. and British power to fall . <P> The war seemed far away , except when the Germans sent over another swarm of V-bombs . G.I.s of the U.S. Ninth and First Armies brought out baseballs , played catch . Along some sectors not an enemy prisoner was taken . Patrols could not operate . There was nothing to do but to let nature and the Roer River take their course , according to German plan . <P> Smart Blast . By last week it was clear that the Germans had made perhaps their smartest move in their play for time by blasting the floodgates of the Schwammenauel dam . The Roer , usually only 75 feet wide and knee-deep , at some points was more than 1,000 feet of brown water spilled over forested flatlands . At others it was a raging , narrow torrent . <P> The Germans used the flood shrewdly , shifting their forces northward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crerar 's First Canadian Army as it swung southward from captured Cleve to chop out a protective flank for a Ruhr-aimed offensive by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery 's big British Second Army . <P> Slow Going . In the Rhine lowlands , Crerar 's troops were veterans of inundations . They hopped from island to island , from dike to dike , in their water-churning , mud-biting " Buffalo " and " Weasel " vehicles . On dry land the going was nearly as bad . The Germans had been able to concentrate . But by this week , behind fine air interference , Crerar 's men had hacked out a dozen miles of grip on the Rhine . More importantly , his kilted Scots had broken into Goch , a hub of roads running into the industrial district west of the Rhine . <P> " Monty 's " flank protection was almost set up . Apparently the last bit of everything Monty demanded was in place , the last bit of the strategic jigsaw ready to fall into place . Monty could sound the call . In an order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " We stand ready for the last round . . . . We will go for the knockout blow . "
