A wounded man , fresh from the battlefield , shocked Canada last week . Said Major Connie Smythe , M.C. , peacetime boss of Toronto 's Maple Leaf Hockey Club : Canadian overseas casualties were high because Canadian reinforcements were green and poorly trained . Major Smythe is recuperating at Toronto 's Chorley Park Military Hospital from wounds received at Caen . ' ' Many reinforcements , " he charged , " have never thrown a grenade . Practically all have little or no knowledge of the Bren gun and . . . most of them have never seen a Piat antitank gun , let alone fired one . " <P> These were serious charges from a man technically still in uniform and subject to military discipline . Smythe was baiting the Government as he had once baited referees . He had a purpose . He wanted Canadian taxpayers and parents to insist that Canada 's over 50,000 " Zombies " ( home-defense draftees ) , many of whom had been in uniform from two to three years , be sent overseas . <P> Smythe 's accusations angered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silence . But from Ottawa came inspired stories hinting that Soldier Smythe was gunning for a Tory nomination in the next federal election . <P> National Defense Headquarters said : " The statement is simply not understood . " This answered nothing , merely sidestepped the two questions all Canadians were asking : Are green men being rushed into battle ? Are men from engineering and other specialist units being transferred to the infantry reserves without sufficient training ? Snapped the usually even-tempered Ottawa Journal : " What we have here is an attempt at an official brushoff . . . . They the public want an answer and a civil and specific one . They Avant somebody-somebody in authority-to go between quotation marks . " <P> No one in the Canadian Cabinet seemed willing to do so . Whether or not Smythe 's charges were wide of their mark , there was one thing the Government could not deny : that many of the Zombies still at home and safe in Canada were better trained than some of the reinforcements going into the battle line .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
