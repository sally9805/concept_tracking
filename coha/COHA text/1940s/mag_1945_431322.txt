 | Watch out for a slender-tailed , bluish , wild pigeon about 18 inches long , with a slaty-blue head , metallically glistening neck , and breast of purplishbrownish-red . Spot him , and you 've got a neat little fortune coming to you . For that bird would be a Passenger Pigeon , and rewards totaling $5,000 have been offered for news of a nesting pair . Before you start your pigeon-hunt , though , I ought to tell you those rewards have been standing more than 30 years and nobody has collected them yet . So far as we know there are n't any more Passenger Pigeons . There were billions of them in your grandfather 's time , but the last one on record died in the Cincinnati zoo at one o'clock in the morning , September 2 , 1914 . Nowadays we ca n't imagine any bird 's being as plentiful as the Passenger Pigeon was until about 1880 . Gigantic flocks flew overhead for hours . The thunder of their wings was like the approach of a tornado . They blotted out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then they disappeared . But it 's no use kidding ourselves with ingenious explanations . The real answer is simple enough : Passenger Pigeons were birds of the forest , and for generations we have been cutting our forests to plant crops and build cities ; and for a hundred years we killed pigeons as fast as we could . So the Passenger Pigeon disappeared . Many grown men and women today never even heard of it ? they think you 're talking about the Carrier Pigeon or the Homing Pigeon . But the Passenger Pigeon , despite its name , did not carry messages nor did it have a highly developed homing instinct . Carriers and Homers are merely specialized breeds with the same ancestry as the Drawing by William Simon @# common domestic pigeon , that ubiquitous fowl that roosts on courthouse roofs and flutters around barnyards . The domestic pigeon is a Johnny-come-lately bird , bred from the Blue Rock Dove of Europe and Asia and domesticated no longer ago than Roman times . The Passenger Pigeon was something entirely different ? a true wild pigeon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of pigeon all over the world , and its ancestry belongs to " the dark backward and abysm of time . " The ordinary pigeon of the city streets averages about 11 inches in length , but the Passenger Pigeon was 15 to 18 inches long ? the longest of any American dove . ( Pigeon and dove are zoologically interchangeable terms . ) It had a wingspread of approximately 2 feet , and it weighed 12 ounces . We know these few facts because early ornithologists made measurements and kept records and also because a scant few stuffed specimens have survived in museums . Just who called it the Passenger Pigeon for the first time we do n't know ; for two or three hundred years the published accounts speak of simply the " wild pigeon . " The Passenger Pigeon was constantly wandering over areas of several hundred square miles in search of food , or making long flights in sundarkening flocks to its roosting or nesting grounds . But it did not migrate from the cold north to the warm south with the seasons , as so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were controlled chiefly by the food supply . An unseasonable snowstorm that covered the feeding grounds would send whole flocks winging southward a mile a minute to the virgin forests of Kentucky and Tennessee . As long as hardwood  | forests covered vast areas of the East and the Middle West , the Passenger Pigeon was assured of the enormous quantities of food its flocks required . Acorns , beechnuts , chestnuts , and other tree seeds were its staple provender , and the thickets and scrublands were an inexhaustible reservoir of blueberries , huckleberries , raspberries , wild cherries , pokeberries , and even caterpillars and other insects . The pigeon would eat almost any kind of green shoot or seed or berry ? a much wider variety , indeed , than our presentday domestic pigeon will eat . How many Passenger Pigeons were there in the United States , say , around the early part of the past century ? Well , in 1832 Alexander Wilson figured that a single flock he encountered near Frankfort , Kentucky , contained at least 2,230 , - 270,000 birds . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be , and that the flock was probably two or three times larger than his estimate ! , It is worth noting that this flock roosted in Kentucky and fed in the beech forests of Indiana and was merely one of the many flocks that then roamed the Middle West . J. J. Audubon , another careful observer , wrote about a great pigeon flight along the Kentucky bank of the Ohio River in 1813 . He counted 163 groups of pigeons passing overhead in 21 minutes , and as he journeyed onward the flocks came faster and faster . He finally quit counting before he reached Louisville at sunset , but " the pigeons were still passing in undiminished numbers and continued to do so for three days in succession . " NOWADAYS we are used to big figures ; newspaper reports of the war debt , passenger-miles flown by the airlines , freight-miles covered by the railroads accustom us to grasping the significance of millions and billions . Yet we need all our imagination to comprehend the numbers of Passenger Pigeons that existed within the memory of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consider how much food it would take to sustain that one flock of Wilson 's . If each bird ate only one pint of beechnuts and acorns ? which it could do easily ? the flock would consume 34,847,968 bushels in a single day ! That is pretty impressive , but the early ornithologists really surpassed themselves when they described the wild pigeon 's roosting and nesting sites . A Passenger Pigeon roost must have been one of the great wonders of the natural world . In 1840 Audubon described a roost on the banks of the Green River in Kentucky . It was more than 40 miles long and averaged more than 3 miles wide . " Many trees two feet in diameter , I observed , were broken off at no great distance from the ground , and the branches of many of the largest and tallest had given way as if the forest had been swept by a tornado . " He was in the roosting site one night when the pigeons were coming home , " and the noise they made , though , yet distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As the pigeons settled on the branches , perches were overloaded and crashed down , destroying hundreds of birds . 72 ( Continued from page 29 ) Another naturalist was in the roost near Hartford , Kentucky , in 1847 when the roaring of wings and the crash of falling limbs was so great that " even the next neighbors could not hear each other if they cried out with all the power of their lungs . " Incidentally , we usually think of the pigeon 's voice as a gentle cooing . The sounds our domestic pigeons make are certainly low , sweet , and pleasing . But domestic pigeons do n't have to compete against millions of other pigeons ; the Passenger Pigeon did , and its voice was correspondingly loud , strident , and raucous . S OME birds will not nest in the same tree with another bird of the same kind . Robins , for instance . But Passenger Pigeons wanted company , and millions of them nested in the same forest . Over an area of 100 square miles every tree was loaded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . As birdnests go , they were not pretentious ? merely a crisscross jumble of sticks in the fork of a limb 10 to 50 feet from the ground . Often they were so loosely woven that the young bird could be seen through the bottom . There was one egg , occasionally two , pure white like all pigeon eggs and slightly smaller than a domestic pigeon 's . The incubation period was 14 days ? 4 days shorter than that of the domestic pigeon . The Passenger Pigeon reared three or four broods a year . Some of the best-known nesting grounds were in the forests of Michigan , and the Petoskey site is especially famous because the last great nesting in the state took place there in 1878 , when the pigeon slaughter reached its peak . Nobody knows how many Passenger Pigeons were killed in the Petoskey nesting of that year . One investigator estimated that a billion birds were destroyed . That may be a high figure , but it is known that 300 tons of dead birds were shipped to Midwestern and Eastern markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was easiest for the market hunters to get at them , and this was the most profitable season , too , for squabs and young birds were better eating than tough , dark-meated , older birds . Today our game laws protect wildlife during the breeding period ; but nobody believed the Passenger Pigeon could be exterminated ? in fact , some oldtimers claimed that the more you killed , the more they bred and the more plentiful they were the next season . In 1848 Massachusetts even passed a law protecting not the pigeons , but the pigeon hunters ' nets and traps . The Petoskey nesting of 1878 and its ferocious slaughter disproved all theories about the indestructibility of the Passenger Pigeon , for the bird never again nested in Michigan in any considerable numbers . Five thousand netters and hunters made their living from Passenger Pigeons that year , half of them in the actual nesting site at the day-after-day job of killing , packing , and shipping pigeons . The methods of slaughter varied from place to place and from time to time , but generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slow- witted bird . In the birch forests of the North the loose bark was sometimes set afire , so that a whole tree flamed like a giant torch and caused the young birds to leap from the nests . That method of extermination was practised mostly for sport however , or to provide food for droves of hogs that were brought from miles around to fatten on the carcasses . Also , trenches were dug and baited with grain , and when the pigeons alighted to feed , a single blast of a gun loaded with fine shot might kill as many as 75 . Big nets were used in the Arkansas nesting sites and took as many as 3,000 birds at one springing of the trap . Passenger Pigeons were indeed Big Business from the 1840 's right to the sudden end in the ' 70 's . During those years the telegraph and comparatively fast mail service spread over the United States , and the " pigeoners , " as the professional netters were called , were in constant touch with roosting and nesting places . Wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail . One vast flock nested in Missouri in April sometime in the ' 70 's , and most of the squabs were killed by the pigeoners . The flock then went to Michigan and was reported all along the way . The hunters were ready and killed off the second nesting of squabs . Again the pigeons moved , this time to Ulster County , New York ; but the netters were waiting for them and finished them off . Uncounted tons were sent to the New York market . This was the last recorded pigeon killing in New York State . As late as 1879 dead birds brought 35 to 40 cents a dozen at the nesting sites , 50 to 60 cents a dozen on the Chicago market . Live birds that could be fattened and fed up for increased tenderness were worth $1 to $2 a dozen . A good pigeoner , working alone , could make $10 to $40 a day . THE end came swiftly . Stray flocks of Passenger Pigeons survived here and there in the Middle West and the Southwest until the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the century the birds were rarities on the market . In 1908 , one Col. A. R. Kuser stood up in the meeting of the American Ornithological Union in New York and offered $1,000 for a pair of Passenger Pigeons . On second thought , he amended his offer to read , " for news of the existence of living Passenger Pigeons in the wild . " He was afraid someone would kill the last birds in existence . He need n't have worried . It was already too late to collect his offer or any of the other rewards posted about the same time . Many attempts were made to collect , of course , but the birds always turned out to be Band-Tailed Pigeons , Red-Billed Pigeons , Mourning Doves , or something else . The Passenger Pigeon was gone as a wild species , and the only survivors were about a dozen in captivity ? in the Cincinnati Zoo and in the aviaries of a Chicago professor . One by one they died , and then there were none . None at all . That is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars you were going to win by discovering a pair of slender-tailed , bluish , wild pigeons about 18 inches long .
