PLEASURE DOME ( 372 pp. ) - Lloyd Frankenberg-Houghton Mifflin ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> Poet-Critic Lloyd Frankenberg started with a good idea . He would write a plain-spoken book to " provide a bridge to modern poetry for readers . . . brought up on prose . " And since " poetry is an art of the ear 's discrimination , " he would persuade a record company to issue an album of readings by the poets discussed in his book . The result : this batch of essays on modern poetry and an identically titled album ( Columbia , 8 sides , $4.95 ; or LP , $4.85 ) of readings by T. S. Eliot , W. H. Auden , Dylan Thomas and other modern poets . <P> Since Frankenberg does n't mean Pleasure Dome to be profound literary criticism , and since it is n't , it can be judged by only one standard : Does it really help the ordinary intelligent reader-the kind who might tackle a Faulkner novel but shies away from an Eliot poem-to understand and enjoy 20th Century poetry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not condescendingly by the hand , Frankenberg plunges directly into the work of the modern poets . In an illuminating essay on T. S. Eliot he anticipates and answers many of the questions readers are likely to ask about Eliot 's poetry . He shows in detail how Eliot mixes pretentious eloquence and street slang , ancient myths and snatches of borrowed verse to portray an age of " social fright . " As Frankenberg traces Eliot 's poetic development from weary irony to religious faith , the reader does learn something about the moods and mechanics of modern poetry . <P> Similarly , Frankenberg shows how Poet E. E , Cummings intends his wrenchings of language , typography and punctuation as devices to praise the individual " human " in man and to satirize his faceless " public " front ; how the delicate verses of Poetess Marianne Moore pounce on details of sight and touch in a way prose seldom does ( " the blades of the oars moving together like the feet of water-spiders " ) . <P> But midway through Pleasure Dome in an essay on Insuranceman-Poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little-magazine jargon , while the eager reader waits expectantly on the bridge between prose and poetry . Author and reader never quite meet again , and from here on , if the reader is to get across that bridge , he has to do it by himself . <P> The Records . The album of records accompanying Frankenberg 's book is good &; bad in about the same proportions as the book itself . Unfortunately , poets are not necessarily the best readers of their work . Poetess Moore reads her verse as if she had just been frightened by a ferocious rabbit , Poetess Elizabeth Bishop as if she were a bored high-school sophomore , Poet Cummings as if he were an English gentleman slightly repelled by his own rowdy verses , and Poet-Physician William Carlos Williams as if he were droning out a prescription for a head cold . <P> The cause of poetry is somewhat redeemed by English Poet Dylan Thomas and by T. S. Eliot . Thomas reads with a rich , controlled romantic lilt , and Eliot 's dramatic rendering of a passage from The Waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader begins to discover the pleasures poetry can sometimes yield without guides , crutches or bridges .
