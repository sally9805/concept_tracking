An aunt of William Grant Still 's once asked him , " Billy , what do you do ? " " I compose music , " Still replied . " Yes , I know , " she said . " But what do you do ? Have n't you any work ? " <P> At 53 , big-eyed Billy Still still has no " work . " But he is the U.S. 's leading Negro composer . His melodic , sometimes fiercely rhythmic symphonies and tone poems have been performed by Stokowski , <P> Rodzinski and Monteux . He was the first Negro to conduct a major U.S. orchestra ( the Los Angeles Philharmonic ) . But somehow , the big breaks that have brought fame &; fortune to less deserving composers have never seemed to come Still 's way . <P> His latest blow came with a new suite for string quartet , based on Panamanian folk music . It was given a first performance last fortnight in Los Angeles , but the Los Angeles critics were not there ; they had to cover the Ojai ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor . What 's more , the area around the Still concert was roped off to traffic because of some relay races at the nearby Coliseum . Conditions were not ideal for a premiere , but listeners who struggled in found it worth the effort . <P> Mississippi-born Composer Still 's music has a homespun quality , but it is as varied as his own background of Scottish , Irish , American Indian and Negro ancestors . He tries to avoid repeating himself ( " after all , an architect would n't want to design the same kind of house all the time " ) . Making movie music ( at $250 a day ) ceased to interest him because he felt that he had to do " my work in my own good time , and in my own good way . . . " <P> The Still way is scratching out only a few bars a day in his modest Los Angeles home . His great enthusiasm is opera : he has written four , but none has ever been published . One of them , Troubled Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughes , was rejected by the Metropolitan , says Still , because it called for an all-Negro cast . " They never heard of makeup , I guess . " <P> He has hopes that New York 's energetic City Opera ( TIME , Nov. 3 ) will perform one of his operas : " Now that I have one foot in the grave he is in good health at 53 , I guess I 've got a better chance .
