Iowa 's famed tall corn is getting too big for its roots . Now some lowans would like to breed back into U.S. corn the qualities which were sacrificed for bumper size and bumper production . They would like to reinvigorate corn with greater root strength and resistance to heat , drought , insects and disease . <P> Two such corn-doctors are Iowa State College 's President Charles E. Friley and Professor I. E. Melhus . Firmly believing that the way to study a plant is to go back to its place of origin , they were in Guatemala recently putting the final touches to a namey venture called the Iowa State College Guatemala Tropical Research Center-a corn study station in the beautiful ghost town of Antigua . 60 miles from Guatemala City . <P> They had gone to the right place . Experts say that most corn varieties are native to Guatemala and southern Mexico - just as the peach is native to China . the English walnut to Persia , celery to the Mediterranean . Sometime around the 5th Century , primitive South American corn , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed with the strong , tall gamma grass which grows in Central America . Result of this crossbreeding was teosinte , an earless corn-producing plant which still grows wild in Mexico and the highlands of Guatemala . Crossed and recrossed with South American corn , teosinte produced the elongated ear and regular rows characteristic of modern corn . <P> I.S.C.G.T.R.C. got started in 1943 when Earl May , a wealthy Iowa nurseryman , put up $75,000 for a five-year investigation of primitive corn . The following year a group of Guatemalan businessmen offered $150,000 to U.S. agricultural colleges for research work in Guatemala . Iowa State snapped up both offers . <P> Early next summer a double-handful of Iowa State graduate students and undergraduate specialists will move into a spacious colonial mansion in Antigua . The Guatemalans have offered free use of the necessary land . If the planned cross-breeding experiments work out , both Iowa and Guatemala may soon have better , if not bigger corn .
