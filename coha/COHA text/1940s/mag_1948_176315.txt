When Odessa struck oil 15 years ago , West Texans yahooed with delight . Last week , when a man named Hoiles struck Odessa ( pop . 40,000 ) , few citizens knew whether to toss their Stetsons into the air or jump on them . Even by Texas standards , the newcomer looked as ruggedly individualistic as a steer on the loose . <P> Terrible-tempered Publisher Raymond Cyrus Hoiles , 69 , who already owned six newspapers in five states , * bought the Odessa American , in partnership with 20 employees , for more than $200,000 . Like the Chicago Tribune , whose editorials he reprints on days when his own spleen is small , Publisher Hoiles knows how to make people mad and make it pay . <P> Minority Prophet . " R.C. " is against unions ( the Hoiles papers are all open shop ) , majority rule ( " The majority ca n't give my consent to anything " ) , progressive , income taxes ( " nothing but socialism " ) , public education ( " a house of prostitution is voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe ( " Let ' em go to hell " ) . He considers both Herbert Hoover and Earl Warren too leftwing . Two things Publisher Hoiles is in favor of : child labor for the average , child ( " Give him a pick &; shovel and let him get started " ) and the black market . One touch of liberalism in the Hoiles record : during the war , he campaigned to give U.S. Japanese a fair break . <P> Born in Alliance , Ohio , Hoiles went to public school because he did n't have any say in the matter , then to a Methodist college . He started work on his older brother 's newspaper in Alliance for $2 a week , was making $10,000 a year when they had a falling-out over R.C. 's labor-baiting views . Then R.C. published an anti-union paper in industrial Mansfield , Ohio , sold out ( for a profit ) after enemies blew up his front porch . <P> Healthy Profit . Moving to California , Hoiles bought the Register , doubled its circulation , became the richest man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another to his string . <P> With the help of two sons and a daughter , all of whom work for him , Publisher Hoiles runs his chain from Santa Ana . He shouts his letters and columns to a long-suffering secretary , passes out pamphlets on Christ and taxes to all comers , harangues editors , reporters and the janitor . But he confines his independent opinions to his signed column . Says he : " The news columns do n't belong to us . We 're just like stenographers . " <P> Even his enemies admit that he tells the news . Most Hoiles readers have little choice , anyway : six of his seven papers are monopolies . Hoiles has survived two dynamitings , four strikes , and floods of counter-denunciation . Sample ( from a Colorado Springs pastor ) : " They say Hoiles has a Stone-Age philosophy . That is an injustice to the Stone Age . . . " <P> <P> * The Santa Ana , Calif .
