During his last turbulent years in public office , David Lilienthal had often turned the phrases over in his mind . They came easily last week as he wrote his letter to the President . " I submit herewith my resignation as chairman and member of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission ... to be effective at the close of business on December 31 , 1949 . " <P> The letter was not a complete surprise ( TiME , Nov. 28 ) . Lilienthal had hinted broadly that , at 50 , he had found it high time to divorce himself from Government salaries ( present salary : $17,500 ) and start building for his own financial future . " These years have certainly been strenuous and exacting , " he wrote , " but they have also been very rewarding , in every way except financially . . . " And , added articulate David Lilienthal , he had long wanted the chance to discuss the problems of the atom more freely " than is either feasible or suitable for one who carries specific public responsibilities . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmentioned , but one was written large in last summer 's headlines . In answering up to Republican Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper 's charges of maladministration , Lilienthal had rekindled the partisan politics which blazed up during the fight over his nomination . Should he stand for reappointment in 1950 , he reasoned that neither he nor the program would benefit from another tumultuous going-over . <P> There was another , more subtle factor . Under Chairman Lilienthal 's stewardship , the U.S. atomic program had successfully made the transition from military to civilian control . Production and morale were up ; personnel turnover had been reduced ; scientific research had taken big strides ( see SCIENCE ) . But with Russian possession of the bomb , new readjustments were bound to come . It was probably time for congressional re-evaluation of the Atomic Energy ( McMahon ) Act of 1946 , for redefining problems of secrecy and military security , for clarifying the checks &; balances on AEC-the " advisory " scientists , the military liaison officers , the joint congressional " watchdog " committee itself . Any changes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less controversial AEC chairman . <P> <P> On Call . Lilienthal 's old enemies were jubilant . Cried Tennessee 's aged Senator Kenneth McKellar , who had badgered Lilienthal ever since his days with the Tennessee Valley Authority : " The country is better off . " , But Illinois ' Senator Paul Douglas declared that David Lilienthal was a " great public servant " who deserved to know that " the great mass of Americans recognize the splendid work he has done . " In a letter of unusual warmth and appreciation to " Dear Dave , " President Harry Truman agreed . " Reluctantly and with the utmost regret , " he accepted the resignation , but with the understanding that Lilienthal would still be on call at any time .
