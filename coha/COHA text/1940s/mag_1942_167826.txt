A Chinese last week was doing his quiet bit to enlighten Manhattanites on a subject of great current interest to China-India . C. T. Loo , noted dealer and connoisseur , after a quarter-century of patient collecting , opened a display of " The Sculpture of Greater India . " The people who went to contemplate his 69 hard-won pieces in stone and bronze were mainly Mr. Loo 's friends-museum curators , students , artists . While the learned visitors took their tea , found a corner for sketching , or discussed the possible influence of Buddha upon Christ , the gods of ancient India-Brahma , Siva , Vishnu , Buddha- looked down with old smiles . <P> The U.S. finds it difficult to understand Indian art-which , in any case , it rarely sees . Life for the Occidental is rarely " a prolonged sacrament " - the description of the life of the Indian given in Mr. Loo 's catalogue . Hindu and Buddhist art , arising from intense spiritual concentration , assumed symbolic forms and sectarian twists that only long study can clarify . U.S. amateurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Buddhist art ( oddly serene ) . <P> Hinduism came before Buddhism in India , and lasted longer . Of the numerous Hindu deities , Brahma is boss , with Vishnu , the preserver , and Siva , god of destruction and creation , making up the Hindu trinity . The Hindu measures his own brevity by a vast time sense : a day in the life of Brahma runs roughly to 4,320,000,000 earthly years . Siva , as Lord of the Dance , is sometimes represented as both masculine and feminine ( see cut ) and incarnates the pulse of this cosmic life . " In the night of Brahma , " says an Indian scholar , " Nature is inert , and can not dance till Siva wills it : He rises from his rapture , and dancing sends through inert matter pulsing waves of awakening sound , and lo ! matter also dances , appearing as a glory round about Him . . . . " <P> Buddhism , which originated in India in the 5th Century B.C. , had spread all over the East but practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascendancy mellowed Indian sculpture into a less sensuous character . Instead of the bulbous breasts , swivel hips , wasp waists and whirling , multiple arms of Hinduism 's gods , the Buddha had a repose of form and peace of countenance somewhat like that of the greatest Greek sculpture . <P> The person who became known as Buddha devoted his life to seeking a way out of the unending cycles of rebirth to which the Hindu and his universe , through Siva , were bound . Through asceticism and contemplation Buddha found his goal of complete and final extinction ( nirvana ) . His perfect enlightenment ( bodhi ) in this matter was what caused him to smile , and all his images to smile . On 57th Street in Manhattan last week they still smiled .
