The General was interviewed while he was shaving . <P> President Truman had just given him one of the nation 's three most important command jobs : chief of the U.S. Army Air Forces . Was n't everyone surprised that the announcement had come so soon ? " Tooey " Spaatz , amiable man of few words , continued to shave , back turned . When would he officially take over ? " About Feb. 15 . " Was it possible he still might enter Pennsylvania politics ? " I might have if they had n't offered me Arnold 's job . " <P> The General grinned , rinsed his leathery face , got dressed and marched off to his first meeting as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Able , ailing 59-year-old " Hap " Arnold had been retired after 42 years of soldiering , 34 years of it in the air , seven years of it as boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flown a long way from the Army 's nest in that time , would soon fly away , never to return . Tooey Spaatz , sure by all signs to boss the U.S. 's first separate Air Force , had big plans for the future .
