txt War Move Held Expedient Prompt Declaration Viewed as Means of Uniting Discordant Elements To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The time has come for the President to call for a declaration of war . The nation is waiting for Congress to make such a declaration . The minute it is made , the disagreements between the interventionists and the pacifists and isolationists will be at an end , the differences between management and labor will be composed , and the whole country will unite in the common purpose of defeating the enemy . Mr. Roosevelt must not let himself be hampered by the views he held and expressed in the Presidential campaign a year ago . The complete change in the course of the war since that time compels the President , just as it is compelling the rest of the nation , to realize that America can best assure the downfall of the Axis powers by formally entering the conflict . Twelve months ago no one could have foreseen the sudden German attack on her ally or Russia 's amazing resistance . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army and air force , we clearly should throw every ounce of our strength into the battle . If great issues are at stake for us in the outcome of the war , neither our wisdom nor our self-respect will allow us to let Britain , Russia and China do all the fighting . Every consideration of morality , of long-term policy and of expediency demands that we declare war immediately , CYRUS S. EATON . Cleveland , Nov. 3 , 1941.
