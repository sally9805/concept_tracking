Last week an armored division , a motorized infantry division , and aircraft practiced together at Fort Benning , Ga . In the U.S. Army , this event was news . Hitherto the Army has had neither the equipment nor the foresight to play at such modern elementals on a realistic scale . <P> Observation aircraft , insufficiently trained in cooperative war , hunted ground targets , sometimes failed to find them . Light bombers staged a smoothly timed , independent attack on armored units , also attacked with and ahead of infantry , artillery , tanks . Air officers squabbled with each other and with ground officers . Main lessons from this first field study were that the Army 1 ) needs a great deal more of the same , 2 ) will have to unify the commands of air and ground forces in the field before their joint practice makes perfect .
