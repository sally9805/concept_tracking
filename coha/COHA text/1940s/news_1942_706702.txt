txt Precaution Urged in Case of Raid In case of an actual air raid , it is almost certain that some section of the subway will be put out of commission , trapping hundreds , or even thousands , of people underground . What will happen then ? How can two or three trainmen control and direct these riders , perhaps closely crowded , in a rush hour ? They 'll not remain calm and quiet indefinitely , especially those near the explosion . A plan of procedure should be worked out in advance , made known , and the riding public educated as to just what to do . Also , the habitual carrying of small pocket flashlights by every one should be urged . Unless adequate educational steps are taken there is grave danger of serious , and unnecessary , injury to many of our citizens when a raid comes . C. M. SAxE .
