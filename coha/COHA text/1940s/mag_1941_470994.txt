THE tall Australian Major was courte-ouss but he was firm . " Your identity papers , please . " I fumbled in the breast pocket of my dust-coated tunic and produced the safe-conduct letter Headquarters had written for me in Cairo , now many miles away . The Major gave me a sharp , quick look , opened the letter and read with care . For a moment I watched his blue eyes travel back and forth as they followed the typewritten lines down the page , across the top of which was printed in bold letters ? ON HIS MAJESTY 'S SERVICE . The letter said that Captain Muir of the American Field Service had come to Egypt with a group of American ambulance drivers , that the equipment promised them from England had not yet arrived , and that meanwhile Captain Muir wished to visit the Libyan front to study the conditions under which the ambulances might have to be used . The Major was a fine-looking soldier , tall and hard and determined . His jaw was square and set , his face was tanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand in the western desert . On each broad shoulder he wore an embroidered crown to signify that he held the rank of major , and his uniform was the khaki battle-dress of the ordinary Tommy . Telephones rang incessantly in the several rooms that gave into the one where we stood . The rooms were furnished only with wooden benches and bare wooden tables , on which were heaped documents and military maps in orderly disorder . Muted voices andguarded language that meant nothing to the uninitiated went out over the wires to the different sectors of the front as officers and men gave and received instructions . The names of places were never mentioned . Each one must have had a special designation which I did not know , so that English was as useless in helping me understand what was going on as a language from some strange planet would have been . Windows were closed tightly and covered with heavy paper to keep in the light . Tobruk was not a " healthy " place , as soldiers put it , and night raiders from the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . The atmosphere was heavy and smoke-filled , and while there was a certain tenseness the men about me worked on calmly and efficiently . Ringing telephones , quiet voices , rattling maps and papers , the strong odor of stale smoke . Outside the sounds were different . Through closed windows I could hear the humming motors of German observation planes , flying high above the little port , the sharp crack of the " ack-ack " ( anti-aircraft ) guns , and an occasional burst of machine-gun fire from the ground crews . Only once a terrific thud and a trembling earth told us that a stick of bombs had been dropped nearby . Soldiers looked up , exchanged knowing glances , and returned to their jobs . The Australian Major continued to study my letter as though he had heard nothing . From time to time the crack of single rifle shots rang through the night as a nervous sentry fired on a shadow , and this led me to believe that the Germans could not be far away . I had no way of knowing even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left Alexandria , the news was that they had taken Benghazi and that their motorized columns were coming east in what looked like a drive on the Suez Canal . But I had gone a long way in three days . Perhaps the enemy had too . No news had been available in the desert , and since my arrival in Tobruk I had not dared ask questions until my identity was established beyond a doubt . Inquisitive people are not popular up there . The Major finished reading , folded the letter , placed it in the envelope , and returned it to me . When he spoke he looked me squarely in the eyes and frowned slightly . " We can not be too careful , " he said . " I hope you will understand and pardon my being suspicious , not only of you but of every man or officer who is not personally known to me . That is my business . " I assured him that I understood better than most , having gone through the Battle of France slightly less than a year ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity of observing the German fifth column at its best ? or worst . His face relaxed at this and he smiled , but immediately turned serious again and continued to speak , watching my reactions closely . " Since you are familiar with fifth-column methods , " he said , then lowered his voice and carefully spaced his words for effect , " ? you ? mustknow ? that ? the ? paper ? you carry there ? could be easily ? falsified . " This must have made me start slightly . " Have you a British military card ? " the Australian asked , seeing my embarrassment and trying to be helpful . I explained that I had applied and been promised one , but that it had not come through before my departure from Cairo . Then I remembered my American passport . It was not one of the old red-covered ones , filled with convincing-looking visas from many parts of the world , but a green one of recent vintage , issued only a few weeks before at the Legation . By some turn of luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called in on account of counterfeiting and replaced by the ugly little green books . My identity was accepted , he smiled broadly , shook my hand and introduced himself . " Sorry , old man , " he said . " Come and have a glass of beer . " On our way down a long corridor toward the officers ' mess he talked affably , telling me that the Germans had dropped parachutists during the afternoon sand storm . " I think we got them all , " he said . " But one never knows with Jerry . He 's a clever fellow . Some of the ' chutists died fighting and some surrendered . Useful information they gave us too . " Now I understood the general tension , why I had had so much trouble passing the outer guard , and why sentries were potting away nervously at shadows and stray cats that passed in the darkness . A loose Boche or two , dressed in any sort of uniform , might be wandering about ready to do his job . They are experts at sabotage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here we arc , " my host said , pushing open a door and ushering me into a brightly lighted room with whitewashed walls . " Make yourself at home . " Several officers sat round the large table drinking beer , smoking and talking quietly . They got up , shook hands cordially when I was introduced , and soon began asking questions about Cairo . They gave the impression that this city on the Nile where I had so recently been was another world , a dream world where one was clean , saw civilians , talked to women , even danced and heard music . Here in the desert they were starved for that other world , and yet their conversation was light , their questions put in a bantering tone , their laughter easy . The senior officer in the room , a full colonel , sat across the table from me . He was a sharp-nosed fellow , florid , bald , with a hearty laugh , which fairly shook his belly when I told him that I was off in the morning on my way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha , ha , ha ! " I could not see why this should amuse him , until he finally controlled his laughter enough to tell me that the Germans had beaten me there by thirty-six hours . " You 'll have to wait a bit ? that is , unless you want to pay Jerry a visit . " To pay Jerry a visit was the last thing in the world I did want . I had been caught north of the Loire River in France on June 17 , 1940 , had passed the night behind the barbed wire of a prison camp , and had escaped the following day ; so I had had a taste of a visit to Jerry , knew just what it meant , and sincerely preferred a bomb on top of my head to another capture . The Colonel laughed again when I told him this . " You did n't miss by far to-day . There 's a motorized column to the south and well to the east of us . He 'll be cutting in toward the sea any minute now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . You 'll never get out by road . " This was bad news , and now I understood why Tommies had been busily destroying the road leading in from the direction of Bardia when I came over it . A column to the south and east ! " I 'm an old soldier , and I have seen many battles , " continued the officer , " but desert warfare seems the craziest of all to my way of thinking . Perhaps it is the best , however , because civilians and property come less into the picture . It is a soldier 's game ? and a tough one . " He stopped to light his pipe , then went on . " It is more like sea than land fighting , and I have Wavell to thank for this theory . As in a naval engagement , you try to choose the battleground most advantageous to you , the spot where you can most effectively destroy the enemy 's men and machines , regardless of whether your ships , or forces , are a few hundred miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The loss of a thousand square miles of sand is no more important to us than theloss of a thousand square miles of the Atlantic if we are able to choose the spot where the fight shall take place and inflict heavier losses on the enemy than he inflicts on us . " " Is that why we have let go , almost without a struggle , so much of our conquered territory ? " asked a young lieutenant . " Precisely . We 've given up enough sand to dry out the Atlantic , but sand is n't what we need at the moment . Give it to Jerry . He 's ' bought ' the desert . Now let 's see what he can do with it . My opinion is that the desert will beat him . We 'll see . " Conversation lagged for a moment , and I asked the Australian Major whether I might have some of the cheese and bread which I saw at the other end of the table . I had had little food on my trip up and was rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese and bread but also bully beef and more beer . The world looked brighter after I did away with this , and when the Colonel and Major began questioning me about my trip from Cairo to Tobruk I was able to sit back , smoke , and talk easily . II For over a week I had been sticking close to Shepheard 's Hotel in Cairo , awaiting telephone calls from G.H.Q. And several had come . One to say that a seat had been held for me on a plane to Tobruk for Tuesday morning , six o'clock sharp " . . . and do n't be late ! " The second call came through Monday night ( they work early and late at G.H.Q. ) . It was the voice of my invaluable and excellent friend Mac , a Canadian captain . " You 've been put off until the Thursday plane , Pete , " he said , and there was as much disappointment in his voice as I felt myself . " Brass-hats , you know . They get precedence . " Wednesday evening I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and celebrating this with a cool and cheering gin and bitters , when the fat little Sudanese page boy called me to the telephone . It was Mac , all right , and his voice was more dejected than ever . " Same old story , Pete . Colonel This and Brigadier That . . you know . . . . ' Who 's this Captain Muir ? . . . Oh , dreadfully sorry , but we must get up to Tobruk immediately . . regret it no end . . . most imperative . ' " I asked Mac what the chances were of ever getting up , and he said to give him a little time and he would work it somehow . On Sunday he did . " A convoy of lorries is leaving at dawn to-morrow from Camp A , " he told me . " Here 's a letter for the officer in charge if you want to risk it . Of course you might catch the Tuesday plane , which will be a much easier trip , and . . . " " Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm taking no more chances on being thrown off planes at the last minute , and I know that brass-hats do n't ridc on trucks . " About six-foot-four of luck was with me in the form of Andy Ransom , one of the best drivers I took out to the Middle East . He was lunching with Mac and me , and could drive me down to Camp A in an ambulance I had borrowed from the British Red Cross . One lunches late in Cairo and it was now about two-thirty . If we hurried we might make Camp A , which is near Alexandria , before nightfall . I was most anxious to do this because it is a large camp and the difficulty of finding a unit in the dark is great ; so I threw a few things into my rucksack , including the single blanket I had used in France , and filled my canteen with fresh water ; and without finishing lunch we started . Andy drove the big ambulance as though it had been a light racing car . He handled it beautifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where a fleet of feluccas was passing , past Mena House and the Pyramids and on to the hot desert . For some miles there were tents where soldiers bivouacked , and then nothing but an overwhelming sense of space . Mirages sprung up to right and left , only to disappear suddenly as we neared them at sixty miles an hour . Small flocks of sheep and camels tended by Bedouins grazed on meager prickly shrubs in the blazing sun . I knew that camels could go for long stretches without water , but how the sheep lived was a problem that baffled me . We passed convoy after convoy of heavily loaded trucks , mostly of American make , going in our direction . AlI the material was new and looked excellent . From some of the trucks the dark , intelligent faces of Indians peered , and others were filled with English troops . The soldiers shouted at us good naturedly as we hurried on , holding their thumbs up with characteristic optimism . Darkness had fallen when we reached the first tents of Camp A and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we were lucky to have , it was very white and looked like snow ; and as the evening chill succeeded the heat of day the illusion of a winter sport scene was almost complete . At length we found the officer in command of the convoy we were looking for . He was still up and about , busily attending to final details . He was very cordial , agreed to take me , gave the hour of departure and excused himself , saying that there were still many things to do before daylight if he hoped to get off in time . Andy wanted to spend the night in the desert , and indeed it was beautiful there with the stars and moon so near ? but I was hungry , and knew that the next days held little for me in the way of bodily comfort , so I insisted that we go into Alexandria , have a late but hot dinner , a bath , and a short sleep . This was a happy decision and one for which I was thankful during the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next morning before sunrise when we arrived at Camp A preparations for the departure were under way . Motors were warming up and soldiers moved about smartly , loading baggage and seeing that everything was in perfect order . As the light became brighter the sand changed back into sand , our snow field disappeared , and the day promised to be hot and clear . Forty-one big three-ton trucks , a staff car , and five motor cycles made up the convoy . At first we were to run at hundred-yard intervals , and when we came to the zone where there was danger of bombing this was to be doubled , making the distance roughly five miles from head to tail . I rode in the staff car with the commanding officer , who drove , and his chauffeur-batman , who sat in the rear seat . Ransom came to a snappy salute as we started out and turned left on the main road , heading due west in the direction of the Libyan Desert . I watched him standing there tall and alone , and felt sorry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually good and his company always excellent . We did not go through Alexandria but took a short cut off to the left . The road was not bad between high dunes on one side and date groves on the other . Beyond the date groves spread the vast Mediterranean , as unbelievably blue in Egypt as I had known it on the French and Italian Rivieras . The convoy moved without interruption along the undulating road like a great serpent , of which we appeared to be the head . At intervals a motor cycle would come alongside , and without stopping the rider would make his report to Captain Smith . Car number thirty-three had dropped out with engine trouble and the repair truck was with it . Then the rider would swing about and roar back to the crippled car , only to return a short time later to inform the Captain that repairs had been effected . Smith was of the push-on-as-far-asyou-can school . I could not blame him for this , but I was very hungry by one o'clock when we finally pulled up , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the safety zone , so that it was not difficult for the kitchen truck to move up and down the line distributinglunch , which consisted of a piece of bread and a small triangle of Swiss cheese . Something had gone wrong with the stove and the usual tea had been abandoned . This was not a luxurious luncheon , and I could have done with a great deal more ; but the example set by the soldiers about me was so excellent that I quickly forgot myself . There was not a complaint from these fellows who had been handling heavy trucks since dawn ; they ate their slim ration quietly and without comment , smoked and joked . That night , after a long day 's run , we camped on a plateau above Matruh , the first town along this line where we had come upon any recent destruction . During the Italian advance Mussolini 's " gallant " aviators had visited it quite often . Needless to say , it had been practically undefended at that time . Houses were badly knocked about , streets were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population had been completely evacuated . During this whole trip we passed only one woman and two men who were not in uniform . There were also signs of the British advance to be seen in Matruh : much captured Italian material that had been salvaged and brought back from the successful advance into Libya . To my surprise I noticed W 0 P painted in large letters on all the Italian trucks , guns and tanks . " When did the English adopt our slang expression for the Eye-tyes ? " I asked Smith . He wanted to know what I meant , and then explained , laughing , " W 0 P may spell Wop in any language , but to us it simply means War Office Property . " From Matruh on the roads could hardly be called roads at all . Those that were left had been so cut up by tanks and shellfire that it was usually preferable to head straight across the desert , following as nearly as possible along the shore of the Mediterranean . There was no sand storm that day , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the first car we were lucky , except when our own dust swirled around with the wind and enveloped us in thick clouds that cut off our vision . I was particularly sorry for the motor-cycle riders , who came up to make their reports so covered that they were completely unrecognizable . The poor Australian infantrymen who were accompanying us from Matruh must have been taking an awful beating in the open-backed trucks . Despite all this every car and man arrived in perfect condition at Sidi Barrani during the early part of the afternoon , We would have liked to push on but orders awaited us to stop there . Later Smith told me that the convoy was being taken up slowly and carefully , so as to avoid the possibility of a flank movement and capture by the German motorized column which was known to be somewhere south of us and moving east . III Sidi Barrani had really been banged about . This was as far as the Italians had come in their unsuccessful drive on the Suez Canal . Then the English had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in the place , and left Italian material destroyed and scattered in every direction . The enemy 's losses must have been staggering . As far as the eye could see , Italian tanks , trucks , guns , automobiles , and airplanes were spread out across the desert , burned , destroyed , overturned . From tracks in the sand you could see where drivers had desperately attempted to escape with their vehicles only to be pursued and annihilated by the British attacking forces . Our trucks were spread out some distance apart , in case of an air raid , in a large hollow between a rise of ground and the devastated village . I walked off alone and stood trying to visualize the attack , which I knew had been made in a violent sand storm . Hundreds of tanks and light armored cars , followed by infantry , had swept over the rise of land and down on the Eye-tyes ( as the English call the Italians ) before they realized what was happening . There must have been wild scenes ; sand storms are dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank with spitting machine-guns , or charging infantry with bayonets fixed , it must be terrifying . It was at Sidi Barrani that the Italians began to run , and those who did not give themselves up continued running with but few stops until the British decided to halt the chase . By that time they had covered several hundred miles , and were well into Cirenaica . Nor did they dare come back until they could do so under the comforting protection of their German Master 's wing . Up here I found that no one really disliked the Eye-tye . As a soldier he was considered a joke , and the general opinion was that as long as he stuck to music and the waiter 's trade he was quite a decent fellow . That II Duce had tried to make a soldier of him was regarded as rather pathetic . I do n't believe the British actually got angry at the Italians , even when they were fighting them . The Germans , however , were quite another dish of tea . They were hated for every reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the pleasant voice of Captain Smith who , accompanied by his lieutenant , had come up behind me . " How about a drink ? " I accepted with pleasure but did not see where we were to get one until he pointed to a low building on the crest of the hill that had been spared by some miracle . He informed me that this was a canteen . The canteen was a spacious , one-storied affair , and the English had probably passed it in the sand storm without seeing it . A few pock-marks in the walls showed that shells had burst nearby . Otherwise he fighting had left it untouched . On the walls were the usual Italian inscriptions , badly done in black paint . VIVA IL DUCE-VIVA IL RE-VIVA anything they could think of from Victory to the name of some unknown town , painted there by a homesick Dago . One inscription read : " From the Alps to the Pyramids , " and another was a famous saying from one of Mussolini 's more bombastic harangues : " Better to live a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamb . " Perhaps he was referring to the British lion and the Italian lamb . At all events , the thousands of Italian prisoners that I had seen appeared vastly to prefer the lamb idea . The Australians were there before us , drinking beer from tins . As officers , we were ushered into the bedroom of the manager and offered whisky . The canteen manager rustled also , from heaven knows where , ham , eggs , and potatoes , and made for us what was perhaps one of the finest meals I have ever tasted . There seemed to be only one grave shortage here , and that was fresh water ; I was told that so much water was needed for motorized warfare that it was difficult to keep enough on hand for drinking and cooking . Washing of course was out of the question . My canteen was already half empty and I could not get it filled . Australian soldiers are generally regarded as splendid fighters , but most unruly when not actually engaged in battle . However this mood must be reserved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were as well behaved as any group of men I have ever seen . They pitched their tents , slept in the open or under the shelter of wrecked cars , and by nine-thirty were quiet , with the exception of one fellow who had found some abandoned Italian hand-grenades and was trying them out some distance away from camp . Soon he also tired of the game and all was silent . Captain Smith learned that I had nearly frozen the night before and had kindly found three extra blankets somewhere in the convoy . The single blanket that had kept me warm in France was entirely inadequate out here in Egypt . On leaving Cairo I had thought that I could curl up in the warm sand and sleep happily ; but the sand grows cold , very cold , and I had cursed the fool who wrote ? " Till the sands of the desert grow cold . " He had certainly never been out here at night . The road from Sidi Barrani to Sollum was practically nonexistent , and we drove most of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean as our guide . The dust was terrific but , having made a very early start , we arrived about noon . Here Smith received instructions that he would have to wait for orders . He might receive them during the day or he might be held over for several days . I could not afford to risk the time that might elapse until the convoy continued and , slinging my rucksack on my back , I bade my companions good-by and started up the road to the west on foot , determined to thumb my way on somehow or other . Most of the traffic going up consisted of armored cars , which were useless to me as there is absolutely no extra space when the crew is on board , and they were fully manned . It was very hot and I was dirty but neither downhearted nor discouraged . Someone would pick me up sooner or later I was sure , and I trudged on singing , " Roll Out the Barrel . " Sollum was pretty well battered up , but not as badly as Sidi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the foot of a long , winding road that goes up in harsh zigzags to the plateau where Bardia is situated . At the beginning of this pass there was a military control station where all individual cars or convoy commanders must stop and show their movement papers . This seemed a good place to wait and do my thumbing . After about an hour my patience was rewarded . An English major of the Third X Battalion motorized cavalry stopped at the barrier . He was driving the repair car and was on his way back to join his outfit which had been pretty badly shot up . At first he hesitated , his small truck being already overloaded , but when he heard that I was an American and had come all the way from New York on the job I was doing he agreed to take me as far as Tobruk . Up the winding pass we drove and across the high plateau . Bardia was in plain view off to the right , but the road did not go through it . The plateau was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanks , trucks , armored cars , and light field cannon lined up by the hundreds hub to hub ? all destroyed beyond repair . The Italians must have been taken completely by surprise here and had no time to withdraw . At dusk we stopped to make a cup of tea before entering Tobruk . The Major 's batman , who was riding in the back , dug a hole in the sand and soon had a fire going , and the Englishman explained that they did this every evening before dark so that the enemy could not spot the fire . He also explained that each separate unit carried complete sustenance for five days , so that the crew could live that long even if lost in the desert . Compasses were also a necessary part of the equipment for such eventualities . The tea was good , and after two cups each we continued on our way in the semi-darkness between sunset and the rising of the moon . Several times along the road sentries stopped us at bayonet point . The officer showed his papers and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the road was being torn up and mined against the possibility of a flank attack by the Germans . The sentries joked with us and seemed in high good humor at the thought of meeting Jerry at last . A soldier on duty outside headquarters led us into a lighted room , where I was separated from my tank-corps companion and turned over to the Australian Major for questioning . At least I had got as far as Tobruk ? two days before the Germans cut it of completely by land . The Australian Major showed me to a large room which was to be mine for the night . Against the right wall as you entered a stretcher had been prepared for me to sleep on . There was no other furniture and the room was completely bare . A single light hung down from the middle of the ceiling , but nothing happened when I turned the switch ; it was broken . The officer sent a batman for a candle . Opposite the door there was a long window , tightly closed and covered with black paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be opened it also kept out the air . Evidently the room had not been inhabited since the British took the town , because in one corner there was still a pile of hastily swept-up refuse , old Italian newspapers and dirt . From the pile the ugly face of Mussolini peered at me , more hideous than ever in the dancing half-light . A gleam of light from the hallway came in through the glass transom , and because of this I could not open the window even if I blew out my candle . But I did not want to blow out the candle . Nor did I want to sleep . I was afraid . Not afraid of being bombed , perhaps wounded , or even killed , but of being taken prisoner a second time . I had escaped once , but the second time . . . Try as I would to change my thoughts , I could not keep the idea of capture out of my head . Suppose the British evacuated Tobruk silently , this very night , and forgot to warn me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers , tunic , and shoes beside the stretcher in such a way that I could get into them immediately , and lay down . Outside the sounds bad changed . There was less droning of motors , is ack-ack fire , and the rattle of machine-guns had disappeared some time before . Rifles of nervous sentries cracked , but at longer intervals . Now and again horns blew . A telephone rang in an office down the hall at intervals of about every three minutes and a tired voice answered . I could not understand the conversations , but at least the voice was English and as long as I could hear it I knew that the town had not been deserted . For a long time , possessed by the thought that I might be left behind in Tobruk , I tried to keep awake , first by talking to myself , then by pinching myself , or making plans for the future . Nothing helped , and I realized that I was losing consciousness in spite of my efforts . The absence of the ringing telephone brought me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my watch showed midnight . I knew that wars and military telephones do not stop at midnight . I started to get out of bed and make inquiries , but I was too sleepy . I turned over and went to sleep . When I woke up I could sec a tiny point of light across the room , and the sirens were wailing . In an instant I was wide awake and hurrying into my clothes . The pin point of light came in through the window . It must be daylight . Already I could hear the first ack-ack guns and the hum of motors . My immediate idea was that the enemy was attacking the town , but on listening closely I could detect no other fire save that of anti-aircraft batteries . This was reassuring , and I did not bother to throw my belongings into the rucksack . I would not have to run farther than the shelter . This was my first raid since France and my heart beat with excitement . Carefully , with trembling hands , I lighted a cigarette before sauntering out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably muster while still keeping up my pace . The sound of exploding shells was growing nearer , as was the roar of motors , and machine-guns rattled . The shelter to which I was assigned was in the courtyard . I did not go down , having a phobia against being buried alive , but an officer standing near me in the door said that it was very deep and well built . The Italians had dug it , and they had done a good job . Over the entrance was carved in huge block letters the name BENITO MUSSOLINI , and this amused the British no end . Above the entrance to another one across the court was inscribed VITTORIO EMANUELE High above , in the still dim light of dawn , several planes were visible . They were probably over for observation , not bombing , and when three Hurricanes appeared on the horizon they quickly made off to the west . The sirens blew again . This time it was the even note of the " all clear " not the eerie yowl of the Alerte . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , hung my steel mirror to the window knob and spread my shaving kit on the sill . My canteen was empty . With something of a shock I realized that since leaving Camp A I had been drinking , washing , and shaving from this quart bottle without a single refill ? and I had shaved every morning . Of course I had n't been able to rinse the brush or clean the razor , and my washing had been accomplished by pouring a few drops of water on a towel corner and using that to remove the soap . Then a few more drops on another corner for the mouth and eyes . It is amazing how much better this is than nothing at all and how much happier one feels after these meager ablutions . The old hand-pump in French villages , which we used to scorn and swear at , now seemed Like an undreamed-of luxury . Quantities of fresh water was what I longed for , and when I went downstairs again , this time with my empty canteen , I found that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of water in Tobruk , and it was slightly salty . The cook was a kindly fellow and measured two cups for me as carefully as though he had been pouring Napoleon brandy . He emptied these into my canteen after assuring himself that no one was looking and told me not to mention it outside . Otherwise , he said , there would be a hundred men at his door begging . With my precious ration I hurried back to the room and prepared to shave . But luck was not with me this morning . just as I had worked up the most beautiful lather the sirens went off again . Two planes came into my line of vision , flying so low that I could clearly distinguish their black crosses painted on each wing . They were moving fast , and I stopped shaving to watch and pray that the ack-ack fire would bring down one or both of them . The puffs of white smoke from the shells seemed to be getting nearer and nearer to the leading plane . The plane nosed over and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one a hospital ship , were anchored . I could see the bombs as the first stick was released , and although the harbor was out of sight behind the houses , the crash that followed shook our building and rattled every window . The second plane nosed over for the dive and seemed to run head on into a puff of smoke . It was a direct hit from an anti-aircraft gun , and the plane tumbled into the sea , carrying its crew and leaving a black streamer behind it . Feeling slightly cleaner and with a great sense of elation at having seen the bomber come down , I set out to look for my Australian Major . He had promised transportation to take me farther into the desert toward Derna , where I should find the headquarters of Brigadier Walker , head of the medical corps for this sector . Brigadier is a new rank created since the beginning of the war , and is one between a full colonel and a major general . It used to be brigadier general , but this made so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . V The Major was at breakfast and asked me to join him , which I gladly did , having smelled the odor of fresh-cooked bacon . The tea was steaming hot , but had a distinct salty taste from the water which , however , quenched thirst satisfactorily . Beside bacon there was fresh bread , butter , and jam . Practically allsupplies came in by sea , and there seemed to be enough of everything . I was told that a good reserve of food and ammunition had been stored in case of siege , and that with control of the sea the garrison could hold out for a long time if not indefinitely . A Ford station wagon was put at my disposal to go up into the desert . I must say it gave me an odd feeling to be traveling about Tobruk in a conveyance that was so closely associated in my mind with the peaceful hills and dales of Westchester and Connecticut ! The driver knew his desert , and about seven miles west of Tobruk turned off the road and took me straight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with the sand . It was a barren spot , and during dust storms must have been terrible . The Brigadier sat at a wooden table in front of his tent , conversing earnestly with a medical corps Captain . Both of them looked up when I approached and saluted , then rose to greet me . I showed my letter from G.H.Q. , Cairo , to Walker and explained the mission that had brought me here . The object of my visit was to inspect ambulances and discuss methods for handling wounded in the desert . We had a long talk , comparing notes on the care of the wounded and on ambulance equipment . Then the Captain and I went off on foot for a tour of inspection of some ambulances that were scattered in a nearby field , and as we walked along he told me something of the work he and his men had been doing . Indeed they had been laboring under the greatest difficulties , due entirely to lack of cars . The sooner we could get help up the better . I shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be some time before we were ready to function on a scale that would be helpful , perhaps many months . " Well , " he said , " I suppose we shall just have to carry on the best we can , but do hurry . " We inspected several ambulances and discussed their shortcomings ; and since we were wandering about the outer fortifications of Tobruk , we stopped several times to chat with the town 's most advanced defenders . Accents and uniform markings differed widely , but the men had one thing n common ? high morale . Here an ack-ack battery was manned by Cockneys , whose jocular remarks could hardly be understood by a nearby Bren-gun crew of stalwarts from distant Australia ; there Yorkshiremen stood by a tank and tried to use the King 's English , not forgetting their articles , when speaking to an officer of high rank . Each and every one , whether officer or soldier , Cockney , Yorkshire-man , or Colonial , had the look in his eye of calm determination , and I felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dirt was another thing these courageous , smiling soldiers had in common . They were , without exception , filthy . Out here the water supply was used almost entirely for interior consumption , it was so scarce , and I learned that it was against military regulations to shave more than once a week . It was hard to believe that these men belonged to the army of His Britannic Majesty , the smartest army in the world under normal circumstances . Their clothes had not been washed in weeks , perhaps months , and neither had their bodies . Dust and sand from the storms had collected in their ears , and was caked in their beards and eyebrows . Their faces were dark brown from exposure to sun and wind , plus dirt , snaking their teeth look whiter than usual when they smiled or laughed , which was often . Downhearted ? Not these men . Defeated ? Never . They would give an account of themselves when the time came . A wave of sadness came over me as we walked back towards the tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there would be fierce fighting . Many of these filthy , courageous , smiling fellows would be killed , others wounded . It was of the latter that I thought particularly . Imust waste no time in Tobruk now , but hurry back to Cairo and get on with the job . When the Brigadier and I were about half way between the desert camp and town , the ack-acks , accompanied by the rat-tat-tat-tat of machine guns , began such a heavy barrage that the chauffeur pulled off the road and we got out to see what was going on above . Eight German bombers were flying fast and surprisingly low in the direction of the port . They were not near us , and as there was no danger , we stood there above the town and watched the show . Tracer bullets scorched across the sky and white puffs burst about the planes , but they continued straight toward their objective . The din of the firing was deafening , particularly from a battery not ten yards away . For a moment I watched the crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I could not hear his commands above the general roar . The officer and men seemed to be a mechanical part of their gun , so perfect and calm were their movements , so in rhythm with their weapon . It was beautiful to watch . The eight raiders were skirting along the edge of the sea and were coming closer and closer to the harbor . Another minute and they would be over it . At this moment Walker grabbed my arm , pointing with his free hand . " Look , old man . Look , " he said . I turned ? and let out a yell of sheer joy . Half a squadron of Hurricanes were coming in the opposite direction , their motors full out and whining angrily . They were still some distance away , but the Germans also saw them , and instead of diving to drop their bombs , let them go from the level at which they were flying . It was too high for accuracy , and we watched them explode in the outer port , throwing up great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harming neither man nor property . The Germans banked sharply and turned in the direction of their lines , the Hurricanes coming on until the leader was in firing distance of a lagging raider . One blast from the Britisher 's guns and his enemy burst into flames . Two of the crew were able to bail out and floated down into the sea . What happened to them I do not know , and frankly I do not care . By this time the other planes were out of sight , and I only hope that the pursuing Hurricanes got them all . After this bit of excitement we continued on our way into town . Brigadier Walker took me to the Royal Air Force headquarters , and introduced me to a kindly , gray-haired flight commander . There was a bomber going toward Alexandria within the hour . It was carrying men and materials to a field situated about two hundred miles from Cairo , and there would be room for me . The Commander ' phoned the field and told them that I was corning . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get off before the Germans came back . " This time Jerry may bring protection , and the plane you 're riding in would n't have much chance against a Messerschmitt . " I took his advice , and after thanking him and saying good-by to Walker , hurried to collect my kit . On the way I ran into my friend , the Australian Major . He had a mission to perform near the air field and would take me there himself . I was glad of this . After all he had been very kind to me once he had done his duty . Fighter-pilots lounged about the field in their flying togs , ready to take off at a moment 's notice . They stood in groups or sat on the ground , smoking and talking , laughing and joking . They were mostly blue-eyed boys in their early twenties , and only their dust-coated beards showed that they had reached manhood . I was introduced to the pilot of the plane which was to take me away , and to a very young Australian with an unusually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that his Hurricane had been shot down the previous day but not before he had accounted for two Me. 109s . He had bailed out and escaped the German patrols by hiding in a wadi until night fell , when he had been able to make his way back to the English lines . Both motors of our bomber were warming up , and the rear machine-gunner was at his place in the tail , when we were ordered to board . The Major and I shook hands warmly . He had to shout to make himself heard above the motors ' roar , and evidently he was thinking of the story I had told him last night about my capture in France . " Jerry did n't get you this time , " he yelled laughing , and then we were off heading east . extra decades . On the last day of his life he did a long , hard day 's work and then went home , where friends came in after dinner . And , a few hours later , he dropped dead while playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , unless perhaps he might have wished he could live long enough to finish the rubber . But we are all going to leave some rubber unfinished . - ELMER DAVIS JUST as we went to press the Tolan Com-mittee ? otherwise known as the House Select Committee to Investigate the Interstate Migration of Destitute Citizens ? reached Detroit and there the Governor of Michigan told them of the dire prospects ahead of those Michigan communities whose industries are threatened with loss of raw materials under Priorities .
