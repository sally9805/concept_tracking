" Aye , aye , sir ! " he replied , probably for the first time since he had been a midshipman . I turned back to the hammock on which Ben lay , bending again to look at that shattered right leg . It was bad , I could see , but aside from lacerations it was actually no worse than the leg I had set for Noandiah Hethcote that day in the shipyardat Salem . Perhaps if I had followed Dr. Wells 's advice it would have been better , for Ben 's seafaring days would have been over . But I felt that I could save his legs , and be it Ben or another , it was a sort of pride in me to try . I will not go into details . It took four bleedings and Marshalland three loblolly boys to hold hint down while I set the breaks , one by one , in both legs and the mashed foot and bound them up in splints to hold them in place . Ben screamed and cursed and fought me as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a wooden plug between his teeth to wedge his jaws wide and hold them . When I was done I knocked the plug out and grinned at him . " There , " I said . " One leg may turn out shorter than the other , but at least they 'll be your own . " For answer he cursed me ! Well , I did not look for thanks from him ! This was the end of my troubles , at least for the duration of that cruise . I can not say that Ben ever showed the least sign of gratitude to me for having saved his legs , and Dr. Wells was critical , saying that the greatest mark of skill in a naval surgeon was the neatness and dispatch with which he performedan amputation . Nevertheless I was well pleased with myself . I had kept my resolution . I had resisted the temptation to take vengeance upon an enemy whom chance had placed within my reach . I had preserved her man for Patience . And I had given myself a sense of strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had secured for myself the first real moments of peace that I had known in almost a year . It was June beforeBen was able to lay aside his crutches , and it was August and we were back again within the Capes of Virginia and standing up Chesapeake Bay toward the Potomac before he was able to walk , without support , albeit with a pronounced limpP201which he kept from then on . On that day I spoke to him for the first time during the voyage . " Well , Ben , " I said , " ' twill be good to see the streets of Salem again , eh ? " He turned upon me savagely . " What makes you think I 'm going back ? " he snarled . " I mean to take you , " I said grimly . " Make no mistake about that . " Nor had he the strength to protest . What he thought I meant to do after fetching him home I neither knew nor cared . I felt confident that he would give me little trouble in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of August and started north on the following day . As for the Essex , she was laid up in ordinary . WE CAME to Salem by afternoon stage from Boston , quietly and unheralded , and if any noticed our arrival they gave no sign of it . I left my luggage at the stage station and delivered Ben to his own door , determined that nothing should now interfere with these final stages of my self-imposed duty . I did not , however , approach the house , not trusting myself to face Patience . Now all at once I was faced with my own problem . What should I do now ? Where should I go ? In my single-minded determination it had not occurred to me to consider my own situation . Now , however , it came to me with full force that my own affairs were scarcely in better shape than Ben 's . I was unwilling to remain in Salem , yet it had long since come to me that I owed it to Selina to hear what she might have to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least ready to concede so much . Accordingly , I now turned my steps in the direction of the Hackett house . The place seemed oddly quiet as I approached . The tall windows still stared blankly out at the street . The lawns and gardens were , as usual , carefully trimmed and cared for . The veranda was neat and spotless , and the steps had been freshly painted . Yet there was something subtly different . I lifted the great brass knocker and listened to the echoes reverberating through the hall within . Presently I heard steps , and a moment later found myself face to face with Sukey , Selina 's maid . " Good evening , Sukey , " I said . For answer her eyes flew wide and her jaw dropped , quite as if she had seen a grave open and give forth its dead . Insteadof replying she turned away suddenly , blubbering , and scurried back into the house . I followed , puzzled , and went into the drawing room , confidentthat in due time Selina would learn of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a step on the thresholdand turned to find old Jeremy Cotton , who had been CaptainHackett 's chief clerk , facing ; Inc across the threshold . " Good evening , Jeremy , " I said . " Is Mrs. Tisdall at home ? " He gave me an odd look and cleared his throat . " Er  --  welcome home , Doctor , " he said . " I 'm afraid I 've sorry news for you . " What ? " I said , not realizing . " Why  --  er , " he said , obviously groping . " Why  --  uh  --  fact is , Doctor , you must n't take it hard . Things are n't as you left ' cm . " " Come , come , man ! " I exclaimed . " Out with it ! I 'd not expectedeverything to be exactly the same . " He looked about him wildly and , seeing no escape , came to the point . " Miss Selina 's dead ! " " What ? " I gasped , thunderstruck . I think I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dead ! " he repeated . " No ! " I exclaimed . " Over a year now , " he assured me . I felt my knees go weak beneath me , and I fumbled for a chair . She had been alive , vital , when I left , and much as I told myself I had resented her behavior , I had not considered this : that she could be gone , cold dead , no more to laugh , to smile , to preen her lovely , voluptuous body . " Tell mc , " I gasped . He gave me a pitying glance , as if he would help me . " ' T was but a day or two after you left , " he said . " We tried to find you , and only then learned you were gone . "  | " How ? " I demanded fiercely . " Drowned , " he replied . " She went out in the little pinnace that used to he her father 's . There was a squall and she drove on the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore of Great Misery the next day . " I felt a chill in my heart . " But she was a stout swimmer , " I protested , " and a better sailor . She 'd never go out when weather was making ! " " That 's what everyone said , " he nodded . " But she did . " I made no reply . Presently he came and put his hand upon my shoulder . " I 'm sorry , Doctor , " he said , " to be the one to bring you such news . You have my deepest sympathy ! " I nodded absently , thanking him , and he went away . How long I sat there brooding I do not know , but it was long past dark when I finally went upstairs . I have seen ships , caught suddenly aback by an abrupt shift of the wind , stagger and lose their rigging and all but founder in the heavy seas . In a sense I found myself in a like predicament . The regard for personalities ; the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a man ; the bond of affectionate friendship , I believe , is never totally obliterated between individuals no matter what quarrels may have come between them . Once established , a vestige of it always remains , so that even though one has come to regard a former friend or lover or close associate with hatred , the sudden news of disaster to such a one comes with a sharp shock . This was my own reaction to the news of Selina 's death . I had not wished her such ill as this ! Was 1 , my conscience demanded , responsible ? Even if I could say " no " to that with assurance , I could not forget the life we had led together , the love we had known for one another . She was my wife . We had shared our bed and bodies . If we were not combined in one person , it was not for lack of opportunity . It was merely fortunate in the circumstances . But I was in no mood to consider the circumstances . I could only think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what she had been to me  --  not of what I had thought her at our last parting . For all my bitterness , I found , I had still great regard for her , and the thought that she , whom I had once held close to my heart , whose throbbing , pulsing life I had felt beating against my own , was now gone , dead , inaccessible to any human feeling , was one that left me with a sense of selfloathing , a feeling almost of physical illness , at the way we had parted . Was I wrong ? I kept asking myself . Had I done her an injustice ? Was there something more in the situation I had discovered that I did not understand ? I tried to assure myself that there could be no explanation for what I had seen and that I had acted only as a sensible man would . Yet the feeling persisted , and the question would raise itself in my mind in the small hours of the night , when I thought myself free of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was long before I was able to force myself to look upon it objectively . Indeed , if truth he told , I was never able to reach that state of mind entirely . But the passage of time helped to deaden the shock , and it was only then that I was able to take stock of matters as they now stood . Those matters , I may say , needed stocktaking . By virtue of the tragedy I found myself the sole heir to all of the fortune and business that Eli Hackett had amassed . All the ships , the wharves , the warehouses and all the goods stored in them ; the great house on Derby Street and everything in it , even the servants , were mine , and I found myself faced suddenly with the tyranny of possessions . There are those , I know , who will envy me what they consider my good fortune , but for my own part I would gladly have given up all claim to any of it if in so doing I could return Selina to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to accept . And in accepting I wound myself more tightly in a web that I was striving desperately to escape . That web was fundamentally Salem , or so it seemed to me . I felt that Salem was at , the root of all that had happened . If I had not gone there in the first place , Patience would neverhave married Ben Price , for it was I who had brought himinto her house . By the same token , if I had not gone to Salem , Selina might yet be living and happy . This was false reasoning , I admit , but in my state of mind then I was unable torecognize its fallacy . The fact was I had come to Salem andmet the woman I loved . She had married another , and overp205the wreckage of that love I had built another . That , too , had crashed , with disastrous results . There was nothing left for me in Salem but memories and wealth . And while the wealth tied me in the town , my memories made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shake its dust from my feet . I wanted to get away , to where I might find action and forget all that had happened . I wanted to forget Selina and my feeling of having been responsible for her tragedy . I wanted to forget Patience , whom I still loved but could never possess . I wanted to wash my hands of Ben Price , and of all that he stood for . Yet now that I had my wife 's inheritance I seemed as firmly tied to the place as if I had raised a family there . There was one difference , however . In the situation as it was , I could dispose of my inheritance . And once I had disposed of it I would no longer be bound to remain . I could sell the property and go . Nor need I ever return . This I determined to do before I made any other decision . I think I had some notion that this might be accomplished in a week , or a fortnight at the latest . I was quickly to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were interruptionsto the business of stocktaking and disposal . My neighbors were kindly and called to express their sympathy , none knowing , of course , the things that had passed between us before my last abrupt departure , which to them had merely the look of rejoining my ship . In kindness I could only accept their expressionsas they were intended , and thank them . Nor could I hurry their departure . In the first weeks , too , I found that my own state of mind prevented long concentration upon business matters , though this gradually wore away . " Then , too , there were my old patients , who , now that " the doctor " had returned , came back to him to treat their ills . Here again , in the name of decency , I found it impossible to turn them away . I treated them , and they returned with friends with other ills to cure . Thus , while with one hand I sought to cut the bonds that linked me to the town , with the other , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But it took me less than a week to discover that the actual business of disposal of my inheritance formed the greatest block to my swift departure . For the first time I was brought face to face with the extent of my father-in-law 's interests , and the ramifications and far-flung complications amazed me . It was more than a matter of selling a few ships and warehouses in Salem . I discovered that there were properties in England and Italy , in the Low Countries , and in the Indies as well . There were contracts and credits with foreign agents , and bills of exchange on practically every port in Europe . The task was made lighter by Jeremy Cotton , who had kept things in order in my absence and had carried on the business in the way he felt Captain Hackett would have done had he been there . It was he who showed me what a maze it was , and it was primarily he who carried through the business of disposal , although I felt he disapproved of this solution and kept hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was midwinter  --  agood six months  --  before we had squared away our foreign accounts . And it was April before I managed to sell out the business itself , lock , stock , and barrel , ships , warehouses , and goods , to the Crowninshields , leaving me only the house and its contents yet to dispose of . It was turned June before I was able to strike a bargain on that with Peleg Taylor , who had lately made a successful China cruise and now sought a home to which he might fetch his bride of a month . It was nearer a year , therefore , than a fortnight , before I was at last free to go my way . In the meantime I avoided all such social contact as I might . I kept myself to myself , as much as it was possible to do . And yet it was not possible to become a hermit altogether . Church was still compulsory in Salem , morally if not by law , and town meeting was likewise not to be neglected . And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another I felt bound to attend , and my appearanceat these , no doubt , kept me from gaining the reputationof a complete recluse . At that , I have no doubt , my fellowtownsfolk came to look on me as slightly " odd " since my wife 's death , but the great majority were understanding , or , what amounts to the same thing , they thought they were . Above all I sought to avoid contact with Patience and Ben . In so far as Ben was concerned , I felt that our return to Salem had established a tacit truce between us . Apparently he had accepted it as such , for I saw him , now and again , about town , frequently under the influence of liquor . Yet we never spoke.  |p207I  saw no reason why I should either stir up his enmity or pretend to his friendship . Patience , on the other hand , I avoided for reasons far more difficult to explain . In the first place , the feeling that I had made a fool of myself on our last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second place , I had no wish to revive my old feeling for her  --  which I knew underneath everything to be as strong as ever . Added to this was a feeling that my interference at this time might well be misunderstood . During our absence Patience had become a mother again ; a daughter this time . Yet , on the occasions on which I saw her , in church and at town meeting , I could not see that it had affected her beauty . She was still as young and as fresh seeming , as firm breasted and as youthfully rounded as ever . And what was more , she held her head as high . I was far from sure that I had been instrumental in bringing her happiness . But at least I had done my best , and I avoided her lest I learn that my efforts had been in vain . Yet it was impossible to avoid her entirely . On public occasions , as at those mentioned , we must at least meet and nod . And there were other moments , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with her returning from market . In the circumstances I could not refuse to carry her basket or talk to her as we walked ! " You 've been a stranger , " she said accusingly . " I 've been busy , " I replied shortly . She eyed me sidelong , under her lashes . " I 'm dreadfully sorry , " she said quietly . I made no reply . I believe we both were thinking of the last time I had seen her . In time I spoke in desperation . " How 's Ben ? " I asked . " Well , thank you , " she replied . I thought I caught a derisive undertone to her reply . " Look here , " I blurted , " I found Ben aboard the Essex . And by the time I 'd found him I 'd had time to think . I  --  I changed my mind . " " God hears our prayers , " she replied simply . " Yes , " I said curtly , not altogether understanding , " though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no reply to that , and we walked on in silence . Out of the corner of my eye I could not but notice that she seemed to be fighting back tears . I felt some of the old yearning stirring within me , and when we came to her gate I hastily handed her the basket and bade her good-by . Early in June , as I was preparing to turn over the house to Captain Taylor , I received two official-looking envelopes , one from Washington , bearing the stamp of the Secretary of the Navy , the other from Philadelphia , with the signature of Captain Bainbridge . The first was an order : You will proceed to Philadelphia it said and report to the Frigate Philadelphia for duty as surgeon 's mate . If fin any reason you find yourselfunable to comply with these orders , you will communicate with the Secretary of the Navy by the first post , giving your reasons therefor , or submit your resignation from the Naval service without delay . This was a grim reminder that I was still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not offer you the post of surgeon it said , as times have changed , and a captain no longer has the naming of those who sail under him . But I am given to understand you have been designated as surgeon 's mate aboard the Philadelphia , and remembering your late services aboard the Essex , I hasten to assure you that I would rather sail with no man . Should you care to join us again , I will be pleased of your company . Should you wish to decline the service , I would appreciate it if you would let me know at the earliest possible date , in order that I might fill your place with someone , less desirable , perhaps , but equally necessary to our purpose . It was signed William Bainbridge , Captain , U.S.N.There was something heart-warming about this , and I set it aside , to answer presently . Since I was quitting Salem , and had no other plan , I saw no reason why I should decline . Indeed it seemed an easy solution to the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later I surrendered the house to Captain Taylor and his bride and , with my money in my pocket and my sea bag on my shoulder , took myself to the Eagle Tavern to find lodging for the night and to lay my plans . There I was greeted by Matt Turner , who assured me that they had room and would be glad to accommodate me . It was when he had seen my fire lit and the rooms warmed that he turned to me . " I wondered when you 'd be calling back for your chest , " he said . " Shall I have it fetched up ? "  | " Chest ? " I said . It had slipped my mind . Then all at once I remembered . " Oh yes , " I said . " By all means , do . " Within a few moments the boy appeared with the dusty , long-forgotten box on his shoulder . " Put it down , " I said , gesturing toward the corner of the room . He did as I told him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little attention to it . Presently , however , having a few moments before it was time to go down to supper , I opened it , unable to recall in any detail what I had packed away in it two years and more ago . As a matter of fact , there seemed little in it of interest . I found some shirts , two coats , several pair of pantaloons , a few surgical books and papers and a treatise on bleeding , a set of rusty scalpels , a pair of gloves , and a razor which my wife had given me . Still , I thought , there was no use letting good clothing rot , and I went to work to hang up the coats and pantaloons , which were still quite serviceable . As I took out the top one and shook it out for the hanger , a sheaf of papers fell from it and fluttered to the floor in zigzagswoops . Most of them were receipted bills or penciled notes  --  once urgent , now dead as yesterday 's newsletter . One , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way and that and then skated across the floor and under the bed . I got down on my knees and gathered up the papers , retrievingthe envelope under the bed last . All were familiar but that one , and as I got to my feet I turned it over and over in my hands , looking at it and wondering what it contained . It was sealed , and addressed to me in a small hand , and I wondered why it had not been opened . Then slowly it came to me . I remembered my host fetching it to me , on the night of my departure ; how I had told him to put it on the bed  --  that I would read it later . I even remembered now packing those papers away in that especial spot . I must have gathered it up with the rest , I told myself , and packed it away . Well , it could not be helped now . I might as well see what was in it . Incuriously , I slit it open and spread it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I dare not address you as beloved for fear you will tear this up unread . I know you would hear the least detail of the least quarrel between thep2I0 least of your slaves before you would judge them . Then , hear , I beg you , the plea of your adoring wife . My dearest one ! Please read this to the end . If after that you still feel as you now do , then I know what I must do . No blame shall be attached to you for it ! It would be simple for me to say that he forced me ; that what you saw was not what it must have seemed to you . I have thought of it from your viewpoint , and I can see how it must be to you . Yet that is the plain truth . But there is more behind it . I will come back to that in time . What else there is to say , I feel you must know . Too long this has lain between us , and I must tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe in me . If this fails I have but one course left , loving you as I do . I met Ben Price whilst I was visiting a cousin in Boston . He was then a student at Harvard  --  and not doing well . I was as giddy then as I have always been . le was handsome . I thought myself attractive . We were attracted to one another ; not spiritually , as I have been to you , and I hope you have been to me , you understand , but purely in a physical way . I managed to resist him during my stay in Boston , and so preserved my chastity  --  does n't it seem silly that I ever had any ? Oh God , I am an evil woman ! But if you will only love me , Tom , I can mend my ways and be yours alone ! But to get back to my story ; when he failed at Harvard , but a few weeks later , Ben followed me to Salem . He called on me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times  --  which I was still sufficiently virgin to resent . I saw my danger , and I realized his attraction for me . I told him that he would never have me but by marriage , and that he scoffed at . I called on Captain Webb , who was an old friend , and told him that I would never be free of this man until he was removed from my neighborhood . I know what Captain Webb thought , but I did not care . I was afraid . And so I arranged with Captain Webb to carry him off in his ship  --  and at that point you stepped in . You found him where Captain Webb 's men had dropped him , alarmed at your approach . You saved his life and brought him back to health . And when we met that day upon the street it seemed to me that this was a thing I could not combat . I thought then destiny had singled me out for him  --  a woman likes to be pursued . It is flattering to her vanity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means to rouse him to the marrying stage ! But that was before I knew you , my sweet ! You know something of what followed . I thought to play you against him , hoping to force him to me . Instead he married the Nowell girl , purelyp211out of spite for me , I am still convinced . Then , to show him that it meant nothing to me , I turned to you , flaunting you in his face as much as I could , never thinking , my darling , what I might be doing to you in the process ! I taunted him , little fool that I was , and he rose , as I thought , to the bait . Actually , I was the one that rose . On our picnics he had me . It did not occur to me that I was the victim of our game . I thought , with peculiarconceit , that I was but showing him what he had lost in marrying another . Then I discovered my condition and knew that I , not he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that I trapped you , my beloved . I admit it now . You see , my sweet , I did not know you then as I do now . That only came later . I trapped you , and you found me out and left me , and it was only then , darling , that I suddenly appreciated your worth and all that you meant to me . I saw you as the equal of dozens of Ben Prices , and when you came back to me  --  darling , my cup was full as only the cup of a woman loving and beloved can be full ! I knew that I was not alone in your heart . But I was content with a tiny corner of it , that seemed to me to be growinglarger . I was a faithful wife to you , my dearest , from that day , and even before . I know you may sneer at that . Yet it is but the simple truth . I had not seen Ben , except in your company or Father 's , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to . I love you , my darling , no other ! But Thursday he came to the house , after you had gone , all smiles and most gracious , and said that he must see me about this office you are building . He teased me along , saying we must put our heads together to give you a surprise , so that it would be something more than you had expected . Naturally I fell in with this , and he fetched out plans and started to show them to me . I leaned over them , and it was then that he seized me in his arms before I could protest . He had his one aria about me , holdingme , and with his other hand he tore my dress down the front . I would have cried out , but he bent me backward and kissed me so that I could not open my mouth . I reached up and caught his ears and cheeks and tried to push his face away  --  and that was the moment at which you entered ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know upon what I can swear to you that you will believe , and yet it is true !  --  it is true ! Ben Price I hate . I would see him hanged and not lift a finger in his defense ! But you , my dearest one , I adore , and rather then endure your evil opinion I will do away with myself . I have been far from perfect . In fact I have been deeply blameworthy . If you can find it in your heart to forgive me , then life 's cup for me will be filled to overflowing and God 's face will shine upon me ! If you do not , then I can not bear to live !  |p2I2  I do not mean this as a threat . I do not seek to force you . If you do not believe what I have written here  --  which is God 's truth  --  ignore me . I shall not fear to die , having lost you . What is life ? I shall wait three days for your answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry more about me . Ever your most adoring wife , SELINA I THINK there is nothing in this world so bitter as the knowledge that we have done an injustice for vhid ) we can not make amends . The impact of Selina 's last letter can be imagined ! Had I not been careless , had I read the letter , 1 would certainly have agreed to talk with her ; I might even have been convinced . I3y overlooking it I had condemned her to death ! That , at least , was how I felt . I did not now question her . The facts were too neatly aligned to leave any doubt in my mind . No ! I had killed her . Worse ! I had killed her and she was innocent of the crime of which I had accused her ! As I read the letter a desperate sort of numbness settled upon me , and when I had finished it I sat for God alone knows how long , staring at it between my fingers , with a sense of horror that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read again , piecing out the phrases and the sentences , slowly , lest I might have misunderstood them . And as the realization of their unequivocal meaning came home to me I began to feel a sensation of self-disgust that was physical in its violence . My gorge rose within me , and I fought against gagging nausea like a man drunk and fighting for breath . Then , when this first wave of retching passed , I sat numbed in mind and body , unable to think , unable to move ; able only to stare dully at my hands and the paper in them , thinking her name over and over again . I have no more idea now than I had then how long I sat so , crushed by the horror of the news and stricken with the enormity of my crime . As I sat the daylight faded and darkness fell , and after a time there came Matt Turner , rapping at my door and asking if I would not be down to sup.  |p213I  did not at first hear him . Indeed , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of him until he became alarmed at my lack of response and rattled at the latch , crying out : " Are you all right sir ? Is aught amiss ? " " Go away ! " I replied dully . But this he would not do until he had satisfied himself about me . Ile opened the door and thrust his head into the room , eying me curiously through the twilight gloom . " Do ye not intend to sup , Doctor ? " he asked . " If ye wish , I 'll have ye served here in your room . " His eyes missed no detail of the scene , dusky though it was , and they raked across me and the open chest and the crumpled letter in my hand . " Is there aught  --  can I do anything , Doctor ? " " No ! No ! " I rasped impatiently . " Go away and leave me be . I 've no appetite . " It was rude , I own , but I was not in a state to remember my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something , then closed it again with an angry snap and drew back . " Very good , sir ! " he said , and shut the door . This passage is , in itself , indicative of my state of mind , for in the ordinary course of things , I think , I am rather overly inclined to courtesy than the opposite . However , it served to rouse me . When he was gone I stirred uneasily , and presently , rising , lit a candle and reread the letter . In that rereading , while I lost none of my anger at myself , it seemed to me that if anyone was more to blame than I , it was Ben ! ' rice . Through the whole sorry business he had flitted like an evil ghost . Each fresh turn of tragedy had stemmed directly from his spite . His marriage to Patience and his subsequent continuing pursuit of Selina ; her shame , her heartbreak , even her death were all the results of his vindictiveness . His endless demand for payment for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he himself could suffer if he lived a thousand years ! It was not right , I told myself , that he should be the cause of all this and yet go untouched himself . Let him see what he had done ! Let him read this letter ! Let him know what his selfishnessand vanity had brought about ! Show him what kind of stain he carried now upon his immortal soul , whether he liked or no ! After that , if he could still smirk and sneer -- Well ,  | after that I had no plan , only a sort of a dull fury . After thatWell , we would see . But first my one thought was to show him the results of his handiwork . I folded the letter carefullyand put it in my pocket . After that I picked up my hat and went out . In the dark street I turned in the direction of the Nowell house . There I found no light outside the door , but I knocked , and a moment later Patience opened to me . " Why , Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I thought was somewhat forced gaiety . " You 've been such a stranger , what brings you here tonight ? " I was in no mood for jocularity . " Where 's Ben ? " I demanded curtly . She hesitated , glanced at me , and then stood aside . " Come in , " she said . I entered , following her into the familiar great room , where she went to stand with her back to the fireplace , almost defiantly , facing mc . " What do you want ? " she asked . " Where 's Ben ? " I repeated doggedly . " What do you want of him ? " she demanded firmly . " I have something here I think he should see , " I said . " What is it ? " It came to me that she too had a right to know . Silently I handed her the letter . She took it hesitantly and began to read , then , after scanning the opening lines , shook her head . " But " she began . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In silence then she obeyed . When she was done she glanced up at me with a sharp little indrawn breath . " Oh , Tom  --  no ! " she exclaimed . I nodded toward the letter . " You see what it says , " I replied . She dropped her eyes to the paper once more , horrified . Then , all at once , I saw her frown slightly . " But  --  but , " she said , looking up at me again with a puzzled stare , " I do n't understand . This date As calmly as I could I explained to her what had happened : how the letter had come for me whilst I was packing ; how I had told Turner to leave it with the other papers upon thep215bed ; and how , at the last , I had inadvertently packed it with- ' out reading it , and only now had come upon it . As she listened her face drained white . When I had done she gave a little cry . " Oh , Tom ! How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame myself ? " I replied bitterly . " I should have read it . Even without reading it I should have known  --  I should at least have listened ! " " It was that night you came looking for him ? " I nodded . " You frightened me ! " she said . " I did n't kill him on your account , " I told her . " It seemed more fitting to fetch him back ; to force him to keep the bargainhe made with you . I thought you 'd want it that way . " She smiled a little bitterly . " You think life with me a punishment ? " " I did n't mean that ! " I cried . " Pat ! I did n't ! If you only knew ! " She looked at me quickly . " If I knew what ? " she asked . I reached out and caught her to me roughly . " I love you ! " I exclaimed . " I 've always loved you . " She did not resist when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an instant she clung to me . Then , gently , she put her hands upon my breast and thrust me back . " No , Tom  --  no ! " she whispered . " Pat , " I protested , " do n't you see ? I is had your love . I could not let him throw it away . If I could not have you , he , at least , could not abandon you ! " " But Selina ? " she asked soberly . " You loved her . " I made a desperate gesture . " Ca n't you see ? " I cried . " I came to love her . But that was after you and Ben were married ! " She looked startled , but I hurried on . " If Ben had made you a good husband , if I had not been such a blinded fool , we might have been happy . But I could never have loved her , Pat , as I have loved you ! " She stared at me dully . " Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt suddenly shamed.  | " Pat ! " I cried . " I mean no harm to her or her memory . Had I known this before I left , it might have made a great difference . But I did not know , Pat ! I knew then only what I have told you . That I loved you , and that he was responsible for everything ! That has n't changed ! He 's still responsible . Where is he , Pat ? " She stared at me as if I were the devil tempting her . " He  --  he 's gone away , " she whispered . " Then come away with me ! " I exclaimed . " Let 's forget him ! He does n't deserve your consideration ! " She turned from me abruptly , resting her head upon the mantelpiece . " Pat ! " I cried , reckless . She waved me away with one hand . " I  --  I ca n't , Tom ! " she said . " You should not ask it ! " " Then tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll follow him and we 'll have this out  --  once and for all ! " She turned about on me with such a look of sudden fear that I was startled . " No  --  Tom , no ! " she cried . " Yes ! " I said . " Tell me  --  or I will find him for Myself ! " She flung herself upon me and clung to me . " No , Tom ! " she cried . " You must n't ! " But I was not to be put off this time . " My dear , " I said , " I made that mistake once . " Gently I disengaged her arms and turned toward the door . But quick as light she was before me , blocking the way . " No , Tom ! " she begged . " Please ! You must not ! For mysake ! " I stopped abruptly . " For your sake ? " I demanded , incredulous . " Can you still say that you love him ? " She fell back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until her back was against the wall , the back of her hand against her mouth , her great blue eyes wide and staring . For an instant I thought she was going to cry out in protest . Then suddenly she seemed to rally and gather strength . She dropped her hand and lifted her head . " Yes ! " she said faintly . " Yes , I love him , and if you kill him you may as well kill me too ! "  |p2I7  " You ca n't mean that ! " I cried . She nodded doggedly . " I do ! Oh , I do ! " she repeated . For a long instant I stared at her , scarcely able to believe my ears . Then at length a sense of unbearable defeat came over me . I turned away . " Very well , " I said . " I sha n't kill him . IIe may go to hell in his own way , for all of me ! " I picked up my hat and went to the door . " Good-by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " I was out the door before she could reply . As I left the house I thought I saw the curtains move at the window . But when I turned about they were hanging motionless , and I turned away and went off in the darkness . IIIp221Now IT MAY SEEM in this that I acted with little resolution , but it should be borne in mind that I had suffered a great shock and that I was as little ready to think matters out for myself as a newborn child is prepared to walk . On top of this , Pat 's statement that she loved Ben still , despite all that he had done , came as an equally staggering blow . It was somehow as though someone I had always trusted had turned against inc . I felt that the last tree in my orchard was blighted , the last structurein the village of my life destroyed , that everything that I had cherished and hoped for and loved now lay in ashes about me . I could think only of getting away . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer had any mind to seek out Ben . I had been honest enough in that . I no longer cared what he did or what became of him . I knew only that I wanted to go . I wanted to run from everything that I had known , and I was fatuous enough to believe it could be done . In these circumstances it was not strange that I should think of the Philadelphia . I already had orders to join her , which I might accept or decline . I had Captain Bainbridge 's letter . If I accepted , within a month or two we would sail for the Mediterranean , with the squadron being sent out to relieve Commodore Morris . A year , perhaps even more , at sea would give me opportunity to settle my thoughts , and at the end of it I would be in a better frame of mind to know what 1 intended to do . Perhaps , even , I might remain in the Navy and make a career for myself there . But I thought little of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . I was near three weeks reaching Philadelphia , for I was content to go by easy stages . At New York I purchased fresh uniforms , to conform with the new regulations , as well as new instruments and texts , and , thus equipped , I reported on board the Philadelphia early in July . My first impressions of the ship were favorable . She had been one of the squadron with which I had sailed in the Essex , on her last cruise to the Mediterranean , but on that occasionp222I had scarcely noticed her , and not once had I availed myself of the opportunity to go on board . Now I found her larger and roomier than the Essex , albeit she was rated but four guns more than Essex 's thirty-two . She was broader of beam and longer of keel , and I looked to find her less crowded , which , so far as I was concerned , she was , since her surgeon 's mates  --  there were three of us  --  had the entire cockpit to themselves and , wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wardroom , too , was more spacious , and the officers ' cabins had a foot or two more space each way . In the berth deck , however , and the steerage , I can not say that there was less crowding , for , while there was correspondingly more room , the larger complement of the ship filled the space and left each man the same room to sling his hammock and each petty and warrant the same small cubby for his use . On reporting on board , I was taken directly to Captain Bainbridge , who welcomed me with the utmost informality . " We 'd begun to fear you were n't coming , " he told me . " You had my letter ? " " Yes sir , " I replied , " only a day or two before I came away . I thought I 'd get here as fast , else I would have written . " " That was logical , " he nodded . " No doubt some of the others have reasoned similarly . " " The others , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote to all officers , warrants , and ratings aboard the Essex . I could n't wish a better lot . " My heart sank within me at the words , for I felt a warning premonition . He thrust the ship 's articles across the table . " Just sign there , Doctor , " he said . I signed , not wishing , at this point , to appear hesitant . Nor did I have time to run my eye down the long list of those who had already signed before me . " Have many returned ? " I asked . He shook his head . " Not many . There 's Mr. Smith and Mr. Henry . And there are a number among the foremast hands . " He did not mention Ben , and so I thought no more of it . But I was no more than settled in and on my way forward to report to Dr. Ridgely for duty , when I came upon him fitting up partitions in the petty officers ' mess.  |p223At  sight of him I came to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at almost the same instant . For the space of a minute we must have stared at one another in surprise and disgust . At length it was he who grated : " What brings you here ? " The words snapped something within me , and I began to curse . I am not one who holds that an officer may behave as he wills to the foremast people . I have always deplored the tendency . But now I had no thought for that . I cursed him with every foul word and name I knew , and when I had done with that I told him that I had no mind to follow him , that I would be as pleased if I never saw him again , and that if he would leave me alone it should be truce between us . " You may go to hell and be damned to you , for all of me , " I remember saying . " I 've no interest in anything you do or seek to do . All I ask is to be shut of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may you find bad luck in the way of it ! " " And the same to you ! " he sneered , and that , for then , was the end of it . My other shipmates I found , with few exceptions , congenial . Most of them were new to me , but Ben Smith , our third lieutenant , had sailed with us in the Essex , as had Bernard Henry , one of the midshipmen . Timothy Winn , who had been purser of the Essex , was also expected to join us , but at the last momentwe heard he was shifted to the Argus , and his place was taken by Keith Spence , a stout , amiable , fair-faced young man who I have no doubt carried out his duties in an equally efficientmanner . For the rest I could find few with whom to quarrel . John S. H. Cox was first lieutenant , a veteran of considerable service , having entered the Navy as midshipman in ' 98 . He was a quiet man  --  which a first luff should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More fiery was our second luff , Mr. Jacob Jones , who also had long service to his credit . Theodore Hunt completed the roster of our deck officers , as fourth lieutenant ; a quiet , unassuming young gentleman fresh from the steerage and without outstanding characteristics . Of closer interest to me were the members of the surgical staff . John Ridgely was our surgeon : a tall , spare man , handsomein a lean way , with humorous brown eyes and chestnutp224hair and a manner of listening politely to anything the least of his subordinates might have to say , as if he valued our judgment . He was a native of Philadelphia and a thoroughly able physician . He was also an accomplished and cultured gentleman . Unfortunately for us all , his health was poor . Jonathan Cowdery , surgeon 's first mate and my immediate superior , was a man of different stamp . He was a small , rather pompous person , exceedingly vain and touchy ; fiery with those he could outface , but rather fawning to his superiors . He had black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine hands . He was competent both in physic and surgery , and of all the ship 's cornpanyhe might best feel at home in the Philadelphia , for in several years of service he had never served aboard another ship . The third member of our cockpit crew was Nicholas Harwood , surgeon 's third mate , a gangling youngster fresh from the classrooms and operating theater of the Philadelphia College . He was a protege of Ridgely 's : a shy , retiring , somewhatmyopic boy , but one I judged to have great promise once he had forgotten his book learning and absorbed a little of practical apprenticeship . With these shipmates I looked forward to a satisfying , if uneventful , cruise . At least the companionshipwould be reasonably congenial , and if we saw little in the way of action , that would be no more than past experiencehad led me to expect . We cleared from Philadelphia on the eighteenth of July , and within the week were well outside the Capes of the Delaware , breasting the long Atlantic rollers with the porpoises playing under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our crossing to Gibraltar was swift since we had , in the main , fair winds and fine weather . In the course of it ship and crew shook down a working unit that performed as a single entity to the brazen lungs of Mr. Jones or the more modulated commands of Mr. Cox . Scant five weeks after our departure from Philadelphia found us at the Rock . Our anchor had scarcely found holding when the consul 's boat fetched out to us news of two Tripoline corsairs , said to be cruising in the vicinity of the Cape de Gatt . We lost no time in questions , but cleared with the followingdawn , and , after a sidelong glance into Te'tuan , stood offfp225northeastward toward the Andalusian coast and the tawny , snow-capped ridges of the Sierra Nevada . We did not find our Tripolines . Indeed , I doubt if they ever existed . However , in the dusk of the second evening , rounding the snout of the Cape de Gatt , we fell in with the Moorish cruiser Mirboka , twenty-two guns , belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Tangier . A little distance away , and yet clearly in company with the cruiser , was a brig of unmistakably American build . Although , so far as we knew , we were at peace with the Moors , few of us had any reason to regard them with trust . Accordingly , we rounded to and hailed the cruiser , which , after some effort to ignore us , at length responded in barely understandableEnglish . In the gathering dark , it seemed , Lubarez took us for an English frigate , and we saw no reason to disillusionhim . By this ruse we discovered that the brig was the Celia , of Boston , which , Lubarez said , had sailed under his protection from Barcelona . The story had a false ring , and before the Moor could protestwe had an armed party on his deck . Ten minutes sufficed to bring to light the captain of the Celia and several of his crew from the hold where they had been confined after their capture by the Mirboka . Peace or war , this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought on board the Philadelphia , and a prize crew , under Lieutenant Cox , placed on board the Moor , with orders to fetch her into Gibraltar . We then set out in pursuit of the brig , which was making off in the dark , and , coming up with her , seized her also without ceremony . Lubarez protested at first that he meant no harm to the American vessel but merely sought to protect her . When he perceived that this would not do , he stated that he had taken her on his own cognizance . But when Bainbridge threatened him and all of his men with short shrift at the yardarm as a parcel of scurvy pirates , he produced a license from the Emperor , through the governor of Tangier , to seize and make prize any and all American vessels he might encounter on the seas . We carried our prizes in to Gibraltar , where I believe the British were none too pleased to see us . It was hinted that , Britain being at peace with Morocco , we must take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbaric Majesty . As if to emphasize their point , the commanders of the several British line-of-battle ships in the harbor proceeded to enroll certain deserters from our crew and to impress others from the prize crew of the Mirboka , under the pretext that they were , in spite of their sworn records , British subjects . Nor was the atmosphere ashore , between British and Americanofficers , cordial . As a result our visit was marked with tension and ill feeling . Fortunately we had not long to wait . The other ships of our squadron arrived by ones and twos . On 12 September came Commodore Preble , in the Constitution , from Boston , while two days later arrived Commodore Morris , in the New York , and Commodore Rodgers , in the John Adams , from the eastward . After that we lay in the uncomfortable atmosphere of three broad pendants , while the three commodores eyed one another with veiled jealousy . In this interval of waiting Lieutenant David Porter came on board from the New York , to replace Lieutenant Cox , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisionshould be reached as to the disposition of that vessel . Porter was a man of whom we had already heard more than a little , for despite his youth  --  he was but twenty-three  --  he had long since made a name for himself . He proved to be a slight , wiry man , with crinkly , unruly brown hair above a highdomedforehead , large agate-hard black eyes , thin lips , and a nose and chin that seemed to draw down to point in the same , simultaneous direction . He seemed to me to have the strut and temper and the pugnacity of a fighting cock . Some who saw him had misgivings , and the crew was unhappy , for his reputation as a disciplinarian and a fire-eater , they were sure , forecast trouble . But to my way of thinking he was a cut above Mr. Cox , who , though a gentleman to the core , struck me as lacking driving force . All of this , of course , actually concerned me little . As one of the surgical staff , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck , yet I watched the transposition with aloof amusement . It was diverting to see the way the midshipmenp227scurried about beneath the eye of this bantam rooster . Lacking second sight , I could not know the part that he was to play in my own life . Yet I must confess that from the moment I laid eyes upon him I was , in some indefinable way , drawn to him . On the eighteenth of September we sailed , in company with the Vixen , to the blockade of Tripoli . I have no mind here to go into the details of our voyage thither . It was uneventful . On the third of October we reached Malta . On the seventh we arrived off the gray coast of Barbary , where we cruised up and down and on and off and back and forth before the tawny , dun-colored forts and gleaming white cupolas and minarets of Tripoli for what seemed endlessdays , without so much as a sail venturing out to meet us . On the nineteenth , however , an Imperial brig , bound up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Regency were out in search of prey . At once Captain Bainbridge dispatchedthe Vixen to westward , to Cape Bon , considering that to be the most likely point at which to fall in with them , while the Philadelphia continued on her blockading station . Three days later there came up a very heavy gale out of the northwest , which drove us far to the eastward . It was more than a week before we could regain our station and see the terraced walls of Tripoli , rising step by step from the water 's edge to the desert behind . By that time the entire Tripoline Navy might have put to sea , for all we knew . It was a fine bright day as we approached , running in from the east before a brisk wind . The northwesterly gale seemed to have cleared the haze that until a week ago had dimmed the outlines of the coast and softened the rocky barrenness of the land . As we swept along we could make out every rock and gully , every bush and hollow on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert plateau behind . I Icrc and there a cluster of native huts huddled amid a scattering of palms , their color blending with the background of the earth . More conspicuous were the frequent little domed tombs , or marabewts , scattered here and there against the hillside , standing out like white stars in a dusty sky in their gleaming coats of whitewash . There was a tingling freshness and sparkle in the air , not often encountered in those latitudes , that reminded me of late summer weather along our own New England coast . It was the last day of October . I We were within five leagues of the city when the lookout 's cry of " Sail ho ! " sent a flame of excitement stabbing through the ship . Mr. Porter was on deck . At the cry he came about with feet widespread , bracing himself to the slight roll of the ship , his head thrown back . " Where away ? " " Broad on the larboard quarter , sir ! " came the reply , driftingdown in a long-drawn-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? " " She 's a Turk , from the rig of her , sir , standing close alongshore , making for harbor , I sh'ld say . " From where I had been basking in the sunshine in the lee of the companionway , I joined the rush to the bulwarks to catch a glimpse of the stranger . Mr. Porter leaped for the shrouds and trained his glass upon her . As the frigate rose to a long swell we made her out , long and low and levantine rigged , a ship under full press of sail , scurrying along the shore , apparently in the hope of making port before we should sight her . Mr. Porter leaped down as lightly as a cat , and even before his feet touched the deck he was bawling orders . " All hands the watch ! Lay aloft ! Look alive ! Up helm , there  --  two points to larboard . That 's it ! Hold her so ! Steady as she goes ! " The rigging swarmed with men , scrambling up the ratlines . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twittered . Commands were caught up from the deck and flung upward and outward . On the gun deck I heard the drum begin to roll . Overhead the reefs shook out of the courses . Topsails and topgallants , and the royals and skysails cascaded from their yards . There was the rumbling thunder of canvas filling with wind . The sails bellied and drew taut . The ship shuddered and then leaped ahead , the foam creaming out to either side from her bows , the spray flying , not wallowing over the rollers now , but knifing sharply through them . Behind me I heard Captain Bainbridge 's voice addressing Mr. Porter quietly . " What do you have , Mr. Porter ? " I had not heard him come on deck , and I scurried for the lee rail , where I belonged . As I went I heard Porter 's reply . " She 's a levantine of some sort making up for port , sir . She 's well armed . I 'd say she was one of their cruisers . "  |p229The  captain accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lowered the telescope a grim smile of satisfaction wreathed his florid features . " I think you 're right , Mr. Porter , " he said . " Can we head her off ? " Mr. Jones put in a doubtful comment . " She has a good start of us . " " We 'll have a try for it , sir , " said Porter , ignoring the interruption . " Do so ! " said the captain . " Aye , aye , sir ! " Captain Bainbridge swung for another look at the enemy , who , having observed that we had seen him , was now crowding on all sail in a desperate effort to slip inside us . After studying him closely he swung his glass along the shore toward the town and then , lowering it , scanned the water between us and the chase and then that between the Philadelphia and the port . " Put leadsmen in the chains , Mr. Porter , " he said . " I should n't like to go aground at this speed . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear here . We 've deep water now . " In a moment , however , the leads were flashing in the air and splashing far ahead , and the singsong cries of the leadsmen drifted back along the deck . " By the ma-a-ark ten !  --  And a half ten ! " " Plenty of water so far , " Bainbridge remarked . " Aye , sir , " replied Jones , " but we 'll have some ( lodging to do before we come up with her . Mark how she weaves . " " I wish the Vixen were here , " Bainbridge said almost querulously . " She has the draft for this sort of work . What does she log , Mr. Jones ? " The chip log was cast and showed a speed of eight and a half knots . I could not help thinking that the Essex would show half again as much . Still , in a vessel as large as the Philadelphia it seemed as though we were fairly flying . As we came into shoreward waters we too were forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in spite of this we managed to gain slightly . We were not successful , however , in cutting the Turk off from the harbor . While we were yet better than a half a league from him he slipped inside us , and from that point it became a stern chase . He had the advantage of knowing his water , and made full use of it . Nevertheless , by eleven o'clock we had gained upon him sufficiently to use our bow chasers . He immediatelyran up the Tripoline colors , and we fired again . Each time the long twelves thundered it was as if the frigate were struck a blow on the bows , for she seemed to stumble and shudderfrom the recoil , and the acrid smoke made a dense white cloud , through which we rushed as if impatient to see the results . Each time , too , we had the disappointment of seeing the plume of spray fall short of the mark by long yards . By noon it became apparent that we would never be able to overtake her before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Already we were within a league of the harbor and still she was beyond reach of our fire . Nonetheless , disappointmentshowed on every face when the order was passed to give over the pursuit and stand off . A murmur of protest , subdued but nevertheless unmistakable , rose from the ship , and I saw men shake their heads in angry disagreement . On the quarterdeckI heard Mr. Porter protest . " We might cut her out from under their noses , sir . " " Too risky , " the captain replied . " We 're not here to lose our ship , Mr. Porter . Fetch her about . " " Aye , aye , sir ! " Porter replied somberly . The great yards swung and the canvas slatted . The helm spun and the ship came about and picked up speed toward the open sea . Behind us the wake creamed , and the gap between us and the vessel we had so lately and so relentlessly pursued opened . In the chains the lead flashed and swung . The leadsman'schant came back upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep eight ! " Then all at once , on a sharp , rising note of alarm : " By the mark seven  --  and a half six a quarter less six ! " Bainbridge 's face went ghastly . He swung about . " Port helm ! " he shouted . " Hard a-port ! " The spokes of the wheel flashed in the sunlight , but it seemed an age before the ship answered . In the meantime she seemed fairly to fly across the water . " A quarter less five ! " I saw men freeze in the rigging . Both Jones and Porterp231leaped for the helm , as if to squeeze an extra inch or so of rudderfrom it . Dead silence fell like a blanket upon the ship , broken only by the hiss of the water overside and the leadsman 's next cry : " By the deep four ! " Only twenty-four feet of water ! Less than half again our normal draft ! From aloft came the sudden shout of the foretop lookout , high pitched with alarm . " Shoals ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came a sickening , grinding crunch from forward , followed by a crashing , tearing , rending sound . The bow reared skyward . The ship lurched to an abrupt stop . Masts and rigging whipped forward , and bowed as if to tear themselves from the decks . I snatched for a hold but went sprawling . Aloft I could see men clutch at the rigging , the spars , the ratlines . One or two , I saw , lost their footing and dangled dangerously high above the deck , safe only by their handhold . Then I found myself tumbling amid the crew of one of the larboardquarter-deck carronades . Someone fell on top of me , and as I struggled to regain my feet I saw that it was Mr. Porter . Even before I could rise I heard him giving orders . " Carpenters ! Lay below and look for damage ! Aloft there ! Back your wind ! Brace those yards around ! Blow her off again ! Lively now ! " I came to my feet with my head ringing and found all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck canted aft and to larboard at an alarming angle . " We 'll never get off ! " I told myself , and all about me I could see the same thought in men 's eyes . As I began to collect my wits I saw that the captain was one of the few on deck who had not been knocked sprawling by the shock . IIe apparently had managed to save himself by catching hold of the mizzen shrouds . Yet , though he had not fallen , it was clear that what had happened was as distressing as an actual blow . His face was deathly , and he stared at Jones and Porter in dazed unbelief , unable to speak . He only blinked when Porter addressed him , and the first lull had to repeat his question before he seemed to hear . " She 's six feet out forward , sir , " Porter reported , " in twelve feet of water . There 's seventeen astern . The carpenters report her making no water in the hold . She 'll float , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lightened forward ? " Bainbridge stared at him a long moment before he seemedto understand . Then with a weary gesture he nodded . " Why , " he cried plaintively , " why always to me ? " He shook his head savagely . " Fetch the guns aft , Mr. Porter , " he commanded . " Cut away the anchors . Start the water in the hold and pump her dry . Let 's see if that does it . " " Aye , aye , sir ! " The desperate agony of the hours that followed can not be described . They were hours of toil for officers and men alike . Yet none complained . Indeed we welcomed violent occupation , for only by keeping our hands and backs busy could we drive from our thoughts the consequences of failure . We had no illusionsas to the mercy of our captors should we not win free . Like the rest , I turned to and pulled and hauled wherever a hand seemed needed . Yet we gained nothing . The anchors were cast loose forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumped dry . All guns were run aft to weight the stern , yet we budged not an inch . As a next resource all but the stern guns were thrown overboard . So was everything else heavy and movable . But not so much as a tremor indicated that she was sliding , even a few inches , toward freedom . Nothing appeared to have the least effect . The tide was falling , and for each inch that we gained by lightening her we lost a corresponding amount in depth overside . As minutes turned into an hour , and as other hours came and passed , faces aboard grew longer and more apprehensive , more urgent , more haggard . A dozen times I found myself pulling at Ben 's elbow . Yet when he looked at me it was without recognition . As if , indeed , he could not see me . I knew his fear . We had reason for fear . The enemy was not idle . He was quick to see our predicament , and he swarmed out to add to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lying astern of us like harpies waiting for the feast . They fired on us from a respectful distance , but their shot fell far short . For a time we were able to hold them off with the stern chasers . But after a little the falling tide caused us to heel over still more sharply , and we were unable to bring our guns to bear . Seeingp233this , a number of other gunboats came out , while those already on station grew bolder and drew closer , choosing to approach upon our lee quarter , where it was obvious that we could but shoot down into the water . On the weather side two or three came within range , but when we tried to depress our guns enough to hit them , we set fire to the side of the ship and only with difficulty , on that sloping deck , managed to put the fire out . Meanwhile the gunboats lay out of harm 's way and continued to pour their fire at us . Fortunately they either shot wild or aimed their fire into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had they chosen to lie closer and rake our decks they might easily have done so with dreadful slaughter . But either they had too much respect for us or they wished to have us alive and whole , for they did not make the attempt . For my part I own the sound of their shot whining through the rigging overhead was enough to send cold prickles chasing down my back , and each time a gun boomed aboard the gunboats , no matter how far away she might be lying , I would involuntarily hunch my shoulders and draw down my head . Toward four o'clock Porter confessed his despair to Captain Bainbridge , his expression bitter . " We 've jettisoned everything movable , sir . Shall we He hesitated . I wondered if he meant to touch off the magazine . But evidently Bainbridge was a better mind reader than I. He nodded . " Cut away the foremast , Mr. Porter , and call all the people aft , " he said . " If that does n't move her -- The carpenters went to work at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while other hands cleared the rigging . It was hard cutting through the seasoned wood  --  nothing like chopping down a green tree . But at length the mast quivered , swayed , and then , slowly at first but with gathering speed , fell , measuring its length across the larboard bulwarks . As it crashed we could make out the way the gunboats that ringed us about inched forward , like a pack of wolves , licking their chops . At a command all hands lay aft , to bring such weight as was possible astern , to lift up her bows and , if luck held , to float her off.  | But luck was against us that day . She did not budge . Captain Bainbridge looked about at the crowded deck . " All right , lads , " he said , " that 's the best we can do . Lay forward now and look to your things . Burn anything you 'd not want to fall into their hands . " He turned to the lieutenant of the Marines . " Mr. Osborne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold them off with muskets ! ' T is all we have now . " The quarter-deck emptied . A chain shot howled through the air overhead . Involuntarily I ducked , and in the same instant I caught the captain 's eye . He smiled faintly and , I thought , encouragingly . His face was white , but he did not flinch . After that I did not duck , although it took an effort . I sneaked a quick glance at Porter . Ile was stiff as a ramrod , waiting . Jones was leaning against the bulwark , examining his fingernails with elaborate unconcern , but even from where I stood I could see that they were black with the day 's labor . He did not seem to notice . Cowdery and Harwood stood beside me ; the former biting his lips , the latter , like myself , frankly apprehensive . Dr. Ridgely stood close behind the captain . He had been sufferingfrom a fever , but now he seemed calm and cool . The captain turned to face us , his officers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be dark . We can bring no guns to bear . I think you all understand what that means . We have two alternatives : surrender , or blow ourselves and our ship into eternity . " He looked about the circle of white , drawn faces , and his own features held the bitterness of failure . No one spoke . A gunboat , bolder than the rest , fired at almostpoint-blank range . I felt , rather than heard , the blam of her guns . New rents appeared in the sails above us . Bainbridge seemed to shake himself . " Very well , gentlemen , " he said , " since you leave it to me to speak . We have three hundred men aboard . Can you or I assumeresponsibility for those lives ? " Porter 's glance swept left and right the faces of us all . No one spoke , but it seemed to me some message passed from each one of us to him . His eyes rested longest upon Jones 's . Then he turned away abruptly and faced the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperceptibly . " Very well , sir I " said Porter formally . A flicker of relief crossed Bainbridge 's drawn features . Porter turned . " Mr. Jones , " he said , " will you " Just a moment , Mr. Porter , " Bainbridge interrupted him . " We must overlook nothing . I lave the carpenters see that she can not be floated , and make sure the pumps are choked . After that have every man collect that which he would take with him . Then " " Aye , aye , sir ! " said Porter . It was quiet in the cockpit , almost too quiet . The deck canted at an uncomfortable angle that made it necessary to pack our sea bags all in a heap in the lower larboard corner . When we tried to walk up the deck to find some particular object that we wished to take with us , we slid back , so that it was necessary to creep on all fours , and even while we packed we felt the ship lurch and settle a little further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harwood , on the other hand , seemed to me more excited , livelier than usual  --  the effect , no doubt , in both cases , of the strain we were under . I wondered if I were similarly affected . Each one of us packed a bag of clothing and a chest of instruments , texts , and such edible delicacies as we could find . " They 'll not let us keep them , " Cowdery said , " but we might as well try ! " " I 'm going to take my money in a belt about my waist , " Harwoodput in . It seemed a good idea . Both Cowdery and I followed suit . We were half packed when a midshipman came with a message from Dr. Ridgely to be sure to take the medicine chest . We were securing this when the ensign came down , and though we could not see it , we could feel the shudder of despair that ran through the ship . Yet when we came on deck the Tripolines had made no move toward us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat to assure them that we had actually surrendered . Only then did they sweep toward us , close enough for us to make out the eager , swarthy faces that lined the rails , topped with twisted rags of turbans and greasy chechias and punctuated at intervalswith gleaming swords and scimitars . From the skylight of the captain 's cabin came the smell of burning papers . Mr. Porter , in full dress , paced the quarter-deck , one eye cocked upon the oncoming flotilla of gunboats , the other turned with occasional restlessness upon the captain 's hatchway . But not a word escaped him , and to all intents and purposes he was ready and capable of assuming full command . Only an instant before the first gunboat hove alongside did Captain Bainbridge appear . When he did Mr. Porter went back to his post by the binnacle , while his eye swept the crowded waist , where the men waited . " Remember , " he said in tones that carried to every corner of the deck . " No resistance ! Your lives depend upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jovial features were set in lines of pain . We knew he blamed himself for our situation , and it would do no good to say that we , at least , held him blameless . He turned to Porter . " Is she scuttled , Mr. Porter ? " " Yes sir , " Porter nodded . " The pumps choked ? " " Yes sir . " " The magazine flooded ? " " Yes sir . Everything is done . " The captain shrugged heavily . " Well , then , " he sighed , " let them come ! " THEY CAME , not more than a minute later , swarming over the side , to larboard first and then upon the weather side , blackeningthe bulwarks like a horde of insects , crawling and brawling among themselves to be first over . I shall not soon forget that sight , for if I had been uneasy as the shot whined overhead , I knew real fear as I saw those snarling , fighting , ragged pirates pour aboard . They were dirty . They were tattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barefooted , and they carried their pistols thrust in the waistbands of their oddly shaped , bag-seated breeches ; their wicked-looking , ugly , heavy-bladed , curved scimitars and yataghans were in their hands , or even clenched between their teeth , as they clambered over the side.  |p237Obviously  these were the weapons with which they meant to deal with us , if dealing were necessary  --  and from their expressionI judged they hoped it would be . Most of them were ferociously mustachioed . All of them were lean , all of them dark  --  of a color difficult to distinguish from dockside dirt . And it was clear that our very helplessness roused them to fanatic fury against us . Their eyes rolled wildly and they bared their teeth and yelled or snarled words in their own peculiar babblingtongue whose meaning was unmistakable . As they spewed over our rail I felt my stomach turn within me , and my knees seemed to go flaccid . On my tongue I tasted the bitter , sour taste of fear . They came aboard first amidships , pouring into the waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the men huddled there and began stripping them of belongings , clothes , even snatching rings from their fingers . Several of them fell to fighting among themselves over some particularly choice bit of loot . On the quarter-deck we were , for a moment at least , somewhatbetter off . One or two ventured a step or two in our direction but , possibly awed by the captain 's black brow and gold braid , stopped and returned to the melee amidships , doubtlessfearing the wrath of their own superiors if the officers were touched before they had had their chance . This breathing spell , however , was short-lived . Still another gunboat came up close under our counter and spewed its plundering horde upon the quarter-deck . I saw Porter and the captain whip out their swords and present them  --  point first  --  at those who would lay hands upon them . I heard Porter 's carrying voice : " Hands off , you dogs ! Where are your officers ? " Then someone seized me by the arms and clutching fingers plucked at the braid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boots . I struggled . It may have been wrong , but I was not ready to have greasy hands laid upon me . Almost before I knew it I was surrounded , borne down beneath the weight of numbers . I smelled the stench of sweaty , unwashed bodies , strong of muttontallow and rancid sheep 's grease . Fists pummeled me . A knife slashed my cheek  --  fortunately no more ! I felt my coat split up the back , my boots slide from my feet . I struck out indiscriminately , this way and that , and felt the rugged satisfaction that comes with crunching bone and smashing flesh beneathmy knuckles . Then all at once there were others amongst us . I saw the scimitars flash , and the group about me faded and fell back . There was a new group here , as fierce as the rest , but better dressed and fighting as if they knew what they were about . Whatever they might be at , we were not objects of their attack . It needed an instant to clear my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these newcomers in among their own people with blades flashing , eyes akindle , shouting , cursing . I saw a Turk slice off another 's head , who was throttling our purser , and the blood spurted from the stump of his neck square into Mr. Spence 's face in a stream that was like the starting of a barrel 's bung . I saw another chop off the hand of a villain that was reaching for our captain 's epaulet , as clean and unconcernedas if lie had been chopping corn ! Closer by , one snatched at me and thrust me behind him , holding me there against the bulwark , while he struck out at his countrymen who surrounded us , driving them back . For a moment I was confused by all of this . But then , as I shook my head and fetched back some of my wits , it came to me that these were , no doubt , the officers of the gunboats who meant to make us prisoners and hold us  --  either to plunder themselves or to carry before their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the instant in which I realized this I glanced about and saw that it was everywhere so . Even in the waist these more disciplined ones were taking charge and driving back the initial wave of murderous looters . Our men down there were scarcely fit for decent exposure . More than half were stripped naked as the day they were born . But they had their lives , and the officers of the gunboats were seeing to it that they were allowed to keep them  --  more were they using their swords in enforcing the command . Some semblance of order was brought to our decks by this means , and after this battle amongst themselves was over , we were ordered over the side into the boats to be taken ashore . The officer who had rescued me , a swart-faced young Levantine barely my own age , turned to me and , taking my arm , pointed with his sharp-curved sword.  | " Go  --  inglesi  --  you go 1 " he said . I pointed to my loblolly boy , in the waist , and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head violently and prodded me toward the side . I reached for my sea bag and medical chest , but he thrust before me and by gestures indicated that I was to take nothing but go at once . I ventured to remonstrate , trying to point out to him that these were only my personal belongings , my clothes and the like , and showing him in pantomime that the tattered shirt and ripped breeches that my struggles had left me were hardly fit for me to wear . Neverthelesshe would not let me have them . Instead he patted my shoulder with much nodding , giving me to understand that they would be brought to me on shore , and then , seizing me by the arm , hurried me to the side and helped me over the rail , pickingmy pocket , as he did so , of what few dollars I had left in it . He did not find the money that I had rolled in a napkin and strapped about my waist , but this was only a matter of luck . Had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have hesitated to chop me in half to get at it . In the boat that lay close overside I found a scene of wild confusion . A number of Turks , in the stern sheets , had stripped Harwood naked as he came from his mother and had discovered his money , over which they were quarreling amongst themselves . The carpenter , Mr. Godby , lay unconscious across a thwart , where the milling crowd surged back and forth across his still form without regard for his unresistant figure . Among others , I saw Ben cowering against the gunwale , seeking to protect himself as best his nearly naked condition would permit . Seeing another boat alongside , filled mainly with our officers , I tried to make my way into it . But almost immediately l found myself surrounded by four or five Turks with drawn swords , who threatened me and made as if to strip me , as they had done the others in my boat . I pretended to submit , and then , as one approached , thrust him violently against the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me by the leg , but I planted my foot in his face and kicked with all my strength , making him reel backward . Then , seeing my chance , I leaped , and landed safe aboard the other boat , where it seemed to me the Turks were somewhat more civil.  | I had not much chance to see who might be my companions in the boat . Mr. Osborne , of the Marines , I noticed , and Mr. Knight , our sailing master , as well as Dr. Cowdery , Mr. Hunt , and three or four of the midshipmen . The rest I had scarcely time to see when I was forced , at sword 's point , to seat myself upon a thwart and take an oar . In this condition we were forced to row toward the town . But when we had got near the landing place we were ordered to cease rowing by signs and gestures , and as the boat lost way two of them came to me and , after dealing me a severe blow on the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and stripped off the remains of my shirt and bore me to the bottom of the boat . I need not say that I struggled with all the force at my command . But they were too many for rnc . I laving stripped me down to the waist and found my improvised money belt , they took that from me and extracted from it the gold I had secreted there as well as my case of surgical knives . They then turned their attention to my pockets , taking all that had been left in them by the Turk who had seen me over the side . My watch , my tinder and snuffbox , the key to my chest , even the ring on my finger that Selina had given me long since and that I valued above anything else that I owned ; and , indeed , I counted myselffortunate that they did not cut off my finger to come at the ring , as I doubt not they would have done had they found it anyway difficult to remove . Having finished with me , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had served all alike , and we stood with only our ragged breeches to our name , were they satisfied . This done , they forced us once again to the oars and made us row in to the stone quay , below the bashaw 's palace . By this time it was quite dark . Yet the quay , as we approachedit , was ablaze with torches , and what we saw awaiting us did little to allay our apprehensions . In the flickering light it looked as though half the city had turned out to usher us on shore ; men , women , and children , some in rags and some in robes ; the women swathed to the eyes in white haiks , the children , often as not , stark naked from their filthy little bellies down . All of them stared at us in silence , with black eyes that glittered ominously . As we climbed up the moss-covered steps of the quay I felt myself jostled by Cowdery and heard his hoarse whisper in my ear.  | " God help us if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , was no part of our captors ' intention . As we came out upon the quay and were mustered there by our guards , an angry howling went up from the crowd , and the foremost among them surged forward . But other guards , posted along the water 's edge , stepped in to meet them with drawn swords , and after a brief tussle the crowd fell back , muttering , growling , shouting what could only be curses at both us and our guards . In the torchlight I could see the wicked blades flicker ; saw one lad who could scarce have been more than eleven split from neck to navel with as little concern as I myself would slit a trout . The act seemed scarcely noticed by the spectators . Indeed , if anything , it seemed to increase their anger toward us . From somewhere in the shadows a stone hurtled to take Mr. Osborne in the cheek and open a gash three inches long . Others followed , and with them a shower of filth and spittle that smeared us from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed into the throng , driving them still farther back upon the quay , while the rest hurried us forward to a gate in the palace wall . Only when we were inside the gate did the shower of missilesand curses die out behind us . There we found ourselves in a sort of formal garden , also lighted by torches , and here we were permitted to wait in such comfort as we might make for ourselves while more boatloads of our companions were fetched in to join us . As we waited I looked at Cowdery , and saw that he had not escaped unscathed . A stone had struck him just beneath the eye , and it was puffed half shut , while the check below it was blue and bruised . His hair and his body was matted with filth , and he looked as if he had not been shaved in a week . Nevertheless he was able to grin at me . " You 're a sight ! " he exclaimed . " I 'll agree with you , " I replied , " if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He held out a piece of a rag to me , evidently clutched from his shirt as they had torn it from his back . " Here , " he said , " wipe the blood from your chin . " For the first time I realized that my own cheek had been cut . I took the rag and mopped at my face . " What d' you suppose they mean to do with us ? " I said.  | " We 're safe for the moment , " he replied . " I doubt they 'd have been so solicitous if they 'd meant to harm us yet . " I had to admit that there was sense in what he said , and my spirits rose somewhat with the thought . After a time another boatload or two of our fellows joined us , and then just as we began to think we might wait there the rest of the night , an officer appeared and held a consultation with our guards . A moment later we were herded together and driven across the garden and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small door , keyhole arched and flanked by marble pillars and a pair of tall black mameluke guards in white chechias and scarlet bournouses and luxurious soft leather boots . At the time I was too miserable to do more than glance at these in passing , but I was later to find them generously sprinkled all about the palace and the palace grounds . I learned then that they formed a special troop  --  and a particularly privileged class  --  whose chief function was to guard the bashaw 's person wherever he went . We were driven along a tiled corridor and up a flight of wide steps , to emerge presently in a vast chamber , some fifty feet long by thirty wide , whose ceiling was elaborately worked in carved plaster arabesques and whose walls and floor were lined with exquisite mosaic tile . Tall , narrow windows overlooked the gardens , each window topped with the traditional horseshoearch of the East . The side of the room opposite the windowscontained a series of doors , similarly arched , which I judged could be thrown open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chamber triple arched doorways , without closing portals , opened , through short passages , into still other chambers as large as that we were in . Above these doorways balconies of brown latticed woodwork thrust into the chamber , and behind this grillwork we could catch occasionalglimpses of movement  --  the white flicker of cloth or a brief glimpse of a curious eye  --  and the rustling and whispering and tittering of women 's tongues . All of this we saw at a glance as we entered . After that glance , however , our eyes were drawn to a cluster of men grouped at the upper end of the room , about a large scarlet cushion , the size of a great round bed , topped with numerous smaller cushions of green and yellow and brown and red . Nop243one occupied this evident seat of honor at the moment , though it was apparent that one of two must occupy the place . These two stood somewhat apart from the rest , and from the deference the others showed them it seemed apparent that they must he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather short and inclined to be softly plump . I would have guessed his age at around thirty-five . His pudgy features were cast in a rich olive tint , and his little eyes were coal black . Just now he was smiling , as if very well pleased and even inclined to look upon us with gracious tolerance . He wore a caftan of white silk , over which was a bournous of light gray wool , trimmed in gold thread . On his head was the inevitable chechia , with its long black tassel , in this case bound round with the long white turban indicating that its wearer was a hadjithatis , he had made the pilgrimage to Mecca . This was Yusuf Karamauli , bashaw , and supreme ruler , of Tripoli . His companion , whom I found later to be Sidi MohammedD'Ghies , Minister of Exterior Relations , was a taller , leaner , older man . His face was hawklike in its expression and gave an extraordinary sense of sharp , speculative intelligence , marred only by an ugly cast in one eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his chin , where it was meticulously parted into two well-tended points . Ills dress was similar to that of the bashaw save in color . His chechia was plain , unadornedwith the turban of a hadji . This man most of us were to come to know better , for it was through him that everything was done . We were kept several minutes under their critical scrutiny , while they discussed us in much the same way that we would discuss cattle that we had just acquired . Both seemed satisfied and more than a little smug over our capture . Presently , when he had apparently had his fill of examining us , the bashaw made a gesture of dismissal , and we were herded down a corridor to another room , not dissimilar , except in size and luxury of appointments , from that we had just left . Here we found Captain Bainbridge and most of the rest of the officers , who lead arrived by a previous boat . Here , also , to our astonishment , was a large table , set in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us with an excellent meal of mutton and fish and fowl , and a sort of farinaceous pudding which we were told was " couscous , " a number of varieties of fruit , including pomegranates and cherries , and some of the most enormous and delicious grapes I have ever tasted . Famished as we were  --  for most of us had not touched food since early morning  --  we washed ourselves clean of the filth that had been flung at us , in basins held for us by the slaves , and then fell upon the meal without question as to such unexpected generosity . Indeed , if anything , we were encouraged by it , as a sign that they meant to deal fairly with us as prisoners of war . Captain Bainbridge , however , evidently did not share our optimism . In fact , at the moment I doubt he thought of anythingsave the loss of his ship , and although he must normally have felt as hungry as any of us , he could do no more than toy with his food . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , herded into the bashaw 's presence , where we found the men also mustered . There the bashaw had us formed into a half circle about him and , with obvious relish , counted us , one by one . This done , he looked upon us with evident satisfaction and spoke a few words to Mohammed D'Ghies in guttural , spitting Arabic , at which D'Ghies laughed heartily and nodded violent agreement . We were thereupon dismissed once more . The officers were again separated from the men , and conducted from his presence , by the Foreign Minister himself . We were led through a labyrinth of passages and antechambersand presently were brought to what appeared to be the main palace gate . Here our guard was doubled , the gates were opened , and we were herded out , to find ourselves in the city itself . It was night , of course , and quite dark , save for the torches carried by our guards , which cast wavering livid shadows against the blank rough walls of the houses on either hand . Here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our march , which was perhaps a mile in distance , I saw not a single window . For the most part the streets were deserted , save where we passed through the market . Here the throngs parted to watch our passage in sullen silence , but , possibly because of the large number of guards that surrounded us , we were offered neither hindrance nor insult . Beyond the market we plunged again into a warren of twisted narrow streets . On either side the walls rose sharply , seeming almost to lean out toward one another overhead , and here and there in places they were joined across the street , so that every now and again we found ourselves walking through a black tunnel . Underfoot the streets were haphazardly cobbled , making rough walking , and several times we came upon tiled fountains set into the walls . Now and again we encountered strings of asses driven by ragged drovers in sack-brown djellabas , whose raucous cries woke echoes in the otherwise silent streets . Once we passed a train of lordly camels plodding on whispering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smell , or combination of smells , however , which stays with me to this day . Everywhere the stench of sewage , from the open gutter , followed us , tinged with the sour-sweet of rotting garbage . Now strong , now faint , this odor was everywhere . But more permeating still , and more insistent , was a dusty , almost earthy smell , which in the long course of time I finally came to recognize as the peculiar smell of Africa . We marched thus for some moments , until we came at last to one of those great nail-studded doors set in the blank wall . Here we were halted while a ponderous key was produced and the door opened . Beyond the door a dark , narrow corridor led to a spacious courtyard , crisscrossed with tiled walks and planted with palms and orange and lemon trees and other sweet-smelling shrubbery . Built about this courtyard , in the form of a hollow square , was the house which we were apparently , at least for the time being , to occupy . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the guards to follow him . Together they entered the house and were gone for some time , leaving the rest of us to wander about the courtyard under the watchful eyes of the guards . I can not speak for the others , but it seemed to me that in that quiet , almost friendly place a sort of peace and sense of reassurance came upon me . Overhead the stars twinkled like flecks of silver in the velvet blanket of the sky , while the white sheen of the moon gleamed on the edges of the palms . In that sheltered place the night wind from off the sea was stilled and the air was mild and balmy . The city of our enemies lay outside the walls that ringed us , and even the guards seemed indifferent ; wearied , perhaps , of brutality . It came over me then that I was very , very tired , and had I been quite sure that this was where we were to remain , I would have stretched upon the tiles and gone to sleep with only what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , and the uncertainty of our position ; the possibility that we would again be moved , and the expectancy of something yet to happen , kept me as well as the rest of our company awake . For myself this did not matter , but I could not but feel sympathy for some of the younger midshipmen . As manly as they endeavored to be , most of them were little more than children  --  the youngest was thirteen  --  and it was clear that the experience had severely shaken them . I spoke of it to Mr. Jones . 1 lc merely snorted . " Stuff I " he growled . " ' Twill make men of ' ern ! " It was half an hour before Captain Bainbridge and the others reappeared at the door . By torchlight , then , Mohammed D'Ghies said a ceremonious farewell , unctuous with salaams , and departed through the black passage to the street . The guards took post at the entrance to the passage , apparently our only avenue of escape , and the captain came down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are fortunate , gentlemen , " he said . " This house was formerly occupied by our American consul . It is to be ours  --  our prison  --  for the time being . ' T is better than I dared hope for , and probably we can stay here as long as we behave in a manner pleasing to the bashaw and his minister , or until they can find some pretext for changing our status . " I think none of us were in any doubt as to his meaning . As officers and prisoners of war we were entitled to certain courtesies . But none of us deluded ourselves with the thought that the rules of civilization would hold for an instant with our captors beyond what was to their immediate advantage . " It wo n't be like home , " Captain Bainbridge continued , " but we 'll have to make the best of it . My greatest regret is that we will not be permitted to share it with the men . " He paused and looked sadly about the ring of sober faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a little defiant . " Can you tell us what 's to become of the men , Captain ? " Jones spoke from the shadow of the palm-lined walk.  |p247The  lines in Bainbridge 's face deepened . He made a gesture almost of impatience . " They 're being confined in the castle . That 's all I know at the moment , " he replied . " Arc they being well treated ? " Jones persisted . The captain shook his great shaggy head . " I do n't know , " he said miserably . " I 'm as anxious to know as yourself , Mr. Jones . I need not add that I have demanded that they be shown every consideration . " There was a brief silence . " Will we be allowed to communicate with our friends , Captain ? " Dr. Ridgely voiced the thought that was in the back of everyone 's mind . Captain Bainbridge shrugged . " I hope so , " he replied . " I hope to find a way . Mr. D'Ghies has agreed to permit the Danish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps he can arrange an exchange of messages for us . He is very highly recommended for his sympathies by Mr. Cathcart , who was our consul here . " He broke off abruptly , as if he had said more than he had meant to say , or as if he were suddenly aware that he had held out to us more hope than he himself held in his heart . He looked about at us blankly from beneath his shaggy brows , his lower lip outthrust slightly , and his lowered , leonine head seemed to sway just the barest perceptible degree from one side to the other . It was easy to sec , then , how close to utter exhaustionhe was . " I suggest , gentlemen , " he sighed wearily at length , " that you get as much rest as possible now . No one knows what tomorrowwill bring . " ON THAT FIRST NIGHT of our captivity we slept upon rush mats and a handful of blankets spread upon the bare tiles ; hard beds indeed ; yet such was our weariness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as welcome as the softest bed . In the morning we were visited by Mr. Nissen , whose house adjoined ours ; a tall , spare , flaxen-haired Dane , with deep blue eyes and the kindliness of a Christ . Officially , he was prepared to act as a go-between for us in the bashaw 's dealings with our own government . Unofficially , he went much further . He arranged that we should have clothing and bedding , much of it from his own house . He saw to it that we were fed and supplied . And he accepted our letters to our friends and families . These notices of our captivity were the first order of the day for most of us . For myself , having no family and few friends , it was finished in a moment . I contented myself with writing a note to Patience , informing her of what had happened and assuring her of our present safety and good health , for I had my doubts that Ben would trouble himself to do so ; doubts , I was to learn later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was followed by one from Mohammed D'Ghies , who came to inform us as to what was expected of us . We might , he told us , have the run of both our own and Mr. Nissen 's houses and their roof terraces , the Dane having alreadybegged the privilege of his for us . We might go as far as the gate and bargain with vendors , but we must not attempt to go beyond . For our part we asked that the clothing and personal belongings , our medicine chests and instruments , that had been stolen from us , be returned , and he promised glibly to exert his best efforts to this end , all the while suavely combinghis little forked beard with his long , talonlike fingers . A request to visit our sick he evaded , promising to take the matter up with the bashaw . At his departure Cowdery and I , after seeing to Dr. Ridgely 's comfort , for the treatment of the previous day had not improved his condition , undertook to explore our new quarters . We found the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished save for beds , and its rooms were spacious and ample to accommodate us all . Most interesting to us was its style , for it abounded in little alcoves and anterooms . Keyhole arches were everywhere , even at the windows . Floors and walls were of tile to the height of a man 's shoulder , and above this walls and ceilings were of fresh white plaster , frequently decorated with intricate arabesques . The best feature , however , was the roof terrace and the observatory on Mr. Nissen 's house . From here we had an excellentview over the city and the sea beyond , of the cupolasp249and minarets of the palace and of the oasis and the sear brown countryside . Far to the eastward , upon the reef , we could make out the wreck of the Philadelphia , lying as we had left her ; a sorry sight , her bows still wrenched high out of the water , her stern deep in the lapping seas , and her flank canted to the empty skies . Her rigging hung in tangled festoons from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of dejection more than matched our own feelings . Yet we could not keep our eyes off her . Even at that distance we could make out the figures of her conquerors swarming upon her decks and scrambling in her rigging . A stream of boats passed between her and the shore , and in the streets below we could see quantities of these robbers running about in our uniform coats and breeches or carrying bits of plunder away upon their backs . It was a sight that could not but impress upon us something of the finality of our plight , and we went below wondering if we would ever see home again . The first two days of our captivity passed uneventfully , but on the third we awoke to find the skies overcast and weather making . Early in the morning our captors took Godby , the carpenter , from amongst us , and later , from the rooftop , we saw boats put out from shore with numbers of our men and make for the wreck . Obviously they meant to try to float her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts , turning every now and again to test the weather . " ' Twill storm by night , " I remember Jones saying . " If it blows hard enough she 'll break up , " M r . Porter replied . The captain himself came up to see what was passing . He looked worried . The storm burst about nightfall , and all through the dark hours we lay and listened to the wind whistling through the shutters of our unglazed windows , to the swish of the rain as it fell in torrents , and to the thunder of the surf on the reefs outside the harbor . When we slept it was with confidence that the Philadelphia could not last . Yet when we rose in the morningthe storm had blown itself out , the sun glinted on the green waters of the harbor and the milky blue of the seas beyond , and the frigate , to our horror and amazement , floated free.  | Late that afternoon Godby came back to us , limping gingerly , his already ragged clothing in tatters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told us . " They wormed the shot from the pumps and forced us to pump her dry . When it came to blow from the north the seas piled up and she floated free ! " " How could they force you ? " the captain burst out angrily . The old man looked at him steadily . " Have ye ever felt the bastinado , Captain ? " Bainbridge did not reply . Godby sat clown suddenly and , painfully and laboriously , pulled off his boots , then lifted his feet for us to see . They were puffed and bruised , black and blue from heel to toe , with great welts alternating with ragged splits , still oozing blood , across them . " ' T is torture , Captain , " the old man quavered with tears in his eyes . " We tried to refuse , but they threw us on our backs and histed our feet an ' laid on with rods . That 's jist one way they had o ' forcin ' us . " The captain ground out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following day several of us were on the roof , watching the progress of the work going forward aboard her through Mr. Nissen 's glass , when Hamet , the dragoman assigned to us , came to us and told us that by order of the bashaw we were no longer to go there . The next day our new masters came and closed up the passage that led aloft . But we had already seen enough . The guns that we had thrown overboard had been raised , as well as the anchors , and it was already all too plain that our labors on board had gone for nothing . Shortly after this event Mohammed D'Ghies sent his secretaryto us with a parole of honor , written in French , which we were all required to sign . But in spite of this we were not allowed to go out upon the streets . Nor were we allowed to visit the men . Indeed our every inquiry in this direction met only with evasion . A little later still the minister himself waited upon us , his immaculate little forked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye staring off into space , and suavely informed us that he had managed to recover eight of our trunks , which we might have for a payment of twelvep251hundred dollars , as a token of friendship to himself ! Needless to say , none of us availed ourselves of this opportunity . I tell of these matters in order to show the childish capriciousnessof our captors . But we were yet to experience the supreme example of this . About a fortnight after our capture several Turks paid a formal call upon the captain and informed him that the bashaw had been told that Captain Rodgers , who commanded the John Adams , had treated the Tripolinc prisoners , taken last summer , very badly , and that they feared we would suffer for it . Captain Bainbridge assured them that he doubted very much any such rumors , saying that that was not our way , and presently , in very friendly fashion , they took their leave . A day or two later , however , Mohammed D'Ghies sent his dragoman to Captain Bainbridge to say that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up those Tripoline prisoners  --  to the number of about eighty  --  we might remain where we were ; but that if he failed to comply we should certainlyfare worse . Despite its seriousness , the threat was ludicrous . The idea of the captain commanding the commodore was as ridiculous as the thought of the minister sending orders to the bashaw . Endeavoring to maintain a sober face , Captain Bainbridge explainedthis to the dragoman , who departed growling that he would carry the message to his master . Nevertheless , about nine that evening , when we were all at table , there was a great commotion at the door , and in marched a Tripoline officer , very fierce , with pistols in his belt and a sword in his hand . The captainrose and demanded to know the meaning of this intrusion . The officer glowered and tapped his pistols . " Tonight nothing , " said he . " Tomorrow the castle ! " When morning came we were formed according to rank and marched to the castle , where we were unceremoniously thrown into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a punishment . Yet it was certainly a greater benefit to us than to our captors . For the first time we saw our shipmates , and at first hand we were permitted to see exactly how they had fared . The dungeon was foul and crowded . Poor Ridgely , more than half sick , we laid in a corner and , arrogating authority to ourselves , commanded him to lie there . Cowdery and Harwood and myself then circulatedamong the men , and what we saw made our blood boil . Striped backs were common . Others had been bastinadoed , and their feet were cracked and swollen . A few had broken toes . There were a number of broken arms and wrists , and several had suffered knife wounds . There was little we could do for them , lacking either medicinesor instruments . When we asked for water from our guards we were laughed at and spat upon . But we tore our shirts and undershirts to shreds and bound up what we could , and spoke of the rest to the captain . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whatever you can , sir , " we replied . " We know your position . But if anyone can demand attention for the men , ' t is you . " He nodded sadly . " You see where we arc , " he replied . We left him then and continued to do what was possible with the means at hand . Now and again we missed a familiar face . " Where 's Brothers , McKee , Johnson , Adams , Rutherford , McLaughlin , Dowerdisher ? " we would ask . The response was surprise in every case . " Why , sick ! " " Did n't you know ? " We had n't known , but we did now . What had been done with our sick was a mystery to us , but we meant to find out , one way or another . If necessary , one of us could feign illness . We were agreed that could be done . It was not necessary . After a day in the dungeon with our men we were , as suddenly as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There we were visited by Mohammed D'Ghies , as unctuous as ever , asking how we did and what might be our wants . Upon being informed of our experience , he expressed great surprise and disclaimed all knowledge of the matter . But we knew he lied . The event infuriated the captain , and he protested strongly to Mr. Nissen , since it was quite evidently futile to protest to D'Ghies , concerning the treatment of the men and our inability to visit our sick . As a result , a day or two later Cowdery and I were permitted to go to them . We found them lodged in a small house without a floor , nearp253the palace . They were without attendants and had had nothing to eat since their removal there but filthy , sour bread . Cowdery and I did what we could , having nothing with which to treat them but our own experience . However , we now had some notion of what was necessary , and with this we returned and reported what we had found . It was too late that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , through 1N/Ir . Nissen , for fresh provisionsto be supplied at our expense . Later we managed to obtain leave to use the loblolly boys as hospital attendants . Hitherto these had been confined with the rest of the crew and employed in the backbreaking labor to which all the men were forced . But from this day two of them were always on duty at sick bay under the eye of a guard , returning on completion of their watch to the common prison . Since this duty freed them from harsher work , and since it enabled them to fare somewhat better than most by reason of sharing the better food now provided for the sick , they were delighted with it and frequently came to blows over whose turn it might be . Proper medicines we could not get at this time , for the bashaw flatly refused to furnish anything . Consul Nissen furnisheda few simple remedies , which was all he could spare , and we were forced , for the time being , to make do with these . However , with the assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the hospital and to make our patients more comfortable ; to see them properly fed and resting upon clean blankets , and since the greater part of their ills consisted in maladies whose principal treatment is rest and bleeding and purging and proper food , they were quick to respond . A day or two after this one of our men , in a fit of despair , attempted to take his own life by cutting his throat . Fortunately he was observed in the act and prevented by the guards , and he was carried to our sick bay and placed in our care . Cowdery managed to check the flow of blood and to sew up the wound , and the frightened guards  --  frightened for they would have been held responsible for the death of a ransomable prisoner  --  were assured that he would recover . A little later I was permitted to call upon a Spanish physician residing in the city for medicines for Dr. Ridgely , whose condition had not improved.  | Whether this was reported in higher circles I do not know , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with my own and Cowdery 's activities at the hospital . It was during the first week in December , after we had been prisoners for something more than a month , that Mohammed D'Ghies called upon us one day and asked , not for Captain Bainbridge , but for Cowdery and myself . Cowdery , at the time , was giving a lecture on simple anatomy , one of those courses which we officers had organized among ourselves to occupy our time , and accordingly it was I who first responded to the summons . As I entered the room D'Ghies greeted me with far more ceremony than I had been accustomed to and asked : " Dr. Cowdery , where is he ? " " He 's occupied at the moment , " I replied . " Ah ! " he nodded , and eyed me gravely . " May I serve you ? " I asked . " The bashaw would see Dr. Cowdery . " " Oh ? " I said , surprised . " And yourself , too , of course , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort had happened before . But before I could comment Cowdery appeared . " Ah , Doctor ! " D'Ghies exclaimed . " If you please , the bashaw would see you and Dr. Tisdall . " Cowdery shot me a quizzical glance , but I could only reply with the most imperceptible shake of the head . He looked back at Mohammed D'Ghies and bowed . " We are yours to command , " he said . The minister led us to the palace , where we passed , by numerous corridors and passageways , past a score of guards , to a chamber overlooking the sea . There we found the bashaw , lying upon an immense divan , surrounded by pillows , and quite evidently not himself . Mohammed D'Ghies greeted him with the utmost ceremony , and both Cowdery and I followed his example . He waved his hand at us feebly and spoke in Arabic to his minister . D'Ghies turned to Cowdery . " His Majesty asks that you examine him , " he said , " and prescribe for his ailment . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple questions , the answers to which only confirmed what seemed already obvious to me , that the bashaw was sufferingp255from nothing more than biliousness resulting from overindulgence . He was a sick man , but not so sick that a purge and a cupping would not cure him . I knew that Cowdery must be as aware of this as I , but I kept my own counsel while he gravely took the swarthy potentate 's pulse , looked at his tongue , and examined his head , neck , and chest . When he had done this he summoned me , with equal gravity , to confer with him . " Obviously , " he said with a long face , " our man is suffering a severe attack of complexus lassibonibus . " " Indubitably , " I agreed . " I would say that bleeding is indicated , followed by a diacydoniumsimple . " I nodded as soberly as I could , for a more harmless remedy had never been proposed . " Yes , " I said , " and I would add a decoction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cowdery nodded sadly . " If only we had them to give ! " " What do you say , sirs ? " D'Ghies asked anxiously . " Is His Majesty 's condition serious ? " Cowdery shook his head . " It is not beyond cure , " he replied . " We see a good deal of this among our men . Unfortunately , we have not the means to treat him or them , since everything has been taken from us . " " I have a chest " the minister began . " No , no ! " Cowdery interrupted him . " I would not stake my reputation on medicines prepared by another . We know the properties of our own . They must be returned to us if we are to accomplish anything here 1 " He turned to me seriously . " Without the Acorus or the Calamus Aromaticus , as I preparedit , we would be lost ! " " Or the Mirabalans , or the Citron and Indian ! " " Aye , or the Emblicks , Belloricks , Polypodium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calaminth , the Bugloss , and the Stoechas ! " From his couch the bashaw spoke wearily , in Arabic , to D'Ghies . The minister began what appeared to be a long ex- planation , but the bashaw gave a weary wave of his hand and closed the conversation with a monosyllable . D'Ghies turned to us . " His Majesty commands that you have whatever you need , " he told us , and added meaningly , " but what you prescribe must be effective . " Cowdery nodded . " You may assure His Majesty , " he said , " that , provided our chests are returned to us , with all our instruments , he may be certain of a cure . " The minister nodded and led us from the room . In an outer chamber he bade us wait . " For what ? " Cowdery demanded . " I will have your chests fetched here . " " Oh no , " said Cowdery . " We must have them fetched to our quarters and left with us , for we have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was on the tip of D'Ghies 's tongue to refuse . Then all at once he grinned knowingly . " Very well , " he said , and sent us with a guard back to our quarters . Half an hour later he himself reappeared followed by three slaves bearing the missing chests . As soon as they were deposited in our rooms we examined them and found them complete . Then , while the minister waited , we prepared a simple purgative and a harmless tonic . ' We were then returned to the palace , but before we were permitted to revisit the bashaw we were taken to a room in which two officers of the palace guard lay squirming upon threadbare pallets . " You see , " said D'Ghies , " they suffer from the same malady that has attacked His Majesty . Treat them exactly as you propose to treat the bashaw , please . " Cowdery looked at me and winked . " I doubt it will help them , " he said . " But at least it will do them no harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work , relieving each of a cupful of blood and administering first the purge and then the tonic . When they did not die under our hands and showed no sign of being about to , Mohammed D'Ghies seemed impressed.  | 57 " Very good ! " he exclaimed . " Now , if you will treat His Majesty --  " This was quickly done to the satisfaction of all , and the bashaw announced himself better already . When we were finishedD'Ghics escorted us to his own apartments . There he turned to us with a hint of embarrassment . " Sirs , " he said , " I hesitate to ask a favor . " I wondered what was coming , but Cowdery was more perceptive . " If we can serve you in any way , Sidi , " he said , " you have only to ask . " " Thank you , Doctor , " D'Ghies muttered , toying with his beard and fixing him with his one good eye . " As you have no doubt observed , I have an eye which is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You would like us to treat it , is that it ? " Mohammed D'Ghies bowed . " That is it , " he replied . " It has been so since I was very young . On some days it is very poor and I can see nothing . It gives me pain . On other days it is not so bad and I can see some things . " " I see , " Cowdery nodded . " I can not promise that we will be able to do much for you , Sidi . Indeed , I doubt if anything we can do will help you . But we can try . That is if you are willing to risk yourself in our hands . " In this way our practice of medicine among our captors began . For Mohammed D'Ghies we were unable to do more than to relieve somewhat the pain he felt . His case was too far advancedand the sight of the eye was as good as gone . Nonetheless , he was grateful for our efforts , as was the bashaw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ii that day we had as much as we could do prescribing for the people of the palace and other officials scattered about the city , whom we were permitted to visit pretty much at will . By way of reward , in addition to the fees we were permitted to charge , we had , once again , our medicine chests and instruments , our medical texts , and even some of our clothing , which was also returned to us . Toward the middle of December we were startled one eveningat sundown by a sudden great blowing of horns on the roof tops , supplemented by the firing of cannon on the forts and a more than ordinary hullabaloo on the part of the muezzinsin the minarets . At first we were apprehensive what all this might mean , fearing some new victory by the Tripolines . But Hamet , who had just finished our daily lesson in Arabic , explained that it only marked the beginning of the month of Ramadan ; in which all Moslems are called upon to fast , and no true follower of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips from sunup until sundown . As may be imagined , this somewhat complicated our task , for the prohibition against food and drink , it appeared , extendedalso to medicines . However , we got around this difficultyby sleeping all day and visiting our patients by night , when whatever we ordered was taken with good grace . Duringthis period Cowdery had the good fortune to cement our relations with the bashaw by curing his child of a particularly virulent bout of the intermittent fever ; while I solidified our relations with the Porte by attending the ambassador from Constantinople . I was returning from one of my visits to this gentleman 's house one evening , when I was called to while passing a coffee stall and requested to enter . Upon responding , I found the Lord High Admiral of Tripoli , no other than our old enemy Peter Lysle , the Scotch runagate , who under the name of Murad Rais had commanded the bashaw 's ships which the Essex had so long since bottled up in Gibraltar . He did not recognize me , nor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invited me to be seated beside him among the cushions and offered me coffee in thimble-sized cups . After some polite conversation , in the course of which he inquiredafter Captain Bainbridge and how we did , he came to the point and stated that he had heard that I had some skill in medicine and surgery . I replied that I did my best in my humble way , whereupon he asked me if I would accept him as a patient . When I told him that I would be glad to do what I could for him , he beamed and pulled up his shirt to show me a great malignant carbuncle upon his belly . He wanted it removed , he told me , not so much because of the pain , which was negligible , but rather because of the effect it had upon his wives , who , he said , could scarcely bear to look upon it withoutshuddering.  |p259I  could not help smiling at the picture , but said that I would have to operate upon it . I thought it could be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was agreeable but even pressed me to perform the surgery on the earliest possible occasion . Accordingly , a day or two later I did so , making a very clean job of it . I will say for him that he scarcely flinched once under the knife , although I was obliged to go quite deep to get at the roots of the growth . Ile made an excellent recovery , and apparently his domestic difficulties were solved , for he was so delighted that he became a fast friend , after his fashion , and had me often to his house for supper , entertaining me lavishly with both food and drink  --  for , although he had turned Turk , his conscience remained elastic in the matter of alcohol . On these occasions he would have in the slave girls from his harem and have them dance for us , all the while urgingme to turn my coat and settle down in Tripoli , where he vowed I could make a fortune as a physician . I confess I was sometimes tempted ! He had a nice taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who looks upon mountains of flesh as an attribute of beauty and stupidity as a female virtue . He even went so far as to offer me my pick  --  barring , of course , his wives , of which he had three . But his price was too high , and I found myself always able , gently but firmly , to refuse . Our cordiality toward one another was in no way affected by my obdurateness , and later , when he called upon me to treat his wives for various ailments of the country , I came to understand his concern over his former difficulties , for if his dancing girls were lovely , these three made them all look like broomstick witches . By the end of Ramadan we had settled down to a routine which was not unbearable . Early in February the bashaw appointedCowdery physician to his family and myself physician to the court . A day or two later he issued an edict permitting the officers to walk out , in groups of six under guard , about the town ; and I flatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due , at least in part , to our good services . Apart from the fact that we remained prisoners , we might have found ourselves reasonably content . A forceful reminder , however , remained of our shame . This was the Philadelphia ,  | which now lay close under the guns of the forts and within sight from our windows . Much had been accomplished upon her . Her foremast had been replaced and her tattered rigging repaired . Her guns had been raised and remounted ; even her anchors had been brought up and bent to new cables . Murad Rais gleefully took pains to inform me that he had been appointed to command her and announced that within the month he expected to put to sea , at the same time playfully jabbing me in the ribs and bidding me mind what liberties I took with his harem in his absence . One afternoon toward mid-February , Cowdery and I were called to treat the bashaw 's eldest daughter , whose husband was Minister of War . Her case was not complicated , and we prescribed for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did so Hamet called our attention to two merchantmen , out beyond the reefs , beating in for the harbor . We looked at them without much interest : a small brig of somehow rather familiar , lines , and a ketch of Mediterranean rig . Indeed , such was our disinterest that we forgot to mention them in the wardroom mess , and in consequence we were as startled as our companions when , some time after we had rolled up in our blankets , we were awakened by a cannon shot from one of the forts below , followed by another and yet another , and then an entire salvo and a sound of screaming and shouting and hubbubfrom the lower town . In a flash we all threw off our blankets and flocked to the windows , pushing and jostling for a view of what was taking place below . At first we could see nothing but the outline of the town lying curved about the bay and silhouetted against a sky dotted with small dark clouds . A curved sickle of a moon hung in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the harbor was black , save for the riding lights of the several vessels moored there below . Suddenly another cannon boomed below us , throwing out a fountain of lurid sparks , followed by several more in ragged unison . The shouting rose to fever pitch , and the crackle of musketry rattled the bars in our windows and streaked the night with blades of fire . Then suddenly a spark of light , intense and white , appeared where the Philadelphialay . In that instant we made out the spars and riggingp261of the ship and the masts and cordage of another vessel lying close aboard . For what seemed a long moment , but which in reality could have been no more than the merest fraction of a second , the light glowed brilliantly below us , and then all at once , with a great wh00000sh , a towering blast of flame roared high in the air from the deck of the frigate , outlining in sharp relief the smallest rope and halliard of her rigging . For an instant we could make out the figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor and all the ring of forts around it lay lighted , brighter than by day against the black curtain of the night . In all that brilliance the flashing of the cannon on the forts , all spitting now with venom , seemed almost anemic . We saw a ketch drawing off from the burning ship , the same ketch that Cowdery and I had seen earlier in the evening . We capered . We thumped one another on the back . We cheered , and our cheers were drowned in the savage roar of the flames as they licked up through the tarred cordage and burst through the open ports of the doomed ship . I found myself at one instant shakinghands with Mr. Porter , embracing Midshipman Rinshaw , and , quite without dignity or regard for rank , dancing a caper with Captain Bainbridge himself , who , for the first time since our capture , seemed happy . " Her guns ! " someone cried from the window . " They 're shotted ! " We rushed for the opening and fought for a view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were exploding , almost point blank , it seemed , into the ketch , struggling in the airless night to draw clear . It seemed a wonder to us that she could continue moving . The toll aboard her must be horrible . Yet she drew off , slowly , almost painfully , under sweeps . Just as slowly , just as painfully , we saw the brig heave into sight . Boats were putting out from shore , boats crammed with musketeers . They crept toward the two ships . Over against the far shore we saw the decks of the gunboats black with men . Through the hysterical , screaming uproar below us we could catch the ominous clank of their capstans as they warped them about , bringing their guns to bear . All about the harbor the guns of the forts were vomiting flame and smoke , and in the center , just below us , great tongues of fire leaped from the frigate and licked at the black belly of a cloud of smoke and showering sparks . It seemed an age as the brig and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawser pass between them , but pass it must have , for presently they were laid out on a line , the brig leading , the ketch following , sweeps churning and the water foaming . Fountains rose as shot fell on either side of them . But by a miracle not a spar fell , not a rope seemed cut . A boat drew near and fell back before a blasting volley from the ketch , and the screaming and the shouting below us seemed to redouble in force . It seemed hours that we watched ; seemed as if our own wills were pulling with our countrymen at those long sweeps that barely made the two ships creep across the glassy black surface of the sea . Then finally we saw the sails shake out and belly and catch the faint breeze that blew from off the shore ; saw them stand away , slowly at first , and then with gathering speed , to disappear in the blackness , beyond the rim of light cast by the burning ship below us . A cannon spoke after them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long pause , a final shot . Below us the screaming died , and silence fell , broken only by the crackle and snarl of the fire on the ship . Sharply , as if to punctuate the event , a last stern chaser aboard the frigate boomed and belched a stream of sparks . We could hear the shot crash heavily amid the masonry of the fort at the point . A moment later her cables parted and she began to drift , toward the shore . Half an hour later her magazines , refilled by her captors , exploded with a smashing concussion that for an instantblasted us from the window . Acrid smoke and livid flame balled upward in a roaring inferno of sparks and debris , mountingwith a tremendous rush . The ship seemed to open and split at every seam , and to stay so for a visible instant . Then , almost wearily , she seemed to collapse inward upon herself , squatteringin the water . Sparks showered down , out of the ball of smoke and flame that hung against the dark velvet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The remnants of the ship , mere burning wreckage now , drifted on toward the shore . An hour or two later she grounded and settled , but all night long the little flames licked across what was left of her ; and as long as a spark remained visible we hung at the windows ,  |p263watching  , cheering , exulting . There was no sleep for any one of us that night . When morning came only a few charred timbers remained . IN THE MORNING it was quickly evident that the Turks were beside themselves with both fear and fury . We officers were placed under a strong guard and were forbidden even to approachthe doors or windows of our quarters . Cowdery and I were forbidden to visit our sick , nor were we permitted to treat any of the people of the palace for several weeks . Our dragoman , Hamet , with whom we had grown friendly , appeared sober and thoughtful , and told us that we might all be moved to the castle . When , at length , Cowdery and I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could not but notice that the town was full of country militia and that , even though several days had passed since the event , the faces of the people were all gloomy and resentful and downcast . We were more than ordinarily snarled at and spat upon that day , and for once I was as well pleased at the presence of our guard , for I would not have cared to venture out alone and unarmed among the people at that time . It was only later that we learned of the brutality with which our men in the castle had been treated . As soon as morning dawned , it was reported , the Turks burst in the doors of their prison and fell among them with clubs and whips until they were exhausted . The men , of course , had been totally unaware of what had happened , having no means to observe the harbor , though they had guessed front the uproar that something much out of the ordinary was taking place . Ben told me , long afterward , that they hoped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roar of which made the walls of the castle shake , that a landing had been effected and that an attempt was being made to rescue them . Throughout the night they had lain half in expectation that the doors would be burst open by a flying squad of Marines , and that they would be armed and permitted to fight their way out . Their disappointment as the night wore on and no such rescue materialized , and their bitterness when morning brought only more brutal treatment than before , may well be imagined . Their lot had been harsh before . It was made well-nigh unbearablenow . As far as we officers were concerned , the Turks showed a curious vacillation . At one moment we would be told that wewould be removed to the castle . In almost the same breath we would be assured that we might remain where we were . We were forbidden to write any letters at all . Then we were accordedthe privilege of writing , subject to the scrutiny of the bashaw or his minister . At length , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle , and there lodged in a dank chamber , much like that in which the men were held . In fact , so close were we to their prison that we could hear them quarreling with their guards at night , when their rations were served ; and in the morning , when they were herded off to labor , or in the evening , when they were fetched back , we could hear them shuffling along the passageway against which our chamber backed . In this prison we remained in close confinement . Indeed , the only concession that was made for almost a month was occasionalpermission to Cowdery or Harwood or myself to visit our sick . In such circumstances it is not surprising that we looked upon our parole as of no force and began to cast about for means of escape . At first this seemed not impossible . The floor of our cell was of earth and lent itself to digging , and accordinglywe had scarcely heard the key turn in the lock upon us before we had chosen a corner and set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin with , using such inadequate tools , and we had to take care that we were not discovered . We worked at night , fetching up the earth and spreading it on the floor and treading it down carefully . By day we piled our beds in that corner , in order , we said , to make more room , and in this way we concealed the entrance  --  a hole about the size of a man 's body around  --  from the eyes of our guards . Later , when we had opportunity to go out to visit our sick , Harwood and Cowdery and I all kept our eyes open for more suitable tools , and in the course of time managed to smuggle in one rusty iron bar , such as is used in prison windows , found in the hospital ,  |p265two  mule shoes , picked up in the street , a camel goad , stolen in the market place , and some odd bits of iron filched casually from here and there . At the same time Mr. Porter managed to persuadeour captors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , in teaching our midshipmen the art of seamanship . These instruments , with a couple of baskets , originally containing fruit , considerably facilitated the work , and by the time we had been three weeks in our new prison we had a tunnel extending down and out some distance in what we hoped was the direction of the shore . This work had been in progress some time when Mr. Jones , picking idly at the wall of our cell with a marlinespike one day , made an important discovery . Like all Turkish buildings of this class , our prison was constructed of large , flat bricks , made of mud , laid flat in a double width and covered by a sort of plaster for smoothness . Mr. Jones discovered that this plaster might easily be chipped away and that underneath it only the flimsiest pretext at mortar held the bricks together . Having made this discovery , it was but the work of a day or two to open a communicating hole with the passage by which our men were herded to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dark enough so the hole was not noticed , while on the inside we were able to disguisethe opening by slipping the bricks back into place and giving the wall an unbroken appearance . Having thus established a channel of communication , it was then necessary to devise the means . Responsibility for this fell to the doctors , and on our next visit to the men we managed to whisper to a few , whom we knew to be trustworthy , the location of the hole . From that point it was a simple matter to exchange written messages . At first it was proposed that they attempt a tunnel from their cell which would join that which we were digging . But this was discarded for several reasons : first , because it was feared that there were some among them who would reveal the plan , in order to gain favor for themselves , and second , because , being under more rigid watch than we were , their work might be much more easily discovered . An alternative plan was that we should dig the tunnel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ready for the final break , and this was the scheme ultimately adopted.  | So fair a beginning deserved a better end . Our first misfortunewas the discovery that the presence of guards posted all along the shore would prevent our opening the tunnel in one direction , while in the other we would have to drive another seventy to eighty feet downward and outward , a distance which would fetch the mouth of the tunnel out under water , where digging was impossible . Consequently the project had to be abandoned , at least for the time being , until we could ascertain whether escape were possible in any other direction . We closed up the hole and filled in the first three or four feet of the tunnel , the better to escape detection , and tramped down the earth above the spot . That evening , in his anxiety to pass on the bad word , Midshipman Henrv , instead of taking the time to pass along a note in writing , endeavored to whisper the news through the opening in the wall to our men as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into our cell and demandedto know who was responsible . Mr. Porter stepped forward and was hustled off to the bashaw , to whom he , characteristically , protested vehemently regarding our treatment . Apparently his unexpected attack confused the bashaw , for he was , within an hour or so , returned to us  --  a thing we had never expected to see  --  not only unpunished , but with the bashaw 's promise of better treatment in the future . Our hole in the wall was stopped up , to be sure , but it was also true that our lot improved considerably for a time . Shortly afterward another attempt to escape was made that was nearly successful . By the same means by which the hole had been opened in the back wall , the captain and Mr. Jones managed to break a passage through one side wall and found their way into the adjoining apartment , which , though locked , was unoccupied . The ceiling in this room had been broken through , leaving a ragged hole , and through this one of our smaller officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was a barred window which overlooked the ramparts of the castle . This seemed to offer enticing possibilities , and a few nights ' work sufficed to loosen the bars sufficiently to remove them , while by day the hole in the wall through which the workers had crept was carefully bricked up to prevent discovery . When all was ready we waited until a small armed sloop entered thep267harbor and moored not far off the point . A plan was then laid to slip out through the window and lower ourselves to the ground on the beach side from one of the cannon embrasures , and from there swim to the vessel , overpower her small crew , and escape . When the night agreed upon arrived , we went , one by one , up through the hole in the adjoining room and lowered ourselves to the ramparts by means of a rope made by tying shirts and trousers together . Thence we crept along in the shadows , until we had reached the point of attack upon the guard . We were just preparing our assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walkway atop the ramparts , and we were obliged to retreat . Luckily we were able to regain the room through which we had escaped without being detected , and , there being no further opportunity that night to put our plan into effect , we replaced the iron grille in the window and returned to our quarters . On the next day we discovered that the sloop had put to sea early the previous evening , so that it was undoubtedly as well for us that the scheme miscarried , else we might all have drowned swimming about in search of her . A few days later the loosened bars in the upper chamber were discovered and recemented , this time beyond all hope of loosening again , and that avenue was closed . Not long afterwardCaptain Bainbridge was removed to private quarters , and I have often wondered if that move had any connection with the loosened bars . If our captors suspected us , that fact was never mentioned in my hearing . Still later a third attempt to escape by tunneling was made , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turks were moving a great forty-two-pounder into a casemateoverhead . The weight of the gun caused the tunnel to collapse , and again we were forced to scuttle for safety . For some curious reason the cause of the cave-in was never discovered by our captors . Nevertheless , we tried no more of that . These adventures carried us through April , and at the outset I was as active as any in them . Toward the end of March , however , the surgeons were called again into service in the palace , and I became too busy to be of much assistance ; the more so since , just as April was beginning , Cowdery fell ill and the entire duty devolved upon me . By the time Cowdery was recovered , I was myself coming down with the bloody flux , and the wicked syroc , the desert wind which blows sultry at this season of the year , was beginning . I found myself strangely apathetic to designs of escape . It was late May before I was again able to bear my share and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blistering sun of the Tripoline summer licked at us with a flaming tongue . The men , forced to labor in its blasting heat , grew leaner , blacker . The officers , cooped , save for an occasional quick march about the city , in the airless , stinking hole of their prison , grew sickly . They escaped the physical brutality of the beatings and the labor , but I believe they carried the marks of their captivity longer than the men , for the poisons bit deeper . Indeed , there were those who carriedthem to their graves , for I think poor Ridgely never recoveredof his illness , and Captain Bainbridge carried deeper scars on his soul than any of the men bore upon their backs . Early in May our squadron appeared off the harbor . The Turks were at first fearful , while we were hopeful , of an attack . But none came , and gradually our captors began to sneer at American impotence and swagger at their own strength . The bashaw even talked of fitting out three frigates with which to blockade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took no action . The bashaw fell ill of an intermittent fever , and Cowdery and myselfwere summoned to his country palace , in a near-by oasis overlooking the sea , to attend him . In July he returned , fully recovered , and Cowdery and I were removed to the palace from the prison and given a private apartment in order to be more readily available to the bashaw and his household . August came in sultry and blazing . I recall that on the secondI dined with Murad Rais for the first time since the destruction of the Philadelphia . He got very drunk and bragged that our carpenters ' crew had been set to build a vessel to replace the frigate , which I knew but did not admit . As usual he tried to persuade me to turn Turk , but this I turned off with a laugh and returned early to my quarters . Early the following afternoon Cowdery and I were suddenlyaroused by a great hue and cry and bustle of excitement ,  |p269a  blowing of horns and shouting of commands , that seemed to burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We stared at one another across our apartment , for it was evident that something out of the ordinary was afoot . At this instant Hamet , who had been assigned to us as our exclusive **44;1374;TOOLONG , burst in excitedly upon us . " Ya sidna , sidna l " he cried breathlessly . " Thy fleet , it conies ! There will be a battle ! " We needed no second prompting , but raced for the terrace , our greater freedom of movement since our removal to the palace including that privilege , doubtless because it was felt that there we could scarcely escape the eye of one guard or another . From that point we would be able to view anything that might take place in the harbor below and on the sea beyond , and on arrival there our first glance showed us that Hamet 's prediction was likely to be quite true . Our squadron was moving in close against the reefs to attack the Tripoline gunboats and galleys in the very shadow of the shore batteries , while they , in turn , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fleet was already moving in to line of battle , just within the shelter of the reefs , where our heavy ships could not approach without running aground or coming under the fire of the forts . Our own ships stood offshore , making a cautious approach before an easterly breeze . The day was fine and hot and bright , and it was warming to the heart to see our squadron , headed by the Constitution , sweep down along the outer reefs , with white sails spread like fleecy clouds against the deep blue of the sea . At a distance each movement seemed so slow and deliberate as to be almost painful , and yet , remembering the way the Philadelphia had scudded before just such a breeze , we were well enough aware of how false was that impression . " Look ! " cried Cowdery . " They 're going out to meet them ! " Several gunboats and row galleys were indeed standing out through the channels through the reefs . " We 'll make mincemeat of them ! " I cried . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoals , " Cowdery replied . " Watch ! They 'll slip back in when the going gets hot . " But a movement in our squadron caught my eye . " What 's Preble doing ? " I cried . " Is he going to run from a miserable handful of gunboats and row galleys ! " The Constitution had come about and was standing back on a long reach toward the open sea , a string of signals fluttering at her halliards . One by one the other vessels also altered course . From the castle roof the movement appeared confused until , all at once , it became apparent that , ship by ship , each must pass within speaking distance of the Constitution . Cowdery chuckled . " The commodore has a trick up his sleeve ! " The trick developed , slowly , beneath our eyes . Our gunboatsand bomb vessels appeared to huddle among the larger ships and for a time disappeared from view . Indeed , the entire squadron seemed to pull together in an aimless mass , and for a time only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lay thus grouped , apparentlyignoring the enemy gunboats and galleys , of which more than a dozen had by now issued through the passes and were outside the reefs . Then with painful deliberation the knot of vessels began , with an almost circular movement , to unravel like a slowly spinning ball . Two bomb ketches stood in toward the batteries on the point , while the gunboats , moving in strings of three , bore down for the passes through the reefs , as if to cut off escape in that direction . Behind them the larger vessels moved in line toward the forts and the enemy craft gathered under their shelter . " Watch now ! " cried Cowdery . But I needed no prompting . It seemed hours while they crept in , moving like puffs of cloud across the water . With equal slowness the Tripoline gunboatsbelow circled and began to draw back toward the harbor entries . It was like watching a game in miniature from where we stood . I did not see the signal when it came , snapping at the frigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun was a great puff of white smoke with a heart of flame that blossomed in the bows of one of the bomb ketches , followedan instant later by a dull boom . The smoke drifted across the vessel , hiding it from view for a moment , all except its tallp271mast and the corner of its white sail . Then a second booming thud caught my ear , and I glanced away to see that the second ketch had also opened fire . Somewhere in the town below us I heard the shells whistle and crash home . Then , in almost the same breath , the batteries all along the shore front spat their answer in a thunderous roaring crash . Beneath our feet the castle rocked and a cloud of mingled smoke and dust arose , casting a gray haze between us and the ships . Through it I saw the Constitution and the Argus open fire ; saw the spiteful flame lick out from their flanks ; saw them reel beneath the recoil and then become shrouded in smoke . Fountains of spray leaped up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw them fire again , and yet again , as they moved majestically along , calmly ignoring the shot that splashed around them . Under my feet I felt the castle tremble and quiver again and again as the batteries belched their salvos . I saw the surface of the harbor plowed suddenly with shot ; saw the shells crash home against the forts ; heard the dull , snarling whine of the shot as it ricocheted from the fortificationsinto the town beyond , and was vaguely conscious of the dull wailing of the terror-stricken townspeople . In that instant it crossed my mind that tomorrow would-be another sorry day for captives . The crash of the guns was by this time so continuous that it was almost impossible to make oneself heard above it , while the drifting smoke made it difficult to follow all that happened off the point . But I became aware suddenly that Cowdery was shaking my arm and pointing . I could see that he was shouting , but only when I put my ear close against his mouth could I hear his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Looking away from the heavier ships , I saw that it was so . The gunboats , ours and theirs , were grouped together , and it was evident that one side or the other had boarded , though at that distance it was impossible to see which . I saw a row galley poke its snout through a bank of drifting smoke ; saw a gunboat close and grapple . Then another drifting wave of smoke hid both vessels from my view . It seemed to me the fight had scarcely begun before Cowdery was tugging at my arm again and bawling in my ear :  | " They 're drawing off ! " It was true . Those Tripolines that could do so had taken shelter behind the reef , while those that remained outside were so battered as to be unmanageable or else they had been boarded and taken . I saw one row galley upon the rocks off the point and several enemy gunboats grounded on the reefs . Three gunboats were being towed off captive , and as they cleared away the Constitution crossed briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle . Below us the rampartsbecame shrouded in smoke , and under our feet the whole structure rocked and trembled . I heard the gunners in the batteryalong the walkway shouting in terror and saw one or two of them scrambling for safety . As the fragments of that salvo whined and whistled about us , it occurred to us that we might do well to follow their example . But that proved to be the last shot of the action . I was not wrong in my thought that the day 's work would mean harsh fare . As at the time of the destruction of the frigate , our men were most brutally set upon and beaten , out of a spirit of pure vengeance , after which they were driven . out in groups , loaded with chains , and forced to labor , some in the town , clearing up the debris resulting from the attack , some upon the fortifications , repairing the defenses . There they were kept , laboring until they dropped from sheer exhaustion , when they were allowed to rest only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-four hours , nor were they protected from the fury of the populace , who were permitted to gather about them and spit upon them and to kick them and throw stones at them . The officers , as usual , were put upon short rations . Their guard was doubled , and they were denied all communication with their friends , even Consul Nissen being barred from visitingthem . Cowdery and myself came off lightest , for by now we were apparently looked upon as indispensable by the bashaw . Nevertheless we were required to keep to the palace . Nor were we permitted to visit either our fellow officers or the men , nor even to attend the sick . As a result we did not know of the inhuman treatment accordedthe men until late the following evening , when Hamet spoke of it in the most casual way as a piece of the news ofp273the town . As soon as he was gone I suggested to Cowdery that we ought to do something . He stared at me . " Do something ? " he said incredulously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ? " I leaped to my feet , nearly upsetting the table . " Aye , " I cried , " but privileged prisoners . We may not be able to demand , but we can bargain . And there 's no one else who can do anything . We must at least try ! " He was obviously reluctant , for fear our brashness might lose us the privileges we had gained . At the same time , however , he dared not refuse to try . With considerable unwillingness he followed me to the quarters of Mohammed D'Ghies . We were received there with unusual coolness . " You wish ? " the minister demanded curtly , without resortingto any of the customary courtesies . I reflected that he had perhaps learned a lesson in directness from the Americans . " To see the bashaw , " I replied equally curtly . Mohammed D'Ghies stared at me coldly . " Why ? " he demanded finally . " The treatment being accorded our men , " I told him . " What about it ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more like a snarl . " Because you wish it ? " " Because the bashaw wishes us to serve him as physicians , " I replied hotly . He glared at me , raking his beard with his long fingers . " Look you , Doctor , " he said at length . " You do not know when you are well off . Do you not realize that you can be driven to your work as the men are driven to theirs ? " I laughed at that . " I never took you for a fool ! " I replied . " You must be aware of the damage that could be done by an unwilling physician . Do you think I do not know as well how to increase illness as cure it ? " " You would not dare ! " he growled . " Would I not ? " I demanded . " Try me and see ! " " You would not care for your punishment . " " Neither would my patient . " " You would be put to death  --  horribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Turk before me ! " I replied . He glowered at me furiously for a long instant . But finally his eye wavered and he looked away . I knew that I had convincedhim . " Moreover , " I said , " the bashaw would have to do withoutour services . " " You will be returned to the prison , " he threatened . I bowed . " I shall myself insist upon it , " I said , " unless this unneces-sarycruelty to the men stops and we are permitted to visit them and the sick . " " I 'll have you flung into solitary confinement ! " I made no reply to that , but simply shrugged to indicate that it made no difference to me . " May I point out "  --  Cowdery spoke for the first time since we had entered the room  --  " that if you drive these men beyond human endurance , you will only deprive yourselves of their services . You ca n't work dead men , you know . " " No ! " I put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mohammed D'Ghies abruptly stopped his angry pacing and whirled about to face us , and I thought I saw in his eyes the realization of the truth of what we said . Nevertheless , he summoned a pair of guards , whom he commanded to carry us off to the castle and lock us up . I think Cowdery would have protested , but I took him firmly by the arm and hustled him before me from the room . After that we marched in silence to our new prison , deep down under the castle , with only a grilled doorway for ventilation and withoutroom to stand upright or even to lie out at full length upon the filthy earthen floor . When the door had slammed behind us and the guards ' lantern gone glimmering off along the black passageway , leavingus in the stinking dark , Cowdery began to grumble . " Now look where you 've got us ! " " Did you expect to get off scot free ? " I demanded with more confidence than I felt . " After all his threats , Mohammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark my words , we 'll be out by morning and called before the bashaw . If I 'm not mistaken , we 'll have our way , too ! "  | 5My companion merely grunted and fell silent , and I was content to do the same . Nevertheless the morning proved that I had gambled upon a sound guess . We were fetched before the bashaw , who was mildly chiding . " Sidi Mohammed tells me that you have been threatening all manner of things , " he said . " Not threatening , Your Majesty , " I replied quickly , for I was not sure what Cowdery might say , " merely pointing out that with our minds so full of anxiety for our countrymen it would be most difficult to keep them upon our work here . As a result we might make mistakes . " He smiled cynically , , and I knew that he understood me perfectly . I think , however , that it was the larger consideration  --  that in overworking the men he was jeopardizing the ransom  --  that decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " We will show our mercy , but only for your sake . The dogs do n't deserve it ! The men will return to their quarters this afternoon . You may visit them . You may go to the hospital when you wish . " I bowed . " Your Majesty is kind , " I lied . I knew that no thought of kindness was in his mind . But it did no harm to flatter him . That evening we visited the men and found them in a miserablestate . I , for one , could not blame them for greeting us almost with resentment , not to mention a hint of derision on the part of the hardier ones . Our lot was so obviously so much better than theirs . We did what we could for them , certifying all we could for sick bay and assuring the rest that , at least , they would have rest and rations as before the attack . One or two taunted us with our fortune . Ray , a marine , evidently a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter ; and Ben , whose feet were in ribbons from the bastinado , seemed to take my ministrations as a personal affront , though I had him transferred to the hospital . Later I availed myself of the opportunity to recommend him to Murad Rais as a man whose skill in shipbuilding was worthy of special consideration . This was the pattern of that entire month and of much of the following . Each succeeding attack  --  and there were several  --  resulted in the same display of brutality and vengeance , the same rebellion on ours . The attack of the ninth followed much the same lines as that of the third , except that , if anything , greater damage was wrought upon the town . In the midst of it a hot shot took effect upon one of our gunboats , passing through her magazine , and we had the sickening experience of seeing her blown , in a tremendous flash of fire and smoke , to bits before our eyes . The attacks of the twenty-fourth and twenty-eighth were night affairs , offering a dazzling display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which passed through the captain 's apartment , nearly burying him in debris and seriously injuring his leg . Indeed , after passing through the one wall , the ball struck the opposite and rebounded , passing so close above the captain as to snatch the blankets from the bed in which he was lying . Midmonth Commodore Preble sent a flag of truce ashore and , I later discovered , offered a ransom of $ 120,000 for us . But this was haughtily refused . Thereafter we were conscious of a gradual tightening of the controls upon us , and we guessed  --  quite rightly , as it proved  --  that the bashaw 's patience was wearing thin . Once Cowdery and I were taken out to identify some bodies which had washed up on shore , between the town and the bashaw 's summer palace . They were undoubtedly those of our countrymen who had lost their lives in the explosion of the gunboat on the ninth , and we begged permission to fetch a squad of men to bury them . This was promised but never carriedout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that direction , we found them scattered all along the shore , their remains much chewed and eaten by the stray dogs that roam the countryside . Once again we begged that they be buried , but were told that it was against Moslem principles to touch dead Christians . Early September brought the fifth and final attack of the summer . As usual , Cowdery and I watched it from the roof of the castle , and were impressed with a greater panic than usual on the part of the defenders . We discovered only later that the batteries were nearly out of powder , and had the attack been renewed another day , I truly believe the forts might have been silenced and a landing effected . As it was , many of the townsfolk fled the city , and most of the tribesmen who had flocked in to offer the bashaw the support of their firelocks  --   |p277for  they owned no modern arms  --  disappeared as hurriedly as they had come . On the following day all the usual instances of cruelty to our people took place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly spat upon them and flung filth and stones at them were now fled . Among those who consideredwithdrawal the better part of valor was the bashaw himself , and we were informed that that evening we were to ride out with him and the rest of his household to his country palace . This forestalled our usual protest over the treatment of our men , and indeed , it was evident that this time such a protest would be useless . We set out from the city sometime after dark and were almost in reach of our objective when we were startled by a sudden blinding flash , which lighted the countryside , and the crash of a tremendous explosion . The ground beneath our horses ' hoofs shuddered , and the darkness which closed in after the thunderclap seemed denser than ever . Our party was at once thrown into a turmoil , and there was a great deal of shouting and argument over the possible cause . Presently we all turned about and rode hell for leather back toward the city . I rode with the hope in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breached and exploded  --  forgetting , for the moment , the shortage of powder  --  and Hamet , sometime later , confided to me that this was the bashaw 's fear as well . But on our arrival we found the city intact and learned that the explosion was that of a fire ship sent in to destroy the shipping in the harbor . But , being prematurelytouched off , it had done little damage . This was the Intrepid , we learned later . A few days after this the squadron withdrew from the coast to winter quarters , and shortly afterward Cowdery and I were again notified of the bodies of several of our countrymen washed up to the east of the town . Called upon to identify them , we saw that three of them had been officers , by the remnants of their dress that still remained , but the bodies themselves were too horribly mangled to be further recognized . Again , and with faint hope , we petitioned the bashaw to permitus to take a detail of men and bury them , and this once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or because he was In an extraordinarily expansive mood , we were permitted to do so . WE NOW ENTERED upon the most difficult period of our captivity , for the bashaw announced to us that he was weary of t dickering and that he intended to treat us henceforth with the greatest severity in order to speed acceptance of his terms . For Cowdery and myself this decree had little meaning , for we were become too valuable to him and had obtained too much confidence to be mistreated . Indeed , there were times when I wondered if we would he included in the ransom , so much did he depend upon us . Consequently we came and went about the town in much the same fashion as before . However , we could not but observe the increased harshness toward the men . All our protests , at this time , were of little avail . The best we could accomplish was the assurance that the men would be worked no longer than from sunup to sundown , and that we would be permitted to visit them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Late in September , on one of my visits to the general prison , I noticed that Ben was missing . I inquired after him , but at first encountered only resentment , as much against myself as against him , I gathered , and surly responses . It was the marine , Ray , who finally told me . " He 's played sawbones and kissed the admiral 's arse . " " Murad Rais ? " I asked , ignoring the uncomplimentary reference to myself . " Do n't mind him , Doc , " put in George Urry , our marine corporal . " He 'd do the same with half a chance . He 's jealous , is all . ' T was yon Scotch runagate , him they call admiral , that took him . He 's to build a new brig for ' em , ' t is said . " As soon as I was back in my own quarters I made discreet inquiries as to Murad 's activities , and a day or two later was rewarded with an invitation to sup with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when I presented myself at his door he greeted me boisterously . " Ye 've been a stranger ! " said he.  | " You 've been a stranger yourself , " I replied . " I 've heard naught from you . " He spread his hands and grinned in jocular apology . " Your countrymen have kept me busy , " he explained , and I laughed because I knew it to be true . " Come in , " said he . " I 've a friend of yours a guest in the house . " I knew the friend of whom he spoke , but I did not reveal to him in what our friendship consisted . Instead I followed him in to the long tiled chamber . As I entered a figure in Turkish dress rose from amid a jumble of cushions and limped to meet me . Although I knew him at once , I had to look twice before I could find a point of semblance to the Ben I had last seen . He was dressed in a bournous of light white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mulberry silk . On his head was a long-tasseled tarboosh , and on his feet the yellow heelless slippers of the country . His beard had been combed and trimmed in the Turkishfashion , but the eyes were the same , mocking , derisive . I felt ragged by comparison . We did not shake hands . " Have you turned " Turk ? " I demanded . He flushed , I thought uncomfortably . Murad laughed . " Gie me time ! " he exclaimed . " ( ale me time ! " He turned away to give orders for the food and the wine , and I seized the opportunity to question Ben . " Are you thinking of it ? " I demanded , though his dress and my own experience with Murad gave me as much answer as I needed . " What 's it to you ? " he replied with a harshness that warned me that questions would only drive him to that end . I shrugged , thinking of Patience . " You 'll be a fool if you do , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it serves a man to turn his coat ? Look at Cowdery ! Look at me ! We 've not turned . We can go back . Then look at Wilson and Heximer and the others who have . What have they gained that you and I have not ? They ca n't go back . They 'll be hanged at the yardarm if they try ! " " Perhaps I do n't want to go back , " he sneered . " ' T is an easy life here , and has its advantages . " " Aye , " I said , " when you 're in favor  --  but when you 're out  --  you know what it can be . Do you think you 'll be better treated if your luck turns again ? " He laughed . " You were always a preacher , Tom ! " he said . Murad Rais returned to us at that moment . " Ye 've been trying to persuade him ' t is a dread thing to turn Turk ? " he asked . " And what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of Scotland and a loving wife of your own ? " I countered . " I ha ' three lovin ' wives , " he replied . " Aye , " I said , " and what about Scotland ? " He did not reply to that , but offered us a drink of stout arrack instead , and I thought it as well not to press the question , considering that I had made my point . The dinner was excellent . Murad 's meals always were . Nor was there any lack of wine to accompany it , but there was an air of restraint . I endeavored to make conversation , asking what manner of ship it was they proposed to build , but neither would give me the satisfaction of an answer . I prodded Murad on the damage done by our attacks , thinking to stir him to argument , but he turned me off with a laugh . After the meal was served there was more arrack and music , the wild squeal of ghaitas and the thump of tambours , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within me . How dangeroussuch a performance was for Ben I well knew , but alwaysand again Patience 's face rose before me , and I sat quiet wondering what I could do about this new development . By degrees our host grew sotted , demanding more and more music and less and less cover for the women , and I , God forgive me , almost forgot that they , too , were captives and forced to this business as our own men had been driven to theirs . If I did not give way and join in the erotic play , it was because of Ben . With him present I could not forget what lay behind us . When Murad rose and staggered away with a voluptuous Spanish wench toward the women 's quarters I leaned toward Ben and nudged him . " Have you written to Pat ? " I asked . He threw me a sharp glance . " Be damned to you , Tisdall ! " he swore . " Must you always be poking your long blue nose in where ' t is not wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again go to Murad Rais 's house , although I was a number of times invited . Since neither he nor anyone in his house had any professional need of me , I preferred to stay away . I took no pleasure in Ben 's company , nor did I mean to pretend that I did . Once , in the palace , I chanced to encounter the admiral , and he chided me on my refusal to dine . " I do n't care for the company you keep , " I told him bluntly . He stared at me in amazement . " Why ? " he demanded . " It 's a long story and I do n't want to tell it , " I said . " But he 's a fine lad , " he protested . " Good company an '  --  an ' inteeligent , full o ' life an ' fun . " " Aye , " I agreed grimly . " I know all about that . " " But ' t was yersel ' bespoke him , " he cried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some skill in shipbuilding , " I said . He glowered at me . " Is't because he 's o ' th ' foremast crew , " he demanded , " an ' ye 're o ' th ' afterguard ? " I shrugged , willing enough to let it go at that . Murad scowled and shook his head . " Na , na , " he growled , " I wouldna had thocht that o ' ye ! " He was not so cordial to me for a long time after . Time , in the meanwhile , did not come to a stand . Early in the autumn it began to become evident that the drought of the preceding summer , combined with our blockade , would resultin a grain famine during the winter . As a result there had been drastic decrees issued by the bashaw , stipulating that no grain should be bought or sold in the open market except to members of his household , and by October all but a favored few were beginning to feel the pinch . The bread which made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's rations had long since been made of sour bean flour , while for meat they had only tough goat or wormy , stringy , half-rotted camel . The townsfolk were little better off , and as their desperation drove them to thievery , so was the harshness of the bashaw 's law exaggerated . In a single day , outside the gates , I saw no fewer than three poor devils have their right hands and left feet brutally chopped off at wrist and ankle and the stumps , plunged in boiling oil , for no worse offense than that they had tried to steal a little food . On many days the number so dealt with was much greater , and when one considers that the common treatment of runaway slaves in this barbarous country is to cut off both feet , the punishment for theft to have a hand or a foot or both chopped off or a red-hot iron laid to the eyes , and the penalty for heretical speech to have the tongue snatched out with a red-hot pincer , the great number of maimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city is not to be wondered at ! By the end of October even those in more exalted positions were beginning to find themselves on short commons , and this was nowhere better borne out than when Murad Rais was abruptly haled before the bashaw for having dared , in defiance of the royal edict , to bid for grain in the open market . I was not present at the quarrel , but it must have been worth witnessing . The admiral , I was told , was more than half drunk , and stoutly , with Scotch stubbornness , maintained his right to buy grain when , where , and for what price he would . This the bashaw as stoutly denied , and he having the upper hand , the outcome was inevitable . My friend found himself unceremoniouslytossed into solitary confinement , where he was kept on a diet of bread and water and such trifles as his acquaintances might smuggle to him , for better than eight weeks . Beyond a sense of sympathy , it seemed to me that this event scarcely concerned me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that I could not possibly imagine . Having the privilege of both the prison and the palace , I found it not too difficult , by means of bribery , to visit him in his cell from time to time , and this I did , taking with me whatever I thought would be welcome . He was always pleased to see me , and the coolness that had grown up between us quite evaporated . On one of these occasions , however , he took opportunity to chide me for my unfriendlinesstoward Ben . " Ah , these accursed Tripoline swine ! " he swore . " Either they fear for their filthy necks or they 're sae jealous as tae gloat ower my misfortunes . Were't not for ye an ' Ben , God alone knows how I 'd manage tae survive this fulthy hole ! " " Ben ? " I asked . " Aye , Ben ! Ye were wrong there , lad ! "  | 83 " Ben ? " I said again , scarcely able to credit my ears . " Have you been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mon ? " he demanded . " Has he no been here nigh eevcry theerd day wi ' this or thot for me ? Has he no stayed in my hoose tae see thot my mimics dinna ploonder me the whiles I 'm here ? Has he no looked after my ain so I 'll be no th ' wurrsc when l cam free ? " I saw no point in adding to his worries . " I did not know that , " I said . Yet when I left him I was troubled vaguely , perhaps because I could not escape the feeling that in some way this might affectPatience . At any rate , I was roused enough to seek Ben out and tax him with it . " What deviltry are you up to now ? " He put on his air of injured innocence . " Deviltry ? What makes you think I 'm up to any deviltry ? Ca n't a man " " Belay that ! I know you ! When you go out of your way . to be thoughtful there 's foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to talk to a shipmate ! " he protested indignantly . " What would you have me do ? Leave the man 's house unguarded ? Where 's the harm if I stay ? I 'm lucky enough to have been overlooked . So long as I do my work at the yard the overseers do n't question mc . I cat and sleep well , and I 'm free to come and go so long as I do n't try to leave the city . Would you have mc be fool enough to go hack ? " " That 's not what I mean , " I said . To myself I had to admit that there was logic in what he said , yet my knowledge of the man told me that there was more to it than this . " What are you talking about , then ? " he demanded . I took a long chance . " You know what I 'm talking about , " I said darkly . " The devil ! " he swore , looking at me sharply . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't , " I said , " but you may be sure lie will . " He laughed . " I 'll deal with him ! Leave that to me ! " " Perhaps , " I said . " But even so , it does n't seem to me right to abuse your host 's hospitality " He broke in upon me angrily  | " Right ! " he exclaimed . " There you go preaching again ! Why , the old devil 's a runagate ! " " That does n't excuse " I began , but he interrupted me again . " What the old cuckold do n't know wo n't hurt him ! Kadijah'snot a wench to lie long alone . Nor is Azizah nor Habibah ! If it were not I , ' t would be Pietro or Mahmud . " I do n't know why I should have been shocked , knowing him , but I was , and my face must have shown it . He broke off abruptly , no doubt realizing how much he had told me . " God damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've no call to curse me , " I replied . " What you do is nothing to me . I 'm only trying to warn you . " " I 'll look out for myself , " he replied . I shrugged and turned away . " It 's your throat , " I said , " not mine . " Murad remained in confinement until past the first of the new year , when we began to hear rumors that the Americans were negotiating with Hamet Karamauli , the present bashaw 's deposed brother , and a number of our ships appeared off the city . Yusuf promptly forgot his grudge and , having need of the admiral 's talents , with characteristic capriciousness , releasedhim as suddenly as he had imprisoned him , returning to him all his old honors and embracing him as if there had never been any disagreement between them . No doubt the restlessnessof the Bedouin tribes of the hinterland , which were beginning to chafe under the costs of the war and the demands made upon them , had something to do with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had . I looked for an explosion when Murad returned to his house , but apparently I belittled Ben 's craftiness . How he managed it I do not know , but it was evident that the admiral remained in ignorance of his horns . Ben continued to live in his house and to eat his food and , for all I know , to sleep with his wives , while the old Scot looked on him with all the favor of an only son . My curiosity got the better of me more than once , and I allowed myself to be persuaded to dine with them , but I never was comfortable . Each time it seemed to me that Ben 's eyes were full of mockery , and that inside he was secretly laughing at me , which , no doubt , he was.  |p285Time  , meanwhile , dragged wearily on . Through private channels we learned that Commodore Samuel Barron had relievedPreble in command of our squadrons and that Preble had gone home . He carried with him the envy and best wishes of every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the coming year , would be able to accomplish what Preble had not namely , our release . One rumor , at least , indicated that our friends were not idle : this was that Hamet Karamauli had been found by the Americans in Egypt and that , together with four thousand men , he had been transported to Sicily with a view to an invasion when the winter was ended . How true this was no one could say , but it was certain that some sort of overtures had been made to Hamet , for it was at this time that Yusuf announced that as our countrymen sought to interfere in the internal management of his realm we were no longer to be regarded as prisoners of war , but rather as members of the rebel party , and that if he were driven to it he would treat us as such . Toward the end of February there was considerable excitement and military preparation in the city . Presently we were told that certain tribes along the Egyptian frontier of the eastern provinces having shown signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppress them . Early in March our squadron reappeared in strength , and there was general fear of an attack . The bashaw raged and swore that if one were made he would put every American in his power to death , be the consequences what they may . A day or two after this the Egyptian expedition marched . As may be imagined , this was a trying time . The men were driven well nigh to the limit of their endurance . The officers , were kept under double guard , their communications with the outside world all but blocked off entirely . Even those of us who by our special skills had obtained a measure of confidence among our captors no longer felt easy , although we were still permitted to come and go about the city with comparative freedom , and Cowdery and myself were still accorded the privilege of going as far as the bashaw 's summer palace for the purpose of attending his family there . Nevertheless , even we were conscious of an atmosphere of tension , lacking the previous spring.  | This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was makingmy way back from the general prison  --  the men having been moved from the castle to an old house on the opposite side of the town , more likely to be struck in the event of an attack . I had passed the former consulate , in which we had first been lodged , and was turnipg up toward the palace , when in the dusk a figure came at me out of a doorway and said , " Hist ! " I recoiled against the opposite wall and turned about to take to my heels , for I was totally unarmed and there had been sinister occurrences in the city of late . But even as I turned the figure spoke again . " Hist ! Tom ! Wait I " I recognized Ben 's voice and turned back , feeling slightly ridiculous . " Oh , it 's you ! " I said . " What the devil d' you mean , jumpingout at me like that ? " " I could n't help it , " he said in a hoarse whisper . " Wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help ? " I cried , amazed that he should have the effrontery . " What 's wrong ? Have your sins come home ? " He clutched at me and held tightly to my bournous , for I had put on the Tripoline garb . My own clothes had long since worn out . " Wait ! " he gasped again . " I know I have n't the right to come to you , but I 've nowhere else to turn . You were right . I own it ! He caught me . I was with Kadijah and I thought him at the shipyard . She had her slippers at the door , ' but he came in anyway ! I think he was suspicious ! I knocked him down and came away ! But he 'll be after me . Please , Tom , you 've got to help me ! " " Why ? " I asked . " I warned you . " " Yes , yes ! " he cried . " But you know what it means ! " " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights , too ! " " Oh , I own it ! I own it ! " he cried . " But we 've been shipmates , Tom ! " " You come to me , " I demanded , " to me , whom you have used as you have ? " ' In Moslem countries when a wife puts her slippers at the door of her room not even her husband may enter until she removes them.  | " Tom I " he exclaimed . " I know I wronged you . But I swear to you , I 've never regretted anything as I 've regretted that ! What I did to you " " ' T is not what you did to me , " I interrupted him harshly . " " Pis what you did to Selina . You killed her ! " " No ! " he cried . " No , I did n't ! " " Yes you did , " I told him . " It was no accident . " " But  --  but " he began . I wrenched myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " All right . I suppose you 're right . I should n't have asked you . But I hoped  --  being on the Essex together and all I had nowhere else to go . " He fell back across the narrow street and leaned for an instant against the wall , then turned slowly away . I had a quick sudden vivid recollection of Patience as she and I had faced one another on that last night in Salem . " Wait ! " I said . " Wait ! " He turned back toward me . " What did you expect of me ? " I demanded . Hope sprang alive in him . " Get me out of the city , " he said eagerly . " If you can let me have some money  --  not much but a little . If you can get me a horse , even an ass  --  at least I 'll be free . I 'll go east and join Hamet Karamauli . " " Hamet ? " I said . " But he 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he cried . " What do you think the bashaw is sending an expedition eastward for ? I lamet has raised an army in Egypt . That 's why ! " " No ! " I exclaimed , for I had heard nothing like this before . " You know why the expedition was sent . " " Aye , " he cried , " I know why they said it was sent . But this I have from Murad himself , who surely must know . GeneralEaton has landed at Alexandria with a force of marines and joined Hamet . They 're marching on l ) crnc now ! " It could be true . I thought of the evasions and tensions of the past two months . It probably was true . But what of that ? I felt confused . I thought of Selina , and of Patience . I had vengeance within my grasp , but could I carry it out ? If I denied him now , would not his blood be on my head ? Would I not place myself in the position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might one day claim Patience for my own ? If I did so , could I honorably ask Patienceto My own heart told me that I could not . " Wait ! " I said again . He had not moved . How could I help him ? I had money . I had not treated any but the bashaw without fee . I might even pass him out through the gates . After that , what ? He would be on his own . It was a long journey to Libya and the Egyptian frontier . There were tribes living between , Bedouins , whom even the bashaw feared . It was possible , it was even probable , that he would not win through . Yet would I not have ( lone my part ? Could I not then go to Patience with a clear conscience ? I thought then that I could . But what to do first ? Where could I hide him until I could make the necessary arrangements to smuggle him from the city ? To the palace ? Obviously not ! He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . To the prison ? To the hospital ? They would be the first places he would look . " I ca n't take you to my quarters , " I said . " Your quarters ? " he asked , surprised . " You 'll have to hide somewhere until I can get things to-gether . " " You 'll help me , then ? " he cried . " You 'll do it ? Ah , God love you , Tom ! I knew I could count on you ! " " ' T is not for any regard I have for you , " I said curtly . He was discreet enough to make no reply to that . " I 've got to think where to hide you first , " I went on . " Whatabout the shipyard ? " " He 'll look there , " he replied . " Probably , " I agreed . I thought desperately , and suddenly remembered a small coffeehouse in the bazaar , kept by a runagate Irishman whom I had cured once of a pox . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friend . I often went there when I wished a few moments ' quiet alone . " I have it , " I said . " Come along ! " He followed me , and I led the way by a roundabout , darkenedroute to the place I had chosen . It was a small open shop , where the customers squatted upon cushions and sipped at their Yp289tiny cups , but I felt certain that behind its one small room there were other accommodations . Fortunately the place was empty , as I was sure it would he at that hour . I took Ben in and made him sit with his hack to the street and , after ordering coffee , beckoned the proprietor to come and sit with us . In a low voice I explained some of the circumstances to him : that my comrade was a fugitive and that I meant to help him escape ; that I needed some place to hide him momentarily and that it was unlikely that any search for him would extend this far , it being a private matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wink , so that he might understand the nature of the offense . He took me , though he was for a moment doubtful . But presently he fell in with the idea , having long entertained the hope of escape himself , and finally he agreed to hide Ben in the single room behind his shop , on condition that it would not be for more than a day or two . At the palace , in our own apartments , I ate a silent meal with Cowdery , who was moody over a fancied slight which the bey  --  the eldest son of the bashaw  --  had put upon him , turningover and over in my mind the possibilities of Ben 's escape . It came to me , as I ate , that it was possible that Ben might win through to safety . It was possible that he might wander for years in the deserts , to turn up later when I had claimed Patience for my own , and upset all that we might by then have built . Such cases were not unheard of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given up for dead , to haunt or delight those he had left behind . I f he did not , how could I ever be sure that he would not ? My thoughts turned again to Patience and our last parting , and I knew that I could not , in conscience , ask her to love me and be mine unless I knew for a certainty that Ben were dead . Neither could I have a hand in his death . In those circumstances it seemed to me that only one course was possible . Where he went there must I also go ! Cowdery finished his meal and went out to play chess with the Minister of Exterior Relations , a pastime I knew he did not relishbut followed to ingratiate himself . For my part I went to my room and counted my money , while Hamet cleared away the remains of our evening meal . While I had not stinted myself in my living , neither had I belittled my services to the members of the bashaw 's court . I had demanded fees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as a consequence I was not short of money . My own experience told me that in this land of the extended palm I could buy a dozen average men for as much as I held in my hands . So I began to wonder if Hamet , our dragoman , might not be amenable to the persuasion of gold . A little judicious inquiry , I thought , would not be out of order . I put away my money and went out to talk to him , offering as a pretext that I wished to practice my Arabic , in which he had been tutoring us since our arrival . " How long hast thou served the bashaw , Hamet ? " I asked , using the familiar pronoun as is done in that tongue . " Three  --  four years , " he replied . " Before that I worked two years for the Amrikani Consul Cascar ( Cathcart ) , and before that six years for the Inglesi Mokdono ( MacDon-ough ) . " " Thou wert young , then , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " It was Sidi Mokdono who found me in the market place and bought me from the Bedaween . " " Eh ? " I said , at once interested . " Thou art not of Tripoli , then ? " He shook his head . " I am of Beni Isguen , in the country of the Mzab , southwardof the Bled es Chebka . " " Where is that ? " I asked . He waved a hand vaguely across the city . " To the west , below the mountains , at the edge of the desert . A month 's journey by camel if one does not fall in with rob-bers . " " Eh , that is a long way , " I nodded . " But not as long as to America . How came ye here ? " " The Beni Mzab are traders , " he said . " I came in a caravan with my father , from Ghardaia , for Horns , where we planned to take ship and continue the pilgrimage to Mecca . But near Jefren we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and carried me slave to Tripoli . " I was not surprised , for I knew the tribes of the back country to be lawless.  | " And will ye spend all thy days in Tripoli ? " " What would ye ? " he shrugged . " One day , perhaps , if I find the means , I will continue to Mecca . There is naught to hold me here . Nor have I anything to return to in the Mzab . " " If thou hadst money , " I said , " thou mightest complete thy pilgrimage and then return to the Mzab . Thou wouldst be a personage . " He looked at me sharply . " Why do ye say that ? " " How much would it take , Hamet ? " I countered . " Two hundred sequins in gold ? " That was the equivalent of about one hundred dollars of our money , yet I knew it to be a vast sum here . Hamet put down the cloth with which he was polishing our couscous bowl and eyed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would ye accept it if I did ? " I said . He hesitated . " Suppose , " I suggested , " it were not two hundred but four hundred sequins ? " His black eyes gleamed , then suddenly turned wary once again . He shrugged and picked up the cloth . " Why make such talk ? " he asked carelessly . " Such things do not happen . Ye make sport of me ! " " I do not make sport of thee , Hamet , " I retorted . " Thy story interests me . " He gave me a sidelong glance and continued polishing , waiting . " If I were to give thee such a sum , " I said , " would ye leave Tripoli ? " " Yes , " he said shortly . " Very well , " I replied , " I will give it to thee . " He dropped both cloth and bowl and turned to me . " Ya , Sidi Doctor ! " he cried . " Dost mean this ? " " Ssssh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cried aloud from the roof tops . I will give it to thee " A look of unbelievable joy overspread his face. "  --  but on two conditions only , " I concluded . His expression of happiness was abruptly wiped away and as suddenly replaced by a scowl of suspicion.  | " Ah ! " he growled . " The gift camel is usually lame ! " " There is nothing without its price , " I retorted . He nodded gravely . " That is true , " he said at length . " What is it ye wish ? " " First , " I said , " that ye start as soon as may be , and second , that I and one other go with thee . " He looked at me in astonishment . " Thou ! " he exclaimed . " But ye do well here ! " " I would return to my own people , " I replied . " Ye will be ransomed , " he said . " I have been here a year and a half , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that as I once was . " He stared at me for a long time , no doubt turning over in his mind my sincerity , weighing the risk . " It will be difficult . " " Leaving the city will be the most difficult , " I said . " I think it can he managed . " " It will be dangerous . " " That is why I need thy help , " I replied . " We will be many days on the road , and we are strangers . " He nodded . " I see , " he said , and fell into thought while I sat with my stomach tied in a tight knot , for I had risked everything . Presentlyhe looked up . " And this other ? " he asked . " A friend , " I told him . " One of the other Amrikani . " " Not Sidi Cowdery ? " " No , " I said . He half smiled . " That is good . What do ye propose ? " I knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will give thee fifty sequins in gold now , " I said . " Once free of the city and safely on the road , I will pay thee fifty more . When we reach Egypt , or any other place where we are able to rejoin our people , I will pay thee the balance  --  three hundred sequins ! In fact , " I added , " if ye will place me on board an American man-of-war , I will give thee five hundred sequins ! " His eyes gleamed briefly , but he did not answer at once . Insteadhe sat cross-legged in silence , evidently considering my proposal from every side , while I , literally , held my breath . Ifp293he were loyal to the bashaw he might denounce me and end the matter , though this I thought hardly likely , for it could only resultin my imprisonment and would offer no gain for him . I was well enough acquainted with the Moslem character to know that in matters of money our notions of honesty did not meet . It was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then turn about and sell his information for a reward to our enemies . I had one horrible instant of doubt , and then he glanced up , smiling , and held out his hand . " I am thy man , " he said . I was conscious of a wave of relief . Had he contemplated treachery , I felt , he would have bargained for a greater advance in order to have from me as much as possible before going to the bashaw or Mohammed D'Ghies . His willingness to accept my offer at its face value I considered an earnest of his good faith , and I gave him my hand upon it . I took him into my confidence then , outlining the situation to him as it stood , though without going into the basis of Murad 's quarrel with Ben , letting it stand simply that he was in hiding and that we had agreed together upon escape . Hamet nodded understanding . " First , " he said , " we must pass the gates . " I knew what he meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to come and go between the city and the summer palace , this was allowed only when we were armed with proper passes and accompanied by guards . True , of late such guard had consisted of Hamet and a single mameluke , but even that one had been assigned to us upon applicationat the mameluke 's barrack , where we also received our mounts , and passage beyond the walls without him was impossible . By custom the city gates were closed at sundown and reopened only at sunrise , and between those hours it was difficult even for the bashaw himself to pass in or out . Our passes were never written to include this privilege . If we were benighted at the summer palace we must wait there until morning before we could return to the city . And only the most urgentnecessity would permit us to pass out at night . By day there was a constant stream of traffic : farmers and inhabitants of the surrounding countryside passing to and from the market ,  | traders with caravans from or for the hinterland , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These people were seldom questioned or examined . Yet it would be impossible for one of our people , without either a permit or an excellent disguise , to slip through . " He might pass over the walls , " I suggested . Hamet shook his head . " They are well guarded , and will be even better watched when he is missed . " " Thou couldst take him through , " I said , " as a drover of asses . " " They will be on the watch for him , " he objected , " and if he has not had practice in pretending , the best of disguises might not serve him . Has he experience with animals ? Does he know the cries of a drover ? " I had to admit that it was unlikely . He smiled . " Then , " he said , " it is best to be bold . " " Thou bast something in mind ? " I asked . He nodded . " Suppose thy friend were the mameluke ? " he demanded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to me . " I suppose he might pass for one , with his beard trimmed and his face blacked , and if he were not questioned . " " Has the guard ever yet been questioned ? " he asked . I thought . It was true . It was invariably Hamet who presentedour passes and answered questions . " But the uniform , " I said , " and the guard assigned ? " " I have a plan , " he grinned . " Hark ye 1 " For an hour we talked , and when we were finished our scheme was laid . I paid him the money I had promised and an additional sum besides , for bribes and to make certain purchasesto provide for our journey . Later I went out to the coffeeshop where I had hidden Ben . There we were joined presently by Hamet . After a cup or two , to the relief of our host , we left and went to the home of a friend of Hamet 's who kept a tea stall near the Babelpasha , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . After receiving assurance that Ben would be safe hidden there , I returned to my quarters in the palace . I had not been half an hour there before Murad called upon me in a state of fury.  | " Where is he ? " he demanded . " The dog ! The ungrateful spawn of hell ! " I did not pretend I did not know of whom he spoke . " So the devil has come home to roost ? " I laughed . " D'ye mock at me , ye yankee dog ? " lie bawled . " Mock at you ? " I demanded . " Did I not try to warn you ? " He stared at me . " You seem to know a great deal ! " " Eh ! " I exclaimed . " You came here , did n't you ? " " Aye I " he cried . " I came here because I know --  " Because you know what ? " I demanded . Because you knew that I knew Ben ! But I warned you . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no more ? Did you not tell me that I misjudged him ? Now you come crying to me that the dog ' is an ungrateful spawn of hell . ' D' you think I can not guess whom you mean ? I have had my own experience of him ! " He stared , half trying to fathom what I knew . " I do n't know what he has done to you , " I said , striking while I had the advantage , " but I know the man , and I can add two and two ! What has happened ? " " Happened ? " he cried , wilting all at once . " Lad , ye were right ! " And he went on to tell me all that Ben had already told me , and a little more . I was half tempted to go back on my promise to Ben , remembering my own case . But then , thinking sharply of Patience , I caught myself . " Has he been to ye ? " he demanded abruptly . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He nodded . " He has no better opinion o ' yersel ' , " he grumbled . " Have you looked at the yard for him ? " I asked . " At the yard , at the preeson ! " he exclaimed . " Everywhere ! He 's hid i ' th ' town somewhere , I 'll warrant . " " Unless he 's tried to swim out to the squadron . " He stared at me incredulously . " D'ye think he 'd risk it ? " " He 's a fine swimmer . " " He 'd never make it ! " I shook my head.  | " Never in this world , " I agreed , " but I 'll stake my life ' t is what he 's tried ! " He looked sober . " I 'll nae believe it ! " he exclaimed . " Th ' fool ! I 'll nae believe it ! " He went away at length , not at all convinced that Ben was not hiding somewhere in the town , but apparently satisfied as to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waiting which was harder to support than all the months of captivity that had gone before . Ben fretted and fumed . He was for making a dash for it at once , and devil take the consequences . I must admit that I was not much behind him in impatience . But I lamet maintained a firm hand and a steady head , stoutly asserting that unless the ordering of our escape were left to him he would have none of it . Such a journey , he pointed out , could not be lightly undertaken . We would need supplies of food and drink , and beasts to carry them . We would need disguises , for once in the country , we must make ourselves as inconspicuous as possible . And , having done all this , we must lay a plan of action , so carefully considered and so familiar to each one of us that we might be prepared for any slip in its execution . Moreover , he pointed out , at the moment the town was in a state of excitement over Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doubled . Searching parties continued to scour the streets  --  althoughby the end of the third day it was pretty well accepted that he had attempted to swim off to the squadron . All passers by the gates were carefully examined , and even Cowdery and myself were more carefully watched . Until this vigilance was somewhat relaxed there could be no hope of escape , and we had no choice but to wait . In the meantime Hamet prepared for the journey . Since it was impossible to obtain provisions in the city , he made several excursions to near-by hamlets where , a little here and a little there , he gradually secured what we would need and brought them together at the house of a friend in Ain Zara , a little distancesouth of the great oasis which surrounds the city . At the same time he secured disguises and instructed us in the roles we were to play , for he had decided that once clear of the city , we should pass as Moors , of Morocco ; myself to be a learnedp297tabib , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hamet , and Ben , my runagate slave . This would accountboth for my accent and for Ben 's almost total lack of Arabic , while at the same time my skill as a physician might be used to our advantage to pacify such as might be suspicious of us . For this purpose , however , he was careful to instruct me to take only the simplest of instruments and remedies : a cup , three or four lancets and a scalpel or two , and anything that might serve as a burning iron , a pot or two of healing ointment , and a handful of simple herbs or drugs , he said , would he sufficient , for if I appeared too elaborately equipped , such was the primitivestate of medicine in that country , it might excite suspicion ! In this way we sweated and fretted away nearly a fortnight until , one morning , Hamet quietly let me know that everything was ready and that I might now set about my part , which involvedour actual departure from the town . My plan for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bey , and his family were that month at the summer palace . Before his departure I had had occasion to treat the bey for a mild indisposition of the kidneys ; as a result nothing had been simpler than to hint a time or two , during our wait , that it might be well to examine him and inquire as to his progress . Since I had thus quietly indicated my intent , it came as no surprise to Mohammed D'Ghies when I applied to him for permission to ride out that afternoon to see the bey . Without other comment than a jest at continuing business with pleasure , he sat down and wrote out the necessary permit which would pass me and my dragoman and a guard through the gates , and at the same time prepared an order to the captain at the marmeluke barracks to provide me with a guard and the necessary mounts . Now came the most trying time of all , for we had decided that it was best to pass the gates as late as possible in the day in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might start . In view of the ride ahead of us , it would have been sensible to have slept at least a part of the day , but , though I tried , I soon found this to be out of the question . I started up at each sound , fearful lest , by some mischance , our scheme had been discovered , while at midday , when our dinner was served , I ate so little that Cowdery remarked upon it . " What 's the matter with you ? " he asked  | " I 'm not hungry , " I said , trying to appear offhand . He eyed me seriously . " If you 're coming down with anything , " he said , " you 'd betterlet me see the bey in your place . " " There 's nothing the matter with me , " I growled , for I had said nothing to him of our plans . " I 'm liverish , that 's all . The ride and a physic will do me good . " " As you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at snail 's pace , but I have observedof time that it never quite stands wholly still . A little past midafternoon Hamet looked in . " Are you ready , ya sidi ? " he asked inc . I nodded and rose , gathering up my equipment . Cowdery glanced up from the book he was reading . " You 're off ? " he asked . " We 're away , " I replied , trying to appear casual . " My respects to the bey , " he remarked . " Will you be back tomorrow ? " " Unless I can find some excuse to stay longer ! " He grinned and winked . " Well , do n't hurry on my account , " he said dryly . As we went out I heard Hamet 's chuckle of approval . At the mameluke barracks we were given mounts and assignedour guard , a stout , pleasant-natured black , who had accompanied me on previous occasions . A moment later we were riding slowly toward the Babelpasha . It was now my turn to show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my place at the head of our little procession and sat my horse listlessly , allowing him to amble along dispiritedly and from time to time passing my hand across my face and drooping as if ill . Twice I took the wrong turning and had to be reminded of our direction . Hamet pretended to eye me with concern . All of this was not lost upon our guard , and presently he began to look serious , as if he were aware that all was not well with me , and to question Hamet . The latter called ahead to me to know if I were all right . At that I reined in . " I am a bit faint , " I said . " Perhaps it would be well to rest before we set out . " Hamet glanced at the sun , as if calculating the time we might spend , then spoke to the guard.  | " The doctor is unwell , " he said . " He would like to take some refreshment before starting his journey . " The mameluke looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put in . " I can add to it a powder which will revive me . Perhaps thou wouldst join us ? " " I have a friend who keeps a teashop not far from here , " Hamet suggested . The guard shrugged . " Ai , well ! " he sighed . " Where is the harm ? I would feel better for a glass myself . " Hamet led the way to the place where we had Ben hidden , I all the way maintaining my play-acting . There we dismounted and entered , and our host fetched cushions for us to sit upon , a brazier and a small brass kettle , tea , mint , and a loaf of sugar . Hamet brewed the drink , mixing the mint and the tea together , adding two lumps of sugar the size of my fist , and pouring hot water over the whole and fetching it to a boil . The pitcher of hot water he passed to me to put down , while he stirred the brew , and I , with seeming indifference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and the guard . When the tea was ready Hamet served it out in small glasses , whereupon I picked up my pouch and rummaged in it for a small paper containing a few grains of belladonna , previously prepared . This I mixed carefully with my tea , the while Hamnet and the guard sat politely watching . But when I turned to put my pouch upon the floor beside me , as if by accident I tipped over the pitcher of water in the direction of the guard . Hamet leaped and caught at the pitcher . The guard scrambledaside , snatching his bournous out of the way . Hamet bellowed for our host to fetch a swab , while I moved out of my seat and over into Hamet 's with the dignity befitting my position , at the same time picking up Hamet 's glass and holding it , as if it were my own , waiting for them to resume their places . When the flurry of excitement had died down Hamet took the place lately vacated by the guard , leaving the mameluke that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his seat he glanced at the glass in front of him . " I exchanged glasses , " I said , " when I moved . That is the one that was here . " I indicated the empty space before me . He nodded , and I felt the trick had worked . Though he had not seen me move it , he was aware that his attention had been distracted , and he was willing to accept my assurance that the exchange had been made . Nevertheless , I did not breathe easily until , with much polite smacking of his lips to show his appreciation , he had drained his glass . Thereafter I refilled the glasses around and engaged him in conversation . Within a matter of minutes I saw that the drug was beginning to take effect , and within a quarter of an hour more he was gibbering and shaking and making desperate efforts to remain awake , evidently aware that something was amiss , yet not having the power to call out for help . This was the point , I felt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shop was open to the street , and a chance passer-by might easily observe that something was wrong within . Accordingly , I now signaled to Hamet , and while our host kept watch at the entrance we raised the unfortunate man between us and carried him off into the room at the back where we found Ben awaiting us in a frenzy of impatience , his hands and feet already blacked and his beard trimmed in preparation for the role he was to assume . Our mameluke was by now totally unconscious , and I began to have some qualms lest I might have given him an overdose . But there was no time to consider that now . Without further delay we stripped him of his uniform and helped Ben into it . " Could n't you have picked a guard more my size ? " he complained . " ' T is miles too big ! " " Nonsense ! " I growled . " ' T is not so bad a fit but the bournous will cover it . Be thankful that it 's rather too large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teashop I gave the owner a gold piece and would have stopped to give directions for reviving our victim . But this Hamet would not allow . " Come , sidi ! " he cried . " The gates will be closed ! " They were , indeed , already unhooked and ajar when we came up at a smart hand trot . As we had previously arranged , Ben did not pause as we came to them , but continued on through , reining up a dozen yards beyond to wait for us , while Hamet and I stopped to present our pass . As we had expected , in Ben 's case , the bournous and chechia of the mameluke were sufficient . But the officer in charge tookp301our pass and read it carefully , giving us a searching look before handing it back . Then , with a careless glance toward Ben , he waved us on , and we rode off at an ambling walk . WE RODE for an hour or more until we were come , by my reckoning , about a quarter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were overtaken by the swift African dusk , we left the main highway abruptly , striking off along a winding , hard-beaten little footpath . This we followed for a mile or more and then turned off again , along an even more obscure trail that slithered through the thick undergrowth beneath the towering palms of the oasis and came , after another hour or so of silent riding , into a little clearing , at one side of which stood one of those little domed , whitewashed tombs , or marabewts , with which this countryside is dotted . It was full night by now , but there was a lopsided moon , and in its light the white tomb stood out ghostly sharp in the shadows , while its single arched doorway gaped in its front like the eaten-away hole in a leper 's face . All around us we could hear the chirp and chatter of nocturnal life , while overhead the fronds of the palms caught the silver sheen of the moonlight and stirred and clattered gently , whispering in the hot wind that blew from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . Ben and I followed suit . Without a word Hamct handed me the reins of his mount and disappeared inside the tomb . An instant later he reappeared carrying a bulky bundle . " Here ye become Moors , " he grinned . " " These arc the clothes I have procured for ye . " Piece by piece he held them up , naming each and explaining its use and mode of wear : the serwal , or baggy pantaloons , full in the seat but tapering about the calves ; the tshamir , a brief shirt , shaped like a sack , with holes for the head and arms , and worn as an undershirt ; the gandoura , a longer shirt , reaching slightly below the knees , embroidered , and shaped to fit at the neck and shoulders and having short sleeves ; the caftan , or outer shirt , which is colored and the same as that in use in Tripoli ; the hzam , a wide , brightly decorated girdle ; and the whole topped by a short-sleeved , hooded , sacklike garment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bournous , or outer cloak , worn by the Tripolines . For headgear we were introduced to the fez , a somewhat higher , more conical form of the Tripoline chechia ; while for footgear Hamet had providedsoft leather stocking boots called t'mag , over which were worn the yellow slippers common in Tripoli . Having gone over these costumes piece by piece , he helped us put them on and then changed his own clothing . Our discardedgarments he gathered up in a bundle and , disappearing in the underbrush , returned presently without it . Ben and I prepared to mount . But Hamet stopped us . " No , no ! " he said . " Wait here . I f anyone comes , hide in the tomb . " He turned away and , leading all three mounts , disappeared in the darkness , following a barely discernible pathway . " Hey ! " Ben exclaimed as he watched him go . " What the devil 's he up to now ? " " Your guess is as good as mine , " I replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What if he does n't come back ? " " He 'll be back , " I said . " I do n't know what he 's doing , but he has some reason for it . You 've got to trust him . " " I do n't trust any of these people , " he growled . Nevertheless he waited . There was nothing else to do . I will confess that my own faith was wavering when , at the end of several hours , he had not returned . The moon climbed higher , and Ben growled his dissatisfaction . " A pretty mess you 've got us into ! " he complained . " Like a : not he plans to help them find us and claim a reward ! " " Nonsense ! " I scoffed . " He 's trustworthy , and if he 's not , he 's well bought ! " However , I thought my own voice lacked conviction . " If he is n't here in another half hour I 'm off on my own , " Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Have patience ! " I told him . " Patience 1 " he scoffed . " What the hell d'ye think I 've had all these days ? We 'll never get there at this rate ! " I did not trouble to reply , but held my breath and listened.  |p303The  only sound that came to my ear was the chirping of insects in the night , the rattle of the palms above . It was nearly an hour before we heard the patter of small hoofs and a low , gruff voice saying : " Errrd ! " We drew back into the shadows , for neither of us had any stomach for entering the tomb . But a moment later Hamet , mounted upon a burro and driving three other shaggy little asses before him , rode into the clearing . Ben exploded . " Donkeys ! " he cried . " Does he expect us to ride those ? " Hamet slid off his mount beside us , and even in the moonlight I could see his grin . " ' What 's this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thy mounts , ya sidna , " he replied , " for our journey . " " But asses ! " I protested . " A beggar 's mount ! When we had horses ! " " No Moorish tabib would be able to afford a horse , " he explained , " especially such as those . In Morocco they might ride a mule . But here there are few mules . " " But the pursuit ? " I cried . " They will overtake us ! " " If they do , " he replied , " ye will look like what ye are supposedto be , and perhaps they will overlook ye . If ye rode horses ye would be conspicuous , and they would sec through thy disguise . But there will be no pursuit . " " No pursuit ? " I demanded . " What of the mameluke ? Think ye he will not stir them up ? " " Nay ! " he replied with a cryptic smile . " What mean ye ? " I cried . He made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend will risk punishment ? " I gulped . I had not contemplated anything quite as coldbloodedas this . Yet I should not have been surprised . " But they will discover it , " I said , " when we do not arrive at the palace . " " Thou'rt not expected there , " he replied , " and thyself ye hinted that thou mightest stay longer than a single day . It may be two , even three days ere thou'rt missed . By then we will be well on the road . They will not seek far for us , thou mayest be sure . There is no love for the bashaw and his soldiers where we go . "  | " That 's all very well , " I said , " but can we be sure it will happen so ? What if they miss us by morning ? " " Then they will search for us , " he agreed , " and thou mayest be sure that three rich Moors on fine horses would be remembered . But who will take heed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , my friends , it is not wise to make a display of wealth in the bled  --  neither wise nor safe ! " " But we are not wealthy , " I protested . " I would n't call this making a display ! " Hamet shrugged . " This  --  no , " he agreed . " But poverty to a townsman is riches to a beldi  --  a man of the back country . Who rides a horse will be thought rich , and him the Larbi will rob . If they think thee poor as they , they will take pity on thee and feed thee . Believe me , ya sidna , I know . " I saw that he was arguing to some purpose . I said so to Ben , who only snorted . Hamet chuckled . " Later , when we are better on the road , " he said , " and where it will be less noticed , we may change to camels . But for now , 0 gentlemen , it is better so . " I explained this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he growled . " Whatever you say . Let 's get on with it ! " Hamet glanced with some concern at the musket we had taken from our guard , and which Ben had not turned over with the rest of the uniform . " There is one thing , " he said . " What is that ? " I asked . " The gun , " he said . " It should be left behind . " I told Ben . He laughed without humor . " If he thinks I 'm going to leave it , he 's crazy , " he said . Hamet shrugged . " We will not need it except , " he said , " for defense . And if that need comes , of what use will one gun be ? " I explained this to Ben . He snorted . " Stuff ! " he exclaimed . " I 'm keeping it . Hamet can have the horses , but I want the gun . " I explained to Hamet , who seemed resigned . " It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can hide itp305if matters look bad , and it may be the means of finding some food . Come ! We can not lose more time here ! " He picked up the rest of our gear and stowed it in the flat cone-shaped panniers that each of the shaggy animals carried . After this he showed us how to sit our small steeds : either midships , with both legs draped over one of the animal 's shoulders , forward of the pannier ; or aft , sidewise upon the animal 's rump , with both heels hanging down together upon the same side so that they might , if occasion demanded , keep up a constant tattoo against his flank to keep him jogging along at his normal short-footed trot . A quarter of an hour later we were on our way , pattering along the winding trail through the nodding palms , and I for one was glad that we had chosen the night for our flight , for there was a trick to keeping one 's balance upon these diminutive beasts . An hour or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and long before dawn we were riding as if we had been accustomed to it all our lives . Our way lay to the south and slightly west , cutting back behind the city walls , threading between the low walls of the gardens , and keeping always beside one of the little shallow irrigation ditches . Every now and again we would pass another empty marabewt , or a silent well , the gaunt arms of its pulley rests standing like ghostly sentinels in the moonlight . Frequentlythe garden walls were topped with a dense hedge of Barbary fig , causing us to ride along silently in shadow . But the scents of lotus and hibiscus and gardenias and dung were as strong there as in the open light . As we came near the edge of the oasis the palms thinned out , and the gardens gave way to sandy scrub , and out beyond the trees we could begin to make out the sweeping outlines of the great dunes ; dun colored by daylight , but dull gold now in the shine of the moon , looking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and followed a dusty roadway , in which our burros ' feet made not a sound , westward , between the oasis and the towering sands . After a bit we came to a village , nestling at the edge of the palms , among the dunes ; here we turned again and bore to the south , outside the village walls . Hamet rode quietly back beside us to whisper , " Ain Zara . " At the end of the village , leading away to the southeast , between the dunes , we found a beaten track . This we followed among the sand hills , now sharp against the brilliance of the moonlit sands , now flitting like black ghosts through the only slightly blacker shadow of a dune . Underfoot our beasts made heavy going of the sand , but though we never climbed the crest of one of them , the way between the dunes seemed always to rise , until all at once we were through them , on solid ground once more , our donkeys ' hoofbeats pattering loudly in the silent night along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This gully we followed for a mile or more , to come suddenly out upon a vast upland which rolled away before us , rising imperceptibly into the distance , with never a sign of habitation ; an immense stretch of almost level , stony , ground , broken only here and there by a patch of low-growing brush or stunted shrubbery , bleak and cold in the wash of the moon . Only the little thin wisp of a trail broke it , winding away as far as we could see to lose itself in the distant hazy shadows . " The Jefara  --  the tableland , " Hamet told us . I turned and looked behind us , expecting to see the roofs and minarets of Tripoli . But they were hidden . Instead there was only the edge of the plain , and beyond that the tops of the palms reaching into the darkened distance , waving and tossing gently in the soft night breeze , like a black-and-silver sea in the moonlight . Somewhere to the south a jackal yelped , to be answered in the distance by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivered slightly and rode hastily after my companions . By dawn we had been on the road close to seven hours , by my best calculation , and had come something more than nine leagues . As the darkness which had followed the setting of the moon first turned pale and gray , and then fled before the advancing day , we found ourselves fairly adrift on the vast , almost level upland . On all sides of us it stretched without a break , stony and harsh , bleak gray and sear brown , for the most part , with here and there a thin patch of green or dusty yellow . Only in the south was there any break in the monotony . There , far ahead , like a vast , uptilted knife blade , the mistyblue , flat-topped ridge of the Jebel , the mountain , rose athwart our track against the pale sheen of the morning sky . Sparse brush , in patches as high as a man on horseback , but in the main no more than knee deep , studded the plain here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between , brown grass , and low-growing clumps of cactus , and numbers of little desert flowers managed what seemed to me a precarious foothold on the barren soil . To me it seemed desolate . I was not yet sufficientlyacquainted with Africa to appreciate how rich it was ! A few moments after it became light 1 lamet turned abruptly off the meandering track into a slight brush-grown depression , threading through the undergrowth until , in the center of the hollow , well hidden from the trail above , he halted in the shelter of a low , spreading argan bush and slipped from his mount . Both Ben and I were happy to follow his example . I for one felt as if every bone in my body had been ground under a millstone and all the splinters then replaced . It was evident that Ben was no better off . " Rest , " Hamet announced briefly . Ben and I sank to the ground , while Hamet fell to stripping the burros . Presently I found the strength to rise and help him . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cold shoulder of mutton . But before we could eat he spread his rug and knelt upon it facing the east . " Do as I do , " he commanded , " and repeat after me . " Ben roused himself from his weary lethargy momentarily . " What for ? " he demanded . Hamet eyed him , I thought , with some distaste . " Ye are not Mussulmen , sirs , " he explained , " but before we come to the end of this journey it will be necessary for ye to act as such many times . It is well then , now while we are not observed , to learn our morning and evening ritual . " Ben grumbled , but I silenced him , for it was evident that of all his bargain this was what Hamet regretted most . There followed our daily prayers to the east , and after a time , and some prompting and repetition , Hamet announced himself satisfied . " That is enough , " he said . " Remember ! If aught happens to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at intervals through the day . If thou canst not remember the words , thou mayest mumble them . But the movements must be followed exactly . Do not forget them ! Thy lives may depend upon it . " He served out our breakfast then and instructed us in the way we must eat , using only our right hands , for this , also , was the common custom . As we ate he told us something of the route we were to follow , which was south through the mountainsand then bearing east , keeping always back from the coast . " Why do n't we follow the coast road ? " Ben asked when I explained this to him . " Is n't that the usual way ? " Hamet nodded . " Aye , that is the usual way , and for that reason we do not follow it . That way will be searched . Moreover , it is the route of the army that has but lately marched . It will be traveled by couriers , passing to and from the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This route is longer , but it is also safer . " I saw the point and agreed . Ben was too weary to argue . " We sleep now , " Hamet announced , and wrapped himself in his blanket . Nor did Ben and I need any second hint . I awoke when the sun was high and the flies were thick upon my face . Hamet was already before me , replacing the panniers upon our animals , who showed less fatigue than any of us . Ben was difficult to arouse , but came , grumbling , at last from his blanket and stood up with an almost audible creaking . He groaned , and I knew how he felt . Hamet grinned . " It will soon work out , " he said . Ben only spat . We ate another handful of dates and an orange with difficulty , for the flies were so thick that it was all but impossible to keep them clear of the food for the instant necessary to convey it to our mouths . I fear I showed my disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . Make thyself accustomed to it and ignore them , else wilt thou mark thyself a stranger ! " It was about midmorning when we resumed our march , and now the track , which the night before had been deserted , had a fairly frequent passage of travel . About once in the hour we would meet a family or a party of beldi , or countryfolk , their belongings packed upon camels and asses , their old folk riding and their younger ones running barefoot , driving their sheep and their goats across the countryside , without regard to the trail . Now and again we met a smaller party , passing from group to group , riding upon asses or walking ; ragged folk , in the simplest homespun bournouses , and without a slipper to their name , yet seemingly happy . Unlike the townsfolk , thep309women were unveiled and bold , meeting glance for glance and exchanging banter for banter ; tattooed forehead , nose , and chin , but for the most part far from handsome . Here and there we passed black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half naked , and idlers , to run at our flanks and pass with us the time of day , and I wondered how we had chanced to miss these groups during our passage of the night until I realized that their camp sites were so chosen that in darkness they would not be evident . With all of these we passed greetings , and though I had had small confidence in my command of Arabic at our departure , I was amazed at the speed with which I fell into the habit of it . Nevertheless , Hamet was careful to halt at midday at a spot where we might take our food and our brief rest in private . At that time he chose to compliment me . " Ye do well , " he said . " Thou wilt have no difficulty . " By dusk we had reached the long wadis of the Jebel and had begun to climb between barren , rock-scarred slopes with a stream gurgling at our left amid a scattering of gnarled trees . Here Hamet turned again from the trail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some caves in the face of the mountain , where he announced we would pass the night . As darkness fell we could hear the hyenas laughing in the ravine above us , and the chatter of the apes upon the upper slopes kept company with the gurgle of the stream at our feet . But , though our bed was a ledge of rock and the musty smell of Africa lay like a hand upon us , I will confess that 1 , for one , slept as soundly as ever I did in a bed at home . In the morning we rose with the sun and pushed onward , climbing into the mountains , until , topping the ridge , we came upon the village of Tarhunah , a cluster of flat-roofed mud houses huddled togetherabout an open market place in the midst of a scattering of date palms and olive trees . We rested here only long enough to replenish our supplies of dates and figs , fearful lest we might be recognized . But nothinguntoward happened , although I noticed that several of the villagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toward noon we pushed on , and by nightfall found ourselves , after traversinga rugged , barren , up-and-down country , at Gasr ed Tenshuiah , a walled outpost composed of a mud castle and a cluster of hovels enclosed in a high , thick , mud-daubed wall in the midst of jagged mountain country . Until this point I had not been called upon to act my role of tabib . Now , however , being for the night among others , at the small fondouk where man and beast lay down together , it was necessary to account for my presence in one way or another . Consequently Hamet spread my fame about and fetched me several patients , with ailments extending from running sores to afflictions of the eyes . For these I prescribed various remedies : salves for both eyes and sores in the main , but now and again ordering burning for the sores and sheep 's , ass 's , or goat 's urine for the eyes  --  which Hamet informed me was often the custom of the country quacks . Ilere and there l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a malady which I recognized . Each treatment , whether sound or for effect , was accompanied by a pious incantation , and I must admit that both Hamet and Ben  --  the former by his vociferousness , and the latter by his evident awed silence  --  added much to the performance . The upshot was that we left the caravanserai the next morning at dawn , in company with some folk bound for Bir el ' jar , with something of a reputation , although I observed that there were here again a few who eyed Ben 's musket with some covetousness . Nevertheless we were not molested that day , during which we got some leagues to the south and eastward of Gasr ed Tenshuiah , over rugged , precipitous country , before we camped in a gorge of the Oued Maader . The next morning , bidding farewell to our companions , who turned off to the west , we continued to Graret Darbuc , another small walled village and mud castle , where we spent another night . From here it was still another long day 's journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orfella , a bright valley spotted with oases of date palms and green with new fields of barley and young corn between the rock-crested hills . Here at last Hamet breathed easily . " From here , " he announced , " we need not fear pursuit . These people are not friendly to the bashaw 's deputies , and they will not follow us here . Only the dangers of the road lie before us . " He did not enlarge upon this , but it seemed to me that theip311people we encountered here were little different from those we had met in the mountains . They were a little better fed and less wary , but they had the same difficulties . Three men came to me with carbuncles , which I burned , having learned by now that the harsher the treatment the surer the cure in their simple eyes , actual cautery being regarded as the sovereign remedy for all external ills save those of the eve . Despite Hamet 's optimism , however , our difficulties increasedfrom this point onward ; though , as he predicted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulid to Bu Njem was a five days ' journey under the best conditions . We needed eight . Our first day led us across flat uplands and over the green gullies of three sizable wadis . But not long before dusk we encountered a cloudburst which so swelled the Wadi Soffeghinthat it was questionable whether we should attempt to cross . Since we had not long before passed a party of Bedaween , Hamet was determined , if possible , to put the river between us and them , and accordingly we drove into it , Hamet leading the spare animal , carrying our food and blankets , while Ben and I followed close behind . All might have been well had we been able to keep to the ford , but the swift current and high water had washed it away in one spot , and all at once we found ourselves floundering in the current and , all three of us , being swept swiftly downstream . Ben managed to save himself by clinging to his ass 's tail , as Hatnet shouted to us to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half dragging my beast by its lead rope and half clinging to it for support . Hamet clung to a pannier upon his own beast and so came safely to the far shore , but not without losing his hold on the lead rope of the pack burro , which , heavily laden , was swept down in the turgid yellow stream and lost . Nor did all our search along the bank reveal the least sign of him . We spent a cold , supperless night by the river ; Hamet bewailedhis fortune , while I , in my naivete , counted our blessings . To be sure , we had lost our provisions and our blankets , and the earthen jug of water that the spare beast had carried . But we still had a small kettle and all our personal belongings . My medicines and instruments were still in the pannier on my own burro , and Ben still had his musket and a hornful of dry powder , the stopper of which had remained tight during his ducking , not to mention a reasonable supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor had water , and since I still retained the bulk of my money in my belt about my waist I felt we would have no trouble getting on to Bu Njem , where we should be able to re-equip . Long before morning , however , my empty stomach was crying out in protest , and when , in the dark hour before dawn , Hamet rolled over and woke me , bidding me rise and follow him , I was glad enough to do so without question . In the darknessI did not see him take the musket and powder horn and shot pouch from Ben  --  who never once stirred  --  until he had straightened and I saw the tip of the piece against the blueblackof the sky . " Where arc we going ? " I asked . " To get food before we starve , " he replied . He led me upstream in the gradually graying dawn , evidentlysearching for something upon the ground . Presently he grunted and showed me a well-beaten path that came down to the water 's edge . " Stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the river , and below the track . If anything comes to drink , do not show yourself until they break . Then , if they run toward you , rise and fling these clubs among them . Throw for their legs . " He armed me with three or four clubs cut from a thornwood tree , each about three or four feet in length . " What shall I expect ? " I asked . But he was already gone , climbing the escarpment above the riverbank . I did as he told me , lying close hidden amid the brush for what seemed to me hours before a small herd of gazelles appearedupon the runway and came down toward the river to drink . The sight of them excited me , and I was about to rise and rush toward them , when a shot from above startled the animals . One of them tumbled in the pathway , and the rest turned sharply away from the sound and came leaping and bounding toward me in such prodigious jumps that for an instant I was too startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wits they were upon me , and I rose up , scattering them in all directions and twirling my clubs , let fly where they were thickest.  |p313One  of my weapons caught one of the graceful little beasts in the ribs and tumbled him momentarily to the ground , where I flung myself upon him . Another club apparently cut squarely across the legs of a third , for Hamet presently appeared holdingup that one and the one he had shot , and assisted me in subduing the one that I had fallen upon  --  no small task , for his horns and his hoofs were sharp as razors and I had rents in both myself and my clothing by the time I was relieved . By this means we had meat for this day and the next , as well as the day following , for the animals were about the size of a large hound , with meat of a texture similar to venison , only more delicate . On the third night , however , we woke just as an overbold jackal slipped into camp and made off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were left with neither meat nor water , the river in which we had lost our ass being the last we had crossed , and our lone remaining water bag beingnow empty . Thus we were in sorry straits throughout our fourth day , and we began to know something of the torment of thirst on the land , which is different from thirst at sea in that it is not possiblethere even to wet one 's hands and face . To add to our difficulties , the character of the country had changed almost mockingly , and we now found ourselves in a region where the tawny sand of the dunes was only briefly interspersed with rocky , treeless barrens in which the only living things we saw were snakes and scorpions and lizards and an occasional vulture . About midmorning of the fifth day we calve to a tiny oasis , a mere cluster of palms , in the midst of the rocks , with a spring of water bubbling up in the middle of it . Imagine my disgust , however , when we found the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six inches deep under their squirming bodies . Ben , too , was repelled . But Hamet gave out a whoop of delight . I stared at him in amazement . " Jeraada ! " he cried . " We will not starve , at least ! " Taking up Ben 's musket , he directed us to gather sticks for a fire . When we returned he had shredded a few rags and , with powder from Ben 's horn , had made of them squills to serve as tinder . He placed a handful of sticks over these and , flash- ing the lock of the gun into them , set a quick little fire . Then he took our remaining small kettle and scooped up a kettleful of the squirming locusts from the spring and put them on to boil . After they had steamed for a few moments he lifted the pot from the fire and offered it to us . I thought Ben would be ill . " I 'm not hungry enough for that ! " I said . " Try ! " he grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert . Thou'lt find it not bad . " " No , thank you ! " I replied . He shrugged and pulled the pot toward himself and , dipping in gingerly , selected a large insect . Carefully he stripped away legs and wings and popped the creature in his mouth , chewing with an almost offensive crackling and a grin that said we were plain fools if we did not follow his example . I rose and walked away , unable to watch , but after a momentmy hunger and loneliness drew me back , and as I approachedI saw Ben reach out for the pot . As I sat down , quietly , not far from him , he glanced at me and drew back , hesitating ; then , almost defiantly , he reached out again and selected a good-sized locust , peeled it as he had seen Hamet do , and thrust it into his mouth . I expected to see him spit it out instantly , but instead a look of ludicrous amazement spread across his face . He gave me a startled glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took another of the creatures , followed by another and another . For a few moments I watched him in utter wonder , and then , unable longer to deny either my curiosity or my hunger , I too reached out and picked up an insect as big as a mouse . With the greatest distaste I peeled away legs and wings and took a bite of it . To my intense surprise it was meaty and crisp and had somewhat the flavor of a prawn . Hastily I gulped the rest of it and reached for another . Within half an hour we had emptied the pot and Hamet had put a second on to boil . " I 'm damned ! " exclaimed Ben . " I 'm damned ! If anyone had told me a while ago that I would eat grasshoppers and like ' em , I 'd have called ' em crazy ! ! But d'ye know , " he added , turning to me , " they 're most as good as a trout ! " " They 're better fried in olive oil with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hamet chuckled . " A pity we have none ! "  | " How did it happen ye knew this ? " I asked . " In my country , which is at the edge of the desert , " he shrugged , " when the jeraada come there is nothing else to eat . " We rested the balance of that day and night in the tiny oasis and felt that our troubles were over when we managed to snare a half dozen rabbits . A porridge of locusts and stewed rabbit gave us strength for the next day 's journey , while the palms of the oasis yielded us a near half pannierful of dates . Using the hides of the two gazelles , which we still had left after the jackal 's thievery , Hamet fashioned a rude water bottle , so that with that and the goatskin we felt prepared to push on . On the seventh day , in the evening , as luck would have it , we came at dusk to an encampment of Bedaween in the single oasis which we encountered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised us to ride boldly in and bid them a proper good night . We followed him down from the high dunes , feeling not at all certain of our reception , and rode among the black goatskin tents , giving greetings here and there to silently staring folk as we passed in the direction of the wells . Once among them , I confess I also had doubts , for these were none of the half-farmer-half-nomad people that we had thus far encountered . I saw , too , that I lamer was also afraid . These were what he called Laurbi  --  desert folk  --  lean , warlike men with sharp , alert eyes , who masked their faces in blue cloth against the sun and wore little but breeches and a haik for clothing . They eyed us with ill-concealed suspicion . At the wells , obeying Hamet to the letter , we halted and , after making our obeisances to Mecca , we set about quietly to make camp . A few of our neighbors gathered about , no move of ours escaping their sharp eyes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently a tall one , better clothed than the rest , appeared from among them and squatted before our fireside . This was the moment , I felt , for which f needed all my wits , for Hamet had warned me that I would be expected to take the lead . " The blessing of Allah on thee , " I said . " And on thy people , " he responded punctiliously . He glanced about our camp , and I offered him a bit of the stew we were eating , apologizing that we had no better .   He dipped in his hand politely and ate , asking at the same time if I had no tea . I told him what had happened . He grunted and dipped again into our pot . " Thou'rt strange to these parts ? " he asked . " I am a tabib of Morocco , bound on the hadj , " I replied . " These are my slave and my servant , whom I have from Tafilet . " This was what Hamet had told me to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded acceptance . " Ye travel in poor circumstances , " he said . " Have ye come all the way so ? " I thanked God then that we had rehearsed every possible situation as we rode across the empty desert . " We were robbed in el Jefren , " I replied . " Only by grace of the kaid of el Garian did we escape with our lives ! " " They are thieves , el Jefreni , " he agreed . " Ye have done well to come so far , blessed is the name of Allah ! " " Bismillah 1  --  in the name of God ! " I replied piously . His eye fell upon Ben 's musket . " A handsome gun ! " I reached over and picked it up . " It is thine I " I replied . He took it in his hands and bowed ceremoniously . " God 's peace be on thee ! " he said . " And on thy people peace , " I replied . He rose , holding the weapon in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In God 's mercy will I call upon thee , " I answered . Hamet gave me a quick nod as he disappeared in the darkness . " Go to his tent , " he said , " and eat what he puts before thee . We will be taken care of . " " What about my gun ? " Ben growled . " It would be taken from thee in any case , " Hamet told him . " But I think ye will find its equal returned . " I confess to a sense of misgiving as I went , but I was surprised to find the sand of the oasis , under the rough goatskin tent , laden with rich carpets and lighted with lamps of argan oil . My host was seated upon the rug , much more richly dressed than when I last saw him .   " My house be thine , " he remarked as I entered . " Daif Allah  --  the guest of God , " I replied , which bound him to our protection as long as we were within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I had not had since leaving Tripoli . Indeed , it was such as I had seldom eaten before . Gazelle and mutton , couscous and barley formed the principal course , followed by corn and honey , and a paste of sweetened gum afterward , which was entirely new to me . We ate with ceremony , served , not by male slaves , but by women unveiled , who were no beauties but who met the eye steadily and who smelled rankly of rancid sheep 's grease . I was careful to behave as Hamet had taught me , and apparentlyI passed muster , for the kaid , my host , asked me if I could cure his son of boils . When I replied that I could , he brought in a youth whose face was marked with the usual eruptionsof his age . These I touched lightly with the hot iron , more for the appearance than for any actual effect , and thereafteranointed them with a salve of euphorbium resiniferum , which is native to the desert , and assured him that if he repeated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all trace of the eruption would he gone in a matter of time . In the morning our host came to bid us farewell , and as a parting present gave us twenty ducats in gold and two fit-clocks , guns to be sure , requiring the touch of a match to set them off , but nonetheless firearms , and by that token twice what we had surrendered to him . For my own part I thought the exchange well worth making , although Ben grumbled at the antiquity of the pieces . These were above suspicion , while the other bore the bashaw 's stamp and , had we met any of his people , might have led us into difficulties . In addition the kaid himself supplied us with directions to Bu Njem and enjoined us to notify him if we met with any molestation , swearing that he would avenge us if he could not rescue us . Upon this promise of friendship we parted . I left that place much cheered , for it seemed to me that the people of the desert were not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not three hours from Bu Njem when we fell in with a different sort . In the course of following up a rocky wadi to the plain upon which the city stood , we found ourselves suddenly confronted , seemingly from out of the barren rocks themselves , by a half a score of Arabs in ragged caftans , who barred our road before and behind and to the flanks , with clubs in hand , and demanded who we were , whence we came , and whither we went . Hamet turned gray and appeared to lose all power of speech at sight of them , whereat I , to the best of my ability , answered that we were pilgrims from Morocco , under the protection of the kaid of Er Recha , our late host , and bound for Bu Njem . At this they seemed unimpressed , and one of them reached suddenlyfor the musket which Ben carried slung across his shoulder . Ben drew back and struck out with his fist , whereupon they fell on us in a body , beating us with their cudgels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripping the clothing from our bodies . Their onslaught was not altogether unexpected . I was surprised to see Hamet tumble from his mount and cover his head with his arms , whilst three of the ruffians whacked the dust from his back with their staves . But more than this I had little chance to observe , for their spokesman came at me , and I was obliged to put my foot in his stomach . Then , tumbling off my ass , I bounced up with a handful of stones , which I flung in his face . As I did so I saw Ben whip out his knife and bury it in the throat of his assailant , while simultaneously it seemed to me the man 's staff caught him alongside the head , opening his cheek from mouth to ear . My own opponent came back at me at this instant , and I saw no more of what my companions were doing for a moment . But there is no question but that , despite our resistance , they must ultimately have overpowered us and stripped us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our late host 's , sent to see that we came safely to Bu Njem , arrived and sent them packing . They left one of their number  --  the one that had felt Ben 's knife in his throat  --  dead upon the field . But we , on our side , were not without losses . In fleeing they took both of the muskets that we had been given , as well as Hamet 's burro with all of his belongings . Ben had the ragged cut I had seen him receive and a rapidly closing eye , and I was myself conscious of a spreading nose and a couple of loose teeth . But Hamet appeared the worst sufferer of us all , for he lay face down upon the pathway , kicking his toes in the dust and scrabbling in theP319gravel with his fingers . Alarmed , I endeavored to turn him over and knelt beside him , while our rescuers gathered about us . " Aieee ! " he wailed , and I feared his ribs were broken , wherefore I handled him with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " Aieee ! " he groaned again . " Give me thy knife that I may end my misery ! " " No , man ! " I cried . " It can not be so bad as that . Tell me where it hurts worst , and I will tell thee what I can do . " He rolled over and sat up abruptly . " Can I tell thee that ? " he cried . " Am I not ground to little pieces within my guts ? " I grew alarmed at that , thinking that he had sustained some inward injury , and tried to press him back . But he would have none of this . Instead he seized a handful of dust and poured it upon his head . " Woe is my lot I " he cried . " Allah has visited this upon me ! " " What is it , man ? " I cried . " Can ye ask ? " he cried . " Am I not destitute once more ? Have I not been robbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my money ? What is left to me but the clothes I stand in ? " I could not help myself , I began to laugh . He glared at me resentfully . " Ye think it a matter for laughing ? " I sobered instantly . " I laugh , " I told him , " for relief . I thought it so much worse ! Come , man ! We have our lives and two asses , and I have yet all that I brought from " Tripoli . Bu Njem is no great distance . There we will find other mounts and I will make up to thee all that thou hast lost ! " What our friends of the Ouled Recha thought I am not prepared to say , but it was all the tonic Hamet needed . He scrambled to his feet and wrung my hand and then fell to dustinghimself off gingerly . " Every bone in my body is broken ! " he complained . " If thou hast more than bruises I will trade skins with thee , " I told him dryly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flow of his blood and binding his cut . Thereafter we resumed our journey , taking turns upon our two remaining burros and escorted byP320our rescuers , whom I took care to reward , to Bu Njem , which we reached a full hour before sundown . We lay four days at Bu Njem , a desert city at the northernmostedge of the Fezzan , considering our next step . Hamet was for striking northeastward to the coast , there to follow the road into Cyrenaica , whence we might again strike toward the east and pass around the bashaw 's expedition , which was rallying at Derne . He gave as reason for this a tribe called the Senussi , which he apparently held in great fear . For my part , I preferred the Senussi to the bashaw 's people . It was my plan to go directly cast a prudent distance , keeping away from the coast , then to turn northward to the sea somewhereeast of Derne , where we might either join General Eaton or continue eastward into Egypt as might best suit our case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I who had the last word , and we proceeded to dispose of our burros and undertook to hire camels for the rest of the way . This was easier planned than done . The cameleers of the city seemed as frightened by the Senussi as Hamet . Had I been wise , I suppose , I should have settled the matter by buying the animals and proceeding independently . But a good camel is not cheap , and this seemed to me an unnecessary expense . Moreover , I knew nothing of the beasts , and it seemed to me that advantage would easily be taken . Nevertheless I was determined that we should have them . I was done with traveling in poverty . On camels we would ride in comparative luxury , coveringas much distance in a single day as we would on asses in. three . We could carry enough provisions to see us to the end of our journey . And if we were set upon by thieves , we would have at least a chance of outrunning them . I was emphatically supported in this by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but who had also had his fill of dawdling . I had almost come to the decision to buy the animals if need be when , on our third evening in the town , a villainous looking Arab presented himself at our fondouk and asked for el Tabib Moghrebbin , by which he meant me . Hamet was absent at the moment , seeking camels , so I could not call upon him ; accordingly , I greeted my caller after the Moslem fashion , at which I was by now fairly adept , and invitedhim in . After the customary coffee and the usual floweryP321compliments , I gradually found means to ask him his business , thinking that no doubt it had to do with my profession . Instead he said that he had heard that we were contemplating continuingour journey to the east and were in search of transport . His name , he told me , was Ahmed Ben Khali Ibn Abd er Rahman , and he had lately arrived in the city and learned that a wealthy tabib of the west  --  on whom be peace  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I let the question of wealth pass for the moment and assured him that I was indeed in search of the means of continuing my journey , but that , for reasons of my own , I wished to avoid the usual route through Benghazi and Derne . When I asked if he thought this were possible and what it would cost , he cast up his eyes to the ceiling and calculated and finally named a price that , as I had expected , was out of all reason . We descended then to the haggling , without which no bargainis ever struck in those parts , and over innumerable cups of coffee and a quantity of sweetmeats we dickered backward and forward , exchanging the vilest of insults , as is also customary , until , in the end , I made him a price beyond which I would not go . At this point Hamet appeared , and my guest rose to take his leave , saying he would bring me his answer in the morning . When he was gone llama turned to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this man ? " I explained to him the circumstances and he spat . " Arbil " he exclaimed . " Ile is a thief . I do not trust him ! " " Aye ! " I cried . " He is an Arab , and undoubtedly a thief . But he offers what we need and must have . " " But the price , " Hamet protested . " It is too high ! " " It is high , " I agreed , " but have we a choice ? We must get on ! I am willing to pay ! " " It is too much ! " he argued . " I agree , " I replied . " But I do not mean to spend my days in Bu Njem ! " " I do not trust him , " he growled , falling back upon his first argument . " No more do I , " I said , " but what can he do ? No doubt he knows I am no more Moorish doctor than he , but there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , " he replied .   " Nonsense ! " I scoffed . " He is as afraid of the Senussi as thyself . Our common dread will drive us together . What if I pay him something more than he is worth ? Once he is on the road he will go through with it , if only because he must ! " " Didst tell him that thou bast thy gold on thee ? " " I said nothing of where I carried my wealth , " I replied , adding with a laugh , " If ye call it wealth ! A thief he may be , but he is at least astute enough to know that his reward will be greater for bringing us through safely than for leaving us in the desert . " " Thou'rt more confident than I , " he said lugubriously . " Ye start at shadows I " I laughed . " May it not be the shadow of death ! " he said piously . With that we left it . In the morning Ahmed Ben Khali called upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the terms I had set . Ben was jubilant . " Now we 're getting on ! " he cried . " I thought you 'd never make sense ! " " If I make sense now , " I told him coldly , " as far as you are concerned , it is only because I am in this as deep as you . " " If it were n't for me you 'd be still a prisoner , " he retorted , " and God knows when you 'd be free , if ever ! " " We 're not free yet , " I reminded him . " Sidna ! Sidna ! " Hamet protested uneasily . " If we quarrel amongst ourselves , how can we meet our enemies ? " Even Ben was shamed to silence by that . We left Bu Njem , not that day , but upon the morning following , after trying , in vain , to obtain arms of some description . Muskets in that region commanded a higher price than camels . As for pistols , they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben and myself , Ahmed Ben Khali , and four " cousins " who were his assistants . Hamet protested , but Ahmed swore they were necessary . " We must return by the same route , " he said , " and a small party is not safe . " I was inclined to agree with Hamet but saw no worse in it than that they meant to make as much advantage of a good thing as possible , and certainly , I felt , there was safety in numbers . And so I did not protest more than halfheartedly , al-P323though a more villainous-seeming crew I hope I may never see again . Despite their evident villainy , however , we made excellent going at first . Our route followed the line of the black rock mountains , the Jebel Welad Hasan , the Jebel Es Suda , and the Jebel Morai Yeh , whose successive ridges towered upon our right flank and shut us off from the endless steppes of the Fezzan . The road we followed lay through barren , rocky country , in which , oftentimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a hummock of grass to break the hot expanse of stone and shale . In such country even a sand dune was a welcome diversion , and the intensity with which the sun beat down upon the bare rocks soon taught me why the people of this region rode with faces veiled . On the second night we stopped at el Khadder , a cluster of scrawny palms grouped about a stinkingpuddle of water scooped in the rocks and by courtesy called a well . On the next we were at Mrada , a more extensive oasis at the end of the rock country . Beyond this we entered the region of seemingly eternal sand , where we rode as if through a petrified sea , over wave after wave of wind-whipped dune , only now and again coming upon a tiny pocket of palms in the hollow of the sand hills , where a little water oozed up about the roots and the dung of all manner of desert beasts strewed the edges of the pools . At first it was weary riding , so different was it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they walked , which was seldom , the camels had a sort of racking pitch which threatened to snap our necks where they joined our spines . When they ran , which was much of the time , at a long swinging trot , it was like being tossed about on a bouncing pole . But one grew accustomed to it , learned to swing with the movement , and while I could never learn to love it , or even to pretend that I enjoyed it , I at least learned to endure it in silence . On the fifth day , after a dry camp , we pressed on across an endless sea of sand , with the hot breath of the syroc upon our necks and the last vestiges of the mountains left far behind . About midday we passed a long caravan , escorted by blueveiledriders , who eyed us with hostile suspicion . I noticed that they wore neither the bournous of the Tripolines nor the djellab , such as we , as Moors , wore , but rather had on a sort of fine woolen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later as an aba . On their heads , above the blue veils which covered their faces except for their eyes , they wore what looked like a species of low turban , bound round with cords of black goat 's hair , and the eyes they turned upon us , following us as we passed , were bright black and sharply unfriendly . My companionsseemed nervous and apprehensive as we passed among them , and for some time afterward I noticed Ben Khali casting quick glances backward and around the southern horizon . When I asked him what troubled him , however , he only gave me a sheepish glance and a mumbled answer , of which the only word I could understand was , " Senussi . " That night we continued our journey until almost dusk , stopping at last at a tiny oasis called Bir el Ghodran , where , when the hour for supper arrived , our companions drew a little apart from us with their meal and presently fell to arguing violently among themselves in tones so low that we could not catch a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoinedus , sitting down cross-legged before our small fire , and sipped the coffee we offered him ; a man with something on his mind . At last I could bear this no longer , so I wrung the tail of the devil , as the saying is , and asked what troubled him . He shook his head ominously . " This is a bad journey , " he said . " We  --  my cousins and I  --  now wish that we had not undertaken it . " " Nonsense ! " I exclaimed . " What do ye fear ? " " Fear ? " he cried angrily , and I saw his hand move beneath his bournous . " Who dares to call Ben Khali afraid ? " I spat into the fire , though my throat felt suddenly dry , and Ben and Hamet sat across from me like statues . " Take thy hand from thy dagger , Ben Khali , " I managed to growl . " Ye gain nothing with bluster . What is it ye want ? " I thought he relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senussi , " he growled . " Aye , " I agreed noncommittally . " We should have passed further north  --  by the coast road . " " Ye knew the road we were to follow before we started , " I replied abruptly . " If ye were afraid or unwilling to take it , then was the time to say so  --  not now , when we are half over it . "   " We did not think then of the Senussi , " he said . This was such an obvious lie that I did not even deign to answer it , but merely grunted in derision . He scowled . " My cousins wish to turn back . " I shrugged . " The jackal starts at his own shadow , " I said , " and not even Allah can stop him ! " He cast his eyes toward the heavens , as if calling upon the stars to witness that he was an honest , patient man , trying to advise me to my own good , but that I was too stubborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid , " he explained carefully . " It is only that they see no profit in it . " " Their profit , " I replied , " is a matter to be agreed upon betweenye . Our agreement was between thee and me . " " That is true , " he nodded . " But it is this which troubles them : What if we are set upon by the Senussi and aught happens to thee ? Then , do ye not see it , they have all their trouble and danger for naught . " " Not , " I prompted him , " unless the same fate befalls thee . " " If I could but show them some gold , " he sighed , " I might persuade them to go on . " " I paid thee a third of thy hire before we left , " I replied . " Why not give them their share of that ? " He stared at me . " That ! " he exclaimed . " " That was all spent for supplies . I have none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " I said . He pursed his lips , as if he found it hard to bear with my obtuseness . " If thou wouldst pay us now what ye owe us , " he said , " I will answer for my cousins that they will complete the journey . " I stared at him . " I owe thee ? " I cried . " Ben Khali , thou knowest our agreementI One third to be paid in advance , and the rest on arrival at our destination ! I owe thee naught until that day ! " " Pay us half , " he countered . " I will pay thee naught , " I cried , " until the appointed time ! " He rose with a shrug . " I can not answer , then , for what my cousins will do . "  | " Tell thy cousins , " I replied , " that if they ever expect aught of me they will continue their journey to its end ! " It was Ben who burst out when he had gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of the language to be able to understand some of what had been said . " The dirty swine ! " he cried . " I knew they were up to some deviltry . By God , you did not encourage him , Tom ? " " Did it look to you that I had ? " I demanded . Hamet only shook his head . " Did I not warn thee ? " he said . " What 's to do ? " Ben demanded . " Do ? " I cried . " Why , nothing but stand firm ! " Hamet leaned forward abruptly . " If we are wise , this is what  --  c will do , " he said in a low tone . " Wait until they sleep . Then slit their throats . " I stared at him aghast . As much as I learned about these people , I was never able to accept their complaisant attitude toward treachery . " That 's murder 1 " I protested . He looked at me as if I were half-witted . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nonsense ! " I cried . " They 're merely trying to bluff us . If we stand firm they will carry out their bargain . " Hamet sighed and turned away , offering no further argument , and presently we retired to our blankets . I slept but fitfully that night , something of Hamet 's unease sticking in my mind . From time to time I started awake and roused up , glancing to see that all was quiet . But each time all was serene . In the morning we breakfasted and the packs were filled and made fast , quite as if nothing had happened . When we mounted and set out , however , instead of turning toward the east , in the direction we had been traveling , Ahmed Ben Khali calmly turned his beast 's head back along the trail we had but just followed and started back the way we had come . " Where are you going ? " I cried . " This is the way ! " Ben Khali halted and turned about to eye me gravely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I , " he replied . It was at this point that I made my gravest blunder . " Wait ! " I cried , feeling helpless . " Come back ! Let us not be too hasty ! Let us discuss the matter further . " P327Without going into the interminable haggling that followed , the long and short of it was that I agreed to pay them , then and there , half the sum remaining , and to allow an additional sum for each " cousin " upon arrival at the coast . With this they appeared satisfied , and I , in all innocence , counted out the gold upon a blanket and paid it over . When we were once again upon our road 1 lancet , with a grave face , found occasion to draw back alongside of me , imperceptibly shaking his head . " It were better if ye had not done that , " he said . " Why ? " I said . " We are upon the way again , and they are happy . It is nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a small bite was no more than I expected . " He shrugged . " Aye , " he said , " but the thief who steals a little will steal more if he sees the opportunity , and they know now that ye carry gold with ye . It will be wise to keep a close watch from here on . Let thy hand be never far from thy knife ! " I told myself that this was nonsense , yet at the midday halt they drew apart again and put their heads together . Though they said nothing further at that time , I knew then that Hamet was right and that we had not heard the end of the business . Yet when we resumed our journey I was almost persuaded that I was starting at shadows , so cheerful and friendly were they . We pushed on , making excellent time despite the sharp upand-downnature of the going , until late afternoon , when our shadows leaped before us from the western crests of the dunes , like those of beasts on stilts , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air . It was near dusk , and we were yet far from any oasis , when Ahmed Ben Khali halted in a deep hollow between two dunes and forced his mount to kneel . " What are we stopping for ? " I demanded , suddenly alert . He shrugged as he slid to the ground . " It is yet far to Bir es Zitoun , " he replied . " It is well to take here some refreshment . " There was nothing in this suggestion to arouse my suspicions , for it was often our practice to take tea and to eat a few dates in the afternoon when it was likely that we would be traveling late into the night . Nothing untoward happened until the tea had been brewed and served and we were lifting our glasses to our lips , when Ahmed Ben Khali spoke . " Give us the gold ye carry , " he said , " and we will bring ye safe to the coast . " Even then , I think , I might have bargained , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before me . " Oh , thief ! " he cried , dashing his glass of hot tea in El Khali 's face , and started to his feet with knife half drawn . Out of the corner of my eye I saw Mustapha and Idris fling themselves upon him , their blades flashing in the last rays of the sun , and I , too , started up , fumbling for my weapon . But I had not gained my knees when the sky seemed to fall upon my neck . The dunes and the camels and my companions all seemed to merge in a vast whirling explosion , turning to bright lights and flashes and then into darkness . I felt myself plunge forward with a great weight upon me . For an instant I struggled , and then a second blow fell and everything seemed to draw away , leaving me floating in a vast vacuum as black as the night of hell . It seemed to me no more than an instant that I lay so , floating in the darkness . Yet when I opened my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold sand , with a sound of diabolical laughter ringing in my ears . When I moved , raisingmyself upon my hands , a wave of nausea and pain sent me spinning back into oblivion , and I collapsed once more upon the sand , where I lay weakly , half between living and dying , until gradually , over what time I had no conception , I came slowly back and became fleetingly conscious of stealthy patteringsabout me . For a long time , it seemed to me , I lay , overcome by a great lassitude . But after a time I opened my eyes and cautiously raised up on hands and knees , and then wearily turned over and sat . It was dark . The skies overhead were like a purple blanket studded with jewels . But there was no moon . I glanced about , though each movement of my head set it to spinning , and abruptly encountered a warm , slavering breath and was conscious of a sound as of panting . Almost in my ear the screaming laughter rang out again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indiscriminately toward the sound . ThereP329was again a noise of pattering flight , and the scream was repeatedfrom a greater distance . I shook my head and struggled to my knees . " Ben ! " I cried . " Ben ! Hama ! " I was answered by a groan , which seemed to come from my left . Gingerly I felt my way in that direction and presently came upon a body which stirred under my touch . " Who 's that ? " I cried , and recoiled abruptly . I was answered only by another groan . Gradually something of my position crept in upon my consciousness . I ran trembling hands across my body and found myself naked as the day I was born . For a moment I crouched where I was , until I heard a faint stirring before me , and , my eyes growing a little accustomed to the night , I made out the dark figure of a man against the lighter background of the sand . Gingerly I turned him over . He stirred and fought feebly . " Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " The response was no more than a half-grunted moan . " Unh  --  aaahhh ! " " Ben ! " I cried again . " Ben ! ' T is me , Tom ! " He sighed heavily . " Tooommm ! " Behind me I heard the scrabbling sound once more and turned and flung another handful of sand . When I turned back Ben was sitting up . " Tom ? " he said . " Here ! " I replied . " What happened ? " I sat back and pondered that for a moment , for my own head was still spinning . " They attacked us , " I said . " Have they left you aught ? " There was a moment 's silence , then his reply . " I 'm naked as a babe ! " " And I , " I said . " Where 's Hamet ? " he asked . I raised up on my knees and stared about , trying to penetrate the night with my eyes , and abruptly was conscious of a dark huddle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ominous sound of slobbering and champing . With a cry I rose to my feet and stumbled toward it , flinging sand as I went , and the dark mass parted with angry snarls and gray shapes slunk off into the dark , leaving one only behind them . Beside this I fell on my knees and thrust out my hands , to encounter a mass of cold viscera from which I recoiled in shock . " Ben ! " I cried . " Ben ! He 's here ! He  --  he 's dead ! " Laboriously Ben struggled to his feet and stumbled over beside me . " Dead ! " he whispered . " Dead ? " " Dead ! " I replied with emphasis . There was a long silence . " What are we to do ? " he whispered finally . " What , Tom ? " " I do n't know ! " I answered . " I do n't know ! " I HAVE NO IDEA how long we squatted there facing one another across that still , shapeless form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the situation in which we found ourselves . From time to time we would snatch up a handful of sand and , turning , fling it at the hyenas that skulked in the background , lacking the courage to come in so long as we defied them . Presently the moon rose and cast a thin white light over the desert , so that we were able to see one another and the thing  --  it was now little else  --  that lay between . " Are we to die here in the desert ? " Ben whispered finally . Something within me rebelled at the thought . " No ! " I cried . " What then ? " he sobbed . His evident despair acted somehow like a tonic on me . " I do n't know , " I said . " But I 'll not stay here to die ! I 'm going on ! " " Do n't leave me ! " he begged . " Come with me , then ! " I cried . " Where ? " he asked . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but I 've no mind to rest here and wait ! "  |p331He  staggered upright . " You lead , " he said . " I 'll follow . " " We 'll bury him first , " I replied . " What 's the use of that ? " he demanded . I shrugged . " ' T is the least we can do . " We scooped out a hollow in the sand , as deep as we could make it , and turned in the shapeless mess that had been our friend and companion . " Should we say a prayer ? " Ben asked . I was surprised he would think of it . " I do n't know how Moslems bury their dead , " I replied thoughtfully . " But I 'll do my best ! " " Please ! " he muttered . " Allah befriend this friend of the friendless ! " I whispered in Arabic . " Lend him thine hand to Paradise and to the rest of good men . May his soul never weary ; may he dwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gehenna , for his heart was that of the lion and his goodness that of the dove . May thy face not turn from him , and may thy hand guide him through the life that is to follow ! " " Amen ! " said Ben in English . " May he rest happy ! " He settled back upon his heels and looked at me . " Which way ? " he asked . " East ! " I replied promptly . " The way we were going 1 " He shrugged . " If we are to die , it may as well be on the road ! " " Yes ! " I said , and stood up . I was glad , then , that I had attended Mr. Porter 's lectures on navigation in the prison , not that I knew enough to find our position upon a chart , but at least I knew cast from west and was able to tell from the stars in which direction to go . At the top of the first dune I made Ben sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort to learn the extent of his wounds , fearing a knife stab that might fester and weaken him beyond such help as I might give . Fortunately , however , he , like myself , appeared to be more bruised and battered than wounded . Apparently our assailants had struck with sufficient swiftness to put us out of the fighting before we could arm ourselves , and so we had been left to die where we lay without1 further trouble on their part . Whether this was a curse or a blessing I had yet to decide . All that night we stumbled eastward , through the deep sands , up the back of each round-shouldered dune , sliding and scramblingand then slipping down the face of it . Exercise kept us warm , and determination kept us moving . Yet when the dawn came we might simply have walked a treadmill . From horizon to horizon the desert stretched , dune upon rolling dune , with never a splash of green to break the monotony . Nevertheless , although I was fully aware of the desperation of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose face and neck and arms and legs were still stained with the juice of his disguise , but whose body was as lily white as my own . As day came up over the edge of the sand we stood and roared at one another with uncontrolled mirth . " You 're the picture of shining virtue ! " Ben grinned . " You 're little better , " I chuckled . He sobered suddenly . " We 'll not be so long , once the sun reaches us . What now ? " " Keep going , " I said . " We get nowhere sitting here . " We plodded on , through the cool of the morning . Presentlythe sun came up , first warming then burning us . Ben spoke . " Are you thirsty ? " he asked , croaking the words . " Shut up ! " I replied roughly . He followed me in silence , stumbling now and again . " Tom , " he gasped at length , " we 've got to get out of the sun somehow . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest ? " I demanded harshly . " There 's shadow in the crest of the dunes . " He was right . We found an overhang that faced slightly westward and lay down in the shade of it until the march of the sun brought its rays stabbing at us once more . By then my throat was as dry as the sand we lay upon , and I could feel my lips beginning to puff and crack . Ben 's back was red , and my own was hot and smarting to the touch . " Well ? " said Ben harshly . " What now ? " There was no more shadow . But a thought struck me . " Dig in , " I said . " Bury ourselves until the sun has gone far enough over to offer shade from the other side . " This we did , burrowing into the sand and leaving only ourP333eyes and noses uncovered , which we protected as best we might with our hands . There we lay and baked while the sun slowly marched toward the west . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat felt as if stuffed with cotton . I could bear it no longer , and I squirmed from my sandy cover and stood up , feeling the comparative coolness of the air about me . On the eastward face of the dunes there was a length of shadow that was growing momentarily , and toward this I stumbled , throwing myself full length in it . There Ben joined me , and we lay without speaking until dusk brought respite from the blinding glare of the sun . That night we stumbled onward . Mile after mile , dune after dune , we alternated between sudden chills and burning heat , while our bodies cried out in agony whenever we stopped to let them down upon the sand , for we were covered from head to foot with blisters . Toward morning , when the dune turned gray , Ben flung himself down . " I ca n't go on ! " he croaked . " It 's better to die here ! I wo n't go on ! " For some reason I was furious . I snatched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Get up ! " I snarled , and my voice was a mere harsh breath whistling in my throat . " Get up l Keep moving ! Pat expects me to bring you home . I 'll not disappoint her ! " Almost humbly he struggled to his knees and then rose and tottered on ahead of me , while I staggered behind with fists clenched and anger driving me . That day we had not the sense to take shelter in the sand . Rather we kept struggling on , walking , stumbling , falling , crawling , fighting to rise and stagger on again . Our throats turned to mere pipes of molten sand , it seemed , and I noticed that Ben 's lips were cracked and gaping and his tongue hung out and turned black , and I supposed that my own must be the same , though I could not tell from the feel of it . Several times that day we mistook the shimmer of the heat rising from off the sand for water in the distance , and once we were sure we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find on arriving at the spot where we supposed them to be that there was nothing but sand and more sand . I can not rememberwhen night came , or the next dawn , or how we kept going , or in what direction , though it is apparent that we did move in some way forward . I do not recall the day , save that the heat was there again . I can not remember falling and lying , nor can I recall just when the camels appeared upon the great dune . These things I remember only in brief flashes . Then I seem to recall men clustering about me , men in striped abas , bending down , hands upon me ; the grateful touch of water upon my lips , forcing a trickling way down my throat , and the soothing feel of oil upon my body ; then motion , as of being lifted and carried , a musty smell as of a camel 's hide . And then nothing until I opened my eyes in the night and found myself lying upon a pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , and bearing the wind whispering in the palms overhead . I must have cried out in the darkness , for almost instantly hands were fumbling for me , passing across my body . A woman 's voice whispered : " Fear not ! Fear not ! " I rose up on my elbow , wondering at my stiffness , trying to remember how I might have come where I was . In almost the same instant tinder flared and a light bloomed in the dark , flickering in the gloomy confines of the great tent . I looked about me . A number of figures , wrapped like cocoons in blankets , lay on pallets similar to my own . Close by me I saw Ben , upon another mound of sheepskins , stark naked as when I had last seen him and glistening with oil and apparently asleep or unconscious , for he stirred not , neither did he seem to breathe . Between us squatted an Arab woman whose age I could not determine in that light , though she appeared to be young . Her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes were large and dark . She was clothed in a shapeless garmentof some rough-textured cloth . In one hand she held a flickering rushlight . Her other hand rested upon my chest . " Where am I ? " I whispered . Across the tent one of the cocoonlike figures stirred restlessly , and abruptly she blew out the light , at the same time forcing me gently back upon my bed , while her lips came close and I heard her whisper : " Be still ! Thou art safe here ! " In the darkness I heard a low liquid gurgle and felt warm oil spread across my belly . The hand on my chest moved down-P335ward and was joined by another , and both of them began to rub me , spreading the oil about , up onto my chest and down across my loins , and I felt myself go suddenly hot with embarrassment , for all at once I realized that I , too , was as naked as the day my mother bore me . I felt life stir within me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I smelled the stench of rancid mutton tallow , I was forced to turn my face away . " Where am I ? " I repeated in a low whisper . She answered in a strange accent . " In the tent of Yakoub Ben Ali es Senussi , " she whispered . " He found ye in the desert and fetched ye in to die , giving ye to me if I might save ye . " " Who are you ? " I demanded . " I am Jorah , the concubine , favorite of Yakoub , " she replied , I thought , with more than a hint of pride . " Ye are my slave , by right of gift , as is this other , if I can save him . Who are ye ? " " I am Ibrahim et Tahir , " I told her , " a tabib of Moghreb . This one is my slave . " " Ye lie ! " she whispered . " Ile says ye are Roumis . " I sighed , for it seemed to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said softly . " Ye are mine . I have not owned slaves before ! " " We are Roumis , then , " I admitted wearily , " but lately escaped from the bashaw in Tripoli . " The admission could make little difference now . " What place is this ? " I asked . " Aujila , " she told me . I seemed to remember hearing the name mentioned as a place somewhat south of our route , which we must avoid at all costs . I sighed again . " Rest now ! " she whispered , and her hands again passed over me , I thought , caressing as much as anointing . But I had not the strength to care . When I woke it was morning and I was covered by a thin blanket of wool that scratched my sunburn . The woman was nowhere to be seen , but a tall man in a black-and-white-striped aba stood by my side looking down at me.  | When he saw that I was awake he smiled wolfishly , his yellowteeth gleaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I demanded weakly , although I thought that I could already guess . " I am Yakoub Ben Ali es Senussi , " he replied . " I found ye in the desert . And who are ye ? " I hesitated , of two minds whether to try to continue my masqueradedespite my confession of the previous night . He saved me the trouble , raising one eyebrow knowingly and saying but a single word . " Roumi ! " I sighed . " I am Thomas Tisdall , Tabib Rais of the Amrikani , " I said , " but lately escaped from Tripoli . This other is my assistantBen Price . " " Ye speak the Moslem tongue well for a Roumi . " " I was nigh two years in captivity , " I replied . He nodded as if he understood . " Return me to my people , " I said , " and I will guarantee ye will be well rewarded . " He laughed . " I have other plans for ye ! " he said . " How came ye where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with many halts and pauses , for I was still weaker than I cared to admit , I told him our story . He spat at the mention of Ahmed Ben Khali , but gave no other sign . Instead he rose and stalked from the tent . When he was gone I heard a weak " hist " from the other pallet and rolled my head to see Ben grinning at me . " Who was your friend ? " he whispered . " Be still ! " I warned him , and , turning on my side , cautiouslywhispered to him as much as I knew of our situation . When I was through he grinned weakly . " God surely looks after fools and drunkards ! " " We are not out of this by a long shot , " I warned . " At least we are alive ! " he said . " Aye , " I replied , " and if you want to stay that way , pretend to be weaker than you are . " I did not see Yakoub Ben Ali for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought food , and every night the woman , Jorah , came and anointed us with oil . This I found more than embarrassing , as , though she attended to each of us equally , it was over me that she lingered longest , and there was no doubt as to what was in her mind . Ben seemed amused , and I cursed him . But I was yet too blistered to move , and presently my skin began to fall away in great rents and I itched furiously all over . On the third day Yakoub returned , followed by two blacks bearing between them a bloody blanket , which at his command they flung open at our feet . To my horror I recognized the gory heads of Ahmed Ben Khali and his " cousins , " Hassan and Idris . They rolled crazily across the rug and came to a stop against my couch , gaping up at me slackly with lolling tongues and uprolled eyes . " The two other rogues escaped us , " Yakoub explained apologetically with a shrug . I waved my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not caring to show I was capable of more . " Spare your gratitude , " he growled . " I need none for such as these ! Besides , I am well rewarded . " He slapped his belt soundly , with a knowing leer , and I guessed he had pocketed our gold . " Then all at once he aimed a hearty kick at my side . " Arise , dog , when thy master speaks ! " he roared . The cry that I gave then was unfeigned , for pain stabbed into my vitals and made my head swim . But I retained presence of mind enough to struggle and fall back , and struggle again and ultimately to stand swaying before him . " Stand ! " he began . But at the word I collapsed again upon the couch , making such a realistic fist of it that I rolled off upon the loathsome heads that still lay by the side of it . Withouta word he dealt me another kick and turned and strode out , only pausing at the entrance to order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the jackals . An hour or two later , when it was dark , Jorah came to me and bathed me in fragrant oil of argan , crooning over me the while , with many a sympathetic cluck , so that when she was gone LAn was doubled upon his couch in silent laughter .   " Thy woman , " he chortled , mocking their speech , " will be the death of me ! Hast done thy duty by her ? " " My woman , " I growled in reply , " will be the saving of us both if you , poor fool , will only be silent ! Would God it was you he kicked ! I believe he split my rib ! " We remained two days more in the large tent , each day undergoing a similar brutal testing , and each day letting it be thought that we had not the strength to stand , although our blood was beginning to course again with more force than even Jorah knew . During the day she would come from time to time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing to our comfort , and in the daylight I saw that she was not unhandsomein her wild way . Her body , which she was at little pains to hide from us , was small and well formed , of a dull , rosycopperishtint ; her breasts large and full , but not sagging or disproportioned , her waist small and her stomach flat . Her features were regular in a wild , Arab sort of fashion , with a sharp , straight nose and thin , high-arching eyebrows . Her eyes were large and black , and she was much addicted to the use of kohl in them , which had the effect of making them seem even larger and darker and brighter . Her hands and feet she tinted a sort of burnt-orange color with henna , and her hair she wore bound in long braids , strongly greased with rancid mutton tallow and wrapped tightly around her head . She was a wild creature , apparently caring no more than a snap of her fingers for her master 's commands , for she came and went as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders , and quarreling with him as loudly and brashly as if she were a man and his equal ; a circumstance that appeared to amuse rather than irritate him . With her he had the attitude of a man who has tamed a young wildcat and who knew exactlyhow much leeway to allow in giving her native spitting tendencies play . He would hark to her railing and laugh , and often as not allow her her way . But often he would suddenly grow tired of her venom and would then cuff her , not too gently , arse over end , whereupon she would pick herself up sulkily and go out to mope in another part of the encampment , to return only at mealtime , when she would serve him exactly as if nothing had happened  --  although never , in keepii g with Moslem custom , overstepping herself to the point of touchingP339food in his presence . Unlike the women of the towns , and like all her sisters of the desert , she never wore a veil . On the third day after Yakoub 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remnants of our breakfast , he came striding into the tent and threw a glance of almost venomous amusement at the girl . " Ho , now , little she-cat ! " he greeted her . " ' T is come time to part with thy playthings . " She turned about on him , spitting . " What talk is this ? Hast forgotten thy word ? " He laughed uproariously . " Wouldst take a jest to heart ? " he demanded . " ' T was no jest when thou gave it ! " she retorted He flung up his hands eloquently . " What would ye , woman ? " he demanded . " The caravan is reported on the road from the Fezzan . I must ride , and the others with me , to intercept it ! There will be none here but women and old men . Wouldst have me leave them ? " " What else would ye do with them ? " she asked . " What else ? " he cried , and laughed again , immoderately , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so feeble as not to care what was said one way or the other . " Why , chop off their heads , as I did the other three rogues , and set them on stakes for the birds to pick ! What else ? " " I would have ye keep your pledge to me , " she cried . " Ye promised , and now ye would deny it ! " He gave her an exasperated glare and started to roar . " But --  " " But  --  but  --  but ! " she mocked at him . " Always thou art filled with excuses . Look at them , how weak they are ! What harm can they do ? Set Khalil to guard them while thou art gone ! Surely thou canst trust him ! " " But why ? " he cried . " Why art thou so set upon it ? " She lowered her head and looked about at me . " Because I would have a Roumi slave , and thou promised ! " she retorted . " Especially that one ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " The white one is a Roumi tabib . Would it not be an honor for Jorah to say that she had a Roumi tabib for a slave ? Look how he will be ! When he has flung off the desert fever thine own tabib can geld him then and make him like Khalil , and he will grow sleek and fat . Only he will be white , not black like Khalil , and he will serve me ! The other can be served likewise ! " The idea seemed a new one to Yakoub , and he eyed us almost with surprise for an instant and then broke into a sudden grin , as if the thought pleased him . Almost in wonder he patted the girl on the head . " Aiee ! " he exclaimed . " That is a good thought . Surely they will be more useful alive than dead ! Sometimes , little she-cat , I think thou hast more in thy head than most men ! " She simpered , obviously pleased with his praise , and I felt my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at us . " But they shall be moved to another tent , " he growled , " where Khalil may watch over them . " " So be it ! " she agreed with apparent indifference . An hour or two later we were moved , not gently carried to our new quarters , as you might imagine , but kicked to our feet and driven staggering  --  more than might actually have been necessary , it is true , but nonetheless staggering  --  through the village of black goatskin tents , until , upon the far side , we came to a smaller one that stood a little off to itself . Here we were flung within , with nothing more to cover us than the skins we were born in , while a great blubbery mountain of a black man  --  Khalil  --  was set to guard us at the door . After the men that had brought us were gone we lay for a long time silent . At last it was Ben who spoke . " What do they mean to do with us ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dismal experience . Every step of the way we had been spat upon and befouled with muck and kicked and beaten by the villagers , and I did not wonder that he was frightened , but it did not occur to me , until he asked , that he had not understood what had been said . I began to laugh , for it struck me in a sense as grimly humorous . He cursed me . " God damn you , Tisdall ! " he raged . " What are you laughingat ? What is it they mean to do ? " " Do ? " I gasped . " Why , Ben , I 'm laughing because I never thought of it myself . It took an Arab wench ! " " What are you gabbling about ? " he cried .   " They mean to make an honest man of you , " I told him , " and put a stop to your prowling about in other men 's gardens like an old tomcat ! They 're going to castrate us , Ben . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he gasped . " Aye ! " I assured him . " Would you ever have thought to go to sea for that ? " We were scarcely in a talkative mood ( luring the rest of that day . What may have been the tenor of Ben 's thoughts I can not say , but my own were not such as I cared to discuss with him . Toward evening we became gradually conscious of a growingsound of clamor and hubbub from the direction of the main side of the encampment ; the polyphonous mutter of many peoplegathered together ; the sound of shouts and laughter , the singing chanting of storytellers , now and again a whoop and a shot or the brief thump of tambours , the tuning squeal of a ghaita , with over all the steady rising-falling murmur of many folk talking all at once . At first it was so slight as to be scarcely noticeable , but it swelled and grew louder , until all at once we were conscious of it , and though neither of us spoke , we both wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit to apprehensionlest our capricious captor had again changed his mind . About dusk the music broke out in earnest : booming drums and clashing cymbals , accompanied by the weird squealing of the reed pipes and the wild minor chant of Arab songs . But as far as we could tell , it drew no nearer . Rather it seemed to be centered about the main tent and seemed in the nature of a celebration . Our tent was in complete darkness when a slight figure etched against the dusk of the door and spoke to the guard . Khalil answered , high protest . Then we heard hire heave up his great bulk and lumber slowly away . The figure stooped and lifted a small jug and entered . " Ya , Tabib Sidi ! " she whispered . " Go away ! " I growled . Her laugh had the harsh , unmusical quality of the Moslem woman 's voice , yet it was not cruel or gloating . Rather it conveyed amusement and a certain affection . " Art angry with Jorah ? "  |p342I  did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art not still alive ? " she said . " Alive ! " I growled . " Aye ! Though I prefer death ! " " Then thou art a greater fool than I thought thee ! " " Oh , then , " I demanded bitterly , " is the life thou hastoffered worth living ? " " Pah ! " she snarled angrily . " Thou'rt a stupid Roumi ! What good wouldst thou be to Jorah or any woman gelded and cut like Khalil ? " I was both shocked and startled . " What do ye mean ? " I demanded . " It was thine own thought ! " " Aye ! " she replied . " Had I not had it , thy head would be on a post now , fit bait for vultures ! Nay , Teesdel Tabib , think not hardly of me . Saving is ( lone by steps , and the first was to keep thy head on thy shoulders ! " My heart bounced within me and my breath caught in my throat . Sudden hope fetched me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She put her hand quickly to my lips . " Hush ! " she said softly . " I have sent Khalil for water that ye may wash . He will be back . Canst stand and run ? " " Aye ! " I assured her , starting up . But she pressed me back . " That is as I thought , " she said . " It is well . Tonight I cannottarry , for they make a great feast , and in the morning they will ride . But here is oil to rub thee , and Khalil will fetch water for washing . Tonight I will send thee food , and tomorrow I will make shift to visit thee again . Make the best of these things , for by then I may have found a way . " " Jorah ! " I said . " Why do ye do this ? " " Hush ! " she whispered . " Khalil comes ! " Her ears were sharper than mine . I did not hear him approach , but it was but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim dusk with his bulk . By that time Jorah was standing , as if waiting his return . " That is well , Khalil , " she said harshly in commendation . " Guard these dogs with thy life , for they are mine ! " " Aiee , Lalla ! " he agreed in his high , singsong voice . " Place thy faith in me . " P343She left us , and the mountainous black set down the two water jugs and returned to his post at the door . When he was settled Ben turned his head cautiously in my direction . " What --  " he started to whisper . I placed my hand quickly over his mouth . It was unlikely that the slave understood English , but it was worth while not to take chances . " Here 's water , " I said in my normal voice , " for washing , and oil for our blisters . Can you manage ? " As I spoke I smoothed a spot in the sand where the faint light from the doorway struck it and traced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then glanced at me eagerly . " I can do for myself , " he mumbled , nodding understanding , and adding , for Khalil 's benefit , " God , I 'm sore ! " " Let 's get rid of this filth , " I said . " She told the guard she 'd send food for us later . " We washed then , in silence , each too full of hope to risk talking . Later a bowl of couscous was brought to us and we ate . The feast in the main encampment continued far into the night , and as long as it could be heard our guardian maintainedhis post at the door . When , at length , it began to diminish , however , he came inside and bound us wrist to ankle . Then , wrapping himself in his cloak , he went back outside and lay down across the doorway , falling presently into a snoring sleep , from which he did not waken until morning . Ben and I passed the night in fitful dozing , for our position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hope that I was well satisfied , and I took advantage of our guard 's obvious slumber to whisper to Ben the burden of what she had told me . He lacked my own optimism . " Bah ! " he growled . " She plays with you ! " " That 's as may be , " I retorted . " ' T is that or nothing ! " Toward morning , sometime before dawn , we heard the trample of hoofs and the plopping shuffle of camels ' feet , the clink of accouterments , as the expedition against the Fezzan caravan got under way . A long time afterward , it seemed , the day broke and the sun rose . Khalil awoke and removed our bonds and fetched us the remnants of last night 's couscous . All through the day we waited . It grew stifling in the tent , and though I urged Khalil to raise the sides , permitting the air to flow through , he stoutly refused . Food came , at midday and again in the evening , by whose hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured as on the evening previous , and again the mountainous black took to his bed and slept sonorously . Ben laughed without mirth . " What did I tell you ? " he demanded . By midnight , I confess , my own optimism was fled . I cursed Jorah and all women . I cursed Africa and the Navy and all that had brought me here . I cursed myself for a fool , which was undoubtedly most apt . I struggled with my bonds . But Khalil apparently knew his business , and at length , exhausted , I gave over and lay panting in the sultry darkness . In the doorway the huge Negro snored rhythmically . Beyond , and in the intervals between his sonorous breaths , I could hear the small noises of the oasis , the rustle of the palms in the wind , the chirping of insects , and the occasional scurryingof some animal in the brush . I envied them their freedom . All at once Khalil 's snoring ended in a gasping gurgle . I stiffened . A dark figure momentarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded close at hand . A voice whispered : " Teesdel Tabib ? " " Jorah ? " I ventured . " Art safe , Aziz ? " " I 'm tied , " I replied gruffly . She was beside me then , fumbling . Her knife touched the ropes that bound me , and I sat up and rubbed my arms . " Art ready ? " she asked . " As ready as I will ever be , " I told her . Her hand found my arm in the darkness and , almost caressing , felt down to my hand . I felt the hilt of a knife . " Free him ! " she whispered . " I will return ! " And she was gone . Quickly I turned and felt for Ben . " By God ! " he whispered as I found him . " You were right ! Where is she ? " " Gone for a moment , " I replied . " She 'll be back . " Quickly I cut his bonds that held him . " What now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as mine , " I replied . " For Christ 's sake , " he said , " do n't bungle it ! " " What do you mean ? " I demanded.  | " Do n't be an ass ! " he replied . Jorah returned . We could see her figure darken the door momentarily , and we fell silent . In the dark I could hear her fumbling at something , and then abruptly the tent flap fell and we were plunged in still deeper blackness . There followed an interval of silence , and then the abrupt scratch-scratch of flint upon steel , and an instant later a rushlight flared , flinging the cavelike interior of the tent into flickering , smoky-orange light . In that instant I observed that she wore no more than a single garment of thin gray silk , caught at the waist with a cord of black goat 's hair and fastened with a silver buckle . Her hair was dressed as carefully , if as repugnantly , as for a feast . She stood before us almost triumphantly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I never doubted thee , " I replied . She bent and caught up two bundles . One she opened and passed to Ben  --  an aba of thin wool , striped gray and black , a caftan of green silk , yellow slippers , baggy breeches . " Put them on , " she commanded . He obeyed and stood up before us . " That is good ! " she nodded finally . " Now , go ! " He glanced at me . I translated . " The guard ? " he protested . " Khalil ? " I asked , glancing at her . " Khalil ! " she exclaimed contemptuously . " He will trouble no one  --  ever . Go thou and sit in his place . If any approach , give warning ! " I repeated this order to Ben , who gave me a sardonic lift of the eyebrow and obeyed . Jorah turned to me . " And now , Teesdel Tabib , " she said , drawing the second bundle toward her , " see what I have for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pearl-gray aba , a mulberry caftan and fresh drawers and a shirt , a headdress , such as worn by the Senussi , two pistols , a shot pouch and powder horn , a gold-hilted dagger , and slippers . " For thee , " she whispered , " I have stolen the best ! " I reached for them , but she caught my hand . " Wait ! " she exclaimed . I looked round at her inquiringly . " Let me once more anoint thy hurts . "   For a long instant we gazed at one another , and there was no mistaking the look in her eyes. " torah 1 " I said . " Why do ye do this ? " She unbuckled the clasp at her waist and slipped the silken gown from her shoulders , standing before me naked . " I have called thee beloved , " she said . I rose abruptly . To my astonishment , she reached for the jug of oil and decantedsome in the palms of her hands , running them across my sides , seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thy poor body ! " she cried. " torah ! " I whispered in desperation . " Jorah ! Is this wise ? What if we are discovered ? " It was selfish , I own . She recoiled from me . " Dost think of danger ? " she demanded . " I swear thou'rt no more worth saving than Khalil , with all thy parts ! " I caught her and drew her to me , trying not to smell the rancid sheep 's smell of her hair . The touch of her body against mine was like a fluttering finger , and in spite of me desire swept over mc . " No , no ! " I cried . " Thou dost not understand ! If we are to go , it must be now . There will be time for love later ! " She clung to me . " Teesdel Tabib ! " she whispered . " Aziz  --  beloved ! I have nursed thee and loved thee and brought thee back to health . Is it much that I ask ? Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me down and pressed herself against me . I sought her lips and we strained together , she clinging fiercely in bliss and I with my elbows in the shaggy wool beneath her , for the instant believing that the earth stood still . Her thighs were strong against my flanks , and her nails dug at my shoulders ; her mouth was hot and demanding , and for the instant there was no earth , no heaven , no hell , but only the two of us ! When , presently , we broke apart her fingers sought my brow and passed over it , caressingly . " Ah , Teesdel Tabib , " she sighed , " thou'rt a man ! " For an instant , I own , I pictured her with hair washed and perfumed and dressed in silks ; exotic , commanding . " Jorah ! " I whispered . " We must fly now ! Thou wilt come with me and be my woman ! " P347She laughed , abruptly , almost harshly , and lay back in my arms , her breasts gleaming like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her great eyes . " To the land of the Roumi , Teesdel Tabib ? " she demanded . " What would I do there , alone of my kind , but thirst for freedomas thou dost here ? " " But what of thee , " I cried , " when Yakoub returns ? " " Yakoub ! " she exclaimed , laughing . " Ile is a great fool ! I wind him about my finger I " " Then I will stay ! " I cried recklessly . She laughed again . " And for what ? " she demanded . " To be like Khalil ? " She put out her hand and caressed my brow . " No , Teesdel Tabib ! " she whispered . " This we have had together ! I will remember thee ! Do thou remember me ! " I could have wept in that moment , feeling a dog to know that she was right and that I must leave her . " Come ! " she said gently after a moment . " Come ! Put on thy clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tent presently , stepping over the great prostrate form of Khalil , who , I saw , was quite dead . Ben was sitting a little distance away , among the trees , where he could at once watch the tent and still be unobserved in the darkness . Jorah took my hand and led me along the edge of the oasis , away from the encampment , holding to me with a grip that was eloquent of my own heart 's reluctance at parting . Ben followed us at a little distance , keeping , I thank God , silent for once . After a time we came to a little hollow between the dunes and the palm trees . " Wait here ! " Jorah whispered , and we sat while she disappeared in the darkness . Fortunately Ben said nothing . Nor was I inclined to talk . Presently she returned , leading two horses , saddled and bridled and with full goatskins hanging at the saddlebows . " They are drinkers-of-wind , ' " she said , naming the breed which the Arabs prize most highly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but ye must feed them on camel 's milk , which ye will find in the goatskins , else they will lose their speed . Ye will find what else ye need in the saddlebags , and if ye ride north , thou wilt come to El Maghar in one day 's jour- ney and a half . Beyond that go to Khedir Laguas and Shafa and Kasr Bou Hasan , and thus ye will come finally to Dernc and the sea . " " When will Yakoub return ? " Ben asked abruptly . I translated , and she laughed . " Not for a fortnight at best , " she replied . " By then thou wilt be at Bou Hasan , or Shafa , at worst . He will not follow  --  orwill not find ye , if he does ! " I felt a stirring of conscience and turned over the reins of my mount to Ben , drawing her aside into the thicket . " I am afraid for thee , Jorah , " I whispered . " Come with us . I will fend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length for an instant and laughed . " And have thy women laugh at me and be a stranger among strangers ? " she asked . " All , Teesdel Tabib , thou'rt but a man for all thou'rt blessed and canst not see what sorrow ' t would be for me to share thee ! " " But who talks of sharing ? " I demanded . She hesitated , then evidently stiffened . " No ! " she cried . " No ! Thou'rt like all men , no different ! I would be amongst thy wives and amongst Roumis , and could I be happy but in thee ? " " I have no other wives , " I told her . " More fool thou ! " she replied . " And if thou hast not , then would we both be unhappy , for thy Roumi friends would point the finger of scorn at both of us ! No , Teesdel Aziz , it can not be . We must remember this night , and no other ! " I saw that it was no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my heart that , for all my gratitude and for all my quick fondness , she was right . What , for instance , would Salem say of her , or how would I find her a place aboard one of our vessels ? I kissed her almost belligerently yet lingeringly , and she clung to me . " Remember me , Jorah ! " I whispered , unconscious now of the scent of rancid mutton . " I will remember thee ! " " And I will remember thee , my Teesdel , " she said , " all the days of my life ! " She embraced me swiftly and thrust me away , and a moment later we had mounted and were riding northward toward the sea . Neither Ben nor I spoke , while the hoofs of our mounts padded soft in the sand beneath and the stars hung like bril-P349liants in the sky above . Only when we had turned the oasis and headed well to the north did Ben speak . " Old Tom , " he exclaimed then , " the ladies ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him , and then cursed him as I have cursed no man before or since . He said nothing more , and we rode in silence from that time onward through the rest of the night . THE NAME which the Arabs had given the horses we rode , " drinkers-of-wind , " was no misnomer . They kept up a steady pace , despite the deep sand . Dawn came while we were still among the dunes , but not long afterward we climbed to rocky ground and rode at a steady trot , following a crisscrossed track through rising country much like that we had traversed before passing Bu Njem . Argan trees grew in the hollows , and the ground beneath gave way to flinty desert in which low shrubs and brush struggled for a foothold and cactus and long-spiked hemp , Barbary fig and Dergamuse , or gum euphorbium plant flourished . Ahead of us loomed a region of dark mountains that at a distance appeared green with the first forest we had seen since coming to Africa . At midday we halted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camel 's milk and ate some of the dates that , Torah had furnished for us . This we did in silence , Ben , in some apprehension , glancing always furtively back at the trail we had just ridden ; I with my thoughts upon the girl , feeling somehow like a cheat at having taken so much from her , leaving her nothing in return nor even fetching her with me . Only when we were somewhat rested and refreshed and ready to ride again did either of us speak . " I keep thinking of how they looked rolling out there on the rug , " Ben said . " What ? " I asked , startled , for a moment unable to think what it was he was speaking of . " The heads , " he said . " You know , that 's what they 'll do to us if they catch us . There 'll be no escape next time . " " Aye , " I replied soberly . " We must keep going until we are beyond their reach . " P350 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben Khali . " " True , " I agreed , " though we were able to tell them something of the direction he took . " " They can track us easily enough . " " Aye , " I said , " if they return in time . " " Well , " he said , " I hope their raid is a long one . " " I am more concerned about Jorah , " I said . " What will happen to her ? Yakoub would think nothing of torturing her to force her to tell what became of us . " Ben laughed . " Set your mind at rest ! " he cried . " The wench can look out for herself ! It makes my hair stand on end , the story she 'll have cooked up for him when he returns  --  how we were stronger than we let on ; how we murdered poor Khalil with his own knife and then slipped out and stole what we needed in the dead of night and made our escape ! I 'll wager she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looted his wardrobeand chests and forced her to serve you " Shut up ! " I growled , angered although I knew it was no doubt true . But he did not appear to have heard me . Instead a thought appeared to have struck him . He stared at the horses . " I say ! Have you looked in the saddlebags ? " " Only that one , where I found the dates , " I replied . " She was a thorough wench , " he replied , " who left little to chance . Did she speak to you of money ? " " No , " I said . " I never thought of it . " " Money 's important in this country , " he said . " I 'll warrant our Jorah thought of it if you did not ! " He rose and went to my mount . " Forgive me if I search your saddlebags first , " he said mockingly . " ' T is there she 'd be most like to put it ! " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it make ? If it 's there we 'll find it when we need it . " " Stuff ! " he retorted . " There 's nothing like knowing . Let 's see . Here 's a razor , and  --  I say ! Did n't I tell you she thought of everything ? Here are your knives and your burning irons and such ! Yakoub must have pinched ' em from Ben Khali ! Here 's a  --  little something for you . " He turned and tossed me a glittering something . I caught itP351in mid-air and found it to be a golden chain , fine as a thread almost , to which was attached a little golden hand , a common charm among Moslem women , known as the hand of Fatima , which is supposed to bring its wearer good luck . I recognized it as one that Jorah had worn , and a curious tightness came in my throat , for 1 understood why she had put it there . I was tempted to turn about and ride back for her . " Aha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you ? " I glanced up from the little golden hand and saw that he had turned about and was holding up my money belt . From the way its pockets bulged , there was more in it now than there had been . " All right ! " I growled . " All right ! She thought of everything . Put it back and let 's be on our way . ' Twill be no good to us if we lose our heads ! " By late afternoon we had reached the beginning of the foothills , where the plain broke into rocky gullies , sparsely covered with scrub oaks and acacia and tamarisks and here and there a scrawny species of pine . Here we rested again for a brief periodand then pushed on into the mountains , riding as long as there was light to see the way and then stopping only until the moon rose and cast sufficient light for us to sec where we were going . Sometime after midnight exhaustion overtook us and we were forced to stop in the shelter of a towering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in heavily forestedcountry , rugged and rocky , with deep gullies and winding gorges between ridges thickly covered with pines , Nvitli streams of pure mountain water  --  real water  --  gurgling through their hollows . We pressed on and presently carne into a valley which showed signs of cultivation . " What 's the name of that first place ? " Ben asked . " El Maghar , " I told him . " D'ye think we 're on the right road ? " " It goes north , " I replied . " We can ask yonder shepherd . " I nodded toward a spot some distance ahead where a flockof sheep dotted the hillside , tended by a ragged Arab who wasdrowsing in the morning sunlight with his back against a rock . Apparently he had not yet become conscious of our approach , but as we drew near evidently the sound of our horses ' hoofs upon the rocky path caught his ear and he looked up . In the next instant he had leaped to his feet and was flying up the mountainside away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I called after him . But , though he must have heard , he paid not the slightestheed , but plunged into the brush above and disappeared . " What the devil 's the matter with him ? " Ben demanded . " Damned if I know , " I replied , utterly mystified . " We certainly scared him ! " he said . " He was frightened of something , " I replied , and we both laughed and thought no more of it than that the fellow was a timid hillman who was not used to seeing strangers . We pushed on , and at the next turn opened a broader vista of valley , with a small river flowing through the middle and an expanse of tilled fields about a cluster of huts . " Well ! " cried Ben . " Civilization ! Now we should learn where we are ! " We rode toward the village , and I noticed a group at work in the fields . They did not at first seem to notice us , but presentlyI saw one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke to his fellows , for instantly they all stood erect and looked toward us . In the next moment they , too , had turned tail and were flying for the village . I shouted and gave spur to my mount , Ben following , but they only fled the faster and a moment later disappeared among the huts . At almost the same instant a musket rang out , and I heard the ball whine uncomfortably close . InstinctivelyI reined in my mount , then snatched off the white headdress I wore and waved it in the air in token of peace . Undoubtedly it was foolhardy , and had I had my wits about me I would never have done it . Yet it was all that occurred to me at the moment , and evidently it had the proper effect , for there were no more shots . Presently two men came out of one of the huts with muskets in their hands and stood staring at us , fingering their locks . I waved the headdress again and , with my hands in the air to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben followed my example and rode at my heels . When we came within- speaking distance they moved to raise their muskets , and I halted abruptly . " Hold thy fire ! " I called . " Why do ye shoot ? " P353The two men glanced at one another . We were close enough to see their expression of surprise . " Ye are not Senussi ! " one of them said flatly . It was a statement , not a question . The reason for their hostility struck me . The raiders from the desert were feared and hated here , and we might well be mistaken for them . " We are not Senussi , " I cried , " but captives who have escaped from them ! " " Ye wear the dress and ride their horses , " the man replied suspiciously . " If ye are not Senussi , how come ye by these ? " " We stole them , " I replied , taking a long chance . They glanced at one another again , then spoke quickly over their shoulders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded the bolder of them , " and advance with thy hands in the air . " He made a threatening motion with his musket . We obeyed , and one brought the muzzle of his weapon around to point at my breast , while the other covered Ben . " Speak ! " commanded the man who confronted me . " I have already told ye the weight of our tale . " He shouted something in a tongue that was strange to me , though I later learned it was Berber . Immediately the huts erupted their human contents . A crowd gathered about us , hemmingus in upon all sides . Presently an old man in a white bournousthrust through them and confronted us . I guessed that lie was their cadi , or head magistrate , and in this I was not mistaken . " Who are ye ? " he demanded . I told him our story , saying that I was a pilgrim , a tabib from Moghreb , and that Ben was my assistant ; that we had been peacefully upon our journey when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men of the tribe had gone to intercept another caravan , and that we had seized the opportunity to escape . When I finished there were some who appeared to believe me . The old man appeared thoughtful . " They will follow ye , " he said at length . I shook my head . " It will be some time before they discover our absence , " I replied . " There were none left at Aujila to follow us or carry the news of our escape . "   " Aujila 1 " a dozen throats echoed the name . The old cadi , however , looked sober . " If ye are , as ye say ye are , a tabib , " he said presently , " then ye can cure my wife I " I saw that it was at once a test and a hope . I was cautious . " As to that , " I replied , " I can not say . But if I may see her , it may be that I can help . " He turned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Leave thy companion . " Even had I wished otherwise , it was plain that I had no choice . I followed him with a warning glance at Ben . He led me to a hut in the middle of the village , where I found an old woman lying on a musty pallet , in the clutch of delirium . I examined her but found no symptoms that I recognized . Even if I had , I would not have known how to prescribe for her , since I had no medicaments with me . All that was evident was that she had a raging fever . Presently I settled back upon my heels in thought , and abruptly I remembered that I had seen vast numbers of poppies in bloom in the fields about the village . " Send thou , " I said , " and have thy people gather me poppies , as many as they can gather . " He went to the door and gave the command , at the same time ordering that Ben be brought to this hut and that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway was heaped with blossoms , and I called for a kettle and fire and water , and in these I made an infusion by steeping the blossoms . When this had cooled I gave it to the woman to drink and then ordered that she be covered with as many robes as possible to induce a sweat . After that we sat in silence , watching , while the life of the village stood still and a few of the menfolkkept watch upon the trail we had ridden . Once in the course of the day Ben spoke . " Why are we waiting here ? What do they mean to do with us ? " " The woman is ill , " I replied . " I have treated her . If she recovers , I think we may go on . If she dies , I think you and I may die also . " I did not mention my doubts of the treatment I had suggested . The old man looked at me sharply .   " What is the tongue ye speak ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I replied . He appeared satisfied . No doubt he knew naught of the lands beyond the seas . By nightfall the woman was worse . She raved , and it was necessary to hold her down . By midnight , however , the fever reached its peak and she broke into a soaking sweat . By morning , though she was weak , it was evident that the worst was past . Our host was pitifully grateful . " Allah forgive me that I doubted ye 1 " he cried . " I could not be sure myself , " I told him , " but God is good . Thy woman 's recovery is witness of the truth . " He bowed his head . " Thou speakest wisely , " he said . " I am a poor man , but whatever thou shalt ask , if it is in my power , shall be given thee ! " An idea suddenly occurred to me . " I ask no pay , " I replied , " but only a fair exchange . " " What is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort thy people wear , to replace these Senussi garments , " I replied , " and give us two asses in exchange for the horses we rode ! " His eyes gleamed . " The ' drinkers-of-wind ' ? " he demanded . " But such mounts are not to be found every day 1 " " Aye , " I agreed , " and when we appear on them we are thought to be either Senussi or rich men , the one of which is as dangerous as the other 1 " " Thou sayest true , " he chuckled , " though it looks a onesidedbargain . " " Take them and welcome , " I told him . " I have no wish but to go my way in peace . On these that is not possible . " " I understand thee . " He nodded . " So shall it be ! " We left the village the next morning , having completed the circle of transport available in this part of the world . Once more we were a poor tabib and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , patch-coated donkeys . Though we kept our gold and weapons , they were well hid beneathour shabby exterior , and I will confess that I felt far more comfortable that it was so . We said farewell to our new friends and pushed on to El Maghar , to which they directed us . There we spent the night in a dismal little fondouk , and the following day joined a caravan for Benghazi . By this means we got , in a few more days without further adventures , through Kedir Laguas to Shafa , where we parted with the caravan , which bore away to the west . We turned up into the mountains , following a rugged trail , and came by late afternoon to the northern slope , where the short rivers fall away toward the sea , and there was a blueness to the air once more that told us that the coast could not be far away . Here , in the little village of Kasr Bou Hasan , we found the market place in an uproar , for there had just arrived a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was saying as we joined the crowd , " are as the locusts in the seventh year . With my own eyes I have seen their five thousand foot soldiers , and their horsemen are beyond counting ! " A sigh of pious unbelief rose from the throng of villagers . I wormed my way closer , risking a few hard looks for the sake of hearing better what was afoot . " They are encamped now on the heights above Derne . " I risked an interruption . " Thine indulgence , friend , " I said . " I came late . Who is encamped above Derne ? " He broke off and glanced at me . " The bashaw 's army , " he replied . My heart within me went bucketing to my belly . " Oh , " I said . " Aye , " he continued . " They marched in yesterday in multitudes , as I have explained . " " There has been a battle , then ? " I asked , and at once could have bitten out my tongue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip . " Not yet , " he said , " but there will be one , perhaps tomorrow . A message was sent to Mustapha Bey , calling for surrenderof the city , to which he only replied : My head or thine ! ' " This left me more confused than ever , for I reasoned that if the bashaw 's troops lay outside the city , demanding its sur-P357render , either the city was in rebellion or had previously capitulatedto our people . " The ships of the Roumi hover off the city , " he went on , " but dare not approach too near . " I could make little of this , but I had made one slip of the tongue , and I did not intend to make another . I gave Ben a discreetsignal and withdrew . I led Ben away to where our burros stood , mounted , and rode on . The less we lingered in this vicinity , I reckoned , the better . As we rode I told Ben what I had heard . " What do you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , " I replied , " but as nearly as I can judge , our people have taken Derne and are now bottled up inside by the bashaw 's army . " We rode as late that night as it was possible to see , and stopped then only because the track had become steep and rocky and dangerous . Nevertheless we were up again and on our way before the break of dawn , for the scent of the sea was strong on the wind that swept up the mountainside into our faces , and we knew that we could not have much farther to go . When the day broke it was to find the mountain dropping away at our feet to a distant shelf of level plain , and beyond that , bluer than the sky and more welcome , the sea . I have known times when I thought there was too much water in the world . But at that moment , after all those weeks in the desert , I thought I had never seen anything so beautiful . At the same instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us , looking like toys at that distance , were a schooner and a brig , of a rig such as never was spawned in the Mediterranean . A little to the cast cruised a small sloop . " Is n't that the Argus ? " Ben demanded . ' She has a familiar look , " I agreed . He whooped . " Easy ! " I warned . " Remember , we could see the entire squadron from Tripoli , for all the good it did us . How are we to get off to them if the bashaw 's army is encamped ' twixt them and us ? " He gave me a glance of irritation . " That 's it ! " he sneered . " Always seek an obstacle ! " " We 'd not be here , " I retorted , " if one of us did not . "   " All right ! " he growled . " At least we 're our own masters here . We stand some chance of getting out to the ships . There we had none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why I say let 's take care ! I 've no mind to be fetched back to Tripoli . " He grunted agreement with that , at least , and we began to search the distant line of the shore for the town . It was some time before we managed to find a scattering of roofs and the tip of a single minaret , barely showing above the rim of the escarpment that rose abruptly from the narrow coastal shelf on which the city stands . Neither was it easy to locate the vast camp of the bashaw 's troops , such as our informant had described . But presently , as we continued our way downward , swinging slightly to the left , we began to see a scattering of tents under the side of a low hillock that had hitherto stood between us and the escarpment 's edge . As we moved farther to the west , still more tents came into view , and although it was apparent that the numbers encamped there had been exaggerated , still there was no doubt that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever depressed . Clearly our difficultieswere not yet ended . All at once Ben seized my arm . " Tom ! " he cried . " Look there ! " He pointed toward the town , which , as we approached , had come somewhat more in view , down the rugged vista of the ravine . Now we could see , not only a scattering of roofs , but here and there a few buildings , and at one point , where the notch of the gully cut deep and a tongue of land thrust out into the blue waters of the sea , a fortlike cluster of whitewashed walls and battlements . It was toward this that he drew my attention . " What is it ? " I said blankly . " On the staff ! " he told me impatiently . " Ca n't ye see ? " My eye followed the white ramparts until I found the flagstaffat one corner . Even as I found it a breeze stirred the flag at its head and set it streaming . Against the blue of the sea it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  fifteen red and white bars about a field of blue , studded with fifteen white stars ! " Ben ! " I cried . " Ben ! It 's " " Aye ! " he shouted excitedly . " It is ! It 's our flag ! " P359With that we both slipped from our mounts and began to caper up and down , whooping and laughing and pounding one another on the bank , all enmity between us for the moment forgot . I think I am not an unduly sentimental man , but in that instantthe tears came to my eyes and a lump burned in my throat . I could sec that Ben was affected in much the same way , and I think that we both had a sudden realization then of all that that flag stood for . When I could speak at last I shook Ben to make him listen . " Ben ! " I cried . " You know what it means ? " " Aye ! " he roared back at me . " D'ye take me for a fool ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town ! " " And all we need do now , " I replied excitedly , " is get in to them . " He sobered abruptly . " Aye ! " he said quietly . " Aye ! That 's all . " I caught his meaning before the words were out of his mouth . It was true . Actually we were little better off . If we had correctly interpreted what we had heard at Kasr Bou Hasan , though our people were in the town , the bashaw 's troops were still outside , and we would have to pass their lines . " Well , " he said , " how are we going to do it ? " I thought a moment . " There 's one way , " I said finally . " How 's that ? " he asked . " Are you game to risk it ? " I countered . " Name it ! " he retorted . " I 'll try anything you will . " " Make a dash for it , " I replied , ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the east , above the town . The bashaw 's troops will be concentrated there , for it overlooks the fort as well . We know there is a road along the coast from the west . Suppose we slip around to that side and get on the road , and then ride in toward the town like ordinary innocent travelers ? If they have patrols out , I 'll try to talk our way through . If they recognize us or try to stop us  --  well , you have your pistol and I have mine . We 'll try to shoot our way through and run for it into the town . The main thing is to get as close as we can first . "   Ben looked at me , then turned about and stared hard at his sleepy-looking little burro . He began to laugh . " What 's wrong ? " I demanded tartly , for I thought myself it was not a bad suggestion and by its very brazenness had a fair chance of success . He pointed to his mount . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded . I shrugged . " They 're all we have , and I 'll wager they 'll run like scared rabbits if any shooting starts ! " We mounted and struck across country , making a circuit of the town and trying carefully to avoid being seen from the camp . This was not so easy as it might seem , for although the countryside afforded fair cover , it was rugged and gullied , and often we were forced to take long detours upon the mountain or down toward the plain . There is no path so long , however , that it has no ending , and at length we came down through a last deep-cleft rocky gully and came out upon the coast road , about a league westwardof the town . It was early afternoon by then , and the sun was high and hot , a circumstance for which I was thankful , for the road was deserted . Neither Ben nor I had eaten since beforedawn , but we were scarcely aware of hunger such was our anxiety to reach the town and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed without them , holding that this would give us greater speed if we were forced to run for it . But this I vetoed , for I felt that the panniers , which were by now nearly empty , were but little added burden to our beasts and would help support our account of ourselves , while their absence would of itself give it the lie . Having settled this , we resumed our journey with the languidair of weary travelers upon a long and lonesome road , yet inwardly a-tremble with apprehension . Although the road was quiet and deserted , it seemed to us that it was an ominous quiet , and we were ready to start at the least sudden sound . To our left we could hear the noise of the sea , gently breaking on the rocky shore , and we strained our ears and sat rigid on our mounts in an effort to hear anything that might be accounted the least unusual above its constant minor thunder . We hadP361not gone halfway to the town before I was acutely conscious of a painful cramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the town itself was well within reach , no more than a quarter of a mile distant , before I heard lien , behind me , hiss : " Here it comes ! " I looked up abruptly and saw what he meant . Out of a little gully , to our right , a score of horsemen were riding at a trot . They wore abas and desert headgear , which struck me as strange , but they were heavily armed . Evidently they had seen us and were coming to investigate , for they rode directly toward us . I had not a doubt that they were the bashaw 's men , perhaps recruited along the coast . I called back warily to Ben : " Ride up alongside me , and keep your hand on your pistol , but do n't let them see it . And do n't look so scared ! " He pulled a wry grin . " Speak for yourself ! " he replied . " You ought to have a mirror I " The foremost rider , a lean fellow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost within hailing distance . " You might have your knife handy for a spur , too , " I said quickly . " 1 think we 'll need it . " " I thought of that ten minutes ago , " lien sneered . " Holy there ! Ye on the road ! " the horseman called to us in Arabic . " Hold where ye arc ! " I stared at him , feigning blank stupidity . " Halt ! " he bellowed , rattling his saber ominously . When we did not immediately stop he leaped his mount into the road and barred our way , so that we were forced to a stop . The others came up and clustered around us , not quite jostling us , yet close enough so that we were hemmed in . " Who are ye , " the leader demanded , " and whence come ye ? Why did ye not halt when I commanded ye ? " " Because we thought ye robbers , ya sidi I " I whined . " We are but poor travelers , bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ye ! " " A likely tale ! " he sneered . " Poor travelers , indeed , corninginto the city at this time ! " He nodded to two of his men . " Search them ! " he commanded .   I waited until they had started to dismount . Then I shouted , " Now ! " and whipped out my pistol , at the same time clapping heels to my diminutive mount . The fellow ducked involuntarily . My pistol roared and kicked almost out of my hand . I felt my beast surge forward and at the same instant heard Ben 's pistol bang and saw the man 's horse rear . His forefeet missed my head by no more than a hair as we shot beneath them . Someone made a grab at me , and I turned and flung my pistol in his face , in the next movement whipping out my dagger and giving my animal a jab with the point . The little beast flattened out and skimmed at a frantic gallop over the ground while I clung with all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind me I could hear Ben 's mount laboring . " Keep going ! " I heard Ben shout above the clatter . " We surprised'cm ! Did you hit him ? " " No , damn it ! " I yelled back . " Did you ? " " Not I ! " he bellowed . " These beasts make damned poor shooting platforms ! " We kept our distance for a hundred yards or more , by virtue of surprise , but a jackass is no match for a good horse , and presently they began to draw up on us swiftly , riding furiously , bent low over their saddles . For all that , we were almost within reach of the gates when they overtook us . As if by prearrangement , the first of them swept past Ben , overriding him , and came on for me . As he swept up behind I turned and struck at him wildly with my knife , but he only laughed and ducked easily under my lashing arm and caught a handful of my streaming bournous . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and over my head , so that my arms and shoulders were caught in its folds , and before I could slip myself free I felt myself ignominiously plucked up , like a trussed turkey , and flung over my burro 's head . As I felt myself take to the air I lost my knife and made a frantic grab for the pannier strap , missed , and a second later was plowing the flinty gravel of the roadway with the side of my face . I had a momentary , fleeting vision of what seemed like a regiment of hoofs , felt the ground tremble and heard a crashingas of thunder , and then I tumblesaulted and must have0 63struck my head , for I remember nothing else until I opened my eyes to find myself lying flat upon the ground , surrounded by now dismounted Arabs . " Ah ! " said a voice . " He wakes ! " I screwed my head around and saw the one who had questionedme . His savage black eyes met mine as I looked up , and narrowed almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A considerable sum for a ' poor traveler , ' " he remarked . " Perhaps thou canst explain this to the bashaw . " I felt my stomach sag within me , and such faint hope as I dared permit myself fled . Well , we had tried ! I rolled my head away so that this Arab might not see the helpless , impotent fury and despair in my eyes . He turned to his followers . " Raise him upon his feet , " he commanded . " Bind his arms and place halters about their necks . We 'll fetch them in . " " Where to , ya sidi ? " one of them asked , and he turned upon the man contemptuously . " Eh , to the castle , of course , fool ! Where else ? " he demanded . " They must be brought before the bashaw at once ! " I puzzled an instant at that , even as they were jerking me to my feet and roughly binding me . The castle would be in the town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , how could the bashaw be there ? But I could beat out no possible answer , which was scarcely strange , for my head was spinning sickeninglyfrom my fall , and I was in no condition for clear thought upon anything . As I stood swaying , shoulder to shoulder with Ben , our captors remounted their horses and , seizing the ropes that had been fastened about our necks , set out at a brisk , curvettingcanter , into the town . What followed was one of the most horrible and humiliating experiences of my life , and I think I may say the same for Ben . It is not easy to run for one 's life with a rope about one 's neck and with arms bound tightly behind one 's back , over a stony roadway in bare feet  --  for our yellow slippers had gone flying when we were snatched from our racing mounts , and our feet had no other coverings . Yet this is what we did , for it was a case of run or be dragged ! Our captors apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must force us to stretch our legs like ostriches . They rode without regard for the road over which we must race , and before we had gone halfway  --  something over a mile  --  my feet were cut to ribbons by the sharp flints and pain like that of redhotknife blades seared my legs from angle to groin , and lungs were like to burst . My heart felt smothered by their weight and my throat was like a river of flame . Yet somehow I managed to keep my feet under me and keep them racing , just sufficiently to keep myself from falling , forwardmomentum being furnished by the rope that yanked at my neck . Had we lost our balance and fallen , either to one side or the other , the ensuing jerk upon our necks must certainly have broken them . But such was the fiendish skill of our tormentorsat this bestial game that we did not , for whenever we showed a sign of wavering they would check the speed of their mounts just sufficiently to allow them to catch us up and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurs to their horses ' flanks and be off again . Once within the town , although the ground underfoot was somewhat smoother , the way was more winding and narrow , and we whipped about corners and thundered through narrow alleys , caroming from wall to wall , until our already threadbare clothing was in tatters and our faces , necks , and shoulders were scraped raw . As we flew thus , our captors rode like very devils , paying not the least heed to the crowds of people in the streets , sending them flying , screaming , this way and that before them , while those behind screamed curses after us and flung rocks or offal at our heads . We were more dead than alive when we were fetched to a crashing stop before a building whose facade I remember only vaguely as an area of steps and whitewashed horseshoe arches . Both Ben and I sank , fainting , to the ground . But before we had opportunity to catch our wind we were snatched up again , each between two burly captors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet more than half dragging and leaving a bloody trail where we went . I have a vague recollection of crossinga courtyard and coming to a stand before a flight of stairs , where our chief captor spoke sharply to a pair of white-robed guards , who barred the way . As he talked a dignified Turk in a gray bournous came out of a small antechamber , and our Arab turned to him with a flood of words that I was still too far exhaustedto catch . The Turk gave us an impassive look andp365spoke sharply to the Arab , telling him to wait , then turned away and climbed the stairs . Our captors relaxed imperceptibly , and Ben and I were permitted to sink to the cool tiles of the floor and rest , and gradually I became somewhat more aware of our surroundings . We were in a sort of an arcaded cloister that ran along one side of the courtyard through which we had entered . Across the court was a similar cloister , giving upon the great entrance doors , while at each end were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the court was a tiled fountainin which cool water tinkled tantalizingly . " There were a good many people passing back and forth , coming and going through the great main doors , or diving off into the blackness of the corridors at either end of the court , but these I scarcely saw until one came out of the farthest corridor and started across the courtyard . Even in my half-dazed state I jerked erect at the sight of him . It was not that I recognized him in that fleeting instant , for I was still , myself , half conscious of a need for avoiding recognition , and consequently had been inclined to look away from the curious stares of those who passed by us . But this man was different . Instead of the robes and drapings of the Eastern world he wore the coat and trousers and waistcoat , stock and cravat of civilization . In themselves these would have been sufficient to set him apart , but it was not this alone that fetched me gasping to my knees in trembling excitement . Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore ; for the blue trousers and the red waistcoat , the blue coat with its red facings , its gilt buttons and its epaulet worn upon the right shoulder , the leather stock , and the high polished hat with its bright cockade , all proclaimed him a lieutenant of United States Marines . I gasped and all but rubbed my eyes , and as I did so he turned out of the shadow and into the sunlight that flooded the midcourt , by the fountain . Instantly I recognized the officer who had been in command of marines on board the Adams during our last stay at Gibraltar . Often we had met and toasted one another on shore there . Involuntarily memory put his name in my mouth and I cried out : " O'Bannon ! " My guard stepped forward and dealt me a cuff to the side of the head that sent me sprawling . But my cry had done its work .   The marine stopped , almost in mid-stride , it seemed , and then turned in our direction . " Who called ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who spoke my name ? " I thrust upon the tiled floor to lift myself up . " O'Bannon ! " I gasped . The guard moved again to strike me , but O'Bannon 's voice rang out harsh and hard . " Let be ! " he cried . " Ye bloody devils ! " He moved forward with his hand upraised , and the man drew back defensively . " O'Bannon ! " I gasped again , for I could do no more in mv present state . He stopped abruptly and stared down at me . " Who are ye ? " he said . " Ye know my name ! " " O'Bannon , " I said once more . " Do n't you know me ? " He stared at me as if reaching back in his memory . " I " he said , frowning . " No , I ca n't say I do . " I felt suddenly aware of how I must look . Even before we had been taken he could scarcely have seen in me more than another Turk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the costume of the country . Now , with my face half blood and mangled flesh , where I had plowed the roadway with it , and the other half hidden beneath layers of dust and filth , with my native rags in tatters and my legs and feet all bloody and cut to ribbons , it was small wonder he did not recognize me . " I am Tisdall ! " I said . " We met  --  remember ? At Gibraltar . I was surgeon 's mate of the Philadelphia . " " Good God ! " he exclaimed . He leaned closer , examining me closely . " Good God ! " he repeated . " I know ye now . Yes , by the Lord , I remember ! " He straightened abruptly and turned upon our captor . " What 's the meaning of this , Tayeb ? " he demanded . " What have ye done with these men ? By the Great Jesus , I 've longed for an excuse to get my fingers on your cowardly neck " The Arab who had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet recognizing his fury and being taken aback by it ; not so much that O'Bannon felt it , for itP367was clear that they were old enemies , but that we should be the cause of it . He glanced at us blankly . " How now ? " he demanded of me in Arabic . " What have ye said to this Roumi dog ? " But before we could answer , another voice cut sharply in upon us in English . " What 's this , Mr. O'Bannon ? I lave I not asked you to keep clear of the sheikh ? " I turned my head and saw that another evident American had come up . He was a short man , stocky and rather stout , with a square face and a straight , rather prominent nose and his hair done in the old fashion , caught behind in a small queue tied in a bow of black ribbon . I noticed that he wore his left arm in a black sling . O'Bannon straightened before him , saluting . " I 'm sorry , General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken these two Americans . Ye may see the conditionThe newcomer stared at us . " Americans ? " he said blankly . I struggled to my feet , though the pain when I brought my weight upon them was excruciating . " Aye , sir , " I managed to gasp . " Americans ! Thomas Tisdale , sir , late surgeon 's mate of the Philadelphia , and Benjamin Price , carpenter 's mate , of the same vessel . We escaped from Tripoli , sir , and made our way hence " " Of the Philadelphia ? " he cried in amazement . " I 'll vouch for that , sir , " O'Bannon put in quickly . " Ye see , General , ' I knew the doctor in Gibraltar . " The older man gaped at him . " Do you say so ? " he demanded . " Why , then it must be ! " " Aye , sir ! " O'Bannon nodded . I le turned to us . " Gentlemen , I present ye General Eaton , who 's had command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could in response , while our captors looked on in undisguised amazement . But before I could respondin any other fashion the dignified Turk who had spoken first with the Arab , El Tayeb , reappeared . " He waits , " he said , and then , all at once , caught sight of the general and O'Bannon . " Your pardon , Excellency I " he exclaimed obsequiously . " The Sheikh el Tayeb has fetched in these two prisoners , whom he caught upon the road from Benghazi . Forgive me that I did not notice that you had arrived " He spoke in Arabic , and it was clear that the general understoodhim , for he answered fluently in the same tongue . " But these men are Americans , " he objected , " lately escaped from Tripoli ! " The Turk stared at us . " Amrikani ? " he demanded , and then smiled indulgently . " Ah , but , Excellency , that is impossible ! Your Excellency has only to look at them --  " " I say they are Americans ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I myself have spoken with them ! " The Turk turned to El Tayeb . " What is this ? " he demanded . " Eaton Sidi says these men are Amrikani ! " The sheikh sneered . " Amrikani ! How can that be ? Why , then , did they shoot at us ? Why did they try to escape ? Why did they hide this and pretend to be poor travelers ? " He jerked out my money belt and presented it dramatically . The Turk looked at the general , who stared at me . " You shot at them ? " he asked . " You resisted ? " " We did not know who they might be , " I explained . " They sought to stop us . We have been robbed , beaten , tortured , taken prisoner by Arab tribes and escaped again . We have wandered half across Africa , and come within sight of our flag . Were we to surrender meekly at that point ? " The general looked sympathetic . The Turk stirred uneasily . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . " I 'd forgot . Well , come , you might as well tell it all to him at once , as have it to go over again . I 'll go with you . You too , Mr. O'Bannon . We may need your support . " " With all my heart ! " O'Bannon exclaimed , with a glance at me . " Come , Doctor , ye 've no need to be alarmed . He 's none so bad a one , this bashaw ! " In the name of God , I asked myself , could this be a nightmare ? How could these two be concerned with the bashaw ? O'Bannon saw my hesitancy and , attributing it to weakness , P369sprang to my aid , supporting me with an arm about my waist and drawing my own arm up and across his neck . At the same time he ordered Ben 's guards to do the same for him , so that we were conducted up the stairs and along a tile corridor to a large chamber with a good deal more tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheikh el Tayeb followed behind us , the very picture of disgust and bafflement . Upon entering the chamber we came face to face with a chubby , effeminate-seeming little man , who had about him a vaguely familiar air , although I was certain I had never before clapped eyes upon him . He was dressed in a rich caftan and bournous , and he wore the turban of a hadji . His fat fingers were covered with rings , and his chubby jowls were sparsely adorned with a struggling beard , though I would have guessed his age to be somewhere in his late thirties . He smiled , and looked in owlish surprise at Eaton and O'Bannon . " Ah , General , I had not expected you , " he said in Arabic . " Well , El Tayeb , where are thy prisoners ? " General Eaton cut in abruptly . " These are they , ya sidi , " he said , indicating Ben and myself . " But there has been a grave mistake . They are Americans , escapedfrom Tripoli . " The little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Amrikani ? " he cried . " Impossible 1 " Then , turning to Eaton , he added chidingly : " What joke is this , General ? I ) o ye claim my subjects now as thy people ? " Eaton shook his head , smiling . " I found it impossible to credit myself , Your I lighness , until they were identified to me . I give you my word it is so I " He turned to us . " Doctor  --  er  --  gentlemen ! His Royal I Ugliness , Sidi Hamet Karamauli , bashaw of Tripoli , who was deposed by his brother Yusuf several years ago , and whom we have undertaken to restore to his throne . Your Highness , these are I ) r . Tisdall , late of the Phila " In my amazement I forgot my manners . " Hama ! " I exclaimed . " Sir ! Did you say Hamet Karamauli ? Bashaw ? All at once it came to me what had happened , and all the1 tensions and anxieties , the hopes and fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasizing the ridiculousnessof our final mistake . I began to laugh hysterically , at the same time breaking into tears , so that together my sobs and laughter were mixed in a hysterical gibbering , beyond my power to control . For an instant they all stared at me , aghast and astonished . Then the bashaw 's face screwed up in an insulted snarl . His eyes bulged and his jowls purpled . " He laughs ! He dares to laugh ! At me ! Hamet Karamauli ! Bashaw of Tripoli ! He dares ! He --  " No ! " I sobbed , yet only dimly aware of the havoc I wrought . " No , ya sidi ! Not at you ! At myself ! " I turned to Eaton and fought to control myself . " Tell him ! " I cried . " This was the way of it ! Everyone said bashaw , ' and l thought it was Yusuf ! It was he we heard called bashaw in Tripoli . That is why I laugh ! That was why we shot ! It was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Easy , lad ! " O'Bannon said . " Give us the story ! " Eaton turned to Hamet Bashaw placatingly . " He feared he was to be brought before your brother , Your Highness , " he explained . " He has suffered much . Perhaps , if ye will let him explain -- Hamet scowled at me but waved his hand in assent . I caught my breath shakily and spoke to him directly in Arabic . Eaton 's jaw dropped . " Ye speak their tongue ? " " I could not have escaped otherwise , " I replied , and went on speaking to Harriet Bashaw . I explained how , at Kasr Bou Hasan , we had first heard that the bashaw 's ' army was encamped outside the city and that a battle was expected ; how I had leaped to the conclusion that it was Yusuf 's army that had been meant ; how we had discovered the camp , still above the town , and our flag upon the fort , and what our feelings had been to think we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had endeavored to win through into the town , and how we had been taken and tried to fight for our freedom ; how I had been confused when El Tayeb had brought us into the city instead of to the camp above , and how I had but just now realized the mistake I had made . P371Eaton translated my story for O'Bannon as I spoke , and the marine 's jaw hung slack . As I went along , too , the bashaw began to see the humor of it , and by the time I had finished he was laughing uproariously . I thought it less funny than that myself , for my feet ached and I was bone weary . But I laughed with him politely and sobbed too . ( ) ' Bannon slapped me heartily on the shoulder . " And this , " he demanded , " was after ye 'd crossed the desert , and  --  did ye say  --  been retaken , and what all ? " " By the Lord , yes ! " Eaton exclaimed . " I low did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he stopped me . " Tell it to the bashaw in his own tongue , " he said . " I will translate for O'Bannon . " I started , and as I talked Hamet Bashaw , while listening , silently gestured for cushions to be brought , that we might all sit . I told the story much as I have told it here , leaving out only certain details which could have little interest for my listeners there . When I had finished they exclaimed at length , while I felt myself growing hot and cold by turns , and my head took to whirling in an alarming fashion . I answered their questions as best I could , at times having difficulty concentrating upon them , and asking one or two in my turn . " What has become of Yusuf 's expedition ? " I said . " They left Tripoli two weeks before us . " O'Bannon chuckled . " It seems they were not in the hurry that ye were . They 're yet forty miles west , and have not moved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three hundred . " " And you 've taken Derne ? " I asked stupidly . He nodded proudly . " Aye , yesterday , with the help of the Navy and eight marines ! " I felt the room beginning to go a long way off . It seemed to grow very hot and stifling , and I felt as if I were soaring , upon my cushion , high above them all . " ' T was more " I began , then tried again to say that itwas more than the entire squadron had been able to accomplishbefore Tripoli . " ' T was more "  | " Catch him I " I heard Eaton cry out , and I giggled foolishly , for it seemed impossible that anyone could reach me at the vast distance to which I had floated . Then , gently , I drifted off beyondthem into comfortable oblivion . WHEN I opened my eyes , sometime later , I was laid out upon a couch in a small room with a high , small horseshoe window letting in a spatter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , for even without looking I could tell that my hands and feet and arms and legs and body had been washed , and my face felt clean and fairly comfortable . Ben lay , perhaps ten feet from me , across the narrow room , upon a similar couch , and looking at him , I had some sort of an idea of my own condition , for his wounds had been washed and dressed , comfortingly if crudely , and the dust and filth and stains of travel had been washed away . As I rolled my head I heard a chuckle and glanced down to see O'Bannon lounging in the doorway . " Good morning , " he said . " Morning ? " I cried , surprised . " But ' t was afternoon but a few minutes ago . " He laughed outright at that . " Do ye think so ? " he demanded . " What  --  what happened ? " I asked . He grinned broadly . " Ye fainted , " he replied , " before ye were much more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been asleep since . How d'ye feel ? " I stretched , to test the answer for myself before I gave it , and found myself not much more than one large bruise . " Stiff , " I replied . " Well ye might , " he chuckled , " from what I hear of the way ye were fetched into town ! I 'll tell ye the bashaw lit into El Tayeb for that ! But ye 've no more to worry ye . The general has sent for a boat to carry ye out to the Argus . " " What 's the matter with this ? " I asked . " Have ye come this far to rest in Derne ? " he grinned.  | " There 'll be one of the ships returning to Malta in a day or two , and the general has it in mind the commodore may be interested to hear what ye have to say . " We fell to talking then , and I learned from him something of the expedition from Alexandria . At the outset they had numbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of six marines from the flrgus , Midshipman Peck , the general and his immediate staff , some sixty mixed Greek and Levantine Christians , cannoneers and foot , and all the rest Arabs , including Hamet Bashaw , whom he pictured as a weak individual , blowing now hot , now cold over the undertaking . Their hardships in the desert  --  he said that betwixt Alexandria and Bomba they had not passed one flowing spring of water , a distance of near six hundred miles  --  I could sympathize with ; and their troubles with the Arabs  --  shifty , grasping , capricious as I knew them to be  --  I could well understand . Nevertheless , he told me , by the time they had reached Derne they numbered more than a thousand , through reinforcements gained along the way . It was here that he waxed most bitter and displayed his contempt for the Arab fighting man . Despite their numbers , he swore , they had lain back , leaving the handful of Christians and the few marines to bear the brunt of the attack . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in among the batteries , making it hot for them , " he said . " But there was a time when I thought we 'd had it all for nothing ; when our one piece was disabled and they seemed well lodged behind their mud walls . It would have been , too , but for the general and the way he led our charge I I tell ye , Tom , lie 's got guts ! He rallied the Greeks and Levantines and led ' cm in . We marines managed to get up on the fort and dowse their colors . The ships had made it hot for ' cm there , and when they saw us coming over the edge I suppose the gunners thought there were more of us than there were , for , anyway , they flung down their matches and fled . We found the guns spotted and ready  --  no attempt to spike ' em . So we hauled ' em about and turned ' em on the town , and after that our Arabs came on in and the rest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal more to it than that . To all intents and purposes O'Bannon and seven marines car-P374lied the fort defended by several hundred . But he was too modest to make capital of that . While he was talking a detachment came with litters from the Argus , and he saw us taken up and walked with us through the streets , narrow and hot and smelling and buzzing with flies , to the quay . Before we were embarked he bent over me and tucked my money belt in beside me . " Hamet Bashaw made El Tayeb give it up , " he said with a wink . " I thought ye might want it . There 's more in it than I 'd care to lose ! " It was good to feel the lift and roll of a ship beneath me once again . Although there had been a time when I believed that if I could but get ashore I would never go to sea again , now I found myself only too happy to be leaving . The Argus being a brig , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main cabin , while Ben was sent forward to the diminutive sick bay , which he shared with the wounded members of the expedition . Here , in our respective quarters , we were attended by Larkin Griffin , surgeon of the Argus , who made a great point of displaying our hurts to our new shipmates , as an evidence of Tripoline brutality , and , indeed , succeeded in stirring up so much indignation that I felt embarrassed . We spent two days on board the Argus , when we were transferred to the sloop Hornet , twelve , Lieutenant Evans commanding , which was to be dispatched that afternoon , with word of the victory and requests for supplies , to Malta . The voyage westward which followed , I think , I shall alwaysremember as one of the pleasantest sea journeys of my life . Theweather was fine , as it is apt to be in those parts at this timeof the year . We were a small ship with nothing to do but go where we were bound , and with a much greater sense of comradeshipand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels . We drove as fast as the winds that we met would take us , yet there was no sense of urgency . And best of all , those of us who had come on board at Derne , the wounded , a courier from General Eaton to Commodore Barron , and Ben and myself , to whom such a life of leisure at sea was all but unheard of , had nothing to do and were required to do no duty . We were sixteen days in passing , and byP375the time we came within sight of the narrow gullet , with its washing tides , and the all but perpendicular slopes of Valetta would ever he . We reached the harbor mouth an hour or two before daybreakand cruised offshore , mindful of the regulation which permits no ship to enter between sunrise and sundown . As the dawn came up I found myself in the eyes of the vessel , for , belonging to no watch , 1 might come and go as I pleased , and , to me , at least , there is no sight comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben there before me , and we nodded as we met and recognized one another , but beyond that exchanged no greeting . Gradually the cleft of the gullet opened and cleared and we were able to look down it . There were several British ships , frigates and ships of the line , at anchor in the pool , their black sides and yellow stripes gleaming through the misty dawn , while over on the shadowed side , in the Great Port , lying close against the town , where the mists had not yet risen , lay several other vessels , as nearly as I could make out a brig or two , two ships , a schooner , and a mixture of smaller craft . Yet even before we had turned into the harbor , before I could make out the detailed outline of these vessels , Ben grabbed my arm in a flash of excitement . " Igod ! " he cried . " Look there ! " " What ? Where ? " I said , for I saw nothing unusual . " There ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out ? D'ye not recognize the figurehead  --  say naught the sweep of her lines ? " I looked again , harder , straining my eyes through the morningmist at the ship he indicated and saw a frigate , neat and trim . It was almost a minute  --  a long minute , while he stared at me in unbelief  --  before I recognized her . " Why ! " I cried . " Why , ' t is " " ' T is she ! ' T is the Essex ! " he cried . " The sweetest ship afloat ! They 've fetched her out again ! She 's back in commission ! Look at her , man ! Have ye ever seen anything so lovely ? Have ye ever seen such lines , such sheer ? There 's not a vessel afloat can touch her . I 'd know her anywhere 1 " " You talk as if she were a woman ! " I gibed. if " What woman ever had that beauty ? " he demanded . I thought of Patience . " It strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comparison betweenthings that you ca n't compare . " He rolled his eyes at me significantly and grinned . " ' T was your comparison , " he said , and looked back at the anchored ship . " But I 'm not sure but what you 're right . Have ye ever seen aught to compare with her ? " Our pilot came on board , and we entered the harbor and came to anchor not far from where she lay . The other ships proved to be the Constellation , thirty-eight , Captain Campbell , and the Vixen , twelve , John Smith , Master Commandant commanding . Captain James Barron , in the Essex , proved senior officer present afloat and , as such , flew the pendant , which requiredMr . Evans to report aboard . Since I was in a sense a part of the dispatches , I accompanied him in the jolly boat . Captain Barron received us in the great cabin , and we stood at attention until he gave us " at ease . " We were joined there by Captain Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there Mr. Evans made his report , thrusting me forward as his primary exhibit . Captain Barron questioned me sourly , with the severity of the good-natured man turned by the consciousness of his responsibility , and it may be that I took a liberty in attempting to break through his reserve , for he heard me out with a scowl upon his round face and ordered me to report in the morning , with Ben , for duty aboard the Essex . I suggested that perhaps the commodore would like to hear our stories . But his pink-nosed , blue-jowled face purpled at the thought that I would question his command , and he bawled at me furiously : " What you may think has little weight with me , Sirrah ! I carry my brother 's resignation in favor of Captain Rodgers ' , and ' t is to him I am obliged to carry all my reports ! " " Aye , aye , Captain , " I replied . I did not know that he had advised his brother not to resign and was disgruntled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to know it presently , for it resulted in bad blood between him and Rodgers . " Harrrummmph ! " he grunted . " Well and good ! Well and good ! See you report aboard first thing in the morning , and fetch that carpenter with you . We can use him ! "   " He 's been a prisoner , sir 1 " I ventured to remonstrate . " What difference does that make ? " he demanded . " He 's a carpenter , is n't he ? He 's an American ? Ile signed on the Philadelphia ? His sea time is not up , is it ? Goddammit ! We need a carpenter . Bring him here ! " " Aye , Captain , " I said , and let it stand at that , knowing it useless to do otherwise . To my surprise , when I told him the news Ben was far from reluctant . " We go aboard the Essex ? " he cried . " Now there 's good news ! I had not thought ye such a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " Do n't thank me . ' T was none of my doing , and I doubt you 'll be so pleased with it when you stop and think what it means . " " What does it mean ? " he snorted . " Why , that Captain Barron means to sign you on , " I replied , " and seeing the ship is but new come into these waters , it may be a long cruise . It may delay your return home . " " Home ! " he laughed . " Who wants to go home ? Here 's the Essex just come out , and you prate of going home ! " I looked at him in amazement . I had never heard a foremast hand speak so . Nor , from what I had seen of the life , was there any reason why one should . It was harsh and cruel and exacting , often unjust , and though jack soon develops an affection for this ship or that , he is usually a born growler and always ready for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them but would give his right hand to be free . Yet here was Ben  --  a man , I thought , of some intelligence  --  turning about and flying in the face of all reason . " Well , " I said , " you may not want to go ! Ionic , but I do , and I 'll admit it freely . " " And what 's to stop you ? " he demanded with a mockingglint in his eye . " You 're welcome to the first opportunity ! " I wondered how he could be so callously indifferent . " What of Pat ? " I said . His eyes narrowed angrily . " Look ! " he exclaimed . " Why do n't you go back to Pat ? You 're so solicitous about her ! Why do n't you go back and tell her what kind of a swine I am ? Poison her against me ! Take her away from me ! Why do n't you ? "   " I would , " I said coldly , " hut she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she loves you . She told me so . Even if she did not , she 's an honest , honorable woman who 's made a contract and will stand by it . " He threw back his head and laughed . " Honest , honorable woman ! ' " he quoted me . " Ah-hah-hahah ! That 's good , Tom ! You put it so concisely  --  your foolish little morals ! D' you think I ca n't see through you ? D' you think I do n't know you both ? Honest , honorable are the words  --  synonyms for simple ! So long as I know ye both honest and honorable  --  or even one of ye  --  I have nothing to worry about ! " In that moment I would have happily smashed my fist in his face , but we stood upon the deck of a naval vessel and I would not have even him think that I would take advantage of my rank . I turned upon my heel , but he caught me . " Wait ! " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villain . " " You could n't be as complete a villain as I think you ! " I said stiffly . He chuckled thereby infuriating me the more . He was so completely the master of the situation . It irritated me . " If it were any other ship , " he said , " I give you my word , Tom , I 'd refuse it . But the Essex ! Tom , she 's always been a lucky ship for me . I ca n't help feeling it , my life and hers are someway bound together . " " That 's nonsense ! " I snorted . " Plain superstition ! Besides , if you can feel that way about an inanimate hulk , why ca n't you recognize the greater claim of living flesh ? " " Inanimate hulk ? " he roared indignantly , and for an instant I thought it was he who would strike me . " Can you say that about the Essex ? Why , you  --  you  --  you turd-stinking mud puppy ! If ever a ship lived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Price ! " I cried , shaking with rage now . " Hold on ! If you were an officer , I 'd have you out for that insult . You take advantage of your inferiority in rate to bait me . " " I 'm sorry ! " he sneered petulantly . " Never let it be said I took an unfair advantage of you ! " I left him then , knowing that if I stayed longer I would have murder on my hands . In fact I wondered why I had not seizedP379the thousand-and-one opportunities that had been mine during our escape . He called me fool for my honesty , and I felt now that he was right . This was our declaration of a renewal of hostilities , our notice to one another that the truce was ended and that henceforthwe were to return to our former relationship . We transferred from the Hornet the next day , and , as I suspected , Ben was signed on as carpenter 's mate with no assurance that if another ship left for home before the Essex he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to put in a word to that effect , if the opportunity arrived . For my part I was treated as a passenger . The captain remainedpeevish  --  which is the only word I can find to describe his attitude , for he seemed to resent me . Wit i the other officers I got on well . With my fellow passenger , however , Colonel Lear , our consul to Algiers , who had been empowered to treat with Yusuf Bashaw for peace , and who was en route to Tripoli for that purpose , I was at odds , for we disagreed as to the merits of General Eaton 's expedition , he maintaining that we had no right to interfere in the internal affairs of the country , while I held that we might properly avail ourselves of what means came to hand to win our point . The Essex sailed from Malta on the twenty-fifth of May , coming the following evening before " Tripoli , where we found the Constitution and the President cruising offshore . The sight of the city in which I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which so many of my comrades were still confined , was profoundlymoving to me , even though it was a great satisfaction to view it once more from an American man-of-war . Immediately upon our arrival Captain Barron boarded the Constitution , taking Colonel Lear and myself with him , to deliverthe orders which formally turned over command to CommodoreRodgers . I was amused at the meeting of these two , for if Barron was a martinet , the new commodore was an even more uncompromising disciplinarian . Stern and tight-lipped to the point of disagreeableness , he received us in the great cabin , and , after accepting the dispatch which formally named him commodore  --  and which seemed to make him even more sensibleof his own importance  --  he received the letters which Gen/eral Eaton had sent and heard my account of our captivity and escape . When I was done he eyed me balefully . " You say you left Tripoli on your own impulse , Doctor , " he asked , " without Captain Bainbridge 's consent ? " " Sir , " I replied , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind blew , " there is not an officer there would not have done the same , and with the captain 's blessing . Indeed , it has been planned and tried a number of times . " " Humph ! " he grunted . " Had you been aboard ship ' t would have been called desertion . Under the circumstances , I do n't suppose we can bring charges ; certainly not until we 've had opportunity to learn Captain Bainbridge 's views . Meantime , sir , consider yourself in a state of informal arrest ! " He bent bushy brows upon Captain Barron . " What about the other man , Captain ? " he asked . Oh , I 've put him to work , Commodore , " Barron replied unctuously . " Signed him on . He 'll give us no trouble . " " Good ' Good ! " Rodgers nodded his approval . I found myself seething . " Sir , " I said , " neither Price nor myself had any intention of deserting . We sought only to escape , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of our honorable purpose . As a matter of fact , Price has expressed a wish to remain in the Essex , and I would like to ask the same privilege . " He blinked at me owlishly , obviously taken aback . " Damme ! " he rumbled . He swung round and addressed himself to Barron . " There , Captain ! D'ye see how a man may be mistaken in his first impressions ? Here are two young lads , separated by many degrees of rank , yet shipmates through thick and thin ! There 's the stuff that makes a fighting crew , mark my words ! " He spun back to me and offered his hand in apology . " Forgive me , sirrah ! " he said . " I misjudged you . Of course you may stay aboard the Essex . I shall see to it ! You may for-getthat tarradiddle about arrest ! " " Thank you , Commodore , " I said , I fear without enthusiasm . He did not appear to notice . He turned to Barron . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain ? " " Why , yes , of course , sir ! " Barron replied . " Mr. Dorsey . "   " Well , put him aboard the President , " the commodore ordered . " Put Mr. Tiddle , here , in his place . That 's all right with you , is n't it ? " " Oh yes , certainly , sir ! " Barron said hastily . Rodgers turned back to me , beaming mellowly . " There you are , ' Fiddle , my lad ! " he said . " That 's all ! That 's all ! You may go . " " Thank you , sir , " I said dryly . " I thought , perhaps  --  well , sir , you see , I have a pretty thorough knowledge of the city . I might be able to help if you 've planned any attack . " " Ah , harummph I " he coughed . " Yes , yes , I sec ! A creditable thought , too . ' T is unfortunate you were not here with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . Here 's Mr. Lear come to talk peace . Ah  --  did ye say you 'd been in fairly close contact with the bashaw ? " " I think I may say I 'm fairly acquainted with him , sir , " I replied . " Hah ? " he grunted politely . " And what , say , would you judge was his attitude toward us  --  er  --  that is , when you last saw him , which I understand was several months ago ? " " In March , sir , " I replied . " That is true . These people are very childish , sir , very capricious , and what they swear to today they will pretend ignorance of tomorrow . When I left , sir , the bashaw was very much in fear of an attack by your squadron and enraged at our seeking out his brother in Egypt . Ile was then swearing that if an attack were attempted he would put every prisoner in his hands to the sword . " " There , you see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must rely on Mr. Lear to negotiate a peace and rescue your shipmates . It would hardly do , would it , to have their blood upon our heads ? Certainly not until we had tried every means to release them peaceably ! " " Sir , " I said , " I think you need worry very little on that score . It would be my guess that General Eaton 's success in the east , in taking Derne , combined with the good sense of his minister , Sidi Mohammed D'Ghies , who is nobody 's fool , would prevent him from making any such fatal move . Alive , the prisoners are a weapon in his hand , for through them he may obtain better terms of us . Dead , they no longer have any value to him . I might point out to you too , sir , that because of his persistence in this war , and its consequent heavy taxes , he is now fairly surrounded , on all sides , by a dissident population . This I can testify by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to cross his country unsuspected . " He nodded pontifically . " Interesting ! Interesting ! But all the more reason why we must leave matters to Mr. Lear . I thank you , Tiddle , but I think we 'll have no further need of you . You may go now . I 'll send for you if I want you . " His dismissal was unmistakable and left no room for argument , and I bowed myself out of my only attempt at internationaldiplomacy with more profuse thanks than I felt . As he had half predicted , however , Colonel Lear was able , by bribery and negotiation , to accomplish in a few days byr peaceful means what all our frigates and gunboats had been unable to do in three years . On the third of June the bashaw accepted the terms offered him and signed the treaty bringing peace to our two nations , not to mention freedom to all of my countrymen still held prisoner in his castle . I know there are some who feel that the price , sixty thousand dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribute we had sworn never to pay . But for my own part I say one does not put a price upon men 's suffering . Had we paid a like sum to each man still in captivity for what he had undergone , it would not be too much . However , that was a matter over which I had no control . On the last day of May , Captain Barron assumed command of the frigate President , while Master Commandant George Cox , lately commanding officer of that ship , assumed command of the Essex . So ended , to all intents and purposes , the Mediterranean phase of our adventures , for , although the Essex remained yet a full year in those waters , it was , for me at least , a period of dull routine and waiting . Our comrades in captivity were releasedand fetched aboard the various vessels of the squadron . Lieutenant Porter remained upon the Mediterranean station , first as commanding officer of the Constitution , under the paternal eye of the commodore , and later in command of the Enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other officers of the Philadelphia , however , returned home either in the President , in July , or in the Constellation , whichP383sailed not long afterward . A few of the men were lucky enough to find berths aboard those ships and so went home . But for the most they were distributed through the squadron and required to serve until such time as their particular ship went home . This was done without regard to their condition , which in the main was pitiful , and quite without consideration for the fact that they had been more than a year and a half in captivity and so might be thought to have earned the right to return . It was an injustice which made my blood boil , though I was powerless to do anything about it , other than to see that life was made as easy as possible for those that were assigned to the Essex . In July , Master Commandant Charles Stewart relieved Captain Cox in command of the Essex , and I , for one , was sorry to see the change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also a stern disciplinarian . For two months thereafter , while we cruised off Tunis , the greater part of my duty lay in treating lacerated backs which had felt the discipline of the cat . In August the bey of Tunis signed a treaty of peace . Shortly afterward Captain Hugh Campbell relieved Captain Stewart in the Essex . From then on , through the winter , we cruised back and forth between Gibraltar and the central Mediterranean , for the most part convoying American merchantmen up and down . Li these months almost our only excitement came when we put into Gibraltar or Malta or Syracuse or Port Mahon , all ports in which we could expect to find British vessels and look for a good fight or a duel or some similar unpleasantry , for our British cousins , even then , grew daily more arrogant and condescending toward us , and in plain self-defense we were forced to put the chip upon our shoulder . Early in June , more than a year after our release , it was announced that we would shortly sail for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation , until finally CommodoreRodgers came aboard , hoisting his broad pendant in the Essex , for he was to return with us . The next day we weighed anchor and stood out to sea , dipping our colors punctiliously to the Constitution , the only ship of the squadron remaining in this station . Running westward through the Mediterranean , we were occasionally baffled by contrary winds , but once through the Straits and in the open ocean , we soon picked up the trades and bowled merrily along . On the twenty-second of July , after what must have been close to a record run for a ship of our class , we raised the white beaches and piny flats of the Virginia Capes , and six days later we warped into our berth at the Washington Navy Yard . When we signed our pay accounts and went ashore a few days later , it was for Ben and me and for some of the rest of us the first time in more than three years that we had set foot upon American soil . At that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
