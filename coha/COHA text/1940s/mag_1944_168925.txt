Frances Perkins , first woman Cabinet member in U.S. history , last week made what might be her last speech as Secretary of Labor . Her theme was old ; but , coming from her , it was new . Echoing one of Tom Dewey 's prime campaign arguments , she suggested that the Government 's dozen-odd labor agencies ( NWLB , NLRB , NRLP , FEPC , etc. ) be put back under the Labor Department . <P> After twelve years in her job , Madam Secretary was tired . Presumably , she had sent in her resignation many weeks ago ; it had been gathering dust on Franklin Roosevelt 's desk . For her successor the President was looking for somebody who probably does not exist : a man who will meet the specifications of both A.F. of L. and C.I.O. , and get by Congress to boot . <P> In the light of her imminent retirement , political pundits began to reappraise the career of this small , plumpish woman who , in her unfashionable tricorn hat , has long bustled in &; out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun 's bitterly anti-New Deal Columnist Frank Kent . He wrote : " Far from being the worst Secretary of Labor we have had , good argument can be made that Miss Perkins is the best . " * <P> The only faults Columnist Kent could find with Miss Perkins were that she has : <P> 1 ) pampered labor , particularly the C.I.O. ; <P> 2 ) yessed the President continually ; <P> 3 ) made occasional silly statements . But what Cabinet officer , he asked , is innocent on these counts ? He added : " Unpleasant as it is to say , apparently the basic reason for the long , sustained campaign against her is that she is a woman . " Then looking gloomily ahead , as is his custom , Columnist Kent pinned a final decoration on Cabinet Member Perkins : " We could do a lot worse-and probably will . " <P> The prospects included : trim , smart Anna Rosenberg , labor relations expert for WMC , who would replace Frances Perkins ' unfashionable hats with modish millinery from Manhattan Hatter Sally Victor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. ( " Uncle Dan " ) Tobin ; War Manpower 's Paul McNutt ; ex-Pennsylvania Congressman James McGranery . And there was always able , Lincolnesque John Gilbert Winant , head of the International Labor Office since 1939 and now U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James 's . <P> *Since the office was created in 1913 , Secretary Perkins had only three competitors : the late William B. Wilson , Pennsylvania 's James J. ( " Puddler Jim " ) Davis , the late William N. Doak.
