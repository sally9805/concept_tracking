For the first time since 1937 , the combined Oxford-Cambridge track team was on a mission to the U.S. The purpose : to flex muscles , see the sights , win a few races . Explained one Oxford high-hurdler : " We try to be as casual as possible . With us , track is for relaxation and recreation . " Britain 's easygoing invaders carried informality so far that their only " coach " was a slender , 20-year-old Oxford medical student , Roger Bannister , who was also the squad 's captain and star miler . <P> Well Run . In Princeton last week against a combined Princeton-Cornell team , Britain 's Bannister demonstrated the casual approach . In the mile , he loped along with a nine-foot stride . When he decided to take over , he spurted to the front . In characteristic English fashion he glanced over his shoulder , once almost took a header running too close to the track 's concrete curb-and still won in 4:11.1 . It was the second-fastest mile run on U.S. cinders this year. * <P> Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spiked shoes since the great Sydney Wooderson . Another Oxford lad , Nick Stacey , ran off with the 100-and 220-yd. dashes and Teammate Philip Morgan took the twomile . But in the hurdles and field events , where professional coaching pays off , the coach-less Britons flopped . They lost the meet , 9-4 . <P> Well Taught . The difference was Princeton-Cornell 's battery of two head coaches and two assistant coaches , including Cornell 's venerable ( 85 ) Jack Moakley . His well-tutored pupils won six events . In his 50 years as track coach at Cornell , Jack Moakley had developed more championship track squads than he could remember . But he won even more renown as a competitor who put as much emphasis on sportsmanship as on winning . In 1920 , when he went to Antwerp as coach of the U.S. Olympic team , Jack Moakley had time for all foreign athletes who sought his advice and guidance . When Canada 's star hurdler , Earl Thomson , went lame in practice , Moakley put his trainer to work on the sore spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the championship . <P> Few Americans understood better than silver-haired Jack Moakley what the Oxford-Cambridge team was proving in its U.S. tour : that competition can be fun and that a good athlete does not have to train to razor fineness to make a respectable showing . This week , Bannister &; Co. planned to do better against a combined Harvard-Yale squad , but their day in Cambridge , Mass , would not be spoiled if they did not . <P> <P> - The faster one : Don Gehrmann 's 4:10.1.
