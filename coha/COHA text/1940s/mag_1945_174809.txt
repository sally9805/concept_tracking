Salvadoran Army officers tried to topple El Salvador 's new up- &-coming; Government last week . Into President Salvador Castaneda Castro 's office stalked 100 Army officers . They demanded a governmental shakeup , including Army autonomy . Castaneda promised to consider their demands . That night , he ordered loyal Army units to arrest suspected officers . As one unit moved up on Ilopango airfield , two rebel planes took off . Loyal antiaircraft fire hit the first plane 's gas tank . The plane crashed in flames . The pilot and the gunner were killed . <P> The second plane , piloted by Captain Francisco Ponce , buzzed over San Salvador . At dawn Pilot Ponce dived his Lend-Leased North American attack bomber straight at the National Police Barracks , killed six of the defenders with his ten bombs . Wounded by antiaircraft fire , he managed to fly on to the haven of a Guatemalan airfield . There he claimed that he had dropped his bombs in self-defense . <P> As the revolt petered out , rebels bolted like rabbits for Guatemala and Honduras ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand in the plot ) . Another rumored instigator , El Salvador 's ex-President Osmin Aguirre , who does not like the present Government 's more liberal program and **25;17794;TOOLONG plans , had remained discreetly in the background . <P> Said Castaneda of the rebels : " They mistook my Government 's benevolence for weakness .
