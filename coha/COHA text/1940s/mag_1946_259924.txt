In Chicago 's Union Station , amid the hurrying crowds , Marine veteran Alfred Wiley thrust magazines into the hands of his wife , handed candy bars to his two little sons . As he hoisted them aboard the Burlington 's Advance Flyer , he kissed them all goodbye . At 12:35 p.m. the 13-car train pulled out . <P> In the outer yards , tower men set the switches for the Advance to roll onto the express track . Soon after , the nine-car Exposition Flyer wormed its scheduled way onto the same westward ribbon . The pair of silver streamliners whooshed along the flat Illinois roadbed at 80 m.p.h. , three minutes apart . <P> Just after one o'clock the Advance lurched to a halt . Trainmen suspected a hot box . Diners in the next-to-last car looked idly through the windows at the frame houses of Naperville . From the 13th car , an ordinary Pullman , a flagman raced up the cinders to warn the Exposition on the wide curve behind . <P> " Too Fast . " As the Exposition bore down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleaming yellow block light . <P> " I immediately began applying the air brakes , " he said , " but we were going too fast , I guess . ... I passed a red board . . . still trying to bring her down . . . . Then I saw the stalled train ahead . . . . Then I saw the flagman . . . Crayton , my fireman , said ' Looks like you 're going into her , Bill ' . . . and jumped . " <P> Flattening the rails under the thrust of its screeching brakes , Bill Elaine 's bullet-nosed diesel locomotive ripped through the steel rear Pullman like gutting a catfish and buckled the lighter diner ahead . Said a priest : " I saw bodies . . . decapitated . . . crushed beyond human shape . " The total death toll was 44 . <P> Alfred Wiley was back at work in a diesel locomotive plant when he heard the fearful news . Frantically he borrowed a car , raced 28 miles to Naperville . First he went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were n't there . Then he went to Naperville 's three mortuaries . Nothing at the first or second . At the third he found the bodies of his wife and two children .
