The Dominion 's War Assets Corp. , charged with disposing of war surpluses , offered some 19,000 obsolete steel Army helmets at 49 each . Canadians were uninterested , even when WAC suggested that the helmets would make good flower pots , feeding bowls for pets , bird baths or hens ' nests . It began to look as if the helmets would have to be junked . <P> Then a boy saw some of the helmets in a Vancouver store . He bought one , spread the news around . In two hours , the store 's stock of helmets was gone . WAC saw the light . Last week every one of WAC 's helmets had been peddled-to small fry with a yen for playing Commando . So . had 47,000 dummy wooden rifles , originally designed for training purposes . WAC said it could have sold thousands more .
