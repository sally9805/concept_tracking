txt President Truman 's board of inquiry into the causes of the bituminous coal strike suffered a setback today when John L Lewis ' failed to appear at the opening session and announced he would advise the board on Monday of al study he was making into " the legal questions " involved in the invitation to testify . Lacking the presence of the president of the United Mine Workers , the board heard coal operators and Ezra Van Horn , the employers ' trustee of the Miners ' Welfare Fund . Adjournment of further hearings until 2 P. M. Monday was announced . This means that the board , headed by Judge Sherman Minton of the Seventh United States Circuit Court of Appeals , can not forge ahead as rapidly as it had expected . The board had stated earlier today that it would hold day and night sessions . Hope had been expressed that its report might be in the President 's hands Monday . Such action by the board would have permitted the President to give the Department of Justice the " green light " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been under way to petition the Federal District Court for an injunction against the union officers and strikers based on the Taft-Hartley Act . Delaying Moves Foreseen Mr. Lewis 's move upset the board and the Government 's timetable . Judge Minton , flanked by Dr. George W. Taylor and Mark Ethridge , his associates , told reporters that the board would give Mr. Lewis until 10 A. M. Monday to announce his decision on appearing as a witness . A decision whether to subpoena him if he refuses to appear will then be made . In the meantime Mr. Lewis will decide whether this is to be the time to attack the Taft-Hartley Act head-on . Even if he testifies he is expected to use every legal resource at his command to slow down possible Government action as long as possible . Every day of delay means dwindling coal stockpiles and will deepen the national industrial crisis . Secretary of the Interior J. A. Krug said today that the executive branch of the government had absolutely no authority to direct allocation or distribution of the comparatively small amount of coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and municipal officials asking for aid and advice , the Secretary said that in the absence of authority he was appealing to those companies still producing coal to give top priority to orders from customers whose services were essential to national health and welfare . Phone Calls Unavailing When the coal inquiry board opened its hearings today at the Department of Labor kleig lights had been set up by the newsreels in anticipation of Mr. Lewis ' appearance . Two telephonic efforts had been made by the board to reach him , without success . Finally the board sent him a telegram which evoked a reply stating that the message had been delivered at 2:20 P. M. Mr. Lewis said that union officials " can not now respond " to the invitation because of a " definitive " study of the " legal questions involved , " but would answer the board Monday . Mr. Van Horn , operators ' spokesman on the coal welfare fund , told the board that his dispute with Mr. Lewis , miners ' trustee , was based solely on their inability to agree on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis , he said , had asked approval of a proposal that all union miners reaching the age of sixty or more , with twenty years of service in the industry , receive a pension of $100 a month . According to the witness , the welfare fund will amount to $59 , - 000,000 by June 30 when the present contract expires . It is made up of contributions by the opera // tors of 10 cents for each ton of coal mined . Mr. Van Horn declared that he had insisted that only miners employed by the signatories of the contract be eligible . Mr. Lewis had demurred to this , he said . At the same time , continued Mr. Van Horn , Mr. Lewis had balked an attempt to conclude an agreement on the name of a third or neutral trustee to replace Thomas E. Murray who had resigned . Letter from Fairless is read Later , Harry Moses , head of the United States Steel Corporation 's " Captive " mines , read into the record a sharp letter from Benjamin Fairless , president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and George Humphrey of the M. A. Hanna Company confer with the union chief to straighten out the pension dispute . Mr. Fairless who had , with Mr. Humphrey , taken part in negotiating the coal contract last July , wrote Mr. Lewis that when the agreement was made the operators had pointed out to Mr. Lewis " that the sound and sensible way of establishing the welfare and retirement fund was to agree upon ' the detailed basis of benefits by negotiation at the time and as part of establishing the fund . " " The Taft-Hartley Act makes provision for this , " the Fairless letter stated . " It is also my understanding that only your insistence caused the adoption of the procedure of delegating authority to the trustees to determine the detailed basis of benefits . " Although the contract sets forth how a third trustee should be named , Mr. Fairless said he recognized that Mr. Lewis would no longer carry out this provision . Therefore , he suggested that Mr. Lewis confer in a collective bargaining conference with the operators to settle the dispute inasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " unacceptable " the Lewis proposal that he ( Mr. Fairless ) and Mr. Humphrey attempt to resolve the dispute because neither of them , he said , represented the entire industry . Also , since he was not a trustee of the fund , said Mr. Fairless , he could not properly engage in such negotiations . Charles O'Neil testified for the coal operators that they had no dispute with Mr. Lewis . He charged that the miners had gone on strike in violation of their agreement because of a dispute among the trustees . Joseph E. Moody , president of the Southern Coal Producers Association , in a letter to Holcombe Parks , vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers , declared that the " illegal and unwarranted coal strike " was caused by Mr. Lewis ' desire to have " free and unfettered control of the welfare fund . " The stoppage , he added , was due partly to the failure of the Government to outlaw industry-wide bargaining and to bring labor , like industry , under the anti-trust laws .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
