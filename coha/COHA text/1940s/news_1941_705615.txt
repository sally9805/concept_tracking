txt Great Britain extended its blockade to French-ruled Syria and Lebanon today , declaring them " enemy-occupied territory " and potential springboards for Germany 's war machine to strike at Palestine , Cyprus , and Egypt . Germany was already apparently using its newly acquired base on Crete from which to deliver a heavy air assault on the main British Mediterranean fleet base at Alexandria , causing an officially estimated 100 fatalities . Powerful squadrons of the British fleet were reported massing off the Syrian coast , while Turkish Foreign Minister Sukru Saracoglu was reported to have informed German Ambassador Franz von Papen of Turkey 's concern over the asserted debarkation of German troops in Syria . The Turkish radio reported that 15,000 German troops had already slipped into Syria , many of them disguised as wounded home from the wars . In Australia , members of the War Advisory Council were understood to have stressed at a meeting today the necessity of adequate air protection for Australian and other forces operating in the Near East . Harry Beasley , Labor Member of the Council . served notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British guarantee of adequate air support . It was announced yesterday that of 6,486 Australians on Crete , 3,599 were unaccounted for , many of them being prisoners . By Mallory Browne Stull Correspondent of The Christian Sciencc Monitor LONDON , June ** attitude of the British public toward the war and particularly toward the crucial importance of American aid if the war is to be won , is entering a new phase . The opinion is increasingly expressed here that the time has come to speak out frankly on the full gravity of the present war situation . Reduced to the barest essentials , the position is that Britain 's need for naval aid from America  --  meaning by this unlimited assistance from the United States fleet , both in the Atlantic and the Pacific  --  is now little snort of desperate . It is not believed that such a message , amounting in fact , if not in form , to an SOS from London to Washington , was actually brought to President Roosevelt from Prime Minister Winston Churchill by Ambassador John G. Winant . But it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are convinced that if an SOS was not sent it should have been . Difficult Situation For obvious reasons , it is extremely difficult to discuss this critical aspect of Britain 's war outlook . In the first place , specific details can not be given In the second place , it P. hard to depict the urgency of the present without giving an exaggerated and mi-taken impre , : sinn of the general situation .

Britain 's detei urination to fight on to final victory remains entirely unshaken by the defeats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this island and of the Empire remains undaunted . But at the same time it is undeniably true that a different view of the war is beginning to be taken in Britain and , to a certain extent , in the Dominions . Briefly summarized , this view is as follows : " Successive setbacks which the Nazis have inflicted on the British and Empire Forces , first on the continent of Europe and now in the Eastern Mediterranean , means that it is no longer possible to avoid the conclusion that Britain can not hope to win the war alone , " No only American moral And economic support , but actual participation of the United States will be required if the dictators are to be defeated . Furthermore , it is even open to question whether American aid will be enough unless it comes in time . " Redressing the Balance For the first time , therefore , a certain section at least of opinion in Britain is gravely concerned over the ultimate outcome of the war unless American participation comes quickly enough and strongly enough to redress the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Near East . In part , of course , this is a not unexpected reaction to the loss of Crete . The full significance of the conquest of this island by Nazi airborne troops is slowly being brought home to the British public . It is beginning to be realized that the defeat of the Empire forces there , despite the assistance of a powerful British fleet , is of far-reaching import . It is important not only because it constitutes the first major success of air-borne troops ; nor because it throws a disconcerting sidelight on the adequacy of British defense preparations in Crete . The loss of Crete is today being assessed in some circles here , whose judgment frequently has been proved right in the past , as an indication that Britain 's position in the Eastern Mediterranean will soon be extremely difficult to maintain to say the least . There is reason to believe that Germany is bringing E-boats and submarines into the Eastern Mediterranean both through the Aegean Sea and the Dardanelles in increasing numbers . That would indicate that the position of the fleet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air but on and under the seas as well . Public Opinion Shaken These views may prove unduly pessimistic and they are not held by the public as a whole . Nevertheless , it is an undeniable fact that public opinion both in Britain and in the Empire , particularly in Australia and New Zealand , has been sharply shaken by events in Greece znd Crete . It is also true that the attitude of Vichy French in co-operating with the Nazis constitutes a heavy blow to the British . It not only raises the gravest immediate problems in Syria but also causes serious concern over the effects on the Battle of the Atlantic of the Nazis ' getting hold of naval and air bases at Casablanca and Dakar , from where they would be able to threaten British shipping around the Cape . Indirectly linked with these setbacks and preoccupations is the wave of disappointment that has followed President Roosevelt 's speech . Ori the morning after President Roosevelt 's stirring declarations most , British people  --  like most Americans , to judge from the press reports  --  felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They felt that the long period of preliminary preparations was over , and they said , " Now there will be no more mere words , but decisive acts . " Thus , when next day reports came that President Roosevelt , after all he had said that seemed to imply immediate direct and decisive action , did not intend to seek the repeal of the Neutrality Act or send American ships into lwar zones or use the Navy for convoys or send American naval forces to Dakar or other strategic points most immediately threatened , there was undeniably a certain reaction here . Significant of this sense of disappointment lies partly at least in the public 's instinctive recognition that the war situation is now approaching a point where even a brief delay might prove to be of the utmost seriousness . It is the considered view of this writer , based on carefully gathered and sifted impressions , that British morale would receive an invaluable strengthening at this time by American action of the decisive sort that indicated that the United States Government was not going to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Britain in the defense of the democratic way of life against Nazi total aggression .
