In severe cases of gangrene resulting from frostbite , there is only one proven remedy : amputation . But the Army last week announced a less drastic remedy that looks promising . Its name : heparin , a well-known anti-blood-clotting substance . Heparin apparently stops gangrene by helping circulation in frozen limbs . <P> Drs . Kurt Lange and David Weiner of the New York Medical College got the idea while studying blood circulation by means of fluorescein , a tracer dye which , injected into the blood , flows freely with it and glows yellow-green under long-wave ultraviolet light . When they froze rabbit tissues ( and later that of human volunteers ) they found that after a time the whole frozen area glowed brightly , indicating blood concentration . <P> With the assistance of Major Nathan B. Friedman , an Army doctor , they proved that the blood capillaries in frozen areas open their pores and pour plasma profusely into the surrounding tissues . The red blood cells , left behind , stick together to form clots and block circulation . <P> Lange and Weiner thereupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( within 48 hours after exposure ) no gangrene developed . Now they are testing heparin against trench foot , which seems to have about the same effect on red blood cells as frostbite.
