txt Testifying in direct contradiction of the statement by Alger Hiss that he had never seen Whittaker Chambers after Jan. 1 , 1937 , Mrs. Chambers said yesterday that she and her husband had been invited to a New Year 's Eve party in the Hiss home in Washington on Dec. 31 , 1937 . The plain-looking , simply dressed woman who was trained as a painter and now works a Maryland farm corroborated her husband 's testimony as the Hiss per- jury trial ended its second week in Federal Court . Mr. Chambers , ex-Communist courier for a pre-war spy ring , took seven of the nine court days to put in the bulk of the Government 's case against Mr. Hiss . The two counts of perjury against the defendant specify that he lied when he told a grand jury that he had never given State Department documents to Mr. Chambers and had never seen the man after Jan. 1 , 1937. 27th Prosecution Witness Mrs. Chambers , the twenty-seventh Government witness , appeared in court wearing a plain brimmed hat of black felt , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her rather plain face was devoid of make-up . She wore spectacles over her small eyes and frequently pursed her thin lips before answering a question . Her work-roughened hands flexed often as she used them to explain a point . Under direct examination by Thomas F. Murphy , Assistant United States Attorney , the 49-year-old witness testified that she had seen both Mr. Hiss and his Wife Priscilla " on many occasions . " After identifying both in their front-row courtroom seats , she was asked whether she and Mrs. Hiss were friends . " Indeed , we were , " she replied in a strong tone . Sharing her husband 's gift for detailed testimony , Mrs. Chambers recalled the pattern of the plumcolored dining-room wallpaper in one Hiss home ; remembered that a chintz bedspread had been bought by Mrs. Hiss at a sale ; described window drapes as " purple " and listed the furniture on each of three floors . Recalls New Year Party Her testimony on the date when she last saw the Hisses was confused by her first statement that the New Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , had been held on Dec. 31 , 1936 . After Mr. Murphy had picked up records showing that the Hisses had moved there in late December , 1937 , she said she wanted to change her testimony . Admitting that she was " not very good on dates , " she then said : " The New Year 's Eve party was on Dec. 31 , 1937 . " Mrs. Chambers said she also saw the Hisses at a wedding anniversary celebration in December , 1937 , to which Mr. and Mrs. Hiss brought a bottle of champagne . " You 're not permitted to tell us about drinking , " Mr. Murphy cautioned as the witness seemed about to recount how her husband became ill after drinking the champagne . " Mrs. Hiss called her husband ' ' Hilly , ' and he called her ' Press , ' " she testified . " They called me ' Lisa ' and called my husband ' Carl . ' We never had a last name . " " What was your last name ? " inquired Judge Samuel H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witness so that he could hear her better . " We never had a last name , " she said . " I do n't understand your answer , " Judge Kaufman challenged . " Your husband testified that you were known as ' Crosley . ' " As cries of " Oh , no " came from the spectators , the witness replied that she and her husband were known to the Hisses only as Carl and Lisa . She had not mentioned the name Crosley . When Mr. Chambers was asked earlier whether he had ever used that name , he said he did not recall using it , but that he might have done so . " We lived under the name of Lloyd Cantwell at Eutaw Place in Baltimore , " Mrs. Chambers continued . " My husband also used the name of Dwyer ' and Breen . ' Then we were known under our own name , Chambers , with varying initials . " " Was New Year 's , January of 1938 , the last time you saW Mr. and Mrs. Chambers ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the witness corrected . " Yes , I believe so . " " You have no recollection of ever having seen them since the first of January , 1938 ? " " That is right , except when this trial started . I have n't seen them since , until this morning . " Judge Confines Her Answers ? Lloyd Paul Stryker , trial counsel for Mr. Hiss , had barely begun his I cross-examination when the adjournment was taken . His questions provoked more detail than he wanted to bring out , and he used a series of motions to strike out Mrs. Chambers ' answers . Judge Kaufman instructed her to confine her answers to the questions after she had volunteered information and opinions . Asked by Mr. Stryker if her husband was " an underground Communist " and " a criminal conspirator " in October , 1937 , Mrs. Chambers replied patiently : " I 'm not very good on dates . If it was during the period when he was in the underground , it was during the period when he was in the underground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband had " ceased ' his criminal activity ! she said she , could not recall the exact date of his break with the Communist party . " It did n't all occur on a special date , at a special time or a special hour , " she explained . " It was a long time in coming . The particular moment of the breaking is unimportant in my life . I believe he broke from the Communist party ' while we were living on Mount Royal Terrace in Baltimore . " Mrs. Chambers testified that she was born Esther Shemitz in New York City in 1900 and that she married Mr. Chambers , " my first and only marriage , " on April 15 , 1931 . She said they had two children , a girl 15 and a boy of 12 . After going to school in New Haven , she said , she studied at the Rand School here on a scholarship . Later , she said , she studied painting at . the National Academy of Design , the Art Students League and the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given one , and possibly two , of her paintings to Mrs. Hiss . Her jobs included one as advertising manager of New Masses and a clerical job with Amtorg Trading Corporation , a , Soviet agency . Tells of Life on Farm " I milk eighteen cows and take care of forty head of cattle , and six beef cattle , plus the children , on my husband 's farm in Westminster , Md. , " she said . " We 've been on the farm for ten years now . " " Did you know Mr. Chambers was a Communist ? " Mr. Murphy asked . " Yes , indeed , " the witness replied . " Are you a Communist ? " asked the Government prosecutor . " I have been sympathetic to communism , " she answered , " but I have never been a member of the Communist party . " Beginning with her first meeting with the Hisses in the Chambers apartment in Baltimore in April or May , 1934 , Mrs ... Chambers said she and her husband met the Hisses frequently during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anniversaries together , she said , they had made excursion trips with the children and had visited each other back and forth on numerous occasions . Mr. Stryker will continue his cross-examination of Mrs. Chambers when the trial goes into its third week on Monday morning . Her testimony yesterday was supplemented by several minor witnesses for the prosecution .
