LITERATURE as a business is prospering as never before , with book after book selling more than a quarter of a million copies , but literature as an art is in a dead season . Looking at the bookshelves from week to week , the critic sees little to encourage him . He sees correspondents ' stories cabled home from North Africa or New Guinea , although they might as well have been mailed by slow boat and sunk in mid-ocean , the supply of manuscripts being inexhaustible and the chapters interchangeable . He sees inspirational books ghost-written for heroes who found God in a foxhole and a contract waiting in Hollywood . He sees discussions of the peace based on the notion that the world has n't really changed since 1914 . He sees cute memoirs by feature writers and news photographers who met such interesting people . He sees women 's magazine serials dealing with the great problem of divorce and how to prevent it ? why , the war is the answer , with trumpet calls , Old Glory and so to bed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forget that they came from very distinguished families . He sees historical novels that might have been written in collaboration by Miss Ginger Rogers and Parson Weems . He sees book after book manufactured on the assembly line ? the 1943 models , reconditioned and stripped of chromium , but with the old dependable motors inside . It is not their presence that depresses him so much as the absence of other books he had hoped to find . Where are the novels about America in emotional con ? fusion and Europe under the terror ? Where are the true pictures of refugees in Marseilles waiting for the ship sirens that never sound , or of harassed officials in Washington , or of airplane plants in Southern Califor ? nia ( the Joads are working there now ) , or of cor ? porations everywhere waving the flag while they scramble for still higher profits and lower taxes ? Where are the correspondents ' books on a level with the best of those written during the 1930 's ? Where are the political treatises by authors who recognize that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn for a discussion of our real problems at home ? And , to ask an older question , where are the war poets ? ? not the battle poets or the patriotic rhymesters , but soldiers writing honest verse about what they see and feel . The need and the public appetite for books are present as never before in our lives , but the authors seem to be stricken with inertia in the face of changes too swift and events too sudden , vast and complicated for them to handle . I This is the first of a series of articles on American civilization in wartime . The second will be " Architecture in Wartime , " by Percival and Paul Goodman . ? THE EDITORS Of course we know that many people find it im ? possible to write books in wartime . Most of the younger authors are living in a G. I. world where they have little time for literature . Many of the middle-aged authors are in uniform too , perhaps serving as war correspond ? ents or , as intelligence officers with air squadrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired to write . American authors in general are more deeply involved in the war than they were in 1918 ; this time the radicals are even more patriotic than the conserva ? tives . There are , however , enough able writers still in civilian life ? women , 4F 's and over-thirty-eights ? to produce better books than most of those we have been reading since 1941 . Seeking other reasons for the low level of American literature in wartime , we may find that some of them are connected with defeats that were suffered long before Pearl Harbor . I do n't propose to review the literary history of the last twenty-five years . Time and again the critics have discussed some of its chief features , including the re ? action against social literature after the First World War and the reaction against personal and formalistic writing that occurred during the 1930 's . Sometimes it seems that the record of the inter-war period was that of a swinging pendulum or an alternation between two poles : between the public and the private , the ob ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphic and the fantastic or abstract . Sometimes the same individuals moved in both directions at different times : for example , Archibald MacLeish 's first book was a collection of poems called " The Tower of Ivory , " a title that might have been applied to almost all his work during the first decade after Versailles . Even future writers on international politics were concerned at the time with a realm of fantasies : John Gunther published an artificial romance called " The Red Pa ? vilion " and Vincent Sheean contributed to the little magazines . In the 1930 's , on the other hand , both Sherwood Anderson and Waldo Frank wrote strike novels , using the same technique they had developed for treating subjective themes . By that time subjec ? tivity was out of fashion . The private world was almost deserted for the world of factories , breadlines and inter ? national revolutions . When we look at the period in retrospect , it seems that the social movement among writers reached its highest point in 1937 . That was the year of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also the crucial year of the war in Spain . American writers had been devoting more and more attention to what hap ? pened in Europe , and now there was no question of where their sympathies lay . Hundreds of them joined the League of . American ' Writers , which was actively campaigning for the Loyalists . The League published a paniphlet called " Writers Take Sides , " of which I have lost my copy ; nevertheless I can remember the contents . Out of something like 418 ' writers who had answered a questionnaire , there was only one who favored Franco ( it was Gertrude Atherton ) . Perhaps a score of the others were cautious or undecided , but all the rest enthusiastically supported the Spanish Repub ? lic . Many young American writers served in the Abraham Lincoln Battalion , while older ones visited Spain as correspondents and came home to do propa ? ganda work . There were hundreds of writers who organized Loyalist meetings , signed petitions to the President and raised funds for medical relief . They wrote poems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most American or English poets have shown when treating the war against Germany and Japan . In a sense , the conflict in Spain was their war , and the defeat of the Spanish Republic was their defeat . Spain was also the subject of the novel that Ernest Hemingway published at the end of 1940 . " For Whom the Bell Tolls , " besides being the best and almost the only good war novel of the last ten years , has so far been the last major work produced by any member of his generation . This remark is not intended as a prophecy , since I feel that some , of these writers have still to do their best work , but for three years most of them have fallen into a curious half-silence . There are a few exceptions : Faulkner and Wilson have done some of their best writing , but in shorter pieces . Dos Passos has been working on a biography of Jefferson and has meanwhile published two short novels , the first of which was so bitterly disillusioned that it must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to read . Among those a few years younger than the postwar generation , Farrell has taken a long step down from Studs Lonigan to Danny O'Neill , and Steinbeck has taken a still longer step from " The Grapes of Wrath " to " The Moon Is Down . " It may be that I am neglecting still younger writers , and yet I feel that literary history will not have much to say about the last three years . This does not mean that I am trying to establish a causal relationship between the Spanish civil war and the present state of American letters ; what happened was much more complicated . The fall of the Spanish Republic came midway in a whole series of disasters , a litany we haVe learned by heart : the Moscow trials , the invasion of Austria , the surrender at Munich , the seizure of Prague and the Russo-German Pact . This last , among other things , was Stalin 's declaration to the world that he had lost faith in the power of the West ? ern liberals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were his friends . Ex ? ternal defeats lead to internal dissensions , and the literatary world in New York was no exception to this rule ; it was divided by as many quarrels as a colony of exiles . Then came the fall of France , which was the deepest of all the emotional shocks to those Americans who had lived there in the postwar decade and had learned to regard France as a second fatherland . I can remember a friend of mine , an aviator in the other war , standing at attention with the tears streaming down his cheeks when somebody put a new record on the phonograph and it turned out to be the " Marseillaise . " Then , too , there were professional reasons for dis ? couragement . The social realism of the 1930 's had proved to be a less fertile movement than many writers had hoped . It had produced one novel that grows in stature with the years ? I mean Dos Passos ' " U. S. A. " ? and another novel , " The Grapes of Wrath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retains the power of a popular myth . It had produced a quantity of good reporting and a few effective dramas , chiefly the early plays of Clifford Odets , but it had also produced many plays and novels that followed the same threadbare pattern of conversion . Considering that it claimed to speak for the popular heart , the movement was strangely argumentative and prosaic . There was the verse of the Social Symbolists , who wrote about the Scottsboro trial in such strained metaphors that they might as well have been using medieval Latin , but there were almost no folk poets . People had begun to feel the need of books with more warmth , inwardness and freedom . The point I am trying to make depends on a whole series of , events , literary and political , but the Spanish war might stand as a symbol for all of them . One effect it had on writers was to separate them from the public at large , which had been less interested in Spain and was now less disturbed by the victory of the fascists there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to their audience and had gained strength from this relationship , but now they were farther apart than ever . A more serious effect of the war on those whose sympathies had been deeply en ? gaged was that it produced a postwar mood of disil ? lusionment or even despair , and this in the midst of a prewar situation . Like the public itself , if for different reasons , American writers were emotionally confused and unprepared for the events that would soon follow . The younger writers , those now in the army , were in some ways even more unprepared for what would happen than were those already established in their profession . Two years ago I talked with several of them at length , when I taught for a week in a writers ' school on a hilltop in the Berkshires . The students in my class were between nineteen and twenty-five years old , all of them likable in their different ways and some quite tal ? ented . They may have learned something from me ; there is no doubt whatever that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that surprised me was what appeared to be their total lack of interest in the European war . It was August , 1941 , the month when the Germans were sweeping through the Ukraine but had been tem ? porarily halted in the north at the Smolensk Gate . Our own fate was being decided as well as that of the Russians ; if they were beaten , it was hard to see how the English-speaking countries could hold out alone . But the battle was raging far from this magic moun ? tain , where , so far as I could see or hear , there was not even a radio to report the news . About two in the afternoon , the mailman came with letters and a single copy of The New York Times . It was seized and car ? ried away by one of the students who had formerly been a Young Communist and who , after losing his political beliefs , had retained the habit of reading the papers . Nobody seemed to mind . On Monday I suggested an experiment in automatic writing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classroom , sat at a long table and wrote at top speed for two hours . The rules of the game were that nobody should pause or erase and that everybody should say whatever came into his head . It is good training for writers , young or old , so long as it is re ? garded purely as an exercise . It teaches them to write fast ? a lesson I was never able to learn ? and to think at the typewriter . Sometimes it also reveals ideas or episodes or images that have been hidden away some ? where behind their conscious minds and that will make good stories or poems if developed later , consciously and at their leisure . Nobody was asked to read aloud what he had writ ? ten , but several of the students insisted on doing so . Their automatic writing was , in general , fanciful , gro ? tesque , humorous , with a certain amount of sexual symbolism ; sometimes a student would blush and skip a page . Sometimes he would speak with a firmer voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading of Franz Kafka ; here was something recog ? nizable by his audience as literature . I was impressed by the fact that there was not a single direct reference to tile war . There were several deeply felt harangues against the monotony of American middle-class life and one girl was obsessed by the fear of becoming a house ? wife in Bronxville . Nobody showed any realization that , if Hitler won ? as he then seemed to be on the point of doing ? middle-class life in Bronxville would become an impossible Utopia . During the week I held a two-hour conference with each student , reading his poems or stories and listen ? ing to his problems . One girl , a gifted poet of nineteen , told me that she had outgrown her excitement about society at large . The former Young Communist was writing Symbolist verse ; he worshiped Mallarm6 in the same fanatical spirit that he had once worshiped Marx . One evening the students gathered at their own suggestion for a reading from Rainer Maria Rilke 's Paris notebooks . These I enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unseif-protective candor of good diaries ; I may have been unjust to Rilke , but it seemed to me that he was too much concerned with his prose effects . Afterwards the class discussed the years when he had lived alone in Munich ( after serving briefly in the army ) and had scrupulously refrained from writing anything about the war . They thought he had followed the proper course . Listening to them talk , I began to feel that Rilke and Kafka , as literary symbols , were the equivalents of Eliot and Joyce after the other war , representing the same reaction against political interests and any com ? promise with the public taste . I began to feel that my calendar was shaped like a clock ; the hands had made a complete revolution , and now I was back in Cans-bridge at a meeting of the Harvard Poetry Society . Would Cummings read one of his early poems about a saintly harlot ? Or had the calendar made a double turn , and was I listening to the Rhymers ' Club in London before my birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner , explaining why he did not mind be ? ing separated from men and women : " In my library , " he said , " I have all the knowledge of the world that I need . " Remembering Johnson 's tragedy , and that of all his contemporaries except Yeats , I wondered whether writers learned anything but tricks of style from their predecessors . At the last meeting of the class I gave a lecture which , as I remember it , was pretty severe . I said in effect that by not making an effort toward intellectual and emotional understanding of what was happening in the world , the students were neglecting one of their chief duties as writers . Afterwards I received several interesting letters from them . One poet said , " I remem ? ber feeling there was plenty of evidence that I was n't unaware of what was happening , in spite of the phony statement that I had outgrown excitement about so ? ciety . In my stream-of-consciousness writing , did n't you notice the part about hands snagged on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And did n't I read the part about the refugee climbing a tree ? " She was right to scold me for lack of attention . Although none of the students had mentioned the war directly , there were several of these vague allusions that be ? trayed their worries . There was also a general mood of apprehension at the school that summer , leading to little quarrels and rebellions ; but there was no con ? scious interest in political events . The subject was sup ? pressed in writing and conversation , as sexual subjects used to be . It reappeared like sex in the form of indi ? rect symbols and irrational actions . These students on the magic mountain had special abilities and training , but in other respects they were not much different from the rest of their college gen ' eration . You could picture a whole age-group of young writers prepared to spend years in study and partial solitude while perfecting their ability to express a per ? sonal vision ? in other words , you could picture them as ready for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best might permit them to serve a long appren ? ticeship in the art of letters , something like the years that Flaubert spent alone in his mother 's house . The one thing for which they were not prepared , intellec ? tually or emotionally , was to be seized and transported into a world without solitude , where their time would be measured by the top sergeant 's whistle . All this helps to explain why very few young writers have come forward during the last three years : even those in civilian life are not yet adjusted to a new situation . Another wartime generation faced somewhat the same problems in 1918 , not to mention its troubles after-Yards . Fortunately the mistakes and delays of writers In their twenties are seldom fatal . For the last ten or a dozen years , American literature has been dominated by the writers who came of age during or shortly after the First World War ? that is , by Hemingway , Dos Passos , Fitzgerald , Faulkner and Wolfe among the novelists , by Cummings and Crane among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to mention a dozen other names In all fields . They had talent to start out with , but they also had special opportunities . Besides giving them an emotional shock , the war opened new perspectives and new countries . Money was plentiful in the postwar years , travel was cheap , leisure was possible and it was easier for new men to get a hearing . All these facts help to explain why so many of the writers admired today were born in the seven years between i 894 and 1900 . It may be that the generation coming of age during the Second World War will have an even greater opportunity . Partly it will depend on political events that are impossible to predict , but there is not much doubt that the public will be eager for new writers . I have no clear notion what these writers will say , and I should question whether their ideas before the war are a good indication of what they will think in the future . A better guide would be what they are thinking today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder whether the soldiers themselves have had time to make up their minds about it . If there is a post ? war disillusionment , it can hardly take the same form as in the 1920 's , considering that most young Ameri ? cans went into this war with comparatively few illu ? sions . I should expect that literature will be more personal , imaginative and lyrical than it was in the 1930s , and it may also be more affirmative ( though personally I distrust the word ) . For the rest , all one can say about it is that it will be interesting , and different .
