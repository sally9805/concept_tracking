In New York , there was some ripe political speculation . Handsome , strapping Brigadier General William O'Dwyer , late of the Allied Control Commission in Italy , returned to his $20,000-a-year job as Brooklyn 's District Attorney . Bill O'Dwyer promptly squelched a rumor that he had returned to civvies to run as Democratic candidate for Mayor of New York next fall against Fusionist " Butch " LaGuardia . <P> O'Dwyer 's emphatic denial brought forth hotter political dope : LaGuardia would run for a fourth term with Fusion , American Labor Party and Tammany backing . His re-election thus assured , he could stay at City Hall just long enough to run for U.S. Senator in 1946 with the same backing , and on a ticket with New Dealing Senator Jim Mead , as the candidate for Governor . <P> For years , " Butch " has wanted to be a Senator . For years , Jim Mead has wanted to be Governor .
