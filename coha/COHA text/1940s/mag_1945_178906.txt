The Institute of Radio Engineers was closeted to discuss military secrets . President W. L. Everitt leaned forward with a conspirator 's expression and solemnly announced : " Gentlemen , the Army &; Navy have now finally given , permission to use the word radar - provided you spell it backwards . " Washington has been grinning over this story for weeks . For censorship officers , the story has a double sting : they are well aware that radar has been one of the worst-kept secrets of the war . A favorite gag pictures a mother remarking to her husband : " John , do n't you think we ought to tell Junior about radar , before he picks it up in the street ? " <P> Last week it looked as if U.S. citizens ( and the press ) might soon be permitted to talk out loud about radar . The Army , Navy , Vannevar Bush 's OSRD and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics had set up a new Joint Board on Scientific Information Policy . Purpose of the Board was to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret to the Japanese . Scientists considered it high time . <P> For months it has been an open secret that a patent argument between U.S. and British inventors , rather than security , has been chiefly responsible for the hush-hush policy on radar . Thus far , the U.S. and Britain have failed to agree on a radar publicity policy which would satisfy the inventors ' conflicting claims . <P> The new Joint Board , headed by Dr. John Torrence Tate , a University of Minnesota physicist now working for OSRD , is intended to break the impasse . Its instructions : to prepare comprehensive public reports on radar and other wartime discoveries , notifying the British of release dates so that they will not be caught napping . Soon U.S. citizens will be able to get authoritative information about radar , one of the big unpublished stories of the war , before they pick it up in the street .
