The 600-mile trip back from Greenwich Island and Graham Land was ; rough and uncomfortable . Polar gales churned the iceberg-haunted seas until the transport Presidente Pinto ran for shelter among the rainswept islands north of Cape Horn . But Chile 's far-faring President Gabriel Gonzlez Videla was in high spirits . His voyage to nail down Chilean Claims to Antarctic territories also claimed by the British had made him the most popular man in his country . <P> Showman Gonzalez was not alone in the international claim-staking act . The Argentines were in a dispute with the British over Antarctic lands and the Falkland Islands ( Islas Malvinas ) . Argentine Task Force I , five ships with no fewer than five admirals aboard , had pushed south to visit the outpost on Deception Island . It made quite a show of power , especially since the Argentine hut on Deception is only 80 feet from the British base . But when the Argentines learned that the British had sent the 8,000-ton cruiser Nigeria from South Africa to the same waters , they cried out that sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonnage. " * <P> For the Voters . Nevertheless the Argentine show helped Pern at home . For once ( and just a fortnight before the congressional elections ) , the entire press stood with his government . Thundered the anti-Pern La Prensa : " No Argentine citizen will ever agree that his government should have to ask permission in order to occupy Antarctic lands belonging to the national patrimony . " <P> Guatemala hurriedly prepared to recognize both Chile 's and Argentina 's Antarctic claims , even though they overlapped . Argentine Tango Composer Enrique Dicpolas got a cable from Mexico City : " Word has reached here of the gallant posture you 've assumed in front of the intransigent British lion . It pleases me to offer you the Mexican fleet if Argentina needs reinforcements to defeat the English wherever they may be found . Because what are we ? Brave cats or miserable mice ? At your service . Signed : Juan Charrasqueado Scarface John-Mexico 's man-in-the-street and currently the subject of a popular song . " <P> For the Penguins . British Minister of State Hector McNeil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hague . Because Chile and Argentina based their claims chiefly on proximity and occupation , the British had a good case . They had sailed the Antarctic seas since 1773 , whaled there , set up a formal government for part of the disputed area in 1908 , and had organized more than half the expeditions ever sent into the Antarctic . Said the Manchester Guardian confidently : " Let Latin American oratory have its fling and the penguins applaud . It should be enough for us to put our case diplomatically . " <P> Gabriel Gonzlez of Chile was not even listening . As the Presidente Pinto approached the Strait of Magellan , he radioed triumphantly : " It is possible there is uranium in the Antarctic . I am personally carrying many ore samples that I will have analyzed in Santiago . "
