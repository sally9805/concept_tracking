In the polo-playing set around Fairfield , Conn. , Margaret Rudkin was merely the pretty , red-haired wife of a polo-playing stockbroker-until her son got sick . She thought that bread might be a good thing to build up his strength . Not store bread , but old-fashioned homemade bread . Mrs. Rudkin got out a bread recipe left by her grandmother . It called for flour to be milled by stone in the old-style way , quantities of whole milk and butter . So Mrs. Rudkin rolled up her sleeves , ground some wheat into flour in a coffee mill and baked bread in her kitchen . <P> The bread was fine for her son ; neighbors also found it fine . Like many Americans , they were tired of the mass-produced American bread scientifically refined until it is purified of almost all taste . At their urging , Mrs. Rudkin took eight loaves in a wicker basket to a nearby grocer . They were sold so fast that she set up a bakery of her own in the stable of her Pepperidge Farm , hired a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In three months she had sold $2,500 worth of bread . By September 1938 , the end of her first year in business , she had doubled and redoubled production , was turning out 4,000 loaves a week . <P> Rising dough . She found that she had to sell her bread for 25 a loaf , more than double the amount charged by the large bakeries . But she counted on the Pepperidge taste to carry the Pepperidge price . It did . <P> She expanded into the New York market merely by handing a slice of Pepperidge bread to the head of a Manhattan grocery store . The manager said he had n't tasted any bread like it since he was a boy . Within a short time he was ordering 1,200 loaves a week . <P> To supply her growing market Margaret Rudkin acquired a fleet of eight trucks , moved her plant from the stable into an empty service station in Norwalk . <P> For her whole wheat bread , she got two ancient , water-operated grist mills to grind the flour , stubbornly insisting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground in that antiquated way . As she continued to expand , she added melba toast , pound cake , etc. to the Pepperidge line . But she was careful not to expand so fast that she could not finance it out of earnings . In all , she has had to borrow only $5,000 outside capital and has kept the company a family enterprise . <P> She ruled her rising business like a benevolent despot . She paid wages higher than the industry level , instituted bonus and insurance plans . In return , she reserved the privilege of making them all work hard . Her employees , mostly women like the bonus- and Margaret Rudkin- enough to overlook her perfectionism As a result , Pepperidge has never been unionized.
