Fire fell on Kagoshima in the night , as suddenly as an earthquake , but with far greater violence . Peacefully , Kagoshima 's 200,000 Japanese citizens had gone to bed , leaving the city and naval anchorage brightly lighted . Then , at low level , the B-29s roared in . Two searchlights aimlessly fingered the sky and quickly paled into nothing as almost 1,000 tons of incendiary bombs turned the city into a flaming caldron . There was only one dark spot in the glowing mass : a baseball park . <P> Within a week , other secondary cities got the same treatment-Shizuoka , Toyohashi , Fukuoka , Kagamigahara . Small as they were ( under 325,000 population ) , they contained valuable war plants , arsenals , little " shadow factories " dispersed in flimsy dwellings . In some cases one raid was considered enough to write off the productive capacity of a city . One such case was the great naval arsenal at Kure , last big plant of its type . <P> The 21st Bomber Command had shifted to smaller cities because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , * the command 's good-looking , serious , young ( 38 ) chief , Major General Curtis E. LeMay , explained : " We have destroyed the five largest cities in Japan and any one of these would be a major disaster . We have done this with less than half the strength we will have in the Pacific . We have the capacity to devastate Japan and we will do so if she does not surrender . Missions of 1,000 planes will come before long . ... In a few months we will be running out of targets . " <P> <P> *At the controls of a B29 , General LeMay flew the 4,640 miles from Hawaii to Washington for a new nonstop record : 20 hrs. 15 min.
