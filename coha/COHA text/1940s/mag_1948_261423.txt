Beethoven : Concerto No. 4 ( Robert Casadesus , pianist , with the Philadelphia Orchestra , Eugene Ormandy conducting ; Columbia , 8 sides ) . Pianist Casadesus goes up against tough competition-Schnabel , Backhaus-in recording one of Beethoven 's greatest works , comes off a strong third . Recording ( on Vinylite ) : excellent . <P> Berlioz : Fantastic Symphony ( Concertgebouw Orchestra , Eduard van Beinum conducting ; English Decca , 12 sides ) . Berlioz ' blend of bombast and beauty is hard to resist in the performance of this great Amsterdam orchestra . Recording : excellent . <P> Handel : The Faithful Shepherd Suite ( National Symphony Orchestra , Hans Kindler conducting ; Victor , 4 sides ) . Conductor Kindler misses much of the warmth and grace of this fine music . Recording : fair . <P> Berg : Lyric Suite ( Galimir String Quartet ; Vox-Polydor , 8 sides ) . In this suite , one of his last works , the late Alban Berg ( TIME , May 31 ) put his teacher Arnold Schonberg 's theories to test , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve-tone technique . That still does n't make it very listenable to ordinary unpracticedears . Performance : excellent . Recording : excellent . <P> Vaughn Williams : Concerto for Oboe and Strings ( Mitchell Miller , oboist , with the Saidenberg Little Symphony , Daniel Saidenberg conducting ; Mercury , 5 sides ) . England 's Ralph Vaughn Williams composed this well-made , sweetly pastoral music during World War II . Vaughn Williams ( with the expert help of Soloist Miller ) makes even five sides of oboe pleasant to take . Performance : good . Recording : good .
