Six months ago in Washington , a squat dynamo of a man , full of strange contradictions and flashing talents , urged increased U.S. production of everything from bacon to bombers . " Bottlenecks , to me , " explained Lord Beaverbrook , " used to symbolize pleasure-now they 're a pain in the neck . " Last week , Max Aitken , once of New Castle , N.B. , now Lord Beaverbrook of London , stuck his neck out for new pains . He became Minister of War Production . <P> By giving Beaverbrook the second most important job in Britain , Prime Minister Winston Churchill answered in part the demands for War Cabinet reform which began eight months ago . <P> Lost in the shuffle was Labor Minister Ernest Bevin , conservative Laborite who was built up in early war days as the " strong man " of the people . Offered a " new job , " Ernie Bevin beamed , thinking he was to become production chief , then huffily refused the Ministry of Health . <P> These were the surface events . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire . <P> Not since 1776 have Americans been much interested in British politics . Few U.S. folk today know how Parliament works or whether the British have a constitution for their " constitutional mon archy. " * But before 1942 is out , what happens politically in England may have grave consequences in the U.S. and to the United Nations ' effort . <P> The question in blunt terms-blunter than England ever likes to be-is whether Britain is going Socialist permanently . Last week a sign of this " revolution " loomed high above the horizon in the shape of Sir Stafford Cripps 's well-molded head , lighted by his fierce black eyes . Sir Stafford , home from Russia , which he intensely admires in peace no less than in war , made clear that he proposed to be the head of the opposition to Churchill . With Englishmen saddened by their own defeats and praying for Red victories , Sir Stafford had a beautiful tactical position . Whether he would be merely a useful goad to spur Britain on , or whether he represented the coming Socialist revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more vitally interested spectators than the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution . <P> <P> *They do n't . The famed British Constitution consists of all the laws ever passed by Parliament-unless repealed . The whole thing could be abolished in a few hours-and several times has been , not counting the time when King Charles I was beheaded .
