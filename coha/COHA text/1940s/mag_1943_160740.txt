A Federal court recently killed a goose that had laid a huge golden egg for the University of Wisconsin . The Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco outlawed patents ( for enriching food with vitamin D ) which in 15 years had netted the University 's research outfit $7,500,000 . But Wisconsin still had this golden egg last week-in the form of investments-as well as ideas that may lead to a new era in university research . <P> Wisconsin 's big money-maker is a skinny , self-effacing biochemist named Harry Steenbock . Some 18 years ago he discovered that food could be enriched with vitamin D ( especially useful in preventing rickets in children ) by being treated with ultraviolet rays . <P> Well aware that his discovery spelled money , Steenbock pondered what to do with it . Tradition gave him three choices : he could 1 ) keep his university job and develop his invention on the side , as most professor-inventors do ; 2 ) quit the university and go into business to exploit his patents ; or 3 ) make a free gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of these . He decided , instead , to give his patents to Wisconsin to finance scientific research . Up shot was the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation . Administered by alumni leaders , the foundation is a holding company for patents obtained by Wisconsin research , each year turns its proceeds over to the University for further specified projects . <P> Professor or Percentage . Content with his $7,000 salary , Steenbock at first refused to accept royalties on his patents , but the University made him take 15% . Eventually , to the dismay of plain-living Harry Steenbock , this amounted to $50,000-$75,000 a year . The Research Foundation , meanwhile , grew rich beyond its dreams . Wisconsin professors began to produce a bonanza of new inventions ; today the Research Foundation owns some 30 patents , including one for the synthetic production of hormones . <P> The most valuable researches were still Steenbock 's . His ultraviolet-lamp irradiation process was sold to 250 companies for enriching milk , bread , animal feed , drugs , many another edible . ( The conscientious Foundation refused to let chewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do gum-chewers no good . ) <P> When a small Los Angeles firm , Vitamin Technologists , Inc. , began to irradiate in defiance of Wisconsin 's patents , the Foundation sued . The Circuit Court pointed out that the patents were so sweeping that a farmer who let his alfalfa lie under the sun 's ultraviolet rays would be an " infringer . " The Court ruled that Dr. Steenbock 's finding , though it put the world greatly in his debt , was a " discovery , " not a patentable invention . The Foundation will appeal to the Supreme Court . <P> However that suit is decided , other Wisconsin patents and the accumulated endowment will continue to produce income . Twenty other universities ( among them Oklahoma , Columbia and Purdue ) have already adopted Wisconsin 's idea .
