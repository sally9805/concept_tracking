Two of Manhattan 's favorite tabloid characters got married last week . The Rev. Adam Clayton Powell Jr. , 36 , wing-collared pastor of Harlem 's big Abyssinian Baptist Church and New York 's first Negro Congressman , took as a wife ( his second ) round-eyed , plump Hazel Scott , 25 , Bach-to-boogie pianist . Their wedding should have been a tabloid editor 's dream - a cast of stars , and a comedy of errors . <P> The bride , in knee-length white lace and satin , was seven minutes late to the wedding , and the bridegroom arrived 21 mintes later ( flat tire ) . Afterwards , every body adjourned to the bride 's place of business , Manhattan 's Caf Society Up town , where 2,000 guests were invited and 3,000 showed up . Then came the blowoff . <P> " Throw That Man Out ! " Trouble started when the Reverend Powell brusquely shooed news photographers away , so that a photographer could shoot some pictures for LIFE first . When one of the newsmen squawked , the bridegroom told a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news photographers did what they often threaten but rarely do , staged a sitdown strike . Terms : either the Reverend Powell apologized , or they would take no pictures . <P> Congressman Powell 's harassed publicity man pleaded in vain to the newsmen : " This is his wedding day and he just got excited . " Then he tried pleading to his boss to apologize to the boys . He came back muttering : " I 've worked for him for five years and he just insulted me ! " Result : photographers packed off without pictures . <P> What they missed was the kind of scenes that are butter to the tabloid 's bread . Samples : <P> The wedding cake was a replica of the White House , with a minister standing in the door , and a little Scottie labeled Fala playing on the lawn . <P> The bridegroom doggedly lasted out a double-row , round-the-block reception line , pumping the hands of the men and kissing the women on the cheek . The bride had to retire with a dizzy spell . <P> Twenty-five cops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudspeaker system finally sounded taps by telling the guests to leave : " It 's time for the next show . " <P> Duty Before Pleasure . Manhattan 's tabloid Daily News , sharing its cameraman 's pique , brushed off the wedding in a single sniffy paragraph . The good grey New York Times gave more space to the squabbling than to the wedding . Only the Herald Tribune , among all nine Manhattan papers , put duty before pleasure , and ran a fetching picture of the wedding- taken before the photographers walked off the job .
