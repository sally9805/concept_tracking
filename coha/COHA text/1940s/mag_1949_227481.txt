Premier-designate Paul van Zeeland pledged an " unflinching " fight for return of exiled King Leopold III . The Liberal Party shunned " rash decisions " on the royal question ; they wanted tax cuts first . The Socialists growled ominously : if Leopold came back , they would call a general strike . As the tense maneuvering between the parties continued , it seemed that Belgium 's royal question would have no easy answer .
