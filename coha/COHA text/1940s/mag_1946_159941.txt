New Yorkers , who thought they had experienced just about everything there was in the line of strikes , blinked incredulously at an item last week in their skinny , adless newspapers ( see PRESS ) . It was a short interview with Michael J. Cashal , first vice president of old Dan Tobin 's International Brotherhood of Teamsters , which was involved in New York City 's walkout of truck drivers ( TIME , Sept. 16 ) . Said Brother Cashal : " This strike is a rotten mess . " <P> It was indeed a mess . But it amused newspaper readers to see that a truckman could admit it . <P> Some 15,000 drivers of three teamster locals were out of control . They shouted down their leaders ' pleas to accept one proffered settlement , shouted down proposals to return to work pending an agreement on wages &; hours . They blocked many nonstriking drivers from working . They had just about choked off the metropolitan area 's supplies of food when Dan Tobin stepped into the situation . He telegraphed an order : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walkouts must end . <P> Wheels within Wheels . Tobin 's orders set hundreds of trucks rolling again . They averted an immediate food shortage , saved hundreds of thousands of workers from layoffs in building and other industries . But by week 's end the pinch applied by the three striking locals began to take effect . Two large food chains ( A. &; P. , Safeway ) closed their 730 stores ; about 1,000 other such stores were nearly out of supplies . <P> Then the mess deepened . Some 2,800 drivers and helpers of the United Parcel Service ( department-store deliverers , for the most part ) walked out in an unauthorized strike . Their complaint : they had not been paid for the time lost because of the general truck strike . Thousands of New Yorkers worried anew about their jobs-which were so closely geared to the wheels within the wheels of those big , loud , messy trucks .
