Six months ago , Britain 's WAAFs ( R.A.F. equivalent of WACs ) were forbidden to sing the sentimental German marching song Lili Marlene because it might give German prisoners of war ideas about fraternization . <P> Last week in Britain the idea of P.W . fraternization no longer seemed so objectionable . In the House of Commons , Tory Martin Lindsay rose to suggest that some P.W.s should even be encouraged to stay and marry . " The advantages in adding to our labor forces thousands of industrious , highly skilled workers would appear obvious , " he said , " besides there is today in Great Britain a 200,000 surplus of women of marriageable age . I am one of those people who believe that it is a great misfortune for women to be unable to fulfill their biological function because of a shortage of males . " <P> Parliament gave little indication of going all the way with M.P . Lindsay , but Britain last week seemed as anxious as most of the other victorious nations to hang on to its war prisoners . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven million Germans and Japs were still held prisoner in Allied countries . From Germany and her satellites Soviet Russia alone still retained an estimated four million . From Japan she held a million-odd more . Throughout the U.S.S.R. , in coal mines , lumber camps , vineyards , construction camps and factories , from Manchuria to the Urals , they labored for the glory of the new five-year plan . Shortly before the elections in Germany 's Russian zone , Moscow released 120,000 , but most of these were sickly , unskilled , or unfit for work . They made poor propaganda . " I wish he had never come back , " said one wife ; " month after month I have been waiting and now he sits there , staring at nothing , like a ghost . " Last week the first of Russia 's Japanese captives began to trickle home . The Russians had promised MacArthur that from ten to fifteen thousand would be repatriated monthly . At that rate it would be over five years before 800,000 soldiers and more than 200,000 civilians finally reach home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in her charge . Of these some 385,000 are in the United Kingdom , working in the coal mines , harvesting crops , tearing down air-raid shelters and clearing ground for new buildings among the debris left by five years of German bombing . In France , still desperately short of manpower , 700,000 German prisoners are rented out by the Government ( at a charge of approximately $1 a day ) to private employers . In Belgium , Holland , Scandinavia and the Balkans another 100,000-odd P.W.s are at work . <P> Of all the Allied nations , only the U.S. has made a determined effort to repatriate prisoners . In June 1945 the Americans had , mostly in Europe , a total of eight million captured Germans . Thousands were turned over to the French and British . Last week , the U.S. held less than 140,000 . Of these only 23 remained in this country . <P> In Guam 's Apra Harbor 2,100 Japs marched aboard a Jap-manned transport en route to their homeland . By December 50,000 more-the last U.S. prisoners in the Pacific-will be returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dutch have announced that they intend to keep another 13,500 indefinitely in Indonesia for dockside and other heavy labor .
