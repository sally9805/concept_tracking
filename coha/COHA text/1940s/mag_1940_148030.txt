Romney March , Corriedale , Polwarth , Southdowns , Ryelands are not the names of Pullman cars . They are the names of Australian sheep which grow one-fourth of the world 's wool , about 900,000,000 lbs . The U. S. , Britain , France , Belgium , Japan , Germany are ordinarily big buyers of it . <P> When World War II broke around wool men 's ears , Great Britain impounded the entire wool supply of Australia , plus New Zealand 's 300,000,000 lbs . For four months Britain sat on her wool , while U. S. mills which need Australian wool for apparel and blankets fidgeted and watched their supplies run low . The spot price of wool tops climbed from 82 to $1.31 a pound , and still Britain did not get around to releasing any for the U. S. <P> An Australian Central Wool Control was set up to manage the flow of wool , but no wool flowed . Even in the House of Lords , His Majesty 's Government got a rap on the knuckles for not telling the U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The war lid finally came off last week : 22,500,000 lbs . of Australian wool made available to the U. S. American buyers promptly bought 4,800,000 lbs . for $2,500,000 at prices about those for equivalent grades in the U. S. market . Purchases would have been larger but for the following factors : the buying season was at year 's low ebb ; the buying machinery creaked ; since the beginning of war U. S. mills had tapped South American and South African markets for about 50,000,000 lbs . Then the purchasers had a fresh worry : transportation . Because of war-interrupted shipping schedules , it may be considerably longer than the usual six or eight weeks before American mills can place the new supply on their own shelves .
