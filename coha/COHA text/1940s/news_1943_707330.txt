txt Gen. George C. Marshall , Chief of Staff of the United States Army , likened the situation in the European war theater today to a boxer who has taken the offensive and who is seeking to administer the knockout punch . To anolv the Wheeler ban on pre-Pearl Harbor fathers now , he implied , would interrupt the Army 's manpower goals , force changes in already-determined military strategy , and perhaps prove excessively costly in ultimate dollars and lives . " When you 've got a man on the run , " he declared before a packed and jammed session of the joint Senate and House military committees today , " the important thing is to keep him running .

However , he left no doubt , in the most forceful testimony heard on the single subject that is most agitating the returned Congress after its two-month vacation , that he wholly disapproves any interruption to the manpower supply to the Army now . " I must apologize if I express myself rather vigorously , " the United States top Armx official declared , " but I must admit I feel rather intensely about this . " Toddy 's hearing was the last open one on the controversial issue and one of the biggest shows the Capital has seen for a long time . Admiral Ernest J. King , Chief of Naval Operations , sat right beside General Marshall . Motion picture lights blazed and the big committee room was crowded .

He also explained that the limiting factor in rushing troops to Salerno was the factor of unloading troops and material at the debarkation points , " We have undoubtedly very heavy fighting in front of us and
