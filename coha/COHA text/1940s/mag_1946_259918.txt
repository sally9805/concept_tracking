The sun poured down on the wheat fields of Red River Valley and on the crowd gathered around a dusty truck . A sunburned farmer squinted appraisingly at a little man standing and shouting on the truck 's tailpiece . " He would n't be no account on a thrashin ' gang , " the farmer said . " But I reckon he 's smart . And he talks plain . " <P> The plain-shoutin ' little man was Fiorello LaGuardia , ex-mayor of New York , now head of UNRRA , who had swooped into North Dakota , wearing a pearl-grey sombrero . Secretary of Agriculture Clint Anderson , wearing a tie painted with pink and yellow apples , was with him-at LaGuardia 's urgent request . For two days they had scurried across Red River Valley , looking for wheat for UNRRA . <P> Eat Your Cake . In Fargo 's Gardner Hotel they faced pressmen , autograph hunters , bobby-soxers . Clint Anderson took the floor to explain that U.S. wheat farmers could now combine the 30 bonus with the previously announced " certificate plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat any time between now and March 1947 , no matter when they sell it . <P> Then Butch took over again , with his own explanation : " The mothers of the nation have spent years telling their children that you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . Now the kiddies can say , ' But Momma , Secretary Anderson says you can deliver your wheat and have it too . ' . . . You - can eat your cake and have it too . " <P> All Inspiring . At noon he and Clint Anderson sat down with Production Marketing Administration agents and Farmers ' Union bosses for a well-advertised starvation lunch : a cup of potato soup , one piece of bread ( no butter ) , one cup of coffee ( no cream or sugar ) . Butch lighted a cigar and looked slyly at the hungry diners from the northwest plains . Then waiters trooped in with salmon steak , potatoes , string beans , plenty of bread &; butter . <P> The well-fed farmers and agents told Butch not to worry : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is all inspiring , " yelled Butch . " For the past few weeks I 've been looking at charts and diagrams and figures . If I could solidify all the stuff I 've seen lately from these statisticians I 'd have enough fertilizer to take care of the fields of the nation for the next ten years . " <P> He bounced into a meeting of the Parent Teachers Association and told them a family secret : he was conceived in their home state . " When you hear people say that the mayor of New York was a wild man , " he cried , " remember that he was started in the Dakotas and brought up in Arizona . " * <P> An elderly teacher confided : " I always thought that man was a freak . Now I think he 's wonderful . " <P> The Real Thing . Across 70 miles of Red River Valley flatlands , past fields of new-seeded wheat , he and Anderson drove to Climax , Minn. ( pop . 253 ) . Some 3,000 farmers , wives &; children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded into a Northern Pacific train . " This is as near the real thing as I 've seen , " Butch exulted , and with a mouth full of tacks started hammering signs on the wheat cars : MORE FOOD FOR UNRRA.
