The Senator Was Indiscreet ( Universal-International ) offers some useful hints on how to become President of the U.S. <P> In the first place , the U.S. is a land of such glowing opportunity that no candidate need bother to have a brain . Senator Melvin G. Ashton ( William Powell ) can not even spell-but , with the help of a smart pressagent ( Peter Lind Hayes ) and a bit of blackmail , he very nearly makes the White House . <P> The Senator 's speech of acceptance is such a model of reluctance that one opposition paper headlines it : ASHTON BACKS INTO PRESIDENTIAL RACE . When his party boss ( Ray Collins ) tells him where to get off , he demurely mentions a diary in which , during 35 years of party hacking , he has noted down " Everything " - even What Happened in Boston ; yes , even What Happened in Denver . After that The Boys do not hesitate to get behind him heart &; soul . <P> On a triumphal tour of the nation , the Senator does practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow . In Virginia he uses a mushmouf accent ; in Texas he lines it with rawhide . In a union hall , wearing a miner 's cap , he shouts for an eight-day wage , a two-day week ; at a discreet banquet for bankers , he whispers for a two-day wage , an eight-day week . Elsewhere , discussing the problems of inflation and deflation , he takes his stand fearlessly , without compromise , " For Flation . " He also picks up an honorary Ph.D . from the Edgar L.

Tyrone Power keeps a medium-tight rein on his passionate Spanish nature ; Lee J. Cobb is a boozer who likes disguises ; Cesar Romero-a rather thin Stout Cortes-wears a rich black beard . Newcomer Jean Peters plays a pretty , vacuous runaway barmaid who is described , enthusiastically , as " a wench for the New World . " Thomas Gomez , in priestly robes , puts forward a few ill-chosen words in favor of the conquest of Mexico ( something a few centuries too soon , for a churchman of imperial Spain , about the happy day when all men , even Indians , will be equal ) .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
