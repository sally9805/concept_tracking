From Harry Truman down , Administration Democrats hate New Jersey 's J. Parnell Thomas more than they do any other Republican Congressman . It was his House Un-American Activities Committee which dredged up the embarrassing issue of Communists in Government and kept yammering away at it . And for more than a month , Parnell Thomas has been accusing the Department of Justice of negligence in failing to act against some of those accused in his investigations . <P> Last week the Justice Department acted-but it acted against Investigator Thomas . A Federal Grand Jury in Washington began looking into charges , repeatedly printed by Columnist Drew Pearson , that Congressman Thomas had padded his office payroll with the names of several people who did no work and who kicked back to him all or part of their salaries . Attorney General Tom Clark 's lawyers proceeded under a statute which makes it a criminal offense to issue false statements to the Government . Conviction carries a maximum penalty of ten years in prison and a $10,000 fine . <P> Although the proceedings were entirely legal , rednecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . cheap Pendergast politics .
