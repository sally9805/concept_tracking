The discovery was an accident . Copenhagen 's Dr. Erik Jacobsen , 45 , likes to try out new drugs on himself before giving them to his patients . One night before going to a dinner party he swallowed a couple of pills made of **28;11203;TOOLONG ; they were supposed to be good for intestinal worms . To his surprise , Dr. Jacobsen found that any form of alcohol revolted him . When he sipped even a small glass of beer , his face got red , his heart started to pound and he had trouble getting his breath . <P> The drug looked like a good bet for alcoholics . Other anti-worm medicines ( e.g. , the common cleaning fluid carbon tetrachloride ) are sometimes fatally poisonous when mixed with alcohol . During the past year , two of Dr. Jacobsen 's associates have treated 500 alcoholics with the drug ; they called it " antabus " ( from anti-abuse ) . By last week 450 of the patients still had a loathing for alcohol after only one dose of antabus.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
