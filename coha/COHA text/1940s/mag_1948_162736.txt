The Manchester Guardian 's Alistair Cooke has one of the hardest one-man jobs going : the entire U.S. is his beat . Frequently Cooke 's tours are too fast to be anything but flashy ; but sometimes he displays flashes of real insight . A few appeared last week in his reports on Republican hopefuls-Dewey , Stassen and Taft . ( He notably omitted any mention of Vandenberg . ) Excerpts : <P> " A sceptical visitor to the Governor 's mansion at Albany is shocked to find that the Governor 's lieutenants are not party hacks but men of national , even international reputation . . . That Dewey picks brains to flank his throne is obvious by now . That he wins them to enthusiastic loyalty is barely public knowledge . <P> " For there is a public image of him that not even his loyal lieutenants . . . can erase . It is of a foxy , withdrawn man , who labours after the one human quality that can not be laboured : friendliness , intimacy , humility . Americans are extraordinarily quick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner misgivings . . . <P> " He has gone after the Presidency with the humorless calculation of a certified public accountant in pursuit of the Holy Grail . At times it has not been a winning spectacle . . . He has a trick of hasty recovery , which makes many people feel that he is guided by no convictions but first wets his finger to the wind and then sticks his policies together , piece by fashionable piece . . . Fondness for the Churchillian sweep . . . is the showiest of his weaknesses . It ridicules his gift to learn and grow , which lately he has shown by his farming policies in New York , his shedding of an elocutionary manner , and his human admission that he wishes he were two inches taller . . . Though he would look foolish in Roosevelt 's cape , he would be a far finer administrator than Roosevelt ever was . " <P> " Stassen 's blood is thick enough to be stagnant . Maybe it is what gives him the appearance of heavy dependability . To any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubwoman , a Catholic priest . . . he gives the identical neutral treatment-a " grave , unhurried , unsentimental courtesy . . . His enemies , who are significantly often his former admirers , say Stassen will cure anything by seeming urgent , talking plain , and acting roundabout . . . " <P> " Robert Taft offers the blessed refreshment of an ambling , yet indestructible honesty . He is constitutionally incapable of enthusiasm , of dissembling , of eyeing the main chance . . . Such a dry , glamourless man , with his plain suits , his grapefruit-guileless face , his galoshes in case it rains , is the despair of campaign managers . . . Ask him . . . for his stand on any measure that is loaded with popular passion . . . ' Have n't made up my mind , ' he will say , lugging home a small library of books . . . He is a rare type in Congress . . . the able professional man , pursuing the life of reason , horned out of his slippers and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is the classic conservative , in the wrong century , and perhaps in the wrong country . "
