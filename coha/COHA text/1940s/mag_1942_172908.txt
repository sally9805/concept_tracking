One means by which infantile paralysis is spread far &; wide has been discovered . The common house fly , according to topflight Poliomyelitis Researcher Albert Bruce Sabin and Robert Ward of the University of Cincinnati , is a carrier of the disease . <P> In their report on polio made last fortnight in Science , they told how they and Yale experts John Rodman Paul and James Bowling Trask spent the summer catching flies , a summer job that may eventually help to bring poliomyelitis under control . <P> Last July and August , during polio outbreaks in rural Connecticut and Alabama , and in Cleveland and Atlanta , the doctors trapped thousands of flies in those parts . They mashed up the flies in sterile water or ether , gave it to monkeys in feedings , injections or nosedrops . Down came the monkeys with polio . <P> To the scientists ' surprise , infected flies were found not only in insanitary places , but also in " a Government housing project consisting of modern , clean , thoroughly screened and hygienic homes . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cans , all of which were covered . " In fact , Dr. Sabin noted , " there were so few flies about that it hardly seemed worthwhile to set out a trap . " <P> Dr. Sabin suggested that these findings may clear up the old mystery of why polio comes in the summer . And they further substantiate earlier theories that the disease comes from eating infected food .
