In ichthyophagous Japan , good fishing techniques are a matter of national importance . So the Japanese Government asked Dr. Tadayoshi Sasaki , of Tokyo 's Institute of Physical and Chemical Research , to work out a commercial way of using light to catch more fish . Last week Dr. Sasaki described a fiendishly clever system of luring fish to their doom . <P> At some distance offshore , Dr. Sasaki places a roughly V-shaped net . Inside the net , under water , he hangs a sealed-beam headlight bulb fed with current from a storage battery , the beam pointing out of the net . He hangs other bulbs , giving diffused light , in a long line toward the shore . <P> After nightfall , Dr. Sasaki turns on the lights . The fish , which are very fond of light , think it 's a party-or maybe a whole series of parties . They gather in swarms , cavorting around each light . When enough fish have gathered , Dr. Sasaki turns off the light nearest shore . <P> The fish , not yet ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . After a while Dr. Sasaki douses that light too . The fish move on , in a growing throng , like tipplers shunted from bar to bar by a series of closing hours . At last the only remaining light is the fatally attractive beam that beckons from inside the net . The fish swim in and Dr. Sasaki hauls up his net . In the cold light of dawn , the light-minded fish are headed for broiling ( yaki zakana ) . <P> One species , the austere grey mullet , seems uninterested in parties . But Dr. Sasaki is not discouraged . He is planning to try colored lights , in hopes that the stepped-up allure will attract the grey mullet too .
