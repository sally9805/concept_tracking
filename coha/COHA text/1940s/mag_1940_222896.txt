Most composers spend the early part of their lives in conservatories of music , where they learn to write potted fugues and hothouse symphonies . But no conservatory ever held Brazil 's bouncing , fiery Heitor Villa-Lobos . When he was six years old his lawyer father , an amateur musician , taught him how to play a lick or two on the cello . He taught himself how to play the piano . By the time he was 19 he was roving from one Brazilian settlement to another , playing in half-caste cabarets and straw-thatched cinema palaces . And he listened long and often to the jungly songs of Brazil 's Indians , the hot , oozing rhythms of Brazil 's primitive Negroes . With these in his inner ear , he started to write music-unorthodox , a new musical dialect made from aboriginal shouts and strummings . The salons of Rio de Janeiro made faces at it , thought it barbaric . But the peoes in the thatched huts ate it up . <P> When bluntspoken , disheveled Carioca* Villa-Lobos went to Paris in 1923 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't come here to study , " blurted he . " I came to show you what I have done . " When he had finished showing them his blunt , smoldering music ( much of it written for Brazilian tom-toms and gourd rattles ) , the Parisians decided he was a sort of musical William Saroyan . His Paris apartment became a rendezvous for admiring Left-Bankers . Villa-Lobos , who could n't afford to keep open house , threw them out , told them not to come back unless they brought their own food . Even on those terms , they came back . When Heitor Villa-Lobos returned to his native Brazil a few years later , he found that his European reputation had preceded him . He was Brazil 's No. 1 composer . <P> Last week in Baltimore Brazilian Pianist Guiomar Novaes and Conductor Hans Kindler 's National Symphony gave one of Villa-Lobos ' biggest works its first U. S. hearing . Called Momo Precoce ( The Young Momus ) after the ancient Greek god of ridicule , the composition depicted the sights &; sounds of Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After listening to its nave , childlike jingle themes , half-focused in a turbulent hubbub of flashy orchestration , Baltimoreans rated it one of the most bumptiously original pieces they had heard in a long time . <P> Meanwhile Villa-Lobos was in Brazil , hard at work writing more music , organizing and conducting outdoor song festivals for school children , revamping the teaching methods of Brazil 's Department of Musical Education , of which he is superintendent . Since 1931 , when he was named to this post , Villa-Lobos has concentrated his energies on spreading music in Brazil . At Sao Paulo , in 1931 , he staged the biggest musical event Brazil had ever known by conducting a chorus of 10,000 voices and an orchestra of 400 through a gigantic marathon of native music . Following year , he repeated the performance in Rio 's Fluminense Stadium with 18,000 school children . When the National Education Congress met at Rio in 1935 he had a chorus of 30,000 and an orchestra of 1,000.                @ @ @ @ @
