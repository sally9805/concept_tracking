REST CAMP ON MAUI A. Story EUGENE L. BURDICK Drawing by Corrado Cagli T HE rest camp was as ugly as a place can be in the IIawaiian Islands , which is saying that it was as ugly as slums in New York , mud flats in Georgia , or drought land in Arkansas . Bulldozers had scraped the foliage and trees off several hills and left them red and naked . The hills had been covered with tents and a few Quonset huts . The only tropical thing about the camp was the sun and the heavy , sweet sugar-cane odor which was laced with the sharper odor of flowers when the wind shifted away from the valley . Lieutenant Terry walked down a row of tents with the correspondent at his side . He stopped in front of a tent and pulled the flap aside to let the correspondent in . Three Marines stood up . A fourth Marine standing in front of a mirror was rubbing Aqua Velva on his face . He rubbed it with short , smooth strokes along his chin and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side of his ears . Terry watched the Marine rub the liquid on his face and said nothing . Then the Marine turned around and clicking his heels together , said , " Lieutenant Terry . " He said it in a mocking , affected way that meant he liked Terry and felt at ease with him . Terry started to speak rapidly : " Men , this gentleman here is a correspondent who wants to talk to you.for a while . Give him whatever informatiale wants andwe 'll check it later for security . Mr. Black , this is Sergeant Fellows , Corporal Young , Private Sclfensky , and Private Shannon . " By the end of the introduction the Marines all seemed relaxed and their faces went a little blank . They shook hands with the correspondent , squinting over his shoulder as they grasped his hand . Fellows was round and red , like a beery friar . " Glad to meet you , Mr. Black . Glad to help you any way we can , " he said . His voice was so flat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reluctant . He went back to the mirror and sprinkled some more Aqua Velva in his hands and started to rub his face . The correspondent picked up his knapsack and opening it slipped out a bottle of whisky and put it on the table , saying , " Something to help pass the afternoon . " The four Marines all heard the bottle come down on the table and turned to stare hard at it . The bottle looked big and new and shiny . Their faces were eager and individual now . Their eyes glistened and Fellows licked a corner of his mouth several times quickly , without looking away from the bottle . They turned and looked at Terry . It was against regulations to drink in camp and they watched to see what Terry would say . Terry looked at Fellows and winked and said , " I 'll be back for you in two hours , Mr. Black . " He turned and walked out the flap . Fellows laid out four heavy , metal mess cups and a chipped glass . He picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and unscrewed it . He poured out the whisky until the whole bottle was neatly divided into five equal parts . " I 'm not drinking today . Go ahead and use mine , " the correspondent said . Fellows looked up from the bottle and smiled at the correspondent . He picked up the chipped glass and split the whisky in it equally among the four metal cups . The whisky had a heady , rich odor that quickly filled the tent . Selfensky laughed and picking up a cup said , " Skol . " They rinsed their mouths with the liquor and the heavy fumes flooded up their noses and tickled beautifully . The strength of the whisky brought tears to their eyes and they swallowed it quickly . They all smiled at the correspondent and when he started to talk again the conversation was more relaxed . rr HE correspondent took off his cap and I laid it on the table . It was crumpled like the caps that Army pilots wear . It was cleverly bent and the wire stretcher had been removed from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal angle on some of these shows you 've been in , " he said . They felt good now and they grinned when he said " show . " Correspondents always said " show , " " bloody do , " or " rat race , " especially in the books they wrote . " I want to get your attitude on politics and women and how you feel about things back in the States . There were n't any women on Tarawa or Iwo , but how about the women in Sydney and the Hawaiian girls ? " Fellows started to talk loudly about the Australian chicks . The correspondent kept grinning and saying he could n't print that , but you could see he wanted to hear more of it . Fellows talked about the Sydney girls out at King 's Cross and down at Woolamooloo Dock and how at first they would always shack up with a girl apiece , but later when they got broke , a half dozen of them would all shack up with one girl to save money . The Marines hardly listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisky and smoked cigarettes . Lord , Young thought , it 's wonderful how good cigarettes taste when you suck in the smoke through the whisky breath of your throat . Usually Young liked to listen to the older fellows ' talk about women . He was only nineteen , the youngest man in his platoon . He 'd joined the Corps when he was seventeen and never had a chance to hang around girls much . He had never bad a girl , but he picked up the salty talk quickly and felt pretty sure that he sounded like any other Marine talking about women . Today he felt good and mellow , and leaning back in his chair he thought about the time on Okinawa . He and Fellows had been on a patrol on the northern end of the island and they had come to another one of those little villages that were almost deserted . As they walked past the little houses they saw a few stunted people disappearing around corners or sitting in front of the tiny houses . Even the dogs looked runty and little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband were seated on the ground . The husband was puffing on a small clay pipe and looking straight ahead . He looked as if he had been carved and lacquered , and he had a smooth , oily , little pot-belly that gleamed out of a hole in his shirt . The woman was seated with her back to the wall and she had dark , long hair . It was so black that it looked steel-blue . She must have been forty years old and her skin had an exquisite pattern of wrinkles over it , but somehow it looked soft and well cared for . Perhaps she had powder on her skin . It looked as if it might have a nice odor to it . Fellows laughed and said , " Look , " as he tossed her a small , wax-covered package of K-ration . It landed on her lap and she picked it up and examined it slowly and then looked up at the sergeant . A gift from a man in uniform could mean only one thing to her . She slid down until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still angled up against the house . She unfolded her kimono and drew it carefully back from her body until she was naked from the waist down . Young looked at her husband and he was still puffing his pipe slowly and looking straight ahead . The woman looked at the sergeant again and turned her head until the side of her face was flat against the rough material of the house . She closed her eyes . Young thought for a moment it was an odd movement of coquetry , but knew instantly it was n't . It was artless and completely uninspired , the movement of a tired animal . Lying in the sun on her kimono in the peculiar posture she should have seemed disgusting , but to Young she seemed very lascivious , although she made not the slightest movement and lay inert on the ground . Young said hoarsely , " Come on , Sarg , let 's get going . " yeh , " said Fellows , looking at the woman . " She 's probably got a lot of screwy Jap diseases we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as they went on through the village he said , " You know , kid , they always lay still like that . They 're screwy people . I had Asiatic duty once . I know the screwy bastards . " Young stopped in the middle of the street and suddenly vomited . He felt greatly relieved and laughed loudly as Fellows hit him on the shoulder and said , " Take it easy , kid , take it easy . " Later Young had thought of the woman when they 'd start to talk about their girls and wives and what they 'd do when they got back to the States . Fellows was still talking about the Aussie women and the correspondent was writing occasionally in a black notebook . Young moved behind him and read what he had written . " Marines like Auslie girls , but first love still clean-cut American girls . " ersitE correspondent 's pen moved across I the notebook again . " Jews in the Corps . Personal , human angle ? " He looked up . " How have the Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them a good write-up in my book , " he said . Fellows nodded at Selfensky and said , " Ask Selfensky , he 's a Jew . " Selfensky looked straight at the correspondent for a moment and the Marines knew he wanted to talk about Lieutenant Cohen . Usually Selfensky clammed up when someone made a mistake and talked about Jews in front of him . but today he felt loose and oily inside and talkingseemed easy . He chewed at his lip , trying to form words , and then the correspondent said , " Yeah , Selfensky , you probably know more about this than anyone here . You know , some of my best friends are Jews . Damn fine fellows , I really like them . " Selfensky 's face went a little hard and he stopped chewing his lip and said , " Ask Fellows . I do n't know hardly anyone outside my company . " " Yeah , yeah , I know just about everyone in this damn division , " Fellows said . He started telling the correspondent about Horowitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-Marine show . Selfensky took a sip of the whisky and he felt a little tight and beautifully lightheaded . He had n't thought about Lieutenant Cohen for a long time . Selfensky remembered how proud he had felt when he got the word that his company was getting a Jewish officer for a platoon leader replacement . There were only a few Jewish enlisted men and no Jewish officers in his company . He had been disappointed when he first saw Cohen . He was of medium height and had dark eyes and long and very white graceful hands . Selfensky had hoped he would be a big rugged Jewish football player like Sid Luckman or a huge , fast , powerful boxer . Cohen was very quiet and kept to himself , but he was marvelous on weapons . Instead of field-stripping his platoon 's weapons on a clean , canvas-covered table he made them take them out in the sand in a fox-hole . They had to strip them with their eyes bandaged and put the parts in their pockets to keep them from getting sandy or losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . He was always asking questions about new gear and equipment and remembered most of it . Once he took a two-day pass and went to visit a tank outfit . When he came back he could drive a tank . The men started to like him . One day a big Polack had called Cohen a kike . Loud and clear so that Cohen could hear it , and then looked at Cohen so that he could n't ignore it . Cohen told him to report to the back of the rifle range and about twenty men drifted along to see what would happen . Cohen took his shirt off and said , " Corporal , take off your shirt . " The Pole was a little nervous , but he laughed when he saw that Cohen was actually going to fight him with no rank or rate showing . He outweighed Cohen by forty pounds . Cohen stood very straight and white and said , " Corporal , I ca n't possibly beat you in an ordinary fist-fight . This is going to be a no-holds-barred fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's OK with me , " the Pole said . Selfensky felt sick and wondered if he should try and stop the fight , but the Pole had already started after Cohen . The Pole hit Cohen twice hard blows on the chest . Then Cohen seemed to be all over the Pole , like a mongoose after a dog . He kicked the Pole hard in the shins and as the Pole straightened up Cohen had his finger inside the Pole 's lip and ripped it back from the corner of his mouth . The Pole kept hitting Cohen hard , but he was a little scared now . Cohen went after his hands next and when they separated he had broken the little finger of the Pole 's right hand . It hung back from his hand at such an impossible angle that it hurt you to look at it . Cohen drove his knee into the Pole 's groin a couple of times and Selfensky could see panic in the Pole 's eyes . The Pole tried to kick and knee too and that ended it quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face . The Pole got weaker and soon his knees buckled and he put his face in his hands and sank to the ground . The broken little finger stuck straight out from the other fingers curled around his face . The Pole turned into sick bay and said he 'd been in a fight with some civilians . Cohen visited him in the hospital and when the Pole got out he transferred to Cohen 's platoon . Cohen still worked his men hard and by the time they were ready to stage for Iwo his platoon was the toughest in the company . The men were lean and hard and they all looked tougher than Cohen , whose hands were still white and graceful looking . HEIR company went into Iwo on D 1 plus 2 . Selfensky remembered how much like practice it all had seemed asthey went down the nets into the ECVP 's and circled around waiting for the rest of their wave . They joked and kidded a bit and a BAR man pretended he was seasick over the side . It did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach and could hear the mortars trumping and could see the F6F 's suddenly leave their 500-pound bombs hanging still in the air and then the bombs would start to speed up and go so fast you could hardly see them as they hit into the big mounds of sand and exploded blackly . As soon as the platoon hit the beach , however , and started to muck through the black volcanic sand , things did n't look so good . The first thing they saw was an aid station that had been hit . There were broken plasma bottles hanging from rifles and a long stream of bandage unrolled neat and white across the black sand . Cots and crates and blankets were all smashed together and big , tarry clots of blood and flesh were plastered over everything . The corpsmen had already set up a few yards down the beach , but you could tell that they did n't expect to stay there long . Funny how corpsmen always looked like kids . Even the middle-aged men looked like kids when they wore the big helmets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like kids playing soldier . They moved off the beach fast and alongside the air strip , avoiding the little flags that indicated mines . The mortar fire started to pick up . They hit the line very soon and found the outfit they were supposed to flank . There were a lot of dead Marines around , but no one was bothering about them and Selfensky wondered where the , Daps were . He had n't seen a Jap body or a Jap position yet , although the machine-gun fire was heavy now and occasionally there was some artillery fire . Then a company runner arrived and gave Cohen a field dispatch and he moved the platoon to the right and into a big shell hole . " We 're going to clean out that pillbox on the hill , " he said . " We 'll have tank support and everyone except the BAR men keep close to the tank . BAR men keep the pillbox under fire all the time . A couple of grenades ought to do it , but do n't pitch one until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the low hill and Finally saw the long , camouflaged slit . It looked like a crevice between two rocks , but occasionally there would be a stream of smoke-puff from it . They had to wait a half hour for the tank so they broke open their K-rations . Selfensky did n't like the candy in the ration and traded it to another man for the little can of cheese . The tank came early , lumbering down the side of the air strip , with dust thick and black all over it . Wherever there was grease on the tank the dust bulged out in huge mounds , like soft , black cancers growing out of the steel . The tank did n't stop when it came to their shell-hole , but the turret swung toward them as if in question and then turned back toward the pillbox . The gun barrel pointed at the pillbox like a long , commanding finger . They threw the paper and tins into the bottom of the hole and started out behind the tank . At once the fire started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pillbox was firing fast now and the smoke puffed steadily out of it . The BAR men lagged a little behind and suddenly they started to fire into the pillbox . You could see the hot , angry tracers powdering the stone around the pillbox and smoke stopped coming out of it . MHEY were only a hundred yards from I the pillbox when they all heard the first screaming ricochet of an anti-tank shell . Mortar projectiles do n't ricochet , they just plop into the ground and explode , but high velocity anti-tank projectiles will ricochet off almost anything . The turret of the tank spun around frantically trying to locate the anti-tank gun . All you could see was dust and mortar shells exploding and ugly little hills held together by dust and great chunks of concrete that you could n't see . There were two more snarling ricochets and then the fourth round shattered into the tank . It made a terrible ringing sound and Selfensky 's ears stopped hearing for a minute and he felt a sharp , cold pain at the base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and the tank captain came out behind it . The -t , a the tank captain turned slowlyover in the air , the tank captain 's clothing shredding away from him in the air . When he hit the ground he lay there white and broken and naked . The tank was smoking , but the motor was running smoothly . The dust had been shaken from the tank and the green and brown camouflage paint looked smooth and new . Selfensky felt fear grip his stomach and suddenly felt very exposed against the sand . He wished he had had a bowel movement back in the shell hole . He heard his name called and looking up saw Cohen lowering himself into the hatch of the tank and motioning to him to follow . Inside , the tank was hot and dusty and the sweat started to stand out on Selfensky 's face . He felt secure inside the thick steel walls despite the hole in the side of the tank and the two men who had died , looking over their shoulders into the turret . Cohen boosted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hatch and let him slide to the ground . The driver was harder to get out and Selfensky was sweating hard . He was feeling better all the time , however , and he was amazed at how safe and snug a tank was . He looked at the hole in the side e ? the tank and saw that the steel was several fingers thick . Damn it , this was all right ! Cohen looked up from the driver 's seat and said , " Tell the Pole to take over the platoon and we 'll try to get up to the pillbox . " The tank started slowly up the slope and through the periscope the pillbox slit got larger and suddenly smoke started to puff out of it again . Selfensky could feel the bullets hitting the side and bouncing off and he grinned down at Cohen . Cohen 's greens were dark with sweat now and his large white hands were moving over the controls rapidly . They were about fifty feet from the pillbox when a scrawny little Jap started to slide sideways out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge in his right hand . The Jap came hopping bow-legged down the hill , his face all contorted and probably yelling . He had covered about half the distance to the tank when he started to stagger . It looked as if someone were hitting him with an invisible sledge hammer . His forehead dissolved in a red splash and his legs snapped back from under him as the BAR slugs tore into them . Sudden red decorations started to spread over his shirt . He smacked backward into the ground and the satchel charge slipped from his hand . Cohen stopped the tank and crawled over into the gunner 's position . He did n't know how to work the sight , but at this range he could fire by eye and not miss . He fired five rounds into the slit and when the pillbox looked like a smoking black eye in the hill he stopped . C OHEN grinned up at Selfensky and started the tank back down the hill . They were about halfway down when they hit one of the 500-pound aerial bombs the Japs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that the tank flopped over on its back and lay there like a great , helpless turtle . Selfensky only remembered coming to and knowing he did n't hurt anywhere , and almost immediately he knew where he was . Cohen was hanging fate down from the driver 's compartment and the explosion had clamped the compartment around his legs . He hung from his knees down into the turret . Selfensky was puzzled at Cohen 's position for a few minutes and then he started to crawl toward him . At once he heard a rasping sound and a great pain inched up his leg . The bone was sticking almost straight out from his leg and when he moved he had pulled it across the rough surface of the tank He looked again at Cohen and hoped he was dead because he was sure to lose both his legs . Cohen 's voice sounded low and clear in the hot turret , " Take it easy , Selfensky . Stay where you are and they 'll get you out of here . " Cohen 's eyes looked big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . He tried to turn his head so he could see straight into Cohen 's face , but Cohen said , " No , no , Ski . Take it easy , boy . " Selfensky 's whole body ached to have Cohen die or faint before he looked up and saw his legs . " Two little Jew-boys gone astray , eh Lieutenant , " Selfensky said and wondered if it sounded funny . Cohen closed his eyes as blood started to bubble out of his nose down into them and Selfensky reached over and wipedthem out . The eyes opened and Were big and soft again . Cohen started to sing and Selfensky could n't place the words for a while . Then he remembered the song . He 'd learned it long ago at the synagogue and forgotten it . He started to sing softly with Cohen . Cohen sang beautifully , like a cantor . The words sounded big and glorious in the tank . It sounded like many voices singing . Selfensky felt that his voice was huge and powerful and a queer exultation seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but gradually Cohen 's voice became softer and then it stopped . Selfensky hated to look up because he knew that if Cohen 's eyes were open and big and soft he 'd go crazy . Finally he looked up and Cohen 's eyelids were closed and there was a stream of blood from each nostril that ran out his nose , across the eyelids , and into the dark hair . Selfensky reached out and took Cohen 's cold hand and started to say the old Jewish prayer for death : " . . 0 , may death be an atonement for all the sins , iniquities , and transgressions of which I have been guilty before thee . . . " He was holding Cohen 's hand and sitting in the same position when they came and cut the tank open with a welder 's torch . UELLOWS had just finished telling the r correspondent about the show Horowitz had put on . How he 'd dressed up a bunch of big Marines like women and brought them out as a chorus line . " It was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut coconuts in two and they wore them under brassieres . They did an awful dance and one big gook fell on his butt twice . Then one of them dropped a coconut out of his brassiere and it bounced on the deck and that really brought down the house . So they all started dropping them out on purpose and pretty soon the whole deck was covered with them . Horowitz was mad about that but it sure made a good laugh . " Fellows was red-faced now ; sweating a little . He had just enough whisky left in his cup to twirl around and he was waiting before he drank that , He kept thinking he would n't see any more for a long time . Fellows wished suddenly that he had a whole quart to start in on . He could drink forever and not get sick or sleepy ; he 'd just keep feeling better and better . The correspondent had an indifferent look on his face and they all knew this was n't the kind of stuff he wanted to hear , but they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notebook again and Fellows could see the words : " Jewish boys in the Marines , famed for their entertainment on Broadway and in Hollywood , arrange musicals , shows , and other laugh-fests to keep America 's finest fighting men relaxed between battles . " " Where does this Horowitz come from in the States ? " the correspondent asked . " People like to read about where the boys come from . " " Oh , he came from Nebraska . His old man had a peanut farm or something out there , " Selfensky answered . " Not so good , Ski . " The correspondent winked at Selfensky , " Jewish boys should come from Brooklyn or Chicago . Gives them more human interest . " The correspondent looked at the empty bottle and Selfensky could see that he was measuring the dope he had got against the whisky and feeling cheated . " Any of you boys pick up any medals in these shows ? " the correspondent asked , changing the subject rapidly . The Marines looked at one another for a second and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laugh . " Sure , we all got the Purple Heart , " Fellows said . The correspondent shook his head patiently . " No good . People expect Marines to have Purple Hearts . Any other medals aside from that ? " His voice hung somewhere between irritation and patience . " Yeah , Shannon there has a Silver Star and a Navy Cross . He 's got so many medals that they had him go on a bond tour back in the States . " Shannon held back the good , loose feeling in his head and chest and grinned at the correspondent . " That must have been a pretty fast life after being out here for a couple years . I 'll bet you were anxious to get back to your outfit after all those cocktail parties and speeches by politicians , " the correspondent said . " No , I liked it . They sent me back right after Iwo and it was swell . Lots of good food ; I gained twenty pounds the first month back . They always fixed me up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl for three years . Some of the girls still write me . It was a hell of a lot of fun . Everyone was swell to me and the workers at the plants would come up and ask questions about their kids in the Corps and take me out to their homes for dinner . I hated like hell to come back out . " Shannon 's grin had faded to a serious smile and the other Marines were looking at him oddly . " I do n't know , Shannon , " the correspondent said . " What would you say if I wrote you up as being more scared by the speeches and the good-looking girls than you ever were on Iwo ? I 'll put your name in it and it ought to make a good story . People like that human interest angle . What do you say ? " The correspondent was mildly excited about the new angle . He did n't notice that the Marines were all quiet and they were watching Shannon . S HANNON was not smiling now and he was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long hot months of training ; the nights in combat he had urinated into his pants rather than look for the pit ; the grease-packed K-rations ; the sleep that was not sleep , but unconsciousness ; the pfc who threw himself on a grenade that had been dropped by accident and whose body jumped two feet into the air and fell back a crumpled sack of khaki ; the warm canteen water that turned the dust in his throat into mud . All these his mind telescoped into one experience . He laid it next to the memories of the laughing girls and iced lemonade and the keen exhilaration of three beers and the fragrant pork roasts and blue water in country streams and the yellowing corn . Shannon smiled uncertainly over his shoulder at Fellows . He felt a sudden relief , for he could tell that Fellows knew what the correspondent meant . Fellows finished off his whisky and looked in the bottom of the cup and put it on the table . He stood up and walked over in front of the correspondent . " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His voice sounded a little tired , but the words came like cold drops of metal out of his mouth . The correspondent looked up , startled , and started to say something . " Get out , you lousy bastard , " Fellows said again . His face was n't red any more and there was even a little white around the nose . He was n't the slightest bit drunk . " Look , old man , you do n't understand . ? . . " the correspondent started to say . " Come on , bum , move on , " Fellows said , and walked back to his chair . Five minutes later the correspondent MAGAZINE went into Lieutenant Terry 's tent and said he was ready to go back to town . Terry looked at him and started to whistle . " How did you make out ? " he asked . " So , so , they did n't have a hell of a lot to say . A little too prima-donnaish , " the correspondent answered . They went back down the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea came into view , sparkling and blue , Terry started to sing : There 'll be no promotions , This side of the ocean , So cheer up my lads , Bless ' em all .
