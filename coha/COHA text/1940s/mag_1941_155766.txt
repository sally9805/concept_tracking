At Jutland she was a newfangled seaplane tender named Engadine . Now she was the Corregidor , a dumpy , inter-island steamer , and doom hung above her as she pulled away from the dock at Manila . <P> Aboard her were a few commercial men , headed south for stops in the Visayans and Mindanao , and a great many men , women and children who wanted only to leave Japanese-bombed Manila . Of the 860-odd passengers , hundreds had no tickets , had crowded aboard with only one thought : to get away . <P> Blacked out , she was led by a Navy launch toward the minefield sown in the harbor 's mouth beyond Corregidor 's forbidding heights . Somehow in the dark she ran past the launch . The warning shout from the launch was lost in a vast red explosion . The old Corregidor , her hull burst , settled in shark-ridden waters . <P> Of her passengers , some 500 died beyond the reach of Navy patrol boats that fearlessly whisked through the minefield . <P> Among the missing were two members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wispy President Manuel Quezon . Said he : " My heart goes out to the families of those who perished in this terrible accident , some of whom were dear personal friends who had rendered signal public service . "
