Walter Hendricks had a good , secure job , teaching English and the humanities at Illinois Tech ; he had been there for 25 years . But he had always had another kind of college in his mind 's eye : a small one , about town-meeting size . Hendricks thought he knew just the place for it . <P> For 15 summers , he had spent his vacations on a farm high on Potash Hill , in the nearly deserted Vermont hamlet of Marlboro . Marlboro had once been a flourishing center , but its industry and population had gradually dwindled until three years ago even the postofice shut down . Now a few houses , clustered around a little church and a long-closed inn , were all that remained . Hendricks bought the 150-year-old farm next door to his own and set to work . <P> Pie &; Pigs . In Vermont 's hills , he found friends to back him . Over apple pie &; cheese , Hendricks unfolded the scheme to Poet Robert Frost . " I 'm going to start a college , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be durned . I always wanted to , myself . " <P> As Hendricks left the Frost cottage , with the poet 's promise to lecture at the new college , the aurora borealis was flashing across the skies ; Hendricks took it as a good omen . At midnight he reached the home of another summertime neighbor and friend , Dorothy Thompson . She liked the idea , too , and agreed to help . So did Author Dorothy Canfleld Fisher , Explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson , Pianist Rudolf Serkin . <P> Things have been humming ever since . Last winter , Serkin and his father-in-law , Violinist Adolf Busch , gave a benefit concert in nearby Brattleboro and raised $3,800 to start the money-raising ball rolling . All summer , carpenters and masons have pounded nails and poured concrete to convert the colonial farmhouses for college use . For weeks an advance party of prospective Marlboro students has been working too . That is part of the Hendricks idea : at Marlboro , city-bred students will learn to use their hands : raise pigs , tap maple trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College is ready to open its doors , officially on schedule , but there is still plenty of work to be done . The dirt road from Molly Stark Highway to Potash Hill needs a macadam surface . The college " laboratories " - war- surplus huts from an army air base-have not arrived . <P> Call Me Mister . For the first year , at least , Marlboro plans to admit only 100 students , 60% of them ex-G.I.s , with New England solidly represented . Faculty members will have no ranks or titles ; just plain " Mister " will do . ( Hendricks picked up that idea at the American University in Biarritz , where he taught English to G.I.s in World War II . ) The college will have no rules except those voted at a " town meeting " of faculty and students . <P> There will be no departmentalization . " We are interested , " says Hendricks , " in broad general education , cutting across the narrow lines of specialized interest . . . . We want to integrate the learning of all branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want our students to learn at the same time the history of the period which they are studying . We want faculty members who , in a political science course , can teach a little literature . . . .
