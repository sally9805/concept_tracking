JONATHAN EDWARDS ( 348 pp. ) - Perry Miller-Sloane ( $3.50 ) . <P> On the horizon back of Boston in 1740 , there appeared a swirl of religious excitement no bigger than a preacher 's warning forefinger . A Bostonian described it with disgust : " The meeting was carried on with . . . some screaming out in Distress and Anguish . . . some again jumping up and down . . . some lying along on the floor . . . The whole with a very great Noise , to be heard at a Mile 's Distance , and continued almost the whole Night . " <P> Yet in a few months the swirl became a whirlwind of religious frenzy that dragged all New England into its vortex . Whole towns went into visions and transports ; preachers swarmed over the countryside to drive " the nail of terror into sleeping souls " ; debts were forgiven , work was forgotten . Before the wind of the Great Awakening died , it had almost blown the Puritan state apart . <P> How Large Is Thought ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwards , a powerful preacher , and one of the keenest theological minds of his time . He was also , says Harvard 's Perry Miller in his careful study of Edwards , " one of America 's five or six major artists , who happened to work with ideas instead of with poems or novels . " His art falls on modern ears as queerly as a voice speaking through a 200-year-long speaking tube , but his thought comes clear , like a prophecy fulfilled . And behind Jonathan Edwards ' thought , expressing it more grandly than his art was ever able , stands his life , an American tragedy . <P> Jonathan Edwards was born to the Puritan purple . His grandfather was Solomon Stoddard , the " Pope " of the Connecticut Valley , less known to history than Cotton Mather but far more powerful in his day . Jonathan was a boy wonder . At twelve , he wrote a masterly little treatise on spiders . Nearly 13 , he entered Yale , where he studied the philosophy of John Locke and the new science of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tools , and with them he began to work on the carved ice of Puritan theology . " How large is that thing in the Mind which they call Thought ? " he cried . " Is Love square , or round ? Is the surface of Hatred rough , or smooth ? Is Joy an inch , or a foot , in diameter ? ... It is no more reason that immediately perceives . . . the beauty or loveliness of anything . . . than it is reason that perceives the sweetness of honey : it depends on the sense of the heart . " <P> Would God Be Safe ? At 23 , Edwards went to assist his aging grandfather at the Northampton church , and later that year he married Sarah Pierrepont , a religious girl who " seems to have someone invisible always conversing with her and to be always full of joy and pleasure ; and no one knows for what . " <P> It was a strange marriage . Jonathan rose at 4 a.m. , spent 13 hours a day in his study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rides he took paper and pins , and whenever he had a thought , he pinned a paper to his coat ; Sarah , according to legend , had the pleasure of unpinning him .
