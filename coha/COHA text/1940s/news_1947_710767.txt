txt BOSTON , Mass. , Sept. 26 ? The Convention of the United ' Electrical , Radio and Machine Workers , CIO , charged today that the foreign policies of the Truman administration were controlled by " Wall Street " and were designed to " suppress and exploit the people of the world . " . A. resolution to this effect was adopted by a margin- of at least eight to one over the objections of the union 's anti-Communist minority . Members of the right-wing group likened the resolution to the speech made in the United Nations General Assembly last week by Andrei Y. Vishinsky , Deputy Foreign Minister of Soviet Russia . They characterized the convention 's action as " a stab in the back " for the United States delegation in the United Nations . . Supporters of the majority position retorted that the real threat to American workers did not come from Russia but from the " assault of monopolists on democratic forces at home and abroad . " The right-wing group , led by James B. Carey , national secretary-treasurer of the Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the columns of the union 's newspaper be opened to replies by its members to attacks made upon them by the union leaders . In another action of its closing session , the convention amended the union constitution to Bar locals suspended by the general executive board from representation at any union meeting or convention . Members of the Carey faction , who have been threatened with expulsion if they did not halt their anti-Communist activities , // attempted unsuccessfully to block the amendment . As the 1,000 delegates began returning to their homes , the right1 wingers , who call ' themselves " UE Members for Democratic Action , " announced their determination to defy the dissolution order voted against their committee by the convention . Major interest today attached to the foreign policy resolution . This was by far the sharpest attack on the American position yet made- by any national union . Its basic theme was that , since the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt , control of our government had passed into the hands of " big business . " Wall Street Rule " a Burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden upon the American people , " the resolution asserted . " The workers ' unions are harassed , " the resolution continued , " the nation 's civil servants work in dread , inquisitors , spies , informers creep through our government , our cities and our factories . Wall Street undermines our people 's democratic liberties to chain us to the moneybags of the trusts . " The resolution asserted that it was " the policy of the trusts to re-establish a reactionary Germany as economic dictator over Europe . " Despite this , the people of the world were assured that the American people would not " make war upon them nor burn them alive with atom bombs to enforce the re-establishment of the interna1 tional monopolies . " " We demand that our relations with the rest of the world be taken out of the hands of the trusts , " the resolution declared . Wallace Speech Reprinted To those who contended that the resolution was identical in tone with the accusations directed against our government by Mr. Vishinsky , defenders of the motion replied that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention 's opening session by Henry A. Wallace . The Wallace speech has been reprinted in pamphlet form for distribution among the union 's 600,000 members . William Drohan of Local 1102 , St. Louis , a Carey supporter , said the resolution made it appear that all the trouble in the world could be cured if the Soviet army were " called over here to rescue usl from the hole we are in . " As minority members of the resolutions committee , Messrs . Drohan and Carey appealed to the convention to back a resolution calling on President Truman to make clear in our foreign policy " that the ' United States will not support or condone either the extension in other countries of totalitarian Communist dictatorship or the perpetuation or re-establishment of fascism or dictatorships under outworn or decadent monarchies . " Irving Krane of Local 1150 , Chicago , assailed the minority proposal as " a Don Quixotic attack against windmills . " Other speakers joined in berating the rightwing group . These attacks drew from Frank Blechinger of Local 101 , Philadelphia , a complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor without rebuke to criticize American policy , while members of the Carey group were labeled " Red-baiters . " To Combat NAM Efforts Informed that the National Association of Manufacturers and other employer groups intended to spend millions of dollars this year . on publicity campaigns , the convention authorized an expansion of the union 's own publicity efforts . It was urged that special attention be given to carrying the organization 's story to young people , from the kindergarten to college . In opposing the entire resolution dealing with publicity , the Right Wingers maintained that the principal purposes of the material issued by the union were to advance " alien political views , to glorify the leaders of the union and to condemn all who disagreed with them . " The general executive board was empowered to increase the salaries of the three national officers from $6,000 a year to $7,500 . The maximum salary for international representatives was raised from $80 a week to $90 . Other resolutions called for a Federal veterans ' bonus of $3 a day for service in this country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonus of $500 for each war injury ; liberalization of the GI Bill of Rights and increased employment and housing for veterans ; expanded Social Security legislation ; passage of the MurrayWagner-Dingell health insurance bill , and revisions in the tax laws to raise taxes on large incomes and reduce those on small incomes .
