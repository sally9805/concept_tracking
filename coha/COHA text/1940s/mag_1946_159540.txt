Spring was just around the corner . The U.S. Military Government felt the seasonal compulsion , and broke out with bright buds of optimism . First , Colonel Frank L. Howley , governor of Berlin 's U.S. sector , heartily hailed the " unqualified success " of the joint occupation during its first six months , cheerily added the tactless and probably inaccurate boast that the U.S. now was the most influential power in Berlin . Hard on Howley 's heels , General Joseph T. McNarney , commander of U.S. forces in Europe , reported that food stocks in the U.S. zone were surprisingly ample . <P> Just as General McNarney left for a vacation in Switzerland , news came from the British zone which froze all the optimism . " With great regret " and as a result of " unforeseen developments , " the British slashed their zone 's rations by about 33% . <P> Caloric Crisis . In Washington , the Combined Food Board-which allocates supplies for the U.S. , Canada , and the United Kingdom-announced that it could not fill its wheat quota for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British had spent their substantial reserves . Now they had to cut the rations down to a near-starvation level of roughly 1,000 calories . <P> Despite McNarney 's optimistic estimate , the U.S. could hardly help without cutting its own 1,550 calories . The French zone was at the bottom of its flour bin . The Russians pointedly hinted that everything was all right in their zone ; actually , they might soon be facing serious shortage themselves . The food crisis spurred hopes of a zoneless four-power administration of Germany . <P> Fatigue of Defeat . Amid the worries over bread , political maneuvers continued . The Communists were still pressing for fusion with the Socialists despite a Socialist rank- &-file; revolt . But the mass of Germans paid far more attention to the food crisis than to politics . True , some began to display a mixture of old arrogance and new bitterness which might one day become the mental pattern for many of their fellow Germans . But most of them were too wearied by the extraordinary efforts of living to spend any effort on political thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logs from the woods , standing in queues for rations , digging among the rubble for a place to live . Some even scoured garbage dumps for food . Ever practical , the German Communist press captured readers with helpful household hints on how to stretch rations . Germany 's chief national objective , at least for the time being , was tomorrow 's breakfast .
