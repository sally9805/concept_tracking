SENTENCING OF THE COMMUNIST LEADERS * seemed curiously irrelevant alongside the historic fact of their conviction . In giving ten of the eleven defend  --  ants five years ' imprisonment and a $10,000 fine ( Thompson 's war record saved him two years ) Judge * Harold R. Medina went as far as he could go . He in  --  dicated that he would have meted out even heavier sentences if Congress last year had not halved the pen  --  alty for conspiracy , a fact which strangely came to light only in the week after the convictions . Coupled with denial of bail pending appeal , the severity of the sen  --  tences draws the line clearly . It has , in fact , an undeni  --  able logic . Either the Communists represent a " clear and present danger , " as Judge Medina believes , in which case the maximum sentence is justified ; or they represent no such danger , in which case the application of the Smith act was not warranted in the first place and the men are entitled to their freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger as a matter of law . Higher courts may well decide that this was not a matter of law but of fact , and as such to he determined by the jury . Or they may find , as a question of law , that the danger does not exist in a degree necessary to sustain the prosecution . Should they , on the other hand , uphold this application of the Smith act , as well as the law it self , then the actual sentences meted out to the eleven Communists will be of small importance in the light of * larger implications . For we shall then have moved into an era of fear in which prosecutors will try to root out dangers which the greatest of our jurists would never - have deemed either clear or present . We can only hope - **e that the judges of the higher courts are not easily fright * ened . The First Amendment hangs in the balance . RUMORS PERSIST THAT A BREAK IN THE steel strike is imminent . Much as we want to believe * that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimism either in the stubborn positions held by both sides or in their respective capacities to wage a long war of attrition . Philip Murray is known to be rigidly de  --  termined to get his men a system of non-contributory pensions . Having decided against pressing for a fourth round of wage increases , he can hardly confront his union with the prospect of a smaller pay envelope , even if the shrinkage is a form of savings . The big steel companies are equally adamant against establishing a precedent which would subject them to increasing security demands in the future . Unlike the coal miners , ' whose frequent stoppages have exhausted their credit and brought them to the verge of starvation , the steel workers are in a relatively solvent state . Except for a three-month stoppage in 1946 they have been working steadily for years , at top rates and with a considerable accumulation of overtime pay . To a far greater degree the steel companies , with their swollen war profits in  --  tact , can live off their fat . The country itself can no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks more without much harm , but should it continue be  --  yond the middle of November we will be faced with something very like a national emergency . In such a climate the chances for an equitable solution will ob  --  viously be less favorable than they are now . This present period is the time for Fairless and his colleagues on the one side and Murray on the other to come forward with alternative plans . Certain compromises have been suggested which both parties have an obligation to consider . Should they fail to do so , and quickly , the government should take over . This would at least create an atmosphere in which labor 's legitimate claim to social security would be fairly considered , free from the coercive pressures of a bitter strike . ONLY A REMARKABLY INEPT CONGRESS LIKE the Eightieth , or an unusually fruitful one , like the Seventy-third , can expect to figure as an entity in a political campaign . The Eighty-first , judging from its first session , is neither of these . In several analyses of its work appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session , more than nine months long and stretch  --  ing through one of Washington 's most uncomfortable summers , the Eighty-first served the country well in some fields , poorly in others . On the whole , its sins were not positive , like the Taft-Hartley act of its predecessor , - but rather sins of omission . It delivered none of the promised civil-liberties legislation , no public-health law , no modification of Taft-Hartley , and no federal aid to education . In its favor , on the other hand , are an in  --  creased minimum wage , a public-housing law , extension of rent control , increased storage facilities for crops , a start toward reorganization of the executive branch-ot the government , and a foreign policy that is at least coherent . Its investigating committees were considerably more responsible than those of the Eightieth Congress . The Un-American Activities Committee was hardly heard from , and while Senator Hickenlooper tried to prove David Lilienthal guilty of " incredible mismanage  --  ment " on the basis of no visible evidence , it was the Senator himself that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Senators Langer and Cain , acting for McCarran in the closing hours of the session , robbed the country of a chance to make up to the displaced persons of Europe for the grudging hand extended to them under the present shabby law . If civil liberties , permanent farm legislation , and Taft-Hartley haunt the Republicans in next year 's Congressional cam  --  paign , they will have only themselves and their Dixiecrat allies to thank . THE COMPROMISE FARM BILL WHICH WAS passed after months of Congressional wrangling has been hailed by Senator Scott Lucas , majority leader , as " permanent " legislation . We doubt that it will prove anything of the sort . Essentially the compromise is one that assures producers of the six basic crops  --  wheat , corn , cotton , tobacco , rice , and peanuts  --  of price support for 1950 at the present 90 per cent parity level . After that a flexible scale is to be introduced with supports ranging from 80 to 90 per cent in 1951 and from 75 ) to 90 per cent in later years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the farm bloc to main  --  tain the present rigid price floor . After all , the Hope-Aiken bill , now discarded , was also supposed to provide flexibility on , a permanent basis . A new twist in the compromise bill is the introduction of a " modernized " parity formula based on the relation between prices paid " ; by the farmers and prices received during the ten years , , ? preceding each harvest . Until 1954 , however , the SecTetary of Agriculture must use the old formula in setting support prices for basic crops in those cases where it gives producers a better deal . We can not believe that - manipulation of this kind will enhance the already# tarnished reputation of the parity theory . But in general this compromise bill seems thoroughly unsatisfactory . It is the fruit of trading between pressure groups rather than of a real effort to find means of combining security for the farmer with protection for the consurner . The whole farm problem needs to be reexamined in the light of technological developments in both industry , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign markets , our relief obligations , and so forth . As .. ? Congress has fallen down on the job , perhaps one of thee economic-research foundations will undertake a thor. , . ough investigation and formulate a genuine long-term , ' program . as John Collier pointed out in these pages on Septethher 17 , four other proposals designed to deprive the tribes of their property rights have already been drawn up by a few conscienceless Senators and Representatives . It is quite likely that an attempt will be made to rush this legislation through soon after Congress reopens , so as to forestall any public opposition . We warn our readers to watch for this development , and to raise a storm if they see it approaching . SPEAKING AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF the American Management Association , John E. O'Gara , vice-president and general manager of Macy 's , recently declared that the employment of Negroes in jobs util  --  izing their highest skills would add $6,000,000,000 to the buying power of the nation 's consumers . Employ  --  ment discrimination , he said , denies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market right here at home . . . . The damage comes directly home to roost in the markets of commerce and industry . " In addition , he stated , it cre  --  ates " a soft spot for subversive penetration " and forces the Negro to become an economic burden on the com  --  community . Although more fundamental arguments than those of economic self-interest and the prevention of " subversive penetration " could have been marshaled by Mr. O'Gara , it is good to hear an important business executive denounce discriminatory employment practices . . As Others See Us BY FREDA KIRCHWEY TALK to a State Department functionary and the chances are you will find him quite complacent about American foreign policy . Its apparent inconsis  --  tencies he will explain as necessary adaptations to changing conditions . He will regard as bolshevik non- sense the idea that our weight is on the side of social and political reaction and will draw items out of that same record of inconsistency to fortify his position . He will excuse our undeniable support of nationalists and former Nazis in Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things going again . So long as foreign relations and heavy industry are subject to inter-Allied supervision , what harm to have Hitler 's relicts. in charge of factories and some government agencies ? After all , those are the boys who have the " know-how " ? and production is what we need . And so the story goes : a story told by a nation so rich , so powerful , so much sought after that it can easily afford a few inconsistencies and mistakes ; can pass them off as of little account when it is occasionally forced to admit them . Viewed from Washington this is the way American policy looks , at /east to the people who help make it , Viewed from either Europe or the United Nations it looks so different that one wishes every bureau head , every agency official , every " desk " chief , could be forced to peel off his title and his departmental amour pro pre and go out into the world incognito , like some grand vizier of the Arabian Nights , to find out how others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  sions they grind out . But since this is a fantasy as remote as an Arabian Night 's tale itself , it is more sensible to hope that our policy-makers will at least read C. L. Sulzberger 's current series on American foreign policy in the New York Times . Here they will get the views of friendly , anti-Communist , informed Europeans , many of them officials themselves , transmitted by an expert reporter of foreign affairs who can not himself be ac  --  cused of " left deviations . " ? Mr. Sulzberger 's articles reveal the pzofound anxiety aroused in Europe by those inconsistencies and am ? - biguities our officials so easily shrug off . It would take too long to summarize his findings here . But it would not be going far afield to say that they add up to one inclusive generalization  --  not , however , expressed : American foreign policy is made up of a collection of short-range , changing , often contradictory and even self-defeating moves tied together by a single overriding consideration  --  to lick Russia in the political war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed , to lick Russia in the atomic war scheduled to follow . To this all other motives defer ; beside it such virtues as con  --  sistency , democracy , clarity , stability , even common sense are relatively unimportant . Viewed from the vantage point of the U. N. , the picture is much the same . Mr. del Vayo has described the reaction to State Department strategy there in a report this week and in two previous ones . Nothing could be more disconcerting to an American than the conversation in the delegates ' lounge after a session such as the one at which Yugoslavia was voted into the Security Council . Since the vote went against Russia , the natural assumption of an outsider would be that the majority genuinely favored Yugoslavia 's admission . To a person familiar with U. N. practice , that vote rep  --  resented a complicated mixture of partisanship , big-power pressure , and conviction  --  with the last last . Under all existing circumstances the choice of Yugo  --  slavia over Czechoslovakia was simply an anti-Soviet demonstration . It was engineered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lounge gave me the sense of rereading the Sulzberger series in a dif  --  ferent context . I talked to delegates of several countries and to three or four members of the U. N. permanent staff . Even those most sympathetic to Yugoslavia 's stand for independence believed that the main result of its election would be to injure whatever slight chance remained of reaching an agreement on atomic control or any other serious issue . It was not that these per  --  sons minimized the difficulty of finding common ground , or even a common language , with the Russians ; Vishin  --  sky 's sharp and hostile manner , from the start of the session , has hardly permitted any illusions on that score . It was rather the feeling that the United States , having already indicated a determination not to compromise , had gone beyond this to challenge Russia on its own ground , choosing the single most-inflamed issue as the test . A well-informed member of the secretariat told me he had reluctantly concluded that the United States had no wish at present to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simply an open announce  --  ment to that effect . Democratic Europeans and Asiatics do not expect much from Russia , but they look to America for leader  --  ship as well as aid . When this country presents the spectacle of a confused foreign policy , largely anti  --  democratic in its effect , coupled with an attitude of calculated hostility to Russia in the U. N. , they react with growing concern . The question is , how much does Washington know about this feeling or , knowing , how much does it care ? The Socialists Balk BY CLAUDE BOURDET Paris , October 24 ( by radio ) THE present government crisis is perhaps a landmark in French post-war history . Since the liberation , the political and economic power of the left parties and working-class forces has steadily declined and that of groups representing the former ruling class has in  --  creased . At the time of the liberation a united front of the workers and a large part of the middle class under the leadership of De Gaulle created the social basis for progressive democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially since many of them had been implicated in collaboration with the Germans . But the left-wing majority soon cracked for a number of reasons . One was the link of the Com  --  munists with Russia and the brutal tactics used by that party against its rivals . Then the natural leader of this majority , General de Gaulle  --  by nature a traditionalist ? refused to play the part of a revolutionary leader . Instead , De Gaulle appeared as the protector of the old social status , breaking the spirit of the Resistance and throwing the masses back into the arms of the Commu  --  nist Party . A third reason was that the Christian Demo  --  cratic M. R. P. was hampered by church and reactionary followers . Finally , the Socialist Party , which had already lost close contact with the working class , had not enough enterprise to reassume the leadership .
