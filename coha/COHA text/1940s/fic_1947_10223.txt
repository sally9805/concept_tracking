the center of their interest . When he began to speak , their heads leaned forward to catch what he was saying in a low voice , and when he finished , their heads went back in laughter . It was a rather extravagant , histrionic laughter which , with its slapping of thighs or of bar , was intended to demonstrate that the laugher was laughing . But when they laughed the three men were together among themselves , apart from Duck . They responded as he wanted them to , but they remained superior to him . It was as if he were imparting to them some wisdom and wit whose value they recognized , although they scorned him for having it . Duck was drunk . He stood facing the bar , erect , a man whose sense of worldly ease , coming from what he has drunk and from old images of himself , can be taken from him at any moment . He continually made a little cocking gesture of his head , a small sidewisetoss , and he raised his eyebrows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and disdains or is indifferent to what he sees . Mr. Folger ordered beer and Laskell had the same . Mr. Folger raised his glass and bowed over it before drinking . There was a large stag 's head over the back of the bar and Mr. Folger 's bow seemed to offer courtesy to the stag , but Laskell returned it . He liked Mr. Folger very much . One of the men at the other end of the bar leaned over Duck 's shoulder to disturb the conscious isolation in which he stood . The man said something in an inaudible voice and gave Duck a poke . Duck looked modest and even shy . But at last , with a shrug , he consented . The three men drew around him . He must have been telling his story well , for the men drew nearer and nearer to catch his words . When they were as close as he wanted them to be , his voice became more distinct . This made it seem rather foolish of them to be crowding up to a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the words , " And her maybe three months gone , maybe more . . . " Then he heard , " . . . lays one hand on her belly . . . " At this point Duck stopped his narrative and made a demonstration . He protruded his belly and laid one hand hard upon it . He went on , " And then he lays one hand on her tit . " And Duck clapped himself avidly on the breast . He held both hands inpIOIplace , acting both the man and the woman . He stood there in demonstration , lifting each hand and clapping it down again on himself to show how it had been done . " Wahoo ! " cried one of his listeners in conventional but intense enthusiasm . " Yowee ! " said another . Duck surveyed his effect calmly . " And then . . . " Duck said and his voice dropped again , the heads were bent to him . Then his voice lifted in a calfish bellow of passion , " Nancy darling , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Arthur , please ! ' " He surveyed his success and said , " And then , what do you think he does ? " His voice dropped again and when he finishedthere was the extreme explicit laughter . But as the men laughed they had an understanding among themselves from which the performer was excluded . The informationabout life which they had received was interesting and valuableto them , but they looked down on the man who had such information to impart . Mr. Folger was not looking at the group , nor was he looking at Laskell . He looked into his glass of beer , criticizing it . He was uncomfortablethat Laskell 's friends were being discussed . Duck snapped his fingers three times in the direction of the man in charge of the bar , who drew four glasses of beer and took them down to the group . Mr. Folger did all that could be done at the moment . At least he did all that could be done by the method of diplomacy . He directedhis gaze and voice to the shabby head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , " he said to the stag , " there is a kind of man , even his own wife is n't sacred to him . Even his own wife . " It tactfully opened such depths of Duck that the present incidentcould almost be lost in them . Just then Duck turned , as if to take cognizance of the possibility that there might be someone else at the bar . But it was not Mr. Folger and Laskell that his eyes rested on . His wife had come in . Emily Caldwell had paused for a moment just over the threshold . It was the only place in the long narrow room which the sunlightreached and she seemed very conspicuous with her yellow print dress and her bright coronet of braids . Duck stood and low-pIO2 ered at her , waiting for her to come closer . She did not hurry . Nor did she ignore Mr. Folger and Laskell . " How do you do , Mr. Folger , Mr. Laskell , " she said , giving them for an instant all her attention . She walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her approaching , knowing what she had come for . It was a bad situation for any woman to be in , a wife coming to take a man away from his companions for his own good . Emily nodded to Duck 's friends , casually and pleasantly . And as they nodded back , their nods carried them into a subtle shift of position that made their group stand separate from Duck . Emily said , " Come , dear , we must go . " " In a minute , in a minute , " Duck said . He made the point of dignity by not looking at her . He turned elaborately to the glass of beer on the bar . " I have a drink to finish . " But she was too quick for him , for she reached out and took up the glass of beer before his slowly moving hand could encompass it . " That 's easy , " she said . " If you do n't mind . " And she raised the glass and drank half of it . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends . And " See , I 've drunk it all , such a pig , " she said when she had drained the glass very competently . She held up the glass for them all to see . She had compounded whatever sin the three companions thought they were committing , she was not judging them or her husband . She said to Duck , " We must go or we 'll be late . " What appointment she and her husband could be presumed to have and what force punctuality could have in their casual country life did not seem to matter to her . Business or social engagementscalled them away , so sorry to have to run off  --  her manner insisted that this was the case . She involved the whole situation in this social manner ; it was foolish but it hid from sight the wife snatching her husband from a bar under the very eyes of his friends . The men might snicker at her when she left but they could not regard her with cold hostility any more . Yet nothing she could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her , his face swollen with anger . At last he brought himself to speak . " Go ahead , " he said , looking at her intently , with a kind of scientific curiosity , holding his gaze upon her , his mouth pulledpI03back tight at the corners to show that he regarded her with a disgustedobjectivity . She turned and went . As she passed Mr. Folger and Laskell she nodded good-by . She did not look defeated . And she had no reason to , for Duck , when he had picked up his glass , looked at its emptiness with profound irony , drained the few drops of foam left in it , and carefully set it on the bar , followed Emily out of the tavernwithout a word to his friends . Mr. Folger addressed himself to the stag . " Not an easy life , " he said . " I would n't say she had an easy life at all . " Laskell liked Mr. Folger so much that he ventured a suggestion . " Do you think we ought to give them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's antlers was broken off and Mr. Folgerseemed to be commenting adversely on this defect as he said , " I guess not . " And Laskell liked him well enough to believe that Mr. Folger was not only expressing a disinclination from implicating himself , and the car consecrated to Miss Walker , with the Caldwells , but also , perhaps , a kind of delicacy , a feeling that the Caldwells had best now be alone . On the drive home they passed the Croom car driven very slowly by Emily Caldwell with Duck asleep in the seat beside her . If the incident made any changes in Laskell 's view of things , it was not in his view of Duck  --  his opinion of Duck could only remainwhat it had been before  --  but in the way he saw Nancy . He sat with her the next morning as she knelt before the flower border at the north side of the house . She was pulling weeds and looseningthe earth around the asters . Her pregnancy seemed more apparenttoday . Perhaps that was because it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may have been because Nancy seemed suddenly so very young to be a mother  --  so young to be so very much involved in life . She was involved up to her ears , with a child here and a child to come , with husband and house , with her own trimness and efficiency , and then with her full , generous hope that all she had and all she was could be what the world had  --  she was too modest to hope that the world could be as she was , but Laskell could hope it for her . And what she didpI04 hope for she was passionately sure would come , for she knew that most people had her own clarity of spirit . It was a very large faith , a very large involvement with life . But now Laskell saw her as he had never seen her before  --  in an aura of self-deception . It was that which made her so very girlish today , for after all she was twenty-six . She was like some thoughtfuladolescent who utters a starry sentiment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good but mistaken parent or teacher ; she sets her chin sternly against any knowledge of the world in which she will have to make her sentiment prevail , and the sternness of her self-deceiving pose of maturity makes her seem even younger than she really is . For the desire to refuse knowledge of the evil and hardness of the world can often shine in a face like a glow of youth . What Nancy talked about quite confirmed Laskell 's new sense of her . She put down her hand rake , pushed back her hair , and turned on her knees to him . " John , " she said seriously , " I want to ask you something . " Her youthfulness appeared here in her intense seriousness and he could not help teasing her . " Please feel , Mrs. Groom , that you can speak freely to me . " " No , " she said quietly . " I 'm serious . John , tell me  --  do you think we could have a rock-garden next year ? Would it look silly ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For there was a pile of the large stones that Nancy had collected from her flower beds . " Seriously , John . Would it look silly ? " " No more silly than any other kind of garden . " " You know , " said Nancy , " there are certain kinds of rock flowers that I like better than any other flowers in the world . But I do n't know . Maybe it would look silly . " " What are you talking about ? " said Laskell . " Silly in what way ? If you like them . " " I mean inappropriate . I 've always associated rock-gardens with suburban homes , even estates . And this is such a simple community . It might look funny . You know  --  affected . " She was quite shy about it . " Oh , for Pete 's sake , Nancy ! " But Nancy seemed scarcely to notice the interruption . " I 'd likep105to think of this as really our home  --  our place . I love the people here , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even small things that one does can make them uncomfortable . " Then she added , " As it were , " as if there would have been a disloyaltyin her meaning it too literally . " In that case , " Laskell said , " I should think you 'd have to give up thinking of this as really your home . " " I wo n't ! " she said . The quick refusal , the stubbornly outthrust chin , made Laskell smile . She really was like an independent child . But he thought of the scene in the tavern and Nancy 's opinion of Duck and knew that an independent child was not enough to be , not as the world was . " Did you ever have a rock-garden ? " he said . " When I was a little girl we had one . My mother was mad about it , spent hours on it . " The memory of that seemed to reassure her , as if it told her that she was not asserting a whim but affirming a tradition . She sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I drove to town with Mr. Folger yesterday after-noon . " " Did you ? Is n't he the finest person ? " " I like him very much . We stopped and had a glass of beer together . I saw your Duck there . " " My Duck ? Yes , he borrowed the car yesterday . " " He was drunk . " Nancy sighed elaborately . " He just ca n't drink , " she said . Her tone was elegiac , and like any elegy it mourned the hard fact , acceptedit , and was reconciled to it in the end . Laskell , who suspected that he had already said too much , would not have gone on if Nancy had not explained , " It 's his weakness , but there 's somethingwonderful about him , a quality of life , a kind of unexpressed affirmation . " He stared at her . " You really think so ? " And she , catching the real question in his tone , stared back at him hostilely . " You know , John , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think you have a prejudice against Duck . " She held up a hand to stop any disclaimer he might make . " Yes , I think you have . You 've never talked to him and yet whenever his name comesp106up , it seems to me that there is a kind of antagonism in you . I know you well enough , John , to know what you 're feeling , even when you do n't say anything . " It was likely to be true . Still , it was surprisingto him that she should have been able to read his feelings about Duck . " He 's a very important kind of person , " Nancy continued , " even if you do n't consider him just personally . It 's not like you to judge a person without knowing him . " There was nothing he could say . He could scarcely mention the single concrete fact he might use in evidence against Duck  --  he could not tell Nancy about Duck in the tavern . And because the evidence could not be used , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge a man by an incident , however distasteful it seemed . Best to surrender his stand , and maybe , indeed , there was no need for a stand at all . All he said was , " Perhaps you 're right . " " I know I 'm right , John , " Nancy said gently . She was willing to let the subject drop . For a while Nancy gardened in silence . Then she asked , " Are you fond of flowers , John ? " It was one of those things that one friend can say to another only under such country circumstances  --  while one of them worked and the other idled , in the open air , with plenty of time ahead , with no particular concentration on each other , not wanting any special answer or any answer at all . It came like a greeting and suggested how valuable life could be without struggle , or ideas , or commitments . A hundred , a thousand other questions could be asked that would have the effect of making two people as simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nancy were . It seemed to him that such conversations could go on forever . " Are you fond of flowers ? " " Do you like dogs ? " " Do you like whisky ? " " Do you like to read poetry ? " And there were untold numbers of answers . " Yes , I am quite fond of flowers and my favoritesare peonies but I also have a great feeling for delphinium . " " Yes , I like dogs . If I had one , I would have an Irish terrier . I 've also thought of dachshunds . Schnauzers I do n't like , nor boxers , nor Scotch terriers . But I 'd only have a dog if I lived in the country . " It could go on forever . It would have been better if , lying there on the ground , with hispI07hands clasped under his head , he had just stayed with one of those imbecile answers to Nancy 's question , one of those responses that gently said no more than that he was alive and she was alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . But instead he said , " It 's funny you ask . Because I never gave it a thought until I got sick . But while I was sick I seem to have got myself enormouslyinvolved with a flower . It was a rose . " " Oh , roses ! " said Nancy , wrinkling her nose . " Queen of the flowers . " " I could look at it for hours . I never knew what it meant when people talked about contemplation . But that 's what I did with that rose  --  I contemplated it . My nurse Paine said  --  " " I liked that Paine . Not the other nurse , not at all . But Paine I liked a great deal . " " She liked you too . She had a great admiration for both of you , you and Arthur . After I had been looking at that flower for days , she said , You seem to be having quite a love affair with that flower . ' And I suppose she was right . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Ferdinand , " Nancy said . His eyes had been closed against the sun . Now he opened them and looked straight up into the sky . It was very blue , and the longer he looked the higher it became . He remembered that in Latin there was only one word for high and for deep . The Romans spoke of the heights of the sea and the depths of the sky . He tried to let this oddly remembered fact fill the whole of his mind . But it would not fill the whole of his mind . It would not displace the strange , contracting pain he experienced at Nancy 's calling him by the name of the hero of that children 's book so popular with adults , about a young bull who liked to look at flowers and did not charge around like other bulls . When Ferdinand was sent to the bull-ring in Madrid , instead of resisting the matador and being hurt and killed , he sat down in the middle of the ring and enjoyed the flowers in the hair of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence he was disgraced but safe , and he was sent back to the ranch where he spent the rest of his life looking at flowers . A good many political feelings became attached to the story and people chuckled over it as if it were a piece of folkwisdom.  |p108Laskell  said , " Why do people like that story so much ? " He was still looking deep into the sky . " I do . I ca n't wait for Micky to get old enough so I can read it to him . " " Why do people like it ? Why do you like it ? " " For its moral , I suppose . " " They seem to like the idea of a bull going against the nature of bulls . " " Oh , no , that 's not it . The moral is that if people just refused to fight there would be no more wars . I suppose Ferdinand is just simple human reason , the reason of simple human people refusing to cooperate in their own exploitation and slaughter . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulls were . He lived to enjoy himself . " " Is that something ? " " Well , is n't it ? " " If the Loyalists were to act like Ferdinand ? " " That 's different . They 're fighting for something . " When Laskell spoke again , he spoke carefully . " When you said just now that I was quite a Ferdinand , you were teasing me , were n't you , not praising me ? " " Why , John ! " Nancy said . " Why , John Laskell ! " " No , I 'm not being sensitive . But really , it 's serious . You say you admire Ferdinand . But when you want to make fun of me , you say I am quite a Ferdinand . That puzzles me . It 's like the people who give parties for Spain  --  they 're the same people who admire the sissy bull . " Nancy was ruffling . " We have to make a distinction between immediate necessity and ultimate hope , do n't we ? We have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nature . " " I 'm not so sure . " But the conversation was becoming very heavilycharged and Laskell felt tired . " I suppose , " he said , " the bull who smells flowers and does n't charge when he 's attacked is the modern version of the lion who lies down with the lamb . " Nancy made a gesture to show that she did n't quite accept the parallel . He had not yet been able to look at Nancy , he was still looking , deep into the sky . " I think the old version was nicer . The lion wasp109still a lion and whenever he lay down with the lamb it was a fresh surprise . I do n't think we really admire Ferdinand , Nancy . I think we really despise him . What bothers me is that we praise somethingwe really despise . " And then he said , " I wonder if we 're not developing a strange ambivalent kind of culture , people like us . I wonder if we do n't rather like the idea of safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emasculation . " He had successfully carried it away from himself . And the suddenpain he had felt when Nancy called him Ferdinand had sunk almost to nothing . He had talked very fast and he had headed , as the occasion seemed to require , toward generalities . He had talked with half his mind , loosely , and he was rather startled by the place he had come to . He had never before generalized in this adverse way about the people he lived with , the decent people , the people of good will . It frightened him a little . He wondered what Nancy would say . Nancy had picked up her hand rake and was thoughtfully scratching the grass with it . For the life of him Laskell could not think of anything to say that would carry their conversation in a new direction . He felt that he had said something for which Nancy might not easily forgive him . But Nancy chose not to deal with his generalization at all . She said , " I did n't mean anything when I said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anybody would have said it to a person who spoke about being devoted to a flower . Really , John , I was n't making fun of you ! " And then she said with the rights of their friendship , " And since when , John Laskell , have you got so sensitive ? Just you stop it . You 're acting spoiled  --  your illness has made you sensitive and spoiled . I wo n't have it from you . " She had justice on her side , and the right to command him . He sat up , grateful for the opportunity she gave him to accept defeat  --  and defeat on the basis of friendship . And then briskly looking for something to talk about , he thought to take out his wallet and he dug with his fingers into one of its pockets . Nancy was watching him with interest . There was really a good deal of the child about her and he had diverted her by making her curious about what he had to show . He drew out the snapshot that Maxim hadpIIO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mad visit . Maxim had laid it on the table between them with the explanation that he had come across it while destroying some papers . " Who is it ? " said Nancy as she reached out to take what she saw was a snapshot . She looked at it . " John , have you gone and  --  " Then understanding broke upon her , perhaps from the fashion of the dress in the photograph , and she said , " This is  --  Is this  --  ? " " Yes , " Laskell said . " It 's Elizabeth . I do n't think you 've ever seen a picture of her . " " No , never . I never have . " She was examining the photograph carefully . She looked at it longer than she need have , even for a thorough examination . Then she seemed able to speak . She turned her gaze to Laskell . Her eyes were very wide and her face had paled beneath her tan . She was struggling with some emotion , she was trying to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had done . He was horrified at himself . When Maxim had given him the photograph Laskell had understoodthe part it played in Maxim 's plan of manipulation . He had known that it had been intended by Maxim to flood his mind with emotions that would make him the more accessible to Maxim'srequest for help . Specifically it was intended to remind him that people really did die . Elizabeth Fuess died , Maxim was saying , in the midst of our safe life  --  if you doubt that I too can die , let this picture remind you of her and convince you about me . To show a snapshot of Elizabeth to Nancy at any time would be momentous . But to show it at this instant , with disagreement , and that particular disagreement , just behind them  --  no , his mind had not been innocent when he had done that . Had he not , in some way , wanted to tell her just what Maxim had wanted to tell him , that people really do die ? And if he had , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel lesson , what deep alienation had sprung up between them ? " She is  --  She was  --  " Nancy struggled with the tense . " There is something very attractive  --  Gifford Maxim once told me about her . He said she was very attractive  --  very pretty . " " Never pretty . " Nancy looked at him to see what the denial meant . " Beautiful ? " " Sometimes . Not always . Seldom , really . "  | " Gill seemed to admire her a good deal . But when I tried to get him to say why , he said he could n't explain . And the things he said about her did n't seem to be the kind of things that would make him admire a woman . He said she never worked . " " He liked her very much . " " Did she like him ? " " Moderately . " " Only moderately ? " " She never quite liked his relation to his ideas . It was n't the ideas themselves so much , but his relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said Nancy . " I do n't quite know what that means . " She said it without much inflection , not quarrelsomely , but it put her in opposition to Elizabeth 's expressed opinion . Laskell felt that there was no reason to come to the defense of Elizabeth 's opinion . It had been all too well confirmed by the facts . Elizabeth had been remarkably right about Maxim . Laskell remembered the indifferentinterest with which she had listened that time to his own enthusiasticdescription of Maxim 's powers , the little shrug of her shoulders to depreciate not his estimate but hers as she said , " I somehow do n't quite like his relation to his ideas . " Nancy gave back the snapshot . " You know , " she said , " when you showed me the picture , I first thought it was a girl you had met and got interested in . John , would you let me say something ? It 's something I thought of while you were ill . I thought of you lying there with no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , Oh , why does n't John get married ? ' And now when I think of you living in the past  --  Somehow I never realized how much you must do that . I mean , like carrying that picture in your wallet . It is n't like you , John . It 's not like you to be so morbid . Life makes demands on us  --  We have responsibilities , to others and ourselves . I 'm younger than you , but maybe I have the right to remind you of that . You 're young and attractive and comfortable . John , do you mind my talking like this to you ? " He was putting the picture back into the wallet and the wallet back into his hip-pocket . He buttoned the pocket . " How could I mind ? " he said . " Are you sure ? Do you think I 'm right ? "  | He did not mind  --  he had no mind to mind with . He wished that Nancy were not looking into his face to see how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look into and lose himself in as when Nancy had said he was quite a Ferdinand . " Are you sure you do n't mind ? Do you think I 'm right ? " Nancy said again . She surely could not have meant anything  --  was it not what at some time every married woman says to every unmarried young man she is fond of ?  --  but she was terribly worried that her ordinary little sermon had hurt him , she was rather miserably looking into his face for evidences of hurt . And then he knew that he had hurt Nancy and that she had in some way meant to hurt him . Ferdinandand marriage were her answers to his mention of illness and death . " Nancy , " he said with sudden clarity . " Nancy , why are you so scared of it ? " " Of what ? " she said as if she would just like to hear him name the thing she was scared of . " Of death . Why are you so scared of the word being said ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had gone white . " I have only to say the word and you turn the subject . I have not been able to say anything to you about my being ill  --  you and Arthur did everything for me while I was actually sick , but you jib like a pair of colts whenever I try to speak about it . You wo n't have me say a word about it  --  either of you . I have only to show you a picture of Elizabeth and because she died you are thrown into confusion . " He did not go on to say , " And you respond by attacking as subtly and cruelly as possible . " But he did say , " You talk about morbidity and living in the past  --  as if you thought that death was politically reactionary . " It was a great comfort to him to have said it at last . And it was some comfort to Nancy that he had uttered so many words , some of which she could reply to . She looked very stricken at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was a generous girl , for her voice as she spoke had clearly the intention of defending not herself but their friendship . " John , " she said , " you misunderstood . I was n't criticizing you . I did n't mean to make you angry . "  |p113The  appeal was not to be resisted and Laskell put out his hand and rumpled her bright , sunburned hair . He was enormously grateful that at that moment Micky charged toward them over the lawn , followed by the watchful Eunice . Micky saw Laskell and stopped . He looked at Laskell with challenge in his eyes , and when Laskell , as slowly as possible and with large exaggerated movements , began to get into motion , showing that he accepted the challenge , Micky veered off and ran . They had developed a kind of tag in which , if Laskell ran slowly enough and Micky ran fast enough , the chase could go on for quite a way . At last the pursuit ended and Laskell brought Micky back on his shoulder . Eunice said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laskell took the child from his shoulder and held him up for inspection . " Filthy ! " He grinned . Nancy said to Eunice very kindly , " A little boy has a right to get dirty . Do n't you think so , Eunice ? " Eunice acknowledged the rule but did not answer the question . Laskell put the boy down . The run had given Nancy a chance to recover herself and her face was almost cleared of its unhappiness . " I 'm going to lunch now , Nancy , " he said . " I 'll be coming in after dinner this evening . I have some news for you . It 's about GiffordMaxim . I should have told you before but at least I want to tell you now . " " News ? About Gifford Maxim ? Tell me now  --  tell me now , John , " Nancy said . " No , not now . I want Arthur to hear it too . " " But I 'll tell Arthur if it 's interesting . " " It 's interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important . And more disturbing . It 's a long story , I 'll tell you tonight . " She looked at him , surprised by the gravity of his tone . She did not protest the postponement . She said , " Is it something bad ? " " I 'll tell you tonight . "  |p114WALKING  back to the Folgers ' for lunch , Laskell felt the great relief of having made up his mind to tell the Crooms about Gifford Maxim . In the natural course of things he should long ago have told them . But he had not been following the naturalcourse of things . He had been trying to punish the Crooms . He had to see that and he felt the better for seeing it . It was hot and still on the road . The light , dry dust rose with each step he took . There was not a breath stirring and the unmovingleaves of the trees were dusty . At a rise in the hill he stopped to look around him . He could see a fairish distance in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape before him , the quiet farms in the foreground , the little hills behind , he found it very difficult to remember his apartment and what had gone on in it the day before he had left to come here . Those city emotions seemed so far off in time , so uncertain in texture . But Laskell forced his mind to reconstitute the event detail by detail , for his account to the Grooms must be clear and circumstantial . He remembered that he and Paine had been engaged in that pointless squabble about his fishing things when Maxim rang . And he remembered how Maxim , when he entered , was taken aback by the sight of Paine , although she must have explained her presence and function when he had telephoned . But it was Maxim'sbusiness not to be dull about the unexpected . It was also his business to know how to deal with misfortune of every kind . He was , as it were , a technician in human suffering . His tone was full of accurate , firm sympathy . He said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The presence of Paine in her white uniform was a help to Las/kell . It made it easier to bear the brunt of that great moral authority of Maxim 's . Certain things were clear between Laskell and Maxim . It was established that Laskell accepted Maxim 's extreme commitment to the future . It was understood between them that Laskell did not accept all of Maxim 's ideas . At the same time , Laskell did not oppose Maxim 's ideas . One could not oppose them without being illiberal , even reactionary . One would have to have something betterto offer and Laskell had nothing better . He could not even imagine what the better ideas would be . He sometimes regretted this but , after all , although he was an intelligent man , he could scarcely set up as an original thinker . He was left very much exposed , not to Maxim 's arguments , for Maxim seldom argued , but to Maxim 's inner authority . This Laskell did not regret . Maxim never formulated an accusation in words , yet he did make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . This accusation was unlikeany other  --  it was benign . It brought the guilt into the open , the guilt of being what one was , the guilt one shared with others of one 's comfortable class . There was a kind of relief in admitting the guilt to this huge dedicated man . After the first surprise , the first shying away from Maxim 's great moral force , Laskell was not at all sorry to see his friend . In fact he was glad . He felt ready to greet the approach of life in its grimy tangibility and high hope . Maxim looked at the packed bags and said , " And now you 're goingto the country . That 's good . It will do you good , you need it . " His voice was full of the direct sympathy he knew how to give . It was conscious but not insincere . Laskell had seen Maxim give his sympathy to overworked waiters or soda-clerks . Some of them responded happily to this gentling of their strained nerves . But some became restive under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from this big man with the scarred face and the shabby clothes and the voice that was of another class than theirs . " When are you leaving ?  --  right now ? " It seemed to Laskell that there was a shadow of apprehension on Maxim 's face . " No , I leave tomorrow morning . " And there was no doubt that with this answer the shadow passed.  |p116Laskell  remembered that Maxim , on his last visit , had asked him to dismiss the Negro cleaning-woman . Now perhaps something should be done about Paine . For Maxim surely had another requestto make . And all Laskell 's unhappiness at that refusal of his came back to him now and with it the hope that this time Maxim would ask something of him to which he would not have to say no . He did not know how to get rid of Paine so that Maxim could make his request . And he ought to introduce Maxim to Paine , but he did not know by what name to introduce him . He was helped out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " My name is Maxim  --  Gifford Maxim , " and put out his large hand . " How do you do , Mr. Maxwell , " said Paine . " My name is Paine . Is n't that a dreadful name for a nurse ? " " Not Maxwell  --  Maxim , like the silencer , " Maxim said . " Yes , it 's a dreadful name for a nurse and I bet you live up to it too . " This was wonderfully in Paine 's line and she grinned back at Maxim . She saw , as her remarks to Laskell later showed , right beyond the shabby clothes , the dirty shirt and the heavy scarred face , to the pride of family that lay so incongruously beneath them , saw the courage and the violence , the lack of regard for ordinary notions , and she said to Laskell that evening , " That friend of yours , that Mr. Maxim , is a real gentleman . " Laskell snapped , " Oh , yes  --  a proper gentleman , " furious at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was not really of the class that would say " a proper gentleman . " " Yes , he is indeed , " she said and brooded with pleasure on her intuition of Maxim 's aristocracy . But Laskell by then had had his fill of Maxim and rather more than his fill , and would not discuss him with Paine . If Maxim was using his real name and even insisting that Paine get it right , perhaps there was no need to get rid of the nurse . Yet to be safe , Laskell said , " Paine , do you think we could all have some ice cream ? You 'll have some , Giff ? " " Yes , thanks , I 'd like it , " Maxim said . " But why do n't I go for it ? It 's terribly hot . " " Just as hot for you as for me ! " Paine said , peppery and friendly . " You stay here and talk to your friend . " And she added darkly , " He needs talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishesp117her charge by turning her regard to the visiting little boy , the good little boy who really knows how to behave . " It 's terribly hot , " said Maxim . " Probably the hottest July thirteenthon record . It is the thirteenth , is n't it ? " " No , the twelfth , " said Laskell . Maxim said to Paine , " Is it ? " His manner with her was very bold and gentle . He was " establishing contact " as Laskell had seen him do . He was succeeding very well with Paine . " I rather think you 're right , " said Paine . " The thirteenth . " , Laskell bitterly remembered how often the date had been mentionedbetween Paine and himself , for he was to leave tomorrow , the thirteenth . " Have you a calendar or a newspaper ? " Maxim said . " It 's the twelfth , " said Laskell irritably . Paine found a newspaper in the wastepaper basket . " It 's the twelfth , " she said , granting the point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the thirteenth as sure as my name is Gifford Maxim . " But Paine faced up manfully to the error they had shared . " No , the twelfth , " she said . Laskell felt a wave of boredom sweep over him as the date was settled and this dry little flirtation came to an end . Maxim had the look of a man who has accomplished something . Paine went out for the ice cream . Laskell was left alone with Maxim , who took off his jacket . His shirt was nearly transparent with sweat . He sat down in the armchair opposite Laskell 's . He took a cigarette from the box on the low table between them , lit it and drew in the smoke deeply , as far as smoke would go . Then slowly , carefully , analytically , he let it out . Laskell laid his head back on his chair . He was suddenly very tired . The pressure from Maxim was enormous . He wished that Maxim would make his requestwithout further preliminaries . He admitted that the indictmentwas a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxim was and also , perhaps , by what he kept secret . What Maxim was , was centered in that great dreadful scar on his cheek , down from the cheekbone to the chin . It was said to have been made by a glancing blow from the steel shoe of a policeman 's horse , rearing in a crowd as such horses are taught to do.  | Maxim looked mildly and patiently at Laskell . Then he looked over Laskell 's head and beyond it and asked his question . " Are you still a friend of Kermit Simpson ? " he said . And not until the questionhad been asked did he let his patient gaze come to rest again on Laskell 's face . It was strange  --  in these infrequent meetings between Laskell and Maxim there was always a period of questioning . Maxim seemed to be investigating certain lines of communication . Usually the questions were about people he no longer saw . He seemed to want to understand the connections that existed between them . He seemed , too , to want to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Maxim asked his questions , he used a slow , gentle , but very direct manner . He might have been conducting an inquiry of a high official sort . Laskell never felt that he was a criminal in the inquiry , but a respectable and important person consenting to give information , although there was indeed the chance that one of his answers might strip him of respectability and importance , much to Maxim 's regret . Laskell found that he answered Maxim 's questions as briefly as possible . He acknowledged the authority of the interrogation by guarding himself against it . At the same time , he tried to be very direct and truthful and was conscious of his directness and truthfulness , as if he were contending with the impulse to lie to Maxim . " Are you close to Simpson ? " " What do you mean by close ? " Maxim looked tolerantly at Laskell , acknowledging Laskell 's privilege to attempt evasion . He said patiently , " Do you have any influence over him ? " " Influence ? Why should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the few really rich men Laskell knew well . And although he had answered , " Why should I have influence over him ? " uttering the word influence with irony , he knew , now that he was in Maxim 's orbit , that it was a natural question to ask about someone 's relation to a very rich man : Do you have influence over him ? It was especially the question to be asked if the rich man was , like Kermit Simpson , politically idealisticand the owner and editor of a rather sad liberal monthly.  | " You see him , do n't you ? " Maxim asked , still most patient . " On the whole , you see a good deal of him ? " He was making a new start , back of the question Laskell preferred not to understand . " Yes , " said Laskell in a neutral voice , yielding the point but not giving much weight to it . And then the impulse to be entirely honestwhen Maxim questioned him made him say , " I spend week ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " Maxim received this statement with a look of kind approval . He turned his head to see the creel and rod which lay together near the suitcases . His manner was more relaxed , was very relaxed , as he drew his conclusion . " Then you 're going up to stay with him ? " " No , " said Laskell . " I 'm going up to Arthur Groom 's place . " And he decided to ask a question himself . " Have you seen the Grooms lately ? " Maxim gave no sign of having heard . " Could you get Kermit to take someone on ? " Maxim said . " On The New Era , I mean . " The New Era was the monthly magazine that Kermit Simpson ran on what he called Jeffersonian principles . " What do you mean , take someone on ? " " Give him a job . " " It would n't be a very good job . " Maxim ignored this and Laskell felt foolish for having said it . " Could you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I 've sent him friends who wanted to write  --  reviewbooks and that sort of thing . But of course an actual job is different . " Maxim nodded understandingly . In these questionings there was always a moment when Laskell felt that he was hedging and knew that Maxim was aware of it . Maxim never accused him of hedging . He seemed to expect reservations and always let them be made , never fighting them . He really had no need to fight , becauseLaskell always felt how shameful the reservations were . For to Laskell , Maxim was never quite alone . Laskell saw him flanked by two great watching figures . They were abstracted and motionless , having the air that figures in a mural have , of being justified in the exclusive contemplation of their own existence and what they stand for . On one side of Maxim stood the figure of the huge , sad , stern morality of all the suffering and exploited men in the world , all of them , without distinction of color or creed . On thepI20 other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fierce , indomitable . Both figures appeared to Laskell 's mind as male but sexless . The face of the one was old and tragic , the face of the other was young and proud . Yet both had that brooding blind look that is given by men to the abstractions they admire , in the belief that a lack of personal being is the mark of all great and admirable things . Behind Maxim and his two great flanking figures were the infinite dim vistas of History , which was not the past but the future . The vistas were corridors , and every answer made by Laskell , every evasion or reservation he might attempt , was listened to not only by Maxim himself , whose great scar made its sardonic comment on everything that was false , but was listened to also by the two great figures of suffering and power , and every answer reechoeddown the everlasting corridors of History , identified as the answer of the one poor meaningless unit , John Laskell , who was so concerned with his own being , his own poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then , " Maxim said , summing up conclusively , " Kermit has listened to your advice before . " As Maxim put it this way , so minimally , Laskell knew that Maxim understood how much influence he really did have over Kermit Simpson . Kermit was a man of sudden attachments and enthusiasms , and more than one person had reported to Laskell the admiration for his good sense that Kermit had expressed . Like many rich men , Kermit Simpson was always looking for a wise friend , a perfectly disinterested adviser . This year Laskell was the friend . Maxim , with his gift for picking up information , surely knew this . " Good , " Maxim said . " That 's what I wanted to be sure of . If I asked you to recommend someone for a job , would you do it ? And even put a little pressure on Kermit to get him to say yes ? " Here , then , was Maxim 's request . It was of course political , and if it was political , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Laskell , and the corridors of History were ready to reverberate with his answer  --  for they have great acoustical properties , these corridors , and echo every word , no matter how softly spoken . For some reason Maxim wished to place one of his people on Kermit Simpson 's Era . ThepI2INew Era was a chucklehead of a magazine and the only thing that might give it any value at all , any place in the long historical vista , was for it to be used by Maxim . Yet Laskell had always had a kind of affection for The New Era , exactly because it was so chuckleheaded , so simple and gentle in its liberal and humanitarian faith . If Maxim wanted to place one of his people on The New Era , it could be only with the idea of influencing the policy of the magazine , perhaps of getting control of it . Once that happened , it would of course no longer be really The New Era at all . But this did not seem to matter so very much  --  under Maxim 's eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It appeared to him only as the means of a small favor that he could do for Maxim . " You mean , " Laskell said , " that you want a job on The New Era for one of your people ? " And then , because he had made up his mind to try to do what Maxim wanted , he felt that he had the right to ask , " What do you want that for ? " Maxim made a strange answer . " I have no people , " he said . There was sternness in his voice and his eyes narrowed . But it was a foolish evasion and it weakened him with Laskell . To a frank and open Maxim much could be given easily , The New Era among other things . But an evasive Maxim was very different . It was often necessary to hide one 's Party affiliation , but Maxim 's had always been open and known . It was one of the important things about him . He did have " people "  --  he both gave orders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no people . " And before Laskell could challenge the false statement , Maxim said , " And you are jumping to conclusions . Would you recommend me for a job ? " " You ! " Slowly Maxim took another cigarette from the box and lit it . He inhaled the smoke as if searching out with it depths of his being that could be reached in no other way . He shook out the match and then blew the smoke out of his lungs in a long desperate exhalation . " Yes , " he said . " Me . " He got up slowly and went over to the luggage . He picked up the creel by its strap and looked at it curiously as it dangled . Hep122turned to regard Laskell with a still , hooded , waiting amusement . Laskell understood this tactic of pacing the conversation slowly , all the pauses dictated by Maxim . It put things in Maxim 's hands . It was intended to give Laskell time to doubt and question himself . And Laskell had always submitted to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the tempo of events had the right to dictate the tempo of conversation . But now he did not submit to it . It even made him a little angry . Maxim was standing there with his hooded gaze so full of the knowledge of motive . But for Laskell at this moment some of his great authority had diminished . ' Will you please tell me what you 're up to ? " Laskell said . " Why do you want this job ? " Maxim said , " A man must live . " It was no answer . Not only was it no answer but it was exactly the kind of thing Maxim could not say , not even if he said it in irony , as no doubt he had . It was another evasion . Maxim did not have to think about making a living , though of course his salary from the Party was ascetically small . Laskell sat tight , saying nothing , as able as Maxim to say nothing and to dictate the pauses . And he won . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Look here . You 've got to do this "  --  in those two phrases there was a personal , a merely personal , urgency . There was even , as Maxim threw out his big hand in a kind of appeal , a throwing away of all political and moral superiority , a dismissal of the two great mural figures that went about with him , a shutting up of the corridors of History . " I want you to call Kermit Simpson . I want you to call him now . " Maxim pointed to the telephone beside Laskell 's chair . " I want you to remind him of my existence after all these years and tell him I 'm all right . I want you to get him to publish an article , not a political article , a literary article . Here  --  I have it here . " Maxim picked up his jacket and took from its inner pocket a folded manuscript , holding it out to Laskell as if it were proof of something . " I want him to publish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a job on his staff . I do n't care what the job is or what it pays . But this must be done right away . "  |p123Laskell  's question came very quietly after the intensity of Maxim 's demand . " And what name will you sign ? " he said . " My own  --  my own name . That 's the point . " Something is wrong here , Laskell thought . This was a strange Maxim , with a look in his eye and a note in his voice that he had never before thought possible . It was a personal look and a personalnote . Maxim wanted something for himself . And as Laskell looked at him , he knew that what Maxim wanted was help , was safety . " Look here , " Laskell said , " what are you up to ? " He spoke sharply because he felt in himself something very like fear at this new aspect of Maxim that could want personal assistance . " I 've told you what I 'm up to , " Maxim said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to live . " His voice was sardonic but his eyes were not . He did not mean making a living . Ile meant not dying . " In order to live , " Maxim said , " I have to exist . You 've got to help me exist . Because I do n't exist now . " It was like facing a man suddenly stripped , and it was more terrible than it should have been . It was Laskell himself who had always had to guard against what he might disclose to Maxim of the narrowness , the merely private character of his own motives , and now , for some reason , the roles were reversed  --  Maxim was the one charged with the personal motive . At no time could that reversalhave been anything but disturbing , yet Laskell , in the midst of his unreasonable fear , knew that his disturbance was too great . But although Maxim might have lost authority , he had not lost his skill . In his pacing back and forth he had come on the photograph of the Grooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up and said , " I hear there 's a good chance that Arthur Groom will go to Washington . This is a good picture of them . " He set the photograph back on the bookcase . " By the way , " he said , " speakingof photographs reminds me  --  " He went to his jacket and felt in the inside pocket again . And Laskell went cold with anger as he knew what Maxim was going to produce . " I was going through some old papers to destroy them and I came across this . " And Maxim held out the snapshot . Laskell 's heart hardened against Maxim as his premonition was shown to be foreknowledge . He did not take the photograph . Maxim put it on the low table . Laskell remembered the occasion when Maxim had come into possession of the picture . He had come in one evening , unannounced , as his habit was . Elizabeth was there and she and Laskell were going over a batch of snapshots taken during a recent week end . Maxim had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intently and Laskell had felt that it was a stern yet benign inspection of their private life . And then , when Maxim had looked at all the pictures once , he had started through the little sheaf again and then held one up and said , " I want this one . " And when the demand had been met with confusion and the natural question , " Why ? " he had answered with that disconcertingdirectness , perhaps intended to disconcert , and that long deep look of his , " Because you 're good . " It was really a very alarmingthing to say and Elizabeth had frowned as if she were angry , as if it were not at all a compliment . But there had been nothing else for her to do except let the picture go . Laskell did not look at the snapshot where Maxim had laid it on the table . Iie said , ' What do you mean , you do n't exist ? " His mind was cold and clear , very firm now . He was very angry . Maxim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wanted him to realize sharply , at closest quarters , that people really did die . It was a cheap , manipulating trick . Maxim mashed out his cigarette in the ash tray . He did it slowly , thoughtfully . He said , " It 's been a year since you last saw me , is n't that so , John ? " He did not wait for an answer . " In that time no one has seen me . No one , that is , who could say he saw me . Or would say , if he could . There 's no record of a person called Gifford Maxim . No one could say that on a certain date I came to dinner . No one could even say that in a certain month he met me and stopped to have a drink with me . I could vanish like that "  --  and he made a gesture  --  " and no one would know that I 'd been missing . I 've been working underground , as they say . " " As they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , not heeding the interruption.  | " And very skillfully . I ceased to exist . That was necessary for the job I was doing . And now I must exist again . Or I may vanish for good . " But surely he looked existent enough as he sat there , a more than usually substantial man . His scar looked very real , a unique identification . He did not look like a man who could either cease to " exist " at will or vanish very easily . " A man who does not exist can be got rid of easily , " Maxim said . " What do you mean , got rid of ? " " I mean , " Maxim said brutally , " killed . " Laskell had known what he meant but he had to have the word . And now that he had it , he naturally did not believe it . Or rather , he believed it and did not believe it . In the same way he believed and did not believe that it was the police that threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxim faced the danger of his work that gave him so much of his power . He staked his safety on his ideas . The scar was a token of how ready he was to do that . But he staked nothing now . He was frightened . He was not merely professionally aware of danger in the line of his duty  --  he was shaken and afraid . To Laskell it was quite terrible to see this , as if something solid were vaporizing before his eyes . He sought for common sense . He said , " You really mean the police would  --  " " I do n't mean the police . " Maxim 's voice was level with what he did mean . " Then what do you mean ? " Laskell said fiercely . But he knew what Maxim meant , or almost knew . He had really known that Maxim did not mean the police . Maxim just looked at him , waiting for him to formulate the answer to his own question . There was a sly , an almost malicious smile on Maxim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter exasperation . " Who then ? Tell me what you do mean . " And Maxim answered him as he knew Maxim would answer . " Look , " Maxim said wearily . " I 'm through with the whole business . Finished . Washed up . Kaput . I 've broken . Now do you un-derstand ? " Although the answer , when it came , was not unexpected , still the meaning of what Maxim had just said broke slowly over Laskellbecause it brought with it the hideous intention of Maxim'spI26 earlier statements . " You ! " Laskell said almost inaudibly . " You ! " And as he said the pronoun twice , he heard how great was his incredulityand how much more than incredulity there was in his voice . Maxim looked back at him , impassive under the surprise , the contempt , the revulsion . It was revulsion that Laskell was feeling , a deep physical disgust . Laskell said curtly , " All right then  --  you 're through . But why all the melodrama ? " Maxim looked at Laskell a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeating the word neutrally and curiously , a new word he was learning in a foreign language . " Melodrama , " he said again . Then he said very politely , " My work was very special , you know . And secret . Special and secret . I 'm supposed to go back to talk things over . The point is that I 'm not going back . I 've wanted perversethings in my time , but I still have n't developed a yearning for the ocean bottom or for a pistol behind my ear . " The room was suddenly very quiet . But from the street came the hot summer noise of children at play , passionate and irritable from the heat . They were the same children whom Laskell had heard calling to each other in his illness , their voices gay and far off , speaking tenderly of life , the background to his mood of rest and peace . Now the voices were ugly and protesting . They were all crying to someone to throw the ball here  --  " Throw it here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then there was a long concerted shout of disgust , and one voice cried in harsh , distinct denunciation , " You dumb cluck ! " There was an enormous empty place in the world where Maxim and his ideas had once been . He said , " Do you mean to say you believe that if you went back  --  ? " He was surprised at how much force Maxim still had , for Maxim had already made him accept the idea of back , although it was one of the beliefs of decency that , for people of Maxim 's Party , or former Party , there was really no such geographical or political direction as back . People of liberal mind understood that the belief in Moscow 's domination of the Party in America had been created by the reactionary press , and they laughed at it . Yet Maxim spoke as if back were a simple fact and had made Laskell accept it . At Laskell 's unfinished question , Maxim turned from the win-pI27dow . On his face was an expression of ultimate pity . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the man who hopes for the best . But Laskell met Maxim 's look with a pity as great  --  it was one thing for a man to abandon his loyalty to the cause he had lived for ; it was quite another thing , and far sadder , for him to spread foul and melodramatic stories about it , such terrible stories as were contained in Maxim 's silent stare , in his talk of ocean bottoms and pistols behind the ear . Then Maxim said with the air of saying his very last word , " John , get this into your head . Just let your mind take it in . I know it 's hard , but you 're a liberal  --  you 're supposed to keep your mind open to new ideas . What I 've been working at has nothing to do with strikes or unions , nothing to do with voting or with relief funds or with publications . I 'm not going to say what it was , but use your head . I was special . " " Giff , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one friend says to another in the extremityof exasperation and it had friendliness in it . But having said it , Laskell found himself flushing , because it was so close to the literal truth . Gifford Maxim could not be insane  --  he who had been almost the embodiment of Reason in action . Yet he was not in his right mind . Otherwise he could not sit there so unmoved , talking about such things as if there were no possible doubt of them , as if there were nothing morally wrong with them , only something to be personally avoided , attributing these things to the very forces that made for the great future . It was a form of paranoia , the persecution-mania . Yet Laskell , although he clung to this formulation , knew that it was only a formulation , not a belief . Or it was one of those things he believed and at the same time did not believe . So far as he believed in Maxim 's insanity , it expressed his full sense of the tragic bitterness of the world , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and a mind so fine as Maxim 's , despite all the great protection of Maxim 's ideas . So far as he believed Maxim was insane , he could pity Maxim and not condemn him . He held hard to his belief and felt it establish itself within him . " When did you get your new view of things ? " he asked . " You mean what led me to the break ? "  | " Well , yes  --  " But that was not what Laskell had had in mind . He was ashamed that it was not . His first question should have been about doctrine and line . A truly political man would have asked just such a question , at this point or earlier . At my age , he said to himself , I should be politically mature enough . But what he had meant was , when had Maxim got the new conception of things that led him to assume this violence , to believe that he would be in danger of his life if he went , as he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ? In the large , mature , practical view of things , the question about doctrine and line was the first one to be asked . But it was the other question that Laskell pressed . " When did you come to believe such things as that you 'd be in danger  --  there ? " " And here , " said Maxim . " And here too . I 've always known it . " His simplicity was unexpected . It threw into a very strange light the certainty and skill of the answers he had made to Laskell when Laskell had asked him to explain the Moscow trials and the rumorsabout the actions of the Party in Spain . Maxim shrugged . " I 've always known it . It 's just that now I 'm in it  --  me  --  myself . " " You 've always known it ? " Laskell was not sure which word he wished to emphasize . Maxim nodded . " Yes , " he said flatly . Then he said in modification , " Of course , not always , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know things . And that 's been a long time . " " Long enough so that you can now say that the things you told me were lies ? " " I was n't lying  --  I was defending a position . " " It never made any difference to you before ? It 's only when you yourself are in danger  --  or consider yourself in danger ? " " I was a professional , " said Maxim in a cold voice . " What matteredto me were results . I always knew what the means were . They are not delicate or charming . They are even brutal . Please understand that I never had any of the liberal illusions about that . I was not , as you are , interested in ideals . I was interested in results . As a revolutionary I was wholly professional . But now the results do not please me . The present results and the inevitable later results . It 's not what I bargained for . " His voice became explanatorily simple , as if it were Laskellp129who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual perplexity . " It 's not a sudden view , it 's been forcing itself on me for some time . I 've kept quiet  --  if you take the professional attitudeabout revolution , you do n't permit yourself the luxury of ideas . You give them up with a certain pleasure . Up to a point . But I reached that point . And passed it . And since I know the means , I do n't want any such means applied to me . As I said , I 've wanted perverse things in my time , but not  --  " Laskell broke in , " I can understand a change of heart or mind . But I ca n't believe you when you talk of terrorism . I 've known several people who have broken with the Party for one reason or another , and you know them too  --  " " It is n't only that I 've changed my mind . I was special . I told you I was special . I am still special . " " Yes , you 've told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what that means . Do you want to tell me what it means ? " Maxim seemed to consider . " No , " he said at last . " Was that business with the letters when you were last here  --  was that part of it ? " " Yes , " said Maxim casually . " Did n't you know that then ? Was n't that why you refused ? " " No . I do n't know why I refused . " Maxim raised his expressive eyebrow . " You do n't ? I think you 're wrong . You knew . Though perhaps you did n't know that you knew . " " No , I did n't know . " But Maxim might be right . Perhaps there had been in Maxim 's manner some indication , unobserved but responded to , that suggested that this matter went beyond what Laskellwas ready for , beyond what Maxim scornfully called ideals . " I think you knew then , " said Maxim . " And that 's in part why I 'm here . " Maxim seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , a little pale . Laskell said , " You actually think that because I refused to receive those letters I have declared myself ready to help you now  --  now that you 've turned ? You 're fantastic ! " Maxim 's best tactic was not to say anything at all . He knew it and sat silent . Then Laskell said , " What made you come to me about those letters ? If your business was so special and secret ? "  | " I had to ask someone . Someone in your position . If you said yes , well and good . If you said yes , I would have known I could trust you . " " Thank you . " Maxim was silent again , looking as if there were nothing more for him to say . " Granting there is danger if you go back  --  though I do not grant it  --  what danger is there if you do n't go ? " " I 've told you . I do n't exist . I was important . I knew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I do n't exist . Not as a  --  citizen . " He smiled at the idea of his being a citizen . " And if I do n't exist , something can happen to me . No one would know it , no one would report it . Someone must know of my existence . You know . And that nurse of yours , Paine , she knows now . " So that was the point of that pointless conversation with Paine ! It was not likely that Paine would forget that she had seen and talked with a Mr. Maxim on the twelfth of July . " But that is n't enough . I must have a continuous existence , an office I go to every day , so that it is perfectly clear that if one day I do n't appear , questions will be asked . I must be on record to be safe . I want my existence established on , say , the masthead of The New Era . The more I exist and the more I exist publicly , the safer I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " For God 's sake , Giff , put your mind to this . I know the people you 're talking about . You 've introduced me to some of them yourself . I do n't accept all their ideas , but they 're ordinary people , some of them really just middle-class citizens with decent social ideas . Gentle people . They could n't do such a thing . " " Those people would n't do it , " Maxim said . " They could n't even order it done . " It was astonishing how he could pick up Maxim 's malign implications . " They could n't  --  it 's not in them . " " They would n't have to . They would never know about it , the ones you know . " " Who would then ? " " It would be done . There 's reason for its being done and it can still be done safely . Can be  --  until I get myself an existence . " Maxim said it as if this time he had really said his last word. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word existence that he kept repeating , that decided Laskell to believe that Maxim was not in his right mind . He felt ashamed of himself for not havingacted on his first perception of this , for allowing himself to be drawn into political argument with a demented man , for harassing a mentally ill man with the quibbles of reason . He smiled to Maxim and reached for the telephone . " What are you doing ? " Maxim cried , leaping from the chair and seizing Laskell 's wrist . If anything was needed to show Laskell how deeply that powerfulmind was enmeshed in its wild corrupt fantasy , it was this sudden start from the chair , the iron hold on his wrist , the suspicionthat some treachery was about to be committed . Laskell said , " I 'm calling Kermit Simpson . " Maxim slowly sank back into his chair , looking ashamed of his fright . There was no reason why Simpson should not be called into service . It was no longer a matter of politics , no longer a matter of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a good heart . He liked to say that he was non-partisan in his liberalism . If Kermit knew the facts , he would be willing to help . And then , with the phone in his hand , Laskell wondered what he meant by " help "  --  had he been caught in the net of Maxim 's fantasy ? Did Maxim really need the help he demanded ? Was Maxim actually in the danger he spoke of so wildly ? But then Laskell understood what he was doing . He was quieting Maxim 's strange panic by finding for him some kind of anchor or base , something to hold on to . But he had never thought the day would come when he would take command of a situation that was beyond Maxim 's control . There was no one in The New Era office except a secretary and Laskell could hear in her voice the lonely isolation of the secretary who keeps the office in summer during that profound lull when the poorest of intellectuals seems able to leave the city to its wide and echoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying vainly to establish contact with his old friends in this empty city , thought of what Maxim must have felt when he came in to find the bags packed for yet another departure.  | " Kermit is up at his place near Westport , " he said when he had this information from the desolate secretary . " I 'll try him there . " Maxim sat there with his reason all about him , except for the single rift that delusion made . It was perhaps but temporary , the result of some terrible emotional crisis . Kermit Simpson had a large soft heart and Maxim could surely be left in it . He reached Kermit in Westport . Kermit was full of congratulationsfor Laskell 's recovery and all reminiscent pleasure at the mention of Maxim 's name . But at the proposal that he give Maxim a job on The New Era he checked and pulled up short . He had the idealistic rich man 's first response , the fear of being used . " There 's no money in the budget for the job , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Era on a budget . " He was very proud of that budget . " And besides , " he said , " he 's a pretty political character . " But it did not occur to Simpson to ask why so political a character should want a job on his magazine . He was a very innocent man . " No , " said Laskell and glanced at Maxim , who sat unmoving , and then permitted himself a cruelty . " No , I would n't say he 's a political character any more . Not in the way you mean . " Maxim did not give even a flicker of response and Laskell 's heart smote him for having taken so easy an advantage of a corrupted man , a weakened mind . And that led him to say with great intensity of persuasion , " Kermit , I want you to see him , I want it very much . " Simpson said , " All right . Can he come up to see me tomorrow at noon ? " Laskell could hear in his voice the division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken advantage of . " Can you go up to Westport tomorrow ? " Laskell asked Maxim . Maxim nodded . " About noon ? " Maxim nodded again . " He 'll be there , Kermit . " And somehow all of Maxim 's loss of moral glory was in that sentence that made him a disposable object  --  " he , " the poor sad patient whom the well-dressed doctors were trying to help . Paine came in with the ice cream and Maxim went to the kitchenetteto help her serve it out . He made no comment on the arrangement , offered no gratitude . He seemed quite to accept thep133role of patient . But when they were all three eating the ice cream , he said , " Where do the Crooms live ? " " In Connecticut , a little place called Crannock . I go to Hartford and take the local train from there . " " Tomorrow ? On what train ? " " The ten-twelve . " " I 'll call for you and we can take the train together . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The idea of the trip alone had been frightening to Laskell  --  it was astonishing how he had lost his nerve about so ordinary a thing . It was impossible to contemplate taking the trip with this man in whom one could almost hear the dim , slow sound of disintegration . " No ! " he said again . " Why , what an excellent idea ! " It was the sure voice of Paine , the voice of nannies and nurseries , of coal fires and bad drains , of bread-and-butter and cambric tea , and an egg to tea , of rooks in the elms and the Christmas pantomime , of not whimpering and of keeping your chin up , of all the comfortable certainties of his childhood reading in English books . " You 're very rude , " said Paine . " An excellent idea . And Mr. Maxim can help you with the luggage . You have to be careful liftingthings , you know , after such a long fever . The muscles are weakened , particularly of the feet , and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Mr. Maxim looks strong enough for two . " Betrayed and trapped , Laskell sat there with nothing to say and nothing to do except to fight down as best he could a rising flutteringin his stomach . He woke weary the next morning , drained and dry behind the eyes . He had remembered in the night the claim that Maxim had upon him  --  Maxim 's quiet company evening after evening in the clays after Elizabeth had died . Now Maxim , in his loss , had come to Laskell . Beyond his use of the photograph , Maxim had not utteredthe claim , and Laskell , now , was glad that he had not , that Maxim had got what help he had without any bargaining . He was also glad that , since the claim did exist , he had given Maxim whatp134help he could . He found it strange that not until he was alone and sleepless that night had he remembered there was any claim at all . And when he did remember it , he remembered the stern and hollowfeeling of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered it again , experienced the negation and hopelessness just as if three years had not passed . It did not make the coming trip a happier adventure for Laskell that Maxim presented himself at eight o'clock , dirty , dark-eyed , unshaven , and asking for breakfast and a bath . " Well , you 've been on the tiles , my good man , " said Paine happilyand went to draw the bath . " She speaks truer than she knows , " Maxim said . " Except that your roof is tin . " He had spent the night on the roof . Laskell had to put the fact from his mind , it was too awful even to contemplate . He had saved until the moment before the farewell the gift he had ordered for Paine . There had been no trouble in choosing it . He had had merely to order what he had decided would make just the right gift ; he had found it easily enough one morning when Paine was out marketing , by making a single telephone call to the likeliest store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain as if designed to army specifications and stitched to endure forever and to descend to Paine 's grandnieces . Paine received it with the air of protest and surprise that is learned by people who receive presents in the way of business . Paine said , " Oh , Mr. Laskell , too good of you , really . What a lovely handbag , " very genteel and not looking at him . She held out to him a dry hand . Dressed now in her street clothes , she looked shabbier than ever . " You 've been a nice patient , " she said . She meant it , but there was a kind of forgiveness in her voice , as though she knew she had been imposed on all along and had decided not to mind . " Now I want you to be a good boy and take care of yourself . " It was only nurses ' talk  --  there was no longer any connection between them , nor did she have any remembrance of a connection . She had bathed him and shaved him , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had first heard his voice in the obscurities of delirium . So long as her function lasted she hadp135thrown her protection around him , and to him it had appeared in the form of love . Now her function was at an end . Laskell thought of the gift he was to have given her every year at Christmas , the dull quiet evenings he had planned to spend taking his old nurse to dinner and theater . Now he knew he would probably never see her again and this first gift of his was the last . The gray and peacefulillusion was over . Maxim , mad or not , corrupted or not , could help with the chores of closing the apartment , could pick up all the bags , Paine 's as well as Laskell 's , leaving Laskell only the rod and creel , could carry them down the stairs , turning his head to say to Laskell , " Take it easy now , " and could go to the corner to find a taxi . " I took the creel , Paine , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , and he pointed to it in proof . " Oh  --  sound idea . Good boy . " I le had asked for her approval and she gave it . But she was not much interested . Paine got into the taxi with Maxim and Laskell . She was to be let off at Fifth Avenue and Twenty-eighth Street . Why just at that place she did not say . At Twenty-sixth Street she again held out her hand in farewell . " Be a good boy , " she said . She nodded briskly and cordially to Maxim . " Good-by , Mr. Maxim . See to it that he behaves . " With that her tie to him ended and there she was , standing on the sidewalk , alone and indistinguishable , looking for a way to cross the avenue , rather inept , her competence hidden . It was the last he would ever see of her . Alone with Maxim , Laskell wanted to say something about Paine that would refer to his own large feelings and yet suit those still larger social considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern society , the individual and his relation to the social whole , the breaking of the communal bonds . But any remark that would reflect his own isolation would be lacking in tact to this man who was really so much more alone . The remarkitself would not actually " hurt " Maxim , but the deficiency in tact would be offensive to him , for Maxim always insisted on the code of delicacy and politeness , bourgeois though it was . What Laskell said was , " By the way , do you have any money ? " " Enough for a while . "  | Laskell took out his wallet and drew three ten-dollar bills from it . " Will thirty be enough ? " he said , and then he felt himself flush at the number he had chosen . Had something in his mind wished to offer the traitor Maxim thirty pieces of silver ? But Maxim had not noticed the number , or gave no sign of noticing . " Thanks , John . Can you spare it ? " " Yes , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that there was this notable difference between them , that Maxim meant money while he had meant cash . In the station , under the great blue dome with its faint gold constellations , Laskell felt how weak and inadequate his legs were . " Do n't hurry , " Maxim said . " Plenty of time . You 're still a little shaky , are n't you ? " It was so . Even Maxim was a comfort here among all the peopleso brutally intent upon making trains or appointments . And Maxim chose a double seat on what , when they emerged into the light , would be the shady side of the car , and heaved the bags up on the rack  --  it was a great relief . Laskell could forget the disgust with which he had regarded Maxim 's moral defection , if it was that , or the pity with which he had regarded Maxim 's madness , if it was that . But he did not miss observing that Maxim had chosen the last car of the train . He could at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the platform . But when Maxim chose a seat at the very rear of this last car , Laskell was sure there was strategy in it . Their position had been chosen to lessen the chances of anybody approaching from the rear . And Maxim then substantiated Laskell'sconclusion by saying , " I guess this is the best place for me . " It was terribly sad , this absurd precaution , but it was the only sign of delusion that Maxim gave . For the rest he was an almost pleasant companion . He asked about all kinds of people they had known together in the days before Maxim had given the whole of his life to the Party and had cut himself off from so many things . He was as social as anyone traveling in the direction of Westport.  | TELLING the story of Maxim 's visit to the Crooms was even more difficult than Laskell had anticipated . How difficult he expected it to be he understood when , walking to the Grooms ' house that evening , he had to acknowledge that his heart was quickening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had something of the normal anxiousness he might have felt if he were just about to make a public speech on a difficult matter , though with every reason to suppose that he would in the end do credit to himself . But it was odd that he should have felt even this much excitement at the prospect of telling the story . After all , it was nothing more than a piece of news to be imparted to Arthur and Nancy . Yet he had eaten his supper that evening with an enforcedcalm and had even been at pains to make himself neat for the occasion , going to his room to change his shirt , though it was quite fresh , and to brush his hair . ' While he was in his room he recalledthat he had not made the test of his urine that day  --  lately he was beginning to forget to do this  --  and he heated the test tube over the lamp he had lit on his dresser and dropped in the acetic acid when it boiled , noting with satisfaction that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , though damp , and there was a mild , driftingmist . The days were noticeably drawing in and Laskell needed a flashlight for the road . The segment of mist that was lit by the conic beam of the flashlight was turbulent , but he had only to look outside the cone of light to see that its main movement was large , slow , and drifting . The air was filled with the perpetual sound of crickets , the sound of summer that speaks of summer 's end . It spoke of this now to Laskell , as it always had , ever since boyhood , with its pleasant melancholy of things ending , a conscious and noble melancholy leading to hope and the promise of things to come , of things beginning , all the liveliness of autumn , of new starts , the renewed expectation that , this year , one 's personal characterwould learn the perfect simplicity one wished it to have . The Crooms had finished dinner and were sitting in that unfinishedbut already charming living-room of theirs when Laskell arrived . He naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his steps on the path being enough , and they greeted him as casuallyas if he had not arrived at all but had merely come back after having stepped out for a look at the weather . Arthur said , " Hi , feller ! " and went on whittling the block of wood that was to be a boat for Micky . There was newspaper spread out at his feet to catch the shavings . Nancy was wearing a long house-coat of light blue and her sunny hair was turned up and bound with a ribbon . She sat under a lamp and her only greeting to Laskell was to say aloud what she had been murmuring to herself , " Forty-seven , forty-eight , forty-nine , fifty , fifty-one , " warning him that he must not speak to her nor she to him until she had finished the count of her knitting stitches . Seventy-four was the number of stitches she was counting and when she reached it she said , " Hello , John . " But while the countingcontinued , John Laskell had a perception . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Laskell it suddenly seemed that the sound no longer spoke with the sweet melancholy of the end of summer . It seemed to him that it was the sound made by the passing of time , a very different thing . It was not like an elegy heard with pleasure in its sadness , but like the inexorable ticking away of life itself . The Crooms in their house together had shut themselves off from it as snugly as they would have shut themselvesoff against a storm . They had made everything tight , seen to all the windows , looked in on their child to see that he was undisturbed , and now were the happier for what was going on outside . But Laskell could not share the shelter which they had together . He felt suddenly exposed to the whole force of the movement that was indicated by that ceaseless noise of time rushing away . He had a desire , not for shelter  --  he could not hope for that much  --  but for something he could hang on to as standing against the movement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its end butp139did not go on to speak of new beginnings . It spoke only of the end of all other summers . Laskell , standing there while Nancy counted , had the sense  --  and he wondered if it carne eventually to every man and if it always came so early in life  --  that there was really no future . He did not mean that he had no future . He meant that the futureand the present were one  --  that the present could no longer contrive and manufacture the future by throwing forward , in the form of expectation and hope , the desires of the present moment . It was not that he had " lost hope , " but only that he did not make a distinction between what he now had and was and what he expected to have and be . The well-loved child of the middle class is taught about the future by means ' of the promises made to him  --  the birthday gifts will come and the Christmas gifts will come , and the performance at the Hippodrome , and camp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises and their fulfillment are symbolic of the great promise , made to him by everyone , that he will grow and change . This great promise he takes into himself in the form of a pledge  --  made to himself and to everyone  --  that he will grow and change for the better . He takes it into himself too in the particular form of his vision of time , in which the future is alwaysbrighter and more spacious than the present . How the mind of the fortunate young man of the middle class is presided over by the future ! It is his mark , his Muse  --  for it is feminine in its seductiveness  --  andsets him apart from the young men of the truly lower class and from the young men of the truly upper class . What happened to Laskell , all at once , was that he realized that you could n't live the life of promises without yourself remaining a child . The promise of the future might have its uses as a way of seducing the child to maturity , but maturity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , that you lived your life now instead of preparing and committing yourself to some betterday to come . His new perception of the nature of time struck him with very great force . Yet it was not especially startling . The only thing that was startling about it was that it came so suddenly , in this moment of differentiation between the Grooms and himself . It was not painful  --  or no more painful than the change that had taken placep140when , at a certain age , the special and mysterious expectation of Christmas and birthdays was no longer appropriate and his parents began to give him his gifts quite as a matter of course , most affectionatelystill , but without their eyes shining in the excitement of seeing their son 's wonder and impatience being now satisfied and even exceeded by reality ; or just as going to the theater was no longer a matter of waiting for that blessed Saturday on which would be revealed Annette Kellerman in the tank or Charlotte on the ice but became a simple transaction , a call to the ticket-agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interval , between the decision to go to the theater and the going . It was not a gay feeling , this change in the character of the relation between present and future , but it was certainly not an unhappyone . The well-loved child of the middle class had always done everything with an exemption granted , for the future was made not only of promises but also of opportunities for forgiveness , and redemptions , and second or third chances . As Laskell looked back on this evening with the Crooms , he found that his odd idea about the future and the present being one brought its own heroism . It had a kind of firm excitement or excited firmness that was connected with his feeling that at this very moment he had the full measure of existence  --  now , at this very moment , now or never , not at some other and better time that lay ahead . If at this moment he did not have the simplicity of character he wanted , he would never have it ; if he was not now answerable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy , seventy-one , seventy-two , seventy-three , seventy-four . " Nancy finished counting and said , " Hello , John . " Arthur , released from the necessity of silence , said , " Nancy tells me that you have news from Gifford Maxim . " He was still whittlingat the boat . " Why no , " Laskell began . Nancy made a surprised and questioningsound and Laskell said , " Not news from him but news about him . " And although he had planned to lead up to it , for the sake of verisimilitude , he now thought it best to let them have it all at once . " Maxim has broken , " he said . They looked at him both in amazement and in lack of under/standing . But if they were amazed , they must understand , and if they did not understand , how could they be amazed ? " Broken ? " said Arthur . " What do you mean , broken ? " But Arthur of course knew what it meant and Laskell found himself not answering . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . Then it occurred to him that this was a trick of Maxim 's and he said , " Broken with the Communist Party , of course . " " No ! " said Arthur . Then he said , " For Pete 's sake ! " Then he said , " Giff Maxim ? " And not until he had expressed his amazementin three separate utterances did he feel that he was beginning to come into possession of the astonishing fact . Nancy 's incredulity was more coherent . " I do n't believe it , " she announced . But there was nothing else for her to do except believe it . " I ca n't believe it , " she said , meaning that although her mind gave a formal assent to the truth of the statement , she had no emotionswith which to accommodate it , and no real desire for such emotions . Laskell did not try to deal with their incredulity . He simply sat and waited for it to pass . The story had yet to be told and its difficultypressed upon him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the block of wood on the sofa beside him . He had the set , strong , and chastened look of a man who has just had information of the highest importance which does not at that very moment affect his personal life , although , as he well knows , it must eventually touch him adversely in some personal way . Yet the event is so great , so dramatic , that he can not but feel a pleasure in his excitement , which he tries to suppress . Arthur Croom had probably looked not much different at the moment he had learned of the Reichstag fire . He and Nancy for a moment had nothing to say . If Gifford Maxim had been susceptible to compliment  --  but that was impossible  --  nothing could have flattered him more than the silence in which they sat . In retrospect Laskell knew that the Crooms were not at all pleased with him for being the bearer of such news . And even as he told the story  --  or rather , as the Crooms put their questions topI42 him afterward  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story on himself rather than about Maxim . But he did resist it . A particular tone came into his voice as he answered their questions , a note of strictness and even of irony . It was this note in his own voice that made him aware that his sense of time , his feeling about the future , had really changed . The Crooms seemed to be asking their questions with the assumption that if everything was not right and clear about Gifford Maxim , neither was everything right and clear about John Laskell . And ordinarily he would have let them rest in this assumption until it should pass of itself , as of course it would have done . He would have been sympathetic to their need to blame someone , to hold someone accountable immediately , a need so pressing that they were even willing temporarily to hold Laskell accountable . He would have been willing to let them impute some guilt to himself of which he could be sure the future would clear him . But tonight he resisted this impulse to feel guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imputations , of course  --  at the very moment they were uttered , not waiting for the future to set them right . Thus , when he told them about the trip with Maxim , he explainedabout Maxim 's choosing the last car and the last seat in the last car and said , " He did that so that no one could come at him from behind . " At this Nancy said , " Did he say that was why he did it ? " Laskell answered , " No , not in so many words . All he said was , This is the place for me . ' " Nancy said , " And you thought that that meant he would be attacked ? Why should you think such a thing ? " Laskell said , " I did n't think he would be attacked . I thought that he thought he would be attacked . " And his voice was clear and firm . It required Nancy to understand the truth now , at this very moment ; it refused to allow her to indulge even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposing him in the wrong . The question of Maxim 's belief in the possibility of attack led the Grooms to the question of Maxim 's sanity , for when Laskell explainedvery precisely that the idea of the attack was not his but Maxim 's , Nancy said , " Oh  --  he 's mad . I mean really  --  he 's insane . " She had expressed that view before . She had listened in silencep143to Laskell 's account of the visit up through its climax , heard in horror Maxim 's belief that he did not exist , that in order to be safe he needed a public certification such as Kermit Simpson 's magazinewould give him . She had barely been able to take it in . She had been incredulous when she had heard that Maxim had broken with the Party . She had sat silent , looking puzzled and annoyed when Laskell told of what and of whom Maxim was afraid , much as if she were listening to some new conception of the universe so abstract that it was hopeless for her to put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the detail of Maxim 's having slept on the roof . Then she had said , " Why did he do that ? " And Laskell had answered , " Presumably for safety . " At this she had cried out , " Why , the man 's insane ! He is , is n't he , John ? " Laskell had said , " It certainly occurred to me to think so . " Nancy had then used the word not quite literally , meaning perhapsno more by it than that Maxim was mistaken in the extreme . But now she was quite literal , entirely clinical . She said in a very literal voice , " He is insane , is n't he , John ? " " Well  --  " Laskell paused to consider . " Do n't you think so ? You said you thought so . " " Yes , at the time the idea did come to me , in a way . " " In a way ? At the time ? Do n't you think so now ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But you said so . You were with him . You heard him say those things . You yourself heard him say he was in danger . You said he slept on the roof and that he was afraid of beingattacked from the rear . He 's obviously insane . " Arthur said , " I doubt if you 'll get very far in politics , Nan , with the language of individual psychopathology . " " I 'm not talking about politics , " Nancy said irritably . " I 'm talking about Gifford Maxim . If insanity is n't the opposite of reason , what is it ? " Arthur said as gently as possible , " But think how many people talk about the German developments as if they are to be understoodin terms of individual psychopathology . " " And so they are ! That and the weakness and vacillation of thep144Social Democrats . " She said to Laskell , " What is he , if he is n't in-sane ? " Laskell had not thought of the alternatives before , but he consideredthem now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or he might be deliberately lying . " And then , merely in the way of the next step in a series of possibilities , " Or he might be right , " he said . " You think he might be right ? " Nancy said . " My God , John ! " And Arthur said very gravely , even a little sternly , " Do you really , John ? " It was , of course , a very important question . He did not answer quickly . " I did n't say so . I was only stating all the possibilities . I 'm simply not sure that we can finish it off by saying that he 's insane . " " No , I agree with you , " Arthur said . " But if he 's not insane , what is the matter with him ? What could have led him to this ? " Again Laskell hesitated . " You must remember that he 's a professional  --  thathe was a professional , " he corrected himself with a smile . " Lenin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small group of professionals . Giff knew a great deal and was very deeply committed . That 's why he seemed so important to us , is n't it ? After all , we 've been nothing but liberals and perhaps that 's all we 'll ever be . That 's all right , but it means that we pretty much limit ourselves to ideas  --  and ideals . When we act , if we can call it action , it 's only in a peripheral way . We do have sympathies with the Party , and even , in a way , with its revolutionary aims . But maybe , sympathetic as we are , we prefer not to think about what the realities of such a party are . " Arthur said in a very quiet voice , " Then you 're saying in effect that Maxim was telling the truth . And apparently you 're basing your belief on the assumption of a conspiratorial party . But surely you would n't say that that assumption stands up ? You do n't actuallythink he was telling the truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't say I did . " A silence fell now , one of the many silences of that evening . It was no longer possible for Laskell to evade the fact that , in the Crooms ' eyes , he was touched with Maxim 's guilt . Not that they were precisely blaming him for anything , but they felt that he had been led into error somehow . And waiting out the silence as he suddenly could , Laskell thought how much of life was being con/ducted as a transaction between guilt and innocence . Even among people who were devoted only to ideas of progress and social equalityand not at all to action , there had grown an unusual desire to discover who was innocent and who was guilty ; who could be trusted and who needed to be watched . This was strange when one reflected on how much the idea of personal responsibility had been shaken by modern social science . Educated people more and more accounted for human action by the influence of environment and the necessities and habits imposed by society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever before . Laskell remembered the strange confessions of the great Commissars , the former heroes of the Revolution of 1917 , which were so difficult to understand , not because it was inconceivable that the men should be guilty  --  their guilt , after some doubt , had become quite clear to Laskell  --  but because the spiritual quality of what they said was so little in accord with an age of reason , because the defendants were so deeply involved , as their speeches of confession showed , with the idea of personal guilt . It was an apparent contradiction in Marx 's Capital , that would some day be worth putting his mind to , that in the great chapters on the working day the industrialmiddle class was denounced on moral grounds , although in a preface the writer had explicitly exempted individual industrialistsfrom moral censure , saying with an almost gracious reassurancethat it was not they but the historical process that must be blamed . And the events in Germany would seem to show that even among those terrible people there was the preoccupation with guilt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , for the wronged and the weak are the innocent ; so much cruelty to separate themselves from the guilty , for those who are punished are guilty and those who punish are innocent ; so much adoration of strength , for the strong who once were weak are never guilty . Arthur broke the silence . " John , I 'd like to ask one question , " he said in a frank voice . " Why did you wait until now to tell us this ? " And Nancy said , " Yes , John . Why did you ? " It was the question that Laskell had of course been waiting for , and in a way it was a relief to have it asked , to have the charge made.  |p146He  decided to lie . " I do n't know why I did . It was pretty unpleasant , after all . I just did n't want to talk about it . " They accepted the explanation generously . Arthur nodded in understanding . Nancy said , " I can see that . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you should have told us . " But of course he had not yet told them anything . He had told them only that Maxim had come to him with the information that he had broken with the Party , that he feared for his life and wished to establish an existence , that he had slept on the roof and taken the train with Laskell , choosing the last car of the train and the last seat in the car because he feared an attack from the rear . And the true story was so much more than this . The true whole story was so much more than the mere record of the facts of Maxim 's defection . It was that Laskell had been sick and that he had been deeply involved with himself and two nurses , that he had been inexplicably interested in questions of being , in questions of his own existence , and that he had become well and bickered endlesslywith Paine ; it was that he had thought of Arthur Groom and Maxim as contradictory but complementary parts of political life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Paine were quarrelingabout his taking his fishing gear , when Paine had been encouraginghim to this assertion of health . Then they ought to know certain things about his feelings in connection with Maxim , such as his sense of submitting to a proces-verbal when Maxim talked to him , and his absurd notion of the great mural figures that went around with Maxim . Then there was Maxim 's trick of bringing out the photograph , and Maxim 's claim upon him , that very specialclaim which he had not realized until after Maxim had gone . And there was the farewell to Paine . These things , under almost any circumstances , were not easy to talk about , yet he had been in the habit of talking with the Grooms about difficult matters , though not usually difficult personal matters . But the point was that this was the story they had all along not wished to hear  --  the story of his illness which was so much a part of the Maxim story . Of the true story he had so far given them only a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that I was even more disturbed than youp147might guess , and for reasons you would n't know . It was , as a personalexperience , very shaking . " " It must have been , " Nancy said softly . " You looked dreadful when you got here . I was frightened by the way you looked . And you were n't yourself . You were very strange . I said so to Arthur  --  I said you seemed not like yourself at all . And now I scarcely wonder , traveling with that  --  " Unable to name Maxim , she was even unable to characterize him . " Yes , I can understand your not talking about it . " So Nancy forgave him for not talking about it on his arrival ? Laskell smiled . " It 's more than that , Nancy . You see , I 've known Maxim longer than you have , and I 've known him in a different way . You think of him politically . I suppose I 've thought of him that way too for quite a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I suppose it 's important in the way I felt . I suppose it 's important in the way I felt that Maxim suddenly produced an old snapshot of Elizabeth that he said he wanted to return to me . " Laskelllit a cigarette . " It was the picture I showed you this morning , Nancy . " He saw Nancy 's face set . He had expected it would . Her voice was very precise as she said , " Yes . But why ? " " You mean , why did he show me Elizabeth 's picture ? I do n't know , really . But I can guess several reasons . He may have wanted to confuse my emotions . If I could give you an idea of his manner that afternoon , you would understand what I mean . It seemed as if every smallest thing he did or said had an intention . Or perhaps he wanted to remind me of the past  --  to make me emotional so that I would n't have my wits about me . Or  --  " Laskell paused ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he only wanted to make it real to me . " Nancy said , " Make it real to you ? Make what real ? " " That people do actually die . " Arthur said briskly , " Are n't you being a little hypersubtle ? A little too psychological ? " Laskell shrugged . " Maybe so . But we are n't exactly in a context of simplicities , are we ? " Laskell waited just a fraction of a moment , then he said , " It may be , of course , that his motive was much sim/pier . He may have wanted to remind me of a claim he had on me for my help . " Nancy had put down her knitting some time back . She was sittingwith her feet neatly together and her knees neatly together and her hands tightly clasped on her knees , her head bent over her hands . She had been looking at her clasped hands . Now she looked up sharply . " A claim on you ? What kind of claim could he have on you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should think that after what he told you , all claims would be at an end . At an end immediately . " " It was a personal claim  --  he was very good to me after Elizabeth died . " " Oh . " Nancy picked up her knitting . Well , it had been done . The " claim " and Elizabeth 's death had been brought together . They had been spoken in one sentence . Never before in his life had Laskell said anything to anybody in order to see if it would produce a particular response . He was stricken and ashamed that he should have done it first with Nancy . He had introduced the mention of the snapshot to test her . She had not passed the test . He had introduced the claim Maxim had on him , again to try her response . She had responded badly . She had disclosed herself as he had maneuvered her to  --  she had disclosedher deficiency of emotion , her fear of talking about the dead Elizabeth . But his own intention had been mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be out of the system of innocence and guilt to which he too consented by testing his friends . How had he allowed Nancy to move so far out of his system of love , how had he put her into this system of accusation ? But now accuse her he must . " Claims " were of the past , the dead were of the past . They had no place in Nancy 's bright , shining future , and he , Laskell , by giving them place in his thought , had committed what amounted to an obscenity . It was what he had been suspecting ever since his arrival in the country and now he had his proof . When it came to acquiring significant information for the dossier , he was a perfect little Maxim of an interrogator . A great weight settled on his spirit . It was Nancy who resumed the conversation . She said , " John ,  |p149you  said that you had n't seen Maxim for a year and that you thought he was angry at you because you had refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it you refused to do ? Why did you refuse ? " Her voice was soft and rather tired . Arthur said reasonably , " John had no commitment , Nan . He 's helped with particular things , just as we 've done , when our views have happened to coincide with the Party 's  --  specific issues , like free speech or relief for political prisoners , things like that . " " Yes . Of course , " said Nancy quietly . " I was n't blaming John . I just wanted to know what and why . " " I 'll tell you what I refused , " Laskell said . " But I 'm not sure I can tell you why . Gifford asked me if I would receive certain lettersaddressed to me and addressed in a particular way that would distinguish them from the rest of my mail , and then turn them over to him , or to someone he would send , without opening them . " Arthur said , " Oh , that ! Yes  --  he asked us the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was perfectly all right , but the element of secrecy put me off . So we said no . " How enviable it was , the easy , guiltless way Arthur spoke of his refusal . His naturally political temperament permitted him to grant or refuse requests according to nothing but reason . " What do you suppose all the secrecy was about ? " Laskell asked . Arthur shrugged . " That was Maxim 's business . I do n't know and I did n't ask . " " He said that his work was special and secret . Those were the words he used , special and secret . ' He made a point of saying that it had nothing to do with organizations or strikes . But when I asked him what it did have to do with , he would n't say . He just repeatedthat it was special and secret . But he did admit that the lettershad something to do with whatever was special and secret . ' What do you suppose it was ? " " I do n't know , " Arthur said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then he gave Laskell the benefit of his guiltless political nature by saying casually , " It 's just as well that you refusedtoo . " It was at that moment that Laskell had the sensation about Nancy . For it was a sensation and not a perception  --  it was as simpleand direct as if it were a sound or a smell . It was as if he couldp150feel her existing in a circumambient reservation , as if she were not in the same relation to himself and Arthur that he was in to Arthur or Arthur to him . She was in a relation to something else , to herself , or to some special knowledge she had . But it was not until he was back at the Folgers ' and in his brass bed that Laskell understood what the sensation meant . Then it came to him with perfect certainty : Nancy had not said no to Maxim 's request . Arthur had said no for both the Grooms . Nancy had allowed him to think that the answer stood . But Nancy had not said no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Arthur and had sought out Maxim and had privately said yes . It was surely the first separation of herself from Arthur that Nancy had ever made . It was very puzzling and rather frightening . But he did not know whether he was frightenedfor Nancy or by her . He lay a long time in the dark that night , listening to the very faint movement of the tree outside his window . Once more he turned over in his mind just what it meant to feel that the future was no longer real , or that , if it was real at all , it was coexistent with the present . And once more he thought of the future as a characteristic concept of the well-loved young man of the middle class , brought up on promises . And what has changed ? he asked himself . Was it that he was not well loved ? Or not of the middle class ? Oh , surely of the middle class . Perhaps not so well loved as he once had been . And surely no longer young . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressed by it . He could not sleep , but he did not mind that . There was a kind of gratification in the grave and not very happy thoughts he had . He was not able to identify this gratification . There was much to think about in connection with the conversation he had been having . There were certain questions that occurredto him . For example , he found himself asking why Arthur , who was so political , had accepted the fact of Maxim 's break with the Party without inquiring into its reasons . He himself had avoided that inquiry , although Maxim had expressly given him the chance to make it . He had been ashamed that he had not gone into the theoretical grounds for Maxim 's action . But why had Arthur not done so ? For Arthur was really political . Arthur 's agreementp151with the Party began where theory left off and where morals and will began . He had many differences with the Party and was sometimeseven inclined to smile at the economic statements of the Party'stheorists . He thought the Party ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went no further than that . Yet he had not asked for an explanation of why Maxim had broken . He had not , it was true , gone quite the whole way with Nancy in giving insanity as the reason . Still , he had not thought of explaining the break by attributing it to political disagreement . " What could be the matter with him ? " was the only line of questioningArthur took . He was quite willing , it seemed , to leave the Party as a fixed point from which all deviation implied something wrong with the person deviating . Not ever being at one with the Party was all right ; but deviation , after having been at one with the Party , was wrong . Arthur was a political man , but even for him the Party was not really political , and a break with it was not an action in politics  --  in practical politics , as people said , wishing to make a distinction between that unfortunate kind of politics and some other , better kind  --  but rather an action in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned him when he had mentioned Lenin 's view of the need for small groups of **27;1915;TOOLONG , asking him if he really thought that the Party was conspiratorial ? Yet Arthur had said that the affair of the secret letters had been Maxim 's business and therefore not to be inquired into . Then to confuse the matter further , why had Arthurfelt that because of the secrecy it was as well that the Crooms and Laskell had refused to be involved ? But Nancy was involved . Of that Laskell was sure . Why had she said yes ? Was it because she , like him , had been reared as a welllovedchild of the middle class , brought up on promises which had to be fulfilled ? If at first Laskell had been ambiguously frightened by his knowledge of what she had done , now , as he thought of her in the light of their common past , thought of her as the spirited girl in the genteel suburb to whom so much was promised and so much given , he had a kind of tenderness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , a fresh , young immediacy . John Laskell had never looked at the Grooms from so much distancebefore . But he found the distance by no means at final odds with his great affection for them . Quite the contrary , as the excitement of thought began to wane and sleep began to come , he thought of the Grooms with a new affection . They did not have the secret of life , of the perfectly simple character , but that only endeared them the more . Not until he saw that they did not have it was he aware that he had ever believed that they had had it . After this evening , Laskell and the Grooms did not of their own will revert to the story of Maxim . And perhaps , though that was doubtful , it would never have been mentioned again had it not forced itself upon them . It did so three days later . Laskell was at the Grooms in the afternoon and Nancy gave him his mail . She said as she handed it to him , " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said Laskell . He knew whom she meant , but he said , " Have I only the one ? " your Maxim , " Nancy said dryly . " My Maxim ? Surely as much yours as mine . Or as little mine as yours . " I saw the card , John . Really , Kermit Simpson is not a responsibleperson . And you must be held to blame too , you really must . " For the postcard bore the printed name of The New Era and on it Maxim had typed a brief message : " I greet you from my existtence . " He had both typed his name and signed it . There was an asterisk at the end of the single sentence of the message , and it referred to a footnote below . " A man , " the footnote read , " is the cause of existence but not the cause of essence of another man ( for the latter is an eternal truth ) : and so they can certainly agree in essence , but in existence they must differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them perish , that of the other does not consequently perish ; but if the essence of one of them could be destroyed or made false , the essence of the other must also be destroyed . Spin . Eth . Bk . I , Prop . XVII , note . " " Have you read it ? " Laskell said . " No . Of course I have n't read your mail . " " I 'm sure he meant you to read it . At any rate , you 've read enough for his purpose . You read his name and The New Era . You know , as he wanted you to know , that on a certain day in August Gifford Maxim wrote from the office of The New Era . I 'm sure he 's sending out as many postcards as he can . Here , read it . "  |p153She  took it as if it were dangerous or befouled . " What does it mean ? " she said when she had read it through . " Did we ever really know what Maxim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethics  --  I do n't know what he means to say by it . " This was not wholly true . But he spoke bitterly . He was angry with Maxim for this trick . He did not want to hear from Maxim on this presumption of friendship . He did not want the presumptionof friendship to be the pretext for the further establishment of Maxim 's monomaniac existence . So he would not let his mind rest on whatever meaning the card had . But he did not tear it up . He put it in his pocket . And then a few days later they had forced on them yet another evidence of Maxim 's existence and of his redoubtable efforts to establish it . The August issue of The New Era arrived for the Crooms and Gifford Maxim 's name was on the masthead . He appeared as an assistant editor . There was no announcement of his having joined the staff , simply the addition of his name to the names of the two young men who were also assistant editors . But on the cover was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Gifford Maxim . " This , no doubt , was the article , " the literary article , " that Maxim had waved at Laskell the day of his visit . Perhapsits inclusion in the issue was the reason for the issue 's being so late . And when the Grooms handed him The New Era in wry silence , Laskell felt enough connection with the article to admit that if they wanted to hold him to account for its publication , they had some justification . The New Era was a long , double-columned , rough-stock publication , similar in appearance to the American and English liberal weeklies , although Kermit Simpson made a point of saying that it had been modeled in format as in policy on the old Freeman . Maxim'sarticle ran to two pages , an unusual length for The New Era 's literary section . " Have you read it ? " Laskell said . " Not yet , " said Arthur . " No , " said Nancy . Laskell took it out to the lawn to read . It was an essay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melville 's Billy Budd , Fore/topman , a limited and costly edition . " It is now twelve years since the discovery and first publication of the masterpiece of Herman Melville 's old age . Yet even now Billy Budd is not generally known to American readers . " It began so , and Laskell thought that Maxim had established a new existence indeed : he wrote quite in the Anglican manner of Matthew Arnold and T. S. Eliot . But the older Maxim appeared in the next sentence : " The Porpentine Press has just brought out this great work in an edition scarcely calculated to give it wider currency . Five hundred copies on handmade , woven rag-paper at fifteen dollars a copy , the type hand-set and prim and self-conscious , and then distributed so as to insure the scarcity-value and snob-value of each of the numbered copies  --  thus does culture ' ape the values of the market-place . " It was not until much later that Laskell learned that all this was Maxim 's joke . There was no such edition of Billy Budd , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxim gave a few more sentences to the sins of the Porpentine Press and spoke sharply of the line-drawings which illustrated the book in , as he said , " a bad imitation of the worst manner of RockwellKent . " Then he launched into his subject . As Laskell read , he was filled with astonishment . He had never speculated on what views Maxim might come to hold and now that he had the opportunity to see what they were , it was almost unbelievable . Not unbelievablethat anyone should have them , but that Maxim should have them , and presumably not all of a sudden but developing them at a time when everyone believed him to be holding views exactly opposite . Because , as Maxim said , the story of Billy Budd was not well known , he undertook to tell it briefly . He established the great triangleof Billy Budd , Claggart , and Captain Vere  --  Billy Budd , The Handsome Sailor , the youth of so great a natural goodness that everyone loved him , and physically perfect except for the one flaw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Claggart , the master-at-arms of the English frigate , a fallen gentleman , the man of evil , who is drawn to goodness but envies and hates it ; and Captain Vere of the frigate Indomitable , " Starry " Vere , as he is called , the man of passionate but reasonable virtue , of intellect and duty , a captain potentially as great as Nei/son . Maxim quickly told the story of Claggart 's perverse persecutionof Budd , his denouncing Budd to the Captain for mutinous schemes , the Captain 's dislike of Claggart and his intuitive trust of Budd , the confrontation of Budd and Claggart in the Captain 's cabin , the accusation made , Budd 's confusion and anger rendering him incapable of speech , so that his answer had to be his blow on Claggart 's temple , Claggart 's falling dead and the Captain 's cry , " Struck dead by an angel of God . Yet the angel must hang . " Such is the goodness of the young sailor that even the small minds of the ship 's officers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Starry " Vere 's speech to them , in which , though torn by his paternallove for the young man , Vere argues for the necessity under law of condemning him to death . Maxim quoted the scene of the hanging at dawn , so that his readers might have the full force of it , Billy 's utterance , as the noose was around his neck , of his only words , " God bless Captain Vere ! " the words " delivered in the clear melody of a singing bird on the point of launching from the twig , " the massed ship's-company echoing the cry without volition and almost against its will , the Captain on the quarter-deck momentarilyparalyzed by the cry : and then the going aloft of Billy , which is made to appear as an ascension rather than a hanging , the sudden light in the sky and the hanged figure miraculously not twitching in its death-throes . " The modern mind , " Maxim wrote , " is not really capable of understandingthis story . I mean the modern mind in its most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For such people , Billy Budd will be nothing more than an oppressed worker , and a very foolish one , an insufficiently activated one , nothing more than a company man , ' weakly acquiescent to the boss . And Captain Vere will seem as at best but a conscience-ridden bourgeois , sympatheticto a man of the lower orders but committed to carrying out the behests of the established regime . " Melville , of course , intended no such understanding of the matter . The story is a political parable , but on a higher level than we are used to taking our political parables . It is the tragedy of Spirit in the world of Necessity . And more , it is the tragedy of Law in the world of Necessity , the tragedy that Law faces wheneverit confronts its child , Spirit . For Billy is nothing less than pure Spirit , and Captain Vere nothing less than Law in the world of Necessity . We have , of course , a story of God the Father , of Christ and of the Devil , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have said that Billy is pure Spirit , but that is not quite accurate . He is not wholly pure . He has a flaw , symbolized by his impedimentof speech . And he sins , despite the fact that the man against whom he directs his anger is Evil itself . His blow is given out of an impotence . " Yet , as Spirit , Billy is pure enough to make the tragedy of CaptainVere . Vere must rule the world of Necessity because Claggart  --  Evil  --  exists . The belief of the modern progressive is that Spirit should find its complete expression at once . Everything that falls short of the immediate expression of Spirit is believed to be an ignominious moral inadequacy . To such minds , Captain Vere is culpable because he does not acquit Billy in defiance of all Law . To them , Vere 's suffering at being unable to do so is a mere sentimentality . It is even an hypocrisy . The modern progressive believesthat he will not palter with anything less than perfection . He considers this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather the mark of his lack of belief in the truth and reality of Spirit . He can not believe in Spirit unless it is established in institutions . He can not believe that he really exists as Spirit unless he sees himself matched exactly in external forms . It is not the strength of the inner life that makes this demand . Rather it is the weakness of the inner life that will not tolerate any discrepancy between what Spirit can conceive and what Necessity can tolerate . Melville 's perceptionis that Spirit and the Law that is established in the world of Necessity are kin , yet discontinuous . It is not merely that Vere understands that Billy is his son , the Isaac to his Abraham ; it is that Billy understands that Vere is his father and blesses him in his last words . Spirit blesses Law , even when Law has put the noose around his neck , for Spirit understands the true kinship . " As long as Evil exists in the world , Law must exist , and it  --  not Spirit  --  must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his is the tragic choice of God the Father , who must condemn his own son to death . But not as in the familiar transaction of Christian theology , as a sacrifice and an atonement , but for the sake of the Sonp157himself , for the sake of Spirit in humanity . For Billy Budd is not only Christ , he is Christ in Adam , and is therefore imperfect , subject to excess . But we can not understand Vere 's suffering choice because we do not understand tragedy . And we do not understand tragedy because we do not understand love . " The essay did not stop there , but went on to speak at length of tragedy and love . It was as well that it did , for Laskell had found that he had been a little caught by Maxim 's words . One sentence in particular , in which Maxim spoke of the reign of Spirit being in the everlasting future , while modern men thought that they could establish it now , suited what Laskell had been thinking about the future . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using the words over and over again , the odor of corruption came to Laskell and freed him from any enchantment with Maxim 's mind . Tragedy and love , love and tragedy , tragedy depending on love , love dependingon tragedy : Maxim wove a crooning litany of the two words until Laskell felt an intellectual nausea and thought that there were two words that decency could not utter , however real were the things they represented . Perhaps only because Maxim spoke them , and spoke them so often , Laskell felt that never again could anyone say the words tragedy and love . He sat in the canvas deck chair and wondered how it was possible for a man who had once so loved freedom and the future to make so impassioned a plea , in the name of tragedy and love , for the status quo , the accepted thing , the rule of force . Maxim was no disaffected revolutionary . He was the blackest of reactionaries . He was not a man who had no party for his progressive but divergent ideas . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What do you make of it ? " Arthur said when Laskell brought The New Era back into the house . Laskell shrugged in impatience . " I do n't know . Read it yourself and see . " He felt at that moment a disgust for the whole world of ideas that allowed such shifts as Maxim 's to be made so easily . He wanted to be off by himself . The Crooms brought themselves to read the essay and their response to it surprised him . He himself could not understand it save as proof that Maxim had thrown over all his aims and hopes .   Maxim took pleasure in explaining that Spirit  --  as he called it  --  was not yet ready to establish its rule on earth . He meant that it would never establish its rule . Perhaps Maxim did not really believe in his own elaborate obfuscation , his vague religiosity that demanded an understanding of tragedy and the exercise of love and required events to stand still while " Spirit " perfected itself , which , of course , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more repulsive , a Maxim who really believed this or a Maxim who pretended to believe it because he thought he would be the safer if he made clear and absolute his difference with the Party . But the Crooms , oddly enough , did not feel as he did about the article . They certainly did not like it . " There 's an awful lot of sheer garbage in it , " Arthur said . " I never thought Giff would go off on that quasi-religious line . I thought he 'd organize a splinter group or go over to the Trotskyites . " And Nancy said , " That mysticalnonsense , it 's disgusting . " But they did not quite see eye to eye with Laskell when he spoke of the piece as reactionary . " If you think about it , " said Nancy , " you see that it is really quite applicable to the Moscow trials . Even if those men were subjectivelyinnocent  --  I mean even if they had good motives for what they did , like Budd  --  I do n't believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may have had to be executed for the sake of what he calls Law in the world of Necessity . And you remember how they all concurred in their punishment and seemed almost to want it . Certainlybefore they died they had a proper appreciation of Law . They realized that the dictatorship of the proletariat represented Law . Of course , God was n't mentioned , but it was the same thing in effect and they said that their punishment was necessary . No , I think you 're wrong , John , in the way you 've read the article . Do n't misunderstand me  --  I 'm sure he 's insane , but that makes it all the more surprising how much insight he still has . " And Nancy 's voice had now a touch of sorrow , a touch of pity for Maxim that she had not been able to muster before . Arthur said , " Yes , there 's a certain amount of real insight in it . I do n't mean that business about God or all that talk about tragedy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that come to the fore , it makes some real sense . You find a good many people these days who think things can be made perfect overnight , that aP159revolution insures a Utopia in an instant , without difficulty and trouble , without compromise and without the use of force . Mind you , I have n't any sympathy with the article , but it does have a core of realism . The great danger to the progressive movement these days , as I see it , is that liberals are going to confuse their dreams and ideals with the possible realities . You see that happeningalready  --  people become disappointed and disaffected because everything is n't the way they would like to have it . They see economicdemocracy developing over there and that does n't satisfy them  --  they begin shouting for immediate political democracy , forgetting the realities of the historical situation . Yes , Maxim in this respect has more sense in him than I thought he would have . Peoplewho break usually do n't have that much sense . " Laskell thought that perhaps , some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not defend his own reading of it . " Perhaps you 're right , " he said . He thought too that some time he would consider why Arthur had looked at him with a special , personal intensity as he made that rather long speech of his and a certain stubbornness that Arthur 's whole body seemed to be expressing.  | " And did those feet in ancient timeWalk upon England 's mountains green ? ' " When she mentioned feet Susan Caldwell 's hand swept down to indicate her feet . When she referred to mountains , it swept upward and suggested a mountain . " And was the holy Lamb of God ' "  --  and now with cradling arms and downward gazing eyes she indicated a lamb and its tendercare  --  " On England 's pleasant pastures seen ? ' " Her widely separating hands suggested both the extent of the pastures and the breadth of the question . Laskell , holding the book , was appalled . But he had already questioned her twice and did not like to do it again . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifting vaguely up and down the Folgers ' lawn , looking at the upper windows , carrying in her arms  --  in much the same way she was to " carry " the Lamb  --  the big book . He came down to her , thinking that she might possibly want him , and it turned out that she had come on a visit to him . The visit was not wholly social . Or at least she did not present it as wholly social . She wanted Laskell to " hear " the poem she was to recite at the Bazaar . But her intention to make use of him did not diminish and even increased the odd little flattery of the visit . They sat down on the lawn together and Laskell addressed himself very seriously to the duty she had imposed upon him . She handed him the book . It was a big college anthology of English literature . She opened to the place marked by a slip of paper and gave him the volume at a double page of Blake 's songs . " Which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pointed to one of the poems on the page . It was not a Song of Innocence or a Song of Experience , but the four stanzas that Blake had prefixed to Milton . " Why are you reciting this one ? " Laskell asked . " Is it wrong ? " said Susan , her eyes wide . " Wrong ? Oh , no . I just wanted to know why . " She explained . " For the entertainment we can each do anything we want . It 's a very informal entertainment . One of the girls is goingto play the piano and render the Parade of the Wooden Soldiers . ' Did you ever hear that piece ? " " Yes , I have , " Laskell said . " And one is going to sing . And I 'm going to recite this poem . Mother read me a lot of poems and I liked this one . She said I could choose one I liked . I liked this one . So I chose it . " The logic could not have been clearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an easy poem to recite because of the gestures . It has a lot of gestures . " " Gestures ? " But Laskell was not so young that he could pretend to ignorance of the tradition of recitation with expression and gestures . He said , " Oh , I see . " And now Susan took her stance . But first she shook herself from the shoulders , her wrists loose . She agitated them violently and very seriously , as if she were giving herself over to the uncontrollablespasms of a dreadful neurological disorder . " Goodness , Susan ! " said Laskell . " Why are you doing that ? " " It 's so my arms will hang loose and naturally by my sides . Mother taught me to do it . " " But you wo n't do it in public , when you recite ? " " Of course not , " said Susan , mildly surprised by his stupidity . " I 'm just practicing . " She thrust her left foot forward and put her weight on it . She tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their condition . When she had finished the first stanza , she said , ' Was that right ? " " Yes , " said Laskell . " Perfect . " He meant that she was word-perfect . He was not referring to the larger aesthetic question . She undertook the second stanza on the same system of gesture. 162 THE MIDDLE OF THE JOURNEY And did the Countenance Divine Shine forth upon our clouded hills ? And was Jerusalem builded here Among these dark Satanic Mills ? ' " She made a graceful reference to her own face to suggest the Countenance Divine . Her hands came forth in a wide delta to indicate the Countenance in the act of shining forth upon the clouded hills . There was a complex upward movement of two hands to show Jerusalem being builded here . And then there was an even more complex flutter to indicate not only the Mills but also her revulsion from their dark Satanic quality . This time she did not interrupt herself at the end of the stanza , but , having paused weightily , went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bring me my Arrows of desire : Bring me my Spear : 0 clouds unfold. ! Bring me my Chariot of fire . ' " With each " Bring " she reached out like a stage magician , snatchingthings from the air to astonish her audience . She grasped the bow and arrows appropriately , and in the very act of grasping them , fitted at least one arrow to the bow . She seized the spear and , still holding it in her right hand , well out from her body in warlike fashion , she seized the reins of the chariot of fire in her left hand and leaned forward to meet the wind of the chariot 's speed . She was now fully equipped to utter her declaration of war . She came out of the crouch that was necessary for the control of the speeding chariot and stood upright . " ' I will not cease from Mental Fight "  --  And she stamped her foot in a passion of refusal . " Hold it ! " said Laskell . She stopped and looked at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you stamp your foot ? " " To show I mean it . " " I do n't think you ought to do that . " ' Why not ? " she said in reasonable surprise . " Because it 's as if you were a child being stubborn . And I don'tTHEp163think you ought to say , I will not cease '  --  you ought to say , I will not cease , ' all on a level : I will not cease . ' " She fully considered the criticism and also the really great complimentthat was bound up with it . Then she said , " But I am a child , really . " It was certainly a point . Laskell thought about it . " Yes , " he said . " But you have n't said any other part of the poem as if you were a child , and then suddenly , just at the end , when the poem gets so determined , you change the character of the speaker . " She took it in very thoughtfully and was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry he had raised any objectionat all . The manner she had devised  --  or more likely , been taught  --  was of course absurd , but he had no right to correct it . Elocution with expression would scarcely be under the same reprobationat this country function that it might have been in other circumstances . And yet Susan was so simple and so alight with intelligence that he did not want her to diminish herself by this absurd manner . " I 'm sorry , Susan , " Laskell said . " I should n't have interfered . You go on and do it your own way . " " No , " said Susan . " If it is n't right , it is n't right . " " No , really . It 's all right . Just go ahead and say it the way you always do . " " No , " said Susan with a final firmness . " Let me try . " She took her public stance again , her left foot forward , her knee slightly bent , her weight on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' No . Wrong ! I will not cease . I will not cease . ' There ! I will not cease from Mental Fight . ' Is that right ? " " Yes . Fine . " " I will not cease from Mental Fight . ' " She smiled at him and he smiled back . " Good , " he said with an odd little satisfaction . " Now go on . " " ' I will not cease from Mental Fight . ' " A little frown appeared on her forehead . " And ' "  --  she began and cast about for the next line . " ' Nor , ' " Laskell prompted . " ' Nor shall my Sword " She looked blank for a moment . " Oh , yes . Nor shall my Sword sleep in my hand . " She held her hand forward and to the side ,  | clutching the unsleeping sword . Then she raised it before her , reaching it high . " ' Till we have built JerusalemIn England 's green and pleasant Land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked to Laskell for his word . " Very good , " he said . " Very good indeed . " " You really think so ? " she said with the artist 's everlasting dubietywhich , when voiced , is half real and half insincere . " Oh , beautiful , " he said . His sincerity came not from his admirationof the " rendition " of the poem but from the amusement he felt at her puckered and hesitant face as she canvassed the true value of her performance . " Beautiful ! " she said with the childish scorn that expresses childishembarrassment at a really big word of praise . " Truly , " he said . " Oh pooh ! " was her answer , with an awkward movement of her shoulders to fight off the voluptuous sensations of sudden praise . " Beautiful  --  pooh ! " And she sat down . He lightly tapped her twice on the head with the big book . " Do n't you make fun of Inc , " he said . " Do n't you make fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had come for a particular purpose , to have him hear her rehearse , but now that her purpose was accomplished , she did not go . " What poems do you know ? " she said . She simply assumed that if she knew poems by heart , he must know poems by heart . And , as it happened , she was not wrong . He had once been made to memorize ten sonnets in a course in college . He was perfectly willingto recite them for her . He recited " Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments , " and " When to the sessions of sweet silent thought , " finding them in the book so that she could check on his accuracy . He recited " Since there 's no help , come let us kiss and part , " and " When I consider how my light is spent , " and " The world is too much with us , " and " Earth has not anything to show more fair . " She followed each of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know everything , " she said when he stopped.  | " Well , not so much as that , " he said with a modesty that was wholly fatuous . He said , " Are n't you going swimming today ? " He had often seen Susan and Emily coming up the road on clear afternoonswith towels and wet hair . " No , " she said , a little bitterly . " Mother decided not to . " " Where is your mother ? " The question was really a rude one , but Susan and her mother were almost always seen together , like a foal and a mare . The question of where Susan 's mother was was not quite so important as where her father was , for Duck Caldwell had vanished for the past three days . This was not so unusual as to cause concern , but it made some trouble for the Grooms , for Duck had left a job of plastering half done . " Mother 's getting water at the Korzinskis ' , " . Susan said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , but today she said I should n't . She said I should come and have you hear my poem . " It took something from the pleasure of Susan 's visit that she had not thought of it herself , but it did not take as much from it as Laskellmight have expected . " I can speak some Polish . The Korzinskis taught me . " She spoke some Polish . " Good-by , thank you very much for your kindness . " " Good-by , Susan . You 're very welcome . " " No  --  that 's what it means , that 's what the Polish means . Then they say to me , Panyenka '  --  that means young lady  --  " She said a sentence in Polish . " And that means You 're welcome . ' " Is it far to the Korzinskis ' ? " " Not very . Mr. Croom asked us to get the water at his house , but Mother says it would hurt the Korzinskis ' feelings . Anyway , Mother says that she and Mrs. Croom are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a cozy relationship possible only to adults . After this first visit with its particular purpose , Susan paid Laskellseveral visits with no purpose at all . He would look out of his window when he was working on the planned cities of antiquity and see her on the Folgers ' lawn , walking slowly up and down , or sitting with her legs tucked under her . He understood , recollectingit from his boyhood , that she was in that terrible state of children  --  she " had nothing to do "  --  and he would come down to talk to her . When the friendship had progressed a little , she ventured beyond waiting to be noticed and took to calling up to his window , " Mr. Laskell , are you busy ? " They played a good deal of mumblety-peg . The three hounds , with their impulse to sociability , always came to sit close to them during Susan 's visits and had to be safeguarded from any mischanceof the knife . Laskell and Susan thought it unfriendly to chase the hounds and before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the scruff of his neck and urge and drag him to a safe distance . They used Laskell 's old stag-handled pocket-knife . Susan knew the first passages of the game and was fairly good at them  --  the knife thrown from its cradled position in the clenched fist , the knife tossed up from the open palm . She knew the finger-flips but she did not know over-the-fence . Laskell taught it to her and she became quite good at it . From there on it became pretty much Laskell 's game . Susan conceived a great admiration for his skill , and she herself acquired a growing adeptness . She read a good deal . For all her devotion to ' the life of art and her choice of the Blake poem , she read chiefly comic books . She said that her mother did not approve of her reading them . She could not have been given as many dimes as she had books , but despite the scarcity of children in the neighborhood and Susan 's rather unhappy distance from the few who were within reach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the young which saw to it that these documents were circulated and fell into the right hands . She herself had no great respect for these books but she had an addiction . The growing friendship with Susan naturally developed the acquaintanceship with Susan 's mother . He often met the two on the road or before their house , and since now he had to stop to chat with Susan , he had also to chat with Emily Caldwell . These more frequent meetings dimmed his recollection of how she had first appeared to him , as well as his sense of her foolishness that eveningat the Crooms ' . She began to take her place in the commonplace , the quite pleasant commonplace , as the mother of a little girl he was fond of . And through Susan , as it were , the same thing happened to her father . Laskell met Duck face to face one day after one of the visits had come to an end and he was walking top167the Crooms ' . Susan was walking with him to her own house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little guilty , walking with the man 's own child , but it made a condition of friendlinessthat had to be recognized and he said , " Hello ! " and Duck answered , " Hi ! " " Susan has just been paying me a visit , " Laskell said . " What do you want to bother people for ? " Duck said to Susan . It was much what most fathers would have said under the circumstances . There was no exception to be taken to it . " She has n't bothered me , I enjoyed it . " " Well , " said Duck dubiously . If Laskell did not quite like a too-long , too-objective stare that Duck gave his daughter and a certain constriction of Susan 's recentlyexpansive being , that was probably only imagination . It was enough of a meeting to make a country acquaintanceship , even though an acquaintanceship in dislike , and thereafter when Laskellwas at the Crooms ' he called a greeting to Duck and they even talked about the problems of the reconstruction of the house . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm the truce that had been established between Laskell and the Grooms since the evening he had told the story of Maxim . That evening had been the first expressed tension between them . But tensions are elements of friendship and on the whole they were as gay with each other as they had ever been . Nevertheless the tension was there , and Laskell , for his part , pulled on his end of the rope . He pulled firmly but all his feeling went into the pull itself  --  he was not annoyed with the Crooms and he made no reservationsin his relationship with them . He knew that there was a difference between them and he felt better when he kept himself aware of it . were now to have said to him as she once had , " I think you have a prejudice against Duck , " he would have answered with a cheerful grimness , " I certainly have . " Now , when they talked about Duck , he put in his protest ; and when they depreciated Emily in Duck 's favor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest . He did not admire Emily Caldwell but her good looks pleased him , he liked her cleanly sturdy quality and found that if he had to think , which he did not really like to do , of the juxtaposition of Emily and her husband , there was a certain rightness in standing up for Emily . The Grooms looked at him oddly for this open declaration of Caldwell partisanship . They may have thought that it had something to do with their judgment of Laskell on the Maxim evening , as of course it had . After a while the Grooms gave up talking about the Caldwells almost entirely . That lessened the strain considerably and things went on gaily until Nancy 's picnic . Nancy and Arthur had agreed on a picnic , but they had had some difficulty coming to an agreement on what kind of picnic it should be . Arthur had the modern idea of a picnic and it was essentiallymasculine in nature . What he wanted was a thick steak and roasted corn and coffee , all made on the spot . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she called an old-fashionedpicnic . She wanted exactly what Arthur said he wished to avoid  --  dozens of well-made sandwiches wrapped in wax paper , hard-boiled eggs , tomatoes , and perhaps a jar of little pickles , a big cake . As for coffee , that might be made on the spot , although she would actually prefer to take it in the big thermos bottle . It was Nancy 's kind of picnic that they were to have . It became clear to Arthur as well as to Laskell that the picnic had a special meaning to Nancy . Perhaps she had an image of her mother sitting on a steamer rug , the basket by her side , urging sandwiches on the family around her . Arthur groaned and spoke of ants and spiders , but he gave way and Nancy boiled her chicken and chilled it and stripped it and made it into her sandwiches which she neatly wrapped in wax paper . They had the pickles and the tomatoes , and the coffee in the big thermos . Nancy took the picnic very seriously and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that she could supervise the baking of a large cocoanut layer cake . They were to leave at eleven to drive the short distance to a place the Grooms knew of . There the river widened out handsomelyand there was a bit of sandy beach for Micky to play on . They had a good day , bright and cool , and Laskell , as he came up , saw that the expedition was already organized . There was a pile of rugs and blankets on the porch , the thermos jug with Micky 's lunch , the pair of thermos bottles in their case , Arthur 's large cameraand the big wicker hamper . Nancy must have had the picnicp169long in mind to have brought this hamper from the city with so much else . It was an imposing old hamper . From the look of it , it was fitted inside with plates and forks and knives , and it spoke , somehow , of a rich , vanished day when a large hamper was part of the equipment of a family in easy circumstances . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her grandparents . There was no one on the lawn save Susan Caldwell and Micky Croom . Susan had made a handkerchief doll and she talked to it with animation and made it answer back with an agitated wagging of its head and a dancing of its loose cotton legs . Micky was followingwith great interest what the pair of them were saying . It gave Laskell pleasure to know that Susan was going with them . At last everything was ready . Eunice came out and picked up Micky and held him in her arms over her shoulder so as to have him ready to get into the car when the moment came . He did not want to leave the fascinating dialogue between Susan and the handkerchief doll . So Susan tried to continue the game while he squirmed in Eunice 's arms and looked over Eunice 's shoulder . " ' I will not cease from Mental Strife , ' " she made the doll say in a high thin voice , waving its cotton arm. will not cease , " she said in a deeper voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease , ' " will not cease , ' " " ' I will not cease , ' " will not cease . " Back and forth waged the war of emphasis and Micky began to kick with pleasure . She was a complicated child , for she was doing three things at once and each of them wholeheartedly . She was amusing Micky and flirting with Laskell and mocking Eunice . Eunice certainly did not like what was going on behind her back for she turned and faced Micky in another direction , casually and as if without purpose . Susan circled so as to come face to face with him again and continued her game . She went too far , for Eunice , after she had turned the child twice more with silent forbearance , swung about and said to Susan , " Oh , for God 's sake ! Cut it out , will you ? " Susan stopped short in her game , looking rather chilled and scared . Nancy and Arthur came out looking very spruce , as if they had every intention of honoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and Eunice at once got in with Micky.  | Arthur and Laskell stored all the paraphernalia in the trunk . Nancy took her place in front . When everything was quite ready and the rest of them were about to get into the car , Nancy said with the air of calamity which picnics generate , " Oh , Lord , Micky 's sweater ! I left it on the table . " And leaning out of the window , she said to Susan , " Would you get it for me , Susan , like a dear ? It 's a red sweater . " " Yes , I will , " said Susan and dashed toward the house . She came out with the little red sweater and Nancy said , " Thank you , Susan . " It was not the tone that is used to a member of the expedition , a sharer of the adventure . Arthur slipped into his seat at the wheel , Laskell got in beside Eunice . It was Laskell 's task to close the door of the car , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's exclusion . " Have a nice time , " Susan said to them all , and did not have a sufficient impulse of self-protection to run off before the car started , on business of her own , but stood and waited for them to leave her . " We should have taken her , " Laskell said . " It would have been nice , " said Nancy turning in her seat . " Mais la jeune fille ici  --  la bonne  --  n'aime pas la petite . Ce serait une occasion tres desagreable si nous avions les deux ensemble . " The drive was a short one . They parked the car by the side of the road and went across a field , Arthur carrying Micky seated on his shoulder , Laskell carrying the hamper and the thermos jug , Eunice carrying the thermos-bottle case , Nancy carrying the rugs . The spot they came to was quite perfect for a picnic . They spread the heavy steamer rug under a tree on soft , feathery grass . The bank fell away sharply to the little beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they set him there with Eunice and his big dump-truck which he did not yet quite know how to control and a kitchen spatula for a shovel . The river took a wide curve here and the sun was full on it . No place could better have established the picnic mood , which is a thing of art and ritual in which we celebrateour conquest of the fears of nature and pay our respects to the old life now that it no longer holds any terror for us . Arthur , who had campaigned against Nancy 's idea of a picnic , mockingpI7Iand teasing it , now led them in the mood . When once Micky was established with Eunice on the sand and the rugs were spread , he opened the hamper and took out a flask of whisky . It was a flask suited to the hamper and must have come from the same owners , for it was of heavy glass with its bottom sheathed in pewter ; this pewter sheath was removable and could be used as a cup ; the top was cased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laskell jumped down to the river and filled two enamel cups with water and they sat and drank whisky and water . And shortly their appetiteswere so high that the hamper had to be opened . Micky was brought up from the little beach and established among them with Eunice to oversee his eating . She herself , with an ungenial tolerance , ate what was urged on her . They were drinking coffee and smoking when Duck appeared . He came along the bank through the brush that bordered it and in his hand he carried a string of fish . His appearance startled them , but he had seen them from a distance and his face reflected the knowledge of their presence . Arthur said , " Hello , Duck . Where in the name of the Lord have you been ? " " Yes , where have you been ? " said Nancy . " We were worried . " " Oh , just been , " said Duck . " Hello , Eunie , " he said and he made a pass at her face with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerked back her head and expressed a settled disgust . Laskell , to have something to say , said , " You caught a lot of trout . " Duck held them up for his own inspection . " These ? " he said , as if a little surprised that he should have them . He looked at them coldly , without approval . " Will you have some cake and coffee , Duck ? " Nancy said . " Do n't mind , " Duck answered . He sat down with them , laying the fish on the grass . He ate his cake and drank his coffee while Nancy watched him with satisfaction . But after only half the cake was eaten , he put it aside . With his coffee cup poised on the way to his mouth , he said to Laskell , " You a fisherman , Mr. Laskell ? That rod and creel they got at their house , Mrs. Croom says is yours . " And he took a swallow of coffee.  | " Not much of a fisherman  --  not a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could . Ile had heard a latent intention in Duck 's voice that had put him on guard . Nancy said , " You have n't fished at all yet , John . Duck will have to take you to show you the good places . " " You a fly man maybe ? " Duck said . Here was the intention . Laskell knew exactly how Duck wanted this conversation to go . He knew it with the insight of his dislike of Duck . Step by slow step Duck would disclose his opinion of the sport of taking trout on a fly . It was an old American joke  --  the expensively equipped fisherman with the empty creel meets the barefoot boy with the old fish-pole and a heavy string of fish . Laskell 's friends shared the joke whenever they knew he was going fishing . Somehow the joke was pointed in the direction of democraticsimplicity . Often it went with an admiration of folk-art and a dislike of trained singing . It suddenly occurred to Laskell that Duck did not have even a fish-pole with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies . Do you ? " Duck thrust his head forward and made several little movementswith it , quite openly comical , suggesting but not uttering the quizzical answer of , " You might say yes , you might say no . " He was not telling , he had his secret . " Duck does n't make a religion of his fishing , " Nancy explained . " If he wants fish , he gets fish . " " I used to use flies now and then , " Duck said judiciously . " But like Mrs. Croom says , if I want fish , I get fish . Sometimes a worm gets them best , and then sometimes you spear them , and then sometimes you seine them . Those little bought flies cost more than a fish is worth to a man in my position , not to mention all the trouble . " Ile was looking at Laskell with wide , innocent eyes . " Of course , if you want to get yourself a really big mess of fish in a hurry , you take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw all the strange subtlety in his face . Duck was conscious of what he was doing . He knew that to certain ears his description of the way he fished would be like explaining his way of raping virgins . He was assuming that Laskell was a loftily dedicated fisherman . But Laskell was a very simple fisherman . He knew about the elaborations of the elegant businessp173of taking trout on a fly , but he had always been indifferent to them . Now , however , something more than the art of angling was in question . The Crooms must have caught the note of challengein Duck 's voice , for they had suddenly become alert . Nancy said , " You must remember that not everyone is in the favored position of choosing ways and means  --  there are people who need the fish for food . " Her words were as pedantic as his were to be . They sounded like learned counsel on opposing sides . " Yes , " he said , " but some of the poorest people I 've known have been the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had respect for the fish and they found pleasure in the sport and liked to give the fish a fighting chance . " He should have known the effect this would have on Nancy . Perhaps he had known it and was pushing things as far as they would go . " Now that , " said Nancy , " is sheer snobbery  --  the fanciest kind of snobbery . I suppose that the fish really likes the whole business and finds it very sporting too . " " No . We ca n't assume that . " With her eyebrows and a quirk of her head , Nancy made a gesture of large ironic surprise at his admitting so much . It was such a schoolgirl gesture of intellectual triumph that Laskell could not suppose it unfriendly . He met it with a smile , but he received no smile in answer . It struck him that the conversation about Ferdinandthe bull and the showing of Elizabeth 's picture , his telling them the story of Maxim  --  all these incidents bore belated fruit in that gesture . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't assume that the fish likes it . But the sport at least limits itself . The line is light , the leader is tapered very thin , the hooks are small , and some fishermen even use hooks without barbs to make the risk of losing the fish even greater . You set limitations , and if you overstep them , the pleasure is gone . " " How very romantic ! " " No , " he said heavily . Suddenly he did not feel clever enough to handle the situation he had created and he wished he had never started . " Not romantic . It 's a tendency that human life has  --  " But he stopped . He was embarrassed by having used the wordpI74 life . He finished his sentence lamely . "  --  to make certain demands on itself beyond its obvious needs . " Nancy said , " I do n't know what that means . " " It makes requirements and sets limits to itself , " said Laskell . " What does ? " It was dreadful to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Life , " he said . " It sets limits and it insists on acting within them . " He passionately wished he knew what he was talking about  --  that is , knew it to explain , not just to feel . He reached out blindly and said , " It 's like making sonnets . " That really seemed to help and he went on . " You set the pattern , a difficult pattern , and the effect comes from conforming to it . And when you conform to it successfully , you overcome it and it serves your purpose . " All his effort had produced nothing more than this old , worn paradox ! " Conforming to it , indeed ! " There was a full contempt in Nancy'semphasis . She said , " You sound positively feudal . " And then she said , " Sonnets ! " She had no special dislike of that verse form , and it was not sonnetsshe was holding in such contempt but the very idea of conforming . It was a little confusing , for he remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relative leniency with which she had spoken about the Commissars who had confessed and , at the end , had cried " God bless Captain Vere ! " And yet that confusion strangely enlightened him  --  that confusion in which Nancy both admired conformity and despised it . For he saw that Nancy 's feeling was not about conforming or not conforming , not about freedom or submission . It was a feeling about human nature , a profound dissatisfaction with the way human beingshad ever been , some leap of her imagination toward some way she hoped they would be . He could not understand why Nancy , who had been so fortunate at the hands of human nature , who had been so much cherished and so much admired , should have this dissatisfaction at the root of her political feelings . And he could not understand why Duck should be , as Laskell guessed he was , the model of the human nature that would be achieved by truly progressive action. pI75Nancy , having once said " Sonnets ! " now said it again , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time . " Sonnets ! " she said , and she let her gaze fall on Duck Caldwell , as if , after having for too long listened to fantasy , she were now consulting reality . And in her gaze there was , together with her reassurance of herself , the pity she felt for Duck . The dispute had long since passed out of Duck 's hands . Nancy said , " At this point in the world 's history ! " She said no more , but Armageddon was in her voice . Arthur saw that his wife and his friend were in crisis . He said , " I think that what Nancy means , John  --  " but he had begun his explanation after Laskell had begun to speak . What Laskell said was , " Since there 's no help , come let us kiss and part . ' " Nancy 's eyes went wide and her face went white . Laskell heard but did not understand the gasp of her suddenly intaken breath . " Nay , I have done , you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . It was one of the sonnets he had recited for Susan . And then all at once he saw what was happening , that Nancy had supposed that the first line of Michael Drayton 's poem was John Laskell 's own declaration . Her wide eyes , her sudden paleness , her sharply indrawn breath showed that she thought he had announced the end of their friendship . Laskell spoke the rest of the poem as fast as possible . He rather rattled out the lines , exaggerated his manner , made it unmistakablyclear that he was speaking from someone else 's impulse , not from his own , that he meant only to cite an example . But even as he was hurrying through the poem , he understood not only that Nancy had taken it to be himself speaking , but also that he had chosen this poem of parting from among all the sonnets he knew by heart because he and she were so opposed to each other . He reached the last couplet with its offer of the last saving chance for Love gasping on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all have given him over , From death to life thou might'st him yet recover . " ' He added in an effort of self-burlesque , " Orthodox sonnet of the Shakespearean type . " But his voice was tired and even now he could not exclude all earnestness from it as he said , " And I hopep176that explains the principle of fishing for trout to the young lady in the back row , and if it does n't , she can see me after class . " He was trying to throw the whole matter away , as far from them as he could . He received as reward Nancy 's rather bleak smile of recognition . And certainly their mood returning from the picnic was not as gay as their mood in setting out . That was of course to be expected of any picnic , more to be expected of a picnic than of any other social event . As ritual , a picnic has too much actuality in it to be satisfying for very long after its beginning , and not enough awarenessof its ritualistic intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the inevitable last mood of picnics the feeling that existed among them as they collected the trash of their meal and folded the rugs and made their way over the field back to the car . Nancy and he had compounded their quarrel for the moment . But they had not yet said what they were quarreling about . Therefore they could not compound their quarrel fully . On the Croom lawn the next day Arthur was surrounded by cans of paint , of oil , of turpentine . Laskell watched him as he poured white paint into a bucket , added linseed oil , stirred it deeply , and let the mixture drip from the stirring-stick . He dipped a brush , pressed out the excess paint against the side of the bucket , and lightly brushed over a clapboard of the house . The new white streak glistened in the sunlight against the suddenly gray-white of the old paint . Arthur looked critically at the streak and then called , " Oh , Duck ! " There was no answer . A strong steady hammering began inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called again , " Oh , Duck ! " There was no answer and the hammering took up again . Then it stopped and a voice said , " Yes , what is it ? " Arthur said , " Come out here a minute , Duck , and look at this , will you ? " The hammering began again . Arthur stood over the paint bucket and waited . Duck Caldwell came out with his hammer in his hand , dark and compact , with a little lurch in his walk , like an engaging boy swagp177gering off a piece of mischief . Arthur said , " Duck , will you tell me if this paint is all right ? " Duck looked into the paint pot . He contemplated it a long time . The two other men said nothing while he peered into the white depths . Duck took the stick , stirred the paint about , and let it drip from the lifted stick . Then he took the brush , dipped it , and laid a streak on the clapboard above Arthur 's streak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured a little more oil , stirred again , and held up the stick for Duck to see the rate of drip . Duck nodded . " Plenty , " he said with judicious finality . He started back into the house with his hammer , but at the door he turned and said , " Going to paint out the green cornerboards , Mr. Groom ? " His voice had suddenly a note of respectfulness , even of deference . But there was a double meaning in his smile . Arthur looked up from stirring the paint . " No , " he said in a very cool voice . Laskell caught something in the interchange and wondered what it meant . He sat down in a canvas chair and watched his friend at work . Arthur handled the brush well , covering a section of the clapboard quickly , working the paint into the overhang of each clapboard , picking up the surplus , smoothing out with light swift strokes . After working for a while in silence , Arthur turned and said , " Funny how this sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Laskell said . It gave him satisfaction to see his friend working , and he was glad of their friendship . " Would you like to try ? " Arthur said . " I have another brush . " " Tom Sawyer stuff , " Laskell jeered . But he was drawn to it . " Yes , I 'd like to try , " he said . Arthur went and got the other brush and poured off a quantity of the mixed paint into a small pot . They worked side by side for a while . After a polite interval , Arthur stopped and looked at Laskellpainting . He watched for a moment and said , " You do it very well . " And then he said , " Here , take this brush and give me yours . You 'll like it better . " " This one is all right , " Laskell said . It was not a very good brush , it was stubby and stiff , but it got the paint on.  | " No  --  that 's just an old brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good one . You 'll have more fun with it . " Laskell took the brush and Arthur waited while he tried it . It was almost uncanny the difference the new brush made . It seemed to have mind in it  --  to know what it was for and to want to fulfill its purpose . It was like having a living thing in his hand as he felt the bristles against the clapboard . He turned to Arthur and acknowledgedthe great difference . " It 's a wonderful brush , " he said . " God-damned expensive , " said Arthur proudly . It was an oddly gratifying kind of work and it took more skill and attention than one would suppose . But beneath the attention he had to give , Laskell felt a glow of relationship to Arthur . They did not talk but now and then they made curt comments to each other on the progress or the problems of the job . They fell into the same rhythm of painting and occasionally paused to inspect each other 's work with the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you get that crack of Duck 's ? " Laskell said , " What crack ? " " About painting out the cornerboards . He was ribbing me . He 's a shrewd article . He knew that Nancy and I had a disagreement . I wanted to paint the cornerboards white but she wants them left green . It 's crazy , it spoils the shape of the house but Nancy wants it that way . All the houses in this part of the country have green cornerboards . " The Croom house was very small and very simple , a box of a house , but with a very happy proportion between length and height . The green cornerboards , by outlining the white walls , made the house smaller and needlessly emphatic and less elegant than if they had continued the white of the walls . " Look better all white , " said Laskell . This elliptical form of his own speech surprised him and he sought in his mind for its reason . He found it in the manner that boys use when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or technicians . He remembered the flow of male affection that used to be expressedin such play , the warmth that was hidden and expressed by the brisk , masculine language of cooperation . He spoke so again . " Look a good deal better all white . " " Of course , " said Arthur . " Nancy admits it . But she says we can'tp179be different from the rest . She says it would make us just summer people if we brought in our own notions of how things should be done . " " But you are summer people , after all . " " We are now . But suppose I lose my job ? We could come up here and make out . At least as long as Nancy 's little income lasts . " " Lose your job ? " Laskell said in alarm . " Has something hap-pened ? " Arthur 's university career had been rapid and rewarding as such careers go , and Laskell had always supposed that now it could only improve . But in addition to alarm , he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make liquid to offer the Crooms as a loan . " No , nothing 's happened , " Arthur said dubiously . " But the way things are going . I 've been mixed up in a few things and it is n't doing me much good with the university administration . " Laskell was relieved but a little disappointed . As the warmth of his impulse to help the Grooms was taken from him , he felt a little annoyed that he had responded so quickly to the Grooms ' fantasy of danger . He remembered the esteem in which Arthur was held and the talk about the Washington appointment . He should not have said as lightly as he did say , " Your only danger is that they 'll decide to make you a dean or something . " Arthur looked remote and hurt and then angry , and Laskell realized he had done wrong in refusing him his place at the center of the drama of these troubled times . But as a matter of fact what had been increasingly interesting Laskell about his friend was how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things got a good deal worse , Arthur Groom was wonderfully suited to the world . He was not a man of the ultimate future , though he borrowed a little from the ultimate future ; Arthurwas a man of the immediate future , one of the men who might effectually make a go of things , for a while . Yet Laskell knew that he could not advance this view of Arthur against the Grooms ' own view of themselves living an enforced life of subsistencein their pretty house . Arthur did not have a chance to argue the possibility , for Nancy came out and stood behind the two men and said , " Danger : Intel/lectuals at work ! A very gratifying spectacle , I must say . You do it well too , John . " " Oh , I do , do I ? " Nancy took a chair and sat down in an extreme attitude of luxuriousleisure . " Let me see what it feels like to just sit while you men work . What have you been talking about ? " Arthur said over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has just been telling me that I 'm likely to be made dean . I 'm in such favor with the administration . " " There 's as much chance of that as that you 'll lose your job , " Laskell said . " I do n't know about that . " Arthur spoke as if he had some secret knowledge . " You 're wrong , John , " Nancy said simply . " Arthur is on every committee of protest and the students are always coming to him to sign things and speak at their meetings . He 's by no means safe . " There was so little question of it in Nancy 's mind that there was nothing more to say . She looked at her husband with admiration . She wanted a life of danger and morality and she loved Arthur for his help in supplying it . The connection between Arthur and Laskell was broken . But it would have been broken by Nancy 's having come out to join them . Or it would have been broken by their having finished painting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ladder . He set the ladder against the roof and was about to go up to hook on the paint pot when Susan Caldwell came up the path to them . In her hand she had a little bundle of letters . Emily Caldwell called from the road , " We met the mailman and brought you your mail . " Susan went to Arthur with the mail and he put down the pot of paint and took the letters from her . " Thank you , Susan , " he said . There was a letter for Nancy and he gave it to her , reaching it out to her absently as he read a postcard for himself . ' Well , " he said , " here 's a business ! " Nancy opened her letter . " What 's a business ? " she said . " This is from Kermit Simpson . He 's driving up and wants to stop over with us . " " That 's nice , " said Nancy absently , reading her letter.  |p181Laskell  could see from Arthur 's face that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has Gifford Maxim with him , " Arthur said . Nancy did not put aside her letter at once . But when she did put it aside , she put it aside very thoroughly , folding it and laying it with its envelope on the grass . Then she said , " You 're joking . " " No , I 'm not joking . They 're coming in a trailer . " " What ? " " In a trailer . In Kermit 's trailer . " " When ? " said Nancy . Her voice was level . " When are they com-ing ? " Arthur consulted the card . " He does n't say . All he says is , ' Makingleisurely trip with Giff Maxim . We plan to drop in on you in about a week for a day or two . We wo n't be a nuisance ; we are selfsustaining . All we need is a piece of level ground for the trailer . Much to talk to you about . Greetings to you both and to John . ' " And Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said very simply , " Arthur , you must stop them . " " I 'm afraid it 's too late . They 've left already . " He consulted the other side of the card . " I ca n't make out the postmark , but it 's not from Westport . Kermit must have mailed it on the way . " " They ca n't come , " Nancy said . " I wo n't let them stay . You wo n't let them stay , will you ? " " I do n't quite know how to tell them to go away , Nan , " Arthur said reasonably . " How ' ? " Nancy repeated after him indignantly . " You just tell them . Just tell them they ca n't stay . I do n't want to hurt Kermit 's feelings but if he puts himself in that position it will just have to be said to him . And what does he mean  --  ' much to talk about ' ? Talk about Maxim and his lies ? That 's what he must mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken in and corrupted . " Susan had been looking from one to the other with wide eyes , and at the word " corrupted " she blinked intelligently . She , of course , knew about corrupted . There had been the conversation with Laskell about artists . From the road her mother called her . " Come along , Susan , " Emily Caldwell said . But Susan did not hear . " Susan , your mother 's calling you , " said Nancy . With an effort the child tore herself away . But she walked so slowly in her desire to learn about the life of moral danger that her mother had to call her again . And so Susan hastened her steps and did not learn how intense the life of moral danger could be . She did not hear the passion with which Nancy said , " I simply wo n't have him near me . Arthur said , " None of us wants him , Nancy . " But Laskell knew how inadequate that would be for Nancy . She had more reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said , " Look , Nancy  --  I do n't blame you for not wantinghim around . But do n't exaggerate things . Ile has n't turned into a devil , he does n't have horns . You yourself found things to admire in that crazy essay of his . And I want to tell you  --  maybe I should have mentioned it before  --  that I was struck by a kind of honorableness he still had , even though he did desert the Party . For example , he would n't tell me what his secret and special work was . I asked him if he wanted to tell me and he made a point of saying no . It was the best he could do to give Nancy the reassurance he knew she needed that Maxim would not come in shouting references to letters addressed in a certain way . Perhaps she took some comfort from what he said , for her voice when she spoke was much gentler . She said , " I 'm not exaggerating , John . You and I do n't feel alike on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural . You live for yourself , you do n't know how real certain things can be to other people . It 's simply that your mind is turned in a different direction . I never realized it , I suppose . But the way you love the past , for instance  --  " her voice was now infinitelykind , so kind that it destroyed him . " I do think you , care more about the past than you do about the future , John . And that 's your right , it 's understandable , I do understand it . " She frowned with her concentration of friendly understanding . " But it makes you tolerant of things I ca n't be tolerant of . I do n't think about them , I just feel them . I just feel them here . " And she laid her hand upon herself and upon the developing child that was her guarantee . So full a statement seemed to have discharged her feelings wholly , for she broke off and said , " I 'm sorry I made a fuss . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear . And I wo n't make a scene when they come . If we possibly can , we 'll get Kermit to take him away . Or maybe we can say that we 're just going off on a little visit ourselves . We 'll work it out somehow . " She had closed the subject . There was nothing more to be said . Not that Laskell could have said anything . He did not dare speak for the destruction that was going on within him . It was a soft destruction , almost voluptuous . Duck came out and said , " Mr. Groom , come in and look at this for a minute . " Arthur went and Laskell was left alone with Nancy . She was sitting in a chair and he was sitting on the grass facing her , in a quite ordinary summer attitude , his knees drawn up and his hands clasped around them . It was an absurdly incongruous position for what was going on inside him . As Laskell looked back on that moment , he was appalled to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not merely that his friendship with Nancy would have ended , and thus his friendship with Arthur . More than that : his friendship to himself , such as it was , would have ended too ; he himself would have ended . Nancy 's gentle definition of him was at work , making a deep voluptuous emptiness in him . It frightened him , but it also drew him . Something within him was cooperating with Nancy 's definition to dismiss him from the world of men . If self-preservationis a virtue , he deserved from himself more credit than he knew in doing what he now did . He said , " You did receive those letters for Maxim , did n't you ? Arthur refused , but you said yes . Is n't that so ? " His voice was strange and dead . His only conscious impulse when he spoke was to assert a dominance which should out-top Nancy 's cool , kind , killing knowledge of him , to meet knowledge with knowledge . At the moment when , as it were , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crudest impulse he had . But suddenly her two hands went to her cheeks , which were white , and she looked at him with scared eyes . He was reminded of what he had forgotten , that she was a woman and one for whom he had love and that she was in guilt and trouble . " He told you ! He told you ! " Nancy cried . And then she said bitterly , " Of course , how like him . "  | " No , " he said . " He did not tell me . He was very careful to tell me nothing . " " Then who told you ? How do you know ? " He could recognize that she was a woman for whom he had love , but he felt no affection for her . He said , " I saw it the evening I told you about him . " " You saw it ? What do you mean , you saw it ? " He said irritably , " Saw it  --  something in your manner . It just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew . I just knew . " She made a puzzled impatient gesture such as a child makes to whom something is incomprehensible , letting her lack of comprehensionstand as a comment on the foolishness of the thing . " Intuition , " she said with a slighting dryness . " Call it intuition . It does n't matter how I knew , does it ? " The impatience in her face again changed to fear . But Laskell continued , " Why did you do it ? And what did you think you weredoing ? " " Why did I do it ? Because nobody else did it . I suppose I did it because you can ask that question . " Fear did not make her timid . It never would . " Or because Arthur said no ? " He did not quite know why he had asked that question . " Do n't be ridiculous , " Nancy said . " What do you think I am ? " But then her face cleared and she said in a frank , puzzled way , " Maybe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think you were doing ? What made the great secrecy , all the mysterious flummery ? " She did not answer . Laskell said , " Then you do know ? Maxim refused to let me ask any questions . He refused to let Arthur ask any questions . Did he let you ask questions ? How do you know ? " " I did n't say I knew . " " But you know . " " Is this the intuition again ? " " Did Maxim tell you ? " " Oh , " she said , " I do n't really know . I only know in a general way . I know more or less why they were important . " " But you wo n't say ? "  | " No , I wo n't say . " There was so much of a note of tragic , conscious heroism in the way she said it , that there jumped to Laskell 's mind the possibility that it was to be accounted for by a love affair with Gifford Maxim . But then another clandestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high intensity of her dedication  --  andit was this second possibility that he chose , rejecting the first . " Nancy , " he said , " are you a Party member ? " " It 's not exactly a crime , you know . There 's no law against it that you should ask in that tone of voice . " " Then you arc ? " " No ! " she cried desperately . " No , I 'm not . But is it such a horror to contemplate ? No , I 'm not exactly a Party member . " " Not exactly ! What does that mean ? Do you have a card or do n't you ? " " No . Of course I do n't ! " After all she had said , it was not clear on what ground she was repelling the imputation as if it were a slur upon her . " Of course I have n't got a card . But I 'm considering it , I 'm so tired of all this liberal shilly-shallying talk . I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kermit Simpsons with their civil liberties and their Jeffersonian democracies . " " And the John Laskells ? " He said it gently and in joke , but his voice was weary . He had an image of the world 's misery , of what was to be faced , and he did not know who was strong enough to resist it . But Nancy 's voice was wearier than his . " Oh , John  --  no , " she said . " It 's just that in all this world , with things so terrible and moving so fast , it 's just that some action , something positive  --  " And she made a sad little gesture of helplessness . " I do n't know . It 's so frightening . I want to do what I can . " " Yes , " he said . " Maybe I 'm wrong . Maybe I did something foolish . You think I 'm wrong ? " " Somehow , yes . " She said nothing for a moment . Then she said , " He really did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without his telling you ? " " No , he did n't tell me. "  | " I 'm glad you know , " she said . " Somehow , I 'm glad you know . " She looked at him ruefully , but he could see that she was really glad . Her face looked tired , but it had a freshness of genuine relief in it . " Probably Arthur should know too , " she said . And then she looked at him with great appeal and said , " What 's the matter ? " " Matter ? Nothing 's the matter . " " You looked so  --  Are we not friends ? " She had seen the look on his face from his fresh full knowledge of what he had to escape in Nancy , of what this charming and moral woman friend of his could do to him , and was willing to do , until he asserted his own will consciously against her intention of which she had no awareness . Laskell , looking at the hand she stretched out to him tentatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could say , as he took the hand and held it between his , " Yes . We are very good friends . " He could say it firmly and surely . But he could not tell her how sad he was for his friend , and not only for his friend but for the world . And yet it was a calm sadness , and they were truly friends , and to show her that this was so , when Duck came out with Arthur , Laskellsaid to Duck , " I wonder if you could show me the stream some morning . The fish do n't rise much this time of summer , but I 'd like to try anyway . "  | IT WAS four days later that Duck Caldwell and John Laskell went to the stream together . They walked on a little way beyond the Korzinskis ' house and then turned off and cut across a stubble field . It was a misty morning and the mist made ten o'clock seem early and even adventurous . Laskell had two sandwiches in the khaki tackle-bag on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasion yet more adventurous , and so , in a way , did his feeling about Duck . Ile could not say that he liked Duck any better than he ever had but he felt reconciled to him , and he thought how weak the human imagination is because it so dully represents peace and brotherhood . A careful , shabby Hindu student and a skinny Methodist student shake hands and agree that there are no real differences between people that can not be overcome by mutual understanding and education and the eider and doughnuts they will presently be offered by the religious director . The world 's imagination of strife was surely much more attractive . It allowed men their force and their selfhood as well as their evil . Yet in actual fact , Laskell thought , the true emotion of reconciliation is an heroic one . Hamlet never appears in fuller virility than when he offers Laertes his hand , and nothing he says rings with a sweeter and graver note of masculinity than his " Give me your pardon , sir . I have done you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was walking a little ahead of Laskell . The lurch and swagger of his walk were to be seen and disliked . But Laskell knew that he did not have to like Duck in any usual way to feel the warm pleasure of reconciliation . A true image of peace , like the world 's false image of strife , also allowed a man his force and selfhood , and if force and selfhood involved a little malice , the true image of peace allowed that too . Duck had his little malice , but it was not always easy to maintain the self in its force without the help of a little malice . This was the heroism of true peace , that it was not frightened by what force and self might involve . Yet how precarious peace was . How difficult it was for men to keep in comradeship . Duck turned around to say , " This walk beingtoo hard for you , Mr. Laskell ? You got to remember you been sick . " Laskell said , " I 'm fine , " very sharp in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure in reminding him of his illness . " Sure . Sure you are , " Duck said soothingly . " But you got to be careful after you been sick . " " I 've been careful long enough , " Laskell said dryly . " Sure . Maybe so , " Duck said . Laskell felt ashamed . It was not Duck who had broken the peace but he himself with his quick defensive response to the malicehe had heard in Duck 's tone . But then Laskell put aside the impulse to blame himself . If malice is to be permitted , he thought , it must be met , and he had met it with his sharp answer . They could be at peace again . Perhaps peace between men is a series of reconciled conflicts between equals . And suddenly Laskell felt how truly Duck was his equal . As they walked together , Laskell saw the pattern of the other man 's life and understood that it was by that pattern that Duck was to be judged , that it was the pattern that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duck said out of some false notion of how to represent his self and his force to the world . Judged by that pattern , Duck was perhaps not only Laskell 's equal but even his superior . He had refused the usual claims of society , the whole absurd contest that modern life invited him to . It was no mere laziness that kept him in the little house that he had made of two sheds , doing odd jobs when he chose or needed to ; it was rather a response to something he saw in life that he did not want for himself . Perhaps it was something he had seen at first hand in the career of his grandfather , the Senator , with his fine horse and buggy and his living on the rural fat of the land , or something he had seen in the career of his father , whop189speculated . At any rate , by his own Pattern , he had done well , he had done better by a good bit than John Laskell . And he had more . If one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan to take into account . Duck 's quick and subtle intelligence showed itself not only in his malicious perceptionsof human weakness , but also in his child . In any estimate of Duck , it had to be taken into account that he was Susan 's father . And , really , it had also to be taken into account that he was Emily'shusband . It was perhaps no small thing to be , Laskell suddenly saw , as he thought of Emily , not as she was in her mind with its rather foolish , dated ideas , but as she was in her body . Laskell had sometimes thought that people in their imposed functions were rather better than the same people when they stepped outside their functions . The girls in the office who were notable for the simplicity and directness in their characters , for the pleasure they took and gave in being efficient , might , at the Christmasparty , when they were talked to only in a social way and about things in general , become rather petulant and self-pitying people with no firmness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance organized him so well when he was being professional , became , when you had cocktails with him , in the effort to get to " know " him , as soggy as a soul could be . And now that Laskellhad lately begun to see Emily Caldwell as a mother and even as a wife he had to modify the not very high opinion of her that he had originally made . As Susan and he had become more and more friendly it seemed more and more natural that he should stop to talk with Susan 's mother . They did not talk about very much , such things as gardening and Susan and Susan 's education and the Bazaar . Once his first mythological view of Emily Caldwell had been dispelled , Laskell had not found her very interesting either as an intellectual or as a rebel . She really did not have the gift for being either . But in her function as Susan 's mother with her worry about Susan 's education , in her function as housekeeper with her little prides in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary things , Laskell had found her more and more impressive . She had a womanly dignity that did not depend on intellect  --  a kind of biological intelligence . Laskell did not like to admit it , but he had to admit it  --  Duck Caldwell had chosen a woman who was ,  |p190if  you got to know her , at least of full size . Mrs. Folger had seen in Duck what there was for a woman to see , and probaby Emily had responded to that when she had chosen Duck . It was much the same thing Nancy had seen when she had made her remark about Duck 's resemblance to the gamekeeper in Lady Chatterley . Laskell had heard their female judgment with irony  --  naturally enough , any man would . But now did n't he have to admit that their female judgment was right ? From the field they had struck into woods . It was very hot and damp in the woods and Laskell found that he was breathing hard in the steamy air . He had put on his waders on Duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They made his legs and thighs feel sweaty and pneumatic . Laskell had snapped at Duck for suggestingthat the illness had had a continuing effect on him , but the fact was that he was not in very good shape . He heard the sound of water with relief . " Is that the stream ? " he asked . " Yes . But you would n't want to fish it here . " " Why not ? " Duck shook his head . " You 'll see , " he said . What Laskell saw , when they came to it , was a deep gorge . The walls were very steep and the little river came fast into the dark pool . It came in noisily over a bed of large stones , breaking on the boulders at the mouth of the gorge . The black surface of the pool was laced with long streamers of white foam . The air here was cool , almost chill . The pool looked very promising . " This looks very good , " Laskell said . " Not bad , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies upstream , you better start further up . " He looked at Laskell and then at the water . " You 'd have a hard time working up from here . " Laskell saw that Duck was right . The stretch of rocky footing would be rather too much for him today . He had fished water as difficult as this , but when he had been in better shape . On his first day out it would be better to start farther up . And on the whole he was glad that it was not here that he would part with Duck . There was something frightening about the gorge . They stood looking into the chasm together . Duck said , " I call this Cherry Gorge . "  | " Is that its name ? " said Laskell . " No . It has n't got a name . But my name for it is Cherry Gorge . This is where all the girls around here lose it . The boys take them for a ride and the road comes in close by the other side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorge , Mamie ? ' And she says , Why that would be just lovely . " In the voice of Mickey and Minnie Mouse , Duck acted out the false casualness of the boy and the false innocence of the girl . " Why that would be just too sweet , ' she says , and down they go and lucky if they do n't break their necks over some couple that 's got there first . Maybe the noise makes the girls scared and shivery and they 're willing for you to get close . Anyway , they do n't come up like they went down . " It was the old freebooting sexual camaraderie of men , and the embarrassment it precipitated in Laskell made him angry at himself for being so cut off from simplicity and directness . Duck looked down , spat out into the gorge , and prepared to leave . " I 'd like to get me that Eunie Folger down here some night and see how she 's made . I wish I had your chances , sleeping right near her every night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stiff inability to respond in the same tone as Duck 's . But he could find nothing to say . And Duck knew it . " I guess , " said Duck , and looked at Laskell with his clever eyes , " I guess you think I 've got a dirty mind , kind of low . But the way I figure is that we got just about enough hypocrisy . I work it out like this , a man 's made a certain way , a woman 's made a certain way , the natural result is they got a need for each other . A woman'sgot just as much need for a man as a man 's got for a woman . I do n't care what they tell us different , it 's so . That Eunie Folger , for instance , I bet she 's not so cold if you could just once put your hand where it would do the most good . The women make believe it 's not so , but it is . They carry their heads high and they carry their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " " Oh , sure , " said Laskell . " Sure ! " Duck nodded firmly . " Let me tell you  --  we got cathousesfor men , if we had cat-houses for women , they 'd do just as good business . Just as good . And then comes in religion and a bunch of hypocrites and it 's no business of theirs but they make it their business and they interfere . It 's none of their god-damned business . It 's just nature . Am I right ? And if , it 's just nature and just a personal matter , who are they to interfere ? Let me tell you a thing . If you got yourself up one night and had an inspiration and went into Eunie 's room and give her a couple of pokes , you 'd be doing her a favor . I do n't care how tight she goes around looking . You 're a man got a good education . You tell me  --  am I wrong ? " " No of course you 're not wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know about Eunice  --  " " So there you are , just like I said . And mark my words , the day will come when people going to get some sense . That 's my way of thinking about it . " Duck turned full to Laskell and said , " And I want to tell you another thing , Mr. Laskell . " He paused to arouse curiosity about the other thing he was going to tell . He stood with his mouth poised to speak . Then he said , " You may think I got a low mind . But I ai n't talking like a young kid that wants his first piece and ca n't wait till he gets it . I mean to say : there 's just so many apples on a tree . A man 's got just so much in him and no more . And believe me , I did n't spare none of mine . Maybe you know how that is . Guess maybe I 'm older than you but maybe you live the same way , not sparing yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What you got you got , and what you lose you do n't get back . " And Duck opened his mouth and pointed to the gap in his upper teeth . " Even if I got me some store teeth , they might look good , but they would n't be my teeth . What 's gone is gone . Well . Anyway . What I was saying , what you lose , you lose , so I 'm talking from my head . " Duck covered his brow with the palm of his hand . " It comes from here , " he said , " and not from you-know-where . " And Duck clutched you-know-where . " So it ai n't a crazy hot idea , " he concluded . Then he added , " Yet still , " and he grinned , " yet still I 'd like to have me a poke at that Eunie Folger . " They left the gorge and cut a wide circle and came to the stream again . It was strong and rapid even now in August , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can follow up from here easy enough , " Duck said . " And when you want to find your way back , you 'll see where it cuts in close to the road and that 's only a mile on the road from the Folgers ' house . "  |p193And  he stood there while Laskell jointed his rod , fixed on the reel , threaded the line through the guides , and tied on the leader . The fly that Laskell chose was a Coachman . It was not a rational choice , but he could not , under Duck 's eye , stop to study the stream as Kermit Simpson had taught him to do . When he was ready , Duck said , " Well , good luck . " Then he said , " You one of those fishermen takes a flask with him ? " " I 'm sorry , I did n't bring one . " " I just thought , " Duck said . He went away . But he left his void behind him , left it with Laskelland in him . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laskellmight think it . It was simply void . It was nothing , the pure will of nothingness . Or it was the nothingness of pure will . It was not wickedness . It was emptiness masking itself as mind and desire . Laskell thought of the wan white Eunice Folger of Duck 's speculations , and of Emily , Duck 's wife , whose relation with this man he , Laskell , had but a few minutes before made to count for so much to his credit . And he thought of Mrs. Folger and Nancy , and of their poor misplaced confidence in Duck 's " manliness , " and of his own misplaced confidence in their female judgment . It was perhaps funny that he had no sooner decided to accept their estimateof Duck 's masculinity than Duck himself had been to such pains to set him straight . But Laskell felt no impulse to laugh . Lack of practice made him awkward with his casting . He dutifullyreminded himself of all the things he must think about  --  arm close to the body , wrist loose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not believe that it made any difference . He did not really believe that there were fish in the stream , or that he could catch them , or that fish had ever been caught by this method . You equipped yourself expensively , you learned the technique , you did everything the way you had been taught , and even , for the deceptive pleasure of it , you debated the theory of flies with other fishermen , arguing about just what it was that the fish saw when the fly floated over its head . But nothing really happened , or whatever happened happened for quite other reasons and not because you did what you did . He moved slowly upstream , unsure of his footing . His thighs were tired and he moved more carefully than the current required.  | He did not like the way he moved . He was not being wary but nervous . But the stream began to do some of its work on Laskell . The morning mist cleared away and the air freshened . The sun came through the overhang of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole and then vanish into it . A kingfisher worked the stream ahead of him for a few minutes . It was as blue and direct as lightning . His blood began to pick up a little with the exercise . Some sense of possibility returned to him . He began to like being alone . He forgot about Duck , forgot about Mrs. Folger 's estimate of Duck , and Nancy 's , and his own , and how they had just been contradictedby Duck 's own statement . He forgot about everything excepthimself , and then he forgot about himself . He began to note the likely places to drop his fly and to feel that they might yield something . After an hour he could do as well with the rod as he had ever done . By noon the sun was out full and the sky was clear . He settled on a broad shelving rock to eat his sandwiches . He ate slowly , then he lit a cigarette . He was enjoying himself enormously . But perhaps he sat too long . Suddenly he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was alone in . His awareness of the life of the stream and of the banks became intense . He did not think of the trout he was presumably fishing for but of the blind and primeval things , the things of slime and darkness , the slugs and hellgrammites and leeches that must inhabit the stream . He thought of the eels that lived here , whose flesh made as fine eating , in its own way , as the trout . He remembered that it was said that the eels of every stream , all over the world , eventually made their way to the Sargasso Sea to die , moving from tributary stream to stream , in their necessity sometimes crossing the land to come at last to the sea , where , in the interlaced company of millions of their kind , they gave up the eel ghost . He got up to enter the stream again and he saw , just behind where he had been sitting , the corpse of a huge white moth , of a staring and powdery white , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sails . Its big chrysalis lay near it , so perhaps it had never flown even once since it had emerged , but had been attacked whilep195it waited for the first impulse and knowledge of flight to come to its wings . It lay there wrecked and dead , and insects worked their careful way in trains into the hull of its body . Seeing it , so white and wholly dead , Laskell shuddered . The woods thinned out as he made his way up the stream . The banks were broader here , and there was a heavy bordering brush of laurel . The sun was now very strong on the surface of the water and it hurt his eyes . They were standing there in the full light of the sun and seemed to emerge from the glare of the water , and their heads were piled with white soapsuds , so that , what with one circumstance and another , they at first seemed an illusion of brightness . They stood with arms upraised , shampooing vigorously . The water came to Susan 's waist and Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily reached out and rubbed the suds into Susan 's hair . She stooped so that Susan could do the same for her . Then Susan pushed her mother backwards into the water and when Emily emerged her long hair was washed of the suds and hung dark and heavy on both sides of her face . She shoved it behind her ears and then , in retaliation , she pushed Susan down , but with a kind of slow care , holding the child 's hand . She examined Susan 's hair to see that all the soap was gone from it . It seemed not to be , for at a word from her mother , Susan ducked down again , disappearing under the water with a single movement , as though she were curtsying . Emily too ducked under the surface again , and for a moment her hair floated out on the surface . She stood up with her head bent to one side and wrung out the hair as if it were a cloth or a hank of yarn . Susan 's gestures were as large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller crop . Then they trudged out of the stream and were lost to Laskell'ssight . And yet by a strange ocular confusion , he was not wholly certain that they had left the stream  --  they had seemed so dissolved in sunlight that he had thought they might still be there but not clearly seen . Then he heard their chatter and laughter on the bank . Laskell stayed where he was . His body felt extraordinarily alert , poised for movement , but he was willing not to move . They had not seen him and for all Emily Caldwell 's reputed principles about nakedness , he did not want them to know that he had seen them . He did not move  --  the sight seemed to be still there even after Emily and Susan had actually left the stream . The pair dawdled a good while on the bank , and Laskell waited carefully . The memory of the sight suffused him with light or reason , or both . His line drifted downstream behind him . When he no longer heard their voices on the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his line and took off the Coachman , which had not brought him a single strike . He put on a Quill Gordon , which , he thought , might be better for the glare of the stream . Fastening the knot , he thought of Emily and Susan walking home in the sun with towels over their shoulders and their hair spread out on the towels to catch the sun . There was no point in casting over their bathing place . What fish were there would now have been hopelessly disturbed , but he did cast over it anyway . Her voice was so unexpected  --  " Any luck ? " was of course what she said  --  that he turned in the very act of the cast , and it may have been that a stone beneath his foot moved with his shift of weight , or it may have been that the cause of the accident was beneath another surface than that of the stream , but his ankle twisted and he felt his balance going with that slow , consciousdeliberateness with which balance always goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved , and then he was down and under . His awareness , once the self-protective jump of his heart had passed , was of humor and relief and of the light on the bottom . Emily Caldwell was standing there beside him when he got up , making gestures toward helping him . She could scarcely have thought there was any danger  --  still , when someone falls into the water one naturally goes to his help , and she was there to rescue him if there were need . But there was actually nothing to rescue except Laskell 's hat . It had begun to float placidly downstream . She snatched for it with a kind of indignation at its waywardness . " It 's my fault , all my fault , " she said . " I startled you . I 'm sorry . " But Laskell was laughing . The waders were filled and were holding the water . He was encased in water and he stood holding the rod out from him as if he feared getting it wet . " It 's my fault , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed him the hat and he put it on his head so that its wet and drooping brim would complete his comic ruin . She looked at him and burst out laughing . With his heavy weight of water , Laskell walked to the bank . " What are you going to do ? " Emily said . Her own skirt had got wet halfway up ; and she wore no shoes . " I 'm going to sit here and dry out , " Laskell said . He unlaced his wading boots and drew them off with difficulty . His ankle was sore from the twist , but it was not sprained . He took off the big woolen socks . He unfastened the shoulder straps of the waders but he could not get the heel of the waders down over his own heel . She saw this and said , " Would you like me to pull ? " " Please , " he said . It was never easy to get them off and now it was harder because they were wet inside . But she was strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the cuffs of his trousers . The shirt that he took off she laid neatly on a rock to dry . There was nothing else to do , so she sat down beside him . She fluffed out her hair in the sun . He smiled at her . " Where 's Susan ? " he said . " Oh , Susan 's gone to pick berries . " And she blushed , for anyone could hear in her tone the certainty that Susan would not be coming back . She said , " How do you know that Susan was here ? Could you hear us ? " " Yes , I could hear you . And I saw you  --  saw you washing your hair . " " Did you ? " she said quite comfortably . She was clearly a woman of some vanity . He thought she had good reason to be . He looked at her frankly and curiously . She could not but be aware of what their situation might hold , what with her assurance to him that her daughter would not be coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sadness , not at all pained or fearful , only submissive . It was not in the least to him that she was submitting and that was what , to Laskell , made that look of hers so wonderful . It illuminated for him the presence that had been in his voice , unbidden , when he had said , " I saw you washing your hair . " She was submitting to the quite impersonal presence that had made his voice ring so simply and wonderingly as he said that . His heart began to quicken with excitement . But he made no move , and she , not abashed by whatever he might have seen in her face , not put out because he did not immediatelyact upon what he saw , said to him , " They tell me you have been very ill . Are you all right now ? " " Oh , yes ! " he said , as if there had never been any question of that . " Never felt better . " " But you were very ill ? Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought about it . " Yes , I suppose it was in a way . " In a way ? " " I mean the doctor told me afterward that there had been some danger . But I never knew about it until after . " " Danger is danger , " she said firmly . " Who took care of you ? " " I had two nurses , " Laskell announced . He grinned reminiscently . " Two ? " She was much impressed . " Yes , two . Day and night . As different as day and night . Miss Debry and Miss Paine . " It was funny that he should tell her about Miss Debry first , about her starch and her cap and her talkativeness and her beauty . Emily Caldwell listened quietly with her large , mild look turned to him . She did not interrupt or ask questions until he reached the point where he had told Dr. Graf that he would prefer to keep Miss Paine , letting Miss Debry go . " Oh ! " said Emily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been sicker than I thought . Yes , I must have been very sick  --  in my mind too . I could lie there for hours on end just looking at a flower . It was a particular flower , a rose . " And , strangely enough , here he was telling Emily Caldwell what he had not been able to tell Nancy or Arthur or anyone else , about the complex emotions he had had about the flower . It was difficult to tell . But not because he was embarrassed or because she was unreceptive , but because he was no longer very much inter/ested in it and found it hard to remember the details . And yet he wanted to tell it , so that it would be no longer part of him , so that it would be an object in the world , existing outside himself . " Paine said to me , You seem to be having quite a love affair with that flower . ' And she was right . " " Ah well , " Emily said , " so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too easy an escape and he refused to accept it . He presentedher with the worst of his conclusions about that affair . " I think it was death I was in love with . " She looked at him very hard . " What makes you say that ? " she asked brusquely . He shrugged . " It 's an idea I had , " he said . And then he gave her the reasons he had worked out . He told her about the " satisfaction " that Dr. Graf had heard in his voice when he had asked the questionabout nearly dying . He told her of Paine 's arch remark , " I think he does n't want to get well . " And as best he could he told her of his perception that his sense of perfect rest , of an existence without any of the conditions of existence , his feeling of identification with the perfection of the flower , was but a disguised desire for non-existence . And as he told it , almost querulously insisting on his point , he became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , the spot of fatigue around which all his energies , when he had them , were organized . Yes , he insisted , he had been in love with death . " And if ? " said Emily . " What ? " he said . " And supposing ? " she said . " And supposing you were ? " He was puzzled and annoyed . " What do you mean ? " he said . " I 'm not sure you were . When Susan was a baby I used to do the same thing  --  I mean just look and look and look . It became like a trance . I felt she was so complete and I was so complete . It was n't that I was admiring her . It was  --  Well , I do n't know what it was . But it was n't what you say it was . " He was not ready to admit the similarity of the two experiences . Nor did she press it , but returned to his . " And supposing you were ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In love with death a little . It was only a little . Supposing you were . You have a right . Are you supposed to hate it ? " He did not then know from what authority she spoke , but he heard authority in her voice , enough to make him stare at her and not answer . " Are you ? " she insisted , a little passionately . " No , " he had to admit . " Well then ! " she said , bridling with pleasure and tossing her head at having won the argument . He could not have reconstructed the dialectic by which she had reached her victory and he did not try . He was quite satisfied that she had won . He felt the legs of his trousers . They were still very wet . He stood up to shake them from his legs to which they were clinging . He went to the rock on which she had laid his shirt and felt the shirt . It was dryer than his trousers but still pretty damp . She , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this interest in damp clothes , squeezed out the hem of her skirt and spread it out over her knees . She lifted her arms and fluffed out her long hair and tossed it about in the sun . He came and stood beside her and looked down at her . She did not stop tossing her heavy hair until he knelt down beside her , and even then she did not take her hands from it  --  she met his look with motionless gravity , her arms still raised . She did not take her hands from her hair until he first touched her . It was only later , when they were lying precisely side by side , their clasped hands hidden from sight between them , that Laskell felt that he understood not so much the logic as the basis in fact of her argument . IHis mind , submerged deeper and deeper beneath the dark and unoppressive somnolence of his body , held a last awareness of its willing extinction , the price of the passion it had been unable to stop and scarcely able to observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it concurred in its evanescence , and as it faded into the doze , it drew the expense of spirit that had just been made into a conjunction with all the expenditures of spirit of any kind , this sexual kind , or the exhaustion and stillness at the end of a work , or of a life fully and finally expended ; and it even , before Laskell closed his eyes on it , flaunted the recollection that men hadp201used the word " die " for the last destroying agony of love , which they sought . It all seemed very clear to Laskell at the point of his falling asleep , but when he awoke it made no sense at all , but was only one of those revelations that come from the influence of sleep or drugs in which the sensation of understanding is so great that one has the certainty that one has understood something . It seemed that he opened his eyes almost immediately after closing them . And he opened them on a world of difficulty . He saw that he was in a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The words that carried the meaning of his fear were so vulgar that he shook his head to drive them away . His body was grateful , but his mind , as if in revenge for its defeat and submergence , raised the ugly and vulgar question . He felt more truly himself than he could remember having felt for a long time . The carping remnants of his illness seemed finally to have gone , and not until they were gone did he know how much they had been there . For this , he saw , he must be grateful to Emily Caldwell . Yet how much more grateful to Emily Caldwell he would now be if she would vanish , at this very moment , having made this strange beneficentvisitation of hers . That would be the right and proper way for the event to shape itself , the economical way . What she had done , what she had made known of herself , these were of this very instant , of this time and place . It could never happen again by so complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened by trying to reproduce it . In order to see her again he would undertake to circumvent all the circumstances that surrounded her . There were her husband and her child and her poverty , and Nancy 's hostile eye , and Mrs. Folger 's . Above all , he thought , there was the barrier of her own mind . He did not know by what great chance she had today said just the right things which had had so strange and relieving an effect upon him , not when he remembered the many affected and pretentious things she had said in the past . He wished that the astonishing truth of her few chance words and the astonishing truth of her body would never have to give way to the foolish articulations of her intellect . He feared the moment when she would speak . She would say something about " freedom " or " paganism . " He wished that now ,  | at this moment , she would vanish in the golden cloud in which she had come . But she gave no sign of vanishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary flesh that does not easily vanish , her hand still in his , her ankles lightly crossed and her skirt neatly over her legs where he had disposed it for her . No sign at all of vanishing , but only of being about to speak . She turned her head and smiled at him . She seemed to begin with difficulty , and apparently to make it easier for herself she sat up . In what she said there was nothing silly or affected or in the fashion of what another decade had been in the habit of saying after its love-making . When their conversation was over , the cloud had appeared in which she was to vanish . She quite brought to an end all question of there being a " situation " for Laskell , of his being in any way " involved . " The cloud she conjured up for herself was , however , not exactly a golden one . Her beginning was not promising . She said , " It should n't have happened . Should it have ? " To this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was docile and modified her opinion at once . " Then it must not happen again . " To this he must refuse to agree . " Why not ? " he said huffily . She really had no tenacity about her views . She sat with her legs drawn up , her skirt wrapped neatly around them , and she looked over her knees at the stream . " Then it must n't happen this way . I do n't mean  --  What I mean is  --  " She was very miserable . " If we ever do meet again  --  I mean like this  --  would you  --  That is , if you ever do want again  --  " She had not been well trained in the franknesson which her culture prided itself . " I must n't take any chances . Do you mind ? But if I were to become pregnant  --  " It was the practical discussion that all lovers have to have . She had now turned a little toward him and her weight was on one hand while with the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distract his attention from what she was saying . She was blushingand looking down at her finger 's work . " You see , " she said , and looked up at him in full apology . " It 's because of Susan . " " Susan ? "  | " I mean if I were to become pregnant . " It was not her husband that she spoke of in connection with this contingency . As Laskell looked at her face , he saw no slightest sign of guilt in it . And he felt none himself . Still , he thought , guilt or no guilt , it would be no light thing that he would be implicated in . No light thing at all , considering it apart from morality , consideringit only practically , poverty being what it was . But that was the colder of the two ideas that were in his mind . The warmer one was the contingency itself , the idea of a pregnant Emily . You see , " she said , " Susan is so ill . " " Ill ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious . " She does n't look ill . " " She does n't , does she ? And she does n't know  --  does n't really know . But ever since she was little . It 's her  --  it 's the heart . " She seemed to prefer to say " the heart " rather than " her heart , " as if it made the weakness less immediate . He did not believe it . But he remembered the evidences that showed that the child 's mother was determined to act as if she believed it . There was the time when she had called after him when he was walking away with Susan , cautioning him against walking too fast up the hill  --  it was not him she was concerned for but Susan . He remembered how cool she had been to Susan 's declarationof her ambition to become a dancer . He understood why it was that Susan could violently tumble Emily into the water with only the gentlest retaliation from her mother . There would have to be retaliation , Susan would have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in token form . And yet Laskell did not really believe what Emily Caldwell was telling him . " I try to make a life just as if nothing were the matter with her . And I want her to have every pleasure now . " He remembered her carpe diem , the swift passage of envious time . Yet still somehow Laskell did not believe her . As she spoke of the threat to her daughter , she had the air of one of those young women  --  Laskell had known several  --  who make up elaborate and romantic lies about their lives , transparent lies , which give them significance or excuse their actions , either their sexual fear or their sexual excess . They invent tragic events in the past and speak with certain knowledge of tragic events to come , early betrayals by men or fate , or family " tendencies , " illnesses of mind or body that are yet to appear , either in themselves or in some member of the family to whom they will have to devote themselves , or insisting that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recur in their own lives . It is for this reason , they say , that they will never marry , for they can only bring sorrow to the men they marry , or it is for this reason that they are so prodigal in their sexuality . In such lies and fantasies of fate , there is always the dignity of necessity , no matter how easily the lies can be seen through  --  they are needed and therefore one listens to them with a kind of awe . For the moment , he was convinced she was lying . But whether she was lying or not , the extremity of her statement  --  of her truth , if it was the truth ; of her lie , if it was a lie  --  quite drove from Laskell'smind any thoughts about being caught in a " situation . " It was not only because she was saying , whether it was a lie or not , that she had her own large and particular fate in which he had no part . It was also because her speaking of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a critical mind might hold against her  --  her having been a schoolteacher or librarian with ideals , her being the wife of Duck Caldwell , her having run a tearoom , if it was true she had done that , her sad artisticslang , her foolish reading of Spengler , her foolish painted bowls . All these things that had stood as a barrier between them , now , as she spoke of mortality , whether in truth or in falsehood , became quite beside the point . He said quietly , " Are you sure about that ? Was it only the local doctor who told you ? " For he had the city man 's lack of faith in country doctors . " Yes , it 's sure . " And she looked at him with something like an apology , as if she were very sorry to have to force the inescapable truth upon him , as if she were sorry that she could not let him prove his doubts . " Yes , I 've had her to two Hartford doctors , very good men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oh , I should n't have told you . I should n't have . She does n't know  --  nobody knows . You wo n't speak of it to anyone , will you ? Not even to Mr. and Mrs. Croom . Especially not to Mrs. Folger . Even her father does n't know . "  |p205He  did not even bother to give his promise of secrecy . " Her father does n't know ! How could you not have told him ? " Emily looked puzzled . " I do n't know , " she said . " He would n't respect her . " " Would n't respect her ? What do you mean ? " It was the only thing she had ever said that could be construed as a criticism of her husband , and when he asked her what she meant by it , she could not explain . After a moment of silence , she said passionately , as much to reassurehim as herself , " But of course it 's just a condition . Nothing has to happen . " And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led her into an account of these circumstances , " So you see ! " " Yes , I see , " Laskell said . He had to believe it now , he did believe it , and yet somehow he saw it as a fantasy , a thing that he could believe only for its own kind of truth . If it was a fact at all , it was not so much a fact in life as a fact in a poem . So here it was , the cloud in which Emily Caldwell would vanish after her visitation . Here was the circumstance that would keep Laskell from being involved in a situation , that would make it possible for him to go his way when the few weeks of summer that were left should have passed . It set her apart and marked her off  --  she was committed elsewhere . It therefore put the term to his commitmentsand his necessities of feeling . And at the same time it gave great dignity to Emily Caldwell and to the eventual separationfrom her . What Laskell did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , it was fortunate that almost immediately it had to take a third person into account . Whatever that relationship was : Laskell did not know what it was , neither now nor later . It was apparently not love , not in any sense in which Laskell would have used the word . There was no promise in it , no exchange of things undertaken , no futurity or desire of futurity . They were to say little to each other and find out little about each other . Laskell was able to see Emily in the light of the simple sexual dignity she had , her quiet gravity , and he saw her in the cloud of mortality in which she walked , whether he thought of this as invention or as fact . But he felt none of the pride or possessiveness he might have expected . He was grateful , but gratitude did not make the bond that connected him with her . Laskell never was able to understand what their connection was , what it might have become or what name it ought to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so really strong , so wholly inexpressible , was its being limited and hedged , its being conditioned and defined , and not only by time and circumstances , and not merely by their own wills or by their own capacities for feeling , but by the existence , the perhaps precarious existence , of a third person , who moved all unconscious of what was between them , and all unconscious of the precariousness of her own existence.  | IT WAS generally admitted among Kermit Simpson 's intellectualfriends that you could not possibly dislike Kermit . It was natural , as things go , that the attempt should have been made . Kermit had a great fortune , from New York real estate on his mother 's side , from Western chemicals on his father 's . He was very handsome , a big , rangy man who was good at field sports , court games , and boating , and it was said that he still took an interest in such things . He had a wife who was expected to be impossible because of her prettiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheila , but who was really a modest and rather intelligent girl with a very solemn sense of duty . Kermit had two children who charmed everyone and a country house so simple in its beauty that even the poorest and most socially maladroit of Kermit 's friends were not ill at ease in it . All this endowment of his life  --  or , indeed , the mere fact that he had once played polo and still owned horses  --  should have closed him out from the sympathy of the people who were his friends , and that it did not was a great tribute to his character and intentions . But Simpson was not really a fortunate man . The ease and luck of his life made demands on him that he could not meet . At this time the way was beginning to open for men like Simpson to have a career in government , just as it was opening for men like Croom . But Kermit had been well-born just a little too late to think of governmentas a career . He needed an American Revolution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Yorktown and to have pledged himself to the Continental Congress . Failing that , he should have been English and in the Foreign Office . His sense of social responsibility had been formed at a time when senses of socialresponsibility were likely to be in conflict with government.  | He declared that his magazine was devoted to Jeffersonian ideas , but that only made an irony  --  as one heard him say " Jeffersonian " in his beautiful Westport house , one might be tempted to think of Monticello and to understand how far apart the two houses were ; and one might think of Mount Vernon too when Kermit stood at his full Washingtonian height and his streak of stubbornness appeared , as it did now and then . But he had never lived in danger , he would never put his ideas or his life or his fortune or his sacred honor to the test of establishing them at Yorktown , he would never face responsibility or defeat or disgrace . Kermit was all too bland . There was no roughness in him . He never followed passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance . The blandness was fatal to his character . Yet as soon as this was seen , one had to see the queer grace he had . He was really an innocent man and he wanted everyone to have what he had . Only now and then did he show the rich man 's sense of vulnerability , the awareness that he could bleed and be bled more copiously than most men . At that time people were quoting an exchange between two American novelists on the subject of the very rich . " The very rich are different from us , " one novelist had said , and the other had replied , " Yes , they have more money . " It was generally felt that the second novelist had disposed of the first , who had shown himself to be a snob , but Kermit Simpson suggested that the very rich are indeed different , that they move at a different tempo , have a different density and intensity , that they have different nerves and , when they are innocent , as Kermit was , a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailer would have been silly , but Arthur and Nancy and Laskell were now crowded into the trailer and gravely followed Kermit 's demonstration with scarcely a teasing word . Kermit showed them how the beds came down ; he showed them the washstand that folded away , the gas stove with its fierce blue flame , the concealed lights and the unexpected lockers . " It 's a special feeling , " Kermit said , " to have a complete home on the move . I must have Scythian blood . You know , the ancient Scythians went around with little wicker houses and they mustp209have felt the way I do . Do you remember D. H. Lawrence 's book of poems about the tortoises ? I know why they interested him so much , the snugness and privacy , you travel with your home on your back . " But the documentation and the justification by means of the ancient Scythians and D. H. Lawrence 's observation of the tortoiseswere not quite enough and Kermit went on . " You know , do n't you , that Sheila and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She 's never been around in the United States and she and I want to see things at first hand , really on the road , no hotels . " The day of seeing the United States from the road was really about over , but Kermit was usually a little late with things , though nonethelesssincere , and nothing could have better justified the sleek aluminum magnificence of the trailer than a tour to inspect the condition of life in America . " What about refrigeration ? " Arthur asked . It was Arthur who was asking the questions . The trailer was sanctuary , and while they were in it , asking questions and getting explanations , they were safe from the confrontation of Nancy and Maxim . In the general exchange of greetings it was not particularlyto be observed that Nancy and Maxim did not approach each other . Maxim had the manner which was not very different from the manner he used to have at meetings of " sympathizers . " He was detached from what was going on , his manner said , these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet at the same time he was enormously alert and ready to speak , quietly and mildly , if things should by any possibility go wrong . He was outside the trailer as the inspection proceeded , and Laskell , looking through the window , could see him sitting quietly on a rock . He was wearing an open shirt and light flannel slacks . They were Kermit 's and too tight and too long for maxim . In their failure to be negligible they were ignoble . Maxim was no longer bulging with the future . And though his scar was visible , it no longer had its old meaning . He looked , as he sat on the rock , lonely and lost . " Refrigeration ? " said Kermit , and in mild triumph he disclosed the little refrigerator , all gleaming white and purring gently . " How is that for refrigeration ? And here , " he said , and took out a huge steak and held it up for them to see , " and here is your dinner . You three are having dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steak out now . " " No ! " said Nancy. f " I do n't think steaks should be let get too cold , " Kermit eVplained . " No , we ca n't do that , Kermit . We ca n't have dinner with you . " " Of course you can . You did n't know just when we were coming so you could n't ask us , so I 'm all prepared to ask you . If you want to be formal , you can invite us tomorrow . " " Kermit  --  I ca n't eat with Gifford Maxim , " Nancy said , as preciselyas possible to clear away Kermit 's misunderstanding . And some part of that undeveloped gift of Kermit Simpson 's appeared , for in answer , quite without surprise , Kermit put his arm around Nancy 's shoulder and said , " Ah , you just ca n't imagine how easy it is . I know what you mean , but he 's not the man you think . " His arm was so simple in its friendliness and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice that Nancy had nothing to say in reply . She did not consent to come but she did not insist on the refusal . The place they found for the beautiful trailer was a patch of ground just off the road opposite the house . Kermit backed the car and trailer onto it and swung around so that the trailer 's door faced the road . They were shaded by a clump of trees . When they were established on the site , Nancy and Arthur left them but Laskellstayed behind . Simpson and Maxim brought out a folding table and folding chairs of light metal and then glasses and whisky and ice . Laskell saw in what a practiced way and with how few words they made camp . The intimacy between them seemed very sure . It had been there to be heard in Kermit 's voice when he had said to Nancy that Maxim was not the man she thought he was . He spoke as if he understood Maxim deeply . Laskell was no longer Kermit 's wise friend . That place was now held by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them all . He did it with the same quiet significance with which he would have poured his own whisky . He was careless about thep2IIamount he poured , he had not the scientist 's interest in quantity , but each time he held the bottle over the glass it was as if he were making a subtle decision that involved universal considerations . He was still giving the whole of his attention to the drinks and he did not look at Laskell when he said , " How are you feeling , John ? Did you make the trip all right ? I was worried about you . " " Worried ? Why were you worried ? " Maxim went on with what he was doing . Then he looked at Laskell with all his irony . Only the impossibility of Maxim 's knowing what had happened on the trip kept Laskell from believing that Maxim knew all about it . " You were on the verge , " Maxim said , as if it were pretty dull that he had to make any explanation . If Laskell were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " On the verge of what ? " he would get no other answer than that look of irony again . Maxim had the trick of really good fortune-tellers and palmists , of putting things so generally and so dramatically that what was said had to have some sort of relevant meaning , and then if you asked them what they meant , they looked at you with mockery and annoyance , as if you were being willfully stupid , you with all your intelligence and sensitivity . But in Maxim 's mockery there was now a new element , a kind of weariness . He still pretended to his knowledge of hidden motive , but the hidden things he pretended now to see were different from the hidden things he had pretended to see before . He looked at Laskell as if he were saying that there was now a virtue in what he saw . He smiled , as if in this obtuse and stubborn Laskell he saw things that made him very tender and forgiving . But he would not explain and he said very little during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported his observations of New England  --  for he did not want it to be thought that his trip had been wholly for pleasure  --  Maxim sat squinting in the sun smoking cigarettes and drinking whisky . Nancy came to dinner . Whatever she felt toward Maxim , she came with at least some good will to the occasion , for she had piled her hair high on her head to display her ears in an almost ceremoniousnakedness and she looked very pretty . But she kept herselfp2I2 remote , as if she had made an agreement with Arthur about her behavior and was living up to it as gallantly as she could . She said nothing to Maxim and did not look at him . Kermit had a fire going and the table set . His salad was ready for the dressing , the potatoes were nearly done . For cocktails he had brought champagne of a modest vintage , for he planned this as a festive occasion , and the two bottles were icing in a bucket . Kermit was a good practical cook , silent and without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about cookery . He had learned from guides and fellow hunters , not from chefs or books . When their glasses were filled , they all made that queer little abortive gesture of modern people when they drink wine , an embarrasseddirecting of the glass at the company  --  they can not completelycarry out so archaic a ritual as drinking to anyone , yet they can not quite let the custom die . But Kermit said in his mild voice , from his great height , making the occasion specific , " We must drink to the new assistant editor of The New Era . " He said it in just the right voice to make it graciousbut not solemn , and raised his glass'toward Maxim . Maxim dropped his eyes . They drank to Maxim , all except Nancy , who twirled her glass and looked at the bubbles with curiosity . In the still air they could hear the snapping of Kermit 's fire as it burned down to the coals he wanted . Arthur and Laskell looked thoughtful . Arthur said , " John told us about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do now ? " Since it was clear that so far as work went , Maxim was employed by The New Era , Arthur must have meant that he wanted to know what Maxim was going to do about his political life . Arthurhad asked the question in full good nature . He did not expect the answer he received and perhaps did not deserve it . " I 'm going to secure my safety , Arthur , " Maxim said courteously . Arthur 's face darkened . He did not reply at once but seemed to wait for the first flush of his anger to subside . Then he said , " Do you mean that ? " Maxim said with the same soft courtesy , " Yes , I mean it . " " It 's a hell of a thing to say  --  and mean . " Arthur spoke with the direct intention of insulting Maxim . But then he seemed to havep213heard the calculated note of contempt in his voice and he said earnestly , almost pleadingly , " tiff , I 'm sure you 're mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur , you may of course think so . You asked me and I told you . " " But it 's so unlike you  --  it 's such a reactionary thing to say ! " Perhaps it was an impulse of kindness in Arthur that made his voice so boyish , made it seem as if he were not appealing to Maxim'sbetter nature against his reactionariness but against his being unsportsmanlike , or even , going back a few decades , caddish . Maxim said , " That depends upon what you mean by revolutionary . Or perhaps , whatever you do mean by revolutionary , I really am what you say  --  perhaps I am reactionary . " But Kermit would have none of that . " Cut it out , Giff , we 've been through that . I do n't know that I agree with all your ideas , but you 're not reactionary . " Maxim shrugged , refusing argument . Kermit said , " I agree with you in certain respects that things in the Soviet Union are not what we ought to admire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , and I 'm a little ashamed of myself for not having said it openly enough in The New Era . After all , we are a libertarian paper , and if a revolutionary experiment curtailsfreedom even temporarily , we ought to say so . And say it openly . After all , that 's the only way we are going to bring about any change : by saying things openly . And we have the right to say them , especially if we have a full realization that it is an experimentand that every social experiment , no matter how liberal its ultimate aims , is bound to generate certain contradictions and difficultiesof a temporary sort . But it 's absurd to call that position reactionary . " " That is not my position , " said Maxim . But at the same moment Nancy said , " And you are going to say that kind of thing in The New Era , Kermit ? " Kermit preferred to answer Nancy 's question rather than Maxim'sdenial . " Yes , " Kermit said . " I 've had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . You know how those things can be . In the back of your mind you have a vague feeling of illogicality , but it does n't come to the fore until something brings it there . After all , civil liberties are civil liberties , no matter where and no matter what the underlying philosophy of the particularstate that negates them . " He turned to Maxim again and repeated what he had concluded before . " But Giff , it 's just perverse to call such a view reactionary . " Maxim shrugged again . " Call it what you like , " he said rather brutally . He helped himself to champagne , drank it off , and filled his glass again . " Call it what you like . It 's your position , not mine , so call it what you like . Names do n't bother me as much as they bother you . They do n't bother me at all . I 've tried to tell you , Simpson , I 've tried to tell you for weeks now what I think and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . I do n't think I 'll ever make you understand  --  it 's not in your nature , it 's not in your good-nature , to know what I 'm talking about . But I want you to be sure that I tried . I 'm taking a job with you simply because  --  " " Yes , I know , " Kermit said , smiling . His smile showed that he was hurt by Maxim 's tone , but was trying not to be . " I know . You 're simply using ' me . You 've told me that . All right . But I 'm using you too . Do n't forget that  --  I 'm using you just as much as you 're using me . There 's an area where we do n't agree . I grant that . I grant that I do n't understand that area . There are some things about you that I suppose I never will understand . Your bitterness and hopelessness and the way you overstate things . But I 've made plenty of use of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'll learn more still . " It was irresistibly disarming , even for Maxim . And Maxim admittedthat he was disarmed . He was looking at Kermit with a sour irony , a kind of bitterly grudging admiration of Kermit 's method of argument . Kermit had disarmed him with his boyish earnestness and Maxim scented to be admitting that this , after all , was an effective technique , as effective as one of his own . Laskell thought that it came very naturally to both Arthur and Kermit to be boyish when they were earnest . Maxim said with a final fatigue , as if there were no arguing with Kermit , " O.K. " But then he revived and said , " But get it straight , Simpson . You do n't understand . That 's right , you do n't . But you do n't even know what it is you do n't understand . " Kermit made a little gesture with his head and mouth and eyebrows , as if to say that that might well be but that he had his ownp215opinion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time they had been together . Kermit had learned how to take the bullying gracefully , with a little gesture to indicate an opinion held in reserve . For a moment they sat silent , waiting to see if Kermit would reply beyond his gesture . But Kermit did not say anything . Nancy said , " No , he does n't understand . " She said it very quietly . She meant that she understood but that a person of Kermit'sinnocence would naturally not understand the depravity to which Maxim was confessing . She said in the same quiet voice , " Why did you come here , Maxim ? " Her addressing him by his last name carried the question out of the present moment and immediate scene into a clear abstract realm of morality where perhaps the matter belonged . It was very striking . Laskell had been calling him Giff , and even Arthur , when he was most contemptuous , had called him Giff . Maxim looked down into his empty glass on the table . He took the stem between two fingers and twirled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bulk . He was smoking a cigarette and it had burned down to as small a butt as possible . He took one more pull at it , slowly , shutting one eye as the smoke curled up and stung it . He looked at Nancy and dryly said , " For purposes of corruption , I suppose you 'd say . " He dropped the cigarette and ground it carefullyinto the earth with his toe . " That is exactly what I do say . You did your best to draw us in and now you 'd like to undo your work . By every lie and insinuationyou can utter . " She had risen and was standing with her clenched fist pressing down hard upon the table for support . But she was very quiet . It was impossible to interfere . They were both so quiet and kept the matter so precisely between them that none of the three men was able to enter the conflict to turn it . " Draw you in ? " Maxim said with surprise . And his voice was filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bows and curtsies , the fauteuils and carpets of many civilizations , as he returned the shot that Nancy had fired with such effect a moment before . " You are mistaken , Croom , " he said softly . It was more terrible than Nancy 's " Maxim " and Nancy flinched under it . They all flinched under it . They all saw what Maxim wanted them to see . They saw it even though it was a travesty that Maxim had conjured up  --  the committee-room in which politics was brought to the ultimate issue , in which , since the issues were final and lives were staked on them , the antagonists stripped themselves as much as possible of their ordinary human conditions , and of their names kept only what was essential for identification , Nancy giving up anything so charged with the irrelevant conditionof femininity as Nancy or Mrs. Croom . For a moment Maxim let them take it in and then he said , " You are quite mistaken . I did n't draw you in . The dialectic of the situation "  --  hisvoice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on  --  " mind you , - the dialectic of the situation detached certain disaffected portions of the middle class from their natural class interests and connections , and attached them to the interests of the oppressed classes . " There was insult in his language . But his tone was politely explanatory . " You happened to be part of that disaffected portion of the middle class . It was not that you consciously responded to externalnecessities but rather that you expressed certain internal conflicts which reflected contradictions in the world outside . " As he went on it became clear that he was not insulting Nancy but rather the language that he was using . The force of his attention was not on Nancy now , but on his own words . He said , and closed his eyes and changed his cadence to show that he was quoting , " I should be the last to hold the individual responsible for conditions whose creature he himself is , socially considered , however much he may raise himself above them subjectively . ' I think that is verbatim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called the inexorable logic of the situation  --  you were drawn only to the ideational aspects of the movement , to the emotional superstructure of the movement , not to its base in reality . So much so , that when I made one single attempt to  --  as you say  --  draw you in , to involve you in the more practical aspects of the movement , I had no success whatever . I asked three of you  --  John Laskell and Arthur and yourself  --  to do a certain thing , to receive certain letters of great importance . You all three , every one of you , refused . And when I thought that perhaps I ought not take Ar/I7thur 's refusal as valid for his wife , too , and asked you again , when you were alone , whether you would give me this help , you refused again . With his eyes on Nancy 's face , Laskell saw that Maxim 's odd point of honor had been communicated . He saw the puzzled , stopped look that Nancy wore as she understood what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her he would not even now betrayher secret . She had opened her mouth to reply . She had been on the point of replying to this man she so hated . But he had stopped her , if only for this moment . But Arthur said , " Maxim ! Do you mean to say that after we both refused together , you went and asked Nancy by herself ? " " Yes . But she refused . " " That was a fine , son-of-a-bitch thing to do , " said Arthur . " It was , " said Maxim . Then he explained demurely , " But you see , I was a member of the Party then . " Arthur had nothing to answer and Maxim went on with his lectureto Nancy . " So you see , I have very little hope of drawing you one way or another . You will go the way of the dialectic , whatever way that happens to be for you , and so , no doubt , will I. You can be sure that the thesis is now being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaffected portions of the professional revolutionaryclass will be infected by the virus of the rotting bourgeoisculture from which they originally sprang on the impulse to make the revolution serve their individualistic aspirations for romanticaction and utopian morality and will betray their revolutionarycommitments to wallow in the slime of idealism from which they came . ' In a short time I will be known as Maxim &; Co . Perhaps you yourself can see the froth of the counter-revolutionary mad-dog on my mouth . As for you , you will , I hope , go a nobler way . " They were all silent , deeply embarrassed . Even Kermit felt that Maxim had gone too far . He got up and laid the steak on the grill . Laskell had been complexly moved by the outburst , for he had only once before seen Maxim yield so completely to merely personalfeeling . Yet at the same time that he felt an obscure pity , he felt a kind of disgust . Maxim might be right in all he said about the movement , but Laskell was sure he would never again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good the reasons , he thought , that make a man desert his cause , he will always be unpleasant to see , his moral equilibrium will never restore itself . Better , perhaps , to stay in the self-hatred of an enforced conformity than to enter the self-suspicion of even reasoned and justifiable treachery . The spectacle of Maxim was shocking enough to carry Arthur past his anger . It was as if one could not be angry with a Maxim in this condition . Arthur said , " Giff ! " using again that boyish note of straightforward appeal that was so winning . He tried to recall Maxim to his former and better self . " Giff ! What brought you to this point ? " It was clear that Maxim could not be given a single opening , for now he lifted his head and looked at Arthur , his lower lip caught reflectively between his teeth , and said very gravely , " There was a fly in it . " It took them all a moment to recall the dirty joke with whose tag Maxim had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levity of the answer . But Arthur was not to be drawn into anger again . He said , as if Maxim had given him a perfectly satisfactory reply , " What 's your position then ? " " Position ? " " Yes , position , " Arthur said , his mouth now set and his jaw out . Maxim gave way . " I have no position , Arthur , " he said kindly . " At the moment I am hors de combat . Simpson has given me a job on his magazine at  --  what is it ?  --  forty dollars a week . I 'll work for Simpson for a while , at least until I am sufficiently established , and then I 'll see . I 've lost , you know , the work of nearly half my life . " It was true  --  nearly half a life . This they knew , this even Nancy knew , but she was evidently not willing to let herself be touched by it . She said , " But meanwhile , all the suffering people all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they die in their misery ? " For a moment Maxim did not answer . Then , " Is it not strange , " he said , " do you not find it strange that as we become more sensitive to the sufferings of mankind , we become more and more cruel ? The more we think of the human body and the human mind asp219being able to suffer , and the sorrier we feel for that , and the more we plan to prevent suffering , the more we are drawn to inflict suffering . The more tortures we think up . The more people we believedeserve to be tortured . The more we think that people can be ruled by fear of suffering . We have become our brother 's keeper  --  and we will keep him in fear , we will keep him in concentration camps , we will keep him in straitjackets , we will keep him in the grave . " He was speaking in a quiet , a too quiet , voice . They could see the sweat breaking out on his forehead . He rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other glasses were empty . He stood there with the bottle in his hand and then gave it to Laskell to fill the glasses . I-le may have believed that the others would not accept wine from him . " And never has there been so much talk of liberty while the chains are being forged . Democracy and freedom . And in the most secret heart of every intellectual , where he scarcely knows of it himself , there lies hidden the real hope that these words hide . It is the hope of power , the desire to bring his ideas to reality by imposingthem on his fellow man . We are all of us , all of us , the little children of the Grand Inquisitor . The more we talk of welfare , the crueller we become . How can we possibly be guilty when we have in mind the welfare of others , and of so many others ? " " We ? " It was Nancy who asked the question . He sat there gloomily , not answering . " Why do you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made . Do you mean that we can think of the Nazis , that we can think of the cruelties of the Falangists in Spain  --  and still say we ' ? I should think that very sharp distinctions could be drawn between such people and the decent people . " He said nothing . " Do n't you ? " she said to awaken him from his silence . " No . " They were all relaxed by this . It was now clear that they were not dealing with an opinion but with a condition . They could take it more lightly , or with more pity . " You really do n't ? " said Nancy with an air of having reached the end of the argument.  | " The heart  --  " Maxim said , and for a quick strange moment Laskellvividly saw Emily at his side on the river-bank and heard her , as she spoke of Susan 's illness , refer so to the child 's infirmity . " My heart  --  " Maxim said , his voice taking on a lyric or elegiac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had deepened , that the tops of the trees were being stirred by a breeze that did not move the leaves of the lower branches , so that the trees murmured in a far-off way . The image , or rather the idea , of Emily Caldwell was intensely present to Laskell , and he suddenly felt that it carried him outside the circle of his friends , beyond their dispute and the reasons for it , making strangers of all of them , Nancy and Arthur , Kermit and Maxim . " My own heart , " said Maxim , " is full of hatred and pity . Sometimes I can not tell one from the other . When I feel the hatred I know it is generated by pity . And when I feel the pity I know it is generated by hatred . And when I do not feel either one or the other , then it is only emptiness , only emptiness . But whenever I feel anything at all , it is for all . All . We are all members one of another . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have been in Spain , and I have seen Kermit Simpson shot and worse , and Nancy Croom shot and worse , and John Laskelland Arthur Croom . And myself . And I have helped . I have done it . You have helped . And even if I had not been there to see , I would know that I was involved . I am involved in the cruelties I have never seen and never will see . On both sides . You think only of what the other side must do to gain its ends and you feel separated from everything that is foul in them . But I know what our ' side must do , and not merely do ; the doing would not be so terrible if we did not have to be what we do , and I know what we must be . " The voice ceased its lilting , for Maxim had been speaking in a kind of sing-song . They all sat silent . None of them had ever heard anything like this before , this much devastation of spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It seems to me , Giff , that you have lost your sense of community with men in their suffering and goodness and found it only in their cruelty and evil . " Maxim dropped his eyes as if to consider what Laskell had said ,  |p221and  then raised them and looked at Laskell with his face all exposed . He said simply and conclusively , " Yes . " It seemed as complete as an admission could be and it made him entirely the object of their hushed regard . It cut him off from them except for their awareness of his self-torture . They could not argue with him . And his aberration was so great and so open that it could not contaminate them . It was as if he had said that he was soon to die of a disease that could not possibly be contagious . Kermit got up and went to the fire . He put the steak on its wooden board and held it out for them to see . " Ready ! " he called . " Sit down . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to Kermit 's call and disregarding the fact that the others had risen to take their places at the table , " but perhaps that will mislead you about the nature of my community . My community with men is that we are children of God . " At this they all paused in their movement and looked at Maxim , , who had not yet stirred . There had been nothing to say to Maxim 's reply to Laskell 's question and there was nothing to say now to his further statement . It came as an anticlimax , which was perhaps what Maxim wanted it to be , a remark to be heard and ignored on the way to dinner . They seated themselves at the table , but Maxim stayed where he was , silent , until Kermit called , " Come and partake , Giff , come and partake . " He said to the others , " Now you know what it is I do n't understand . " Maxim got up and brought his chair to the table and took his place at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words had produced a certain solemnity and from it he himself was not excluded  --  it seemed that he was nearer to them now that he had shown how very far away he was . Kermit carved , of course , with great skill , slicing the steak diagonallyinto inch-thick slabs , and the others did what best suited the situation , they talked about the steak . They praised Kermit for the perfect gradation of its color from black char through brown and pink to red and they went on to talk learnedly of the various theories of broiling steak . It was mooted whether a steak should first be coated with olive oil as some people advocated , and ques- tions were raised about whether the prevailing method of quickly searing the steak was as good as it was said to be . Maxim stayed in the isolation of his announced belief and drank the red wine that Kermit had opened . Once he got up and looked to the coffee that was being prepared in the galley of the trailer and came back and took his place silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the possibility of any further discussionand all of them were able to chat quite easily among themselves . Yet they were all a little relieved when they heard footsteps and Duck Caldwell appeared in the deepening twilight . " Do n't want to disturb you folks at dinner , " Duck said . Kermit had risen and stood in a host 's attitude . The paper napkinin his hand had almost the appearance of damask , so gracious was his stance . Duck looked at Kermit with his mocking self-possessionand said , " Do n't disturb . I heard about the trailer and I thought maybe I could get a look for myself . " Nancy said , " Kermit Simpson , Duck Caldwell , " and made a little gesture with her two hands to bring them together . Kermit , looking awkward in his size beside Duck , put out his hand and said , " Happy to meet you , Mr. Caldwell . You 're not disturbingus at all . " For a moment Nancy hesitated and then she said , " Mr. Maxim , Mr. Caldwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to revive Nancy 's antagonism , it was the curt nod that Maxim gave Duck and the almost baleful look from lowered eyes . Kermit was quick , almost too quick , to escort Duck into the trailer , to turn on the lights and then to leave him to his own and the trailer 's devices . They were silent as Duck inspected the trailer , as if waiting for some verdict for which he had withdrawn . He came out at last and said to Kermit , " Mighty fine thing you have . But that 's no job for a poor man now , is it ? That 's no factory job  --  looks to me custom-built . " " Well yes , yes it is . Yes , you 're right  --  it was made to order . " Kermit spoke in admiration of Duck 's cleverness in seeing that it was custom-built . He was feeling the weight of his wealth and privilege and the cleverer he could make Duck the less guilty hep223would have to be . His discomfort made him as explicit as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people at the factory . I worked with a man named Norton , very intelligent man . " He seemed to cling to Norton , for like.many wealthy people Kermit liked to conjureup the personality of the artisans who had made the things they owned , speaking of their tailors and cabinet makers in all the odd quirks of their little , ordinary humanity , with the result that the things they owned , their suits and their furniture , seemed to cost nothing at all and derived what litt  --  value they had only from the human quality of the men who had made them . " But some of the ready-made jobs are first-rate . They really are , very well designed , very comfortable . There was one I seriously considered for a time and almost took it . " " But you did n't , " said Duck with great clarity . " No . That 's right , I bought this one . " " Well , " said Duck , not much inclined to press his advantage , " if you ever get tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  right here . " And he poked his chest with his forefinger . " That 's living , a thing like that . If I had a car and a set-up like you got here , I could get me out to California the right way . " " Oh , " said Kermit , relieved that Duck had his own freedom and plans for pleasure . " Are you thinking of going to California ? " " I 'm thinking , " said Duck . " But that 's all I 'm doing . " He was so apart from them all . He stood there small and resistantand envious . Things were going on inside his head and at this moment he was not justifying himself to anyone . He was not making a connection with any of them , and not trying . He did not even , just now , have a connection with Arthur and Nancy . They all sat before him , except Kermit , who stood . Their good will was not enough to overcome their superiority . Kermit , who defended Duck 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the talk was true , might be one of Duck 's servants in Washington ; Nancy , who conceived for Duck the saving myth of his oppression , honesty , and inner strength  --  none of them could make the connection . Maxim , who had once had a gift for " making contact " with the underprivileged , just sat and glared at this slight , tight , excluded figure . Why Maxim seemed so hostile Laskell could not guess , but he knew that the others were being held at bay by the accusation Duck was subtly making , which had reference to the steak and the wine and the salad bowl and the trailer . Perhaps of them all it was John Laskell who came closest to Duck at that moment . Nancy made an effort but she did not do very well . In fact , she went quite off her usual line . She said , " Who knows ? Maybe with luck , some day  --  " It was like a mother carelessly trying to pacify a child with the offer of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment worse . " No , not the way things are , Mrs. Groom . There have to be big changes before I get anything like that . " Well , he had a kind of courage  --  he looked straight at Kermit Simpson , looked at him meaningfully , out of his isolation and bitterness . He had the courage to know in his subtle way that these people were ashamed before him , especially Kermit . So he stood and looked at Kermit . There was no theory in the look , just a personalmeasuring , and Kermit standing with his napkin must have had the sense that he was a great deal too tall as well as a great deal too wealthy . They heard Emily Caldwell 's voice saying , " Good evening ! " She came with Susan in her wake . Nancy seemed almost glad to see her , glad perhaps for Duck to have someone close to him here . She said most cordially , " Oh , good evening , Mrs. Caldwell . " She made the introductions and Kermit offered Emily his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that she had come only becauseSusan wanted to see the trailer , but Laskell saw how her glance went to the wine bottles and the glasses and he knew that she had her own reasons for coming . She had been afraid that they would start Duck drinking . This time it was Maxim who rose to demonstrate the trailer . He had responded to this introduction very differently , had smiled with great openness to Emily , and had said to Susan in a very directway that he was glad to meet her . He put his arm around Susan 's shoulder and put out his hand to help Emily up the steps . " Wo n't you join us in a glass of wine , Mr. Caldwell ? " said Kermit . And Duck screwed his head about and considered and said , " Do n't mind if I do . " But when Kermit came back from the trailer with the twop225glasses he went to fetch , Emily Caldwell was with him . Emily firmly took the glasses from him and put them on the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't stay , " she said . And she called , " Susan ! " She said , " We 'd love to stay but we ca n't . But I hope we 'll be seeing all of you at ot1T Church Bazaar tomorrow . You gentlemen will be here that long I hope . Do come . Oh , not that it will be anything it 's nothing really  --  but you might like to see it . " And she called again , " Susan dear ! " Duck stood with the sour look of a man whose rational pleasures are being interfered with . Susan put her head out of the door of the trailer and said , " Yes , Mother ? " and Emily went to her and drew her down the steps though the child was protesting that she had not yet seen everything . " Oh , let her stay , Mrs. Caldwell ! " Kermit pleaded warmly for Susan . " And you and your husband stay and have a glass of wine with us . " " Yes , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really  --  " said Emily . Laskell saw her deep apprehension , saw Duck standing there smiling and grim . She was not now the woman he had known on the bank of the little river , she was confused and distracted . Yet she was that woman and he stood up and went to Susan . " You can come back tomorrow , Susan , and work all the gadgets . Mr. Simpsonand Mr. Maxim will be glad to have yoj . I 'll come too and you can make tea for us on the stove if you 'd like . Would you like that ? " " Yes , I would , " Susan said decisively . So it was settled and Emily Caldwell was able to sweep her familytogether and away from the dinner party . She was fussy and nervous and her " Good night  --  good night all , " rang without gratificationin Laskell 's ears . And he got no pleasure from her air of social authority as she said to Nancy , " Mrs , Croom , you will bring all your friends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone , a fresh heaviness descended on the failure of the dinner party . " Are they natives here ? Are they farmiiag people ? " Kermit said . " He is native , but she 's not , " Nancy said . " She comes from Hartford . "  | " Are they farming people ? " " Not exactly . " Nancy said it defensively . " He works at odd jobs . He 's a very good carpenter . " " The little girl is sweet , " said Kermit . " The husband is a very remarkable person . But the wife  --  " And Nancy shrugged . Maxim spoke . " Remarkable , yes . I know the type  --  the criminal personality with the strong , narrow streak of intellect . " He spoke with a remote objectivity , as if from notes . " It 's a modern type and extremely useful in making revolutions . It has to be liquidated eventually , either by changing its character or by  --  or in other ways . Some examples of it can be converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much . You see something of the same sort of thing in the middle , class too . But in the middle class the deep , narrow envy runs more to intellect , to the envy of ideas and of personalities . " " Oh , Giff , come off it , " said Kermit . Maxim shrugged . Nancy spoke from such depths of revulsion that her voice was scarcely agitated . And what she said almost seemed to be spoken in friendliness . " Oh , something terrible has happened to you , " she said . " It has  --  something terrible . You have only to hear someone speak with a sense of his class and you hate him and traduce him . What kind of change has taken place in you ? What do you think men are ? Only a few months ago you would have been interested in that man , " and she pointed in the direction Duck had gone , " and you would have admired him and tried to politicalize him . Now you call him a criminal type  --  exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had your class advantages , or any of ours , he would be something positive , a leader . Of that I 'm sure . He 's wasted here , I admit that  --  he never had a chance and his wife is a fool . But to you he 's nothing but a criminal type . " " Look here  --  " Laskell had broken in . It was impossible for him to hear Emily spoken of so disparagingly . " Nevertheless  --  " said Maxim stolidly . But Laskell was not heard and Nancy was not to be stopped . " When John told me what had happened to you , I could scarcely believe it , I was horrified . Then , when I read that article of yours ,  |p227I  thought , John did not get things quite straight . ' I thought that the man who wrote that might be wrong in many respects , or confused , but such a man could not be actually counter-revolutionary . He knows that things can not be judged by absolutes , that a great social experiment must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered realistically . " Maxim 's face seemed to have lightened and he leaned forward as if now for the first time he did not have to deal with something that was old and stale . His leaning forward was not the preface to an interruption but an invitation to Nancy to go on . " You seemed to be admitting that certain things could not be judged by mere liberal standards . A ship , a state that is surrounded by enemies , can not afford the liberal notions of justice . And I thought , Maxim is n't one of those weak souls who has got all upsetby the trials  --  and  --  and things like that . ' But now I see I was wrong . You 're worse than I thought . " " Nevertheless , " Maxim said , " your man is a criminal type . " He stopped just long enough to drive home his point . " At least to the extent that he 's gone off with a pint of Kermit 's whisky . " " What are you talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure Kermit will agree . But there were five pint bottles of bourbon in the locker and now there are only four . As I saw when I showed the trailer to the little girl . " With the irony of misery and desperation Nancy said , " I scarcely think a pint of whisky will ruin Kermit . " " Oh , scarcely , " said Maxim in hearty agreement . " I do n't care in the least , " Kermit said . " And I think what we ought to do is open one of the four bottles and have a drink . " He looked around at his friends hoping for cooperation toward sociability . " And I 'll get a lamp , " he said . For it was nearly dark . " No , " said Arthur . " We must go now , Kermit . Nancy has to get to bed early . " They left after brief farewells . Kermit went into the trailer to get the whisky , turning as he went to say to Laskell , " You 'll stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll stay a while . " He felt an odd , dry balance of mind . He felt he would be equally alone whether he went or stayed and he liked the feeling.  | When he and Maxim were alone , Maxim said , " You read my essay , John ? " " Yes , I did . " " And you did n't interpret it the same way , I gather ? " " No . " " What did you take it to mean ? " " It seemed very explicit . " Here was Maxim asking questions again . But Laskell had no worry about his answers . " You said that this world was the field of Law and Necessity not of Justice and Freedom . You denied in effect the possibility of the ultimate social aims of revolution . It seemed when I read it that you spoke from a religious point of view and that , as I gathered tonight , was correct . " He said it in a dry indifferent voice . Maxim had asked for the interpretation and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " Maxim said . " That 's right , of course . And that view "  --  here Maxim 's voice became tentative , almost humble  --  " that view of things , does it interest you at all ? " " No . " Laskell recognized Maxim 's recoil of disappointment . It was so out of the nature of things to have Maxim only disappointed that he almost added some words of explanation to blur his answer . Then he decided to say nothing more . For a moment they sat without speaking . Then Maxim said , " You 're having an affair with Caldwell 's wife , are n't you ? " Laskell 's apprehension and anger rose simultaneously . Then he thought that Maxim was very clever and that what he saw would not necessarily be seen by anyone else , and he thought that Maxim needed to show how much power of cleverness he had . He said , " That 's none of your business , Maxim . " " I knew it from the way you spoke to the child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you arc , John , " Maxim said with a touch of his old , almost maternal tenderness . " She looks like a real woman . " There still seemed to Laskell no reason to answer . Maxim said , " What 's the matter , John ? Have you decided to hate me ? " " No , " Laskell said . " Just entirely finished with me ? Is that it ? " THE MIDDLE OF THE JOURNEY 229 " Yes . " " And with a lot of other things too ? " " That 's none of your business either . " Kermit came out with three highballs in his hand . He had things to say about the unfortunateness of political disputes when unity among people of good will was so necessary . He spoke about Nancy 's overwrought state  --  " Though I confess , " he said , " that I . never thought she had that good a mind "  --  and he chided Maxim gently for having let himself be provoked by Nancy and provoking her in return . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent with the others . Laskell drank half his drink and rose to go . " I 'll see you tomorrow , " he said . Maxim said , " Do n't forget you asked Susan to come for tea . " " So I did . I 'll pick her up and bring her about three . " He had not gone far on the road to the Folgers ' when he heard a whistle and saw the butt of a beam of light on the trees on the road . He turned , holding his own flashlight to mark his place , and waited for Kermit Simpson to come up the road . " I 'll walk you to your place , " said Kermit . " Is it far ? I need the exercise . " " Not very far . What 's the matter ? " " Nothing 's the matter . I told Giff I wanted to ask you about fishing . But it 's pretty late in the season . What I wanted to ask you about is Giff . Do n't tell him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , do you believe what he says ? " " About God ? " " No , that 's just his way of talking . He does n't mean it . No  --  about the Party . Do you think he 's telling the truth about his danger ? " " Do n't you ? " " I do n't know . He seems to be . But I just ca n't believe such things . Think of the people we know . Do you believe it ? You sent him to me , you must believe it . " Laskell walked on a way without saying anything . Then he said , " You took him on , you must believe it . " " I took him on because he was in trouble , or said he was . I didn't make up my mind one way or the other . I 've always admired Giffhiscourage and his intelligence . And his commitment . He 's a terriblycommitted man . You have n't said whether you believe it or not  --  you keep putting me off . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a while Laskell gave him no answer at all . They passed the Caldwell house , which was all dark . Laskell did not let himself think of Duck and Emily . He did not know whether or not he believedMaxim 's story of his danger . Ever since Maxim had told it , he had suspended his answer and turned off the question . It did not seem a question for him . But now he supposed he had to answer . He had a certain responsibility to Kermit Simpson , for he had brought Kermit and Maxim together . He said , " Suppose it were true , Kermit ? What then ? " And Kermit 's answer came immediately and solemnly . " It would be terrible to contemplate . We would have lost one of our guideposts , one of our guiding principles . The alternatives we face now would not be the same . In fact , John , I 'd go so far as to say that it would make political thought as we now know it impossible . " Kermit 's flashlight was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laskell had put out his own . In the intense white beam all the stones on the road stood clear and distinct and the dust rose brown and powdery up to the height of their knees . " Would it really ? " Laskell asked . " Oh  --  impossible ! " said Kermit . Laskell had asked his question , " Would it really ? " with a certain irony . It was directed toward Kermit 's almost boyish innocence . He thought of himself at that moment as wise and scarred by experience . He became , as it were , the Maxim to Kermit 's Laskell , taking an instant 's cruel pleasure in his power to throw this good man beyond his habitual alternatives . But irony and cruelty passed . They yielded to the knowledge of Kermit 's wish to be a good man and to do his duty as he saw it . Kermit already knew the truth about Maxim , yet when Laskell would put it into words , Kermit would be pained by it . Laskell could anticipate no superiority in inflicting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surely he had learned a respect for the innocent heart . He said softly , " Kermit , I believe Maxim is telling the truth . "  | " You do ? You really do ? " And Kermit swung around , flashlight and all , so that the beam was directed at Laskell 's belly and lit up their faces and bodies grotesquely . " Oh  --  sorry . " Kermit turned away the light as Laskell 's hand went up to protect his eyes from the glare . " Sorry , " said Kermit again . " Then you really believe he 's telling the truth . " Laskell heard the heavy , sorry tone in Kermit 's voice . " Yes , I do . " " But what makes you believe it ? After all , we only have Giff 's word for it . " " Look here , Kermit , " Laskell said . " If you think Maxim is lying , tell him to get the hell off your staff . You do n't owe him anything . If you thought he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Kermit said ruefully , reluctantly , " Yes . That 's so , is n't it ? But he seemed to be in trouble , so I helped him . " " He was in a particular kind of trouble and you gave him a particularkind of help . If you did n't believe him , you could have helped him some other way  --  given him money maybe . " And then , because Kermit seemed to emanate a childlike bewilderment , Laskellsaid , " Look , Kermit . Belief is difficult and complicated . You believe this , but you do n't want to believe it . " " Can you blame me ? " Kermit cried . " Do you want to believe it ? " His voice was agonized . " Shush  --  you 'll wake the people . " " Sorry , " Kermit whispered . " Can you blame me ? " he whispered . And in a whisper he said , " Not that I 've ever considered myself a Communist , or even a fellow-traveler . Everybody knows that . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to you about this . Nothing has ever needed more thought . " " Perhaps not . But not now , Kermit . " " There are some things , " Kermit whispered , " some ideas that we ca n't abandon . We will have to select very carefully . " " Very carefully , " said Laskell . " But we will make the selection tomorrow . " " Do n't joke about it , John , " said Kermit hoarsely . " It 's just that I 'm sleepy . " " Sorry  --  I should n't keep you . "  | " We 'll talk about it , Kermit . Do n't let it throw you . " There was now no teasing in his voice . , " No . Well , good night . " Laskell watched the progress of his deprived friend as Kermit went off up the road , his bright light cutting the darkness ahead of him.  | HAD Kermit asked him what ground he had for believingMaxim , Laskell could not have given him the true answer . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is telling the truth because of what I have learned about the Crooms . " He could not tellKermit that the summer had shown him a kind of passion inNancy Croom  --  in his Nancy , whom he had so much admired  --  the ultimate consequence of which might logically be just such an actof destruction as Maxim feared for himself . When Maxim had firstreported the danger in which he lived , it had seemed the fantasyof a corrupted intelligence or the contrivance of a malign one . ButLaskell had come to Crannock and strange things had happened . Abysses of feeling had opened between him and his friends . Hehad seen in Nancy a passion of the mind and will so pure that , asit swept through her , she could not believe that anything thatopposed it required consideration . When orie had a reference aslarge as Nancy 's , when it was something as big as the future orreality to which one conceived oneself dedicated , nothing couldpossibly have the right to call it to account. , Arthur 's dedicationwas not so absolute , yet even Arthur 's instinctive knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact and the paradoxes ofpower , which Laskell had always thought of as the armor of Arthur'sidealism , now presented themselves in a different light . Arthurdid not flare into shining affirmations as Nancy did ; he evenmocked them in Nancy and spoke out to moderate their extravagance . Yet he needed Nancy 's absolute intransigence . He mighttease his wife for the fierceness of her spirit , but he was charmedand excited by the feminine boldness with which she was ready tochallenge the world . And he needed her extravagance and ardor assupport to his own cooler idealism : it was as if his concern with fact and practicality was then a correction of her excess rather than a limitation of his own moral vision . Nancy made the affirmations  --  Arthur did not have to make them but only to be husband to the passion from which they came . It was thus that he assured both the masculinity and impersonality of his own more muted political attitude . Laskell had not thought of the Crooms when he gave Kermit his answer . The answer had come merely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone off up the road with that excessiveflashlight of his and Laskell was alone in his room , he had to ask himself why he had answered Kermit with so much certitude . And only then did the reason formulate itself clearly . What surprised him was that he had no unhappy emotions about this discovery , although it was not a very pleasant one . Nor did he have any unhappy emotions about his avowal to Kermit , although it was of the greatest importance . As soon as he made it , he was aware of a large vacancy in his thought  --  it was the place where the Party and the Movement had been . It was also the place where Nancy and Arthur had been . The Party represented what he would reach if he ever really developed in intelligence , virtue , and courage , and the Grooms had pointed out the way he must travel to reach this high estate . He had often thought that he would never reach it by following the path of his natural growth ; he had sometimes conjectured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be the sort of man who needed street-fightingand barricades  --  the open crisis of political deterioration  --  in order to come to full political maturity . But now , where there had for so long been this strength of moral ambition , there was simply a vacancy . Ile did not feel the vacancy as a loss , only as a space through which the breezes of his mind blew very freely . He thought , " I am getting middle-aged , I am beginning not to care . " The accusation carried no conviction . He did not think it true and this in itself was surprising . He had no emotion about the loss of the Party , to which , of course , he had never been " committed , " and he had no emotion about the Grooms , to whom , of course , he was very much committed . He could scarcely believe that he had lost the Grooms so far as affection went , but certainly he had lost them in their func/tion . They no longer showed him the right direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for in this . Directions are chosen by the traveler himself and signposts merely point them out once they have been chosen . And Laskell , now that he no longer required the Crooms to demand something of him , also did not need to blame them . That was the remarkable thing , the thing that surprised him most and really gave him pleasure  --  thathe could know that the Crooms no longer had their old function in his mental life , and yet not judge or banish them . The very next morning Laskell had proof of how much free room in his cosmos he still was able to give the Crooms . He had come down to breakfast and , looking in at the kitchen door , he saw that Nancy was paying an unusually early call on Mrs. Folger . She did not hear him , nor did Mrs. Folger , and he had a moment in which to see that Nancy 's face was unhappy ' even stricken , and that Mrs. Folger was busying herself about her work with the air of one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now things had better be put on a sensible basis and go on as before . Obviously Nancy had suffered a defeat of some kind . She looked puzzled as at some injustice , and Laskell , seeing her sit there , so mute in her inability to understand how anyone could be firmer than she or to remember how fierce her own firmness could be , suddenly had a strange experience : it was as if he felt intelligentall over . It was an intelligence as suffusive as love . The memory of Nancy 's cold will the night before had not been erased , and he still hated it . But he did not hate the Nancy who could summonup that cold will . The sight of Nancy herself filled him with this almost erotic intelligence . Nancy sat with him at breakfast , saying clothing of what was making her unhappy . When Laskell had finished eating she invitedhim to walk home with her , and he knew that she wanted to tell him the reason for her frustrated morning visit to Mrs. Folger . She had indeed suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information that she was to transfer her services to the Folgers ' Miss Walker . Nancy had called on Mrs. Folger to protest , for Eunice was clearly not a free agent in the choice , and Mrs. Folger had been very polite and very sorry , but had made it clear that if Miss Walker needed more help and Eunice was the help Miss Walker needed , then Nancy had to do without . And she had gone so far as to say that it was very considerate of Miss Walker not to require Eunice immediately but to offer to wait as much as four days until Nancy could find someone else who would accommodate her . " But there 's no one else to find ! " Nancy cried . " It 's so unfair ! And it 's so unfriendly . " It was the unfriendliness that seemed to rankle deepest , though the loss of Eunice to help her with Micky put Nancy to **25;1944;TOOLONG . " You ca n't think of it as a choice between two people , you and Miss Walker , " Laskell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Miss Walker . " " That 's just it . It 's degrading for them . She 's made them break their word to me  --  we agreed Eunice would work for me all summer . When they arrived at the house Arthur was standing in the road with Kermit and Maxim , who were on their way to Crannock and had stopped to see if there were any errands they might do . " There 's no appeal , " Nancy said to Arthur . " Julia Walker commandsand Eunice must go . " She was very bitter . " Julia Walker ! " Kermit cried , and his face lighted up . " What Julia Walker is that ? Is it Theron Walker 's Aunt Julia ? " Arthur said , a bit impatiently , " We 've never met her . She 's the local squiress . " " A bunchy little old lady , dresses in black ? I 'll bet it 's Theron 's Aunt Julia . " " We 've never met her , Kermit , " Nancy said . " Oh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't you ? " " Who ? " " Theron Walker , the poet . " Arthur shook his head . " I do n't think I 've ever heard of him . " " Never heard of him ? Oh , come off ! Of course you 've heard of him . " Kermit kept up with literature very conscientiously and gave it considerable space in The New Era , even though he knew that it diminished his reputation for political seriousness . He was likely to think that everyone gave as much importance to literary eventsp237as he did and he looked at Arthur incredulously . But Arthur persisted in his ignorance of Theron Walker . Kermit turned to Maxim . " You know his work , do n't you , Giff ? Why , you must have known him personally . " " Yes , " said Maxim dryly . " Why ! You knew him very well , " Kermit said , suddenly remembering . " Yes , " said Maxim . " Very well . " " Of course , " said Kermit , as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you he went to Spain . " " Yes , " said Maxim . " He died in Spain , " Kermit explained to Arthur . " Yes , " said Maxim . " I-le died in Spain . And how he died . " Nancy looked Maxim straight in the eye . Her voice was very bright and dangerous as she said , " And how did he die ? " Laskell said quickly , " I met him once . Tall , angular fellow , was n't he ? I met him twice , as a matter of fact . Was he really a good poet ? " He hoped this question might be enough to turn the line of the conversation . He did not think that this was the moment to say that he remembered talking twice to Theron Walker at some length and that he had been very engaged by the man 's bright religious earnestness for ten minutes and then bored by his inner confusion the rest of the time . He had somehow never heard that Walker had died in Spain . He was sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How did he die in Spain ? " she asked . Maxim looked at her a long time without answering . She met his look unflinchingly , waiting . At last Maxim felt that he had made it dramatic enough . He said casually , " He died by stepping on a nail , a rusty nail . There was no anti-tetanus serum and he died of lockjaw . In agony . " Nancy , who had been pushing with her whole political strength , no doubt felt almost physically cheated by meeting such an insufficient counter-force . She said helplessly , " You 're not tellingthe truth . " " You mean , " said Maxim , " you expected me to say he was shot by your friends , by my former Party . " " Well , " said Kermit , " I 'll bet this is Theron 's Aunt Julia . " Noth- ing save the need to say something had given him reason for an increasedcertainty . " She was very good to Theron and gave him money when he got into trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . You know , Aunt Julia on the Catarrh ' and the one about her dog , The Pulia of Aunt Joodle . ' The dog , " Kermit explained , " was a poodle . " Nancy took the help this offered not only for the false step she had made with Maxim but also for what it might do for her pride in the matter of Eunice . For , naturally enough , it was one thing to be deprived of Eunice in favor of a dull local squiress and quite another to have to suffer for the benefit of the favorite aunt of a dead young American poet . An Aunt Joodle with a pet pulia was something different from an unseen Miss Walker , and she asked Kermit to tell her about the poem . " It 's very witty  --  I ca n't quote any lines  --  but it gets quite serious . It describes the tricks the dog can do , and its daily life , and then it goes on to describe the descentof the dog from the days when it was wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a water-retriever , and finally the pet of an old lady . It becomes a religious poem . The idea is that the amusing , affectionate nature of the dog is Protestantism . Theronbecame a Catholic , you know . " Laskell had to control the impulse to burst into laughter . It was somehow too absurd . But Kermit 's exegesis did quiet things down . Kermit and Maxim left to do their shopping , and Laskell went with them . They had a sandwich in town and when the others had dropped him at the Folgcrs ' on their way home , Laskell walked to the church . It was the not very handsome church he passed every day , but he had never been in it . The Bazaar , he knew , was to open at one o'clock . Some exaggerated estimate of things made the ladies of the Auxiliary choose this early time to set up their tables and lay out their accumulated stock . They may have dreamed that the reportsof the Bazaar had traveled far and that visitors from many communities would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , potholders , clothespin-bags , handkerchief-cases , table-mats , and painted wooden bowls . Or perhaps it was because the ladies who had charge of preparing the chicken supper had to be here this early and the rest of the Auxiliary membership feltp239that they must not be outdone in diligence . At any rate , the Bazaar opened its doors at one , although the crowd would not come until four or five . They called it the crowd and spoke as if a cordon of the State constabulary would have to be thrown around the building . It was not merely their natural vanity that made them speak so but also the prospect of serving fifty or sixty chicken dinners , which indeed would make crowd enough for any Ladies ' Auxiliary . Laskell saw the children running in and out of the vestry-room doors of the church and went in . Many of the children were dressed in their good clothes and they gathered in corners to slide on the hardwood floor and to punch each other quietly . A few stayed close to their mothers , deriving status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one end of the hall there were seven or eight deal tables which , as Laskell later learned , were always referred to as booths . Emily Caldwell sat at one of them , her own wooden bowls before her , four small and two large . In addition to the bowls she was in charge of other merchandise , two heavily embroidered guest-towels and a small pillow of blue silk . At Emily 's left sat a faded blond young woman whom Emily called Glenda and introduced as Mrs. Parks . The chief articles that Mrs. Parks had before her were small doilies tatted in intricate patterns . Laskell suddenly realized that he was on the point of becoming the possessor of one of Emily Caldwell 's bowls . " You 've made six . I thought you were only going to make four , " he said , and observed that Mrs. Parks withdrew some of the brightnessof her smile at this indication that he had been party to Emily'screative plans . " Yes , " said Emily . She said it remotely . She assumed a look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that if he did show a knowledge of her plans , it was beyond her how he came by it and she did not admit it into notice . It was not a very clever maneuver against the quick eye of Glenda Parks . Then she smiled at him rather wanly and said , " I did n't think I 'd have time for so many , but I did . " She was shy . And Laskell was shy as he said , " I 'd like to buy one , if I may . "  | " Well , of course  --  if you  --  " What if she was going to propose , she did not go on to say . There could be no reasonable condition . But no doubt she wanted to tell him that he must not feel , merely because of what had been between them , whatever that was , that he was obliged to buy . The artist did not wish to be mistaken for the woman , but the woman was looking at him with uncertain eyes as he picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study the design of each . He studied the four small and two large bowls , their designs in high red and blue , red for curves and rounds , blue for angles and sharpnesses . " Very original , I call them , " said Mrs. Parks . Loyalty to the Bazaar , and dissent from Emily , and then again some ambiguous sense of solidarity with another woman were mixed in her voice . " Very unusual . " Still holding a bowl out at half an arm 's length , Laskell nodded gravely to Mrs. Parks . " Yes , they certainly are , " he said . Ile spoke in the neutral , unemphatic voice of the buyer of a work of art who so truly respects the object that he must speak of it without surprise , for it is a natural and inevitable phenomenon that has always existed in the nature of things . " So modernistic , " said Mrs. Parks , secure in the established traditionof her tatting patterns . " Yes , is n't it ? " said Laskell , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the unprincipled designs of these bowls he did not know . He could see the forms of Cubism as it had been picked up from the brushes of Parisians who had dropped it two decades before , picked up by men of small intellect and less passion . Ile could see in the angles the embodied talk about the machine age and the beauty of the functional which had always implied angles . There was arts-and-crafts and a touch of the folk and even of the peasant , the saving myth of hand work . There was the deep sullen modern mysticism of the abstract and nonrepresentational , here scarcely understood . Oh , it was so thoroughlynot good , it was so bad and silly and derivative and yet somehow it contained so much that , though badly transmitted and ill understood , had been tried and fought for in confusion and pain and pride that it went to his heart through all the firm barriers of judgment and taste . Each of the designs was in bad taste andp241each , with its red and blue and its unorganized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely because it denied the sunny fleshly quality of the meeting by the river . Was she at all what these darkened unhappy designs implied  --  as well as the woman who at first sight had suggested an ancient goddess to him , as well as the woman who had been foolish and social and pretentiousat the Grooms ' , and as well as the woman on the river bank ? And as well as the rather ordinary-seeming woman who sat here next to Mrs. Parks and not without something of Mrs. Parks ' pinched , wan quality ? Emily seemed troubled and uneasy , as if frightened that he might say or do something that would betray their relationship . " I think I like this one best , " he said at last . He added , " Though it 's hard to choose . " He tacked on the addition because he remembered the shadow he had seen pass over the faces of artists when you select one picture from all that have been shown , for by making a choice you are rejecting all the rest . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , " said Emily Caldwell . She was blushing . " I  --  I decided that was what they were really worth . " As Laskell gave her the two dollar bills , Mrs. Folger came up in her large competent apron . " I guess you 've Made the first sale , Emily . Do n't you think Emily 's bowls are very unusual ? I call them quite original . Do you think so too , Mr. Laskell ? That 's Mrs. Caldwell 's strong point , I always say  --  originality . Is n't that so , Glenda ? " " Oh , yes , originality . " Mrs. Folger had a strong tie with him and it was not quite easy for him to say with all the necessary crispness , " Yes  --  they are extremelytalented . " But he said it crisply enough and the two women at once accepted this check of their subtle intention of making Emily Caldwell the object of their descriptive minds . The bowl having been paid for , Laskell said , " Will it be all right if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think your whole collection should be seen together . But be sure not to forget which is mine . Here  --  " and he took up a pencil and pad that were lying on the table , perhaps for purposes of accounts , and wrote " Sold " on it . He laid the slip in the big bowl.  | Susan came over to them carrying in her arms her big book . " Will you hear my poem once more , Mother ? " she said . Mrs. Parks smiled at the child and Mrs. Folger put her hand on her head and Laskell had the sense of how much danger Emily and Susan habituallylived in . " Is it for the entertainment , Susan ? " said Mrs. Folger kindly . " The children , " she explained to Laskell , " are giving a few renditionsafter supper . " " Yes , it 's for the entertainment , " Susan said . " Do you want to hear me , Mother ? " " Later , dear , " said Emily . It was obvious to Laskell that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain lack of innocence in her face which he could interpret . It reached him at once and it moved and flattered him greatly . He said , " I 'll hear your poem , Susan . Come into the corner where we wo n't disturb anyone . " He felt in Mrs. Parks and Mrs. Folger the quick rising of curiosity . He led Susan to an unoccupied corner and opened the book and heard the poem . Her interpretation was much as it had been when he had first experienced it . If it had changed in any way it was to a greater elaboration of gesture . When she came to the final declaration , " I will not cease from mental strife , " she emphasized the not and she stamped her foot in that petulant insistence which he had told her was wrong . She looked at him stricken and abashed . She was about to begin the whole poem from the beginning when Laskellsaid , " Look , Susan , it 's not important that you do it the way 1 suggested . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 're used to it . " For the whole method of recitation was so touchingly absurd , with its reaching and grasping of the objects mentioned in the poem , its extravagant descriptive gestures , that there was no point in putting the child under strain for this one small matter of emphasis . But now she set as much store by it as by anything else in her delivery . " If it 's right , it 's right , " she said , " and I must get it right . " And stubbornly she went over and over the verse until she got it right.  |p243When  at last she felt secure of its impress on her memory , she said comfortably to Laskell , " Now will you take me up to the trailer ? " She had not in the least forgotten her invitation to tea and there was nothing for Laskell to do , since he had issued the invitation , except to offer to escort her . He had forgotten it , but Kermit , it turned out , had not . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chocolate Malomar biscuits , rightly guessing that any child would know that hospitality was represented by free license to destroy as many of these marshmallow mosques as she chose . Susan sat and drank cambric tea with the three men , having first made the tea . She called it , as Kermit did , cambric tea , and it made Laskell think of the strange confusion of the child 's background , for no one any longer spoke of cambric tea except from the memory of a very sheltered and genteel childhood . She protested the cambric quality of the tea on which the men insisted . She herself poured for them , doing it very well , and she would have given herselfan adult cup if they had not all commanded , with a superstitiousfear of what undiluted tea would do to a child 's nervous system , that she add the large quantity of milk . She was much interestedby the arrangement of the trailer and had worked all the gadgets , but she was even more interested in her two hosts . She naturally inquired about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson was an editor and Gifford Maxim a writer . She devoured more chocolate Mallomars than it seemed likely she could hold and beamed at the men . At five o'clock the crowd back at the church was at its thickest . At six the chicken dinner was served . At six-thirty Mrs. Parks sighed and said , " Those Romans ! " It quite startled Laskell , who sat across the table from her . Maxim and Kermit , Nancy and Arthur , had all arrived in time for the supper too . But Laskell , alone of them , was listening to Mrs. Parks . He looked at her expectantly , waiting for her to complete or explain her remark . But Mrs. Parks wanted a larger audience . " Those Romans , " she said again , " they certainly had the right idea . " She lolled her head about in a gentle , abandoned , stupefied way . From the lolling of her head Laskell understood that she re/ferred to the Roman conduct of a banquet . But he could not tell which of two possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet corn and of chicken stewed with dumplings had been eaten and removed . The great cakes had been demolished . The pitchers of milk and the pots of coffee were emptied . They had all eaten a great deal and Mrs. Parks may have wanted to say that she was so exhausted from eating that she understood the Roman habit of banqueting on couches , or she may have meant that she was so stuffed that she understood the Roman use of the vomitorium . No one was giving her the opportunity to develop her erudition and so she said in a louder voice with a faded blond insistence , " You certainly have to hand it to the Romans  --  they had the right idea . " On this attempt she got the audience she wanted . She had addressedher remark to the Croom party in general . Nancy smiled vaguely but responsively . Kermit suspended a conversation he was having with Emily Caldwell over the head of Susan , who sat between them . Kermit smiled to Mrs. Parks and Arthur smiled and Laskell smiled . Maxim looked rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in what he was saying to Mr. Gurney , the minister , who sat at the head of the table . It was Mr. Gurney who took up the remark and gave it the responsethat was wanted . He was closer than the others to Quo Vadis ? , the great rural source of ancient history . " I know just how you feel , " he said , and patted the stomach which he distended for the purpose . " I know just how you feel , " he said again after two or three demonstrative pats which bridged the ages and , for a genial moment , made Mr. Gurney a Roman banqueter . And Mr. Gurney was no doubt very glad to have Mrs. Parks to respond to , for Gifford Maxim had just said to him , " In short , you do not believe in God . " Maxim had not said it in an approving way , nor in a scolding way either , but quite neutrally . He had simply come to a conclusionafter the facts were in . The minister was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in manner both scholarly and rustic . His profession had left its mark on him , for he had a practiced expres/sion of benevolence and tolerance which gave him a look of venality . He was surely not a venal man , anything but a hypocrite , but simply one of those people who make conscious to themselves an aspect of their characters of which they approve and which they try to act out . Mr. Gurney was really benevolent and tolerant but he had made the mistake of trying to appear so . At least it was a mistake from the point of view of the people from New York , none of whom was favorably impressed by Mr. Gurney . And Mr. Gurneyhad some perception of this and was doing his best to put himself right with these notable visitors . He quite naturally wanted to be at one with these people of the modern world . They were people of words and books and advanced ideas . Mrs. Folger , who was in charge of the seating arrangements , had put him at the head of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Emily to the group  --  he felt under a clear obligation to Emily , for he had bought three of her painted wooden bowls , one for himself , one for Nancy and Arthur , and one for Maxim , and when Kermit bought from an artist he was always very careful to establish a friendly relationship which would make it impossible for the artist to feel patronized . Mrs. Folger had then brought Glenda Parks to the table , and Glenda had just confirmed Mrs. Folger 's estimate of her intellectual right to be there by the remark in praise of the Romans . The other five people at the table were all simpler folk who had taken their places when Mr. Gurney , seeing them looking for seats , had called them over and waved them genially into the distinguished company . Mr. Gurney had hoped that these intelligent city people would understand him in his true character  --  that is , as an ordinary man but a good one , who had the welfare of his flock at heart . In speaking to them he had not used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he emphasized its social and material aspects . Nowadays , he knew , advanced people identified the good with social effort , and it was a great relief to Mr. Gurney to know this . He began by asking Nancy , who sat on his right , if she had done much canning this summer . He had then boasted that he himself had canned thirty jars of tomatoes . Nancy had responded most cordially to this . She said , " Imagine ! Thirty jars ! " Then Mr. Gurney talked to Arthurabout farm legislation . He spoke with a comfortable unhappi/ness about the reactionary element in the country districts . He said that the ministers of his church were considerably more liberal than the lay membership . Encouraged by Arthur 's interest , he said that he was not an extremist , but that he was sympathetic to what he called The Great Experiment that was going on over One-Sixth of the Earth 's Surface . " The Research Magnificent , I call it , " he said , turning to Maxim on his left . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Maxim nodded economically , Mr. Gurney went on to say that in some ways religion could be said to be an effort for social justice . He said that it was significant that Jesus Christ had been a carpenter and his apostles of a similarly proletarian origin . " I looked up that word , " he said . He was an honest man and he did not pretend to a classical education he did not have . " I looked it up once and it comes from a Latin word , proles , which means children . Suffer little children to come unto me ! " He looked significantlyat his listeners and nodded the point home conclusively . Everything about Mr. Gurney was clear  --  that he was not learned , that he was not intelligent , that he was decent . Equally clear was his desire to be approved of . All this did not make him very attractive , but Arthur and Nancy listened seriously and nodded in agreement . But the large , strange , and rather forbidding Maxim was listening even more seriously and quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not believe in God . " It was at this appropriate moment that Mr. Gurney heard Mrs. Parks ' statement about the good sense of the ancient Romans . But even after Mr. Gurney had expressed agreement with Mrs. Parks by patting his stomach , Maxim went on with his conclusion . " In short , sir , " he said respectfully but sternly , " in short , you believe in society and social justice and sociology , but you do not believe in God . " Mr. Gurney was taken aback . But he recovered himself . He leaned attentively toward Maxim and smiled . " I 'm sorry , " he said quite urbanely , " I did n't catch the name . " " God , " said Maxim with brutal simplicity . The minister first smiled in embarrassment but then he said with sufficient dignity , " Your name , I mean . " " It 's Maxim , " said Maxim. 1p247Now Mr. Gurney was wholly confused . " I beg your pardon , " he said , " I 'm afraid I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My name  --  my name is Maxim , Gifford Maxim . " He said it with the real intention of being clear . " I 'm sorry if I may have sounded offensive . I did n't mean to . " " No offense where none is taken , " said Mr. Gurney . He then turned to the question . It must have been very confusing for him , for it had long been part of his view of the world that intelligent people were sure to be atheistic or agnostic and , if they spoke about God at all , were likely to attack even " so complicated and modified a belief as Mr. Gurney himself held . This was Mr. Gurney'sfirst encounter with an intelligent man who seemed to blame him for not believing in God . " It depends , " Mr. Gurney said , " on what you mean by God , Mr. Maxim . If you mean a Being who may be understood as some divine purpose in the world , or some principle that is at bottom good  --  " " Suppose we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renderedthat are not rendered to Caesar . " The minister looked terribly guilty , as if he had just been caught rendering something to Caesar that he should have turned over to another party , the legal owner . He no doubt looked the guiltier because he was so very poor and because he had long prided himself on the self-denial of his life . But then he said jovially , " A very good definition , Mr. Maxim . I 'm very glad we agree . " " Do we agree ? " said Maxim . Laskell was startled by the far-off , stubborn expression that Maxim wore . He wondered if Maxim was really going to draw this poor , tiresome man into a theological argument . He was very glad when just then Mr. Gurney 's attention seemed to be decisively claimed by something at the other end of the hall ; the minister laid a hand in a confiding and friendly way on Maxim 's arm . " I 'd like to go on with our discussion some time . I 'm sure I would have much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Mr. Folger had entered , following in the train of a lady who could be no other than Miss Walker . It was Mr. Folger 's attitude that gave Miss Walker her consequence and almost her appearance , for she was only a little package of an elderly maiden lady , dowdy and graceless , but Mr. Folger 's large , grave , authoritative air as he walked by her side gave her the right to be whatever she chose . Mr. Folger walked silently , a quarter-step behind her , his large face holding its irony in reserve . He looked like a minister of state in an illustration by Thackeray . He actually carried nothing , but he had the appearance of a man with a portfolio . Mr. Gurney and Mrs. Folger converged upon the entering pair and so did the gaze of all the replete diners at all the five trestletables . But then , with a unanimity of quiet politeness , all eyes were turned back to the coffee cups . Miss Walker was led to a corner and comfortably bestowed there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She has the big place down the road . She takes a lot of interest  --  in the church , I mean . She had it all renovated two years ago , and painted . " They all gazed at Miss Walker sitting in her state , and Kermit got up from his chair to look . " Why , it is Aunt Julia , of course it is . I must go over and say hello . " And he started off and then came back . " All of you come , I 'd like you to meet her . " Nancy said , " Not now , Kermit . Some other time . " " No , come now . You 'll like her , everyone likes Aunt Julia . " " Mother ! " said Susan in excitement . " Mother ! " Emily 's " Yes , dear " was intended not to encourage Susan to ask the question she was bursting with but to signal that she could consider the question both asked and answered . But Susan was not being sensitive to signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Simpson called Cousin Julia Walker Aunt Julia . " " Yes , dear . " But Kermit with his quick attention said to Susan , really addressinghis question to Emily , " Are you and Miss Walker cousins ? She 's not my aunt , Susan , I just call her that . " Then it suddenly struck him and he said , " Then you must be cousins of Theron Walker . " Emily said , " We 're only distantly related to Miss Walker . Very distant . " But to Kermit the interesting thing was that they were related to Theron , just as it was the interesting thing about Miss Walker . It was interesting because Theron Walker was a poet . He said , " But then you must be related to Theron Walker , her nephew ? "   " I do n't know him , " Emily said . " I suppose if Miss Walker 's his aunt we 're related . But I do n't know him . " " The poet , " Kermit explained . " One of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A family was a family to Kermit and he could not believe , since some relationship existed between Theron and Emily through Miss Walker , that Emily did not know of it . And a family was a family to Susan , especially , perhaps , if it could give her kinship with a poet . She shook her mother 's arm to jog her memory . " Do n't you remember him from when you were a little girl ? " " No , " said Emily . She said to Kermit , " I only knew one nephew of Miss Walker 's . His name was Ralph . He was a little boy when I knew him , about thirteen . " " That 's Theron ! " Kermit cried in triumph . " Ralph Theron Walker . He hated the name Ralph and dropped it . " " Oh , " said Emily . She allowed the memory to come . " Ralph ? And he became a poet ? You see , I 'm not in touch with the family . Miss Walker and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How is Ralph ? " " You do n't know ? " Kermit said . " He 's dead . He died in Spain . " " In Spain ? Fighting ? " " Well , he went to fight . But he stepped on a nail and died of lockjaw . " A shadow passed over Susan 's face at this quick loss of a new poet cousin . She stood beside her mother for her mother 's arm to encircle her . And now Kermit was in one of his quandaries . For he wanted to renew his old acquaintance with Aunt Julia . But he did not like to seem to take sides in what must be a family breach by abandoningthe Caldwells for Miss Walker . " Your cousin wrote poems about Miss Walker , " Kermit said to Susan . " One of them was called The Pulia of My Aunt Joodle . " " What ? " said Susan in a spurt of laughter . " Oh , that 's crazy . " " Yes , that 's the name of it . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted the names around and called your cousin Joodle and the dog a pulia , to suggest how much they meant to each . other . "   " Joodle ! " said Susan with great pleasure as her cousin ceased to be a dead man . " Pulia ! " " You saw that dog , Susan , when you were very little , " Emily said . " Do you remember ? A big black dog . He 's dead now . " Susan tried hard but she could not remember . " You played with him and he licked your face . You laughed . " Susan was struggling with the idea that a dog in a poem was an actual dog who had licked her face . Having made so lively a figure of the poet for her , Kermit now felt it was all right to leave . " If you 'll excuse me for a moment ? " he asked gravely . But only Maxim went with him , for Nancy still felt her grievanceagainst Miss Walker , and Arthur stayed with Nancy . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by turning to talk to Emily . " It 's warm here , " Laskell said . " Would you like to go outside ? " The supper was over . They were all rising from the table . She shook her head as if he ought to know better than to ask . " But we could sit near the door , " she said . They went and sat near the rear door . The evening was beginning to come on . " Did it trouble you  --  all that talk about your family ? " He knew something of the quarrel with Miss Walker which had followed the affair with Duck and the marriage . " No , " she said , " not really . Except to think of Ralph being dead . I did n't really like him as a boy . He did n't like me . He spent the vacation with Julia Walker the summer I was her companion . You know how boys are , that was the summer I met my husband . He knew what was going on . They hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb out of my window late at night and Ralph knew it and he used to stay up and make a noise like an owl out of the window . But I suppose he changed . He must have changed to become a poet . " The tables were now all empty and were being pushed to one end of the hall while a group of men and boys set up the wooden folding chairs , ranging them in rows to face the little platform . Susan came up to them . " Mother ! " she said , " it 's going to start right away . I have to get ready . " " Yes , dear . What 's there to get ready ? " " I mean  --  it 's starting soon  --  " and Susan pointed to the group ofP251five or six children who were being collected by Mr. Gurney . She was full of impatience , any child 's impatience to join the group she belongs to . But she needed some encouragement to do what she wanted . " Go ahead , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Susan said . And she turned to Laskell and said with conspiratorial assurance , " I wo n't forget . " " Good  --  do n't , " he said . And for the first time he really saw that there was a gap where one of Susan 's teeth had not yet come in . The space had always been there , ever since he had known Susan , but he had somehow never seen it before , this always funny mark of a child 's childishness and growth . He reached out and laid his hand on her cheek , and to his surprise she nestled the cheek into his palm , tilting her head to do so , and then she was gone in a bustle of importance . " She 's sweet , " Laskell said . " What is it she wo n't forget ? " " Oh , just a suggestion about how to say it . " His answer was brusque because he was suddenly aware that in some strange fashionhe had taken a responsibility for the child . And perhaps that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If he can . " She spoke as if Duck were detained by many duties which he would hasten through to come to see his daughter perform . But then she said , " He probably ca n't . " Laskell knew that Kermit 's whisky was to be held accountable . The evening was cool and the sunlight that fell on the grass within their view had a liquid quality , as if it were not only lightingthe grass but moistening it as well . Emily sat quiet , looking worn and tired . He thought that perhaps the sudden reminder of her past had wearied her , her recollection of herself as a young woman climbing out of her bedroom window to meet her lover while Theron Walker hooted like an owl . Perhaps she was oppressedby the realization that enough years had passed to change that hooting boy to a man and a poet , to someone old enough to make the decision to go to Spain , and old enough to die there . Laskellhad nothing to say to her . He knew her so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling . So they sat there , dull and commonplace with each other , and yet snatching together a mo-P252ment of rest  --  she from her life of troubles , he from his life of uncertainty . Suddenly she caught his arm . Duck was entering the hall through the other door and stood surveying the company , most of whom had found seats in the rows of folding chairs . He was dressed in a fresh white shirt . He had taken pains to prepare for the occasion , for he had shaved , and down his cheek ran a rivulet of blood where he had cut himself . It must have been quite a gash , for the blood was thick and had already dripped to stain the collar of the white shirt . Duck looked about him with elaborate dignity and chose an end seat in the second row of chairs . He walked steadily but carefully , and when he sat down he sat heavily and with a noise . When once Emily had clutched Laskell 's arm , she did nothing more , and she released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not go to sit with her husband , although there was a vacant place on his right . When it was time for them to come forward for the performance , she sat with Laskell as far back as possible , in the last row , and this was a measure of her alienation from her husband , for it was an action that would surely be marked by her neighbors . At last everyone was seated and the performance might begin . Why it did not begin was a question that could be answered only through an understanding of the particular spirit which presides over amateur performances , a spirit with laws peculiar to itself , though not unlike the laws which govern the behavior of the spiritsthat preside over nations or bureaucracies . The audience was ready , the performers were huddled together in a daze , the ministerwalked about with apparently nothing else to do except begin , but until the spirit should be properly appeased by a full offering of whispered conferences among certain members of the committeein charge , by coughs and by shufflings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began . The first number on the program , Mr. Gurney announced , was to be Columba Parks ' piano rendition of " Parade of the Wooden Soldiers . " Mr. Gurney had explained that the program was to be a short one and an individual one . By that , he said , he meant that it was not to be cooperative , like a pageant or a play .   " Cooperative ! " said Emily Caldwell with a mild , maternal bitterness . " With all the other children getting the best parts and Susan always a maiden or a lady-in-waiting . " It was very small-minded of her , but Laskell nodded in sympathy . Mr. Gurney went on to say that each of the children was going to make an offering of whatever he  --  or she  --  most wanted to do . If , therefore , he said , the effort was not cooperative , it was at least spontaneous . Why Mr. Gurney used language like this could be understood when he mentioned that the congregation was fortunateto have several guests whom he ventured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled at the row of chairs which contained Arthur , Nancy , Kermit , and Maxim . And then he welcomed Miss Walker by name and said she was known to everyone here . Columba Parks was much like her mother , appearing to have begun life at the point which her mother had reached after some years , or perhaps to have faded before she had bloomed . When she had finished her rendition of " The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers " and had been applauded in a very friendly way , she gave as an encore " The Waltz of the Roses . " " Susan was not told to have an encore , " said Emily . Laskell felt the injustice of this . " Our next little performer , " said Mr. Gurney , " and I should explain that our program is arranged in order of the performers ' age  --  our next little performer will be Susan Caldwell . " Susan rose from her seat in the front row and walked with a high head up onto the platform . Laskell felt very apprehensive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was heard the loud measured clapping of a single pair of hands . They were Duck Caldwell 's and he held them up to show . " Susan is going to oblige us with the recitation of a little poem , a very beautiful little poem I 'm sure you 'll find it , by the eccentric English poet , William Blake . Susan ! " And Mr. Gurney pointed a sudden finger at Susan as he said her name in a quick bark , much in the way a referee galvanizes into existence a prizefighter in his corner . Laskell dreaded that Susan would make a curtsy , but she simply bowed graciously to the minister and was no doubt about to bowp254in a similar way to the audience when Mr. Gurney put his arm around her shoulder and announced , " Susan Caldwell : a poem by William Blake . " The minister returned to the back of the stage and sat down . There was applause and again the sound of Duck 's hollow palms beaten together three times . Susan glanced quickly at her father , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her audience . She took her position of naturalness , and Laskell had to admit that it was natural enough . Her eyes sought the very back of the hall . " ' And did those feet in ancient timeWalk upon England 's mountains green ? And was the holy Lamb of GodOn England 's pleasant pastures seen ? ' " Her voice was clear and distinct and the missing tooth scarcely lessenedits tranced solemnity . Laskell , glancing at Emily , saw her tense pleasure as the child was launched , saw the diminishing anxietyas Susan 's down-swung hand indicated the feet , the highswungarm indicated the mountains green , the cradling arms indicated the Lamb of God , the suppling wrist and arm pointed to the pleasantness and extent of the pastures . Susan went on : " ' And did the Countenance DivineShine forth upon our clouded hills ? And was Jerusalem builded hereAmong these dark Satanic Mills ? ' " And now Laskell could feel Emily 's lessening worry and then her relaxed pleasure as Susan began the third stanza with all its objects to be snatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt himself hardening against any judgment his friends might be makingupon this method of reciting . He felt very stern toward Nancy if Nancy should be feeling that there was any vulgarity in it . He looked for the back of Nancy 's head to see if it showed suppressed laughter . But if he was prepared to be angry with Nancy if Nancy should laugh , he was also prepared to be angry at Emily for that part of her foolish pride in Susan 's performance that went beyond proper maternal feeling . P255Susan plucked boldly from the air her spear of burning gold and her arrows of desire . She expressed a certain gratified surprise that they should be brought so quickly upon her demand . She accepted her sword and commanded the clouds to unfold . Then having receivedthe reins of the chariot of fire , she tossed them aside and was going on . She took one step forward , as if to indicate that the mood or key was to change . " I will not cease from Mental Fight ' "  --  She had stamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not make any of the gesturespeople make to show that they are conscious of having committedan error . Her frightened eyes moved once to the side and she began again . " I will not cease from Mental Fight ' "  --  She said it as she had undertaken to . But she stopped and was unable to go on . Why had he interfered ? Never in his life had Laskcll made so foolish and desperate a mistake . He heard Emily 's tight breath beside him and then her anguished desperate " Oh ! " The child stood immobile , unableeven to struggle against the confinement of her lapsed memory . " Nor ' ! " said Laskell in a loud neutral voice . " Nor shall my Sword ' " Every head was turned to look at him . But he was aware only of Susan starting into motion again . " Nor shall my Sword sleep in my hand Till we have built JerusalemIn England 's green and pleasant land . " And she dedicated the sword to sleeplessness , she built Jerusalem with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenness and pleasantness of the land . Then she bowed and there was loud applause  --  not , of course , for her art , and certainly not for what she had predicted about Jerusalem and England , but for the misfortune she had suffered and sustained . There were advantages in lack of sensibility , for Mr. Gurney came forward and put his arm around her and hugged her to him and said , " Thank you , Susan Caldwell , " just as if it were the radio . " Thank you , Susan Caldwell , " he said again . " That was very , very beautiful . " And he whispered something in her ear , dragging her off balance and thus making her a child entirely . And she was no doubt glad to be a child and not a performer , for she smiled . She walked off the stage , down the steps , and then stopped as she saw that she was being met by her father . Emily clutched Laskell 's arm . Susan did not advance and neither did Duck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , God , " said Emily . Duck laid his head slowly on one side and regarded his daughterfrom the angle . " A fine one , " he said slowly . " A fine one you are . A disgrace . " Susan only looked at him , neither advancing nor retreating . He had only to take two steps forward to reach her with his hand . The first blow , on the left cheek , was with the palm . The second , on the right cheek , was with the back of the hand . Mr. Gurney 's agonized cry of " Stop ! " in an almost feminine voice came at the same time as Emily Caldwell 's shriek , and when the audience recovered from the shock of these two sounds from opposite ends of the little hall , it saw that the child had fallen and it made a great rattling of chairs . It was Kermit Simpson who picked her up in his arms and laid her on the edge of the platform , while Gifford Maxim and Arthur Croom and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd and stretched out their arms and said what on such occasions is always said , " Stand back . Give her air . " Emily Caldwell had made her way forward and stood with Kermit over the child . She stood so a moment and then uttered a horrible cry , lost to all consciousness and almost to all humanity , an animal 's cry , not able to call forth sympathy from anyone who heard it but only dread and repulsion . The cry so separated the woman from everyone else , and so denied and insulted them all by its animal isolation , that someone had to interpret it . " She 's dead . He killed her , " someone announced . Laskell , on the edge of the crowd , saw a figure pushing its way back against the pressure . It was Duck Caldwell , and he stood for a moment as if recovering his breath after escaping a danger . Then he ran , making for the farther door , running with his shoulders forward . He vanished through the door . Laskell ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it in his hand , was not much of a knife . It was only the sort of pocket-knife that any man might carry . A man who worked as a carpenter would use such a knife for scoring a plank before sawing it , or for splitting a bit of soft wood . The handle was scarcely big enough to span the palm . The blade that had been opened , although the largest of the three , was not long , not longer than the width of three or four fingers , and not at all sharp . It was the kind of blade that is rounded at the end , not pointed . It could not have stabbed easily , scarcely at all , and if Duck had intended to cut anyone 's throat with it , he would have had to apply himself long and earnestly to the job . The blade was stained and dark , anything but gleaming , and the only thing that told Laskell that Duck had a knife in his hand was the soft little round-and-round movement that Duck made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duck said , " Keep away . I got a knife . " It was not yet fully dark as Laskell ran out of the church . But it was nearly dark . Laskell looked around him but Duck was not to be seen . Behind him , in the church , he heard the beehive noise of sixty or seventy people getting a fact into their heads . It made the outdoors seem very still . And it was the stiller because of the unseenpresence of Duck . For Duck must be hiding somewhere . " Duck ! " Laskell called . It was the first time he had ever addressedthe man by name , that slightly ignoble nickname . " Duck ! " he called again , very urgently . At any moment the loud murmur in the church would cease and the people would be coming out . There was no answer . " Duck ! " he called again . " Come out ! Where are you ? " Suddenly a clump of bushes by the side of the road stirred andP258rustled and then Duck stood out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear in the twilight ; at that distance Laskell could not see the stain of blood on it . Duck said nothing , just looked and lowered . His body swayed slightly . He was still drunk . Laskell started to run toward him . His heart was pounding with the high excitement of what he was about to do . " I want to talk to you , " he called as he ran . Duck stood in the middle of the road . " Keep away , " he said . He held up his left hand with the palm forward , like a traffic policeman . " Just keep away from me , " he said with the supreme reliance on reasonableness that drunken men have . " I want to talk to you , " Laskell said . Duck had lowered his hand but now he raised it again in the same way , palm thrust forward . He seemed to feel that there was great meaning and authority in that way of holding up his hand . " Just keep away from me , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were offering a compromise . " Just do n't come near me , " he said . And then he began making that soft circling movement with his right hand . But as Laskell continued to approach , he said , " I got a knife . Keep away  --  I got a knife . " Laskell had in any case slowed down to a walk . " Listen , Duck , " he said . " Do n't be a fool . I want to talk to you . " " I 'm warning you , " said Duck . " I 'm telling you . Just keep away from me . " What Laskell had to say to Duck could not be shouted . He continued to approach . He thought , and with a gleam of pride in his practicality , that once Duck knew what he was about to be told , there would not be even the appearance of danger that there was now . But he kept his eye on the gentle , continuous , circular movementthat Duck was making with his right hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He was exasperated with the man 's stubbornness and lack of comprehension . He shouted once , " Duck ! " but his breath was coming hard and he made up his mind to call no more . He was not gainingon Duck but he was not losing ground . Neither of them could run very well on the rough , stone-strewed road . Then Duck stopped dead and turned and faced Laskell . When Laskell slowedP259down and again began to walk forward , he was nearer the man than before the absurd chase began . Laskell said , " It 's not what you think . She 's dead , but it was n't you who killed her . " It was not a very enlightening way to put it . It was like telling a riddle to a man in great danger . And Duck , his mind made up and very clear about what had happened , naturally did not hear the phrase that exempted him from guilt . Laskell tried again , " She had a weak heart , " he said . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed ridiculous to run after a man who had killed his daughter to tell him that she had a weak heart . And if Duck heard the statement at all , it seemed to enrage him . " God damn you ! " Duck shouted in a sudden fury . His voice cracked with the fierceness of his rage . " I told you to keep away from me . Do n't you God damn touch me ! " " Will you listen to me ? " Laskell shouted . He was suddenly in a rage too . It swept over him , the desire to blast and blight this man who would not accept the salvation that was being offered him . And because he took another step forward , Duck rushed . Laskell must have known in some way that Duck 's threat was real , for he did not take more than the one step , and he was not wholly unprepared for the rush . And there was something inconclusiveabout the way Duck tried to use the knife , something merely demonstrative , as if , together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of showing just how he would go about stabbing . Laskell was able to catch the wrist before the blow struck . The wrist was as strong as iron and its pressure downward was very great  --  greater , Laskell knew , than he could sustain for long . Suddenly Duck tried to pull his wrist free to strike again , but Laskell held on , and out of his boyhood he remembered to slip his thumb up to the tender hollow where Duck 's thumb-tendon met the wrist . He remembered the excruciating pain that could be inflicted by pressure here and the legend that boys solemnly impartedto each other that " no one could stand that pain long " but . was bound , upon its continuation , to drop his weapon . In spite of the impressive certainty of this statement , Duck 's wrist was againP260pressing forward and down . Yet Laskell must have been inflicting some pain , for Duck began first to beat at his face with his left hand and then , changing tactics , to pound his biceps . This was perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Laskell was intense and he knew that he could not stand it long . He fought to catch Duck 's left wrist and caught it . Then what he had learned in his boyhood turned out to be true , for suddenly Duck 's hand actually opened and the knife dropped from it . But at that very moment Laskell felt Duck 's balance shift and he knew that a kick was in the making and where it would be aimed and he leaped to the side , still holding the wrist . His impulse of self-protectionmust have been very strong indeed and very sudden , and Duck 's rage and self-forgetfulness must also have been great , for Duck was lying on his side in the road . The hand on Laskell 's shoulder was Maxim 's . Maxim said , " All right , John . Let him alone now . " There were six or seven other men and they stood around in embarrassment . Duck lay on the road , not moving . " Is he all right ? " said one of the men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He let go of it . Duck 's eyes were open , but he lay perfectly still . Laskell was revoltedby the sight of Duck lying there with his eyes open , and he was revolted by himself for having brought Duck to this low state . It seemed to him that there never had been anything uglier than the picture of himself and Duck as they had been through their fight and were now . They all stood there looking in embarrassmentat the man lying in the dust of the road . He lay there , not moving , looking up at them . He expressed his hatred and rage in that way . Then he got up . He rose very slowly to his feet . He brushed himself off elaborately . When he had done this in his own good time , he said , " All right . Let 's go . " The men did not quite know what to do about it . They had chased after Duck to take him , but now that they had him , they did not know what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by starting off up the road and they regrouped themselvesaround him loosely , so as not to make too much of a point of his being a captured man . Still , they walked close to him . P261Laskell watched them go . His message was still undelivered and he had to shake off the effect of Duck lying there in the road with his eyes open , letting his supine state sink into the consciousness of the people who stood around him , letting it be a kind of insult to them . He started after them suddenly and then he felt Maxim 's hand on his arm . " Hold it ! " said Maxim , but Laskell shook him off impatiently . He called , " Wait a minute , " and ran to catch up with them . They all stopped in the road and turned to see what he wanted and he said , " Listen , Duck  --  " Duck turned very slowly and contemptuously . He looked at Laskell with a blank face and then spat at him shortly , once . The spittle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach , but there was such a fullness of hatred in the act that Laskell stopped dead not only in his tracks but in his being . For whether or not Duck knew it , Laskell knew that Duck had reason to hate him . The group started on its way up the road . Laskell stood still and watched them go . Maxim said , " Are you all right , John ? " It was what he had said , Laskell remembered , that day when he had come on his visit and had seen Laskell attended by Paine . He still had his old practiced solicitude for suffering . " I 'm all right , " Laskell said . Maxim put his head close in the very dim light and looked at Laskell 's face . " Your lip is cut , " he said . Laskell became aware of his swollen mouth . Licking his lip , he tasted the saltiness of blood . " Come down to the trailer and I 'll put something on it . You need a drink . " Without answering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The trailer was hot and close , for the day had been very hot and had not yet cooled off , but Maxim switched on the electric fan and said , " It will be cool in a few minutes . Or would you like to sit outside ? " " No , it 's all right here . " Maxim got out a bottle of whisky and said , " Have you a clean handkerchief ? " Laskell produced a handkerchief . It was clean , but Maxim in- spected it before he poured the whisky on . " Here , " he said , " put this to your lip a minute . It 's as good a disinfectant as anything . " The whisky burned Laskell 's cut lip in a therapeutic way . Maxim made Laskell a stiff drink and one for himself . As Laskell dabbed at his lip with the old strong bourbon that Kermit stocked , he remembered the smell of whisky on Duck 's breath . He took a large swallow of the drink , then finished it . Maxim made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes . Then , as if he had just remembered something , he reached into his pocket and took out the knife . He did not look at it but laid it down in a matter-of-fact way on the settee beside Laskell . " Here 's your knife , " he said . " I picked it up on the road . " He said it very casually , but he was looking at Laskell with a veiled curiosity . " It 's not my knife , " Laskell said . Then he looked sharply at Maxim . " It 's not mine . It 's his . What made you think it was mine ? " It was a sizable error that Maxim had made , and Maxim seemed to think so , for he dropped his eyes and masked his face . Then he looked at Laskell and made a dry , complex gesture with his mouth and eyebrows . He seemed to mean to say , " All right , if you say so . Perhaps I 'm wrong , but perhaps not so wrong as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What made you think it was my knife ? That 's an odd mistake . " Maxim shrugged elaborately . " After all , " he said , quite as if it were an answer . But Laskell was at the end of some patience or other . " ' After all ? ' " he said explosively . " After all what ? What are you trying to say ? " Maxim looked with a kind of gentle forbearance at his friend  --  all through the time since the trailer had arrived he had been acting as if Laskell were his friend and now he looked at Laskell with a friend 's tolerance . He explained most painstakingly . " He ran and you ran after him . You were out of the door before any of us thought to move . You were very fond of the little girl . You loved her . " Whatever Maxim was intending to say was dimmed for Laskell by the sudden appearance of Susan in the past tense . For the first time he understood that the fact was not that Duck had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him suddenly , and it had the effect of a blanket over his mind . " Maybe you love the child 's mother , but you loved the child too . The man ran in guilt and you ran after him in rage . It would n't be surprising that in the heat of the moment you wanted to kill him . So I supposed that the knife was yours . The blade was open . " Having concluded his reasoning , Maxim made a gesture of opening his hands to show how natural it was that he should have come to it . The gesture had also the effect of suggesting that the conclusion was a logical and even a right one . Laskell did not answer . He picked up the knife and opened the largest blade . It was then that he saw how homely and harmless a thing it was , how dull and stained . It had a cheap white plastic handle . He turned it over and saw that on the other side of the handle was a picture of a naked woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife , long-legged , wide-hipped , notable for the size and symmetry of her breasts . Laskell could press his thumb against the dull edge of the large blade without malting anything more than a ridge in his flesh . It looked as anonymously touching as a broken stone knife dug out of some ancient kitchen-midden . He held out his hand with the knife in it so that Maxim could see the picture of the naked woman . Maxim had certainly not seen it or he would not have supposed the knife was Laskell 's . Maxim looked at the picture and with a small movement of his glass signed that he had indeed been in error . Laskell closed the knife and put it away in his pocket . " What are you going to do with it ? " Maxim said . " Do with it ? I do n't know what I 'll do with it . Give it back to him . " Maxim glanced keenly at Laskell as if to read some unexpressed motive in what Laskell had said . He said , " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you run after him ? To capture him for the law , like a good citizen ? " It was hard to tell whether or not there was irony in Maxim 's voice . Laskell said , " No . " " Then why did you run after him ? And what did you want to say to him after they started to take him away ? " Maxim was asking questions as if he still had the right to do soP264because of his commitment to the great cause of the future . He had no commitment and no right . Yet he did not seem to be asking questions idly . There was something he really wanted to find out . There was something he needed to know for some purpose of his own , though Laskell was too weary even to try to guess what that purpose was . With each moment now the fatigue grew greater . Laskell got up and poured himself another drink of whisky . " I 'd just as soon not talk about the whole business , " he said . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unable to say another word . " All right , John , " Maxim said readily . " But let me ask you this  --  you say you did not run after him in a rage , but are you going to give him back the knife now ? I mean , are you going to do it knowinghow much worse it will be for him if it is shown in court that he pulled a knife on you ? " Laskell examined Maxim 's face . It seemed impossible that even a Maxim fallen from glory could imagine the possibility of such an intention . He let his contempt come into his face as he said , " What 's the matter with you , Maxim ? " Maxim paid no attention to the contempt . He said very mildly , " It 's just because you said you were going to give him the knife . It obviously could only get him into worse trouble . " " I meant when they let him go  --  that 's when I would give it to him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him go ? That will be a long time from now . It 's not murder , but he 'll get quite a few years for manslaughter . " " No . They 'll let him go , " said Laskell . " The child had a weak heart . He did n't know that . But that 's why the slaps killed her . They 'll have to find it an accident . I doubt if it will get beyond the coroner . " Those were no slaps , " Maxim said . " Those were blows . I was sitting right there . But they 'll let him go if what you say is so . " And then he added craftily , " He did n't know about the heart ?  --  but you did ? " " Yes , " Laskell said . He knew he was admitting his relation to Emily . He nevertheless said it .   " That 's why you ran after him ? To tell him ? " " All right , Maxim . All right . You win . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusing how skillfully Maxim had drawn the web around him to trap the information he wanted . A beautiful job  --  first the assumption that the knife was Laskell 's , then the suggestion that Laskell intended to add to Duck 's trouble by turning up with it . He was still quite the inquisitor , just as good as he had ever been . But why should he be exercising his inquisitorial skill now ? Was it simply because it was his nature to use it ? No , that was not it . Maxim was asking , " Why did you care , John ? " And dimly Laskellperceived that Maxim was not questioning him gratuitously , that he was after something . Shaking his head as if physically to clear his brain , he addressed himself to the question . " Care ? You mean , why did I care that he should n't run away , that he should n't try to do something foolish ? " Maxim nodded to this formulation of the question . Laskell made no attempt to answer it at once . Why indeed did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . He still had to work it out for himself . He had not given the matter a thought  --  he had simply seen Duck start to run and had known that Duck was running because he thought he had killed the child . He had chased after him to correct the error . But why had his mind been so quick to perceive the error and why had he felt the need to correct it , a need so immediatethat it had made him forget the deep visceral hatred he felt for Duck ? He was not able to come to a conclusion . He was not able really to think about it , but only to " consider " it . Even after he had been silent a while Laskell had nothing more to say than , " He 's not responsible for the child 's death , you see . " He said it simply , as if Maxim were a very simple person . Maxim just sat and waited , not speaking . Laskell frowned . In some vague way he resented Maxim 's pressure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to know what lay behind his " automatic " response of running after Duck . He said , " Maybe I 'm just as responsible as he is. "
