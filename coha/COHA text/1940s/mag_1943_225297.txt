The little-known story of the first U.S. Presidential radio broadcast was told last week in Movie-Radio Guide . <P> President Wilson was aboard the liner George Washington , returning from the Versailles Peace Conference . It had been announced that on the Fourth of July ( 1919 ) he would address the crews of all the convoying ships . The significance of this communication was noted by only a handful of newfangled thinkers - radio men . Most U.S. newspaper editors , buried the news among their gall bladder ads . <P> Engineers John H. Payne and Harold H. Beverage ( now of General Electric and RCA respectively ) rigged up the equipment . President Wilson 's advisers insisted that the microphone be concealed : they were afraid it would make the President nervous . The engineers therefore hid the device in a cluster of flags . <P> Woodrow Wilson said in part : " We told our fellow men throughout the world , when we set up the free state of America , that we wanted to serve liberty everywhere and be friends of men . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than an occasional word . No one had told Woodrow Wilson about the hookup . <P> He had spoken , not from the stand , but from a hatchway 20 feet away . <P> The Presidential radio debut had been a flop . But four days later Woodrow Wilson used the contraption to talk to his Assistant Secretary of the Navy in Washington - a gentleman who was to become the most celebrated radio figure in history .
