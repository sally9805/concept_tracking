Scientists , like poets , are peculiar people . That is a fortunate fact for civilization , thinks Zoologist John R. Baker of Oxford University , who fears that the world may wind up with a planned society after the war . He has written a bitter book , The Scientific Life ( Macmillan ; $2.50 ) , demanding that scientists be allowed to be as queer as they please . <P> A British admiral 's son who has spent much of his scientific life investigating savages in the New Hebrides , Zoologist Baker believes that scientists are in grave danger of being regimented into total sanity . An arch-individualist , he holds that scientists must have complete freedom of inquiry . In support of his theory that most great scientists have been rather odd , and many of their discoveries the result of accident rather than planning , he presents some persuasive evidence : <P> &gt;The great 18th-Century British chemist and physicist Henry Cavendish ( discoverer of nitric acid , the chemical composition of water , etc. ) was so unsociable that he " was known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a frightened animal " ; he was also so unworldly that when asked for a handout for a sick employe , he offered 10,000 . <P> &gt;Geneticist William Bateson was so backward in school that his headmaster wrote : " It is very doubtful whether so vague and aimless a boy will profit by University life . " He remained fabulously vague : he would buy a ticket to a play and show up by mistake at a musical show , grub in his garden in a brand-new suit and go to London in dirty old garden flannels . <P> &gt;People ignorant of scientific method , says Author Baker , are " apt to imagine that a substitute for sugar would be discovered by a research undertaken for the purpose of finding a substitute for sugar . " Not at all , he snorts ; saccharin was actually discovered by two chemists engaged in a wholly irrelevant attempt to make orthosulfobenzoic acid from orthotoluene-sulfonic acid . <P> &gt;William Hyde Wollaston ( discoverer of the elements palladium and rhodium ) , a silent , austere recluse , once had a visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his butler , had his " laboratory " wheeled in on a tea tray . <P> &gt;The great chemist August Kekul discovered the theory of the benzene ring in a dream about snakes , in which one of the snakes seized its own tail and the image whirled scornfully before his eyes . <P> Surveying contemporary research in the light of this evidence Author Baker finds few signs of genius at work , is depressed by a trend toward ever greater organization and utilitarianism in modern scientific investigation . ( U.S. publication of his book comes in the midst of a fierce debate among scientists on the Kilgore Science Mobilization bill , now in the Senate Military Affairs Committee , which would set up a $200,000,000 agency for Government-planned research . ) Glooms Baker : " A dreary uniformity descends.
