Of all Americans occupying elective office , the man who knows most about the Far East is almost certainly Congressman Walter H. Judd ( Republican ) of Minnesota . On March 15 , in the House of Representatives , he made the most comprehensive speech yet made on the subject . As the U.S. war effort in the Pacific gains momentum , his speech gains , if anything , in timeliness . Therefore TIME publishes extensive excerpts from it : <P> We got into this war through Asia ; and if America gets into another war , almost certainly it will also be through Asia . <P> But there are few subjects about which American thinking is more confused today than it is about China . During 1938 , 1939 , and 1940 , when I was going up &; down the country reporting what I had seen in China in the preceding years , including a period of five months under the Japanese Army , and trying to awaken my fellow citizens to the dangers of Japan 's and our own policies at that time , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about the Japanese . You are unduly alarmed . After all , the Japanese ca n't even lick the Chinese , and of course the Chinese ca n't fight , so what could the Japanese do to us ? " <P> Then one morning Japan gave us the worst defeat in our whole 168 years of independent history . We woke up with a start and said : " Why , those Japanese are good . And if they can do that to us , how in the world have the Chinese been able to hold out against them for four and a half years ? The Chinese must be good , too . " Our estimate of the Chinese began to soar . <P> Idealization , Disillusion . Then Madam Chiang came to this country and she captured American imagination as few foreigners ever had , and certainly as no Asiatic ever had . Our estimate of the Chinese soared still higher-too high . To hear many Americans talk , including commentators and columnists , practically every Chinese was wholly selfless in his devotion to his country , patriotically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so forth . We who had lived there were concerned , and Chinese leaders were even more disturbed , because we and they knew that it was not a true picture of the situation in China or in any country , and that such over-idealization would inevitably lead to a swing-back into over-disillusionment . We are in the midst of that swing-back now . Those who a year ago could hardly find words good enough with which to describe our Chinese allies now can hardly find words bad enough . To hear them talk now , all Chinese are lazy , are crooks , and grafters , are obstructionists , antiforeign , hopelessly inefficient , split up into political factions interested more in preserving themselves than in defeating Japan , expecting us to do all the fighting , and so forth , and so forth . Between those two extremes , where is the truth ? Some of you have asked me that question . I thought if you were going to ask my views , I ought to have a fresh look at the situation . I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel of things as they are in China today . So I went out to China last fall for that purpose . <P> I had worked there ten years as a medical missionary , one year in Nanking , five years in south China , and four years in north China . I was able to talk in their own language with many Chinese whom I had known well in the past , doctors with whom I had worked , nurses we had trained in
