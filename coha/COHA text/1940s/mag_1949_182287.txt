By gobbling big &; little banks and begetting new ones , crusty , crafty old ( 78 ) Amadeo P. Giannini had built his Bank of America into the world 's biggest ( 522 branches ) . His Transamerica Corp. , which owns 23% of the bank , had become the world 's biggest bank holding company . Many big &; little bankers have viewed his bigness with alarm , but none more loudly than Federal Reserve Board Member Marriner S. Eccles . <P> Last week , in FRB 's Washington hearing room , Giannini and Eccles met face to face . In the first use of its antitrust powers in 34 years , FRB was out to prove Transamerica a monopoly . To the witness stand went Eccles . He had disqualified himself as a judge in the case , only to find that as far as Giannini was concerned , it was Eccles who was on trial . <P> While A.P . glowered , Eccles testified that Transamerica had agreed to stop buying up banks , except with FRB approval , after 1940-and then had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not so , claimed Transamerica attorneys . FRB had added restrictions which made it impossible for them to comply with the agreement . <P> During a recess , Eccles stopped by Giannini 's seat and extended his hand . " Nothing personal intended , you know , " he began . A.P . blazed : " You 're trying to put the Bank of America out of business and you ca n't do it . None of your gang can ! " <P> With a faint , embarrassed smile , Eccles walked back to the stand . A.P . ' s attorneys tried to lay the complaint to Eccles ' " personal bias and prejudice . " Eccles conceded that , through the Eccles Investment Co. , his family owns 44% of the stock of First Security Corp . of Ogden ( Utah ) , which advertises itself as " the largest banking institution in the intermountain states . " But he insisted that that had nothing to do with his fear that Transamerica was a monopoly . <P> As FRB was trying its own complaint Giannini seemed to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But neither A.P . nor Eccles thought that the hearing was any more than a sparring round . The fight to the finish would probably be in the U.S. Supreme Court .
