Henceforth most U.S. warplanes will go into action bright and shining except for the dull black patches brushed on surfaces which reflect sunlight into airmen 's eyes . Only " where tactical considerations require it in combat zones " will camouflage be used any more . <P> Reason : radio direction finders are not fooled by camouflage , and the little bit of concealment that it gave planes on the ground under enemy air attack is hardly needed any more . A shiny plane aloft is just as hard to see as a painted ship . An unpainted plane is also a little lighter , a little faster : without paint , fighters weigh less by 15 to 20 lb. , bombers by 70 to 80.
