Ekdahl of Providence , R.I. : " I . . . hope to get back to my outfit in the near future . I 've got more to fight for now as most of my buddies will be staying on that island forever . People back home will never know what it was like to take Iwo Jima . . . . All the time . . . I never feared for myself be cause I knew the Lord was with me . . . . " <P> Wrote Pfc . Felix J. Murphy Jr . of Bellaire , L.I. : " It still does not seem possible that so much hell could have been all in one place . Someone 's prayers were answered , also mine , because I came out . . . . I do n't really think I was afraid to die , but I was afraid of something . . . . I felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just kept on praying . . . . "
