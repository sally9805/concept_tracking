Like U. S. Congressmen , U. S. educators keep an alert ear cocked at their constituents . They seldom hear much . Aside from a noisy minority of taxpayers , patriots and zealous parents , most citizens take their schools for granted , do little kibitzing . But last week , in a Gallup poll arranged by the American Council on Education and its subsidiary , the American Youth Commission , the U. S. people told what they thought about their schools . Some findings : <P> &gt;To the question , " Is too much importance placed on education these days ? " 73% said " No . " Of the 21% who said " Yes , " half complained that education was not sufficiently practical . <P> &gt; 85% believed that youngsters get a better education in school today than their parents did . Only 4% complained of modern " frills . " <P> &gt; 47% thought the amount spent on schools was about right ; 19% , not enough ; 14% , too much ; 20% did n't know . <P> &gt; 72% believed pupils should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poor people . Most tolerant : college graduates , city people . <P> &gt; 47% thought teachers were fair in discussing debatable questions : 26% thought they showed bias ; the rest qualified their answers or did n't know . Most skeptical of teachers ' fairness were college graduates . <P> &gt; 78% advocated spending as much money per capita for Negroes ' education as for whites ' . <P> &gt; Two out of three with opinions ( 23% had none ) agreed that some States were less able than others to support schools . Of that two-thirds , a majority favored Federal aid to schools .
