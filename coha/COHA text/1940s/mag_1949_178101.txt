Few institutions are dearer to the heart of Harry Truman than 1 ) the Democratic Party , .2 ) Missouri , 3 ) the Masonic Order . Last week , as a U.S. President , an ever-loyal Missourian , and a Past Grand Master of Missouri 's Masonic Grand Lodge , he had an opportunity to honor all three . Boarding an Air Force Constellation in Washington , he headed back home with obvious anticipation . <P> He arrived in St. Louis after nightfall , went to bed early in his Sheraton Hotel suite , and got up at daylight for a fast eight-block walk in the sharp autumn air . At 7:30 , clear-eyed , hungry and full of fun , he sat down to breakfast with some old Masonic friends and happily demonstrated a trick dime-store camera with a lens which shot out on the end of a spring like an escaping glass eye . <P> " Grand Master Harry . " Refreshed and stimulated , 33rd degree Mason Harry Truman got into a well-pressed cutaway and striped trousers for the big event of the day-installing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Grand Master of Missouri Masonry . Crowds gathered hurriedly as he set out to walk the block down Lindell Boulevard from the hotel to the Scottish Rite Cathedral . The President , trailed by his White House staff , doffed his silk topper right &; left to well-wishers , grinned at a wag who yelled : " When are you coming over to the Knights of Columbus ? " <P> Inside the cathedral he fell dutifully into the impressive routine of Masonic ceremonial . He entered a stuffy robing room to tie on his little lambskin apron trimmed with heavy gold fringe . He marched soberly down a corridor to the main hall , waited a full two minutes while a guide gained admittance for " Most Worshipful Past Grand Master Harry Truman . " Then , as fellow Masons applauded , he walked to an altar , lit by three electric candles , to begin the induction of officers . <P> During the ceremony he recalled the moment , in 1940 , when he himself had become Grand Master of the Missouri Grand Lodge . He said , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider it , the highest honor that ever came to me . " <P> The President departed amid more applause . But his big day was only just beginning ; that afternoon he flew on to Kansas City for a testimonial dinner honoring the Democratic Party 's new national chairman : curly haired , red-faced Billy Boyle , who worked his way to the top from a humble beginning as a doorbell-pushing ward heeler . <P> Banquet of the Century . The home folks of Kansas City were proud of Bill Boyle-none more vociferously than shrewd , elephantine Roy Roberts , Republican president of the Kansas City Star- and they had vowed to give him the banquet of the century . By the time the President entered Kansas City 's vast civic auditorium that night , they had come comfortably close to success .
