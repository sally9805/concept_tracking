txt " It takes about a month for a letter to be delivered from here across that river , " said a German in GOrlitz when I returned from viewing the bare 50 yards of water which today separates Germany from Poland along the southern stretch of frontier . This river Neisse , the so-called Western Neisse , a tributary of the river Oder , is indeed a strange frontier . It is neither wide nor deep ; it is not a fast-flowing river with mountains on one side  --  in the tradition of water frontiers . Rather it is a slow , placid stream running across flatland . At this point , it divides the ancient town of GOrlitz in two parts . Strange Frontiers Some strange frontiers were fashioned in the peace treaties after World War I , such as the river Tesin ( Cieszyn in Polish ) which passes through the town of that name and which separated Czechoslovakia from Poland . Or there was the peculiar situation which used to exist in Upper Silesia , where one entered a bus outside the town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed car , since both er ds of the journey were in Polish territory but the middle part in Germany . In both these cases , however , apart from claims of nationality , valuable coal deposits also played an important role in the decision . Population German Those were the days when rights of self - determination counted for much . Here in Gen.-Ltz , however , we are in an agricultural plain , and the population is predominantly German . The issue appears to have been decided only according to how far the Poles could venture westward so as to obtain as much compensation as possible for the eastern territory they had to surrender to the Soviet Union . Today one half of GOrlitz town certainly does not know what the other half is doing . Roads on both sides automatically were linked in former days across river bridges . German automobile association signs still indicate the distances to places on the other side . One Bridge Stands But all the bridges have been destroyed except one . And the Neisse viaduct , which is the only direct railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silesia has been blown up . Road transport nowadays must cross the wooden bridge , guarded on one side by Russian soldiers and on the other by Polish . The trolleybus which formerly went to the other side of the river now turns around at the bridge and returns to GOrlitz town . A huge red-letter sign with the words , " Polish Republic , " meets the eye across the bridge , which only three or four Germans cross daily . And they are technicians supplied with frontier passes by the Russian Kommandatura because they have jobs on the other side . Forest and Mines Lost For there still is some work which must be done over there , although arrangements have been made whereby each side of the river now is able to carry on independently in most things . There still are some coal mines and a large forest covering 30 , - 000 hectares ( 74,100 acres ) belonging to the city of ** across on the Polish side . And the City Council still casts regretful eyes in their direction . After nearly two years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminating gas supplies from Waldenburg , nearly 80 miles away in Polish territory , whereas until April , 1947 , it had to be satisfied with only two hours of gas daily . Compromise Reached This change was due to a compromise whereby the Poles get electricity from a power station near Zittau in exchange for the gas . GOrlitz itself has escaped the destruction of war despite the fact that for 13 weeks a battle raged in its vicinity . Here are no ruins and no rubble . Except for difficulties due to the shortage of raw materials , its 90,000 population , nearly a third of whom are refugees . live a more or less normal life . They continue to work in industries such as wagon making and machinery factories . The Germans talk with some envy of material conditions on the other side , about stores " over there " being full of goods of all sorts which they have not had for a long time , especially coffee . Tour Held Up BEALIN , June 20 ( 11:1 ? liussian authoritieS held up a conducted tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American correspondents and photographers a few hours before it was scheduled to start June 18 . The Russian action came only three days after a group of 10 Russian correspondents started a 10-day tour of the American Zone .
