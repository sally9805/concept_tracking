In the London Daily Express office during the war , Editor Arthur Christiansen used to notice a lackadaisical G.I. in a typical G.I. pose-leaning against the wall of the sub-editors ' room and blankly chewing gum . One day Christiansen struck up a conversation with the leaner , found that he was soaking up the newspaper atmosphere for future use . His name : Sergeant Richard Vesey . <P> Not long ago , Dick , back home and demobilized , learned that Chris was coming to the U.S. He wrote him a friendly challenge : " Do n't just visit New York and Washington , like most visitors . Come on out here and see the real U.S. " Like most visitors , Arthur Christiansen went to New York and Washington-and to Hollywood , where the cocktail parties were " regal , magnificent . " But last week the editor of the world 's largest daily newspaper ( circ. 3,856,375 ) paid a visit to his friend Dick Vesey , now a University of Wisconsin journalism student , at his home town of Plymouth , Wis. ( pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chris and his blonde wife Brenda strolled along Plymouth 's Mill Street . They talked shop with the editor of the weekly Plymouth Review ( circ. 2,100 ) , visited a cheese factory , munched Schwaller 's hamburgers ( " biggest in Wisconsin " ) . Sighed Chris : " It 's wonderful ! " Editor Christiansen , a gregarious man with a florid cherub 's face and a mockingbird 's sense of humor , felt as much at home in Plymouth as he does back home in Holland-on-Sea . <P> Godlike Voice . Christiansen gets along with people . His journalist 's creed is simply : " People , people , people ! " This formula , plus his enormous energy , made him editor of Lord Beaverbrook 's flamboyant Express at 29 . In his first year , 1933 , he raised the circulation 160,000 , made the Express the world 's biggest daily . And he has kept it there ever since . Into a four-page paper , Christiansen and his editors pack as many as 70 brisk , brief , breezy news stories , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typography ( when the " Ink Spots " quartet visited London recently , the headline was four ink blots ) . <P> The staff of the Daily Express is the best paid in Fleet Street , and Christiansen says it has the hardest-working editor . He gets up at 8:30 , reads the papers until 10 , then makes for the bathroom . There he reads and shaves at the same time . <P> At a pre-luncheon conference with his editors , he talks over the news . After lunch , he criticizes stories , confers with the night staff , often rewrites the editorials . Says he : " We never waste space saying ' On the one hand . ' . . . We just state an opinion in a godlike voice . " <P> Common Touch . But it is by his alternately nagging and praising daily bulletins that Christiansen puts his mark on the Ex-Press . Excerpts : " Such a coverage ! Such splendour ! Such magnificence ! From Newell Rogers in Washington to Ralph Campion in Cock Fosters the heart of this paper beats strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news .. . . The headline WIFE SITS ON TAIL OF PLANE in the Daily Mail is a better headline than our HOLIDAY PLANE IN SEA . . . . Why does the phrase The British taxpayer must foot the bill ' appear ? . . . Why not ' The taxpayer pays ? ' The phrase is absurd and should not be used . . . . "
