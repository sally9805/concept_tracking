The last Jap holds on the Philippines were being pried loose . On Mindanao last week two U.S. Army divisions were pressing close to Davao . A second landing was made on Negros . Major General Innis P. Swift 's I Corps , racing the rainy season that starts in mid-May , stepped up its drive over the razor-backed ridges of northern Luzon and captured Baguio , summertime capital of the islands . <P> From Luzon TIME Correspondent William P. Gray radioed : <P> The mountain war for Baguio may be remembered best in time to come as the war of the Igorot women . Scores of these sturdy , brown , barefoot descendants of headhunters have padded softly out of Baguio and down through the protecting jungles into the U.S. lines . Now they are climbing back , carrying rations , water and ammunition for the 33rd Division , helping to solve a tough problem in mountain logistics . <P> Each morning the Igorot women line up beside the road , standing or squatting like bright salt shakers on a shelf , awaiting their orders for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house dresses , though their men frequently wear only loose-tailed shirts and red G-strings . <P> The women go where the bulldozers have not gone and the trucks can not go . They carry their burdens on their backs , holding them with thin , woven bamboo head straps . Each woman takes up to 50 pounds , one-fourth the load saddled on pack horses on the same trails . But there are six times as many Igorot women available as pack horses . <P> First Forty . It was the women 's own decision to go to war . There was a shortage of men carriers and 40 women volunteered . The Army paid them 1.50 pesos a day . The first day they made three times as many trips as the men . At least one battalion of the 33rd Division lived and fought last week on supplies , carried up by the Igorot women . When Japs fired on the trails the men dropped their loads and scattered ; the women , undisturbed , plodded on in a long single file to the front . <P> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is also Aning Andao , a wizened old lady in a brocaded black head cover , grey striped shirt and patched quilted skirt , wearing an athlete 's gold medal around her neck . She has the milky rings of old age around her irises and old cigar stains on her teeth , but she can climb and carry with the best of them . <P> All , with soft rippling laughs , will tell you what they see on their way to the front . Said one : " First we came on 20 dead Japs . Then , farther up the trail , we came to a place where there were 40 . And when we got up where the soldiers were , there were more than 100 dead Japs . It was a beautiful sight . "
