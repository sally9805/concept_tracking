MY PIGEON PAIR A STORY BY DOROTHY THOMAS f NNY had left two folded extra blan- kets for me on the large chair at the foot of her bed and the bed was turned down . The studio was very like others she had lived in , and it was strange to see her bright-colored and oddly matched furniture without her large person moving awkwardly about to make me feel at home among it . All her paintings stood in a dovetailed outlining row on the floor against the four walls of the room . In the bathroom , above the old-fashioned oval wash basin , hung two medicine cabinets . The one with the red loop of ribbon hung from its latch would be Jenny 's and the other her roomer 's . I wondered if Jenny 's roomer had come home and was then in the little room beyond the bath 's other door . I was tired from my trip , and I had had my dinner on the train and so wanted only to get to sleep and be really rested for the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the student lamp that arched from the table at the end of Jenny 's bed , re-read the note she had sent me . Leaving key with supt. she had written in her generous hand . Have to be away but want you to use studio just the same . Ring Supt. bell . Do n't try to keep food . Roaches and no ice . Eat out . Sleep in studio . Bedroom rented out to girl who clerks . Has own door to hall and bath and wo n't bother you . Has boy friend . May he there . May not . Walls thin . If she cries at night , never mind it . Hope elevated does n't keep you awake . Have a good time . Sorry to miss you . Love , Jenny . I turned off the light , and the squares of the window went from dark blue to gray blue , patterned with rows of lights . The window squares threw a wavering pattern on the wall and on Jenny 's haphazard pieces of furniture , and in my weariness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been under water , that the huddling chairs had been washed where they stood , and that the pictures round the room were flotsam . The elevated trains , on a level with the storey below , roared like some mighty chance-timed surf . Rest , comfort even , was not easily come by in Jenny 's matter-of-fact bed . I lay and tried to get used to the noise of the trains and of the cars , trucks , and buses in the street below . After a little I heard a key turning in the lock and started up , thinking someone was trying to get into the room , and then lay back , remembering the little girl in Jenny 's bedroom . The wall was very thin , for I could hear the girl 's slow step , and knew quite well as she moved about what she was doing . I saw her in my imagining hanging up her coat in a mothproof cardboard cupboard like the one in the studio where I lay , laying her turban and her cotton gloves away in the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen end of her little room . It must be that the room was about the size of Jenny 's bathroom . I heard her turning on the switch of the little electric plate : low , medium , high , and the little click of each turn . Then she filled a small teakettle with water at the bathroom tap  --  I heard the lid fitted on the kettle and then the grating sound of it being slid on to the burner . A spoon tapped against the side of a smaller pan . I imagined the girl with a limp organdy apron tied about her waist , an apron sent her at Christmastime from an aunt in Iowa to remind her of home . Jenny assured me that almost all New York young people were from States away . I saw her stand patiently waiting for the gray-pink coils to turn fiery red and for the water in the kettle to heat . I heard the sound of a plate thumped down on the enamel-topped table , and then knife , fork , and spoon put beside it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emptied and saved jelly glass . A little afterward the smell of coffee came to me , the girl slid a chair to the table and sat down to eat . I wondered how it was that she had come from work so late . Obviously she had not eaten out . There were places possibly where a girl who clerked could shop after work . I wondered if the friend Jenny spoke of in her note would be coming to see the girl . I hoped that he would come and lift the tiredness that was in her steps by saying they would go to a movie . The girl shoved back her chair and for moments walked briskly and determinedly about the room . She was putting things to rights it was plain . She took pillows from the bed against the wall , spanked them , and tossed them back . Then she went back to the table . Whatever disorder there had been in the room had annoyed her , I told myself , and she had needed to right it before she could enjoy her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway that slowed near the studio door , and then the train thundered below , and when quiet came again there were voices in the room beyond the wall . The girl was saying , " I thought you were n't coming . I waited and you did n't come . " " I 'm sorry , " the man said . " I could n't make it . " Both their voices were young , the girl 's tired , determinedly steady , with , I felt , kept-back reproach in it . " I thought something must have held you up , " she said . " I waited . " " I 'm sorry , " the boy said . " It 's all right , " the girl said . " I warmed up some stew . Will you have some ? I 've had all I want . " " No . No , thanks , " the boy said , and his voice was both tired and wary . " You go ahead and finish your supper . " " Well , some coffee then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Thanks . " " Wait ! Here , let me poke a fork in the holes of this milk can . They stop up . The milk 's all right though . I opened it just last night , and it 's been in the shaft window all day . There ! I 've been meaning to go out and get a little pitcher , but I ca n't seem to remember it at noon . " I heard the rattle of cup and saucer on the enamel-topped table . Then the girl 's voice came , tender , half-afraid to ask . " You did n't find anything ? " " Nope . " " Here , take some more milk . Take some sugar . " " Thanks . " " Allen ? " " Urn ? " " What 's the matter ? " " Nothing . " " I have n't done anything , have 1 ? " " No , a-course not . " " Then why  --  why did you draw your hand away when I touched you ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you drew away . " " Do n't imagine things , Judy ! " " I do n't mean to . " " The old girl gone ? " I had been listening as you listen to a radio serial , so lost in their talk that I had forgotten I was listening , and I was startled to have them speak of Jenny . " Yes , she 's out of town . I saw her yesterday in the hall , giving Mrs. Grimes the key . " " You pay her before she left ? " " I sure did . That 's what I pay first , my rent . Nobody can say anything to you , about anything , if your rent 's paid . " There was a sudden sharpness in her voice . A train came . When I heard them again the boy was up from his chair , walking the little he could walk , in the length there was in the tiny room . Then he sat down heavily on the bed , and I heard a chair being slid across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There , stretch out , Allen , and rest , and please , honey , put your cigarettes in this ash tray . " " That an ash tray ? " There was lightness and a trying at humor in the boy 's voice . " It may look like a saucer to you , but it better be an ash tray . " How quick she was to answer his lightness with hers . I heard her bring water from the bathroom , and at the little table wash the few dishes and then set them away in the cupboard over the table . The boy lay on the bed . When she had finished she came to the bed and sat down beside him . " Hello , Allen , " she said . " Hello , Judy , " lie said . He patted the round of her slender arm . I wanted to get up , to take hold of Jenny 's heavy bed and drag it to some other part of the room , as far from the thin wall and from them as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was there , that they believed themselves alone now , after the many times of reminding each other that Jenny was there and might hear them . I tried to remove myself from them in my thoughts , to leave them to themselves and to whatever happiness their being there together could bring them . I did my best to feel as a city woman might feel , to hear without hearing , without caring ; but it was not easy to a night ear tuned to snow sliding from eaves or branches and to the far harking of neighbors ' dogs . I put my mind on the trains and listened for them , counted between their comings , and waited for and heard those crashings in the street below that to a city ear mean nothing at all if heard , and to me are astounding . The boy and girl talked on , and I heard every word that they said between the coming of the trains . The girl seemed so eager that they be at peace , with no difference between them , seemed ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she held against him . " Allen , " she said , " why do n't you talk to me ? " The young man sighed and stirred . " I ca n't . I do n't want to talk . What is there to say ? " The girl was still a while and then said , " You used to talk . You used always to have something to say , things you 'd been waiting to say  --  saving for me . " " Did I ? " There was a little tenderness , along with wonder at this old self of his she spoke of , in his voice . " What did I say ? " " You know what you said . I know , I remember every word , but I do n't want to say it . You do n't want me to say it for you , do you ? Say it back to you ? What good would that be ? " " No good , I guess , Judy . Why do we have to talk ? " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " " Yes . " Her voice was low so that I could hardly hear it , and very gentle . " ' You 're my treasure , mysweet ! " she said . " You used always to say that to me . ' My treasure . ' Now , I say it to you . ' My treasure ! ' " Her voice broke suddenly on the word " treasure , " and I felt , more than heard , felt it through the thin wall , that he had taken her by the arms and was shaking her . " Judy , " he said , " do n't be like this , honey . Ca n't we just be quiet ? Ca n't I come here and we just rest , just be quiet ? Why do we have to be talking ? I came , did n't I ? " " Yes , but after you made me wait ! You let me wait . Do you think I was n't tired waiting there , standing there so long ? I was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Would he wait this long for me ? ' Would you , Allen ? " " I have , times a-plenty . " " That was long ago . That was  --  that was before . Would you wait that long now , Allen , and ever come to see me again if I let you down ? " Trains drowned them . When I heard them again I knew that the boy was holding her in his arms , was caressing her . " You know what 'll happen , Judy , if we go on like this , " he was saying . " My God , I thought last time if we ever went through that again , if you started in talking again about being scared , and what would we do , I 'd go crazy . That 's what we 've got to think about , Judy . Do you think I do n't want to love you ? " The girl laughed suddenly , like a child , and I heard her quick kisses and her voice , between laughing and crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why did n't you say so ? I do n't care ! I do n't care about anything if you love me , if you tell me you love me . Tonight you did n't say it . You did n't come to me and kiss me and say you were sorry you made me wait . You just stood there by the door . Honey , I know I 'm silly but I ca n't help it . If you 'll just say it when you come I can stand just being quiet then , just sitting by you and not talking . I can stand our not being together , or I can stand our being together . I can even stand being scared , like I was last month . I can stand anything ! " " You think you can now , " the boy said , " but ? " " Honey , I do n't think anything . There is n't any-thing I have to think about , but that you love me , that you said it ? " " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I just said , honey , do n't you think I want to love you ? " " Then say it , say it , ' My treasure , ' and I love you , Judy . I will always loveyou ! ' Oh Allen  --  I know I ought n't to talk like this , I try to hold back talking like this . I do n't think a girl ought to , but I love you so ! I can stand on my two feet all day and smile and always be nice to people , because I know  --  I think know  --  that when night comes I 'll maybe see you and I 'll hear you , and you 'll hold me . " " Judy , Judy ! " I heard their kisses . I heard the boy saying doggedly , like a boy talking in sleep , who has fallen asleep trying to work a hard problem , " Judy , we have n't anything . I have n't any job . What would happen to you ? . . . " I wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear , and then , under cover of the roaring of a train , slipped from the bed and went and stood by the studio window , looking down on the tracks and on the street below . I stood with my hands pressed close to my ears , jealous for those two , against myself and my own nearness to their brief and troubled love making . I wished for a succession of trains that would follow one another without ceasing of sound . I got cold standing there , and when a later train was passing I went back to the bed . " You all right , sweet ? " " Ycs . " " You 're not . It was n't right for you again . I know when you pretend . I was afraid it would n't be . Aw , Judy , we 're too tired , too scared . There 's never any peace ! " " Sh ! I 'm all right . I had a fine time , I really had . " " No , you did n't . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel good . " " It was my fault , " the girl said . " It 's just  --  I 'm so tired , that 's all . It ca n't always be like it is sometimes . We know that . " " You 're not sorry ? " " I 'm never sorry . Do n't you remember , honey , how I was n't , that first time . You said , ' My brave , good girl r " " Judy , you think everything 's all right ? " " Yes  --  of course . " " You wo n't be scared , wo n't worry this time ? " " Not unless I need to . It 's all right , Allen . " " Judy ? " " Yes , darling ? " " Do you care if I go to sleep ? " " No , of course not . You go to sleep . " " Will you sleep ? " " Pretty soon I will . I like it , Allen , when you sleep , when you love me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nicest , to have you sleep . When you sleep  --  you know how I feel ? " His voice was distant with drowsiness . " How ? " " Married , that 's how . When you sleep with your head on my shoulder , and breathe slow , Iike you do , fast asleep  --  then I 'm married , we 're married . There 's even  --  do n't you laugh at me , dear a ring on my hand . I can feel it without touching it with my other hand  --  a plain gold band , like my grandmother 's . " Between trains I fell asleep then , and when I woke the girl was crying . She was trying to cry without sound , but I heard her . Finally the boy heard her too and spoke her name . She answered with only stifled crying . " Judy , " he said , " do n't cry . Please do n't cry , darling ! " " I do n't mean to , " the girl said . " Go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you cry . " " I 'll stop as soon as I can . " " Why are you crying ? " " Because  --  because I was so lone-some ! " " Pet  --  you 're not alone . I 'm here . Did you sleep ? Did you dream something that made you lonesome ? " " No , I did n't sleep . I could n't get to sleep . And for a moment , once , I thought I heard her in there . I thought I heard her turning in her bed , that she 'd heard as , but I just imagined that . She 's gone . " " You go to sleep now , Judy . " " I will , I will just as soon as I can . Allen , I was thinking about us , and howit was at first , how you 'd hold me , and I 'd tremble so  --  how just to touch your hand , to look up and see you  --  Allen , what is it that happens ? Here it 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these few times really we 've been together like this , and something 's gone . I love you just the same , I love you awfully , and I know that you love me , but  --  Allen , here , all my life , I wait for love , and it comes , and it 's better than I ever dreamed , and in this little time it changes . I ca n't bear it to change . I got so lonesome and it made me cry . " " Judy  --  do n't cry . I feel like a louse . I think and think about it , about us . I come here , and I think we 'll just talk , just rest , just be quiet together . You 're so nice just to be with , , Judy  --  in the same room , talking . I think I 'll just talk with you , hold you a little ? " " Yes , yes , " the girl said . " Never mind , dear , never mind me talking , go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . I started to meet you and then turned back . I thought I would n't come here any more . Judy  --  we ca n't go on like this ! " " It 's all right , dear . There 's nothing really wrong ! My heavens , ca n't a girl cry a little ? Do n't ever say that , that you 'll not come . I 'd die . I truly should die , Allen . I 'd be lonesome , like I was just now  --  forever ! " He was holding her , comforting her , trying to still her crying that was wild now and unrestrained , like a child 's . Somehow I got away , into sleep , away from her lessening sobs and the boy 's concern . Sleeping , I dreamed that I was lying on a pallet , along with any number of children , visiting children , I thought , cousins who had come to stay the night with us in the country . I was the only child among them awake . I raised up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the sleeping children on the pallets of quilts and blankets , and then I saw the two in - " =.11e. the next room , and they were not grown boy and girl but children , like the rest of us . The girl was still crying a little in her sleep . Near , above me and to one side , was a huge canopied bed , and in it slept my father . But he too had wakened . He was resting on his elbow , looking down and round at all the sleeping children . I saw his beard moving and I felt his voice more than heard it , reverberating through the posts of the high bed and along the floor under me . I heard him talking to himself , in the night , saying a poem , and his poem was one that I half remembered , and I felt his voice and the poem coming down to us on our pallets . I woke and said all that I could remember of the poem to myself , lying there in Jenny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows and waiting for the morning to come : My little children twain , my pigeon pair , How will men deem you ? As eye-delighting as I find you now ? As full of joy ? As passionate as bees Battling with flowers ? Or will a slough of blossomless time engulf you ? Oh , little sweetings , whereto were ye born ? How can I save you ? Wide-eyed I waited for the morning . Only once I heard the girl sigh in her sleep and mumble something . When it was not yet light I heard her getting up , heard her moving from the little room to the bath , walking on tiptoe . Then I heard the tapping of the kettle lid and , after a while , smelled the coffee and heard her setting dishes on the table . There was no sound from the boy . At last the girl spoke to him , and I knew that she was sitting for an instant on the edge of the bed . " Allen , " she said . " Allen , honey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I want to tell you something . Are you awake ? " " Yes , I guess so . " " Allen , I 've fixed your breakfast , honey . You just warm up the coffee a little when you get up . But do n't get up yet . It 's early . " " I 'll get up . " " No , there 's no sense in it . No place you 'll want to go will be opcn for hours yet . You rest a while . " " You going now ? " " Yes . There 's a quarter under the cup in your saucer . I 'm telling you  --  so you 'll be sure to get it . " " No , you take it  --  you 'll need it . " " No , to-morrow 's pay day . " " Well  --  I wish you would n't . Thanks , Judy . Gosh  --  you look pale . " " Do I ? It 's just this light . I 'm all right . Honey , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to-day ! Will you miss me ? " " Yes , Judy . I wish I could come and not make you cry ! " " You did n't make me cry , honcy. told you  --  it was just I got lonesome . A body does sometimes . You 'll come soon again ? " " I ought not . Aw , Judy ? " " I 've got to go now , sweet . You heat the coffee , and first you sleep , just as long as you can . A good day to you , Allen ! " I heard her kiss , not like a lover 's , but a quick , firm , family kiss , that said , " Be good now . Look after things ! Good luck ! " Then the door closed after her , and I heard her feet walking swiftly along the hail , then running , on the stairs . In the growing light I made out Jenny 's paintings lined along the floor , against the walls . Sharp pictures they were , Village doorways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gray snow falling through the wheels of light round them , and each picture forced into brave colors that such places , when I had seen them , had never held for me . The girl 's steps echoed in my mind , and beyond the wall I heard the boy 's breathing in that troubled last sleep before the day .
