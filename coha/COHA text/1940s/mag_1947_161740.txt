In Chile 's most gracious resort city the season was in full swing . Well-heeled Chileans and vacationists from foreign countries splashed in the green Pacific surf at Vina del Mar , took the summer sun on its white beaches 90 miles west of Santiago . Racing fans crowded the clubhouse and the rail at the Sporting Club to see Bromazo win the annual derby this week . <P> In the cream-colored Casino , two Syrian textile magnates risked a fortune at baccarat . Smartly dressed socialites played roulette with 100 peso* chips ; their cooks were there , too-risking two peso chips on the wheel 's turn . If the season ran true to form , at least one despondent loser would sooner or later plunge into the two-foot-deep canal outside the Casino , be ignominiously fished out of the mud unhurt . <P> Vacationists who admired sprightly Via 's well-paved streets and carefully manicured parks could thank both themselves and the Casino . Roughly half of the $3,000,000 gambling take goes to the municipality . Who is going to get the other half is the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an Argentine syndicate operates the Casino . But one of the two managers , Bernardo Vaistij ( of Yugoslav descent ) , has just been hustled across the border by Chilean cops , who suddenly and conveniently discovered that he was wanted by police in Argentina . The other Argentine manager is expected to quit when the season ends in March . Whispered reason : a new administration has come to power in Chile ; the country 's biggest casino is too profitable a business for anyone but a deserving government supporter . <P> <P> *The Chilean peso is worth 4 . A smart operator once bought a 30,000 peso stack , of chips ( worth $1,200 ) at Via , flew to Montevideo where a casino used identical chips , cashed them for 30,000 Uruguayan pesos-worth $15,000.
