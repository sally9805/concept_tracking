BY EVERY ordinary token Lee De Forest should be a bitter , disillusioned old man , a classic example of the inventor subsisting on crumbs while others fatten on the profits of his invention . But for the three-element vacuum tube which he invented a third of a century ago , radio broadcasting as we know it would not exist . Nor would transcontinental and transoceanic telephoning , talking movies , television , facsimile or any of the Arabian-Nights ' wonders of the electric eye . Each year sprouts a new crop of uses for the vacuum tube , until it looks like the greatest invention of the century , on a par in ultimate significance with the steam engine or the electric lamp . Already about $6,000,000,000 in industries and more than 1,000,000 jobs have grown out of De Forest 's audion . Yet , if all De Forest 's worldly possessions were turned into cash , the proceeds would barely buy the smallest of the nearly 900 radio stations in the country . De Forest was legally proclaimed a " failure " late in 1936 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes and automobiles had reached 33,000,000 , the man who broadcast Caruso 's voice as early as 1910 was filing a petition in bankruptcy . He listed nearly $104,000 in debts , less than $400 in assets . Since then , De Forest 's financial tires have been pumped up somewhat . Two radio schools pay him retainers for the glamour of his name and supervision of courses ; he is the founder and technical director of a small , but growing , Hollywood enterprise called the Lee De Forest Laboratories . Chief product of the laboratories is diathermy machines , which is not without its irony ; diathermy being probably the most troublesome source of radio interference today . As one engineer remarked , " You might say the father of broadcasting has been reduced to static . " Were an artist to paint De Forest simply from the clippings that have accumulated in newspaper morgues , weathered into the face would be the wreckage of a lifetime 's futile quest for riches and of the perpetual inner storms of a hungry rebel who , from childhood on , fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth would be that of a man thwarted at every turn . He wanted an heir to perpetuate his name and had to watch his only two sons die . He built a lavish country estate with a Japanese garden , lawn fountains , an arti-ficial waterfall , only to have it foreclosed . Once , to escape arrest , he had to flee to Canada ; another time he was indicted for claiming that someday he would be able to speak across the Atlantic . Within two years after his trial , through his invention , the Atlantic was spanned , but De Forest January 17,1942 to repair his fortunes through the inflation . In 1913 , De Forest pawned his watch and his wife 's ring to make talking movies . Nearly ten years later he succeeded , but no one in Hollywood was interested . Crossing the Atlantic on the same boat with William Fox , De Forest sent in his card , to be ignored . Four years later , Fox was converted , and whose system of making sound pictures did he buy ? Theodore Case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been working with De Forest . They quarreled . Fox bought Case 's system , essentially like De Forest 's , for $1,500,000 . Fortune 's Stepchild P ROBABLY no man living has missed greater opportunities than De Forest . At a private luncheon , David Sarnoff , the $100,000-a-year president of the Radio Corporation , once confessed that he , like everyone else in the radio business , owed his job to De Forest 's audion . De Forest might have been the RCA ; he might have been sound movies ; he might have been a multimillionaire ; he might have been so many things that the artist could paint into his face as much frustration as any man could endure . Actually , at sixty-eight , hardly a wrinkle breaks his cherubic cheek and his rosy complexion could serve for a soap advertisement . He laughs easily and gaily ; his eyes dance with new dreams . After a full day at the laboratories , he spends two or three hours at night studying . On Sundays he hikes twenty miles across the Southern California countryside ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stocking with his lunch around his stomach and climbs some mountain . He has topped 14,500-foot Mt . Whitney three times in the past five years . Even if fame were not assured him by his invention , De Forest would go down the ages as one of the most singular characters of our time . A friend once described him as " a dynamo without much insulation . " Tall and thin , pinched cheeks stretched taut by high cheekbones , blue eyes burning in deep sockets , he seems all nervous energy , ever in danger of exploding or burning himself out . was not allowed to see it done . A policeman barred his way . More clearly than any of his wireless contemporaries , De Forest foresaw the future . To the penetrating eyes , however , the artist would have to add a caged gleam , for , whenever De Forest was about to clutch his reward , some unseen hand snatched it away , some contradiction in his character tripped him up . He suffered enough had luck to drive any ordinary man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to cheat himself . During the first World War , France and Germany used thousands of vacuum tubes . De Forest would have prospered from the royalties , only , less than two years before , unable to beg or borrow $125 to keep his European patents in force , he lost his rights . For a time he was the lone broadcaster in all the world . He filled the air with " radio concerts , " news and even advertising of a primitive sort , until an irritated Federal radio inspector shut him up . The next year commercial broadcasting was born . De Forest missed out in the boom that followed , having gone to Germany And his career has been a succession of dazzling brilliances and sputtering short circuits . When he was twenty-eight , spurning the advice of friends , he tore out of Chicago for New York to race Marconi for American wireless honors . Marconi enjoyed the advantages of world-wide fame as the inventor of wireless , of five years ' prior experimentation , of financial backing . De Forest had to borrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company was the leading wireless concern in the United States  --  and then De Forest was thrown out of the company like a blown fuse . " Betrayed " in business and love  --  his affairs of heart and pocket have a strange way of going bankrupt simultaneously  --  he determined to give wireless a voice . In two years he again was being feted as a " wireless wizard " and was worth nearly $1,000,000 ? on paper . The collapse of this second fortune almost sent him to prison . He was close to forty then , his name under a cloud , a second dream of love smashed , compelled to work for a former competitor , when , in a few months , he made a discovery for which engineers had hunted for years . Once again he was rich , with chauffeurs and limousines , a country estate and a chateau on the Riviera . This third fortune apparently dissipated in fruitless experiments , extravagance and stock-market gambling , he sold the last of his radio birthright for $600,000 , to have that , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Radio City , which has been described as " the cathedral of the vacuum tube , " was being completed , De Forest was broke and jobless . He was sixty years old , a whole lifetime of effort lay behind him , well over $1,000,000 in cash , in addition to paper millions , had passed through his hands , and all he had to show for it was debts . Literally everything had to go wrong for De Forest to fulfill his destiny ; the shoe had to fall off for want of a nail , the horse lamed , the rider thrown , the battle lost , for the kingdom to be won . Books and plays have been written around the idea that if only one little thing had not been amiss , history might have been swerved in its course . With De Forest the theme is topsy-turvied . The shape of our world might be different if one of a hundred things had gone right with him . In many ways his career parallels that of Columbus . Like him , De Forest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of one thing and found another ; when he made his epochal discovery he had no idea what it was . There is one important difference : Columbus died protesting to the last that the islands he had stumbled upon were the Indies . De Forest has lived long enough to seethe world he made possible flourish and honor him as its father . Unlocking a New World Pr HE new scientific continent for which mankind 1 is indebted to De Forest is that of the electron , the tiniest , most agile particle of electrical energy known . The electron was discovered by J. J. Thomson , a Cambridge professor at twenty-eight , who in 1897 announced that charged particles ? " corpuscles " he called them  --  could be torn from an atom . Until then the atom was regarded as indestructible , the smallest particle known . Nor was De Forest the first to uncover the actual workings of electrons . In 1883 , Edison , whose busy hands seem to have left fingerprints on almost every invention of our age , noticed that electricity could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulb and a metal plate sealed within the bulb , although there was no metallic contact . Edison did n't understand the phenomenon , merely noting it . For twenty-one years this " Edison effect " remained a useless scientific oddity until an Englishman , J. Ambrose Fleming , converted it into a wireless detector . This Fleming valve was still a run-of-the mine invention . What De Forest did was to place a twisted , grid-shaped piece of platinum wire between the filament and plate . It sounds ridiculously simple , but that piece of wire transformed civilization . Call it the twisted hairpin which proved the key to the most intricate scientific locks . Through De Forest 's grid , mankind was given a handle by which the tiny , pell-mell electron could be taken hold of , and its amazing electrical energies controlled and tapped . The weakest flutter could be fed into the vacuum tube through the grid , the stream of electrons rushing between the filament and plate would whirl that signal up and give it new life , amplify it countless times . Today a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly can be ' puffed into a symphony concert . With enough vacuum tubes one can whisper around the globe . Probably half a billion tubes are in use in this country and again as many in the rest of the world . If these tubes suddenly disappeared , every radio station would be hushed , television and facsimile would vanish . The movies would lose their voice , as would all loudspeakers ; **35;1918;TOOLONG go dead ; the aircraft industry , with no systems of blind landing or radio beacons , would be thrust back to flying by the seat of its pants . Magic Wand N  --  ONE of ? the 1001 applications of the photoelectric cell , or electric eye , would be possible  --  the feeble impulse registered by a photoelectric cell must be amplified by a vacuum tube to swing into action . The tubes explain how a high-speed elevator shoots upward in a skyscraper and stops perfectly at the push of a button ; they follow charts , blueprints and dress patterns . Someday they may taste and smell . Called " man 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs by wire and to measure cosmic rays ; for air conditioning , welding , steering ships and controlling printing presses ; in coaxial cables , electric phonographs , organs and pianos . It will locate oil and strategic minerals , spot submarines and airplanes , produce artificial fever and , in the cyclotron , bombard the atom . So sensitive are some tubes that they record the infinitesimal electric currents of the brain  --  valuable in detecting concealed tumors  --  or flickers from stars of the fourteenth magnitude , about one two-hundredth as bright as the weakest star visible to the naked eye . Most of these tricks of the tube have been developed in the past five years ; almost all since 1926 . New ones are found weekly , until the only limitation on this genie seems to be the imagination of his master in thinking up new tasks for him to perform . Recently , David Sarnoff predicted that " as the introduction of individual motors by the electrical age revolutionized the operation of industrial machinery fifty years ago , so the application of electronic devices ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . " The defense program is spurring new tube uses like measuring the speed of bullets , testing airplane instruments for vibrations , and quick-hardening steel . One great tool of this new radio age envisaged by Sarnoff is the electron microscope . Ordinary microscopes magnify objects up to about 2000 times ; ultra-violet-ray microscopes go as high as 5000 times . Beyond that they can not be stepped up , simply because they see by light waves and there is a whole realm of objects smaller than these waves . Attempting to fix the eye on a virus , for example , through a light microscope is like employing a railroad spike to explore a dental cavity . This new microscope sees by electron waves , much shorter than light waves , obtaining magnifications up to 100,000 times . Under it a human hair bulks as thick as a redwood tree . A completely new world of visibility has been opened . Viruses have been seen , giving scientists new hope in their battle against such diseases as influenza , the common cold and infantile paralysis .

Whatever does come out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the three-element vacuum tube . Yet in 1913 De Forest sat in court while a prosecuting attorney held aloft a vacuum tube and demanded that De Forest be sent to prison for inducing people to buy stock in this " worthless " device which was " not even a good lamp . " Was there ever a richer scientific prize , and why should it have fallen to De Forest and not to someone else ? A similar question has often been asked of Columbus . Why , of all the explorers and seafaring men of his time , did he discover America  --  Columbus , the son of a weaver , the foreigner in the Spanish court , the navigator who never had captained a ship before , the geographer who thought the world ridiculously small , the greedy adventurer who demanded royal titles and a 10 per cent commission on the commerce of any lands he discovered ? Of the scientists or inventors who might have found the tube , De Forest was not the most highly trained , most competent or most scientific -- -which is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Ph.D . in electrical engineering at Yale , the course was little more than advanced physics . He never served an apprenticeship under a master  --  his efforts to get such jobs were rebuffed . He was a rebel , a dreamer , a poet . Far from fit . ting the scientific ideal of being wise , humble and self-questioning , he was reckless , arrogant and blind to his own faults , with an alibi for everything that went wrong . Although De Forest today likes to believe that he was inspired by an almost mystic desire to be a great inventor , " his driving ambition seems to have been the very common craving to get rich . Always in love and inventing at the same time , he apparently placed as much , if not more , importance on his love affairs . His diaries during the days when he made his greatest inventions contain only the briefest references to his work and pages of extracts from love letters . As an instance of how careless he could be with his inspirations , in 1918 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jr. , De Forest sketched out an invention for making talking pictures on a sheet of ship 's stationery . On the back he wrote a poem to " Dixie , " one of the ship 's entertainers . Most persons who know De Forest shake a rueful head when they think of As usual , he stopped and looked around in back . At the faded , tarnished walls and the chipped gilt  --  at the Princess as she was . Somehow , tonight , he did n't feel any longing for that young , pert girl of a Princess . The Princess as she was , was no longer a girl , obviously . She was more an elderly lady who knew a trick or two , and knew the world she lived in as no foolish little girl could . " Pure and simple , " Mr. Urlap said to himself , and went home . the opportunities and fortunes he has wasted . Yet , can De Forest be considered a failure ? When you are through with these articles , ask yourself whether he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envied . The household into which De Forest was born was steeped in all those virtues which his career seems to defy  --  reverence , discipline , steadiness , humility , thrift . Lee 's father , Henry Swift De Forest , was a Congregational minister in the then frontier town of Council Bluffs , Iowa . His good-looking mother was the daughter of the Rev. Alden B. Robbins , one of the Iowa band of missionaries who founded Muscatine . Lee was born in the parsonage on August 2G , 1873 , and that night Henry De Forest wrote Lee 's grandmother , " I have desired that , if God so will , Anna , the daughter and wife of a minister , may be also the mother of a minister . " The wish might have been granted but for the fact that when Lee was six his father was offered the presidency of Talladega College for Negroes , in Alabama . The period was during the depths of Reconstruction . Henry De Forest had worked his way through college , and while at Yale Divinity School had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he smoked his first and only cigar to celebrate Grant 's entry into Richmond . To him , the presidency of Talladega came as a " call . " In Alabama , the De Forests found themselves treated like pariahs . Henry De Forest was snubbed and insulted in the streets . What social life the family had was restricted to members of the Talladega faculty . When the " rebs , " as Lee called the town children , rode by the De Forest home , they hurled rocks at Lee and his brother , Charles , five years younger , who retorted in kind . Town was a mile and a half from the college , and Lee sneaked in and out like a fugitive . Save for his brother and sister Mary , two years older , almost the only friends Lee knew were Negroes . Because he was puny and undersized as a child , the bigger Negro children pushed him around , Lee protesting , " Le ' go of me , le ' go of me . " That became his nickname , " Lego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as church mice . Henry De Forest 's salary never amounted to more than $125 a month ; for several years the family of five lived in two rooms in the girls dormitory and ate in the common dining room downstairs . Lee got an allowance of ten cents a month . His father also gave him chickens to raise , and the egg proceeds were his . Lee managed to save up enough money to buy an electroplating outfit , and he silver-plated knives and forks . His only customers , of course , were the faculty . From this harsh world the boy took refuge in. that best of all possible worlds , the world of dreams . He had a vivid , restless imagination . Reading of King Arthur , he built a five-foot " Castle Luxembourg " in the back yard , drafting his Negro friends as Knights of the Round Table . When a blast furnace was erected a mile away , Lee constructed one of his own , using an old ash can and bellows , and pitch-pine chips for fuel . Another day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he lay there , spellbound . Then he tore home to build his own locomotive out of sugar barrels and paint kegs . Even the " rebs " asked permission to view it from close . It was not the last time De Forest forced a hostile society to pay him homage . On rainy days , Lee lay flat on his stomach , with pencil , eraser , ruler and a huge sheet of paper , " inventing " things  --  a windmill , steam hammers , an airship , a Chinese prayer machine  --  this inspired by the visit of some missionaries freshly returned from the Orient . Lee built a farm gate which the driver could open without getting down from his wagon , a cotton picker , fish traps , a handcar , a small steamboat operated by a clockworks motor . He sketched a perpetual-motion machine . Beneath the sketch he wrote that he was " actually amazed that I , a mere youth of 13 years , by my inventive genius and concentrated thought and study , had succeeded where illustrious philosophers in times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become an inventor from this perpetual-motion machine . His ideal was Edison , whom Lee imagined tremendously wealthy . He did a great deal of reading in those days , though only superficially of the lives of inventors . He never learned that inventing things was almost as sure a road to poverty as was the ministry he shunned . The Bottomless Pit Henry De Forest had set his heart on having a minister for a son , and he was not the sort to give up easily . Puritanical sternness was written all over him . He was six feet one , bearded like a prophet , with deep-set eyes that burned with religious fervor . He believed the best preaching was to set an example , and he , literally , was a walking sermon . In a South where menial tasks were left to Negroes , he preached the dignity of labor by chopping wood and mowing the grass in his shirtsleeves . He never allowed Lee or Charles to be idle . If all the chores were done , there was one bit of homemade boondoggling which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a dirt cellar and , as Lee remarks , " I soon learned dirt cellars have no bottoms . " The elder De Forest exhorted his sons to " walk straight , throw your shoulders back . " In the morning he led them in exercise . Prayer , of course , was a daily rite . Under this discipline , Lee acquired both a tremendous capacity for and a hatred of work , both grim perseverance and romantic flightiness . In later life he was always able , when pressed , to toil sixteen and eighteen hours a day , but when necessity relaxed its hold , he bounded off , dreaming . His father had excelled in Greek and Latin , and wanted Lee to study them . Latin , Lee needed to enter scientific school ; Greek , he did not . Latin , Lee learned with diligence ; Greek , he rebelled against as " the hardest no-'count language ever invented . " Henry De Forest did n't understand the boy  --  or perhaps he understood him too well . There was a reckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his diary extracts , De Forest talks of " my frequently ungovernable temper . " The father did not spare the rod . The boy , stubbornly , would refuse to cry , and his father 's arm would come down more heavily . Often after these whippings , Lee would run to his mother , weeping , " I 'm an adopted child or you would n't let me get beat so hard ! " The Land of Dreams His father 's pounding only drove Lee deeper into the refuge of his daydream world  --  all through life De Forest was to carry with him this dream shelter where , no matter how fierce the storm , he could huddle , - dry and warm , and , the fury over , emerge untouched . The ministry came to stand for everything at Talladega  --  the poverty , the tormentings of the " rebs , " the hated routine , the discipline  --  it was a world of denials . Being an inventor held out the promise of that dream existence where nothing would be withheld from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name , asking what to do with a son who wanted to be an inventor ? Lee hoped Edison would reply , " Let the boy do as he pleases . " Edison never answered . Lee tried to enlist the aid of his mother ; finally he refused absolutely to go to college unless it was to a scientific school . His father gave in . A psychologist might say the boy suffered from an inferiority complex born of the " damned-Yankee " ostracism and poverty . And it is true that well into adult life De Forest complained of the handicaps of his childhood . " Inferiority complex , " though , is like the label on a bathroom bottle  --  any quality of perfume or toilet water can be poured into the bottle . " Inferiority complex " can stand for every kind of human being from a nervous wreck to a genius ; it can mean anything and nothing . With De Forest we can be more specific . Hunger was the fuel and imagination the spark that propelled his genius . It was hunger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things of life , and it was no ordinary hunger . Born of denials , it was to keep him divorced from society , as people of normal appetites are wedded to it , for better or worse . De Forest always felt society was peopled with " rebs " bent on holding something from him . Instead of his outgrowing them , his boyish hungers grew up with him . Even when rich , they remained unappeased ; with the hungers of the imagination , the eyes are always bigger than the stomach . Never having learned to partake of life properly , he could only approach it as one starved , either fearing to touch it or wolfing it down . To prepare for Sheffield Scientific School at Yale , Lee went to Mt . Hermon Preparatory School in Massachusetts . Dwight L. Moody , the evangelist , had founded the school to give boys without money an education . Mt . Hermon turned out to be Talladega in a Northern setting . Lee had to dig potatoes , clear rocks from the fields , wait on tables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonesome work , " he complained . and Edgar Allan Poe , an odd , fateful combination . In 1864 , on the basis of mathematical calculations , Maxwell formulated the electromagnetic theory of light  --  that electricity traveled in waves , as did light , and at the same speed . Twenty-odd years later , Hertz demonstrated the existence of these waves ? " hertzian waves " they came to be called . Hertz decided that these waves traveled through the medium of ether , supposedly the all-pervading something that filled the atmosphere . In Poe , the self-tortured genius , De Forest felt he had found a kindred soul . Turning from Hertz to Poe and back again , De Forest 's imagination flamed with the desire to explore the mysteries of the ether , with its " weird truths " and " unreal realities . " Against growing family opposition , he decided on a second year of postgraduate work . Early that fall , Prof. Henry Bumstead gave a lecture in which he duplicated Hertz 's experiments . The waves could be seen leaping the gap between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lecture was a good show , little else . Roentgen had discovered the X ray in 1895 , Becquerel , radioactivity in 1896 , and Thomson , in April , 1897 , the electron . These were the things that excited De Forest 's classmates . But De Forest always preferred to hunt alone . " The fear of men and the hustle and clash of purposes , " he wrote , " is more unpleasant and wears away the life and mental strength more fiercely than any other conflict . . . . I hate such and would a thousand times prefer the most difficult problem and fight with natural forces . . . May this be my lot in life , to live in a little artificial world , away from the crowd and its friction . " Scholastic Black-Out He decided to do his Ph.D . thesis on hertzian waves . His experiments required running wires over considerable distances and he had to work in the evenings , when the laboratory corridor , the only suitable spot , was not in general use . He was constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined to be slapdash . Once during an experiment he hammered some nails into a fine oak laboratory table , and his professor , Charles Hastings , stormed , " A man who has n't any better sense than to drive nails in a table will never amount to anything ! " Professor Hastings was giving a series of evening lectures and warned De Forest not to work on those nights . During one particularly important lecture , out went the lights . As De Forest recalls , " The audience was dismissed by candlelight and I was dismissed by daylight the next morning . " His expulsion coincided roughly with a more epochal explosion  --  that of the battleship Maine . While De Forest sought to get Hastings to relent , the war fever mounted . At first , De Forest decided against enlisting , " now when all has been outlayed on my edu cation and I am about ready to begin to repay the debt . " But " the war spirit got a stronger hold on me , " he records in his diary . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Physically , I am badly off . . . . I am perfectly confident this war can not outlast six months . . . . I do not risk my destiny , I think . . . I can not brook the thought of another summer 's fizzle such as last was . I will make sure of employment now , $13 a month . Then there is the excitement . . . the fellowship with Yale men in field and camp . . . . I have had far too little Yale fellowship in my undergraduate life . " Spain was defeated before De Forest 's battery could be sent to Puerto Rico . Returning to New Haven in October , he found Hastings still adamant . Sheffield , then , was something of a stepchild in the Yale family , and similar courses were given in Sloane Laboratory in the college . De Forest finished his Ph.D . there , cramming nearly two years ' work in one . More threatening to his " destiny , " he fell in love . The girl was Jessie Wallace , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom Lee stopped off before going to Chicago to look for work . Jessie was the first girl to tell Lee that she loved him . De Forest could think only of finding a job that would pay enough to enable him to get married . In Chicago , Western Electric hired him in its dynamo department at eight dollars a week . With room and breakfast costing two dollars a week , Lee figured he could save at least eight dollars a month , " How long thus , " he asked himself , " before I can buy the little girl the ring ? " De Forest admits today , " If we had married I never would have been able to suffer what I had to for my inventions . " Jessie changed her mind . Lee borrowed ten dollars and dashed to Council Bluffs to plead with her  --  to no avail . De Forest now sighs , " It took me years to forget . " He sought solace in work . He had been promoted to the Western Electric laboratory , exulting , " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can learn more here and am with refined and trained gentlemen . I miss the swear words and filthy talk . Here , if ever , I can invent . " What to invent ? It was October , 1899 , and Marconi was making the front pages with his reports of the International Yacht Races . In November , demonstrating for the U. S. Navy , Marconi sent messages thirty-six miles . Later that month the American Marconi Company was formed , capitalized at $10,000,000 . Ten million dollars ! At the time , the great need in wireless was a reliable , sensitive detector . Marconi was using the Branly coherer , a small glass tube filled with metal filings . When the electricity struck . these filings , they " cohered , " or flocked together , forming a bridge across which the signal flew . A little hammer at the side tapped the filings loose for the next signal . De Forest began hunting for a self-restoring detector which would permit the use of a telephone receiver or headphone , increasing the speed of sending . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he duplicated experiments of interest , using the laboratory during his lunch hour or after five o'clock . With his thoughts concentrated on wireless , his telephony work , never very good , grew worse . One day William W. Dean , his superior , exclaimed , " Look here , you 'll never make a telephone engineer . As far as I 'm concerned , you can go to hell in your own way . Do as you please . " Taking Dean at his word , De Forest buried himself off in a corner of the laboratory , totally indifferent to the work for which he was being paid . Edwin H. Smythe , a week younger than De Forest , became interested . He would join Lee after closing hours . Together they soon developed a crude but promising detector which they called the " responder . " It differed from the coherer chiefly in that it maintained a continuous circuit and the signal was heard as a break in the circuit . De Forest wrote to Marconi offering to sell it to him , but Marconi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American Wireless Telegraph Company was being formed in Milwaukee and De Forest applied for a job . Prof. H. L. Johnson , the company head , came to Chicago to inter view him . What would De Forest work for ? De Forest 's salary had been ' raised to ten dollars a week , and the two-dollar increase had loomed so grand that in his diary he had promised himself , " Ah , I shall begin to live indeed , buy a new pair of socks , a phonograph and an automobile at once . " De Forest said , " Fifteen dollars . " He was hired . The Mustache Omen Johnson 's detector was n't much good , and De Forest , whose job was to listen for signals , would sneak out the responder and test it . One day his assistant caught him and told Johnson . The company was on the verge of failure . A letter De Forest wrote Smythe indicates that he , thought of offering the responder to Johnson , but wanted1 to patent it first . When Johnson demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was fired . Far from being discouraged , he returned to Chicago happy . At Milwaukee he had raised a mustache , and looking into the mirror he felt it was an omen of better days . " I can but feel I am at last on the right track , " he told himself , " one destined to make me independent . If there is nothing in me but a dreamer , a visionary , a ne'er-do-well , the sooner I know the better . Let me quit fooling myself and others , and jump overboard . " He and Smythe now entered into active partnership . Lee was to devote all his time to improving the detector . Smythe , who earned thirty dollars a week and was a " comparatively rich man , " would see that Lee got enough to live on and would buy all materials . De Forest taught two nights a week at the Lewis Institute , getting five dollars . Smythe added another fiver .

The receiving equipment was set up on the roof of the Lakota Hotel , about half a mile from the institute . It had begun to rain and by the time Smythe and De Forest reached the hotel it was coming down hard . At 7:30 they heard four rapid whirs , silence , then four more dots for the letter H , the signal agreed upon . For half an hour they took excited turns at the receiver , the rain forgotten . The next day De Forest tested the responder from the Armour Institute to the Chicago Auditorium , four miles , and the following week from a yacht five miles out on Lake Michigan . After that there was no holding him . He had been training himself in the Morse code by translating into dots and dashes the advertisements while riding in streetcars and the elevated . Marconi was coming from Europe to report the International Yacht Races again . De Forest wanted to rush to New York . He would beat Marconi and become famous and rich ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
