txt It was never , of course , going to be like this . If Hitler , the man of a thousand certainties , was more certain of one thing than of all the others , it was that he was not going to repeat the monstrous mistake of his predecessors in 1914 and get himself involved simultaneously in a war on two fronts . It was to be one nation at a time  --  even , where necessary , one bite of one nation at a time . In fact , the German people were led to suppose at first that it was to be wholly a bloodless conquest . First the Rhineland , then Austria , then the Sudetenland , then the rest of Czechoslovakia  --  all without bloodshed , if you do not count a few incidental assassinations . Was not this , thought the majority of Germans , the most brilliant ' diplomat in history ? All that it cost them was the loss of a little butter and free speech , and this was more than compensated by the full employment brought by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels , the dash and color of uniforms and ribands , by fascinating new toys , marvelous tanks and airplanes , by the growing might of Germany and the fear of her all over the world . Germany was so strong that Hitler had merely to threaten and other nations gave him what he wanted without a struggle . What a wonderful formula ! Why had n't they thought of it long before ? The formula failed , it is true , when it came to Poland , but it would be a shame not to try at least once the mighty military machine that had been built up . The machine was tried ; it worked magnificently ; it crushed a strong nation like Poland in a few weeks . And though , in German eyes , the British and French had been " foolish " enough to declare war in the teeth of the agreement with Russia , they could only nibble ineffectively at German territory while the armies of the Reich were overrunning Poland like a flood . Then Hitler , having made his eastern flank secure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victories even more dramatic over Norway , Denmark , Holland , Belgium and France , and to drive the British armies into the sea at Dunkerque . Unprepared , by the unexpected suddenness of his own triumph , to invade England , he could rest for a while to bask in glory and to gaze on Napoleon 's tomb , dreaming of the day when he would march on Moscow and succeed , through his genius and the irresistible might of tanks and planes , where his Corsican model had failee . After a vain effort to crush the British from the air , but convinced that they had been all but neutralized , he launched his sudden attack on Russia , once more with immense initial success . Though he did not accomplish what he hoped , he accomplished , on the surface , a great deal . He was annoyed , however ? perhaps he was even haunted  --  by the knowledge that the world was somehow convinced , even at the height of his achievements , that he could not finally win . What must be the thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their adventure ? Their armies who marched so confidently into Russia have been nearly bled white ; they have lost their Italian ally ; they have been driven up the Italian peninsula and out of Rome ; they are harassed by guerrillas in Yugoslavia ; their Fortress Europe consists mainly of people who hate them and wait the moment to rise against them ; from the skies death daily pours upon them and levels their cities . And now , at last , the nightmare that has haunted them for years has become a reality . In spite of everything they have done  --  in fact , precisely because of everything they have done  --  they are once more fighting on two fronts . But it is not merely two fronts as in the First World War . They are attacked this time not merely from the east and from the west but from the south . In this three-dimensional war they are attacked from the underground , they are attacked from the skies . What was to have been a march to world conquest and to glory has led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only look into the black abyss and not yet see to the bottom of it .
