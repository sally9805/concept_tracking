Moanin ' Low ( Lena Home ; Victor ; 8 sides ) . Old favorites , such as Stormy Weather , The Man I Love , sung sensationally by the soulful Negro torchsinger , lately of Manhattan 's Caf Society , now in Hollywood . <P> Waller on the Ivories ( Thomas " Fats " Waller ; Victor ; 8 sides ) . First album anthology of Waller 's piano recordings , from Handful of Keys ( 1929 ) to Hoagy Carmichael 's Rockin ' Chair ( 1941 ) . No clowning , no singing , not quite the carefree honky-tonk mood , but high-powered , sure-fingered work . <P> Folk Songs of the U.S.S.R. ( Red Army Chorus . Pyatnitzky Chorus , soloists ; Keynote ; 8 sides ) . Some of the deep feeling , childish simplicity and vein of fatalism of the Russian people shines through these well-chosen songs , which include Stepan Razin , tale of the Slavic Robin Hood . But the recordings , made in the U.S.S.R. , are fuzzily inadequate . <P> Hesitating Blues ( Muggsy Spanier and his Ragtimers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing from an eight-man combination . Spanier , long venerated in the hot-jazz world , lately smashed attendance records at Manhattan 's Arcadia Ballroom , now rates as a name-bander . <P> Moonlight Cocktail ( Glenn Miller ; Bluebird ; Bing Crosby ; Decca ) . Smoothest dance version , best vocal , of the rollingly rhythmic song now at the top in sheet-music sales .
