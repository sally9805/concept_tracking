Edith Kermit Carow , born during the Civil War , was brought up in a brownstone house in New York 's then-fashionable Union Square . Her upbringing was strict . The only suitable entertainments , were symphony concerts , the theater ( if it was Shakespeare ) , and an occasional children 's party , at one of which she met a neighbor , twelve-year-old Theodore Roosevelt . Sixteen years later , they were married in London . Roosevelt was then a widower of three years , his first wife having died soon after the birth of their only child , Alice . <P> A woman with an instinct for privacy , Mrs. Roosevelt reportedly never let her picture appear in a newspaper until her husband was elected Vice President ( although he had previously been New York City Police Commissioner and Governor of New York ) . In the White House , she managed her family and her husband with serene competence and quiet humor . She improved the White House gardens and its housekeeping . Visitors caught glimpses of her reading to her children , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye on Teddy , often interceded at state functions with a quiet " Theodore ! Theodore ! " ( The President always meekly protested : " Why , Edie , I was only- " . ) <P> After her husband 's death in 1919 , she traveled widely . Visiting dignitaries called on her , but she avoided the public eye . She devoted herself to her family and friends , entertained the local Women 's Republican Club , was always ready to help charity drives and benefits for servicemen . Every year on her birthday , the family gathered at her Long Island home , at Oyster Bay . <P> Last week , at 87 , death came to Mrs. Edith Kermit Carow Roosevelt , a great lady .
