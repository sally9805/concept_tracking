South Dakota , home of big open spaces and big open faces , got ready last week for a big , open Senatorial race . All the candidates were outsize . Seventy-three-year-old William J. Bulow , Democrat and present Senator , weighs about 180 lb. and would stand a gnarl-muscled six feet , if he squared his stooped shoulders . Known as a cracker-box humorist and a bull's-eye tobacco spitter , drawling , beaked Bulow won the moniker of " Silent Bill " by speaking on the Senate floor only six times in two terms . He was a pre-war isolationist and " horse-sense " appeaser . He was a sponsor of the illfated , ill-famed Pensions for Congress bill , later weaseled on it . <P> Bulow 's chief worry in the primaries is " Cowboy Tom " Berry , 63 , who is 5 ft. 10 in. without his sombrero , weighs 195 lb . Berry is a friend of Harry Hopkins ; was Governor of the State during the lean years of drought and grasshoppers . Berry has backed much of the New Deal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needling Bulow on his pensions record . <P> Best bet in the Republican Senate race is another big man , cold , close-mouthed Harlan J. Bushfield , 59 , present Governor , who stands a craggy 6 ft. 2 , weighs 195 . Though mum about foreign affairs for the last year , Bushfield dislikes Willkie liberalism , in 1940 aspired to run for Vice President behind Ohio 's Robert A. Taft . Dictator of the machine he built , Bushfield 's main distinction is a record for economy in tax reductions . He might have had a clear field but for the determined person of his Secretary of State , Olive A. Ringsrud . <P> A Willkie-ish liberal , " Olive , " as she is called in South Dakota , measures 5 ft. 10 in stocking feet , weighs a solid 193 lb. , wears a size eleven shoe and seems , they say , " even larger than she is . " With a peaches- &-cream; complexion , a talent for mordant remarks , and a zest for riding the biggest horses available , Olive takes both conservatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Olive 's attack on Bushfield is double-barreled . She pounds away with stories of past investigations of State G.O.P. funds , hammers at a current trial of three of Bushfield 's State officers for embezzlement . Then she attacks his economy record : " He asks for advancement after . . . an administration whose only achievement has been in the field of dollars- &-cents; economy in a world in which the dollar has lost its power to solve the tragic problems of human life . " <P> Almost equidistant between two oceans , South Dakota has long been muffled in the wide spaces of its prairies , now green after the drought years . But today South Dakotans talk of the Battle of Burma , thirst after another raid on faraway Tokyo , seem less interested in the local issues which seem to dominate the campaign . The primary date : May 5.
