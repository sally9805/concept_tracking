At 7 a.m. , reporters of the U.S. and foreign press began gathering sleepily at the State Department . They were handed a little five-page booklet ; the text of the North Atlantic Treaty was top secret no longer . The newsmen had two hours to get their questions ready . On the dot of 9 a.m. , Secretary of State Acheson , the man who had the answers , faced the reporters . <P> Dean Acheson , brown-suited and carefully brushed , let photographers swirl and flash around him . Then for an hour he held forth . Quickly he read through the treaty 's 14 articles . Essentially , the parties to the pact agreed that : <P> They still believed in the United Nations , but were invoking their right under the U.N . charter itself to form a regional defense alliance . <P> They would help themselves and each other to establish armed forces adequate to defend themselves but would " refrain . . . from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the U.N . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them in Europe or North America an attack on all of them . Each nation would determine for itself whether it was necessary to go to war . <P> They would define such an armed attack as an assault in the North Atlantic area on any territory , island possession , aircraft or vessel of any of the signers of the treaty . It would also include any attack on occupation forces in Europe . <P> You Need Latitude . Dean Acheson slipped off his spectacles , was ready for questions . They came fast from all sides . Would an attack on a Berlin airlift plane flying over the Soviet zone be considered an armed attack under the treaty ? Acheson replied calmly that he thought that would be an attack on the occupation forces . " But if it occurs over the Soviet zone ? " the reporter pressed . Acheson said it made no difference . <P> Another newsman asked : " Would aggression against a country , by infiltration within the country , be an armed attack ? " If it were purely an internal revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an armed attack . But if it were a revolution inspired , armed and directed from the outside , that would be a different matter . The pact , he said , did n't spell it out and shouldn't-when you come to real situations you ought to be able to have some latitude in deciding them . <P> Would he " discuss the question of moral obligation to use armed force in resisting attack on one of the members ? " That was the heart of the matter . Hold your hats , the Secretary warned , there 's been a lot of loose thought on the distinction between moral and legal obligation . Decent people usually carry out their contracts because of moral obligation . Some decent people default in their contracts because they get in trouble one way or another , and then they go to court . <P> If There Is Any Doubt . But in a contract between nations , said Acheson , there is no sheriff sitting up in the clouds who is going to come down and see the contract carried out . Nobody could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do what we had contracted to do . If there was an attack , the decisions on what the U.S. would have to do would be made under constitutional procedures .
