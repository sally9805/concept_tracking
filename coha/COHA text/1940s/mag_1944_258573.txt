In Northwestern France , Sergeant Robert Beeton of Clinton , N.C. was tooling along a road in a jeep with two buddies . Among them they had a Tommy gun , two pistols . <P> " We turned a bend , " Beeton said later , " and there , coming down the road , was what looked like an entire company of well-armed krauts . I stopped the jeep and trained the Tommy gun on them . <P> " The German officer shouts to his men : ' Open fire ! ' They opened fire , all right-on him but not on us . Then they surrendered . . . .
