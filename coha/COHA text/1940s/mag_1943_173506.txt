Pan American Airways ' handsome , bemedaled President Juan Terry Trippe smiled handsomely and modestly accepted another gold plaque for his " distinguished contribution to the advancement . . . etc . " It was the 30th annual convention of the National Foreign Trade Council , and the sixth time the Captain Robert Dollar Memorial Award had been handed out . But when Juan Trippe thereupon started talking about " Foreign Trade in the Air Age , " it was real news . After months of heavy silence from Pan Am and frantic speculation by everyone else concerned , Juan Trippe now , for the first time , put Pan Am 's views on international aviation on the record . <P> In sum , Pan Am 's policy was along predicted lines ( TIME , Aug. 23 ) . Trippe 's thesis : Unless the U.S. decides to set up a single " chosen instrument " to compete with the Government-backed monopolies of the rest of the world , the world will outfly the U.S.* What broke new ground in his speech was a refinement of this attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a community company-owned and controlled , not by any one aviation interest , but by all American transportation interests able to contribute , under an organization plan approved by the Government . " Further , it should " not consider the position of any one airline or any group of airlines . " <P> Many U.S. airmen who regard any Pan Am postwar project as a plot to maintain , as far as possible , its prewar monopoly , pondered Juan Trippe 's phrase about " all American transportation interests . " The U.S. air is already thunderous with rumors that Pan Am has been trying to freeze out other airlines by making a separate postwar peace with the railroads-which are now barred by law from flying . But Trippe 's second point seemed to undercut suspicions about his first , for he had now said that the chosen instrument should be much bigger than Pan Am . <P> * Ten possible competitors for the postwar air enumerated by Trippe : KLM ( Dutch ) , BOAC ( British ) , Soviet Air Trust , Air France , SILA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lufthansa ( German ) , LATI ( Italian ) , Dai Nippon ( Japan ) .
