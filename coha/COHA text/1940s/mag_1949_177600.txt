Emmett Gary Middlecoff , the golfing dentist from Memphis , sank his final putt for a 286 and began his deathwatch . In the pressroom at Medinah Country Club , 23 miles from Chicago , he dragged alternately at a cigarette and two double-Bourbons with Coke . His wife , Edith , was weeping with excitement , and a friend was prematurely pounding him on the back and burbling , " Boy , you 're the champ . . . what a homecoming Memphis will put on for you . " Reporters were dispassionately batting out new leads about the biggest golf tournament of them all-the U.S. Open . <P> It was not over yet . Still out on Medinah 's tough , narrow-waisted fairways , and needing only even pars to tie Middlecoff was Sam Snead . The grapevine buzzed that Snead was hot . " He 's burning up that last nine , " snapped Middlecoff nervously . " I 'm betting I wo n't win . I 'll bet you $10 right now that Snead ties me or beats me . " Somebody took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infamous xyth-balding , slope-shouldered Sam Snead stood on the elevated tee and squinted at the postage stamp green 193 yards away . Snead 's tee shot was long , landed in inch-high grass on the apron . It was a simple chip shot , but Sam reached instead for the borrowed putter that had revitalized his game ( TIME , June 13 ) . <P> That time it was the wrong club . He banged the ball eight feet beyond the hole , missed the putt coming back for a one-over-par four . When Sam got no better than par on the 18th , he gave a horde of newsmen one glum look : " It was that damned seventeenth that did it . " Gary Middlecoff just grinned and paid off his $10 hedge-bet . With a $2,000 first prize and the prestige that goes with being U.S. Open golf champion , he could well afford it . Snead had tied for second place with North Carolinian Clayton Heafner at 287 . <P> It had been a topsy-turvy tournament , played over a killing course in heat up to 96 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson ) could not place among the first 51 at the halfway point and were eliminated . So was Jimmy Demaret , usually one of big-league golf 's deadliest men . Middlecoff 's winning 286 was two strokes over par , a rarity in this par-smashing age . The tall ( 6 ft. 2 in. , 180 lb . ) Tennessean pro , who looks a little ' like Baseballer Ted Williams , had won by playing safe ; he was in the rough off the tee only four times in 72 holes .
