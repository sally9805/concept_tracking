txt The stucco gambling house atop the Palisades that Jersey justice could not find yesterday , although its fame had led New York City police and Office of Price Administration agents to halt its rented limousines , was locked last night for the first time in the recent memory of residents of the neighboring small homes . The dice and card games , it developed , had moved to Fairview , four miles away , just in case the local heat should be turned on . Four private cars were shuttling players from the Bridge Plaza at Fort Lee to the new stand . Although reporters visited the Barn , as the Fort Lee place was widely known , and examined the criss-cross of tire treads still fresd in its large parking space from the previous night 's limousines , New Jersey police insisted , with the crestfallen appearance of a dice player who has just muffed his point , that they knew of no such gambling house . Chief of Police Andrew of Fort Lee , within whose precincts the house with the blackpainted windows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never heard of any gambling in the entire borough nor had any of his policemen ever reported any . " I would like to know where this place is , so I can raid it , " said Chief , when he was asked about the gambling house . " We have had no complaints of gambling for more than a year . Our men are out all the time . We have found nothing unusual of any kind in. the borough . " Later in the day , after reporters // NEW JERSEY POLICE CA N'T FIND CASINO // had located the casino in Fort Lee , to which neighbors said limousines brought the gamesters nightly , Chief was not reached ' for further comment . Bergen County Prosecutor John ' J. Breslin , who sent ? two members of his staff across the Hudson after reading the newspapers , to ask Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine for information about New Jersey gambling , said last night he still did not know where the gambling place was . A reporter drove to the seemingly deserted barn shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to a halt in the otherwise empty parking space than a figure detached itself from the shadows of a doorway and came over . " No game tonight ? " asked the reporter . ' We moved down to Fairview ; had to , " was the reply . The man in the shadows mentioned the name of a place in Fairview , and added : " I 'll have one of the luggers drive you down . " We 've got luggers on the Bridge Plaza . " The luggers were in plain evidence at the plaza . With a flamboyant disdain for local police regulations , their cars were lined up at the approach to the George Washington Bridge  --  along a curb where parking is prohibited . There was nothing secretive about their operations . Players found them readily , and as each car filled up it lugged its load southward and returned to pick up fresh arrivals . Commissioner Valentine said his department was making available to Mr. Breslin all information that might help him , and Mr. Breslin said he would be glad to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York police . One of Prosecutor Breslin 's emissaries , Henry B. Lockwood , chief of Bergen County detectives , said  --  after he got back to New Jersey  --  that " New York bungled the affair " by giving publicity to the gambling before Jersey justice was ready to move . Neighbors of the gambling casino told reporters yesterday that the place , and others in Northern New Jersey that anyone with a few dollars in his pockets could readily find had been operating since long before gasoline rationing was ordered . " Now if we make a raid , " said Chief Lockwood , " there is no chance of finding any gambling equipment . " Limousine Owners Face Penalties Meanwhile , the eight limousine operators whose vehicles had been stopped by New York police and OPA agents shortly before midnight Thursday as they rolled off this end of the George Washington Bridge with their cargoes of admitted dice-rollers faced reduction or cancellation of their gasoline rations by the Office of Defense Transportation . A spokesman for the OPA , who said that agency had been represented in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested , declared the complaints of use of gasoline for non-essential purposes against the rental cars were being sent to ODT . G. W. Anderson , regional ODT manager of local transport , said that the gasoline rations would be reduced or cancelled if it was found that the limousines had used gasoline unnecessarily . He said , however , that the wartime agency had no interest in the " moral aspects " of driving to a gambling house . It was just as wasteful of gasoline for a business man to drive home from his office in a rental car or for a woman to make a social call by taxicab when the trip could be made by subway or bus , Mr. Anderson said . Residents Mildly Surprised The failure of the Bergen County authorities to find the gambling ' house evoked mild surprise on the part of many North Jersey citizens , who said there were so many gambling houses in those parts that the law officials could hardly avoid stumbling on one or another even if it was n't the one to which the limousines had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fogginess persisted despite the fact that a New York City plainclothes policeman had made four visits to the gambling place before the trap was laid for the limousines . His first explanation , after his two men returned from New York Police Headquarters , was that the New York City policeman had said he himself would no longer be able to find or identify the place . This , said Mr. Breslin , had been reported to him by Chief Lockwood . Last night Mr. Breslin said that , on the basis of additional information from Chief Lockwood , he wished to correct his original explanation . He said the New York police had given Lockwood an address-23 Third Street  --  as the location of the gambling house and that there was no such address in Fort Lee . This was after a reporter had given Chief Lockwood the location of the Barn and had asked him whether it would operate last night . The Chief had said he did n't think any gambling house would open its doors . Prosecutor Breslin 's emissaries delivered to Commissioner Valentine a letter requesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then conferred with Deputy Chief Inspector Michael J. Murphy and with Sgt. Walter Clerke of the Headquarters Confidential Squad , who had investigated the limousine shuttle service . Mr. Breslin said last night that he would await arrival of a detailed written report from Inspector Murphy , which he expected today , before making any further move . He said he would invite the New York policeman who had visited the gambling house to ride around the county with Chief Lockwood , in the hope of having him find the place . There were reports yesterday that the Fort Lee casino 's nightly play of $25,000 to $50,000 in dice and card games was only an extension of afternoon activities , which consisted of large-scale betting on horse races . Mr. Breslin recalled that he had called in all the police chiefs in Bergen County , including Chief , about a month ago to ask them to be on the alert for gambling houses , and that none of them at that time reported any gambling resorts in their precincts .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
