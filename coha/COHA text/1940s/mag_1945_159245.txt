From the Department of Agriculture came a report which would make wistful and incredible reading for Europe 's starving millions ( see above ) . The U.S. , its farms untouched by the war , was still a cornucopia land : in 1946 its citizens would probably eat better than ever be fore in their history of plenty . <P> There was nothing but good to report of the U.S. larder . " Plentiful supplies of most foods are in prospect . . . . More ice cream , cheese , condensed and evaporated milk , fluid cream , canned vegetables and fresh and frozen fish will be available . . . . Eggs and fluid milk will continue plentiful . . . . Chicken , turkey , fresh fruits and vegetables , frozen and dried fruits , potatoes and sweet potatoes and cereal products will continue substantially the same . . . . Supplies of some meats and fats ( other than butter ) will be larger than before the war . . . . Sugar supplies should improve . . . . " <P> The average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year , will probably get even mere than in 1944 , when he ate a record 11% above the level of prewar years . The only remaining shortages will be in pork , high-grade beef , butter , sugar and canned fish-where there will not be enough to satisfy the demand at present price and prosperity levels . And even these shortages are more apparent than real . The average consumption of meat next year will be 145-155 pounds ; the record for the last 30 years was 150 pounds .
