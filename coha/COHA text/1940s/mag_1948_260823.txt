Who but the neighbors cared about what passed in the house of the widow Lehrte ? So unquiet were the times , and so jumpy the world , that Frau Lehrte and a young soldier out for an afternoon of fun last Week caused an excited incident in besieged Berlin . Some U.S. newspapers reported it under black headlines . Said one story : " Russian troops have opened fire inside the U.S. sector . " <P> For some time , the neighbors had been indignant over Frau Lehrte 's activities . She lived in the southernmost part of Berlin 's U.S. sector , on Landshuterstrasse , a pleasant street which runs across the fateful boundary between Berlin and the surrounding Soviet zone . Lately an increasing number of Russian officers had walked over the boundary to visit the widow Lehrte . <P> One afternoon last week , a Russian lieutenant , a rifle slung over his shoulder . drove a motorcycle up the street . He was young , short and fairly handsome except for two scars , one on each side of his face , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet . Dozens of eyes peering through curtained windows saw the Russian walk unsteadily up the steps and enter Frau Lehrte 's house . Soon he walked down the steps and into a nearby orchard , where he leaned wearily against an apple tree : the widow Lehrte was not home , and the Russian intended to wait for her return . <P> Then a German police car and a U.S. MP jeep arrived ( they had been summoned by an indignant neighbor who had finally decided to inform the authorities of the goings-on at Frau Lehrte 's ) . The Russian jerked himself erect . Forgetting his motorcycle , he walked off in the direction of the Soviet zone . But when he saw a second U.S. jeep pull up , he ducked behind a tree , raised his rifle and fired four quick shots . German and U.S. police flung themselves behind the parked cars ; the Russian slipped away . A German policeman , wounded in the leg , lay on his back before Frau Lehrte 's house . Germans clustered around him and stared at the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this moment , Frau Lehrte returned . She was a handsome woman of about 40 , with a broad peasant face . She hurried up the street , glancing apprehensively at the crowd before her house . None of the neighbors spoke to her . Edward A. Morrow of the New York Times , who happened to be on the scene , walked up to her and asked : " Were you expecting a Russian officer ? " <P> " I suppose so , " she answered . " I know some Russians . He might have been a friend of some of them . " Then she hurried into her house . <P> " Here he comes again ! " Children who had been playing down the street raised the cry . " Here he comes again ! " The Russian lieutenant reappeared . He saw the Americans gathered near his motorcycle , and slipped back out of sight . One block away , in a tree-lined sidestreet , Morrow caught up with him . The lieutenant was now accompanied by a Russian private , whose Tommy gun he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian understood ) : " I am unarmed . I want to find out what 's happening here . " <P> Struggling to maintain the composure befitting an officer , the lieutenant said , " I want my motorcycle back . " <P> " What motorcycle ? " <P> " No joking ! " said the Russian . " All I want is my motorcycle . " <P> " Why did you fire at the police ? " Morrow asked .
