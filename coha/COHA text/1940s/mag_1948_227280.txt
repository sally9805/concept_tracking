When the flossy fashion-trade magazine Kaleidoscope made its bow this fall , magazine men were amazed at the jet-propelled speed with which it had been put together ( TIME , Sept. 13 ) . Last week , Kaleidoscope set another speed record of sorts : after only three issues , it fizzled out like a spent rocket . On Thanksgiving eve dismissal notices went to the staff . <P> In its short life , the monthly had burned up $800,000 invested by Backers Harold Talbott , Jack Chrysler , Angier Biddle Duke , Joe Uihlein Jr . ( Schlitzbeer ) and others . To keep going , Kaleidoscope needed another $1,400,000 , and nobody wanted to risk that much . Explained Publisher William Husted : " There 's a falling market in the fashion industry right now ... and we just did n't get enough advertising . " ( From 172 pages of ads in October , sales had dropped to 56 in November , only 22 in December . ) <P> Editor Martha Stout had a different reason . " None of those boys knew a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pretty tough these days even for publishers who know what they 're doing . " <P> Adman Arthur Collins , who had founded Kaleidoscope and was squeezed out of it three weeks after the first issue appeared , agreed with Editor Stout . " The sole cause of their failure was their management , or lack of it , " said he . " It was sure what one magazine called it-a ' 90Day Wonder . "
