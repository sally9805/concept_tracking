To ease the tremendous strain of food demands on the U.S. , Secretary of Agriculture Clinton P. Anderson last week came up with an idea : foreign countries should place their food orders well before crops are planted so that production rather than prices will be stimulated . And the U.S. , in turn , should place its orders for food in foreign countries in advance of planting time . <P> At first hearing , this sounded plausible and easy to do . But it was only the semantic sugar on the pill of Anderson 's program for " spreading the risk of world recovery . " The pill was disclosed a few days later in his testimony before Congress ' Joint Committee on the Economic Report . Anderson asked for authority to supply foreign nations with machinery , fertilizer , information , etc . More important , he wanted the scope of the Government 's Commodity Credit Corp . enlarged so that it could finance the planting , growing and harvesting of crops and enter into contracts to purchase crops at mutually agreed prices . <P> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support program for farm prices around the globe . It was convinced that the U.S. , which supplied 52.4% of world grain exports in the last crop year , must be a big supplier of food to the rest of the world for a long time . Government officials think it would be safer-in case of a U.S. crop failure-and cheaper to draw other nations into the food pool , even though their crops must be supported by U.S. purchases . How much would this cost ? Star-gazing Mr. Anderson did not say , but the U.S. support programs cost the Government nearly $800 million last year . <P> During the war , CCC had used its funds for such foreign food purchases under a 1942 directive of President Roosevelt . But with the war over , CCC officials have been wary of doing so without a specific directive from Congress . Whether Congress would pass such a program depends on how bad the world food shortage becomes .
