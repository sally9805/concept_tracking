In spite of the New Deal , in spite of the all-powerful political boss who is their mayor , Chicago 's traction system will still be visited on the children of Chicagoans , even to the second and third generations . That was the news that depressed Chicagoans last week . <P> Their elevated , emanating from the famed " Loop " around Chicago 's business center , was built for a city of 1,700,000 ( present pop . 3,400,000 ) , is now in receivership . Its last big purchase of new equipment was made just before the U.S. entered World War I. Their streetcars , owned by four different companies ( all in receivership ) and operated by a fifth , are oldfashioned , high-riding trolleys ( " antediluvian arks " ) , 75% of which were built before Harding campaigned on his front porch . And they are so crowded that many Chicagoans can not even reach a strap to hang on to . <P> When Mayor Ed Kelly wangled an $18,000,000 PWA appropriation in 1938 to help build a subway , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His City Council passed a unification plan , voters adopted it 10-to-1 in a referendum . All bondholders approved the plan ; so did the Federal Court which handles the receivership proceedings . <P> But the plan ran into a new stumbling block : after a year of listening to arguments , the Illinois Commerce Commission rejected the plan as financially " unsound " and containing insufficient guarantee of improved service . <P> Chicago 's newspapers ( except the Tribune ) pointed out that the State Commission was appointed by Republican Governor Dwight H. Green , who might conceivably hate to see Democrat Ed Kelly get credit for untangling the transit tangle . Mayor Kelly shouted : " An outrage . . . . " But the Commission 's decision was final . <P> The only immediate loophole was suggested last week by a city attorney : perhaps , since all the lines were in receivership in Federal Court , the State Commission had no jurisdiction . The receivership judge , Michael L. Igoe , clutched at this straw . Said he : " If the Commerce Commission has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one will be happier than this Court . " <P> But it appeared that the attorneys , who argued before the State Commission for a year without questioning its jurisdiction , would have a hard time making a case . Said the Chicago Sun : " The net result ... is to leave Chicago 's traction muddle exactly where it was when the fight for unification started 15 years ago , except that it costs more ( 8 instead of 5 ) to ride the streetcars now . "
