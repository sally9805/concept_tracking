txt Nearly seventy years have gone by since the Third Republic was born in the agony and bitterness of French defeat It conquered disunity , it survived scandal , it lived on through three generations of peaceful achievement and military glory . Now , in another defeat , the curtain has fallen . Already the Third Republic is being called " the old regime . " For , whether or not French resistance continues sporadically on the sea or overseas , the scene will be changed when the curtain rises again . If Germany finally dominates Europe , there can be no Republique Frangaise except an aching memory and a deathless hope ; and if independent France can be re-established , through British resistance , and German downfall , there will be a new start , perhaps a Fourth Republic , conceivably an Anglo-French union of the sort which was offered by the British last week , in a gesture that may yet become a landmark in human progress . The French people can have plenty of cause for pride as they look back over the great events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a cast of characters walked their stage ! They will always be proud of Gambetta , with his flaming eloquence and his spirit of steel , the organizer of resistance in those other dark days when the French spirit was close to breaking . They will always be grateful to Thiers , the little civilian in the frock coat who was worth a dozen marshals of France , and to Jules Ferry , who gave France free education , social reform and a new empire . They will never forget Clemenceau , who led them to their greatest victory , or Briand , who gave them a glimpse of the Promised Land of peace , who said that " at Locarno we spoke European , a new language we ought certainly to learn . " But there were other , less successful , leaders whose ghosts come crowding back in this hour of disillusion : Boulanger , the queer Man on Horseback , who came so close to becoming a dictator ; and the intriguers who banished Dreyfus to Devil 's Island , and the defeatists Caillaux and Malvy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyranny and will be used now as tyranny 's puppets . And behind these , in the corridors of seventy years , there stood a mass of mediocrities , a procession of politicians whose very names have been forgotten in the rush of events that were too great for them . The inner collapse that struck France this month was not solely the result of recent errors , not wholly the work of inadequate leadership . It was , to a large extent , a product of faults in the structure of the Third Republic itself . " Of all forms of government it divided France the least , " wrote one English critic who tried to explain the Republic to his countrymen . This was a negative virtue that enabled the Republic to withstand its first shocks and endure for seventy years , but it was also the source of continual weakness . Because post-Napoleonic France was terrified of adventurers , the builders of the Third Republic took good care to make sudden popular plebiscites impossible . For this reason they made it impossible for French Presidents to dissolve Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reason , in turn , little-groups otpoliticians jockeyed constantly for the balance of power . Cabinets were always at the mercy of Parliament , and changes of Government took place so often that foreigners found it difficult to ' follow them . There were times during those seventy years when exceptional French Premiers were able to do heroic and enduring work ; but there were other times of crisis  --  such as the week of Hitler 's advent to power in 1933 , or the fateful reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936 ? when Cabinet crises paralyzed the will of France just when it needed to function with all its strength . The essential weakness of the Third Republic lay in its political machinery . But France herself is not to be judged by that political machinery . Within the framework of the Third Republic ? and it was nothing more than a frame , a stage setting  --  there lived and flourished a civilization so brilliant , so humane , so gracious and beautiful , that mankind will be in its debt forever . The political leaders , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third Republic years . When free men look back upon this Republic they will remember , instead , the artists and thinkers , the poets and musicians and scientists who made France during those years a temple of the Western spirit . The French mind that gave an Anatole Franca or a Pasteur to the world can not be warped permanently by foreign conquerors ; the French valor that could not be broken by tanks and bombing planes will not be crushed by any efforts of the Gestapo ; the French peasant who kept his sanity and courage for so many generations will not lose his love of the land , his love of France and freedom . If only a tithe of the French genius is applied to the art of government in future years , there can be no doubt that the French people will prove worthy of their opportunity and their duty . They will build something stronger and sounder than the Third Republic when they have another chance to refashion their freedom .               @ @ @ @ @ @
