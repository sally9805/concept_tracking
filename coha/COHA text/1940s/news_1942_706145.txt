txt Food for Morale The Department of Agriculture , Sea . retary Claude Wickard and other government officials tell us that in this country " mountains of food are avail , able . " If this be true , it is timely to ask what is now being done to bring these supplies to the American people. , especially to the 33 per cent who are undernourished ? On this important point the Administration is silent , and Congress seems intent on voting against the appropriations for food stamps , thus cutting off the channel through which the food mountains could be moved toward millions of hungry mouths . We are supposed to feed Great Britain , China , etc. , on the ground that they are fighting for us . Now that the United States is fighting for them  --  and for ourselves , incidentally  --  it would seem essential to bolster up the morale of our citizenry with hearty meals . Or is it better to let them suffer and feed . them chiefly with patriotic orations ? MARY WINS0a . New York . Jan. 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
