The Story of Mary Surratt ( by John Patrick ; produced by Russell Lewis &; Howard Young ) is not too widely known , considering its connection with the most famous murder in U.S. history . Mrs. Surratt 's Washington boardinghouse was the meeting place for John Wilkes Booth and his fellow conspirators ( one of whom was her son ) . After Lincoln 's assassination , the widow Surratt was among those tried before a military commission and hanged . <P> There is still some doubt that she was involved in the conspiracy . Her trial , in any case , was highly irregular . Defense counsel ( Senator Reverdy Johnson , played by Kent Smith as an early Maryland beau of Mary 's ) was insulted , witnesses were intimidated , Government-held evidence was deliberately suppressed . <P> Playwright Patrick ( The Hasty Heart ) is in no doubt whatever : he insists that Mary Surratt was innocent . He virtually insists , as well , that she was framed . The vindictive , unjudicial spirit in which she was tried serves Playwright Patrick , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Mary Surratt 's story allows for a much stronger protest than it does for a play . As a piece of half-forgotten history , the play has a factual interest , if not complete factual accuracy ; and a good deal of the trial has dramatic force . Mary Surratt herself ( well acted by Dorothy Gish ) is portrayed as a very human woman . But the play as a whole is by no means dramatic . Intense partisanship has robbed the play of all psychological suspense : the audience has no opportunity to play either detective or judge . <P> <P> John Loves Mary ( by Norman Krasna ; produced by Richard Rodgers &; Oscar Hammerstein II , in association with Joshua Logan ) is just one of those things , dubbed good popular entertainment , that frequently run for a year . As in his Dear Ruth ( which ran even longer and will soon reappear as a movie ) , Playwright Krasna has worked up a farcical facer in the way of plot , peppered the goings-on liberally with gags , and relied on youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staging brisk . About all that a captious customer can complain of : John Loves Mary seems worked by a crank , is too predictable , too protracted , not notably funny . <P> John loves Mary and has come back from war to marry her . But , oh , the complications ! John 's pal Fred has come home earlier minus the English girl he loved . John , like a true pal , has married the girl to get her into the U.S. The idea , of course , is that she will immediately divorce John and marry Fred . But Fred has already got himself married to another , and is to become a father at any moment . This pretty how-de-do becomes even prettier when John and Fred try to hide the facts from Mary and her hard-bitten U.S. Senator of a father . Complications and crises abound , for Playwright Krasna is a bear for plot , and he hangs on to one for dear life . Parts of the play are fun , bits of it are funny , but most of it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom Ewell as Fred , and Loring Smith as the Senator give it something extra . The role of the unwanted English bride is the stage debut of Pamela Gordon , 28-year-old daughter of Actress Gertrude Lawrence .
