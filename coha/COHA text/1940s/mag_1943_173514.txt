THE DUKE : BEING AN ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE &; ACHIEVEMENTS OF ARTHUR WELLESLEY , 1st DUKE OF WELLINGTON - Richard Aldington-Viking ( $3.75 ) . <P> Among his other achievements the Duke of Wellington discovered the most astonishing thing in the world : its lack of common sense . Studying the battles of England from India to Copenhagen , and leading the armies in the ones that England won , he was all the more aware of that lack of common sense for a reason that neither his friends , his enemies , nor he himself observed : in the days of Napoleon he had almost a world monopoly of it . <P> The Duke is a tribute . The 29th book of Richard Aldington , 51 , and his best , it is to the vast library of material on Wellington what Reader 's Digest is to the accumulation of writing in U.S. magazines - an expert job of condensation and synthesis , inspired when its source materials are inspired , slowgoing when the mass of detail is incorporated at the expense of color and warmth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple man who did not know that what he said was wisdom . <P> A Living Force . Its double value to U.S. readers is that it simultaneously introduces them to the best British general and to a body of literature they have largely neglected : the spirited , emotional , uneven , intense and practically useful compositions of military men . Its distinction is that it makes common sense not a mere negative quality - the avoidance of mistakes - but a pulsing , living force , strange as genius and more understandable ; unbeatable , kindly , unexpected , confident , and as essential to the winning of a world war as it is to organizing a practical world peace . <P> The Duke of Wellington did both . When he returned to England after beating Napoleon 's marshals in Spain , Englishmen made the dusty turnpike road from Dover to London " one long roaring cheer . " He rode unmoved , and apparently unhearing , through 60 solid miles of praise . He believed that if you ignored the fickle crowd 's catcalls you should also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had had to ignore its criticisms . Not many years later he was the most unpopular man in England . Once a huge mob stormed his mansion and smashed every window while the Duke sat inside beside the dead body of his wife . Once he made his way home from the Tower of London through howling crowds . He remained almost as expressionless through five miles of hostility as he had been through 60 miles of cheers . The difference was that he touched his hat to a hero named Martin Tupper who shouted , " Waterloo ! Waterloo ! " It was the 17th anniversary of the day Wellington and Blcher led the armies that saved the Empire , Europe , and the civilization that flowered in the long Victorian peace .
