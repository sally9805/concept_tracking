txt The men who keep America 's freight trains rolling are dreaming fresh dreams of box cars in the sky . And their whetted interest in flying freight marks the dawn of an era when more than ever before the things you use will be sped to you through the clouds . Thus far the government has excluded railroad operators from running scheduled air lines of any sort . Train men have protested ; they 've been rebuffed , but are still pressing the fight . Evidence of their interest is reflected in two bills ( H.R .. 3317 and H.R .. 3835 ) now before Congress . Offered as amendments to the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 , the bills would open the way for railroads ( and steamship operators ) to cut themselves a piece of the freight-by-air pie . Today the emphasis is all on freight ; several years ago , the railroads tried to get regular passenger-mail-freight carrying certificates , but did n't get far with the . arripaign .

And its Santa Fe Skyways already carries freight on a " contract " basis . This " contract " type service ( as distinguished from regular , scheduled service open to all shippers ) is not now barred to the railroads . No other rail carrier is openly pressing for permission to operate a scheduled cargo line , although there may be some rail applications hidden among the hundreds on file with the Call Aeronautics Board . But trainmen 's talk points to the Boston ( 9 , Maine , the Kansas City Southern and the Baltimore &; Ohio as eyeing the field with special interest . And back of this interest is solid evidence to suggest that the train men are n't bestirring themselves for nothing . Flying freight is coming of age .

The passenger traffic , after a rocket-like spurt from the pre-war volume , leveled ott late last year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargo ; it 's soared 100% above a year ago . Moreover , say the experts , it 's going to keep on soaring . Right now , measured in ton miles . it is still less than one-fifth of air passenger volume  --  counting each passenger and his luggage at 200 pounds . But a key executive with one of the nation 's big airlines says bluntly : " I look for cargo business to equal or exceed passenger traffic in five years or so . " That would be a gain of at least 400% in the next half decade . And it 's not the most optimistic piecliction you can hear . Some air men say confidently that air cargo volume will jump 1.000,1 , by the mid-1950s . The Normal Pattern Transporation men reason this way .

Of course a prime factor in any transportation is cost This has been a big handicap to air cargo , but the handicap is being rapidly whittled down . While rail express rates have risen as much as 35% ( including a new boost due in about 10 days ) from late 1946. air cargo rates have taken a sharp tumble . For example , a plane load lot from New York to Chicago would command today a rock-bottom level of 111/2 cents a ton mile , about 3% under the corresponding rail express rate . The latter . however , includes door-to-door delivery , while most air cargo shipments are quoted airport-to-airport . Air cargo rates average about 123 ... cents a ton mile , although some small shipments may command as much as 18 cents . Rail express rates are on a sliding scale . with longer distances cheaper than short ones . In many cases , door-to-door delivery is actually cheaper by air cargo than by rail express . A big New York dressmaker , shipping in quantity , can whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , for 5 2 cents . It costs him 5.3 cents to send it by rail express . Air Express Rates Higher Air cargo rates are not as high as air express rates . Ordinarily used for shipments of smaller bulk , air express items get more expeditious handling , and they are also picked up and delivered by the Railway Express Agency . Air express costs the shipper about 45 cents a ton mile . Even so , it is actually cheaper in a few cases to ship by air express than by rail express . Between New York City and Albany . N. Y .. a distance of 149 miles , delivery of a 32-pound shipment by air express costs only $1 , whereas by rail express it costs $1.42 .
