When the wind is right , Herman Stiglmeier and Henry Myers get restless . They are twin brothers* with a twin ambition - to fly a glider longer than anyone else has . <P> On a blustery morning last week , they piled oranges , raisins , coffee into their two-place glider and took off , towed by a 1942 Chevrolet until their glider was 100 feet in the air . All day they swooped , soared and whirled above the hills of Palos Verdes , Calif , and out over the Pacific Ocean . <P> Sometimes they fell to a dangerous 200 ft. , sometimes they soared as high as 6,000 ft . Once they nearly crashed . When darkness fell , they watched for flashlight signals on the ground . <P> Finally , at 9:45 , the twins flashed the ground nine times to announce that they were going to land . Said Herman , " It was n't very healthy up there in the dark in something that did n't have a motor in it . " The brothers put their plane into a dive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take-off - they glided to a landing . They had topped the American duration record by nearly three hours . <P> Other winners last week : <P> Walter Piekarski , a Chicago high-school boy , scored 91 points in one basketball game . <P> Promoter Sol Strauss won a victory of sorts . Jersey Joe Walcott reluctantly signed on Sol 's terms ( 20% of the net gate , radio and television returns , 22% of the movie rights ) instead of his own ( 30% ) for a return bout with Joe Louis at Yankee Stadium on June 23 . <P> Iron-grey , Argentine-bred Talon charged from last place to first to nose out On Trust in California 's $102,500 Santa An ita Handicap , the world 's richest race . In Florida 's Flamingo Stakes , the horse that is supposed to have the inside track on the 1948 Kentucky Derby - Citation - romped home by six lengths in near track-record time to win $43,500 . <P> <P> * Henry simplified his name .                @ @ @ @ @
