Four utility companies serving Chicago and northern Illinois have offered to cut their rates by this amount as a result of a recent slash in charges they pay pipe line companies for natural gas , a component of the gas served to consumers . This was confirmed last night by members of the commission in Springfield , who said the new rate schedules are being worked out and will be placed in force soon . Four Companies Involved . Besides Peoples Gas , the companies involved and the yearly rate cuts they have offered to make are : Public Service Company of Northern Illinois , $735,000 ; Western United Gas and Electric company , $295,000 , and Illinois Northern Utilities company , $31,000 . Peoples Gas serves 800,000 customers in Chicago . The other three companies serve more than 200,000 gas customers outside the city .

The refunds will be made because the pipe line reduction was made retroactive to Sept. 1 , 1940.
