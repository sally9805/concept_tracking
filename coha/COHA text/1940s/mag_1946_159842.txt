THE AMERICAN ( 337 pp. ) - Howard Fast-Duell , Sloan &; Pearce ( $3 ) . <P> " Sleep softly . . . eagle forgotten , " wrote one Illinois poet , Vachel Lindsay . " The only governor of Illinois sure to be named by remote generations , " wrote another , Carl Sandburg . Ex-Secretary of War Newton D. Baker thought him " a genuinely great man " ; so did Brand Whitlock , onetime U.S. Ambassador to Belgium ; so did , and do , numberless others . The latest to unearth and praise the forgotten eagle is able , young ( 32 ) , leftist Novelist Howard Fast ( The Last Frontier , The Unvanquished , a New Masses assistant editor ) . Fast retells the John Peter Altgeld story in a fictionalized biography : The American , A Middle Western Legend . <P> Fictionalized biography is at best a bastard literary form , at worst as silly and hoked-up as , say , U.S. cinema 's recent contribution to the biography of Frederic Chopin , A Song to Remember . The American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the acute schizophrenia common to all work of its kind . The biographical and historical detail limit its interest as story . The choice of facts and the touches of literary fancy work limit its value as biography . Novelist Fast knows facts when he sees them , treats them respectfully , arrays most of those relating to Altgeld 's career in good order . But he adds dabs of " color , " invents dialogue ( " Dear . . . do you want eggs or hot cakes ? " " I want hot cakes " ) , even pretends to plumb Altgeld 's mind and explain his motives . Harry Barnard 's biography , Eagle Forgotten ( 1938 ) , remains by far the best and fullest account of Altgeld 's life . The American contributes " interpretive " moments and prose passages that sound like Upton Sinclair . <P> Millionaire " Socialist . " Altgeld 's bravest , best-known act as governor of Illinois was his pardon , in 1893 , of three labor leaders jailed for complicity in Chicago 's Haymarket bombing seven years earlier. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Socialist , " a " wild-haired demagogue . " Robert Todd Lincoln , President Lincoln 's only surviving son , rose at a Harvard alumni banquet to beg all good Harvard men to " stand firm in the midst of such dangers in the republic . " The press screamed that the Governor was encouraging " anarchy , rapine and the overthrow of civilization . " <P> The truth is , as Novelist Fast points out , that the prisoners had almost certainly been railroaded to jail for political purposes , and that the Governor himself was not trying to overthrow civilization . He was a self-made Gilded Age millionaire lawyer of German peasant stock who happened to develop a social conscience . Personally he had little to gain by the pardon and much to lose ; in fact , he lost the governorship at the next election , and later could not even get elected Mayor of Chicago . He died a relatively poor man at a relatively early age ( 55 ) in 1902 , of locomotor ataxia . He was mourned by thousands , among them Poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as governor in Springfield : <P> Where is Altgeld , brave as the truth , <P> Whose name the few still say with tears ? <P> Gone to join the ironies with Old John Brown , <P> Whose fame rings loud for a thousand years. * <P>
