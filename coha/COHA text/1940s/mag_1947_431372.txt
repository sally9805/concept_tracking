You ca n't go on forever taking soda and munching soda mints . Finally you go to the doctor . Your doctor gets a complete history of your condition , makes a thorough examination , takes some X-rays . Your symptoms are classic ulcer symptoms , but such a stomachache may indicate also one of several disturbances , such as hernia , gallstones , and even simple indigestion . The diagnosis is neither easy nor casual . Finally your doctor diagnoses ulcer in the duodenum . You ask anxiously , " Is it a peptic ulcer , doctor ? " " Peptic ulcer " is an all-inclusive term used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Peptic " comes from " pepsin , " an enzyme that digests food . There are many kinds of ulcer , and they may appear over a large area ; but the common ones in the duodenum , the first part of the small intest True stomach ulcer is known as a " gastric ulcer , " this ma ? , if untreated , become malignant . The denal ulcer is almost always benign . The duodenui lined with mucous membrane . When a break does not heal promptly occurs in this membrane , have an ulcer . Men suffer from ulcers more often than women c by a ratio of 8 to I. Ulcers develop in young peop usually between 18 and 40 , who otherwise seem to healthy . Nobody knows what causes ulcers ; but generally has been noticed that intelligent , drivii highly strung , conscientious , rarely neurotic , and f quently very capable people are the ones who suf from them .

Ulcers seem to be worse in the spring and f . Why ? Nobody knows . Maybe because you often  | emotional in the spring and get the sniffles with , the =-st frost . When your doctor says you have an ulcer , you ust face the fact that this is essentially a chronic , recurring trouble . If you are careless about it , it ' wo n't be likely to kill you , but it can make your life a nightmare . Treatment will give you relief . Your al , er will heal . But if you decide that all is well and aobey your doctor , or if you permit circumstances upset your equilibrium , you 'll probably have the rnle trouble again . Your condition may so improve that you can do rid eat many things you could not tolerate before ; ut your ulcer may recur . Let us , therefore , understand the treatment : You may have heard a great deal about miraculous : orations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall see . However , at least 80 percent i all ulcers can be cared for without surgery . On the other hand , ulcers can not be controlled by diet alone . Diet is an extremely important factor , but it is only one factor . According to one doctor , " Anyone who fails to take a fundamental interest in the individual ith an ulcer as a psychological and physiological entity fails miserably in visualizing the problem and controlling it . " For this reason , at one great hospital there is a team for the care of ulcer patients , composed of a physician , a surgeon , a psychiatrist , a trained social-service worker , and a dietitian . Your own doctor is obliged to combine the functions of these experts . It is important to understand this , and to cooperate with him . He can cope with your condition if you help him . First comes . your diet . It will consist of very simple , bland foods , such as milk , cream , cereals , eggs , and custards at first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to forget much red meat and fried and highly spiced foods . You may complain , but surely your greatest pleasure in life does n't depend on lobster Newburg or porterhouse steak and French fries ! Regularity is extremely important . You must eat frequently , at stated intervals , in small quantities . It is impossible to overemphasize the impoxtance of eating on time and slowly . It is equally essential that you sleep sufficiently , go to bed at a regular hour , and get up when your alarm clock goes off . Also you will have to give up alcohol , and use tobacco , tea , and coffee with moderation . Your doctor will give you some medicines , antacids , to cut down the acid in your stomach , to reduce the activity of the stomach in secretion and motility , and to calm your nerves , These drugs are not curative ; they just help . Much has been done to relieve the acute symptoms of ulcers , and some of the treatments hold great promise . Among them is that developed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellevue Hospital . It consists of a diet of hydrolysates , or predigested proteins . The patient is given only @#  | hydrolysates , in powder form , and carbohydrates , estimated in calories according to body weight . For instance , a 132-pound man requires 2,400 to 3,000 calories . He is given his feedings every 2 hours while he is awake . If he wakes at 7 in the morning and goes to bed at 11 at night , he will have 9 feedings . In many cases , this treatment relieves the symptoms quite dramatically in about 24 hours . However , the treatment is continued . Then , if the patient is free of symptoms for 2 weeks , he is given breakfast of an egg ( not fried ) , toast , and cooked cereal . He then gets his regular hydrolysate feeding until suppertime . If he still has no symptoms , he has dinner of chicken or beef ? boiled , steamed , or broiled ? with toast and mashed potatoes . This is followed by hydrolysate feedings . The next day , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As time goes on , he gets different types of food , added slowly ; but no fried foods , spices , nuts , condiments , alcohol are permitted . Smoking is cut down to a maximum of 8 cigarettes a day , or no cigarettes at all , if indicated . Dr. Co Tui had observed that patients given predigested proteins for building up before operations improved considerably . Patients being prepared for operation for ulcers sometimes felt so much better they walked out , refusing surgery . He reasoned that predigested proteins neutralize acids ; they are a rich nutriment and so help in the healing and repair process ; and because they demand no effort on the part of the digestive organs , they may have a quieting effect on the gastrointestinal tract ; therefore they might make a satisfactory treatment for ulcers . Although he and his associates have been concentrating on cases in which other therapies have failed , it is reported that he has had , in the 4 years in which he has been experimenting , only 8 percent of recurrences . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They may cause diarrhea or vomiting , sour mouth or heartburn . However , the doctors feel they are learning to control these conditions . At all events , they are a small price to pay for the results . With Dr. Co Tui 's therapy , the patient often ceases to suffer the acute symptoms after 24 hours ; he frequently feels well in about 3 weeks ; his attacks may be reduced to 1 or 2 a year . And most of the cases ordinarily treated in hospitals can be cared for at home . IN CERTAIN cases , surgery may be the i only answer : in an acute emergency , when the ulcer bleeds and the hemorrhage can not be controlled ; when the ulcer perforates and makes a hole into the peritoneal cavity and lets out the gastric juice , thereby causing peritonitis ; when the patient fails to get well under the most favorable circumstances . Five to 10 percent of ulcer patients who cooperate wholeheartedly with excellent doctors still do not improve . They may suffer continuous pain and even vomiting . Consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormously within recent years . The type of operation is , of course , dictated by the emergency . During the past fifteen years , however , the most generally accepted and effective operation has been subtotal gastrectomy , which involves removal of about two-thirds of the stomach . This is a big operation , to be accomplished only by well-trained surgeons , for a considerable part of the digestive apparatus is taken out . In spite of this radical procedure , however , ulcers recur in a small percentage of cases . So search for better operative means continues . Within the past few years , surgeons at three large institutions have had success with the . " vagus resection . " With this method , the surgeon cuts the two vagus nerves , which supply the stomach and are responsible for the production of an important fraction of the acid secretion and the motor activities of the stomach . This operation leaves the stomach intact . It attempts to reproduce by surgical means what the doctor does with drugs and what the psychiatrist accomplishes . Results from the vagus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of their patients who undergo this operation suffer recurrence of their ulcers . They admit , too , that about 10 percent of their patients notice by-products of digestive disturbances after the operation . To the layman , a record of 95 percent of cures seems spectacular . The cautious scientist points out , however , that the operation is very new , that ulcers may recur even after a long time , and says he wants a patient to stay well for twenty-five years before he will state positively , " You 're cured . " The recurrent character of ulcers is their worst feature . You can avert a recurrence in some instances , but in others you are helpless . WITH any treatment , whether surgical v or merely medical , you must relax . Excessive Tension , undoubtedly part of your make-up , contributes to ulcers . Take life more easily , do n't worry , do n't hurry , slow down the tempo of your life . Tell your doctor frankly your problems . You are n't really neurotic and you do n't need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your everyday situations and show you how to adjust to your circumstances . And this helps him treat your ulcers . You must be cautious about your diet and habits , and you must not be careless , ever . If you feel fine the day you go off to a class reunion , do n't think that just this once you can eat and drink whatever you please . If you do , you may wake up with that familiar stomachache and have to start all over again . Too much alcohol is always dangerous for ulcer patients . If you have cut down smoking , do n't think you can gradually increase your cigarette quota , for excessive smoking may cause a recurrence . Any upset in your diet , your habits , your hours of sleeping , working , playing may have adverse results ? although you 've heard of people 's kicking over the traces on vacations without paying for it . You can control your regime , but you can not always avoid infection . Illness ? especially colds , the flu , and other ailments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach and causes a recurrence of ulcers . And you ca n't always avoid tension , anxiety , and frustrations . Try as you may to control your emotions , you can not always do it . And then you have trouble with your ulcer . Many ulcers recurred during the depression . In London ulcers were a serious problem when bombing began , as they were all over Europe . In Holland physicians struggled with recurring ulcers , especially among people working in the Underground during the German occupation . After the Allied invasion of France , when hope surged , the incidence of ulcers dropped noticeably . So the best you can do is to take reasonable care of your health , do n't become irritated or tense over trifles , and never indulge in departures from the regime your doctor prescribes . And do n't worry . Do n't listen to the advice your friends offer . Do n't pay any attention to the old wives ' tales about acid in your stomach . A certain amount of gastric acid is useful and normal . Acid is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ulcer ; but an excessive amount will not , produce an ulcer , nor will it prevent or cure one . Some people with a great deal of acid never have ulcers . And do n't be a victim of . any of the countless " cures " you may hear about . In good faith , many treatments have been tried . A few years ago , doctors used some injections , and people seemed to get well . Doctors and patients were equally enthusiastic ? until someone tried injections of ordinary salt and water and found that people got " well " just as readily . The 1947 pot of gold is enterogastrone . This is a drug maw from animal intestines . In laboratory experiments , enterogastrone has prevented ulcers . Although as yet doctors have had little experience in using it , they have noticed that the ulcer has a strong tendency to recur after dosage is stopped . Nevertheless , medical science thinks the substance is of great interest and may have some meaning . ULCERS are not pleasant ; there is no use pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , ulcers are not a bad balance wheel . They keep people temperamentally addicted to excesses from indulging . People who eat in a hurry , smoke too much , work too hard and too late , live at high speed must reform their ways . And by reforming they probably will live longer and be more agreeable to have around . So ; do n't feel sorry for yourself . A poached egg is as palatable as a fried egg . A ' few cigarettes that you enjoy are better i than a few dozen you burn merely to indulge a nervous habit . Protect your children against ulcers by giving them a balanced diet of simple food , and by making them eat regularly and slowly . Do n't let them develop habits that in later years might possibly lead to ulcers . Keep in mind that ulcers are a chronic , recurring trouble . Worry , excitement , bad temper , and other emotional upheavals , together with excessive indulgence , help them along ? but are bad for you . So keep calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep in mind , too , that although ulcers are no fun , lots of things are much , much worse .
