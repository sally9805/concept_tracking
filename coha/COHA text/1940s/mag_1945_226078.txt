The U.S. terms sent to London were harsh enough to revive the old Uncle Shylock cry . <P> Britain could have the $5 billion loan she needs to reconvert her war economy , and she could have 55 years to pay . <P> But the interest rate would be 2% ( the U.S. Treasury , which can borrow for less , would make a profit at this rate ) ; ill-prepared Britain would have to plunge again into fully competitive world trade and cast off her sea anchor , Empire preference . <P> These prohibitive terms were eased a bit by a provision that interest payments need not begin for five years , and by an escape clause under which interest could be postponed in years when Britain had an unfavorable balance of trade . Both were logical U.S. concessions : without the five-year grace period , Britain would simply pay the U.S. interest out of U.S. loaned capital ; the escape clause flowed logically from U.S. assurances to the doubting British that world trade was bound to revive and float British exports up with it . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes of an interest-free loan and who looked upon of i% as the maximum interest , the terms were little short of catastrophic . <P> The Unsold Case . The U.S. negotiators had not wanted to turn the screws on the British . Secretary of the Treasury Fred M. Vinson and Assistant Secretary of State Will Clayton sympathetically understood the British case , wanted to give Britain the best deal possible . <P> What was possible meant what the U.S. Congress would stand for . And the Congress , appraising the postwar mood of the U.S. people , was against " charity " to Britain . Congress was also highly sensitive to the probability that a British loan would encourage other nations , notably Russia , to come knocking on Uncle Sam 's door . <P> The U.S. Congress and public did not understand ( because it had not been told clearly and authoritatively ) that U.S. prosperity and hope of peace depended to a significant degree on the British loan . If Britain , appalled by the terms , refused the loan , these results were probable : 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocked sterling , thus shutting off a large part of the world from the general flow of commerce ; 2 ) Britain could scarcely participate , as the U.S. hoped she would , in the Bretton Woods plans for freeing currency exchanges and stimulating world trade ; 3 ) currency controls and bilateral trade agreements would restore the dangerous economic warfare of the ' 305 . <P> Moreover , the U.S. Congress and people had never been shown that the loan was a credit for U.S. food , raw materials , machinery . The U.S. economy in a critical period would be stimulated by exports to Britain . <P> Nub of the failure was that the U.S. negotiators and Britain 's persuasive Lords Keynes and Halifax had concentrated on technical points in their seven weeks ' negotiations , instead of taking time out to do a real selling job . Result : public opinion in both countries was more against the loan after the seven weeks than before . <P> Belts &; Millstones . Britons refused to feel guilty about Empire preference trade restrictions . British negotiators in Washington argued that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it was Britain 's only weapon for forcing down U.S. trade restrictions in the future .
