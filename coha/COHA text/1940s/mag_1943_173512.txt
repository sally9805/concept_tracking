There is grandeur in war , even in its evil ; and just now someone might say that the subject matter of this school of painting is very little , petty , inconsequential . . . . But . . . . <P> Last week two of the more gifted novelists of recent years made art news of a decidedly choice sort . One was the 45-year-old , German-born , U.S.-citizen-to-be , Author Erich Maria Remarque ( All Quiet on the Western Front ) . He lent Manhattan 's Knoedler Galleries , for non-commercial exhibition , his fastidiously chosen collection of modern and 19th-Century French art . <P> Fifteen years after the publication of his historic novel , Erich Maria Remarque is a retiring , deep-voiced , powerfully built man who enjoys his collections of antique Persian rugs and Chinese figurines as much as his French pictures . For four years he has moved his collections through a series of U.S. hotels and rented houses . The works are casually placed around his rooms , and never hung or lighted in a rigor mortis of possessiveness . Remarque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare rugs . <P> He is now working on his fifth novel , a psychological story about prewar Paris . He does not think of himself as a refugee . When he gets his final citizenship papers he plans to settle in or near Manhattan . <P> The other novelist involved in the show was the 42-year-old , Wisconsin-born , Left Banker-that-was , Glenway Wescott ( The Grandmothers , The Pilgrim Hawk ) . For the catalogue of the Remarque collection he wrote an eminently quotable introduction : <P> . . . The littleness of these pictures is what we shall have to live for again , when the war is done . In the experience of every man , every day , it is what constitutes peace . A grandmother seated in a doorway , dreaming in retrospect ; the flying step of a dancer across a stage , like a festive honeybee ; a watery cloud breathing over a hill ; cheap plaster of a poor domicile ennobled by light : yes , petty , if you like . But unless we care about such things , French things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more whole heartedly than we did in the last interval of peace - we shall never maintain the tedious vigilance and take the great trouble necessary to prevent war again , and again and again . Let every author on earth write an All Quiet on the Western Front : still it will not suffice , unless we all warmly feel that our ways , pleasures and sentiments and arts , are worth whatever it may cost to preserve them .
