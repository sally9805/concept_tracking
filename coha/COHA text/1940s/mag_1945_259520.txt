Most popularizers of science operate on the hopeful theory that anything , no matter how complex , can be reduced to terms a layman can understand . Radio hardly ever bothers to try . <P> Last week it did . Radio rushed in where such popular angels as Sir Arthur Eddington and Sir James Jeans have tried to tread : to explain the Einstein theory of relativity . It also tried to make the instruction painless-and all in one half hour 's time . <P> The audacious pioneer of this experiment is the University of Chicago , which has tried the trick before , with The Human Adventure ( Mutual , Wed. , 10-10:30 p.m. , E.W.T. ) , but never with a big name cast and ballyhoo . <P> Whiz Quiz . Veteran Funnyman Colonel Stoopnagle ( Frederick Taylor ) played the part , without obvious effort , of a know-nothing layman . Clifton Fadiman played the part , without obvious effort , of the omniscient explainer . Whenever Fadiman got too hot to handle , Colonel Stoopnagle was to order the orchestra to play . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Knowing that the spoken word has only a moment to sink in , the University 's writers wisely steered clear of mathematics , tried to get across only a few ABCs of relativity . <P> With much whizzing and sound effects , the Colonel was shot up in a rocket ship to a star , looked down at the earth through a telescope and was startled to see the battle of Waterloo just going on . ( Said Fadiman : " It took the light rays from Napoleon 's battle almost 200 light years to travel from the earth . . . . Things ca n't be observed to happen simultaneously in space . . . . " ) Then Stoopnagle was brought back to earth , put aboard a ship , where he observed that he was moving . ( Fadiman : " Everything in the universe is moving all the time . The motion of a single object can not be measured . . . except as it moves in relation to another . . . Relative is the key word . . . . " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Motion and the passage of light take time , therefore time is a dimension of measurement itself . " Pun Pudding . These tiny pills of theory were carefully concealed in a pudding of puns , skits and music . Human Adventure , setting out to be both entertaining and educational about Einstein , was only partly instructive , not wholly entertaining . Fadiman tried to give his hearers a glimmer of the theory 's importance : atomic scientists had used it , he said , in calculating the amount of energy in an atom . Concluded Fadiman : " Before Einstein , there was one essential error in the logic of physics - it considered the . . . <P> scientific observer stationed . . . on earth as the center of all things , and his observations of the laws of nature , the correct ones . The Einstein Theory made the laws of nature equally valid for all observers . "
