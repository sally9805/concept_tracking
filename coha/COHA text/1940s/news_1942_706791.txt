txt Another convoy with thousands of United States troops has arrived . Amid the gray shapes of British warships which brought another outfit across the Atlantic one sees riding quietly at anchor the merchant vessels . Despite the fact that the United Nations are protecting the long sea routes to Australia and the Middle East , the Royal Navy is able to provide a margin of safety in escorting United States soldiers coming to Britain . American troopships are still getting through . Here at this port , with its barrage of balloons , winking lights and warships , grim and ready , it is possible to get an accurate idea of what the United States is trying to do in Britain . There is a contingent of combat troops , but more air force ground men and pilots , plus service supply soldiers , who will man or help build the many supply depots that are being established to make possible the maintenance of a large combat army . Aboard one of the larger troopships alone all these arms and more were represented . Because of practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the handling of new Yanks a very smooth operation indeed . For hours after the ships slip in quietly from the sea there is intense but ordered activity , but it is in a vacuum , since unlike the case of the first arrivals in Britain , civilians are cleared away for miles along the docks . By the evening of the same day on which the vessels poke their noses into the harbor // silence again comes with startling rapidity and it is hard to realize that for hours you have watched a steady streq.m of helmeted , uniformed fighting men file onto trains until you think the parade will never end . Aboard the ships arrangements regarding the order and timing of the various units to debark in lighters are made before arrival , while ashore long trains stand ready to carry the troops to prepared camps in various localities , some of them ? a long distance away . Even before the scheduled time of the first lighters to reach the dock there are British officers on hand , with armbands indicating their particular tasks , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . Amid shouts such as " Wheah is ' ' that redcap at , " soldiers , loaded with full equipment and carrying heavy blue duffle bags , move in single file onto a station platform near by the dock . They look unusually tanned for this country of uncertain weather , and tough . The scene is particularly impressive , not only because of the warlike harbor background , with antiaircraft gun crews standing ready , but because the same process is going on at near-by stations , so that you can get an impressive Idea of the numbers of men arriving . Little boys and girls , whom the security officers ignore , stare open-eyed at both the soldiers and Home Guard band , which will parade and play steadily for hours to the greeting shouts of the newly arrived soldiers . The men are not supposed to know where they are , so they can not unwittingly disclose the name of the port later , but local Y. M. C. A. units proudly biazen it upon their coffee truck . It takes only a few minutes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it departs and another is moving up into position along the platform . At some docks two trains are loading simultaneously , yet there is surprisingly little excitement and no confusion . Just before the engineer of the first train pulls the throttle an amazed soldier comments to his companions : " Boy , this is a lot better than they handled the embarkation at home . " The station master , who is an important man in Britain and who is entitled to wear a top hat on certain peacetime ceremonies , is always present to blow the whistle as soon as he sees a train ready to go , and American generals , one of them as young as forty-two years , clamber up and down ships ' ladders in moving about the docks to be in a position to iron out any trouble , which , however , never seems to develop . Civilians of this area were out of luck today . The railroads give the American troops priorities and the home folks have to go to and from work in buses or on foot . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again for another batch of soldiers all but the latest troops ashore are likely to be eating their next meal at their own camps . The sun sets upon an empty scene and the fear of an air raid which does not materialize.
