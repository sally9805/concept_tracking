THE DARKROOM A STORY BY RODERICK LULL I T WAS the memory of the first time it had happened to them and George standing talking , a little bewildered , being very precise about what he said and assuming , quite unconsciously , a dignified and mannered voice . Then the other man 's voice cutting in , quick and harsh and determined , pointing out in untutored syllables the only two possible solutions . And George seeming to grow shorter before her eyes , while he sought again for the right words and failed miserably , saying it was just a little misunderstanding ; well , not quite that : it was just one of those unfortunate things that sometimes happened to everyone  --  well , almost everyone ; in a day or two now , or a week or a month at most ; why , this very morning . . . It had been hideous then , though not so hideous as it became afterward . And even then they had both known that what George said was not true ; that maybe on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . For a long time that evening after the man had gone , leaving behind him his ultimatum , they had sat together and made believe it was true . It was funny really , they had said . Quite screamingly funny , getting thrown out of your apartment  --  and oh , darling , my belly fairly aches with laughter . Why you know , Madge , I had the most splendid talk with Jeffries this morning . It was just unfortunate , he said , that nothing existed right at the moment . But I was just the man they needed , he told me , and it was very possible , almost probable you might say , what with the weeding out they 've been forced to do to get themselves on a more efficient basis , that I 'd hear from them in no time . He was most fulsome with praise  --  fairly made me blush to listen to him . It was nothing for us to worry about really , he said . Just one of those things the right man always finds the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen her cry . He had gone away to his darkroom then to work on a print he was rather proud of . The park , twilight , three poised gulls in the mottled sky ; almost black against the clouds a single tree moving in the light cool wind , an empty bench , a newly raked gravel walk . There was a competition coming up and they were offering rather decent cash prizes . He wanted to get it in and there was no time to lose  --  deadline tomorrow . Curious if it turned out your avocation became for a short time  --  oh , a very short time  --  your vocation . Well , stranger things had happened . By the time he had returned , holding the new print carefully in proud hands , she was no longer crying and be was too busy explaining the print , its fine points of texture and composition , to notice the redness of her eyes . And it was the memory of the times  --  two , three , four times  --  after that , and the declining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his coat , while she cried audibly without shame or reserve , and hated herself for it with a bitter intensity of hatred she could bring to bear on nothing else in the world . And , most strange of all , it was the memory of suits . The good tweed suit that always looked so well on his spare , well-turned figure , and the little worn place on the elbow that was so easily fixed at first ( a swell job , Madge , you 're a born tailor ; you 'd have to search for it to find it ) , and then was less easily fixed and at last could not be fixed at all . Then the memory of the dark , serviceable , close-woven suit  --  marvelous what they can do for a little money these days , really marvelous . ( I 'm sure I 've spent a hundred dollars for a suit no better than that ; those little details in custom-made clothes that they soak you for , the buttonholes and the lining and that sort of thing , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a sucker to pay for them . ) It looked as if the cloth was almost good , and came nearer than she would have expected to fitting fairly well . Of course it would n't take a press quite right , but if you were very careful and pressed it often enough ( thanks , Madge , that 's fine ) . And it was too the memory of so many other things , so many that some of them she had half forgotten and remembered only at intervals  --  dishes broken in moving and furniture going apart at the joints ; furniture sold and the piano they could no longer find a place for save in some dark hallway where it was impossible to use and simply got in the way of a door . And the other print that had won the prize , the ten-dollar third prize , and had provided the wherewithal for a reckless , unjustifiable celebration with a cafe dinner , cocktails , and the sight of a show from excellent balcony seats . And the letters home and back  --  hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried , equally obviously curious out of the cruel curiosity that even kind people have ; and back again , hers careful , cheerful , full of more or less intimate , homey little details : young George is doing so well ; I think I wrotehe won the mathematics prize in his freshman year ; apparently he 's a chip off George 's block ; the flowers are lovely this year in the park , we feel so fortunate to be only three blocks from it ; the weather has been a bit uncertain lately , and I wonder if you still have that old trench-coat I left when we visited three years ago ; it would come in handy for knocking about shopping , and so on . I 'm so ashamed we forgot a remembrance for Aunt Bertha 's birthday but we 've been so busy you know , and shall make it up double and more next year . . . All this , and much more . When he told her about it , sitting on the unpadded chair in the corner , she felt she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would give anything to have her chance at him with words , with her fists , with all her strength of mind and body . There was nothing useful she could say to George . She could only say , her voice flat , " It 's ridiculous . You 'd think a man was in his dotage at forty-three . " George 's voice came back to her , his controlled , weighty , analyzing voice , with the tone he used when he spoke of justice and necessity and the essential ways of a hard and competitive world . " Oh , you can see their point of view , I suppose . It takes some time before a man is worth anything to them , particularly in more important capacities . It 's that kind of a business . Frankfort told me himself and I 've no reason to doubt him , that they often have twenty or thirty thousand dollars invested in a man in the research department before they get a nickel out . So they naturally want to be sure he 's of an age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty is the limit with them . They were damned pleasant , but as Frankfort said , there it is , and he has no authority to change it . After all , as he pointed out , he 's only an employee himself and has no control over basic policy . " " Yes , " she said . And wondered why she had said it , a single , meaningless word that somehow took on ominous color and stood in space between them in the room . " Yes , " she said again , and the word was gone . They were alone together and it was time for young George to be home from school , it was almost time for dinner , it was going on night , the end of another day . He stood up then , went to the window and stared out into the darkening street below . He stood very still , one hand on the window ledge , and spoke to the window . " Well , they 're not all like that , nor most of them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . I was looking in Business Digest to-day  --  in Frankfort 's outer office while I was waiting for him . Things seem to be picking up  --  not to the extent everyone had hoped for , but noticeably . I was amazed how much better times are than last year  --  I had n't thought it . During the next three to six months , they said , the improvement should be rapid and progressive , in almost all lines . . . She saw , very vividly , the way he had sat erect in the chair in the outer office , holding the Business Digest with stern , strong hands , reading the encouraging words over and over , almost committing them to memory . Turning a page , then going back to what he had read , the few sentences of type that were alive with meaning and with hope , as if the type made a highroad into the future , straight and sure and direct . And in the reading of this was happily forgotten all the similar sentences of type that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leader said this , the investment Analyst said that , the Economics Fortnightly said so . Always , in the darkest of periods , there were lines of type that spelled hope , spelled the prospect of security , spelled useful work thoroughly and imaginatively done , spelled the gentle , sufficing weariness that comes at the end of a day profitably spent with busy hands and an undistracted mind . He turned away from the window and for the first time since he had come home looked at her . This was the moment sheshould fill with words , she thought ; this moment , perennially recurring , was as familiar to her as her fingers , but the words were not there . " I 'm quite sure , " she began slowly , and repeated herself stupidly , " I 'm quite sure oh , it must be getting better now , it 's been such a terribly long time ! " She saw him stiffen and would have given all and more than she had , all her own personal hopes for the future even , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with the calm , invigorating words she should have said . For what she had said had been not a statement but a lament , pitifully weak , a keening in the vast , darkling economic wilderness that surrounded them . " I mean , " she began again , forcing herself to meet his eyes squarely , glad that it was now so dark that neither could see the other clearly , " I mean that we 've really got something to feel glad about . " Then , as if through motion she could counteract her inability to speak properly , she crossed the room to him and put a hand on his shoulder . He looked down at her and smiled gravely . She felt his arm slip about her . She heard his breathing , deep in his chest . When he drew her very close to him she felt , through his thin suit , the shape of his fountain pen and automatic pencil . But when she looked up at him again she no longer saw his face except as a vague sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The letter , she thought desperately , was really not there at all but put away in her bag , a bit crumpled from a half-dozen readings . But when she looked for him the letter stood between . A polite , cold letter , on good quality embossed stationery : " My Dear Mr. Farnsworth : Because of your refusal to make a substantial payment of the back rent due us , as we have requested in three communications since the first of last month , we regret to inform you that we must demand that you evacuate your apartment . As required by law , we are giving you ? " It was happening again . Most hurt-ful things , if they came sufficiently often , brought with them their own anaesthesia . But not this thing . Always the wound was deeper , a greater pain . She said , " Did you see Crabhorn ? " He looked at her vaguely , as if she had broken into serious , intimate thoughts with an alien suggestion that forced him to return from some faroff territory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crabhorn ? Oh , yes . I called him from Frankfort 's office . He 'll have a bit more work in ten days , and he wants me . I 'm afraid  --  well , it wo n't be even so well paid as last time . It wo n't give us a chance to work out on the bills . But  --  oh , hell , what you get there does n't matter . Not really . I 've the feeling the good break 's coining soon . You know , after what I 've read by the people who are supposed to know and been told . " Very gently she stepped away from him . " I 've something on the stove . " He followed her out into the kitchen and while she busied herself with dinner he opened the little closet where his photographic things were stored . There was not enough space for them , and the bottles of chemicals whose use she had never understood and whose names she always forgot were piled one upon the other in a welter of cans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of completed prints and the enlarger which , along with his camera , he had once suggested he sell . He had suggested it coolly , as if it were the smallest of matters and the most natural of actions ; afterward she thought it was this manner , so obviously created to conceal something felt so deeply that even she must not be allowed to see it , a thing too intimate for even the dearest being to be made aware of by word or gesture or inflection of voice , that had made her stop him . He untied one of the boxes of prints and began running through them . " You know , " he said , " I 've some good stuff here I 've never made use of . I think there are half a dozen , given the right kind of cropping and printing , wouldhave a chance in one of the big contests . There are two or three coming up in the next few months . I do wish I had a decent room for all this . " Of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish for a decent darkroom and laboratory . The last place but two they had lived in had had it . The little closet he had converted into his camera room had been of good size and nicely ventilated . For him , she realized , it had done more than she knew to mitigate everything else . And , because of him , it had served her well too . " Some day , " she said , making her voice gay , her back turned as she seasoned the soup , " you shall have the most magnificent photographic room in all the State . And a library off it for the exhibition of your best prints . " " I do n't want a magnificent room , " he said testily . " I only want a little space to work in ? " He laughed . " Excuse me , " he said , " my name is Old Scrooge . Now , look at this . If I cropped out that house so the barn would be the dominant thing , do n't you think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes clumped along the floor . The boy came into the kitchen , carrying two or three books and his lunch box . He stood for a moment in the doorway looking at them , brushing his thick dark hair back with nervous hands , before greeting them . She felt like a knife his amazingresemblance to George when she had first known him  --  after all , he had been not many years older . The same keen gray eyes , the same quiet , confident look , the same air of expectancy and achievement . For him , she said to herself , for this boy who is ourselves , who is all of ourselves , it will come , he will have it . It must come . Dear God , let us have this one all-important thing . . . George said , " Hello , Spike , " and the boy laughed and put down his books . She ran a quick hand across her eyes , smiled , and kissed him . It was all quite bearable while they were eating . For then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forks raised full to the lips and returned empty to the cracked green plates , of knives biting raggedly into the tough beef , the hard sound of a cup returned to a saucer . Long ago she and George had given up sustained conversation at meals ; it was a time for light , clever talk of pleasant aimless things , and when you had neither heart nor mind for that silence was better . The boy , a young and eager animal , was content simply to eat . She dreaded the time , so near , when dinner would come to an end  --  the plates of gelatine emptied , the spoons finally put down , the second cup of coffee consumed . The boy would go to his little room to study . George would roll a cigarette awkwardly . It was strange , so clever was he with his hands in many ways , that he had never completely mastered the simple art of this . She would clear the table , taking a long time about it , stacking the dishes ever so carefully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again the worn linen pads that had been a wedding present those many centuries ago . And there would come the inevitable moment when all was done , when there could be no reason for further delay , when she would sit down opposite him and put her hand lightly on his and tell him about the letter . How brutally quickly the dessert was eaten , the final cup of coffee drained I Dinner was over . She sat straight in her chair , watching George roll the cigarette . He folded the brown paper neatly and filled the channels with the fine-cut tobacco . A few bits of it trickled from the open ends and onto the table . And while she watched him move thumb and forefinger in rhythm to make the cylinder she felt a sudden , completely ridiculous emotion of horror at the sight . It was as if this simple , frequent act had become a dreadful symbol of what was happening tothem  --  as if it carried always with it the stigmata of poverty and failure and defeat . Then the cigarette was rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eagerly she thought up questions to ask him  --  how was school to-day ? Good , good . And that nice Miss Masters , who taught English history and had been struck by the car  --  an awful thing , and she hoped she was getting along nicely . Was he finding Composition less difficult ? He answered seriously , weighing his words , his face grave . She glanced at George and saw him watching their conversation with proud eyes , the cigarette drooping from his mouth . He had , as usual , the air of a well-fed , prosperous , and able host at a bounteous table of his providing . The lines of care were there , the hollows in the cheeks and beneath the eyes , and the nervous tapping of his fingers upon the arm of his chair . But you did not notice these things unless you looked for them . The talk about school died for want of material and George spoke . " I was talking to an old acquaintance of mine about you to-day , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , we of course hope that when you 're through with high school you 'll be able to go to college . We 're quite confident that will happen . But ? " he hesitated , picking up a saltcellar and looking at it curiously as if it were some rare and unusual object as to whose use he could only speculate ? " in the world as it is now , the best laid plans will go astray . And National Manufacturing has a very fine school for selected young men . It really amounts to an intensified university course in engineering , according to Mr. Frankfort . So under any circumstances it will give you something as you learn . Afterward , naturally , you work for them . There 's some sort of a contract  --  I do n't quite know how it works ? " He put the saltcellar down hard and cleared his throat . The boy looked at his father with inscrutable eyes . " Sure , " he said , " sure . That 'd be fine . I 've ? ? 4100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow . " She did not watch him leave the room . She heard the hard click of his shoes on the floor and the soft sound the latch made as the thin bedroom door closed after him . She thought , he does n't know what it meant to George to have to say that ; he will never know , unless he is in George 's position some day , and God forbid that . No one can ever know what it means to him to have to say such things , and so often . I know better than anyone but I can never know all of it . No one can ever know that  --  no one is ever as close as that to another person . She rose and cleared the table while he rolled and smoked another cigarette . He made a neat little mound of ashes in the center of his plate , brushing stray bits of ash into the main pile with the tip of his forefinger . They were far apart now with something strong and dark between them . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the insane urge to dash against it , to strike it with her fists , to damn it with her voice , to rend it with her nails . She stood in the kitchen and heard him come in after her . " If you 're going to do the dishes let me help . " She said without turning around , " I 'll do them in the morning . I 'm a bit tired . " She was thinking that she must tell him about the letter now . It could n't be put off any longer . She said softly , " George . " " Yes . " He was very close behind her now . She thought she could hear his breathing . She turned swiftly round and flung out her arms . His own arms went about her and one hand patted her shoulder gently . When she moved her head her cheek brushed against his rough skin . She wanted desperately to say idiotic , sentimental things . She wanted to say how unutterably much she loved him and that so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about , and to say eloquently her faith in him , and more than this , much more than words existed for . He said , " What is it ? " " Nothing , " she said strongly . " I 'm just tired , a weepy old woman . Do n't let go of me for a minute , darling . " She would tell him , she would have to tell him and soon , but not now . In the morning he went off early to see still another old acquaintance who had risen in the world and had recently returned to the city after a year away managing an outlying plant of the company for which he worked . Breakfast as usual was a hurried , disorderly affair and soon after the boy had left for school he picked up his hat , kissed her and left . She stood at the window watching him pass along the street , a little stooped but still walking swiftly with his vital , muscular gait . She held herself back a bit from the window so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her and perhaps wonder if there was anything wrong of which he had not been told . She rushed through her housework , deliberately cutting corners and leaving little tasks undone , and within the hour left the house too . She walked until she found a store where she could buy a paper , then stood on a corner , impervious to the curious eyes of passers-by , and read through the For Rent notices , marking with a pencil half a dozen that seemed possible . Those which did not mention rent she passed over ; inevitably , she had learned from long experience , they were far beyond their means . And then she thought swiftly , they are all that , there are none so cheap we can really afford them , there is nothing at all left for us and for such as us . She lifted her head , folded the paper roughly , and set out in the direction of the place that seemed most likely . Soon after noon she was home again , conscious of a gigantic weariness . Her memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of landladies with hard voices and dirty , rumpled hair , of others smelling of cheap perfume , with suspicious voices and smiling , inquisitive faces . And serving as background to each of the faces were street numbers and rooms and doors and stairs and furnishings ; a shabby rug of faded green and yellow with moth holes at the edges ; a mahogany table that had once been fine , now scratched and scarred and with a badly mended leg that teetered ; a kitchen without a window so small she could n't turn about in it ; a living room with a fine bay window looking out to sea , part of a flat whose price caused her to take a last wistful look round , say thank you and leave , with the frail excuse that no one ever believed  --  she would think it over . But she had found a home for them , which was not greatly worse than what they had now and was cheaper still . It could be paid for each half-month and she had had enough for the first period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room that could be made quite pleasant with a little paint to cleanse the walls and take away its air of perpetual darkness . And , most desirable of all , a small , closetlike room with no apparent purpose at all , which could be used for a darkroom . She had debated it , before she had seen the little room , thinking that maybe it was possible to do better ; a decenter part of town at least and a street less like an alley . But the little room had decided her and she had made her payment at once . She made herself coffee and sat down to plan in her mind where she would put the few pieces of their own furniture and how she would arrange that which came with the place . She had it all planned and was telling herself it would really be almost attractive  --  at least it would not be so bad as it had at first seemed to her  --  when the door opened and George came in . He put his hat carefully on the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and managed a smile . " All dressed up , " he said . " Been out ? " " Yes . Did you see Giddings ? " George sat down and rolled a cigarette . " I saw him . He was really very nice . Quite encouraging too , in a way . There did n't happen to be anything new in my line , he said , but they were making some plans and there was a good chance there 'd be an opportunity in their laboratory . He said he 'd certainly keep me in mind if it turned up . And he 'd like to take me to lunch , he said , only as luck would have it he had a business appointment he could n't get out of . " " That was nice , " she said . " That was very nice . " Her voice was not her own voice at all . " George . I must tell you this  --  there was a letter yesterday . We have to move . " He looked at her with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They gave us notice . And I found a place to-day . It 's five dollars cheaper . It 's really  --  really quite pleas-an t . " He looked away and the cigarette burned itself out unnoticed between his fingers . She rushed on and her voice grew warm now , a little desperate , as she tried to make it cheerful and even gay . " A fine living room  --  only a little smaller than this . We can paint it some day and brighten it up . And there 's a good place for the walnut table  --  it will really look very nice if we refinish it ; I 've been meaning to do that , it should n't be hard . And the bedrooms are quite comfortable I 'm sure , and it 's all quite clean . And  --  listen , George . " " Yes ? " " There 's a little room that we can use ? that you can use for your photographic things . A perfect little room without a window , but with a light . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little work on the door you can make it completely dark . It 's what you 've been wanting so long , George ; I was so happy when she showed it to me . I know she would n't mind if you put up little shelves and made sort of a table  --  I think I remember a little kitchen table that 's already there and that we wo n't need . " She ran down suddenly , as an unwound phonograph runs down . She spent a long silent minute lashing herself , thinking up more words and sentences , discarding and changing them , realizing desperately the danger now of a long silence , of the need for talk and brightness and encouragement . " I know if you have a decent place for your pictures you 'll be able to do something with them more than we realize perhaps . You 've such fine pictures , so much finer than so many you see in magazines . And you can be all by yourself in this room , quite undisturbed , and there can be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think paint it for you myself , just for fun , perhaps a nice blue and the shelves red . And the table  --  well , red too , I think , like the shelves . You 'll have a fine time with it , George . " Now she had said all that was in her and new words must come from him . She looked at him . He sat very still , the dead cigarette still between his fingers , and stared at the wall . She said , " What is it , George ? " After a long time he answered . " It 's something else Giddings said . Something I had n't told you yet . It was about my clothes . He was terribly pleasant about it  --  quite a joke , the way he said it . He said , You scientist fellows are so damned sloppy . Never knew one yet who was n't , from Steinmetz down . But really , in these days  --  well , a good suit with a press pays dividends . ' We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had something there  --  you get interested tremendously in what you are doing and you never think about clothes . Oh , we made a splendid joke of it . You know , the absentminded professor  --  that sort of thing . And he was so kind in the way he brought it up . Very kind . Of course he could n't know I had n't another suit . Of course he was entirely right . Entirely right . " She leaned back in the chair and closed her eyes . She knew , with a sudden flash of intuition , what he would say next , and she told herself that she must be wrong , desperately wrong . She said , " Yes , George ? " " So I ordered a suit to-day . A very good , dark suit , for thirty-five dollars . It will be ready for me to-morrow . I had fifty cents in my pocket and I ordered a suit as if I had all the money in the world . It is a fine , satisfying thing to order a suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The emotion was all drained out of her now . She felt complacent , even  --  in a curious way  --  almost contented . She said again , " Yes , George ? " " Then I went to see Marcus . I got the camera and the enlarger from him and he knows what they 're worth . Seeing it was a forced sale , he made me a fairly decent offer . I took it and he paid me . He 's going to pick them up to-night . I said I 'd bring them down to-morrow , but he said he 'd call in his car . An enlarger is such a bulky thing . He was very nice . " It was then that she saw it as the funniest thing that had ever happened , the funniest thing in the world , and laughter swept over her . She laughed until her eyes watered and her sides ached and still there was no end to it . She lifted her hands to her face and laughed wetly into them and there was a tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain she remembered from childhood as coming from running too fast , from running and running . She laughed and laughed and could n't stop . But suddenly the laughter was done and she stood up , sickened at all laughter , at all things mirth-making , at all things glad and cruel and beastly and so humorous . She went to him and put her hand over his . He did not move . His hand was cool and dry to the touch . She was far away from him now , she thought wearily . Never , in all their life together had she been so far from him as now .
