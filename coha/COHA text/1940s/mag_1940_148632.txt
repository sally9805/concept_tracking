Jehovah 's Witnesses are a Bible-dizzy cult whose zealous members push doorbells , hand out pamphlets , play phonograph records , to anyone who will listen , denouncing the Roman Catholic Church . In New Haven , Conn. , two years ago , Witness Newton Cantwell and his sons Jesse , 16 , and Russell , 18 , toured Cassius Street-a lean &; hungry district whose population is 90% Catholic . Jesse Cantwell played his record to John Ganley and John Cafferty , Catholics . Squeaked the record , describing a book called Enemies : " This book submits the conclusive proof that for more than 1,500 years a great religious system , operating out of Rome , has by means of fraud and deception brought untold sorrow and suffering on the people . It operates the greatest racket ever employed amongst men and robs the people of their money and destroys their peace of mind and freedom of action . . . . " <P> The Cantwells were all arrested for soliciting money without a permit and for breaking the peace . Jehovah 's Witnesses are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts , with counsel supplied by their organization in Brooklyn , N. Y. The Connecticut Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Jesse Cantwell . By last week his case had reached the U. S. Supreme Court. * His lawyer , Hayden C. Covington of Brooklyn , argued that the conviction violated Constitutional guarantees of religious freedom . Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes interrupted sternly : <P> " I suppose these Catholics had some right of religious freedom themselves , did they not ? I suppose they have the right to be left alone and not to be attacked with these scurrilous denunciations of their most cherished faith . What have you to say to that ? " <P> " I say we are right , " cried Lawyer Covington . <P> " You can hire a hall . You can hold meetings and distribute literature . Is that the same thing as going into a Catholic home and delivering these attacks on their faith ? . . . Is there no limit at all to what you can do when you think you are worshiping your God ? " <P> Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mum . But when Edwin Pickett , arguing for the State of Connecticut , declared that it was unlawful to " stir up strife and discontent , " Justice James Clark McReynolds interjected that Jesus stirred up " a good deal of trouble in Jerusalem . " Mr. Pickett replied : " As I remember my Bible , something was done about that . " The Court took the case under advisement . <P> <P> * The Supreme Court decision of 1938 , that anti-pamphlet and handbill ordinances are unconstitutional , resulted from a Jehovah 's Witnesses appeal .
