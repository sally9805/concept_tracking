As the New Haven Railroad 's Colonial chuffed into Boston 's dimly lit Back Bay Station , the crowd surged up against the train gates . More than 1,000 were there , cheering and jangling cowbells . When a heavy-lidded , heavy-jowled man in a grey fedora stepped off the train , one oldster cried : " Three cheers for the greatest figure in America . " <P> Such was the homecoming last week for James Michael Curley , 71 , who is both a Congressman ( $10,000 a year ) and Mayor of Boston ( $20,000 ) . He was returning from Washington , where a Federal Court jury had found him guilty of using the mails to defraud . The welcoming committee , 1,000 strong , included his old friend Maxwell Grossman , who is also Boston 's Commissioner of Penal Institutions . <P> Jim Curley invited his friends to his home in Jamaica Plain for an informal reception , and they followed him out in a long and noisy motorcade .

If necessary , the " greatest figure " could run the city from jail .
