txt At this time it is impossible to know how closely the President 's budget estimates for the fiscal year 1947 will correspond with realities . It is probable , in the light both of past experience and of present legislative programs , that total expenditures will be even higher than his estimates and that revenues will be lower . If the present price level is held it seems unlikely , for example , that even the maintenance of the present tax structure will bring in as much as $31,500,000,000 in a peacetime year . It is all the more regrettable , therefore , that even the President 's estimates and plans do not contemplate a balanced budget in 1947 . For that fiscal year does not even begin until July 1 , ten months after the conclusion of the war with Japan ; and if Government receipts in 1947 approach anything like $31,500,000,000 , a balanced budget , and even a surplus , should certainly be possible . Such a balance would do more titan any other single factor to bring inflation to a halt . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would greatly exceed the average deficit in the years from 1930 to 1940 . In his message to Congress Mr. Truman expressed several times his concern with inflation . At the very start of his discussion of domestic issues he declared : " Our chief worry is still inflation . " In urging continued price control he said : " Today inflation is our greatest immediate dnmestic problem . " In discussing taxes he said : " Inflationary pressures still appear dangerously powerful , and illadvised tax reduction would operate to strengthen them still further . " Unfortunately he did not emphasize his concern about inflation where it was most important to do so  --  in connection with contemplated Government expenditures . Had he kept the danger of inflation as steadily in mind in discussing each item of proposed governmental expenditure as in opposing tax reduction , a far different budget might have emerged . For a proposed expenditure of $35 , - 860,000,000 in a full peacetime year would be stupendous . Only the wartime expenditures can blind us to its magnitude . It may help to restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures of a year before the war  --  say 1938 . Some of the increased expenditures are , of course , compulsory . This would apply to the increase from $926,000,000 in 1938 to $5,000,000,000 in 1947 in interest on the national debt ; or to the increase from $678,000,000 to $1,054 , - 000,000 in Social Security benefits . Such increases are contractual . We may go ? IP to admit that with our new responsibilities , and in the uncertainties of the post-war world , an increase in annual expenditures is necessary from $980,000,000 in 1938 to $16,000 , - 000,000 in 1947 for purposes of national defense . We may similarly grant the necessity of an increase from $572 , - 000,000 to $4,208,000,000 in veterans ' pensions ; or of the allowance of $1,754,000,000 for our international financial obligations ( though it is certainly logical to make an allowance on the other side for the $2,000,000,000 spent on domestic relief in 1938 that will not now be necessary ) . But when we have allowed in full for all of these increases over ' 1938 , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than $7,000,000,000 in excess of the rest of the 1938 budget . And if this excess in non-war items did not exist , the budget , with the same revenues , would not only be balanced , but there would be a surplus for debt reduction of more than $2,500,000,000 . We do not mean to suggest that every cut should be made from the rest of the budget , or that every item in the rest of the budget should be reduced to the 1938 level . What the comparison serves to emphasize is that the budget has grown not merely in the directions made necessary by the war and its consequences , but in all directions . The President 's budget plans to spend more in 1947 on the " general " expenses of government than in the pre-war years or even the war years ; it plans to spend more on public works than in the war years or the pre-war years ; it plans to spend more on aids to an already unprecedentedly prosperous agriculture than in the war years or the pre-war years . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tax burden intolerable in peacetime or a budget deficit that will increase inflation . To-rely on price-control is to deal merely with the symptoms of inflation ; to cut governmental expenditures is to deal directly with its causes . Governmental expenditures are Inflationary Pressure Number One .
