MILDRED PIERCE-James M. Cam-Knopf ( $2.50 ) . <P> James Mallahan Cain 's first novel ( The Postman Always Rings Twice ) was a tawdry , expert shocker . His second ( Serenade ) was a highly spiced account of singing and sex in Mexico . His third ( Mildred Pierce ) is the most interesting of the three . It is about almost ordinary people : a Glendale , Calif , housewife , her husband , her two lovers , her business , her daughter . It is as ugly as Hitler 's My New Order , even nearer home , and much more readable . <P> Mr. Cain 's three fascinations are the Laoconic stranglings of sex , money ( or its lack ) and snobbery . His heroine , Mildred Pierce , finds herself entangled in all three . Divorced after eleven tame years of marriage , she finally manages to support her children through a pie-bakery . But little else in her life is quite as easy as pie . The first of her lovers , her husband 's ex-partner , is only too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her second , an insolvent playboy , blandly accepts her money , calls himself her gigolo , sneers over her with her daughter Veda as a working woman , a moneygrubber , a " varlet . " <P> James Cain has a cold authority about suburban vice which could yield an invaluable gloss on Middletown or even on the works of Lardner and O'Hara . His trouble is not knowing when to stop . His money gets so cold , his sex so hot , his snobbery so snakelike and his dirty work so predictably subhuman , that their victims are scarcely more than caricatures of human fallibility . But the drugstore-library sensationalism that still overhangs Cain 's work does not stop him from being one of the most readable storytellers in the U.S. He has broadened his subject matter and , with a cruel anthropologist 's tenacity , virtually wrung it dry .
