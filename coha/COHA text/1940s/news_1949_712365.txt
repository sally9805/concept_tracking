txt WASHINGTON , Sept. 26 ? The disclosure that Russia has atomic weapons has increased the importance of current atomic energy talks with British and Canadian representatives and will probably put the conferences on a " continuing " basis , James E. Webb , Acting Secretary of State , said today . Mr. Webb spoke at the White House after he and George F. Reiman , State Department counselor , had reported to President Truman on ble progress of the three-power discussions that opened a week ago . Meanwhile , on Capitol Hill , Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper , Republican , of Iowa , asserted that " loose security policies " of the Atomic Energy Commission had " stepped up " Russia 's time table on atomic energy . Mr. Hickenlooper , who has attacked David E. Lilienthal , commission chairman , on the ground of " incredible mismanagement , " told the Senate that it was " certainly reasonable " to believe that the failure of the commission to tighten its security practices had permitted " vital information to filter out of this country . " Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee on Atomic Energy , later vigorously defended the commission and said that if there were any important security leaks , they occurred when // ATOMIC TALKS SEEN SET AS PERMANENT // the Army was in control of atomic energy . Mr. Webb , talking with reporters , emphasized that the present conferences , growing out of British requests for a greater sharing of this country 's atomic information , were " exploratory . " He recalled that the conversations were scheduled before word reached here of Russia 's progress in the atomic field . However , he and Mr. Kennan agreed that the new development had made the current talks more important and " it makes them very timely . " Mr. Webb , who heads the State Department in the absence of Secretary Dean Acheson , suggested that the talks would not end for another week because of the " complex subject " and the necessity for a " thorough understanding of each of our problems . " Mr. Kennan then said that " I have the feeling that there will be continuing talks , intermittently , from now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every peed now for full consideration of the best usage of the atomic resources of Great Britain , Canada and the United States . Uranium Division Involved In addition to the question of exchange of information , the representatives of the three . countries have been concerned with developing sources of . uranium , the raw material for atomic bombs , and with the proper division of this valuable substance among the three countries . Other State Department sources discounted the possibility that the talks had any bearing on a London press report that Great Britain was on the verge of producing as many as six atomic bombs a month . A spokesman said that it was not up to the conference to decide whether Great Britain could or should produce the bomb . In any event , the " exploratory " talks had not progressed to such a point , he added . Mr. Hickenlooper repeated in the Senate accusations of Atomic Energy Commission laxity in security enforcement that he had brought out in the Joint Atomic Energy Committee 's Investigation last spring . He centered attention particularly on about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only " emergency clearance . " This meant , he asserted , that some " very doubtful risks " had access to restricted data before a full inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation had been completed . According to a commission report , 4,095 employes received such clearance . The FBI check produced derogatory information against thirty-nine of these . None was found to involve espionage or suspicion of espionage , but nine were dismissed from their employment because of implications contained in their reports . ' Perfect Opportunity " Seen The commisssion 's policy , Senator Hickenlooper said today , had " provided perfect opportunity for infiltration either by espionage agents or for the employment of some people who are susceptible to the very clever influence of espionage agents . " He added : " While a number of factors , rip doubt , combine to enable Russia to produce an atomic explosion much in advance of the generally predicted timetable , nevertheless , it is certainly reasonable to believe that these loose security policies of the Atomic Energy Commission have permitted vital information to filter out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped step up Russia 's timetable for the effectuation of an atomic explosion by a very substantial period of time . We are , of course , still pre-eminent in the atomic energy field , but we should be . We must redouble our efforts to increase this leAdership and also the world must redouble its efforts to find a solution for peace . " Senator said in a statement that the Joint Atomic Committee 's investigation , in which Mr. Hickenlooper took a leading part , produced no evidence that any laxity on the part of the commission had helped Russia . " On the contrary , " Mr. added , " the evidence showed a profound and constant concern for security on the part of the commission . " Senator described the Hickenlooper accusations as " extravagant , " then said : " I listened to every word of testimony placed before the Joint Committee on Atomic energy during the recent investigation . There was not one scintilla of evidence produced to support any suggestion that loose security policies by the Atomic Energy Commission assisted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Soviet Rus- , sia must have been far along the path toward an atomic bomb in early 1947 when the civilian commission took over from the Manhattan Engineering District . If there were any important security leaks , they occurred under the Manhattan District and not under the present commission . " We do know from the Canadian spy trials that as early as 1943 , and probably even sooner , a Soviet espionage ring was . actively seeking atomic secrets . We also know that before World War II even began , the fundamental work upon the nucleus of the arom that paved the way for the development of an atomic bomb had been accomplished in many countries and was thoroughly known to scientists throughout the world . " However , Russia has the bomb today because its development was principally a matter of time and hard work . This is not a time for groundless accusations . We must concentrate all our energy and wisdom , not in seeking an innocent scapegoat , hut in finding a solution for the monumental problem that confronts us . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civilian-controlled successor to the Manhattan District. , which developed the atomic bomb in wartime under the War Department . Would Outlaw Bomb Mr. Hickenlooper 's speech followed a statement by Senator Joseph C. O'Mahoney , Democrat , of Wyoming , that it was " imperative " that continued pressure be brought to outlaw the atomic bomb . In the meantime Dr. R. E. Lapp , an atomic scientist who formerly directed an atomic energy committee in the National Military Establishment , said that he believed Russia definitely had the bomb and could produce about 100 of them in the next two years if she had the uranium . In an interview appearing in the current U. S. News and World Report , a news magazine published here , Dr. Lapp said he was also certain that Russia could not outstrip the United States in bomb production . Figures on this country 's potential in atomic bomb production have not been disclosed , but it was recalled that in 1945 Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer , a top scientist in the development of the first American bomb , indicated before a Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombs in two years ' time .
