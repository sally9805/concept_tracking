That magnificent character , the British Lion , forgot his Anglican manners last week , got up on his hind legs , and roared right in the face of his U.S. ally . The roar raised a transatlantic gale , but it also vented British vapors which had accumulated during five years of mannerly restraint . Afterward , the Lion felt better . The American objects of his spleen knew a little more about him and perhaps about themselves . British-U.S. relations may even have been improved by the week 's exchange . Said the New York Sun : " A steady diet of mutual admiration and respect would be wonderful , but it would be a terrific strain on human nature . " <P> The Twisted Tail . The roaring was begun by the London Economist , a formidably good-mannered weekly which has no U.S. counterpart but might be described as a cross between the Wall Street Journal and a New Republic with muscles. * Along with most of the British press ( notably excepting Lord Rothermere 's Daily Mail ) , the Economist throughout the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week , just in time to be answered by President Roosevelt ( see U.S. AT WAR ) , Economist Editor Geoffrey Crowther shed his inhibitions and stepped out , blowing hard : <P> " The British have been having a bad time in the U.S. of recent weeks . The outburst of criticism and abuse has been one of the most violent and sustained of the war years . . . .

And if Americans find this attitude too cynical or suspicious , they should draw the conclusion that they have twisted the lion 's tail once too often . " <P> That tore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " accurately expresses the thoughts of millions of ordinary Britons . " Two weighty sobersides , the Yorkshire Post ( owned by relatives of Anthony Eden 's wife ) and the London Times turned their thunders on hitherto sacrosanct Franklin Roosevelt , roared that it was time for the U.S. to state its policies and define its world responsibilities . ( After the President 's message to Congress , the Times applauded . ) Editor Crowther , whose first outburst had been marked by well-reasoned rage , came up again with an ill-timed , ill-natured , ill-reasoned diatribe against U.S. military policy . At this , even the Daily Mail was moved to shush the Lion , suggest that enough was enough . <P> How to Twist a Tail . What put the Lion in such an uproar ? In the U.S. , for the best part of a year , there had been less than usual anti-British criticism . At year 's end , British policy in Greece had disturbed Americans .
