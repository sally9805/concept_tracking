In an almost offhand way , Eleanor Roosevelt put her head in the lion 's mouth . In her column " My Day , " she noted that Francis Cardinal Spellman , Archbishop of New York , thought that Catholic schools should have a share in federal funds for education . Mrs. Roosevelt disagreed . <P> Schools supported by public taxes , she wrote , should be completely free of any private or religious control . She did not deny the contributions that " Catholic , Episcopal , Presbyterian , Methodist or whatever " schools might make to the community . But if a U.S. citizen wanted his children to have special denominational training , then he should pay for it and not expect the Government to . " The separation of church and state is extremely important to any of us , " she concluded . <P> When she got some mail accusing her of being anti-Catholic , she wrote a little tartly : " Sometimes I think church organizations are foolish because they do things that lead people to believe they are not interested mainly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decided interest also in temporal affairs . " <P> That probably did it . Francis Cardinal Spellman , speaking from his elevated position in the hierarchy of the U.S. Catholic Church , spread his wrath across a letter to her and forthwith made it public . <P> " Web of Prejudice . " She wrote from " misinformation , ignorance or prejudice , " he said . He would have ignored her " personal attack , " but she had continued her " anti-Catholic campaign . " Now " your misstatements should be challenged in every quarter of our country where they have already spun and spread their web of prejudice . " <P> He stood with Mrs. Roosevelt against " religious control of schools which are paid for by the taxpayers ' money . " But he was also certainly against parochial school children being excluded from milk rations , bus transportation , immunization programs , and the use of non-religious textbooks provided by federal funds . <P> " Even if you can not find it within your heart to defend the rights of innocent little children and heroic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the charity not to cast upon them still another stone ? " <P> Catholic youths , said the Cardinal , had fought for the U.S. " Their broken bodies on blood-soaked foreign fields were grim and tragic testimony to this fact . " Would Mrs. Roosevelt deny equality to those Catholic boys ? " Now my case is closed , " concluded the Cardinal . And even though Mrs. Roosevelt might " attack " him again , " I shall not again publicly acknowledge you . . . Your record of anti-Catholicism stands for all to see . . . documents of discrimination unworthy of an American mother . " <P> Vilification . Mrs. Roosevelt retired into shocked silence . Just as shocked but not as silent , New York 's ex-Governor Herbert Lehman rushed to Mrs. Roosevelt 's defense . " The issue is not whether one agrees or disagrees with Mrs. Roosevelt , " he said . " The issue is whether Americans are entitled freely to express their views on public questions without being vilified or accused of religious bias . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
