Most color photographers have been content with kodachromes , which are not prints at all but transparencies which must be held up to the light or projected on a screen to be seen . <P> Eastman 's new method produces a print in one operation . Main principle : a triple coating of sensitive chemicals on the surface to be printed , each layer of chemicals picking up a different set of colors from the transparencies . Final prints are not on paper but on a sort of celluloid , are at present processed-like home movies in color-only at Eastman 's laboratories . <P> A technical triumph , the process is yet of little practical importance .
