txt BUS PEACE TALKS ENDED BY THREAT OF 2 LINES TO SUE Further Negotiations Barred by TWU Unless Omnibus and 5th Ave . Cancel Actions SLOWDOWN LOOMS AGAIN . Quill Warns of Sympathy Steps ' on City Transit  --  Negotiators Find Deadlock ' Hopeless ' By A. IL RASKIN All negotiations for settlement of the five-day-old bus strike wee broken off last night after officials of the two struck companies an ; ' ? pounced that they would file dani ; age suits for $1,100,000 against Michael J. Quill 's Transport Workers Union , CIO .. Five hundred union officers and shop stewards voted not to re= sume peace talks with the New York City Omnibus Corporation and the Fifth Avenue Coach Conf= pany if the threat to sue were carried out . Even before this decision , anY possibility of a prompt settlement had been ruled out by a company declaration that the bus line 's would not bargain on provisions in a new contract until they received permission to charge higher Eared . City Labor Experts Gloomy With the City Labor Relations Division confessing that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union revived its threat of a sympathy slowdown on the cityoperated subway and elevated lines . At the end of a closed meeting of the 500 union leaders at TranV ? port Hall , 153 West Sixty-fourth street , Mr. Quill said it Was " Inge ' than likely " that a " spontaneous " slowdown would start on the subways . He added that the union had urged its members on the city lines to withhold any action along this line until the officers had a further opportunity to discuss it .. Fearing that the slowdown would start without warning , the Police Department instructed all borough commanders to assign men to subway stations to report on train movements and to prevent any jams that might occur if the union members started to slow down service by scrupulous adherence to all the requirements of the Board of Transportation 's 177 ; - page book of rules . A report to Police Headquarters at 11:15 P. M. that the - slowdown actually was in progress proved erroneous . No delays were reported anywhere on the IRT , BMT or IND divisions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to head off the threat of a strike on the bus and trolley car routes of the Third Avenue Transit Corporation , summoned members of his cabinet to meet at City Hall this afternoon to consider what steps could be taken to revive the prospects of a bus strike settlement . The one favorable development of the day was a unanimous decision by the union stewards to rata ? fy the pledge given by their leaders to cancel the Third Avenue strike call , which was to have become effective at 4 A. M. today . The threat was removed by -a promise on the part of the company trustees to meet with the union next Monday to discuss payment of $1,100,000 in retroactive wages . Quill Predicts Long Strike The pessimistic outlook for the two struck bus companies was emphasized when Mr. Quill disclosed that the 3,300 strikers would be told at a meeting today that " this is not going to be any one or two= week proposition . " ? " The companies started this thing , and we are going to carry out a finish fight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which exhausted its treasury in the conflict between right and left-wing elements that resulted in expulsion of the preCommunist faction last December , will appeal to the national Con , congress of Industrial Organizations for financial assistance , Mr. Quill said . Any lingering possibility that an easy formula for settlement could be devised was removed at -5 P. M. when Edmund C. Collins vice-president of the two companies , served notice that they would not negotiate a new contract with the union until they received permission to increase bus fares . The New York City OmnibIle Corporation , which carried a daily average of 925,000 passengers before the strike , has received tents= tive approval from the Public // SUIT THREAT ENDS BUS PEACE TALKS // Service Commission for a one-cent rise in its present seven-cent fare . However , the Mayor and the Board of Estimate have warned that the company will risk revocation of its franchise if it puts the eightcent fare into effect . The Fifth Avenue Coach Company , which received a twelve-cent fare from its 200,000 pre-strike riders , wants an increase to 13 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the companies , which have the same ownership and officers , would not insist on approval of the Fifth Avenue rise as a condition for opening wage talks with the union , but that no negotiations would be held until the omnibus company increase had been authorized . At City Hall it was predicted unequivocally that there would be no change in the refusal of the Mayor and the Board of Estimate to endorse higher bus fares , at least until after the municipal elections this November . Company officials envisaged some possibility that the Mayor might be impelled to retreat from his position by developments in the reorganization in bankruptcy of the Third Avenue Transit Corporation , largest of the city 's private transit systems . Case Up in Court Tomorrow Federal Judge Samuel H. Kaufman will preside at an open hearing in Federal Court at 10:30 A. M. tomorrow . on an application by the Third Avenue trustees for instructions as to whether they , can file eight-cent fare schedules ' with the Public Service Commis-1 sion . The state regulatory body has given a green light for approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have asked Judge Kaufman to determine is whether they can put the eightcent rate into effect without obtaining the city 's approval . Corporation Counsel John P. , the city 's chief law officer , has been notified of tomorrow 's hearing . Notice also will be given to the union and various groups representing bondholders . If the Third Avenue company raises fares for its 1,800,000 riders , other private lines will press for reconsideration of the city 's ban on increases in their rates . The day 's developments in the bus , strike brought a whole crop of new complications in what had started out last Thursday as a " quickie " stoppage confined to one garage ' of the Omnibus company . The original dispute stemmed from the suspension of four mechanics at 2 o'clock in the morning for their part in a protest against the laying off the night before of four other men , whose services the company considered superfluous . ' Mr. Quill and the union leader'ship gave their endorsement to the walkout , extended it to all lines of the Omnibus company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes of the Fifth Avenue company . The company contended that all parts of the strike were in violation of a contract provision prohibiting stoppages or , lockouts and requiring that all disputes be submitted to Theodore W. Kheel , newly designated impartial chairman of the private transit industry . The union retorted with a charge that the company had rendered the agreement inoperative by " firing " the four protesting mechanics in the middle of the night , by changing work schedules in the East 100th Street garage without consulting the union and by failing to take the dispute - to Mr. Kheel before any lay-offs were made . Mayor Enters Controversy Mayor O'Dwyer injected himself into this battle of charges a few hours after his return to the city Sunday by accusing both sides of " outrageous contempt " for the comfort and convenience of the riding public . He hinted that the city , which now operates 75 per cent of New York 's transit facilities , might move to take over the rest if the union and management failed to put their relations on a basis that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both parties were equally deserving of condemnation in the strike was believed to have been a major factor in the decision of the companies to go to court for a damage ' judgment against the union . The management view was that a court ruling that the union had violated its contract by calling the strike would be equivalent to a public vindication of the companies . Mr. Collins said the companies would decide this morning whether to proceed in the State Supreme Court or in Federal District Court . An action in Federal Court would be based on alleged violation of the Taft-Hartley Act . It would represent the first determination in this city of whether local buses are subject to the Federal labor law . According to Mr. Collins , the Omnibus company will seek damages of $750,000 and the Fifth Avenue company $350,000 . He said the claim would be increased at the rate of $61,000 for the Omnibus company and $22,000 for the Fifth Avenue Company for each day the tie-up continued . These figures represent the estimated loss in fares because of the strike . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday 's fruitless negotiating session in the office of Joseph E. O'Grady , director of the city 's Labor Relations Division , that accumulated deficits of $2,200,000 for the last two years made it " impossible " for the companies to negotiate a new contract until they get a fare rise . He said the Omnibus company ' apected a deficit of $396,000 this year if labor costs remained un- changed and the 7-cent fare con-1 tinued in force . The loss for the Fifth Avenue Company was esti- I mated at $285,000 by the company spokesman . Quill Comments on Suit When the companies notified the union that they intended to sue , Mr. Quill suggested that they were seeking to " take money out of the pockets of the workers " to pay the wage increases the union is seeking . His only comment as he left a conference with company officials at the Municipal Building was that the companies would " get an answer they wo n't like " from the union 's executive . committee and shop stewards . Before the conference Mr. Quill said he considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Board of Transportation would engage in a slowdown as a gesture of support for the bus strikers . " If the men should go over our heads and use the book of rules , then there would be a slowdown , " Mr. Quill observed . He added that this would be in the nature of a " spontaneous sympathy action " and should not be interpreted as a sign of dissatisfaction with the city 's own failure to raise the wages of its transit employes . The union has asked for a general wage ' increase of 21 cents an hour on the public and private lines , a forty-hour work week employer-financed welfare funds , liberalized vacations and other I concessions . The basic wage ! vial on the city lines and most private ones is $1.44 an hour , but the two struck lines have a basic rate of $1.50 an hour . When the Municipal : Guilding meeting broke up , Mr. O'Grady expressed the view that negotiations were " hopelessly deadlocked . " He said no new date had been set for a meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to his call . After telephoning to the Mayor , the citylabor chief announced that the Mayor would meet with the heads of the Police Department , the Board of Transportation , the Corporation Counsel 's office and the Labor Relations Division at 2 P. M. today at City . : all to explore the situation , Mr. Kheel , who took part in yesterday 's unsuccessful meeting , Will attend the City Hall session .
