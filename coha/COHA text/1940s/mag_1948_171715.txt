THE HEART OF THE MATTER ( 306 pp. ) - Graham Greene-Viking ( $3 ) . <P> <P> Edward Wilson , secret agent of His Majesty 's Government in World War II , sat on a hotel balcony and sourly surveyed the West African seaport to which he had been assigned . He saw row upon row of hot and hideous tin roofs sloping away toward the sea , and a ringing clang came to his ears as a vulture perched heavily on top of the hotel . Down at the quayside , pickaninnies swarmed like little vultures around a newly landed seaman and triumphantly escorted him to the local brothel . <P> Young Negro girls sat in the shade , " engaged on the interminable task of trying to wave their wirespring hair " ; a West Indian dandy traipsed through the squalid streets , sporting a feather boa . Then a white man , wearing a police uniform , hove into view-a squat , grey-haired man whom Wilson would barely have noticed if the Englishman at his elbow had not exclaimed : " Look . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Thus Henry Scobie , leading man in The Heart of the Matter , is singled out as by a movie camera 's swooping eye from the rest of the world ; and readers of Graham Greene 's previous novels will not have to read far in this one before they know that they have met Scobie and his world before . For this world , disguised though it is under African heat , is the same cruel , sordid , vulturous hell that Greene has conjured up in most of 14 books , and Hero Scobie is Greene 's equally familiar creation-a sinner disguised as a hero-villain . <P> <P> What makes The Heart of the Matter Graham Greene 's most profound novel is that Henry Scobie , who seems to have one skin less than his tortured predecessors , actually has one more . In Brighton Rock ( 1938 ) Graham Greene drew a horrifying portrait of an adolescent Catholic named Pinkie , who was headed straight for damnation , and dimly , desperately knew it . In The Heart of the Matter he draws a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it-apparently-much more clearly . Every man &; woman , of whatever color , who has run into Scobie during his 15 years as Deputy Commissioner of Police , admires or despises him because , in a world of utter corruption , Policeman Scobie seems utterly incorruptible . What they do not know-what Scobie himself does not know at first-is that in order to feed his voracious sense of pity , Scobie is ready , if necessary , to break the most cherished laws of both Church &; State .
