txt Taking issue with the public attitude of protestation of sympa .. thy4iitli the Allies , but little action to dry ' stalize such expression of good- will , the Rt . Rev. William Lawrence , Bishop Emeritus of Massachusetts , told delegates to the 155th annual Episcopal Diocesan Convention in Ford Hall today that , " Is this not the time for asking ourselves the question : What preparations ate we mak ing for carrying this Nation into leadership in civilization ? " " Here are some plain facts , " said Bishop Lawrence , honored for his continued activity in his ninetieth year , " Our country is piling up a debt of over $40,000,000,000 , a large percentage of which is used in giving us comforts for which not we but our descendants have got to pay ; a country - which has billions of gold stored in the mountains of Kentucky , whose drink bill is enormous , - whose public gambling runs into millions , whose Empire State has just adopted pari-mutuel betting , aemoralizing to thousands of youth , in order that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ; a country both curiously lawless , whose luxuries , sports and amusements are absorbing millions of dollars . - " We talk much , of ourselves as a great and a strong Nation , " the Bishop continued . " Our citizens write eloquently of international brotherhood and good neighbors and pronounce us ready to_the help and lead the world , but this Nation will not risk a single life to join those who are defending the principles upon which our country was founded . Facts Known in Europe " All these facts are well known to the peoples of Europe , many of whom ' are boiling with indignation . They may not say much publicly : it would not be prudent . We are a strong nation , and they must stay on good terms with us outwardly . " We are , in my judgment , moving along a path which will make us suspected , unpopular , and even despised among all nations . The truth is  --  and we know it , when we take time to consider  --  that the strength . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military defenders , or its form of government , except so far as these are supported by people of character . " Bishop Lawrence then named three qualities which he said the country would do well to cultivate , and expressed the hope that the delegates " would make this a personal matter , and not allow his thoughts to float off in vague generalities . He named as the first quality , honesty , a determination to face the facts , and to stand for the truth . Secondly , he named intelligent sympathy with the conditions of the others . Thirdly , he named sacrifice . " Besides friendliness and understanding , " the Bishop said , " there must be a readiness to adjust ourselves to others by mutual sacrifice . " Delegates to the Convention , last night heard the Rt . Rev. Henry Knox Sherrill , Bishop of Massachusetts , urge repeal of legalized horse and dog racing . In his attack on the race-betting law , Bishop Sherrill urged Episcopalians to work for its repeal . " There is a question of morality in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances of malfeasance in office " Conditions in the conduct of the horse and dog racing have become national scandals . No adjustment of personnel or of control will be sufficient to remedy this situation What is needed is the repeal of the present law . The economic and character-corroding waste far outweighs any income which the State now receives . "
