Scene : Living Room Time : 2500 A. D. during Warld War IX ( All constumes are futuristic and fantastic . FRANCIS ( Rocking and sewing a pair of baby pants . ) Willie ! Willie , dear ! WILLIE ( From the bedroom . ) What is it ? FRANCIS Come in here and sit with me . WILLIE What did you say ? FRANCIS I said come in and sit with me . You do n't have but a few days leave from the army , you know . WILLIE Ca n't . FRANCIS Why ? WILLIE ( Coming in adjusting parts of her uniform . ) Got to get back to camp . FRANCIS I thought you said you did n't have to leave until tomorrow night . WILLIE I know what I said ; but orders can change , ca n't they ? FRANCIS I did n't know they change that quickly . WILLIE What you ca n't seem to get through your head is the fact that we are fighting World War Nine . This is total , universal war against a ruthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 3 FRANCIS And leave us men here to sew and take care of the babies ? WILLIE Do n't be silly . Somebody must take care of the children . FRANCIS Children : children that men can never be sure are their own . WILLIE Cut out your beefing ! Even the Bible tells you that It 's a wise father who knows his own children . FRANCIS But we are n't talking about the Bible now . WILLIE Well , you men have father 's instincts , do n't you ? FRANCIS Sure . WILLIE When we women tell you , then , that you are the fathers of our children , your fathers ' instinct ought to let you know we 're telling the truth . FRANCIS But that does n't explain why you must go away and leave me alone tonight . WILLIE ( Annoyed and emphatic ) I told you I got orders to return to camp . Being a mere man , you ca n't understand that . It simply means when you got ta report , you got ta report , that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . But the army is n't doing anything about the lonely hours I have to stay here and suffer , the pang of waking up at night with nothing but the silent room and the lonely pillow for campanions. p. 4 WILLIE Do n't be such a cry baby ! War is war and we women must fight it . Here we are out on the battlefields getting blown to bits by big guns ; being shot out of the cold of the stratosphere , and the usky , sticky heat of the tropies . ( Laughingly ) We are doing all that and all you have to worry about is a lonely pillow . FRANCIS That 's rihgt go on and laugh ; but you do n't realize how it is to lie awake at night missing you terribly . WILLIE Is that so ? FRANCIS Why do you ask that ? You know its the truth . WILLIE I just want to be sure because I hear that slacker , Bobbie , comes around pretty often . FRANCIS ( Heatedly ) She 's no slacker ! And besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awhile ( aside ) when you 've gone . WILLIE Well , you 'd better watch your step . I expect you to be circumspect in every respect . FRANCIS That 's what all you women think . Why must we bem be circumspect and virtuous and you women run around and have your good times . It is n't fair , that 's all . p. 5 WILLIE How many times have I told you that women are women and men are men . The laws of the Motherland decide that when we deliver the children to you , you are responsible for bringing them up . You come closer to the tender minds of the young than we do ; so it is necessary to watch your conduct more . Now what would little Willie Junior think if she grew up and found that her father was a loose man running around with women . The very idea is repugnant . FRANCIS Repugnant or not , a man has his romantic feelings sometimes . WILLIE And whether you have or not , you 'd better not give vent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Half crying ) Get your bag and go . You do n't care how miserable you make me . ( Sobs . ) ( Another ring on the tell . He wipes his eyes and opens the door . ) ( A smart looking man dressed in a fantastic unoform enters . ) ALVA Good evening ! Is the senior officer ready ? FRANCIS She 's gone to get her bags . Are you her driver ? ALVA Yes sir ! FRANCIS I thought all the drivers in the army were women . ALVA Not anymore , sir ! p. 6 FRANCIS Are you in the army ? ALVA Yes . FRANCIS What beandh of the service do you belong ? ALVA I am a M. A. C. FRANCIS A who  --  a what ? ALVA A , M. A. C. FRANCIS I do n't understand . ALVA ( Proudly ) It 's a new branch of the service . It 's called the Men 's Army Auxillary Corps . FRANCIS Since you mentioned it , I do remember a recruiting advertising in the papers ; but I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmanly to put on a uniform , live in an army camp and fight . Why man , that 's a woman 's job . ALVA You must remember , that in days past men did most of the fighting . Why only six centuries ago men did all of the heavy fighting against Hitler . FRANCIS Yes , but that 's history . Men do n't do that kind of thing anymore . Why I would n't think of spoiling my figure by fighting in an army . ALVA You must rmember that World War Nine is an cricial stage ; and it is necessary to replace women in unessential jobs by men if we are to win this war . p. 7 FRANCIS And another thing , I could n't wear those old drab uniforms . Why I get the latest things from Vogue . ALVA Do you ? FRANCIS Sure . And before the war Willie used to get most of her things out of Esquire . ALVA Well , I 'll be glad when the war is over so we can get away from these drab uniforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never use hard soaps . I always use Lux Flakes they make my things so white and fluffy . ( Going to him and opening his shirt . ) Let me show you what I washed on Tuesday . WILLIE ( Comes into the room with a military stride . Alva salutes . ) Here , take my bag to the car . ( Alva takes the bag salutes and exits . ) ( She kisses Francis coldly . ) Goodbye ! I hate to leave you ; but I must go to protect the Motherland . ( Goes to the door walking in an exaggerated military fashion . ) FRANCIS ( Following her to the door . ) Goodbye , dear . Take good care of yourself . Wear your rubbers when it rains , and your overcoats when it rains . And keep your boots on at all times . p. 8 WILLIE ( Outside ) Do n't worry about me . Remember what I said . ( Francis comes back to the settee , and holds up the baby garment and cries . Bobbie dressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) BOBBIE Francis ! Francis , darling ! FRANCIS ( Looking up startled ) Why , Bobbie ! What you are doing here ? BOBBIE Why should n't I come ? When your wife leaves your sweetheart appears . FRANCIS I know ; but my wife has n't got that far yet . BOBBIE What were you crying about ? FRANCIS ( Crying . ) I do n't know . I am so happy I ca n't help but cry . BOBBIE Do n't hand me those fairy tales . I just saw Willie leave . FRANCIS I 'm glad to see her go . She is so filled with love for the country . BOBBIE But since when did you get so patriotic . You know you 're crying because she 's gone . FRANCIS No ! No ! I swear . BOBBIE ( Sitting down besides him ) Why let your lips swear to an untruth . You are starving for love and Willie leaves you all alone . p. 9 FRANCIS But that is n't true . BOBBIE Francis , dear , it is true ; and something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand you . I am the only one who can make you happy . ( She puts her hand on his . ) FRANCIS ( Pushing her hand away ) Bobbie ! BOBBIE ( With passion ) You know it is true what I am saying . But from now on you 'll never know what it means to want for love . I will take you away into a paradise world just made for us two . I will warm you with the flame of my passion . With my lips , I will kiss away all sorrows of yesterday and regrets for the future . My every waking thoughts will be of you ; and my dreams will be only of hwat will make you happy . ( She throws her arms around him . ) FRANCIS ( Taking her arms away and rising ) Do n't ! Do n't tempt me ! You know I 'm weak . After all you know I 'm only a man . BOBBIE ( Pulling him back ) Darling , do n't fight back . Love should not be a thing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful river . You know I can make you happy . Wo n't you let me ? It is only destiny-you and I on an earthly island of paradise . ( Francis struggles a bit and then gives in for a kiss. ) p. 10 FRANCIS ( Pulling up ) That 's all for now . BOBBIE What 's the matter ? FRANCIS Nothing . That 's enough that 's all . BOBBIE Why ? FRANCIS After all this is World War Nine , and kisses are rationed , you know . BOBBIE But who cares about rationing ? FRANCIS I do . Let me see , where is that list ? BOBBIE What list ? FRANCIS That O. P. A. ceiling list on kissing  --  Ah , here it is . ( Turing pages . Reading furniture , cars , milk , coin , beets , butter beans . . . . . . . BOBBIE Disgusting . FRANCIS What ? BOBBIE Here I am dying to make every minute count for love , and here you are talking about butter beans . FRANCIS And what is the matter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right then . Say off butter beans . ( Turning pages of list . ) Ah , here it is , Subject , Osculation. p. 11 BOBBIE Oscu  --  what ? FRANCIS Osculation . Do n't you know what that is ? ( Reading ) For the duration of World War Nine in which the Motherland is engaged , kissing must be regulated and ridgidly rationed . BOBBIE ( Sarcastically ) Oh , I would n't stop reading . FRANCIS I did n't intend to . ( Reads on ) A man is entitled to the following number of kisses from his lover ; One divine kiss , two half divine kisses , three ordinary kisses , five brother and sister kisses , and seven pecks . BOBBIE And what is a peck ? FRANCIS It is a difference in time . A peck lasts only three seconds . BOBBIE I 've a good idea to get around all this . FRANCIS It had better be good for if you are caught violating the law , the O. P. A. will take your kissing points away . BOBBIE I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . FRANCIS The black market ! BOBBIE Yes , the black market . FRANCIS To market we shall go ! p. 12 BOBBIE ( Pulling him to her . ) My darling what we have been doing up to now is pecking . Let 's move up the O. P. A. list to the divine . FRANCIS ( Sying back in her arms ) Say on , me Duff . ( They kiss . Willie opens the door . Both jump up . Francis hides behind the settee . Bobbie runs to the wall . ) WILLIE ( Angry ) So this is what I find ? FRANCIS You have n't found a thing , wifey dear . Nothing was lost . WILLIE You mean to tell me I 'm blind ? What have you to say for yourself ? FRANCIS ( Ruefully . ) If you do n't mind , I 'd like to say I wish you had stayed away to protect the Motherland . WILLIE Is that so ? It seems to me somebody here needs more protecting . FRANCIS Do n't worry about me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's too all right . ( To Bobbie ) And you , what are you doing here ? BOBBIE ( Trembling ) Who ? m-m-me ? p. 13 WILLIE Yes , you ! What are you doing here ? BOBBIE Why , I was just keeping up morale on the home front . FRANCIS And my morale was awfully low . Really it was , dear . WILLIE ( To Bobbie ) Stop dearing me . Have n't you got some nerve ? Just as soon as my back is turned , you sneak in and make love to my husband . FRANCIS ( With growing nerve ) Willie , dear , be calm and let 's talk this thing over . WILLIE ( Sharply ) There is nothing to talk over . You get your things and get out of here . FRANCIS I ca n't do that . It 's cold as balzes out there . WILLIE You heard me . FRANCIS And besides my lanudry has n't come back yet . WILLIE I 'm through with you .

WILLIE So , you are a coward , too , you dirty backbiter . BOBBIE It 's not a case of cowardise . It 's a matter of principle . WILLIE Well , it 's a heck of a principle . BOBBIE Not at all . I always held that man was something to be enjoyed , not to fight about . WILLIE Do n't worry , there wo n't be any fighting . Both of you go ! FRANCIS ( Putting his hand over his chest ) My heart ! My heart ! ( He falls in a grotesque and dramatic manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smiling ) That 's an old one . Get up from there before I shoot . FRANCIS ( Seeing that his trick did n't work , jumps up and hides behind the settee . ) My , God ! You would n't shoot . WILLIE No , I 'm not going to shoot you . Since you both have the grand passion for each other , go , and do n't let me see you again . FRANCIS Wo n't you give me one last dance , Willie ? p. 15 WILLIE Go !
