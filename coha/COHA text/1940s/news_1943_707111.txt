txt Physicians ' Action Criticized Repeatedly in the columns of your newspaper alarms have been sounded regarding the seriousness of the growing shortage of %physicians due to the fact that ever-increasing numbers are being absorbed by the armed forces . Under these circumstances the resolution adopted by the New York State Medical Society , reported in THE NEW YORK TIMES of May 5 , urging that citizenship be made a requisite for the licensing of doctors as well as other restrictive proposals , must strike one as a strange anomaly , to say the least . Such an effort to narrow the number of candidates for the medical profession  --  and at that candidates who have mostly had a background of years of practical medical experience in Europe before having been driven from there  --  seems curiously out of keeping with the crying need for more physicians and not exactly conducive to the furtherance of the war effort .
