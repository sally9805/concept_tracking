Franklin Roosevelt , sensing that there was some confusion in the labyrinthine operations of his Government , last week decided to clarify everything : he set up a new bureau , the Office of Facts &; Figures . <P> It was not the first time the President had similarly tried to bring order out of chaos . Two years ago the President set up the Office of Government Reports . Purpose : to keep the President informed . He put Lowell Mellett , a keen-eyed onetime news editor , at its head . This year it got $1,500,000 appropriation from Congress . Three months ago , with another fiat , the President installed Colonel William J. ( " Wild Bill " ) Donovan as Coordinator of Information . Purpose : to keep the President informed . Besides these special agencies , every Government department has its own information service to keep track of the nation 's defense effort . <P> The Office of Facts &; Figures is not supposed to overlap these other information mills-its function is to see that they get their stories straight . OFF will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other up , publishing contradictory figures , at least at the same moment . It will work behind the scenes with the Inter-Departmental Advisory Committee , will report to busy little Fiorello H. LaGuardia , director of the Office of Civilian Defense . <P> For chief of OFF , Franklin Roosevelt picked his friend Poet Archibald MacLeish , * Librarian of Congress , who occasionally helps draft a White House speech . To help him ferret out his facts &; figures , Director MacLeish will have blond , chub-cheeked Captain Robert Kintner , who gave up a lucrative Washington column ( with Joseph Alsop , just resigned from the Navy ) to take an Army commission , and rich , personable Lieut . Barry Bingham ( son of the late Ambassador to Britain Robert Worth Bingham ) , who gave up his job as publisher of the Louisville Courier-Journal for a commission in the Navy . <P> The arch-Republican New York Herald Tribune editorialized : " OFF will coordinate the Office of Coordinator of Information ( or OCI ) , report on the Office of Government Reports ( the frequent reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , press-agent the innumerable Press Agents of the Individual Departments ( often called the PAIDS ) and will under no circumstances do anything whatever that anybody else is doing already . . . . When the Office of Utter Confusion and Hysteria ( to be referred to as OUCH ) has finally been created , then the capstone will have been set upon the pyramid and we can all die happy , strangled in the very best red tape . " <P> One Washington official who thought OFF almost as absurd as the Herald Tribune made it sound was Wild Bill Donovan , who , according to New York Times 's Arthur Krock , had dreamed up an ingenious idea : an immense glass globe , lighted from within , to show President Roosevelt the disposition of all the world 's armies , navies and air forces , and their positions from day to day , the economic resources of every theater of war , changes of population and their racial origins , war production in industrial areas-all projected on the surface of the globe in shining Technicolor from films inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be about the size of the Perisphere at the late World 's Fair . <P>
