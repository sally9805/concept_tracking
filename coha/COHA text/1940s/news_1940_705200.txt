txt A new government officeto plan and clear rearmament orders is an inevitable outgrowth of the defense program . Commander L. B. Combs , assistant chief of the Navy 's bureau of yards and docks , told the Producers ' Council yesterday . In the same session , the building equipment producers were warned by Commissioner of Public Housing W. E. Reynolds that " inflated prices " may interrupt the defense housing program in a very few weeks . " Later . Russell G. Creviston , director of trade relations of Crane Co .. told the group that " we must guard against unwarranted price advances , as they will inevitably lead to loss of markets and ruinous inflation . " Hartman Voices Reassurance The council was reassured by Brigadier General Charles D. Hartman. chief of the Army 's construction division , that price fixing for the construction program as a whole would not be necessary because the industry had cooperated " most satisfactorily . " Discussing the Navy 's plans for " on shore " building , which he said would bring another $100,000,000 of awards in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of priorities under the present system are too broad and that further study and more detailed regulation arc essential if delays and confusion are to be prevented . Shipbuilding and aircraft production is in especially great need of a more detailed priorities system , Commander Combs said . To accomplish this reclassification , he suggested the setting up of a new office to make a detailed study of all essential manufacturing plants . This investigation would be continuous so that the government would always know the capacity , backlog and unused capacity of every plant . In this way , he said , it would be possible to award contracts to the producer who could deliver fastest without interrupting his other business any more than necessary . Establishment Already Recommended The new office would clear every contract , set its delivery date and assign it a definite , detailed priority . After he had finished his address , Commander Combs told a group of questioners that a letter recommending the establishment of such an office to carry out the " **31;558;TOOLONG procedure ' had already been sent to the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the priorities board of the National Defense Council . Members of this board Insist that the present priorities system is satisfactory , but say that what is needed is an agency to check up on contract delivery dates . The present priorities system hinges on delivery dates . For instance , if a manufacturer has two contracts , both with a priority rating of " Al . " this fact does not necessarily mean that there is any confusion . The top priority rating now in use merely means " complete by the stated delivery date . " and thus two " Al " contracts would not be in conflict if one has a delivery date of December 30 and the other March 30 . The naval construction expert also revealed that large appropriations for onshore building would be requested from Congress next year to carry out a program surpassing in size anything undertaken even during the World War The development of new methods and equipment for naval warefare , he said , will require a permanent building program to take care of future changes . Public Housing Commissioner Reynolds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing programs for civilian personnel and officers , estimated that about half of the $300,000,000 of housing needed 113 the emergency would be constructed by private enterprise Mr. Reynolds warning against some " inflated prices which now prevail in industry " was made with special reference to luinber and millwork . Charging that the supply of these materials is adequate but that " retailers " are refusing to sell their stocks at a reasonable price . the Housing Commissioner told the council that consideration is being given to substituting other types of material  --  brick , steel and cinder block  --  in place of wood . He added that a shift to these materials would be made wherever possible if the present prices continue . At the same time . Mr. Reynolds reported that the Federal Works agency would soon announce a series of educational orders in an effort to determine the practicability of " demountable housing . " The use of prefabricated dwellings which later can be taken apart and moved to another location will be confined to areas where it appears that the new housing facilities will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel M. B. Birdseye , of the Army construction division , read the speech of General Hartman , who could not attend the meeting . The Army expert pointed out that the present construction program " exceeds construction or world war days " and estimated the Army 's share of defense building at about $1,147,000,000 , including about $75,890,000 for storage facilities , about $540,000,000 for housing and most of the remainder for plant expansion . He also stressed the need for a priorities system to speed up completion of orders . Both the Army officer and the Housing Commissioner reported that a large part of their requirements would be met by " central purchasing " by the Army and Works Agency rather than through buying by individual contractors . In this way , General Hartman said , the Army hopes to reduce the likelihood of excessive price rises which might result if industry were deluged by an indeterminate amount of small orders . Mr. Reynolds said that all of the plumbing and heating equipment for the housing program was being purchased in this wholesale fashion .

He stressed the need for speed in completing the defense program , declaring that increasing integration of industry will be essential . At the close of the session , a resolution by the Producers ' Council was read pledging the industry 's cooperation in the defense program and emphasizing that the companies represented on the council believe they can meet the needs of the defense program completely . The resolution contained three suggestions for better cooperation between government and industry . 1 . That the equipment manufacturers be Entormed through conferences with government officials of the demands which the defense program will place upon their particular plants in the future . 2 . Use of these conferences to adapt government desires to customary commercial specifications for equipment 3 The setting of definite delivery times in all contracts under a system of " coordinated scheduling " and a " minimum disruption to the greatly expanded private construction " business .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
