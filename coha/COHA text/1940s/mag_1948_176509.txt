The behavior of Presidential Adviser Clark Clifford had been puzzling White House newsmen for a week and a half . In view of the political debacle facing the Truman Administration , it was hard to understand how handsome Mr. Clifford could look so happy and knowing . He looked like a man who had something up his sleeve . <P> In fact , he had . He had been turning over an idea in his mind ever since last summer . At that time Air Secretary Stuart Symington had suggested that the way to handle the Russian crisis was to send Dwight Eisenhower over to talk with Stalin . That suggestion was dropped , but Clifford remembered it . He also remembered how the President had broken a deadlock over voting procedure in U.N . by sending Harry Hopkins to Moscow . From a political point of view , Eisenhower was probably not a very good choice for such a job now . But why not send Chief Justice Fred Vinson , a good Democrat , to talk to Stalin ? <P> As Clifford saw it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in man-to-nTan fashion , could get some reassuringly peaceful word out of Stalin , the whole world would cheer . It might even be the miracle needed to keep Harry Truman in the White House . Jubilantly Mr. Truman approved of the idea . <P> They would tell almost no one about it . The President would just go on the radio some evening , and make the dramatic announcement that he was sending the nation 's Chief Justice to Moscow to talk peace . <P> Unexpected Reaction . But Secretary of State Marshall had to be told . He was in Paris trying to negotiate with the Russians at the U.N . Mr. Truman sent him a letter by diplomatic pouch and told him of the great idea . <P> To Truman 's surprise and dismay , Marshall flatly opposed it . The foreign ministers of the U.S. , Britain and France had just finished eight weeks of fruitless talks with Stalin and Molotov . Marshall , at that very moment , was doing his best to reassure Britain 's Bevin and France 's Schuman of the consistency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it would not negotiate with Russia as long as she maintained the Berlin blockade . An announcement such as Mr. Truman planned would certainly shake British and French confidence in the U.S. The move would also look as though the U.S. was undercutting U.N . Moreover , what would Arthur Vandenberg and John Foster Dulles think ? Could the Administration expect the Republicans to continue support of the bipartisan foreign policy after this ? <P> Harry Truman was disappointed with Marshall 's reply . Waving his arms in the style of the new " Give ' em hell , Harry , " he paced around the White House saying : " I 've got to do something dramatic . " <P> In the end the idea was too irresistible . Marshall notwithstanding , Harry Truman decided to go ahead . <P> Politics or Business ? On his instructions , Press Secretary Charlie Ross summoned officials of the four radio networks to the White House one day last week and asked for air time for that night . Having in mind the rules of the campaign , the network officials asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Government business , said Ross . When they looked skeptical , Ross swore them to secrecy and told them of the President 's idea . They went away to think it over .
