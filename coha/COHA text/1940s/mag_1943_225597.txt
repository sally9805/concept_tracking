Nosing about on a farm some 50 miles from Johannesburg in 1938 , bright-eyed Robert Broom found the left side of a manlike skull , a mandible , the distal end of a humerus , the proximal end of an ulna , some finger bones . In 1941 Broom &; friends found part of a lower jaw . In September Broom found an anklebone . Last week there was still no evidence of murder . <P> Scottish-born , 76-year-old Dr. Broom ( TIME , Jan. 16 , 1939 ) is interested in early man , about whom he has written six books and close to 400 articles . The bones he found at the Kromdraai farm he attributes to higher primates which lived some 500,000 years ago . He sees in them " interesting affinities to man . " Broom thinks the Kromdraai ape man may be a survivor of forms out of which man sprang a million years ago . The new anklebone , small compared with the skull , leads Broom to believe that Kromdraai 's large brain would not have been required for his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Dr. Broom is Keeper of Vertebrate Paleontology &; Anthropology in Pretoria 's big Transvaal Museum . When the University of Pretoria ( whose Boer-descended students are anti-Smuts and anti-British ) set up a new medical faculty , it asked Broom to lecture on anatomy , waived the fact that he speaks no Afrikaans . He began-but then his lecturing in English was denounced by an Afrikaans-minded newspaper , the Johannesburg Transvaler . Broom thereupon addressed his medical students thus : <P> " There is not a single scientific work of any consequence written in the Afrikaans language . Today nearly all important works on science are being published in the United States-in English . ... If you prefer to confine your reading to Afrikaans , you need n't bother with science . " <P> Next day pawky Robert Broom resigned , went back to studying animals which used their brains partly for thinking .
