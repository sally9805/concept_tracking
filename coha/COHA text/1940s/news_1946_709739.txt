txt one , . two , perhaps three years of lush production and high employment for New England industry . and then the area 's crucial onomic testing - period will be here . Such is the assessment of the immediate future of the Northeast 's industrial situation by several of Boston 's top  --  economists and bankers who see New England 's testing time arriving as competition begins in earnest from other regions which possess newer buildings and more modern machinery . They emphasize the need for introduction of new capital into the area , new industries , and a greater practical , dynamic , use of the " gold mines " of research facilities here , of which it has been estimated , New Engldhd manufacturers are making only one sixth the potential use . Caution on Inertia While the stability and maturity of New England industry should be recognized along with its ability to resist shocks of extreme economic conditions , those attributes should not be confused with a glorification of inertia , which diminishes the free movements of goods , economists agree . As Nicholas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expresses it , in advancing a program for New England , " New England should be careful not tp be , blocked br held back by inertia , tradition , or a failure to use research and other facilities at our command . " A six-point program for New England spoken of by Mr. Peterson , and with which many agree , emphasizes the extensive use of research fatilities , modernization or plants and equipment . It also includes further development and extension of transportation facilities since the area depends ' so heavily on raw materials , provision of greater investments , furnishing of opportunities for youth , and placing emphasis on faith in the future rather than pride and satisfaction with the past . New Capital Needed " New England is predominately a section of small business , " Mr. Peterson continued . " The idea of mass production seems to clash with our tradition . But the ab- sence of large corporations has left a vacuum that has to be filled . " While there are outstanding exceptions , New England economy is too replete with old buildings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes for higher costs which is not good for competition . Consequently , we need a steady flow of fresh capital for expansion in new ventures . " It is believed by some that an average of $600,000,000 in capital investments should be made in the New England region each year in order to maintain a dynamic economy . Evidence accumulated this week that just such preparations for a testing period are being made . Formation of a $5,000,000 Ameri , - can Research and Development Corporation , just announced , and designed for the express purpose of stimulating new ventures through research and provision of necessary capital , is one of these signs . Talented Board Its impressive board of advisers and directors , combining men of technical experience and financial and business authorities , gives a concept of the unusual nature of the corporation . The board of advisers includes Brig . Gen. Georges F. Doriot of the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration , Dr. Karl T. Compton , Presi- dent of Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and Professors Edwin R. Gilliland and Jerome C. Hunsaker of M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention a few , includes Ralph E. Flanders , former President/ of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston , and nominated this week as Republican candidate for senator in Vermont which is tantamount to election ; Frederick S. Black-all , Jr. , President of the New England Council and a Rhode Island businessman ; Bradley Dewey , former National Rubber Director and President of Dewey &; Almy Chemical Co. in Cambridge ; and Ira Mosher of Southbridge , Mass. , formerly President and now Chairman of the Board of the National Association of Manufacturers . Mr. Flanders the current President and Treas .. urer of the new corporation . - Only recently another Boston group , identified as New Enter. ; prises , . Inc. , was formed here for ' a similar purpose . The New Eng4 land Industrial Development Corporation , established for Bev : eral years , has sponsored numerous products , among them the Vestpok razor for which the striking total of $5,000,000 in orders is now on hand , according to the N. E. I. D. C. President , Williamt L. Stoddard.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
