txt In his address at Cambridge yesterday Prime Minister Churchill took both a long and a short look into the future , and it was the short look that produced his most eloquent passages . He saw the necessity for the creation of " more efficient , more rigorous world institutions to preserve peace and to forestall the causes of future wars . " Though he did not mention Russia or China or any of the Governments in exile , he included them when he said : " In this task the strongest victorious nations must be combined , and also those who have borne the burden and heat of the day and suffered under the flail of adversity . " But what Mr. Churchill was arguing for yesterday was the continuation after the war of the present close cooperation between the American and British peoples . As he said , there was nothing like this cooperation in the last war . It is exemplified in the Italian operations , " where everything is completely intermingled , and soldiers are ordered into battle by the supreme commander or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to whether they are British , Americans or Canadians , but simply in accordance with the fighting needs . " Mr. Churchill rejects the thought of breaking up " this smooth-running and immensely powerful machinery the moment the war is over . " He thinks " we are bound to keep it working and in running order after the war , probably for a good many years , " not only until " we have set up some world arrangement to keep the peace , but until we know that it is an arrangement which will really give us that protection we must have from danger and aggression . " Whatever may be the case in the United States , he is sure that this " will not be a party question in Great Britain . " He made this proposal on a day when the prospects for the United Nations were brightening with every bit of news received : in the limited but significant operations in the South Seas ; in the swift Allied advances in Calabria : in the tremendous five-prong thrust of the Russian armies which yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is sweeping all the conquered and satellite states of Hitler 's mushroom empire . But he made it with the due warning ? and perhaps to the impatient Russians this may also be interpreted as a promise  --  that the war " is perhaps entering for us , British and Americans , upon its most severe and costly stage . " This speech may easily be distorted by our enemies and by our doubting friends . It may be argued by some that Mr. Churchill has no faith in a world order in which all nations will have a voice , and that he proposes to police the earth with an Anglo-American constabulary . It may be argued by some that he proposes to divide the world into Anglo-American and Russian or- Russo-Chinese spheres of influence . The ghosts of old jealousies and aii.spicions still ride the winds , and new ones may rise from new battlefields . But we do not believe that Mr. Churchill has in mind an Anglo-American " century , " or anything of the sort . The warm friendship and the comradelike cooperation of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent achievement of this war . It does not rule out a vaster fellowship . Indeed , if , as Mr. Churchill said , " we do not war primarily with races as such , " so no freedom-loving race or nation can justly be excluded from the peace-preserving fellowship of nations . We do not know what form the future organization of the earth 's peoples is to take . Mr. Churchill did ' not profess to know . It might be , as he said , " a world council , and under it regional or continental councils , " and it might be " a somewhat different organization " which he did not define . Whatever the form , the spirit and purpose can not be weakened by a close and continuing collaboration among the nations and dominions of the AngloAmerican world . Russia may desire specific assurances on this point . She should receive them at the rthcoming conferences . Mr. Churchill has opened up a vast and hopeful field of discussion . Down the grim corridors of war light begins to show . We must prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we " find ourselves with ' our great allies at once the masters and the servants of the future .
