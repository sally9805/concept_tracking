" Do n't forget , boys , we attack right after ITMA . " An English Guards division paused , gathered around its portable receivers to listen , then resumed the advance . <P> King George persuaded the BBC to change ITMA 's broadcast time to a later hour so as not to upset the palace dinner routine . Princess Elizabeth , on her sixteenth birthday , had the cast invited to Windsor Castle for Britain 's first and only command radio performance . <P> ITMA , Britain 's most popular radio comedy show , stands for " It 's That Man Again . " That Man is Tommy Handley , a middle-aged British radio comedian whose unabashed puns , silly syllogisms and noisy sound effects have given him a weekly radio audience that reportedly numbers 18,000,000 . Only BBC 's famed newscast has more listeners . <P> Although Americans may wonder why ( Bob Hope , who was born in England , confesses : " It 's too fast for me " ) , ITMA doubles up its British listeners . Puns like " Farewell to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soonest mended " are a Handley trademark . So are topical quips like " I have n't laughed so much since Errol Flynn captured Burma . " ITMA 's rapid-fire cacophony of explosions , whistles , popguns , yawps , quacks and trambells draws enthusiastic letters from Continental listeners , who ca n't understand English , but find the sound effects screamingly funny . <P> Can I Do You Now ? The timing , intonation and repetition which made Jerry Colonna 's " Who 's Yehudi ? " funny to U.S. audiences is a rough U.S. equivalent of ITMA 's appeal . Like Fred Allen , Jack Benny and Bob Hope , Handley has a stock set of characters who repeat nonsense lines which English listeners love to wrap into their own conversation at apt moments . A visitor to England would probably need to know ITMA to understand ordinary street , pub and Army humor . Examples : <P> Mrs. Mop the charlady repeatedly interrupts Handley to ask : " Can I do you now ? " During the bombings , people crushed under the rubble sometimes called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Two polite gentlemen on ITMA are always saying to each other : " After you , Claude " ; " After you , Cecil " - phrases which bomber pilots frequently use when circling an aerodrome . <P> A feeble old character on ITMA answers any question with the line : " I 'll have to ask me Dad , " which is now a stock retort of anyone evading a question . <P> A diver who bubbles up to the microphone signs off by saying : " I 'm going down now , sir . " Chaplains and fellow Tommies often heard the same line , said with a brave try at lightheartedness , from the wounded or dying . <P> Tommy Handley , who usually wears horn-rimmed glasses and looks like a well-domesticated business man , in starched collar , conservative tie , double-breasted suit , has been a music-hall entertainer since World War I , but did not go on the air with ITMA until July 1939 . During the war , he kidded home-front nuisances by embroiling himself with the Office of Twerps and the Ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England at peace so unbearable that he set out for the mythical island of Tomtopia , where he intends to devote his time to making things worse .
