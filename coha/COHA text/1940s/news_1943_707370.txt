txt Sanitation Commissioner William F. Carey made a frank admission yesterday , while testifying before Commissioner of Investigation William B. Herlands at a hearing ordered by Mayor Morello H. La Guardia , that he had used city employes and materials without authorization to develop Sanita Hills , the vacation resort for Department of Sanitation workers , but said he had done so in the public interest . Declaring that Sanity Hills was a model for employer-employe relations and that it had been visited and studied by industrial leaders , Commissioner Carey expressed impatience several times at being investigated for having acted as he did to prevent abanC ? - lent of the project last year after the liquidation of the Work Projects Administration , which was doing , much of the physical improvement of the 1,140 acres near Holmes , N. Y. Mr. Carey said it had been his intention from the start to reptcy the city for all municipal labor and materials out of proceeds of the department 's annual baseball games with police and firemen 's teams . As evidence of such intent he cited a payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as early as 1941 , for use of some city equipment . " Sanita Hills wo n't cost the city a red cent , " Mr. Carey asserted . " The city is getting free a property worth $1,000,000  --  and it will be worth five million before I 'm through with it . " A reminder by Mr. Herlands that public officials ' must fit their op- erations to the provisions of the City Charter caused Mr. Carey to exclaim : " Well , let them fix up their City Charter to fit the public official ! " That outburst gave the final touch of color to the picture Mr. Carey had painted of himself as an official who knew he was doing the right thing and who cut corners and slashed red tape to get it done . He had told how he and his wife had lent $105,000 , without security , to make possible continuation of work on the estate among the Taconic hills where a family of six gets the use , for $20 a week , of a comfortable cabin , with electric stove and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden coach . Mr. Carey related also how street cleaner and other Sanitation workers had put up their own money as loans of from $20 upward ? to the extent of oversubscribing a $250,000 bond issue in the full knowledge that there was no collateral ? so that their vacation resort might be developed . Despite these steps by himself and his workers , declared Mr. Carey , Sanita Hills would have faced abandonment until the end of the war when the WPA project was cut short if the breach had not been filled by the unorthodox use of city labor and materials . ? The hearings , at the Association of the Bar of the City of New York , 42 West Forty-fourth Street , Will continue today . Mr. Herlands asked Mr. Carey to bring with him this morning all payrolls and other records bearing on the city work done at Sanita Hills and said that today 's hearing would go into details on that matter . Mr. Carey said most of the records were in the possession of the City Council committee that is investigating the La Guardia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data in his own files to enable him to " bring out the details . " - . Hart Fails to Appear Councilman Walter R. Hart , Brooklyn Democrat , who heads the City Council 's investigating committee , did not attend the hearing , although Mr. Herlands had , at the Mayor 's suggestion , invited him and offered him an opportunity to examine all witnesses . Abraham J. Multer , chief assistant counsel to the Hart committee , attended the hearings . He declined Mr. Herland 's invitation to question witnesses and said he was there only as an observer . The hearings by Commissioner Herlands have been described as part of Mayor La Guardia 's stratD egy in making public the Administration 's side of every case developed by the Hart investigation , either before or right after it is brought into the open in the City Council chamber . The Hart committee has dug deeply into the Sanita Hills matter and had questioned Mr. Carey and others in private , but has not yet devoted a public hearing to , it . At last Friday 's public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had violated the City Charter by keeping his outside jobs when he became Sanitation Commissioner . He said he had told the Mayor , before accepting the appointment , that he would have to continue to look after his own business enterprises . In the matter of Sanita however , the Mayor had no foreknowledge of his Commissioner 's unorthodox operations , Mr.- Carey said yesterday . He testified that he had not discussed the use of city employes and materials : beforehand with the Mayor . Testify on Financing Other witnesses yesterday were Captain Eugene B. Sullivan , in the Army on leave from his position as law assistant to the Department of Sanitation , and Harry R. Langdon , chief of the department 's finance division . Mr. Langdon , who is also treasurer of the Welfare Honor Relief Fund of the Department of Sanitation , described the bond set-up whereby employes voluntarily put some of their earnings into the fund . A bond bought for $16 in 1941 will be redeemable in 1946 for $20 , it was explained . Mr. Langdon said departmental employes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whether they bought bonds . One of the purposes of the bond issue , according to Captain Sullivan , was to pay the city 's share of the WPA project . The payment by the welfare fund for that purpose was about $75,000 . He testified also that title to the entire development had been given to the city . Photostats of checks were introduced in evidence , showing that ' Mr. Carey and his wife , Ocean D. Carey , had made loans to the fund , between December , 1941 , and last June , totaling $105,000 . Mr. Carey identified the checks and said the money had since been repaid , at 3 per cent interest . " Just why did you lend - this money ? " asked Mr. Herlands . " I was very anxious to do something for the civil service employes to help them complete this vacation project. , " replied Mr. Carey . " I wanted to help them do something they could n't do by their individual efforts , but which we might do cooperatively . " Expects Losses for Few Years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund on several occasions " to call on me if they needed money " for Sanita . He declared he expected that Sanita Hills would run at a loss for the first few years because of the extent of the improvements , - which included cutting roads , laying water mains and drainage pipes , but that later it would be self-supporting . Declaring that he had always maintained good relations with large groups of men who had worked on his various enterprises in many parts of the world , Mr. Carey said he tried to put the same system in operation when he became head of the Department of Sanitation . He found , he said , that many of the lower salaried sanitation men could afford no more than " the bare necessities " and that their families , often large , had to spend their vacations " on the doorstep or on the street . " Sanita Hills was developed to meet just such a situation and to improve the morale and efficiency of the employes , Mr. Carey Said . As the Commissioner related it , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the municipal government . In Brazil , he said , where one of his companies is ' operating , he built a school for children in the wilderness , then he built homes for their parents and soon there was a whole town , San Jose , where before there had been nothing . " I 've been an employer for many years , " he said . " I do n't forget about my empioyes when the day 's work is done . I consider that I stand in relation to Department of Sanitation ? workers as an employer ( and that it is my function to have a continuing interest in them to make life more cheerful for them . " It is my opinion that employers in this- country are too willing to forget their employes once the whistle blows . I want to say that the employer who forgets the men when the day 's work is done is just stupid . That 's why we have labor unrest .. But that 's going to be changed . Many employers have come to Sanita to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Carey said : " In this case the City of New York has sent a few men to Sanita to completd the work left unfinished by the WPA . It is for the benefit of employes of the City of New York . So it is investigated . I do n't understand these investigations at all . They 're just nonsense . " Mr. Herlands was asked outside the hearing whether he had begun his investigation , as requested by Controller Joseph D. , of an alleged violation of the City Charter by Councilman Hart , whom Mr. charged with representing the Green Bus Line in dealings with a city agency . " In fairness to every one , I have no comment , " he said .
