Ex-Trust-Buster Thurman Arnold , now a not-too-august U.S. Court of Appeals Associate Justice , last week wiped off the dust that had gathered on his club since he left the Department of Justice , and whammed it down on the collective pate of organized labor . The blow , wrapped in the current issue of Cosmopolitan magazine , was delivered with the same kind of gusto with which he had smashed so savagely at various A.F. of L. unions ( building trades , teamsters , musicians ) as harmful monopolies . His kick upstairs to the bench brought no heartier sighs of relief from any area than from labor 's . <P> In his article ex-Buster Arnold judicially recorded his opinion that labor has become a national headache , that it is perhaps more unpopular in the slit trenches of World War II than in the posh clubs of professional New Deal haters , and that the great body of public approval essential for effective labor support is crumbling all along the line . <P> Indictment . Justice Arnold put his case against organized labor in one word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor organizations are beginning to take on the color of the old Anti-Saloon crowd in its palmy days before Repeal . They have the same kind of political and financial power to coerce government agencies , to threaten individual Congressmen and to frighten liberal critics by labeling them as opponents of a great moral cause . . . . Independent businessmen , consumers and farmers have had to sit back in enraged helplessness while labor used coercion for the following purposes : Price control , eliminating cheap methods of distribution , creating local trade barriers by restricting the use of materials made outside the state , preventing organization of new firms , eliminating small competitors and owner-operators , preventing the efficient use of machines and materials , retarding the efficient use of labor , limiting the work done , requiring that the employer pay for no work at all . <P> " Labor unions have exploited labor itself in the following ways : the refusal of one local to honor membership of another local of the same union , requiring workmen to pay dues to a large number of unions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their choice , compelling employers to break off relations with unions certified by the National Labor Relations Board , failure to hold elections , intimidation , packing of membership to win elections , refusal to admit competent workmen to union membership . . . exorbitant charges for dues , fees , work permits , and denial of the right to membership because of race or because of personal prejudice of officials . " <P> Question &; Answer : Asking , " What is the reason for all this ? " ex-Buster Arnold gives a trust-busting answer : Says he : <P> " A certain percentage is graft and corruption , but a larger percentage is the result of the age-old struggle for economic power by men who love power . . . . Labor acquired its present extensive power as a result of a series of Supreme Court decisions. * These decisions fell like a bomb on the Department 's policy of prosecuting indefensible labor restrictions .
