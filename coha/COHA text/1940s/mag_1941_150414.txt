At top and bottom of this page are the first clear portrait ever made of individual molecules and the first detailed glimpse of a chemical reaction . Shown privately last fortnight before the American Philosophical Society ( TIME , May 5 ) , these pictures appear this week in public for the first time-released in the Journal of Biological Chemistry by Wendell Meredith Stanley and Thomas F. Anderson of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research at Princeton . The huge , self-reproducing molecules here pictured are the cause of the mosaic disease of tobacco plants - viruses similar to those which cause such human ills as smallpox , influenza , infantile paralysis . <P> The pictures were taken with an electron microscope developed by R.C.A. ( TIME , Oct. 28 ) . The photographic plates were exposed by beams of electrons instead of beams of light . Practical limit of light magnification is about 2,000 diameters , of electron beams 100,000 . These molecules are about ten-millionths of an inch long . In the picture above they are shown alone ; in the picture below , they look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with antibodies , smaller molecules which produce immunity in organisms by reacting with the larger virulent ones . It is an action shot of a battle between the forces of disease and the forces of health .
