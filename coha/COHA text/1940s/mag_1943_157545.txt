There were well over 100 newsmen present , plus a sprinkling of goggling visitors . The President was in his shirt sleeves . At first it was just like almost any other semiweekly press conference . Then a reporter remarked that there had been a lot of talk going around about the report that Chief of Staff George C. Marshall would soon get a new job . <P> This was what Franklin Roosevelt had been waiting for . Now the President rolled up his verbal shirt sleeves , whammed one segment of the U.S. press smack on the end of its nose-for-news . <P> First he read a clipping from Eleanor Patterson 's Washington Times-Herald . It was a story by dapper , opinionated William K. Hutchinson , chief of the Hearst-owned I.N.S. Washington bureau . His story 's gist : 1 ) that " a group of influential White House advisers " was conspiring to kick General Marshall upstairs " to a glorified but powerless world command over Anglo-American forces " ; 2 ) that the motive " is to use the Army 's vast production program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidential campaign . " As the President read he bore down jeeringly on the more purple key phrases . <P> Ready-Made Answer . Next he read from two New York Herald Tribune editorials . They discussed " the mixture of unauthenticated ' news , ' rumor , guesswork and innuendo which has exploded a teapot tempest around . . . General Marshall . " They labeled such speculative reporting obstructionism and " whispering gallery journalism . " <P> They accused the Washington Times-Herald and its sister papers ( Joseph Patterson 's anti-New Deal , anti-British New York Daily News and Robert McCormick 's ditto Chicago Tribune ) of being " sleepless " in their efforts " to spread disunion among the Allies . " As he read on , the President , obviously enjoying his ready-made answer , paused once to interpolate that the Herald Tribune is ( accented ) a respectable newspaper and to smile benignly at the HT 's Washington correspondent , comfortable , spectacled Bert Andrews . <P> " The best newspapermen , " read the President , " resent this sea of hint and rumor . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Patterson and McCormick newspapers are constantly doing . " <P> By adroit emphasis and inflection Franklin Roosevelt managed to turn the words of others into words of his own . And he left no doubt that he thought some U.S. newspapers have sunk to dismal depths . Not since the famed " dunce cap " and " chronic liar " press conferences had he delivered so hard a pitch . <P> Argumentum . Into the fray next day jumped the News , to bat for itself , its sister papers and the Hearst Press , to bat at the Herald Tribune . Said the News in the best Joe Patterson manner : " The President 's purpose , obviously , was double-barreled : 1 ) to intimidate all newspapers and magazines in the United States into subservience to his will ; 2 ) to further his ambition for a fourth term . "
