1 INT . GRANT 'S OFFICE - POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT FADE IN CLOSE SHOT  --  SHOOTING THROUGH a window wet with rain . CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Lieutenant Harry Grant standing in front of the window smoking  --  staring broodingly out at the rain . CAMERA CONTINUES to PULL BACK to include his side-kick , Sergeant Collins , an easy-going , philosophical man of about forty , tipped back in a chair nearby , his hat over his eyes , half dozing . Both he and Grant are well dressed . For a moment or two there is complete silence . Then Grant lights a second cigarette from the stub of the first , takes a deep drag . Collins coughs , opens his eyes , grimaces . &nbsp; COLLINSYou 're doing all the smoking , and I 'm the one getting the cough . Grant does n't answer . He has n't even heard Collins . He is preoccupied  --  lost in deep , perturbed thought . He is a good-looking man somewhere in his thirties , a little on the serious side . Collins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; COLLINSCome on , Harry  --  how about easing up ? &nbsp; HARRYI 'm all right . Collins pushes his hat back , brings the chair to rest with its four legs on the floor . &nbsp; COLLINS ( quietly ) There were plenty of rainy nights he did n't show , Harry . Grant does n't answer . He turns away from the window , steps over to a map hanging on the wall alongside his desk , studies it in deep concentration . Collins watches him , a little concerned .  --  2  --  &nbsp; COLLINSI used to know a fellow just like you , Harry  --  Lieutenant Winfield . One of the best men we ever had in Homicide  --  brooded over every case  --  lots of imagination  --  plenty on the ball . Know where it landed him ? In the bug-house .

He picks up a trench coat from a chair , hauls it on . &nbsp; HARRYI 'll be along in a few minutes . He turns away from the map , wanders over to a door leading to the Evidence Room , which adjoins his office . Collins watches him with that slightly worried look , then goes on out of the office . As he opens the door to the corridor , we catch a fleeting glimpse of the word " Homicide " painted on the door .  --  3  --  3 INT . EVIDENCE ROOM FULL SHOT . It is a medium-sized room , empty except for a table , a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting emphasizes the sombre bareness of the room . Grant comes in , wanders over to a glass case which is mounted on the table . A small sign reads : Evidence  --  " The Judge " DO N'T TOUCH 4 MED . SHOT Grant stares at the stuff in the case , his expression increasingly thoughtful . It is a motley array of objects  --  some so delicate that they are mounted on glass slides and cardboard . All have typed captions stating origin and date . Included are : a few grey hairs  --  a length of black shoo laces  --  cigarette butts  --  a grey hat  --  a torn square of blue serge  --  a broken fingernail  --  half a dozen wooden matches  --  a worn pigskin glove  --  a footprint preserved in melange . Grant slides back the glass top , flicks off an imaginary speck of dust on one or two of the objects , then picks up the pigskin glove , regards it with frustrated thoughtfulness . DISSOLVE 5 EXT . BENNY 'S CAFE - NIGHT A Neon sign which reads : " BENNY 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Benny 's " is also painted on the window . It is across the street from police headquarters and is a combination bar and coffee shop  --  a hangout for the boys who have any business around the station  --  policemen off duty , lawyers , bondsmen , members of the Press , etc . It has stopped raining , but everything is wet . Street lamps are reflected in puddles  --  raindrops dissolving in lazy rivulets on the window pane . Collins , wearing his trench coat , comes into scene from across the street , goes in.  --  4  --  6 INT . BENNY 'S FULL SHOT . The bar is at one side  --  booths on the other , where food is served by pretty waitresses . Benny , the proprietor sits at one end of the bar , near the door , chewing on a dead cigar , while he talks on the phone . He holds a scratch sheet which is marked and refers to it as he talks . Somewhere in scene , HEARD above the clatter of dishes and the buzz of conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballad .

A man , on his way out , gets in her way .  --  5  --  &nbsp; MANExcuse me , lady . He waits . Ann stops around him . He looks after her . She is worth looking at .

He sees Ann , smiles at her . He always smiles at pretty girls . 7 MED .

The man on her left watches her in the mirror . He likes the cut of her suit , and the lines that go with it . &nbsp; ANN ( to Collins ) If this Judge case gets any hotter it 'll sizzle . Collins shoots her a look , but makes no comment . The bartender places Ann 's drink in front of her . She takes a sip , muses . &nbsp; ANNFunny thing  --  calling himself " The Judge " ! Collins fishes a cigarette from his coat . &nbsp; COLLINSThe Judge is a funny guy . ( lights cigarette ) Killing people is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrigued by Ann 's hair .
