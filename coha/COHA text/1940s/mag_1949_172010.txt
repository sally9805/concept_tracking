Ricardo De Blanco , a Texan with lavish tastes and enough oil wells to gratify them , was quite pleased with the diamond-buckled gold belt which Dallas ' Linz Bros , had sold him " to wear with slacks . " But his pet grey poodle , Toto , was troubled : his unruly hair kept tumbling into his eyes . Could Linz Bros , make Toto happy , too ? It could , indeed . Last week , having fixed Toto 's bangs with a set of silver barrettes ( and a $250 diamond-studded white-gold set for Sundays ) , Linz Bros , was designing a Western-style dog collar for De Blanco 's approval . It would have ruby-studded gold and silver buckles . <P> In rich and sentimental Texas , such resourceful attention to the customer 's whims has put Linz Bros . " Jewelists " ( a copyrighted coinage ) in a class by itself . To gladden its clients ' eyes , Linz has turned out gold and platinum cowboy belt buckles , and jeweled stickpins shaped like oil derricks ( one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by tossing silver dollars on the floor ahead of the janitor 's broom ) . But such spectacular baubles are only the showy side of a solid , 72-year-old trade that grosses $2,000,000 a year . <P> Out on the Road . Linz Bros , does not wait for business to step up to its horseshoe-shaped gem counter , but goes out after it with salesmen who range all over Texas . Any Texan who strikes it rich can expect to hear from a Linz salesman about the time he buys his first Cadillac . In their modest little sample cases the salesmen might carry a fortune in jewels . To stay out of the way of thieves , they travel under assumed names , never get too clubby in the club cars , and use a code to communicate with the home office . None has ever been robbed . <P> Their gadding about follows the tradition that Joseph Linz , a St. Louis watchmaker , began when he set up shop in the railroad town of Denison , Tex . in 1877 , not long after the last big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southwest by buggy and train , sleeping in railroad stations with his head pillowed on his jewel box , while he and two other brothers-Simon and Ben-ran the store . <P> Up on the Roof . Brother Albert outlived all the rest . He was present on the day in 1899 when the shop moved to the Linz Building-a seven-story Dallas " skyscraper " with a roof garden where visitors could relax and enjoy the view. * And he was on hand in 1940 when Linz Bros , moved to its present quarters , a severely modern building a few doors from the Neiman-Marcus department store . Until his death last February , at 85 , " Mr. Albert " showed up every day to hand his customers Irish jokebooks , and horehound candy to ward off colds . Then brother Simon 's heirs stepped in-son Clifton Linz as president , son-in-law Asher Kahn as vice president . Under them , Linz 's business is 600% greater than prewar .
