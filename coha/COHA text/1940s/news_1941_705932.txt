txt ELECTRIC BOYCOTT IS HELD ILLEGAL Anti-Trust Plot Raising Costs Here Is Found by Master ? Union Will Appeal An injunction to break the boy : . cott established by Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers , A. F. of L. , against the products of eleven major electrical manufacturers was recommended yesterday by John Kirkland Clark , special master , in a report filed in Federal court . Completing a four-year study of testimony and briefs , Mr. Clark declared that a conspiracy between the union and local electrical contractors and manufacturers had added millions of dollars to the cost of public and private electrical construction projects in this city , and had closed the field not only to products made by nonunion or C. L 0 . workers but even to those manufactured by sister locals of Local 3 outside the metropolitan district . The special master depicted the A. F. of L. organization as the dominant element in this conspiracy , with contractors powerless to defy its wishes and manufacturers dependent on its favor for admission of their products to this market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guardia Anti-Injunction Act gave it immunity from prosecution under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act . Such a construction in cases where no dispute affecting wages or working conditions existed would open the way to similar boycotts in every large city and make a mockery of the whole theory of the free flow of interstate commerce , Mr. Clark ruled . Union to Fight On Undaunted by his decision , the union announced-that it was prepared to fight the case to the Supreme Court , if necessary . Hugh Morgan , acting business manager of Local 3 , characterized the Clark report as " a blow at the organized labor movement in America " and reiterated the union 's denial that it had engaged in any illegal boycott . Walter Gordon Merritt , counsel for the eleven manufacturers , including General Electric , Westinghouse and Allis-Chalmers , said the decision represented a victory for the public . Judicial sanction for the practices of Local 3 would have relegated the entire nation to " a state of economic disintegration similar to that which existed prior to the adoption of the Federal Consituation , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month before a motion for issuance of an injunction can be made on the basis of Mr. Clark 's recommendations . In his report the special master allowed the parties twenty days in which to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law , after which he will submit his own findings and conclusions to the district court for action . Appeals to // ELECTRIC BOYCOTT HELD ILLEGACPLOT // the Circuit Court and the Supreme Court are likely to put off a final determination for at least a year . If the Supreme Court decision is adverse to Local 3 , the union will be in " a sweet hole " financially , its officers admitted . Its first responsibility would be to pay the special master 's fee of $39,960 , as well as its own legal fees and all the other costs of the proceedings . After that the organization would have to prepare to meet a directed verdict in favor of the manufacturers in an action brought by them for triple damages under the Sherman act . A jury would be asked to fix the amount , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The manufacturers have estimated their loss under the triple-damage clause at $1,350,000 . In reaching his conclusion that the eleven companies were entitled to injunctive relief that would " effectively destroy " the boycott against their products , Mr. Clark took the view that the controversy under consideration did not constitute a labor dispute within the meaning of the Norris-La Guardia act . Under the Supreme Court 's decision in the Hutcheson case last February , unions are exempt from any criminal liability for violation of the Sherman Act so long as the alleged conspiracy does not extend beyond the membership of the union , Mr. Clark said , but this immunity is forfeited when the union combines with other groups to enforce a monopoly in restrain of interstate commerce . The report added that the union , by virtue of its own strength and its ability to call on the 200,000 members of unions affiliated with it through the A. F. of L. Building and Construction Trades Council , had " almost the power of life and death " over local contractors and manufacturers . According to the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promulgation of a " fair list " restricted to electrical products made in the metropolitan area by members of Local 3 . This had the effect of a " black list " with respect to all companies not included in the tabulation , Mr. Clark declared . Companies that had signed contracts with other locals of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers or that had recognized the C. I. 0 . United Electrical , Radio and Machine Workers after NLRB elections were unable to break through this boycott , the special master found . The monopoly established in behalf of manufacturers employing members of Local 3 enabled them to " raise their prices materially " over those prevailing in the open market . The cooperation of the contractors was obtained through the creation of associations that every contractor employing members of Local 3 was required to join , the report said . The contract under which they operated was known as the " voluntary code " and under its terms every contractor was obliged to file with the code committee every bid made on public or private work in this city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , including its business manager , Harry Van Arsdale Jr . The rules required the members to add 35 per cent to labor cost ' for " overhead " and 10 per cent to the cost of materials for " commission " and to " load " the bid further with at least 6 per cent for management fees , Mr. Clark declared . Any bid that fell 10 per cent below the average of all the bids submitted was subject to investigation for " pricecutting , " an offense subject to substantial fines . Mr. Clark said the companies shut out of competition here could not alter their situation through any improvement in wages , hours or working conditions for their own employes , whether A. F. of L. or C. I. 0. , and added that it was " preposterous " to assume that Congress intended to sanction such a boycott through the Norris-La Guardia Act . " If such a combination and conspiracy as has been established in this case is to be held legal and the plaintiffs should be held entitled to no right to enjoin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be but a short time before union contractors and manufacturers in Chicago , Detroit , Philadelphia and other great centers of manufacturing and building will enter into similar combinations and conspiracies and the free flow of interstate commerce in the products of such factories will cease . " He held that Local 3 had excluded some products from use altogether and had made the use of others uneconomic by insisting that they be dismantled at the factory and reassembled at the job site by members of the local union . He said the question of added cost " was one which never concerned the union , " even when relatively little work for its own members was involved . This demand for reassembling panels and other devices previously assembled at the factory was enforced in the construction work at Rockefeller Center and in various city projects , Mr. Clark said . Although it insisted on rigid adherence by contractors to all the obligations imposed on them by the union agreements , Local 3 " felt entirely free to violate its few obligations under these contracts whenever needed to demonstrate its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working , including the City of New York , " the report said . When the Board of Education gave a school contract in 1935 to a nonunion electrician the local called a strike on all public school jobs and this continued in effect until the city set aside its agreement with the nonunion contractor . Similar strikes were called or threatened in connection with highway and subway construction , according to the special master . In the union 's comment on the Clark decision Mr. Morgan said it would " bring joy to the heart of every labor-baiting corporation official in Wall Street , " but it would be received " with fear and misgivings for the future of labor by millions of working men and women throughout the country . " " Stripped of all its legal verbiage , the practical effect of the des cision will be to terrorize union officials and active union members into being docile , subservient and totally ineffective instruments for the welfare of their members , " Mr. Morgan said . The plaintiffs , in addition to General Electric , Westinghouse and Allis-Chalmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colt 's Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company , CutlerHammer , Inc. ; Electric Controller and Manufacturing Company , Monitor Controller Company , Square D Company and Trumbull Manufacturing Company .
