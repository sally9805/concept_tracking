EIGHT years ago the Museum of Modem Art in New York City the most highly publicized museum in the world ? staged a show of " Fantastic Art , Dada , and Surrealism , " and among the exhibits stood a fur-lined cup and saucer . It was set on its own pedestal like a piece of sculpture ; and near it were displayed such other " art objects " as a birdcage containing lumps of sugar , parrot food , a thermometer , and an inverted postage stamp , the whole conglomeration labeled " Why Not Sneeze ? " The cup-and-saucer ensemble tickled the fancy of headline writers , who promptly let fly with the phrase " the fur-lined-cup school of art . " It amused the dilettantes , who thought it different and chic . But it bewildered and outraged a quantity of people who had been brought up to believe the simple thesis that an art museum is a place where you find art . And today the fur-lined cup remains in the memories of many observers as an apt symbol of the Museum 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear at its beginning in 1929 , when its founders announced that its function would be " to hold a series of exhibitions . . . which shall include as complete a representation as may be possible of the great modern masters ? American and European ? from Cezanne to the present day , " and " to establish a permanent public museumwhich will acquire , from time to time , collections of the best modern works of art . " This summer the Museum of Modern Art is celebrating its fifteenth anniversary . Columns of publicity sing the triumphs and achievements of its history . Yet at the very moment of the anniversary its affairs are in crisis ; it is rent with internal conflict ; and it is forced to defend itself against increasingly bitter attacks ? against charges that its course has been over-precious and erratic , that again and again it has sponsored the fashionably odd rather than the fine , the decadent rather than the original , the spectacular rather than the sincere . That the Museum wields immense influence is undeniable . Furthermore , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a thundering success . Its dazzling modern glass-and-marble home on West 53rd Street is thronged . Its roster of officers and trustees glistens with the names of Rockefellers , Whitneys , and Fords . Its audiences range from kindergartners , for whom there is a special Young People 's Gallery , to soldiers who come in to see not only the painting exhibitions but also the occasional shows of sketches made at the front by their brothers-in-arms . There are departments devoted to photography , industrial design , modern architecture , and old-time movies . There have been displays of maps , charts , posters , and documents about the war , about postwar air communication , and about occupational therapy . Last year the attendance exceeded 350,000 persons , more than a third of the number who attended the Metropolitan Museum . What is more , those who came paid twenty-five cents to get in , while the Metropolitan is free and has twenty times the exhibition space . And most of them loved the place , charmed by its shiny newness and by the ingratiating absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They might be completely confused by the things they saw there , but they accepted them all unquestioningly , beguiled by their ingrained respect for a museum as such , by the physical impressiveness of the institution , by thesolid substance of its backers , and by the great air of authority with which its exhibitions were skillfully staged . Yet it is precisely because the Museum 's fa ? ade is so glittering and its influence upon the general public is so persuasive that its critics are so caustic in their charges that it has betrayed its trust . Said the Art Digest last summer , " Art to these amiable folk the officials and trustees is something to make fashionable conversation , finding cultural intoxication as they whiff the fragrant chi-chi flower . . . . While serious professional artists fight for the recognition that means life to them , the Modern fiddles away its resources , building a precious cult around amateurism . " In November , 1943 , Are News accused the Museum of supporting " playboys and primitivism " instead of important contemporary art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization known as American Abstract Artists picketed the Museum 's show of Italian masterpieces of the Renaissance ; and though their display of resentment at the consistent ignoring of the younger European and American abstract artists might perhaps be dismissed as a bid for attention on the part of a group of painters with a circumscribed aesthetic approach , there was no such easy answer to the blast issued only a few months ago by the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors , an organization incorporating many widely varying points of view . The Federation accused the Museum of " sacrificing seriousness of purpose for publicity " and " of proving an enervating influencerather than a stimulus to the more inventive artists of America . " All the Museum 's critics were resentful because it showed more interest , they held , in stunts like the display of a tinsel-bedecked shoeshine chair , of the doodlings of inmates of insane asylums , and of the pathetic efforts of frustrated amateurs , than it did in the significant creative work of the nation . N OR have adverse reactions been con- fined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within its own wails . The private opinions of some of its trustees have been searing . In July , 1943 , for example , A. Conger Goodyear , president of the Museum during the first ten years after its founding and now a trustee , wrote a letter to Stephen C. Clark , chairman of the Museum 's board , in which he said of a current show , " It seems to me that this exhibition is very silly , perhaps the silliest we have ever had , and that I think is saying a good deal . . . . I have acquiesced in this exhibition , but I certainly am not going to do so in the future . . . Really I think we must put a stop to it . It would be far better to have no exhibitions at all than things of this sort . . I think that together we can stop the present tendency . " The show to which Mr. Goodyear referred was the exhibition ? most elaborately staged ? of the amateur efforts of a retired Brooklyn manufacturer named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy himself in his declining years by harmless puttering with paint and canvas . The imposing sponsorship by the Museum of the innocent Hirshfield " primitives " not only was regarded with wide-eyed amazement by artists and critics but brought to a boil the long-simmering conflict over the Museum 's policy . Within two months thereafter came the bombshell announcement that Alfred H. Barr , Jr. , its director throughout its fifteen-year existence , was " retiring " in order to " devote his full time to writing the books on modern art which he has had in preparation and which his heavy directorial duties have made it impossible for him to undertake . " Mr. Barr , the announcement said , had accepted an appointment as " advisory director . " The art world was galvanized by the announcement . Barr , because of his position , had become one of the most influential figures in the field of modern American art . He had been in the driver 's seat during the Museum 's wavering course down the road which led from C6zanne to the little Brooklyn manufacturer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes and effects . What was going to happen now ? Would the Museum change its direction ? Those questions still remain only half answered . And this anniversary year seems to be an appropriate time to add to them other questions of concern to a wider public . Has the Museum really fumbled its great opportunity ? Has it failed to recognize the more inventive products of that extraordinary activity among American artists which had its genesis at approximately the time when the Museum itself was born ? And if so , why ? These are not idle questions ; they are of moment to everyone who believes that the vitality of the contemporary arts is a measure of the quality of a civilization . If we are to answer these questions , a brief examination of the origin of modern art and of the Museum 's own career will be necessary . TN THE second half of the past century there were at work in Paris a group of painters of great originality and power . Beginning in the sixties , these painters ? however they differed among themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventionality ? the insipid , illustrative realism ? of the Salon , and for the vigor of their search for new forms . The great names of this group before 1900 included Manet , Degas , C6zanne , Renoir , Van Gogh , Seurat , and Gauguin ? names now familiar and admired everywhere . After 1900 , and developing out of the work of these masters , came still another succession of artists including Matisse , Rouault , Braque , Modigliani , Chagall , and many more , of whom the greatest perhaps is the Spaniard , Pablo Picasso . In America there was no such sustained pitch of aesthetic activity . There hadbeen a very few men of exceptional talent ? Ryder , Eakins , Sargent , and Homer among them . But Ryder and Eakins were utterly neglected . Sargent frittered away his great abilities making expensive portraits of the rich . Homer ? the least imaginative among them ? achieved the greatest popular success . The principal museum in the country was the Metropolitan in New York , which was bossed by its most powerful trustee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new painting in France , but it is certain that he had neither understanding of nor respect for what the insurgents were trying to do . Despite the stifling air of this desert in which they found themselves , there were in America small groups of artists who knew what was going on abroad and were themselves infused with the same rebellious spirit . Some had visited or studied in Europe and seen at first hand the work of a revolutionary generation . But they could find practically no support here among dealers or museums . By 1911 the American rebels were so inflamed with the desire to publicize their experiments and thereby break down American art smugness that they took matters into their own hands . They raised money . They assembled pictures here and abroad . And they hired a hall ? the 69th Regiment Armory at Lexington Avenue and 25th Street . In 1913 the Armory show , of **28;168;TOOLONG fame , opened . It shocked America out of its complacency and provided the most powerful single jolt that art in this country had ever received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wealthy New York woman , Miss Lizzie Bliss . So impressed was she with what she found that she started at once that famous collection of modern French art which eventually became the nucleus of the present-day Museum of Modern Art . T N THE winter of 1928 Miss Bliss was in Egypt and there met and talked with Mrs. John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , who had also become a collector of modern art . They discussed the possibilities for an institution in New York where the great modern art of Europe which they had collected might be shown to the general public . At the time of this conversation , although C6zanne had been dead for twenty years and Van Gogh for nearly forty and both were familiar to comparatively small groups of artists and collectors , they and their contemporaries were still far from acceptable to many of the more conservative museums , dealers , collectors , and even artists . Upon their return from abroad , Mrs. Rockefeller and Miss Bliss enlisted the help of another devotee of modern art , Mrs. Cornelius Sullivan . Shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crowninshield , editor of Vanity Fair ; and Mrs. Winthrop Murray Crane , widow of the Massachusetts senator . This group became trustees of the new museum and presently they were joined by Chester Dale , Duncan Phillips , Sam A. Lewisohn , William T. Aldrich , Stephen C. Clark , and others . Most of them were or had been picture collectors . To their number as trustees they added Professor Paul J. Sachs of Harvard , sometimes known ? because of the number of museum officials appointed at his recommendation ? as the Felix Frankfurter of the American art world . To Professor Sachs the trustees applied for aid in selecting a head for the infant institution , and upon his suggestion they appointed Alfred H. Barr , Jr. , twenty-eight years old and an associate professor of art at Wellesley . Before that Mr. Barr had been an instructor in the history of art at Vassar , an assistant in fine arts at Harvard , and an instructor in art and archaeology at Princeton . Temporary quarters were taken in the Hecksher Building , at 730 Fifth Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show of the Museum of Modern Art was opened . It was a smash hit , accompanied by an outpouring of fashion comparable to that at the opening of the Metropolitan Opera House forty-five years before . And small wonder . Mrs. Rockefeller , Miss Bliss , and Mrs. Sullivan had brought to the Museum not only their money , their energy , and their time , but the use of their extraordinarily fine pictures . So had the other trustees . Many institutions in Europe had been induced to make impressive loans for the occasion . The result was such a distinguished collection of paintings by the four great ancestors , so to speak , of modern art ? C6zanne , Van Gogh , Gauguin , and Seurat ? as America had never seen before . Forty-seven thousand persons crowded the galleries in the month that the show was open . Its tremendous popular success proved that although the general public was unfamiliar with the paintings , it was a great deal more than ready for them . The years of learning and understanding of the " new art " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had originally sprung from modern art and which were now manifesting themselves in architecture , in industrial design , and in other ways had had tremendous cumulative effect . The loan of the trustees ' pictures to the Museum , and especially the eventual presentation to it of the whole Bliss collection , served , in effect , as a capital sum slowly gathered through the years and presented by an older generation to a group of young men about to embark on a hazardous but extremely promising enterprise . But bringing to an eager public the works of Europe 's modern masters was only part of the Museum 's job . More important was its duty to see that the story of these masters ' neglect by their own contemporaries was not repeated in this country . The question was what the Museum would do with that American art of the present which , stimulated by the experiments in Paris , by the artistic revolution south of the Rio Grande ( the ringleaders of which were Rivera , Orozco , Siquieros and Chariot ) , and by the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burgeon . The interested public waited with intense curiosity to see what would happen next . The masterpieces of a group of ancestors having been shown , it was assumed that the work of some of the bold spirits of the present generation would be presented next . The second Museum exhibition , " Paintings by Nineteen Living Artists , " opened December 13 , 1929 . The brilliance of the beginning quickly faded . Too many of the artists represented , however serious and proficient , were completely lacking in the fire and invention which had made the masters of forty years before so significant and rewarding . With the third show , " Painting in Paris , " the Museum got back onto comparatively safe ground , with special emphasis on the work of the great Paris moderns ? Picasso , Matisse , Derain , Braque , Rouault , and others . These men were still far from being household words in America , but they were so well established among avant-garde painters and collectors , and they had been the subject of so much published comment , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital once more . This move on the part of the Museum foreshadowed a tendency which has been apparent in its management from that day to this . The emphasis has been largely upon two elements : ( 1 ) Those Sure Things which it has inherited , and which as time has gone on have become accepted as classics by a wider and wider audience ; and ( 2 ) Those Shockers ( the fantastic , the precious , the bizarre , and the decadent ) which excite the crowd that might be called the Caf ? Society of the Arts . III PTHAT the Museum of Modern Art has done many things very well goes almost without saying . It has presented some splendid exhibitions , such as " Painting in Paris " ( the third production , mentioned above ) , the Homer-Ryder-Eakins show , the Corot-Daumier show , the Matisse retrospective show , the Picasso show , the show of " American Sources of Modern Art , " and the theater arts show , to mention only a few . Its Van Gogh exhibit of 1939 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tour of the country , helped to make that artist 's work extraordinarily popular even among the completely uninitiated , to the point where department stores were hanging Van Gogh reproductions in their show-window displays of furnishings . Its exhibit of Italian masters ? though an odd enterprise for a " modern " museum ? was well worth seeing . Its technique of exhibition has been the most ingenious and effective ever seen in this country . Many of its sub-sidiary and peripheral activities , such as its showing of old-time movies ( which the Museum maintains are a legitimate American art form ) , have merit of a sort . And they do attract the customers and help convey the impression , so neatly reinforced by the Museum 's air of dazzling intimacy , that this is a place for enjoyment . But surely the central task of such an institution , a task even more important than that of showing its Sure Things effectively , is to aid , promote , and celebrate the best contemporary art , both foreign and native : to be a force steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists , and to bring them the backing of the general public . In this task the Museum of Modern Art has failed . It has made a show of discharging its responsibility to the living by concentrating most of its attention on a handful of teacher 's pets . Those who today are actually at work in modern art ? and they are more numerous than ever , despite the depression , Hitler , and the war ? may whistle for all the help and recognition which they may expect from that gilded shrine of modernism on 53rd Street . On the occasions when the Museum has shown American art of the present , its selections have hardly been reassuring from the standpoint of either judgment or knowledge . Back in December , 1930 , when the Museum presented an exhibit called " Painting and Sculpture by Living Americans , " one critic wrote that it " had the mediocre taste of seventy-cent roast beef , " and another said that it was termed " Living Americans " to avoid the " somewhat awkward designation of ' Some Pictures We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Directors . ' " Only two years ago the Museum , in another half-hearted gesture of supporting young and serious living Americans , presented the show called " Americans 1942 : Eighteen Artists from Nine States . " This was the clearest evidence yet of uncertainty and even downright ignorance . The foreword to the exhibition catalogue referred to the artists as " a small number of painters and sculptors whose work is new to the New York public or has not been adequately represented here in recent years . " Of the eighteen artists shown , eight were familiar in New York and had been shown again and again . Of the remainder , though they were n't in the art headlines every day , one had had three one-man shows in New York during the ten-year period preceding the Modern Art exhibition . A second had had a one-man show five years before and is represented in the Whitney Museum . A third had had two one-man shows ? in 1937 and 1939 . As long ago as 1933 , when the Museum announced a one-man show of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became inescapably aware of the lack of any adequate museum measuring-stick . How could an institution which had presented " Painting in Paris " possibly see any justification for the exhibition of paintings by the proficient but uninspired American realist , Edward Hopper ? Their concern found voice in a letter which appeared in the New Republic for December 6 , 1933 . It was written by Ralph Pearson , writer and lecturer on art , and it protested the Museum 's presentation of a " naturalistic , realistic painter whose work , in its viewpoint and procedure , is the reverse of that which characterizes a modern movement . . . . The modern work , " continued Mr. Pearson , c. . definitely breaks with all transferring of actual appearances from nature to the picture ? all copying or mere reporting of facts . It recreates all data into an invention . It organizes all the material and concepts of those data into a form . ' . . . " Mr. Barr 's reply , also printed in the New Republic , was as revealing as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a popular and temporary term , and he disapproved its being transformed into " an academic and comparatively permanent label . " " Hopper is not a great colorist , " he admitted , " not a great master of pictorial composition or invention , yet many people feel that his positive , vivid realism and the evocative association of his subject matter . . . are some compensation for his lack of a passive over-emphasis upon formal design . " And finally he went on to say , distorting and limiting Mr. Pear-son 's excellent definition , " If modern artmeans only the art of formal design , " the Museum of Modern Art " will not so far as one knows become a museum of modern ' art . " From that point on , artists and art lovers at least knew what to expect from the Museum . It either did n't know what modern art was ? or did n't like it . Fr HERE has never been , of course , in any country unanimity as to which works of any period are " best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are agreed on internationally and may be recognized in a work immediately . And there are those intangibles of originality and sensibility which the experienced know wherever they encounter them . The list of modern artists who possess these intangibles but who are not possessed by the Museum of Modern Art is long . Ossip Zadkine , for instance , one of the most talented and original sculptors living today , and equally celebrated on both sides of the ocean , is not on the Museum 's roster . But there are no fewer than thirteen of Hans Arp 's " collages " and " concretions . " Nine of these were purchased by the Museum ; four were gifts ( and the question of purchase is extremely important ; nine-tenths of the Museum 's collection are gifts ) . And there are eight of Alexander Calder 's " mobiles " and " stabiles " ? arrangements of wood and metal segments that are suspended from lengths of cord and wire , to be moved by a motor or a passing breeze . The Museum does n't own an Oscar Bluemner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Burliuk , a Henry Varnum Poor , to mention a handful from among the scores of estimable artists who come to mind , but there are eighteen works by Max Ernst , the dadaist whose spongy-textured canvases have little beyond their crypticism to stimulate interest ? and of the total the Museum purchased fifteen ! Ernst 's twenty-year-old son , Jimmy , is represented in the collection , but you 'll look in vain for Milton Avery or Jean Libert6 . There is only a water color to represent George Grosz , but there are two oils by Morris Hirshfield , the manufacturer whose one-man show in 1943 created such a storm . There is no Jon Corbino but there are no fewer than sixteen of the **27;198;TOOLONG studies of Morris Graves ? all bought by the Museum . They did n't get around to buying a Feininger oil until this season , but their collection includes eight by Malevich , the Russian suprematist whose neatest demonstration of the supreme was the an angement of one white square over another white square , titled , logically , " White on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haves and have-nots and you come on some interesting findings . Question the Museum 's former director about it and the situation becomes , as Alice said , curiouser and curiouser . Asked about the plethora of Arps and Ernsts bought by the Museum , Alfred Barr replied in financial terms : " Of the eight Arps bought the total cost was $282 , the item prices ranging from $17 to $68 . Of the eleven works by Max Ernst bought by the Museum the total cost was under $750 . Half of them cost from $8 to $30 apiece . . . . It would be difficult to compute the rise in value since the purchases were made , but at a conservative guess I would say that it was about 400 or 500 per cent . I agree that we should have acquired works by Stella and Feininger years ago . . . . The Feininger , which I wanted to purchase for the Museum in 1938 , has actually gone up in value only about 50 per cent rather than 500 per cent . " Dismaying as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art-lovers , it offers an illuminating basis for comparison . On this basis , how does the Museum justify its purchase , for several thousand dollars apiece , of " Hide-and-seek , " a large fifth-rate canvas by the contemporary neo-romanticist , Tchelitchew , and of " The Eternal City , " by Peter Blume , surrealist ? How does it justify the purchase of Van Gogh 's " Starry Night " and Rousseau 's " Sleeping Gypsy " ( with money given by Mrs. Simon Guggenheim ) for over $25,000 each ? The explanation is simple . Tchelitchew and Blume are favorite sons . Van Gogh and Rousseau are practically old masters . Again we note the Museum 's preoccupation with Sure Things and Shockers . IV ) V iy these divagations and uncer- tainties of policy , to the neglect of the Museum 's primary function ? The course followed by any such institution is naturally the resultant of many forces ? conflicting interests , points of view , attitudes . The director does not rule alone . There are exhibitions committees and acquisitions committees to be taken into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustee pressure . It has been said that Stephen Clark is a friend of Edward Hopper , that Sam Lewisohn is a friend of Maurice Sterne , that Mrs. Rockefeller is a friend of Charles Sheeler , and that this may explain why Hopper , Sterne , and Sheeler are three of the few Americans to be given comprehensive one-man shows . It was Sidney Janis , a retired manufacturer turned collector , and a member of the Museum 's advisory committee , who not only suggested the Hirshfield exhibition but assembled it . It has been said that , since Nelson Rockefeller succeeded Conger Goodyear as president of the Museum in 1939 , mediocre Latin-American artists have been exhibited and purchased along with good ones not because of any illusions about their merits but because of Mr. Rockefeller 's good-neighborly plans as Coordinator of Latin-American Affairs . Yet a certain amount of partisanship is to be expected ; if a trustee believes in a painter strongly enough to buy and sponsor his work , one can understand his wanting the Museum to show it too And in any case the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the trustee pressure in the world would not fill more than a fraction of fifteen years ' exhibition time ; and a careful study of the Museum 's career reveals comparatively little trustee Iog-rolling , especially in the exhibition program . If the trustees are partly at fault for the Museum 's shortcomings , it is not because of arbitrary interference in matters of professional competence but because of acquiescence in an erratic program . The shortcomings result primarily from the Museum 's administration . To a certain extent every museum mirrors the personality and background of as a leader , only to be rebuffed by Long . ) Any institution may be lucky enough to find in its employees ' circle of intimates , or among its volunteer workers , precisely the talent that it needs ; but it is an unreliable method of recruitment , especially in an institution that may be tempted to pay too much attention to the fleeting cults and crazes of the well-bred . The need for vitality , breadth of knowledge , and breadth of view can not consistently be met on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many very generous gifts . Not only did it start its career with a rich collection in which the Bliss items alone have been estimated to be worth half a million dollars ; but the Rockefeller family gives $100,000 annually ( meeting , it is said , between 15 and 25 per cent of the operating expenses since the beginning ) , and Stephen Clark adds $50,000 more each year out of his own pocket . Even so the institution has a hard time making both ends meet . Its largest item of revenue during the fiscal year ended in June , 1943 , was membership dues , totaling $57,593 ; the next largest was admission fees , totaling $45,845 . But its operating expenses had jumped from about $124,000 in 1929 ( of which the trustees put up 87 per cent ) to about $374,000 last year ( not counting $61,000 spent on services charged to the government ) ; and its exhibition costs have been so large that despite continued large-scale financial assistance from the trustees , each year there is a cash deficit . And this without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures ! For new acquisitions the Museum must rely upon special gifts such as those generously made by Mrs. Rockefeller and Mrs. Simon Guggenheim for this purpose ? and from money gained by selling items from its permanent collection . Up to May of this year it had realized $47,389 from such sales ; and on May 11 it sold at auction , at the Parke-Bernet Galleries , thirty-eight more items ? works by Bellows , Cezanne , Delacroix , Derain , Dufy , Eilshemius , Hartley , Lachaise , Maillol , Matisse , Picasso , Redon , and others . The Museum carefully explained that " nearly all the works to be sold are closely approximated by other works by the same artist " in its collection ; that " one of the objects of the sale was to replace these with works needed to round out the collection " ; and that " no work of art by any living North or Latin-American artist " was included in the sale . In short , for lack of funds from regular sources to carry out its original intention to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best modern works of art , " the Museum is going fluid with a vengeance . That raises more insistently than ever the question of what it will buy , and whether it will at last grasp the opportunity to be a positive stimulating force in the encouragement of the most vigorous and promising art of today . RECENTLY there have been signs of a groping toward a new approach . A few months ago the Museum followed its announcement of twelve new acquisitions with a bulletin in which it went to great lengths to explain and justify these and previous purchases . Further acknowledgment of its responsibility to the general public and to artists is contained in the introduction to the Museum 's catalogue for " Art in Progress , " the exhibition which it opened late in May to celebrate its fifteenth anniversary . And yet the show itself , handsome as it is , paradoxically proves a perfect Q.E.D. for the criticism which has been leveled at the Museum . There are many great pictures and sculptures included . They are , almost without exception , either the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by living Americans whom it has hitherto almost completely ignored in its search for Shockers . And there is no more brilliant section of the exhibition than the wall given to three important borrowed canvases by Georges Rouault , whose paintings the Museum has never presented in a one-man show . Perhaps the current exhibition is the Museum 's face-saving admission of its awareness of its shortcomings . Future presentations will prove whether it has at last become truly conscious of the importance of the real job to be done , and resolute to do it .
