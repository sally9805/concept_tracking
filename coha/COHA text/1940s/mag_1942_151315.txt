" There are many competent physicians in the United States who have come to our shores as refugees . Many of these could be made immediately available for service in areas where the shortage is acute , if they could be licensed to practice . We should consider the possibility of combining self-interest with hospitality and giving all these doctors who are qualified an opportunity to help meet the growing shortage of medical personnel . " <P> Thus last week in the Journal of the <P> American Medical Association , Surgeon General Thomas Parran stated bald facts about one of the most ticklish topics in medical circles-the question of licensing refugee doctors . <P> Of some 6,000 doctors who have fled from Hitler 's Europe to the U.S. , 3.500 have been licensed to practice . A few are eminent research men like the University of Chicago 's Rudolf Schindler , University of Pennsylvania 's Fritz Lewy , Bacteriologist Ernest Witebsky of Buffalo . But most have forsaken their specialties to become hard-working general practitioners-often in doctorless farming communities . <P> Because doctors are so badly needed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the life of their new home towns . Sometimes doctors are wanted so much that a village will pay a refugee 's expenses to settle there . One town meeting in New England voted $600 to settle a refugee doctor in their town , only to have the State Medical Board refuse him a license , though he was qualified to practice in New York . <P> Many of the 2,000 qualified but unlicensed refugees have had similar experiences . Thirty-nine States have laws or rulings of their State medical boards which virtually bar foreign-born or foreign-trained physicians . Some will license a foreign graduate only after he has repeated his studies in this country . And last month the National Board of Medical Examiners ( whose standard examinations qualify for licenses in 43 States , the District of Columbia and four Territories ) ruled that it would examine only graduates of U.S. schools . <P> A principal ( though seldom-stated ) reason for these rulings is the fear of U.S. doctors that they will be faced with foreign competition . If designed merely as necessary precautions against quacks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their chief result has been that , while the U.S. desperately needs doctors for military and civilian service-particularly in rural communities-trained physicians are idle or working as elevator boys , male nurses , salesmen . To such unshingled doctors-and to those who need them-the Surgeon General 's words brought a new hope . <P> The Journal of the American Medical Association reported last week that in 1941 U.S. hospital facilities increased by 98,136 beds , more than three times the annual increase for any other year in history . Reasons : more service hospitals , more civilian money for medical care . <P> Hospitals , according to the report , were more efficient too , hustled patients out in an average of twelve days , two days less than the average hospital stay in 1935 . Estimated savings through speedup : $85,000,000.
