txt On the first test of its attitude toward revamping the Wages and Hours and the National Labor Relations Acts the House voted overwhelmingly today against an increase in travel funds for the Labor Department , which would be used in part by the Wages and Hours Administration . The vote was 126 to 76 against an amendment offered by Representative Mary T. Norton of New Jersey , chairman of the Labor Committee . Several speakers asserted that there should be no great expansion in the Wages and Hours Division until Congress had considered pending amendments to the act . The vote also was construed as representative of the House 's attitude toward the Labor Board 's requests for funds , which wer trimmed sharply by the House Appropriations Committee . Mrs. Norton 's amendment sought to add $140,000 to the Labor Department travel item , but it became the center of a pitched fight between the group headed by Mrs. Norton and that led by Representative Howard Smith of Virginia , chairman of the committee investigating the NLRB .

At adjournment time the House had reached the section dealing with the Wages and Hours Administration , which has protested that the $5,105,000 allowed by the Appropriations Committee was not enough to enable it to enforce the law . The division received for the current year $3,461,200 . The Appropriations Committee approved an increase for next year of $1,643 , - 800 . This was $1,080,000 under the budget estimate . Mrs. Norton said the Appropriations Committee 's reductions below budget estimates would interfere with enforcement of the law , and that the reduction was an attempt of its enemies to do indirectly what they had been unable to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staging a " sit-down strike " on amenVaents to the Wages and Hours Act , Representative Frank B. Keefe of Wisconsin contended that the " strike " had been going on for more than a year , despite the admission by officials of the Wages and Hours Division that changes in the act were desirable . Representative Malcolm C. Tar ver of Georgia , in charg ? of the bill , defended the committee in reducing the items for the Wages and Hours Division and termed as " propaganda " statements by officials of that agency thai to deny it $1,080 , - 000 more would mean the discharge of some employes .

" This board supplies its own professional witness on an annual basis at the expense of the taxpayers , Mr. Smith said . He stated that in the Inland Steel Company case- there was " no dispute and no case before the board , " but that the board sent Nathan Witt , its secretary , to Pittsburgh to confer with the C. I. 0 . to " see how the Labor Board could get in the case . " Mr. Smith said Mr. Witt advised the C. I. 0 . to demand a written contract so that in the event the Inland Steel Company refused the board could go into the case . " They ( the board ) had their lawyer in Chicago prepare the case , " Mr. Smith said , " so that they could proceed at once when this trap was sprung on Inland Steel . Then they put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to why the law could be construed to require a written contract . That 's been going on right along . " Mr. Smith read from writings attributed to Mr. Saposs in order , he said , that the House could decide whether he was the proper . person to have , in a policy making position . NYA Director Is Attacked Aubrey Williams , director of the National Youth Administration ; was criticized by Representative Fish of New York . " I am not charging that he is a Communist , " Mr. Fish said , " but I believe him to be one of the pinkest of men . He is not a liberal in any respect whatsoever . He is a highly intelligent man , but I am not sure but what some of these highly intelligent men are not more dangerous than the reds . " Representative Taber of New York also attacked Mr. Williams . Representatives Tarver and Keefe defended the NYA director , the former declaring he had been impressed by Mr. Williams 's attitude toward the Appropriations Committee .

" This was during criticism by Mr. Taber of a $3,500 item allowed by the NYA for expenses of auditions of young . - musicians who. sought places on-Mr . Stokowski 's orchestra . Mr. Taber inquired if any one knew who was financing the orchestra and its tour . He was forced to the conclusion , he said , that " a government agency or a foreign power were putting up " part of the money . It was brought out there had been reports that Walt Disney was financing the tour . Mr. Cot asked if *Mr . Taber was saying the Federal Government was putting up the money " for a Communist propaganda tour of South America .

" I would like to , ask the gentleman if he considers it also subversive ' that Mr. Stokowski plays the music of Bath , Beethoven , Brahms , Strauss , Wagner and - Verdi ? " Harvey.W . Brown , president of the International Association of Machinists , said in a letter to ' members of - Congress today that the proposed reduction in appropriations for the NLRB and the .

Although he had felt that the Garrison proposal might help bring the warring factions of labor together , Mr. Murdock said ; he had , given it further consideration and . had decided that the idea would " destroy the act . " Such a course , he said , would conflict with Section .9 ( c ) of the act , which makes it the duty of the board . to determine the appropriate unit of bargaining before an election can be held . Another effect , he stated , would be a clash with Section 8 ( 5 ) , under which proceedings are taken against employers for refusing to bargain collectively . Under this section the appropriate unit must first be determined . Contracts which may be made by employers with minorities might be " frozen , " according to Mr. Murdock , and thus a majority might be compelled to join a minority . Moreover , under such an amendment , Mr. Murdock said , the Labor Board would be prevented from proceeding under Section 8 ( 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus an employer might be able to make a closed shop agreement with a minority group . To decide if a closed shop is valid , he explained , the proper bargaining unit must be established , and before this can be known it must be ascertained which group is the legal majority . The House Labor Committee will meet again tomorrow .
