Last week found the U.S. again in the season when scientists come out of their laboratories , blink , stretch and bustle off to share with the world their newest findings . Some of the more newsworthy disclosures at two noteworthy science meetings : <P> Chemists . Last week some 3,000 academic and industrial members of the American Chemical Society met in St. Louis . <P> An unusual scientific group , since roughly three-fourths are engaged in business rather than in universities , it found its tongues partly tied this year because a number of new chemical developments are defense secrets . <P> &gt; How chemical analysis , often a tedious process , can be greatly speeded and simplified by a new method developed in Europe was described by Czech Refugee Alois Langer . Every element and compound conducts electricity through a solution at a distinctive voltage . To find the amount of copper in a solution , the chemist tunes in an electric meter to the known voltage of copper , measures the proportionate amount of current passing through the solution . Complex organic molecules like vitamins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt; A plastic which softens and purifies water for home or industrial use far more efficiently than the silicates now commonly used was announced by Robert James Myers of Resinous Products &; Chemical Co. of Philadelphia . Made of resin , this plastic is the first whose chemical , rather than physical , properties are employed . <P> &gt; From dark , cheap , undesirable tobacco leaves William Turner and Gabriel Goldstein of Columbia University inexpensively removed the desirable tobacco fragrance . This can then be put into the mild , golden leaves with little fragrance now favored by tobacco buyers . Mild leaves now require a factory flavoring of coumarin ( from sweet clover ) and vanillin . The two chemists predict that cigarets will soon have a genuine tobacco flavor-provided the public likes them that way . <P> &gt; " Mule feed " - pressed cotton seeds eaten only by the hungriest mules-can be combined with carbolic-acid derivatives to form a new plastic , reported Fritz Rosenthal of the University of Tennessee . <P> Notable use which he foresees : it may be molded into rifle stocks ( now largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factories . <P> &gt; Industrial chemists gasped as Edward Ray Weidlein , chemical priorities director for OPM , observed : " The entire military activities of Germany and Italy , plus the industrial and other activities of these countries and of the occupied areas of Western Europe , are being carried on with an amount of petroleum plus synthetic products which is only about 5% of our present domestic production . " <P> &gt; Several scientists protested that the U.S. people are now becoming foolish vitamin cranks . Said Conrad Arnold Elvehjem of the University of Wisconsin : " The safest program ... is to rely upon the common foods we have been . . . eating rather than attempting the production of cheap , synthetic substitutes. *
