" We 're big shots now , " says Mr. Tobe Deutschmann of Canton , Mass . " But they still send us supplies C.O.D. , and I let ' em come that way just to remind myself that I 'm not any different now than when this place never even had a drinking fountain . " <P> Tobe 's business , which he likes to describe as " the removal of electrical garbage " ( noise suppressers to the layman ) was never able to support drinking fountains in its old red-brick factory until war came along . Now it 's terrific-and a prime example of how a little businessman with unbridled enthusiasm and pixie screwball-ishness can capitalize 14 years of struggle and adversity to make himself invaluable to the war effort . <P> Tobe talked himself into the radio business on a shoestring after the last war , made $68,000 in 1927 on condensers . But that year an engineer showed him how a filter would eliminate static-and since then Tobe has n't been interested in anything else . " Everybody was making condensers , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I figure you have no right to be in business and make a profit unless you offer a service . " <P> Trouble was , nobody much wanted him to render his service . Since Tobe 's noise suppressers go on everything but the radio , he had to try to sell vacuum-cleaner and hair-dryer and clock and fan and telephone manufacturers on adding it to their products . In the depression most of them had enough trouble as it was , without monkeying with a radio silencer no one had ever heard of . <P> By 1936 Tobe Deutschmann Co. was down to 40 workers ( " all engineers and no workmen " ) , from 200 in 1928 . His machinery was rusting , the floors sagging , windows broken , ceilings cobwebbed . Grass grew in the driveway that led to the Rising Sun Stove Polish factory he bought in plush ' 28 . Tobe 's engineers became expert in repairing broken-down equipment with bailing wire and tweezers . The only way they kept alive at all was on small specialty jobs ? ike keeping the tenants from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio static , whose source they finally traced to the thermostat in a goldfish bowl . But they learned as much about static as anyone else in the U.S. <P> " Then , " says Tobe-who looks like a small version of Jimmy Durante , with milder features but just as frenzied a manner- " blood money came along . " Tanks , jeeps , etc. , with two-way radios had to have noise filters , and the ones available elsewhere were bulky and expensive . Tobe barged into the Signal Corps laboratory at Fort Monmouth , NJ. early in 1940 to try for some business . More to get rid of him than anything else , the Major in charge gave him the toughest problem he had : to make a practical filter for a Diesel generator that so far had rendered useless the radio that had to go in the same car . In two months , Tobe 's engineers had the thing licked , and before long they had gone on to develop a new filter for Army cars that cut the old cost from $80 to $15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saved time , metal , labor .
