The University of Washington 's Huskies seemed to belie their nickname . They were the tallest and skinniest of eleven crews that lined up at Poughkeepsie last week for the big race . Said shrewd Coach Al Ulbrickson : " As long as my crew averages 6 ft. 3 , I never worry about weight . " He found plenty of other things to worry about . <P> For example , his freshmen crew won their race . Ulbrickson regarded that as bad-might give them big heads and a tendency to loaf next year . When his junior varsity won the next race , Al said : " I 'd feel more confident if we 'd dropped one of them . By the law of averages it 's just impossible to sweep all three races . " Furthermore , Ulbrickson had lately observed that his varsity oarsmen had n't been rowing up to snuff . He did n't like that either . <P> Just after 7 p.m. , his moody beanpoles jockeyed their shell out into the Hudson . The coxswain dropped his arm , signaling to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they dug furiously to get headway , then settled down to a smooth 30 strokes a minute . <P> Easy Beat . Pennsylvania 's crew , hitting up an energetic 36 , flashed out in front . Cornell was right behind . Ulbrickson 's long-armed , long-legged men were using a lot less energy and staying very close . At the mile mark , still doing a smooth 30 , Washington was in the lead . Navy 's beef-trust crew was up to 34 and not gaining an inch . After two miles , the Huskies stepped up their beat a little and pulled away to win easily by 2 lengths . California , an old rival , was second . <P> Washington had swept the river for the third time , a trick they first turned in 1936 , the year they went on to become Olympic champions . Ulbrickson 's boys had a way of shining brightest in an Olympic year . <P> Dangerous Rival . The Olympic rival that Ulbrickson worried most about was Harvard , which had its own private " sweep " last week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Harvard set a new course record on Connecticut 's Thames River to whip Yale for the tenth year in a row . This week , on Princeton 's Carnegie Lake , N.J. , the Huskies will face Harvard , Yale and eight other crews to determine who will row for the U.S. in the London Olympic games . <P> <P> * As are the crews of California , Yale , Princeton , Columbia , Cornell , M.I.T. , Pennsylvania , Wisconsin , and Rutgers.
