The more science looks at solid matter , the less solid it looks . Physicists decided long ago that matter was mostly emptiness , with atomic nuclei scattered thinly through it like stars in space and electrons orbiting around them . Last week , Dr. Robert L. Thornton of the University of California reported that even the nuclei are not very solid . <P> Physicists at Berkeley , said Thornton , had shot high energy ( 100,000,000 electron-volt ) neutrons and protons through carbon and other elements . Knowing the size and number of the nuclei , they could calculate how many particles should pass through the material without hitting any nuclei . More came through than the calculations had allowed for , and with hardly any loss of energy-indicating that the nuclei are not nearly so solid as supposed . It was enough to make nonscientists nervous .
