Captain James Roosevelt , observer extraordinary , showed up in Cairo last week , looking a little peaked and touched with the popular complaint known as Gyppie ( for Egyptian ) Tummy-a light form of dysentery . Part of his peakedness came from the fact that he had just been on a remarkable desert march and had his baptism of fire . <P> He had gone along to have a look at the Iraq situation . The British had decided to get the pro-Axis revolt there in hand while the invasion of Crete gave them a breather on Middle Eastern mainlands . A trek of hundreds of British trucks , armored cars and mechanized guns , and thousands of Indian and Arab levies set out from the Mediterranean coast for Middle Iraq , to relieve the besieged airport of Habbania . The last 400 miles was across waterless , roadless wastes . <P> Observer Roosevelt went along . Just as his car was approaching the airport , four Messerschmitts appeared and went to work . James Roosevelt was frank to admit later that he did not like his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the car , he said , " faster than I ever got out of anything in my life . " In 130-degree heat , which made the metal of motorized units untouchable , the British broke the Iraqi siege of Habbania and drove them right to Feluja on the Euphrates River . There the Iraqi picked positions across the river from the British and dominating the only good bridge leading to Bagdad , 40 miles farther along . <P> At dawn next day , the British dropped Arabic proclamations asking the Iraqi to surrender at once-or else . After a few minutes the British applied the or else . It consisted of a severe bombing assault , a hail of artillery , and three ground attacks-one straight across the bridge , one which crossed the river farther up , and an airborne assault which landed in the desert behind the Iraqi , cutting off their retreat to Bagdad . By week 's end , with the help of Curtiss P-40 Tomahawks ( fighters ) and Martin 1675 ( bombers ) , the British had the situation well enough in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister were reported to have requested visas to flee to Turkey . Incidentally , in the first dogfight between a Curtiss P-40 and a Messerschmitt , the German was shot down . <P> Oil . But the British were not overly sanguine . They thought El-Gailani 's troops might withdraw to the north of Iraq , to the area which makes hot and barren Iraq so worthy of a scrap : the oil fields around Mosul . Last week London reported that strong forces of German airborne troops , complemented with bombers and fighters , had made their way across Syria and were well established in the oil-bearing area . <P> Germany 's total output of oil products , including both imports and synthetic production , is thought to equal only 5% of U.S. production of crude oil , though no one knows exactly how much synthetic fuel she produces . In synthesis , it is easiest to produce gasoline ( composed of lighter , simpler molecules ) , harder to produce fuel oil , hardest to produce lubricating oils and greases . For this reason , while Germany is moderately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately short of the heavier oils . This would explain her eagerness to lay hands on every possible field of natural petroleum .
