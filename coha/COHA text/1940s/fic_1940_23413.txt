TABLE FOR ONE A STORY BY FRANCES TAYLOR PATTERSON I GAVE the salesgirl the address to which the bath towels and pillow cases were to be sent . Maybe I should have ordered sheets too , but what was the use of getting more sheets when I did n't have any more beds ? I was really too hungry to wrestle with the problem . I 'd have to have some lunch first . Three people coming to visit you all at once is n't a coincidence , it 's a calamity . Especially when you have only one extra bed . I crossed the street to Markham 's . The food there is delicious and the place is n't too crowded . Usually you can get a table to yourself . To-day I needed to be alone  --  to think . " Table for one , " I murmured to the hostess . She led me to a nice secluded corner . I scanned the menu but I could n't seem to concentrate on food . The simplest thing would be to write or wire them not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in years . Why did they have to be in such a wild hurry to see me now ? I could tell each one that the other had asked first ; but it would n't be true . The funny thing was the letters had all come at once . I gave the waitress my order absentmindedly . How was Henry going to take this invasion of females ? I was so absorbed I did n't notice the hostess bearing down on me until she said : " You wo n't mind if I put someone at your table , will you ? We 've suddenlygot so crowded , I 'm afraid it 's the only place left . " I could hardly say I did mind with the " someone " standing right there at her elbow , a dour-looking individual at that . She had an umbrella clutched , not by the handle but in the middle , as if it were a shillalah . The British Isles , I decided quickly ; she 's learned to distrust the weather . It was a grand sunny day , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and follow her right up to the table . With elaborate preparedness she laid the umbrella across her chair , toward the back , and proceeded to sit on it . Then she told the girl to bring her some stew with dumplings and a pot of China tea . " A china pot of tea ? " the girl queried . " Na , na , " the woman said , " China tea , I want , not Injia tea , and two bails to the pot . " " We only have Ceylon and Oolong . " " The Oolong is China tea , " I interrupted . " Ceylon is India tea . " " And some scones , " the woman said . " We do n't carry scones . " The woman looked at me puzzled . " Carry ? " " She means there are no scones , but they have what they call crescents ; they are like crumpets . " . " Oh , quite . " " Do you want them ? " the girl asked crossly . " Quite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman say what she wanted in the first place ? The woman looked at me and sighed . " They make it sac difficult , a simple thing like tea . " I had narrowed my first guess of the British Isles specifically to Scotland . There was no mistaking the broad burr of her speech . " I 'm afeard I should hae waited for a table by m'sel ' . Bread to bread is nae kitchen . " " What ? " " It 's a saying we have back home . It means there 's nae enjoyment where individuals of only one sex associate . Kitchen is anything eaten with bread or potatoes to give a relish . I could see ye looked put oot when first I sat me doun . " " Oh , no , I looked put out before you came . About something else . " And then I told her , I do n't know why except that it was so terribly on my mind , that a lot of friends I had n't seen in years had suddenly made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time . The woman 's face grew very serious . Her eyes darkened . " Nae wonder ye 're put oot . It 's a bad thing entirely . " " It is annoying . Especially when there 's only one guest room and they 're all strangers to one another . " The woman looked more solemn than ever . " You mean nane o ' them ken the ithers were a-coomin ? " I shook my head . " It fair gives me the creeps . It do for sure . " " Oh , it 's not as serious as all that , " I laughed . " Nae serious ? The mark o ' death ? " I stopped laughing . " What do you mean ? " " Did ye never hear tell of it ? In the auld country ' t is a common thing . When death puts a sign on a body the knowledge goes out over the wind and the water , and the friends that love a body pick up the knowledge without their ken . They do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles andthe distance to meet and greet a body  --  before it 's too late . " " Good heavens ! What a grim interpretation to put on the nuisance of friends barging into town at the same time . " " ' T is not my own idea . Up in the Highlands " ? she pronounced it " Heelands " ? " that was my faither 's country , they always said it followed as sure as the heather bursts from the bud . " " I do n't like it , " I said . " It 's grue-some . " The Scotch woman smiled . She had a nice smile . Her face was so rugged that her cheekbones were like high tors . When she smiled it was like sun breaking out over the moors . " Ye needna take it for gospel . I didna mean to upset ye . My own mither was forever pooh-poohing the idea . She 'd get into a fair funk at faither for putting a lot of Heeland nonsense into our heads . She was a Lowlander herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist is that thick it gets into a body 's head , and they ca n't see clear again forever after . I never knew one of them yet , ' she 'd say , looking at faither , ' that was n't away in his mind . ' T is in the clouds they are . But us Lowlanders now , we 've got our feet firm in the soil . ' " ' In the bog , ye mean , ' faither 'd say . Ye 're sae mired doun ye can naither soar na light . But the bairns , they 're different . They 've got on them the breath of the wind out of Fingal 's Cave . They 've got in their ears the wild things the waves be sayin ' as they break over the stormy Hebrides . ' " ' What is it they say , faither ? ' I asked him one day . ' I hear naethin ' . ' " ' Listen , woman , then , for God 's sake . ' He 'd called me ' woman ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T was then I first started to listen . All that winter I listened . " She paused and seemed to be looking off into space , as if she were listening now to waves beating on some far island , like Lindisfarne . I pulled myself up sharply . The woman was probably herself a bit away in the mind . It was just as well not to get too involved . I attacked my Iamb chop . " All that winter , " the Scotch woman went on , " the kindred came to see us . It must be a lean year at home , ' mither joked , ' they 're coomin ' like swallows . ' Some of them came from as far away as the Border . ' T was toward the end of the winter , when the ice was breaking up in Moray Firth , that He came , the last of the kinsfolk . " " Who ? " I said . " Need ye be askin ' ? Who but Death that 's kin to us all ? " I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fakir trying to put on a show for me I might as well let her know I was n't impressed . The look was entirely lost . She was paying no attention to me . It was as if I were n't there at all . She was back with the thawing ice of the Firth of Moray . " Ah , well , " she said at last and smiled the nice homespun smile , " it 's nae guid to listen too much . After mither went I was sore afeard . ' Let the Heelanders have their daft notions , ' I said to myself , hold fast to the feel of the peat and the warmth of it , and nae let the smoke cloud m'eycs till I be seem ' things that are na there . ' " She poured herself a fresh cup of the wickedly strong tea . " I 'll trouble ye to pass the milk jug . " I handed her the cream . It was a relief to be back on safe ground with food again . Of one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , but she was sincere . Belief in the things she was saying was in her voice and in her eyes . " But ' t was na use nae to listen , " she went on after she had sipped a little of her tea . " It will coom , if it will coom . Last time ' t was a dream . " " Well of course we all have queer dreams , " I said . " Most of them can be explained scientifically , by mental telepathy , or psychoanalysis or something . They do n't mean anything . Or rather they do mean something , but not the ill omens that people used to think they meant . " " I dreamed I was going to die , " the Scotch woman went on . " ' T was to be in a motor accident . I dreamed the day and the hour . It was sae clear , I got up from m'bed and wrote it down . May 21 , 1938 , it was to be , at four o'clock in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date was reassuringly in the past . " At least that time your leprechauns and fairy fey guessed wrong . " The woman shook her head . " Na , na . They were nae wrong . " My heavens ! Was the woman trying to tell me she was dead ? For a ghastly second , staring at the weird look on her face , I had a terrible feeling that she was going to vanish . I could imagine the hostess coming up and saying : " Do you mind if I put someone at your table ? " And sure enough there I 'd be , all alone . My eyes took a hasty inventory , so that if it happened I 'd have some tangible evidence to cling to . I thought , with relief , of the umbrella . Even a ghost could n't disappear with a large cotton umbrella . Or maybe this one could , riding it like a broomstick . Anyway the half-finished cup of tea and untidy bits of " scone " would have to remain . There was also the lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was still there , as big as life . " Na , " she was saying , " they were nae wrong . Naither were they right . That day ne'er a step did I budge from the house , I was that careful . But when four o'clock coom and naethin ' untoward , I laughed at m'sel ' for a superstitious auld fool . That May 21st was a hot day , if you remember . The danger by , I went out to catch a breath o ' air . Nary a breeze was stirring . The paper boy had thrown in the paper on the walk . I stepped down to pick it up , thinkin ' to use it for a fan . Our house is on a corner and a deal of rhododendron hides the yard from the street . Well , no sooner had I stepped down from the porch than a motor coom charging out of them rhododendron like a bat out o ' hell . " " How terrible ! " " Aye , it was terrible , We heard afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had coom round the corner unbeknownst . ' T was too quick a turn , and the motor came tearing through our bushes . Poor things , they have n't been the same since . " " But what about you ? " The Scotch woman smiled her Skyey smile . " I 'm like the bushes , mended maybe , but nae the same as I was before . I 've been oot of the nursing home only this little while . It took me the better part of a year to recover . But lucky I am to be here . " Then her eyes fell on my plate . " Dear , dear , I 'm afcard I 've spoiled yer lunch wi ' blithrin ' . Ye 've let yer mutton get cauld . " " Oh , that 's all right . I was n't very hungry . " " I dinna ken how I coom to say all this . But when ye started in tellin ' me aboot the friends that have been coomin ' after ye , that ye have n't seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they say in the Heelands . I should hae held m ' tongue . " I smiled , a consciously bright and practical smile . " I 'm not a superstitious person , you know . Americans are pretty sensible . It takes more than old wives ' tales to upset us . You see , " I smiled again , " we have n't any mist blowing in from the Hebrides . " " I 'm verra glad to hear it . Ye 're a nice girrul , and I wouldna want to be-lieve that Heeland nonsense could touch ye . When all 's said and done , there 's only three o ' them a-coomin ' . If ' t was true I doot there 'd be more . " She poured herself another cup of the dark brew . I picked up my check and said good-by kindly . Is n't there something about being good to the feebleminded , since they are supposed to be holy , having been touched by God ? My own mental balance , once I was out of the Hebrides storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself regal-ing Henry with the whole story at dinner . Good old Henry . There was no " Heeland " fog about him . The cashier handed me my change . There were some nickels among the coins she gave me . My eyes sought the telephone booth . Why wait until to-night to talk to Henry ? It would be nice to talk to him right now . I 'd say : " I 'm putting a call through to Reality . " He 'd laugh , willing to be Reality . What he actually said was : " I 'm glad you called . I 've been trying to get you all morning . I had a cable from your Uncle John . He sent it here to the bank . He was n't sure but what we had moved . He 's coming through New York on his way to the Coast and he wants to see you . " " Send a cable right back saying he ca n't , " I snapped . " Why ? " Henry asked , surprise sticking out all over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town , because we 're going away . " " How do you know we arc ? You have n't even asked me what day he lands . " " I do n't care what day it is . We 'll be out of town . " " Whatever has got into you , Towser , turning on your old Uncle Jahn like that ? I thought you 'd be crazy to see him . " " Do n't you say ' crazy ' to me . " " All right , all right . But you are acting kind of queer , you know , when you have n't seen him in years . " " I wo n't have them coming like swallows . " I said . " I wo n't . " " Swallows ? Who like swallows ? " " Oh , do n't bother me . Send him a cable not to come . " " Good old Towser . Nice Towser . Down , Towser . " I slammed up the ' phone and went home . I had lost my appetite for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be no kindred " a-coomin " !
