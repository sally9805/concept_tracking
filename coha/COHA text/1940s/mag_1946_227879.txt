In recent weeks the six-month strike at the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Co. ' s big plant in West Allis , Wis. had worn thin. * A back-to-work campaign had drawn about 3,000 of the approximately 10,000 workers into the plant , past the small groups of pickets of the Communist-led Local 248 of the C.I.O. United Automobile Workers . A-C 's up-from-office-boy President Walter Geist ( TIME , June 10 ) was winning with his strategy of playing for time . ( Strikes in five other Allis-Chalmers plants had been settled with the hallowed 18 wage increase , but without the union shop which Local 248 insists on . ) <P> Last week , after A-C had again broken off negotiations , Local 248 's President Robert Buse ( a crony of many an avowed Communist in Wisconsin ) tried a desperate maneuver . Violating a court injunction , he threw about 800 pickets in massed formation in front of some of the plant 's gates . The stage was set for violence . On four afternoons pickets and cops stood toe-to-toe and slugged it out . Clothes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,000 people , many of them high-school kids , came out to the Milwaukee suburb and joined in the fray ; many of them threw rocks , tomatoes , oranges and paint bombs at pickets , workers and cops alike . <P> Violence was a two-way strategy . For the union it stirred another move by Labor Secretary Lew Schwellenbach to bring union and company together this week . For Walter Geist , who is evidently determined to break Local 248 's grip on the plant , it gave accent to his contention of " irresponsible leadership " in the union . One of the sourest labor disputes in the country had gone bitter again . <P> <P> *Among current strikes , it is the nation 's third longest . The strike at J. I. Case Co. ' s plant in nearby Racine is four months older ; that of Mack Truck Manufacturing Corp . workers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania is three days older .
