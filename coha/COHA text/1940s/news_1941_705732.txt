txt Secretary Knox , it was learned today , told the Senate Naval Affairs Committee on Friday that the United States had no agreement , with the British for joint naval action in the Atlantic and that no American warship had even entered the combat zones as now defined by . President Roosevelt . The areas patrolled had extended far beyond their original boun -- daries , the Secretary was reported , as saying , but at least until last week , when he testified , the Navy was merely following a policy of " patrol . " This did not mean , Mr. Knox I was said to have added , that the United States would not protect its ships going to Iceland , just as it would protect them going to South America . If any ships en route to Iceland with supplies for the American Army of Occupation were refused passage , he added , the United States Navy would " know how to act . " But he testified that he did not anticipate any trouble in this regard , since the Germans , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceedingly careful " not to " annoy " American vessels . Committee Decides on Report The Senate Naval Affairs Committee met this afternoon and discussed the Secretary 's testimony , which Senator Walsh , chairman , presented to them in executive session . They voted to authorize Mr. Walsh to prepare a report for public release on the testimony given by Mr. Knox and then went on to discuss how the newspapers were able to print detailed accounts of what happened in the secret session . Referring to reports that Mr. Knox had told the committee an American destroyer had dropped a depth bomb when it seemed to be threatened by a submarine , Mr. Walsh admitted they were " very accurate . " " I do n't know that there is much use issuing our report ' now , " he added . It was indicated that despite his assurances that the United States was not yet trying to " clear the seas of the German menace , " Mr. Knox has not won the wholehearted support of the Naval Af , fairs Committee . Time and again , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the committee members felt they were entitled to have . Neither do they think Mr. Knox was always direct in his replies . For example , one member revealed today that when Mr. Knox said the Navy " would " know what I to do " if the Germans refused passage to American warships convoying American vessels , he declined to answer whether this meant they would " shoot their way through , " That , he said , was a hypothetical question . Similarly , when he said that there was no Anglo-American agreement for action in the Atlantic , he was asked if this meant there was no plan to coordinate the action of the two navies in the I event of war . Mr. Knox was said to have replied that in the event of war the United States vessels would again know what action to take . Doubts Still . Remain . The net result was that despite their discussion with Mr. Knox members of the committee are still in doubt as to the policy of the Navy . They are not sure whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if so , how much . They are not sure whether the base in Iceland means two-thirds delivery to the British , regardless of con ' sequences . This question of when to talk and when to keep quiet is causing comment at the Capitol these days . Senator Lucas , Democrat , of Illinois , complained today that his fel1 low-Senators on the Naval Affairs Committee were talking too much to reporters . Ile said he had declined to comment to reporters on Secretary IKnox ' a testimony because the secrecy pledge had been taken by committee members . ' " Lo and behold , " he exclaimed , " by the time I finished playing golf that evening everything was in the papers . " I want to say that from now on I am going to adopt the policy of the late Senator Couzens of Michigan and refuse to be bound by executive session agreements . " This did not mean that he was going to divulge military or naval secrets in the future , Mr. Lucas Added , but at the same time he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
