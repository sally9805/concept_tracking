txt COURT HALTS CUT IN CITY LIGHT RATE Stays $21,500,000 Annual Reduction in Edison Bills ? Rise on Gas Stands The $21,500,000-a-year cut in Consolidated Edison Company light bills that went into effect on on Jan. 10 was rescinded yesterday by court action , and will end as of tomorrow . The 2,154,000 consumers who benefited by the flat 10 per cent reduction ordered by the Public Service Commission will again pay their former rates as the result of a stay handed down in Albany by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court , Third Department . Exact details of the order will be determined by that court tomorrow , but spokesmen for Edison expected last night that it would require the company to post a bond for the 10 per cent difference between the rates it had , and now has again , and those ordered by the commission . This would guarantee a refund by the company if the commission is eventually upheld in the courts . The court 's decision appeared to leave the company in an even better position than it occupied before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making too much money , for at the same time the commission gave it an increase of $11,440,000 in the rates it charges its gas customers . This increase was not contested by the company and presumably was not involved in the Albany court action . The suit was brought in the Albany court under a long // standing rule that instrumentalities of the state government , such as the Public Service Commission , should be sued in the Albany district , their home grounds . The rate reduction in the lighting costs was the largest ever ordered by the Public Service Commission , and also was one of the first in many years that the company did not grant as the result of prods by the commission , rather than a formal order . However , Milo R. Maltbie , the 77-year-old commission chairman who retired on Jan. 1 , ordered an Edison rate reduction as of Jan. 10 over the company 's objections . When it accepted the gas increase , and contested the light cut , he issued a blistering statement attacking the company for its tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would use every means at its command to combat the decrease . In the normal course of events , this means a protracted legal battle . Some utility rate cases , notably one involving telephone rates , have been known to drag for as long as ten years . Statement by Company An announcement of the Albany court action came in a press release from the Consolidated Edison Company , which said : " Ralph H. Tapscott , chairman of the board of Consolidated Edison , announced this afternoon that the company had been informed that the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court for the Third Department , sitting in Albany , has granted Consolidated Edison 's application for a stay of the recent electric rate order of the Public Service Commission . " This rate order reduced electric rates in the territories served by Consolidated Edison and became effective Jan. 10 . ' The granting of a stay by the court , ' Mr. Tapscott emphasized , means that the company will get relief from the drastic reduction of its electric rates ordered by the Public Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Referring to the temporary ' electric rate order , he added : " This order placed the company in a peculiar and untenable nosition ; where it was practically impossible to get new partners into the bust ... , cress with equity capital . These new partners and this new equity capital are required if the company is to continue to meet the needs of the City of New York for adequate electric service . " Wage Settlement Factor Soon after the Public Service Commission ordered a cut in the . Consolidated Edison Company 's electric rates , the company was threatened with a strike that caused city authorities to prepare for a grave emergency . The labor dispute , involving . 27,000 , workers in the utility 's electricity , gas and steam companies , was settled , however , almost on the eve of the date set for the walkout . Under an agreement reached on the night of Feb. 27 by negotiators for the company and the Utility Workers of America , CIO , with Federal and municipal officials ' participating in the conferences , . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cost $6,500,000 . The . agreement was ratified by the union membership before the strike deadline of 12:10 A. M. on March 2 . The new contract between the company and the union will rim for two years from last March 1 , . with a provision for reopening wage negotiations next March . It gives the employes , among other benefits , an increase across the board of 7 cents an hour , and a. five-cent increase in the maximum salary ranges of 17,000 workers .
