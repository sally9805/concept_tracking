These are TIME 'S standards of editing ; they , along with the methods described above , tell something of an experiment that began 25 years ago . <P> They do not tell whether the experiment is working . That has to be answered with yes and no and maybe . <P> TIME is a success by the standard of the market place , and , in the fiercely competitive U.S. information market , that is not a negligible achievement . Judged professionally , by prevailing journalistic standards , it is generally conceded to do a competent , and occasionally better than competent , job . <P> But that is n't how TIME asked to be judged . It said that the public was badly informed , and that TIME could correct that defect . In a way , the public is better informed than it was 25 years ago , and TIME has had a hand in that improvement . But in a deeper sense , the public is not better informed than a generation ago . The techniques of communication are progressing at a rate slower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to know . <P> The other day , David Lilienthal , chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission , declared that the press , along with radio and the schools , must educate the public to its responsibilities in the atomic age . That is an inescapable challenge . Can the press , the schools , the radio , rise to it ? Probably not . Journalism , as an art of communication , is still in its Bronze Age . Its practitioners , including TIME 'S editors , do n't know enough , and have only rudimentary techniques for communicating what they do know . <P> That is the yes and the no of TIME 'S success . This is the maybe : Along with the information it does or does not communicate , <P> every publication " says " something about the world . The Manchester Guardian has a personality , a tone , that says : " People are decent ; if they would only realize that and trust each other , we should get along better . " The accents of the New York Daily News say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gyp you . " The Times says : " It 's all very difficult , but with close attention to the homework , we may figure it out . " Does TIME say : " It 's a dreadful and wonderful world ; some of it makes sense , some nonsense ; to tell which is which is what a man has a mind for " ? <P> If it does , it communicates something , at least , felt by the editors of TIME .
