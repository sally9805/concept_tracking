Twice a month , the tribes living in the foothills of the Amne Machin range of western China sing an ode to the mighty peaks above . They sing that Amne Machin is a sacred mountain , holding untold stores of gold . Travelers who tamper with its treasures or its mysteries ( says the ode ) will provoke divine wrath expressing itself in hailstorms and other calamities . <P> Undeterred , Chicago 's Milton Reynolds , manufacturer of ballpoint pens ( " . . . writes high in the stratosphere . . . " ) , together with the Boston Museum of Science , arranged an expedition that would explore the hitherto entirely unexplored Amne Machin range . Reynolds was out to discover the world 's highest mountain ( which some believe may be located in the Amne Machin ) , expressed the hope that a grateful China would name it after him . <P> " Well , I 'll Curl Up ! " Reynolds loves adventure and publicity . In Shanghai , he created riots by giving away Reynolds pens . The expedition 's plane developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materialized , made flying impossible . Said Reynolds : " This may be called the lousiest , most disorganized expedition in history , but it will still be said : ' They made it . ' " <P> Soon after that the whole expedition was called off amid fumes of ill will . One day , the Reynolds plane took off , supposedly to go to the U.S. via Tokyo . When it returned to Shanghai after 14 hours , Bradford Washburn , director of the Boston Museum of Science , exclaimed : " Well , I 'll curl up and die ! He must have flown over the Amne Machin range ! " <P> One day last week , Adventurer Reynolds flew into Tokyo , claiming to have barely escaped from the incensed Chinese authorities . He said he had thwarted his pursuers by hurling several cartons of the versatile Reynolds pens at them . <P> " He Can Lie on His Back . " In the midst of the affair , a Peiping newspaper , Hsin Min Pao , drew a moral : <P> " There are differences between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chinese poets are inspired by mountains to write poems . . . . Mountains in China also serve as inspiration for suggestive landscape paintings . The artist does not necessarily have to visit the mountain . He can lie on his back and dream . . . . Now we have Mr. Reynolds , holding an atomic pen in his hand . . . . He knows the value of using mountains to publicize his name and his pen , while the Chinese know only about burying themselves after death in mountains which are famous . " <P> Catching his breath in Tokyo , Reynolds said : " Now we are back in God 's country-at least Americans run it . " Americans still do not run the Amne Machin , which will continue to listen to its ode twice a month .
