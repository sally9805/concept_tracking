St. Mark 's Roman Catholic Church at Burlington , Vt. , a gleaming structure of glass blocks and red brick produced by local architects who were chosen because they had never designed a Catholic church before , is strictly 20th Century . But it has one primitive feature that has rarely been seen in Christian churches since the 9th Century . Its altar is set in the center of the church ( see cut ) , so that the face and hands of the priest offering Mass are visible to his congregation from three sides . The altar of the new cathedral to be built in Britain 's bombed-out Coventry after the war ( TIME , Feb. 21 ) will be similarly centered.
