That Uncertain Feeling ( United Artists ) . For most cinemakers , jokes about psychoanalysts and their patients are as dated as sugar daddies . For cigar-faced Director Ernst Lubitsch , they can form the nucleus of a whole amusing movie about well-cushioned life with the upper crust . He proves it by sending Merle Oberon , a healthy Park Avenue socialite , to consult a Dr. Vengard ( Alan Mowbray ) at the beginning of the picture . When she tells him there is nothing wrong with her , he says : " I 'm sure you will feel differently when you leave this office . " She does . Her happy marriage to a solidly normal insurance salesman ( Melvyn Douglas ) is disrupted by another of the doctor 's patients ( Burgess Meredith ) , a zany pianist badly in need of a few treatments . <P> How Director Lubitsch manages to keep some fun in such an antique problem is still his own secret . There is his flawless sense of timing accentuated by his tricks with the Mickey Mouse technique of scoring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is his Svengalish knack of urging the utmost from his actors . For the first time in his movie career , Burgess Meredith is sufficiently subdued to be a funny comedian . For an advanced course in the sort of fluff &; nonsense which has been the Lubitsch trademark , That Uncertain Feeling is a prerequisite . <P> That Hamilton Woman ( United Artists ) . One of the spiciest scandals in British history occurred during the Napoleonic Wars : the romance of the great one-eyed , one-armed sea dog , Horatio , Lord Nelson ( Laurence Olivier ) , and the frivolous Emma , Lady Hamilton ( Vivien Leigh ) , wife of Britain 's Minister to the Court of Naples . Ostensibly , this British-bred , Hollywood-made film tries to tell it in epic tones . Actually , with the subtlety of a sock on the jaw , it is more concerned with informing U. S. cinemaudiences of the parallel between Britain 's struggle against Napoleonic tyranny and her current tangle with Hitler . <P> Grappling with history , this Alexander Korda production of an R. C. Sherriff-Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Possibly because the narrative is a series of flashback recollections of Lady Hamilton , reclining in prison during her alcoholic dotage , its ponderous plodding can be attributed to the senility of the narrator . All Lady Hamilton offers in her two-hour tale is an extravagant picture of court finery , a romantic rehash of the exploits of the British fleet under Nelson , a fuzzy sketch of Nelson himself , a dazzling portrait of her own staggering beauty . There is no more feeling of life than in a billboard ad . <P> For anyone who left Gone With the Wind believing that Vivien Leigh was an accomplished actress , That Hamilton Woman will come as a nasty shock . While undemonstrative Husband Olivier mumbles his lines in his gullet or grimaces slightly to keep pace with his blind eye and scarred forehead . Miss Leigh changes the key completely by winking , pouting and fanning the air like a signalman . Her dramatic progress has left her only a gender 's distance from Mickey Rooney . The picture provides the sort of lethargic Mother Goose history which does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
