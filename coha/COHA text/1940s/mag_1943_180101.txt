It all started last summer when Conductor Eugene Goossens of the Cincinnati Symphony gazed into the blue vacation waters off the Maine coast . What could he do in the war effort ? What music would forward the spirit of the times ? At length Conductor Goossens wrote to 26 modern composers asking for instrumental flourishes of the sort known as fanfares . Nineteen responded . Six Goossens fanfares are now being played by the NBC Orchestra in six weekly broadcasts of Music at War. * They are Morton Gould 's Fanfare for Freedom ; Henry Cowell 's Fanfare for the Forces of Our Latin-American Allies ; Paul Creston 's Fanfare for Paratroopers ; Felix Borowski 's Fanfare for American Soldiers ; Leo Sowerby 's Fanfare for Airmen ; Goossens ' Fanfare for the Merchant Marine . <P> Sennets and Tuckets . Technically , a fanfare is a brief passage ( from two to 25 seconds ) for brasses , employed as an attention-getter for what follows . The Goossens fanfares , however , are more elaborate compositions , some scored for full orchestra , running as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their titles-Cowell 's , for example , uses a Mexican air . Fanfare , a French word of possible Moorish derivation , is allied to the Elizabethan stage directions sennet ( also senet , sennate , cynet , signet , signate ) and tucket , both indicating musical flourishes . There are no musical samples extant of sennets and tuckets . Sennet may have derived from " seven , " perhaps meant a seven-note trumpet call . Tucket most probably stems from the Italian toccata ( meaning a touch ) , and in all likelihood originally signified a drum sound . <P> Great composers have not neglected the fanfare . Johann Sebastian Bach wrote one for four trumpets in the Christmas Cantata . Beethoven followed the traditional military style of trumpets in unison in Fidelia . Other flourishes are found in Handel , Schumann , Mendelssohn . <P> * NBC 's New York studio , July 8-Aug. 12 , 1:30-12 p.m.
