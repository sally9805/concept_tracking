YOU KNOW HOW IT IS A Story SA UL LEVITT W LL , it felt good around the shoul- ders , it felt free , that was it . You could n't ever fed like this in the uniform . The little old man who had fitted him and tailored the suit now looked him over anxiously and with pride as if the man and the suit were one unit and he had fashioned it . " The main thing is how it feels , " said the little old tailor . " It feels fine , " he said , " that 's all I can say . " The salesman and the tailor wished him luck . And they looked at him anxiously , like a new ship going down the ways . He went out into the sun . There was n't a thing he felt like doing but just looking . New York was his town and let somebody else say it was just a place to visit . This was to his taste , like some people liking olives . The suit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a gray with stripes and a maroon tic . He felt absolutely free and that was the way he was supposed to feel , he guessed . Just gliding along and deciding which street to walk on , which restaurant to eat in . He had promised to look into the office when he got the suit . Talk things over , make talk about this and that . Maybe to figure out if he was going back to the job . He went up there . They said they were glad to see him . They sounded as if they were . They tapped him and they said he was bigger around the shoulders . " How do you feel ? " said Mr. Walker , the head of the drafting department . " I feel fine , " he said sincerely . Everybody asked that , but that was the thing to ask and what he said was the thing to answer . It was 58th Street west . He could see the Hudson from the window and farther north was the George Washington Bridge . High up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cool wind on the hottest day . And the Hudson was always there every time you looked up from the drawing board . He looked around to see Mr. Walker standing there and still wanting to know something . " Well , " said Mr. Walker , " what do you think , Joe ? Any time you say the word . " They had a new lamp over his old drafting board and maybe his eyes would n't get so tired on dark winter days but otherwise it was the same layout . Not bad . He looked around the big room with the drawing boards , each board with the white light shining down  --  looking it all over like somebody who is going to buy something and wants to be sure of what he 's getting for his precious money . Lord , oh Lord , how independent he felt . Free . Rolling his shoulders inside the suit . But he knew just what to say . " I 'd like a week or so just to ? " " Of course , Joe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At a time like this ? We know haw it is . " Mr. Walker took him into the little office and took out a bottle . " The best , Joe , " said Mr. Walker , raising his glass . " Right , " he said , drinking it down . Then he was downstairs again and on the street . He could n't have felt better if he 'd tried . He called up Amy whom he 'd promised to call this afternoon . In the conversation now it was like the two occasions they 'd been together since he 'd got home . He just listened to her mostly . In everything she said she was only saying the same thing : that she was happy he was back . For a moment he could marvel , listening to her , listening to this feeling that had lived and watered itself alone for three years . " . . . and I know you 're busy , " she said . He smiled through the phone knowing that he was n't busy exactly . " Pretty busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could just trot them out and they said things even if you did n't exactly mean them . . . . In a week , you know how it is , yes , we know how it is . I know you 're busy . . . " Pretty busy , " he said again , smiling to himself . " Could n't we meet tomorrow for lunch ? " " Of course , Joe . " " I 'll be there at twelve-thirty , " he said , hanging up and then going out into this sunny day and smiling broadly because everything was so easy . Like pressing buttons . He felt as if he was gliding along effortlessly and he pressed a button and went this way and pressed another and went the other way . The crowds swept by him , with the nervous energy of people with places to go to , things to do . But look at the old lady run for the bus trying to beat the red light changing to green . A heart attack , sure . And missing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fifth Avenue . And the colors everywhere , the colors of the girls ' dresses shopping for bargains on Fifth Avenue . Was there anything like this in the world ? He just walked . Two o'clock . What was wrong with a ball game ? " Yankee Stadium , " he said to the cabby . It was like a picture postcard , the stadium was . The diamond and the green grass and the bleacher walls hung with advertising color . And above the bleacher walls was the elevated track and the Jerome Avenue train like a toy trainon a toy track . It was all like a toy from the grandstand if you looked at it in a certain way . And he was looking at it in that certain way . It was Boston vs . New York but it could have been Chicago vs . St. Louis . It was down below him on the grass like a toy game and it did n't seem to matter who won so long as it was played well . At five o'clock he walked across the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got the train for home . His mother kissed him and told him how good he looked in the new suit . He said , " It feels fine . " He kissed her on the cheek . Supper was cooking and the aroma was good . It was an old aroma , a remembered aroma that he had thought about in all kinds of places in Europe . He sat down in the living room and felt relaxed . He was n't thinking , was n't grasping anything solidly but just letting things float along . It was true he had n't thought of Aunt Helen and Chicago since he 'd been home but he should have thought of her . There had been a wire waiting for him when he 'd arrived home ten days ago inviting him out to Chicago and then for a trip to Wisconsin with Uncle Ed for a week of fishing and canoeing " on a beautiful lake . " Of course he 'd wired back immediately saying that he 'd do it as soon as possible and then he 'd forgotten all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out there right away , that it was the one thing he wanted , and that he could do it easily enough . You could do almost anything you wanted now just by the way you said it . It was almost magic the way you could do these things that he 'd never been able to do before the war . " Mom , " he said , " suppose I were to surprise Aunt Helen , I mean not wiring her or anything but just going out there . I might even do it tonight , come to think of it . " Of course he had every intention of doing it tonight but there was no reason not to let her down gently . He was n't going to hurt her if he could help it . " Tonight ! " said his mother . " But Joe ! You 've only been home a week . " He sat very still and did n't answer . He knew that if he sat still long enough and did n't answer she would figure something out . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was complicated because he was a veteran of the war . He could almost see her working through all the points of the pattern and getting to the end : he was to be Jet alone and to do what he wanted . She just looked at him anxiously and then kissed him and said , " Give my love to Helen and Uncle Ed , " and he was out of the house and walking along and feeling free . It was so easy . ' - rkHE girl behind the cage window said I there was n't anything in the way of a Pullman berth . He just said , " God , if I were still in uniform I suppose it 'd be easy , " and started to walk away . " Oh , " she said , " I did n't notice the discharge . Where were you ? " " Europe . The Ee Tee Oh . " " My husband 's still over . Do you think he 'll be coining home soon ? " " Sure , " he said comfortingly . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You 're lucky . I 've got you an upper for the train tonight . Now do n't you he getting drunk and missing that train just because you 're feeling good . " He laughed and promised he 'd make it and then went out for a couple of drinks before traintime . He listened to the talk all around him in the bar . He could hear a man saying something about a contract to a woman and bringing his hand down with a genteel bang on the bar and the woman nodding as if it was all clear . It looked like an act . It was just a guy in a bar acting for a girl and doing it through this talk of a contract , that was all . That was the way he saw it as he got aboard the night train for Chicago . When he awoke it was Ohio outside . Though he had felt very relaxed he had n't fallen asleep at once . Because he knew the Hudson was flowing there on the left , the big river of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palisades cliffs of the Jersey shore where they used to make their summer evening fires . Tonight he was a free man in clean pajamas lying between white sheets on a train that was going through the night into tomorrow morning . And he could feel the big river of his childhoodlying like a strong arm along his head as he fell asleep . And now it was Ohio outside . And he dressed and he could fed the flush that still came with morning in the United States , which was the flush of knowing that you are alive and that during this day your life is not to be involved . As he shaved among other men shaving and making talk while they shaved , he was still in this flush of being alive . He put on the gray jacket and had breakfast in the diner among people smiling while they toyed with grapefruit and pondered ham and eggs or two boiled eggs . Two women with small children sat at a table nearby , and the children were being cajoled and told stories in order that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if life really could be that careful . He smoked watching Ohio outside the window , Ohio with the gently rolling luxurious land spreading away somewhat like the fields of France about sixty miles south of Paris . He rolled his shoulders inside the suit which was a size forty , a measureless and infinite size forty . Wonderful , wonderful all right . Watkins used to have a way of talking about Ohio . He had worked in Cleveland , commuting every day on the bus . He was always just making that bus after all kinds of adventures involving his kid , the alarm clock , and his wife 's cooking . And it was always this way with Watkins in the Army : he was always making his jokes about that bus , commuting daily , all the way to Omaha Beach , all the way to an exact point in France ten yards in from the waterline . Ohio , Ohio which had raised Watkins and given him his humor , his wife , his bus , and his draft number . Ohio changing to Indiana through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half . It was cool in Chicago , cool and with a clear light everywhere . He drank in a bar off the station , just two drinks , that was all . And then he walked all the way to Michigan Boulevard and across the Boulevard onto the green parkway that touches Lake Michigan . There was something bold and free about this layout along the lake , open to the lake , with the light blinking off a thousand windows . He awoke into the dusk that was advancing on him from the lake , his heart pounding with something that he could n't remember . He was awake on a park bench with his eyes looking right into the dusk coming down on him across a blueness of water turning gray , not knowing where he was or why or how he had got here . He lit a cigarette and it came back to him as he smoked  --  Chicago . Why was he here ? A soldier and a girl came along the walk past him . They walked slowly advancing to the immemorial rite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he felt calm again . He felt fine but he was wondering just what he was doing here in Chicago . He got a cab to the station and walked around the waiting room , trying to figure out what to do now . He picked up a timetable and its schedule was for trains moving westward . His finger stopped at Sioux City . He had been there three years ago in training . The more he thought of Sioux City the more it seemed like the place he ought to see . In that town it used to be that you could go into bars that stayed open late and end up with girls whose names did n't mean anything the next morning . He thought that if he went there now he would find one of those girls but this time he would know her name . Besides , it had been pleasant in Sioux City because people did n't look at the violent loneliness of soldiers through eyes that seemed to peer from behind barricades . And a melody came into his head , the melody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . He was humming " I 'm Dreaming of a White Christmas " when the ticket agent asked , " Where to ? " " Sioux City , " he said . A sooN as the train made that beginning lurch forward he felt much better . As soon as the train was away from the lights of Chicago and there was the dark . ness of countryside outside the window he felt much better . And suddenly he remembered why it was that he had decided to go to Chicago and how he had explained it to his mother . But Aunt Helen had been around a long time , she 'd be around a long time more and he 'd certainly be seeing her one of these days . Sioux City as he saw it the next morning was all there and not something he 'd made up . He had a drink at the Hotel West bar but he did n't recognize anybody here . He kept humming the White Christmas song automatically and without thinking about it . He used to stay at the Mayfair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base . Today he registered there and said he would stay two days and would they put a radio in . He put out a clean shirt , a white one , with which he was going to wear a blue knitted tie . He kept remembering the faces of girls whose names he never knew the next morning . After a shower he felt fresh and happy and wonderfully detached . He discovered that he was very hungry , hungrier than he had been in a long time . He ordered ham and eggs , coffee and pie . But he was still hungry after that and he thought the man might think him nuts if he ordered another meal on top of that . There was another place he used to eat in and he went around the corner and ordered steak and french fries . That did it . He recognized the counterman , a young fellow who had kept telling the soldiers about his hernia whenever he could , in those days when it seemed important if a young guy stood behind a counter instead of behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here before ? " asked the counterman . " I 've never been to Sioux City before in my life , " he said . He walked out and down to the station . Maybe he would have met one of those girls and found out her name this time . He just felt he was gliding effortlessly past people like in a rowboat whose oars are still . You just half-close your eyes and pretty soon everything is moving by you . The boat seems to be gliding and the shores glide by the boat " Denver , please , " he said to the ticket agent . T NIGHT when the moon is up the moun- tains of the Far West show from a train like a high-running sea . The train moving through the rock puts the land into motion making it into a black sea with a long swell . OUR FAILURE IN GERMANY WILLIAM HARLAN HALE F : R since the end of summer , the generals at American Military Gov-ernment headquarters in Berlin have been talking about shutting up shop and coming home . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making Germany behave . It 's because they feel they have about completed it . The confidence which headquarters in Berlin feels in its record and in the consequent good behavior of Germans was expressed in its announcement on October 8 that " the removal of Nazis and those associated with the Nazi ideology and form of government has been accomplished to the extent that additional responsibilities may now be placed in German administrative machinery . " As of mid-November , therefore , control of city and county administration in the American zone of occupation has been handed back to Germans , thus releasing our local and district Military Government specialists from further duty . This step is only one in the accelerating process of MG 's self-liquidation . In early September  --  to take an example  --  the Deputy Military Governor , Lieutenant General Lucius D. Clay , told my chief , Brigadier General Robert A. McClure , who is charged with the control of press , radio , and publications in the American zone , that he wished him to " get out of operations " quickly and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Germans , turning all such activities over to the Germans themselves . This indicated that General Clay felt , as early as four months after Germany 's surrender , chat the work of cleaning up the house and the mind of Germany had already been pushed along so far as to make further close supervision of the German printed word unnecessary . And today it is the intention of the MG chiefs to get out of business entirely before the middle of the coming year , at which time only a small central staff of American civilians is to be left behind to supervise the German official hierarchy by a kind of remote control , with occupation units of reduced strength serving as their policemen . So passes the first and determining phase of American occupation . It was just eight years after Germany laid down arms in 1918 that the Allied occupying powers declared themselves satisfied with German disarmament and withdrew their Commissions of Control . This time , in spite of the far wider-reaching goals we have set ourselves in Germany , our rate of withdrawal and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No need to worry any more about Germany ; what remains now is to work things out with our Allies , " was , in effect , the policy thought passed down the line inside MG from General Clay 's office last August . There was bright relief in this Mr. Hale recently returned from Germany , where he served as Policy Adviser to the Information Control Division of our occupation forces . for the war-weary . But as they pile aboard the homeward-bound planes at Tempelhof or Frankfurt , our officials may remember how the Washington policy-makers enjoined them on going into Germany not to relax their controls over German life until the main American objectives toward Germany had either been attained or were within safe prospect of it . To what extent have they been attained ? MHE objectives themselves are pretty I clear . They were set forth in April in a directive to General Eisenhower drafted by representatives of the State , Treasury , War , and Navy Departments and issued by the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the OK of the White House . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but every ranking MG official carried his copy of it into Germany , knowing it by its famed serial number , JCS 1067/6 , and often referring to it as " The Bible . " The paper was presented to the Potsdam Conference as embodying the American position and , with certain omissions and minor modifications , its substance was written into the Potsdam Agreement . To recapitulate its substance : The directive states that our prime objective is to prevent Germany from ever again becoming a threat to the peace of the world , and that in order to achieve this General Eisenhower is to disarm the country , to remove its war industries to Allied nations or else destroy or demilitarize them . to keep German heavy industrial production down to a minimum , to break up Germany 's cartels , and to root out of German life all surviving Nazi and militarist influences , permitting no compromises to be made in the interests of expediency or convenience . Specifically , the directive tells General Eisenhower that except insofar as may be necessary for meeting Allied reparations or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps ( a ) looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany , or ( b ) designed to maintain the German economy . " It tells him to take no action that might give the Germans basic living standards higher than those existing in any neighboring country which they had overrun . Finally it tells him to permit free trade unions and otherwise to prepare for the reconstruction of democratic life in Germany . These were the orders  --  later to be reinforced by the Potsdam Agreement  --  with which we went into Germany . II D ulaNc the final weeks of the campaign I traveled by jeep in the wake of the Seventh Army 's ptish from the Rhine through Wiirttemberg and into southern Bavaria . What amazed me almost more than anything else about this lightning drive was the speed with which our men were already putting trunk lines of the heavily bombed and battered German railway network back into working shape . Alongside the armed motor convoys streaking eastward from the Rhine bridgeheads I could see long freight trains , whose German box-cars had already been relabeled U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Neckar valley . In order to get jobs like this done , it had been necessary for our transport officers to seek out German railway officials and get vital operating data from them . Most of the officials obliged . The most obliging of all was a high-ranking Nazi  --  Dr. Julius Dorpmueller , director general of the German State Railway , and Hitler 's Minister of Transport besides . It was Dorpmueller who had planned the rail-borne part of Hitler 's surprise attacks against his neigh-hors in the East and West , and who had then looted the rail systems of the occupied countries . For this -- and for having planned the rail movements of German divisions in the West last December in such a way as to catch American commanders off base in the Battle of the Bulge  --  Dorpmueller had received high decorations from Hitler . Yet he proved so helpful to our transport chiefs at SHAEF that they invited him in to act as an adviser on German rail reconstruction . A month after the war was over , I found him still buzzing around them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the headquarters of our Transport Division in Frankfurt , I found the railway officers
