For one day last week , India was practically without news . More than 100 of India 's newspapers suspended publication in a one-day hartal ( Indian sitdown strike ) . Only nine major papers appeared . <P> India 's press is a hodgepodge . There are the British-owned English-language papers : the Calcutta Statesman , the Bombay Times of India , etc . There are few Moslem papers ( some English-language , some native ) , like the newly started Delhi Dawn of Obstructionist Mohamed Ali Jinnah . And there are the liberal , Hindu-owned English-language and Hindu-language papers , like the Calcutta Amrita Bazar Patrika and the Bombay Chronicle , that support Mohandas Gandhi . These latter , in the majority , are always whole-hog for Indian independence . <P> Before the war all Indian papers were fairly free ; there were restrictions , but the British seldom applied them . When war came , Indian editors and British leaders agreed : 1 ) the press would not hamper Britain 's war effort ; 2 ) the Government would permit the papers to go on demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government retained the right to close any obstreperous publication after giving the offending editor full warning , a second chance . Things worked well until last August , when the suppression of Gandhi 's civil-disobedience campaign culminated in disorders . <P> Heavy Hand . India 's press at once felt Britain 's heavy hand . Papers in Delhi were ordered to limit political trouble stories to three columns , use headlines not higher than a fifth of an inch over them . Elsewhere in India news offices were searched , some papers suppressed , some editors arrested . <P> India 's editors stood it as long as they could , in late December decided to stage last week 's hartal . They also decided to refuse to print , thenceforth , any unnewsworthy British handouts or the speeches of any British statesmen . On New Year 's Day they failed to publish such routine news as Britain 's annual " honors list .

By watching the British press , Indians long ago learned that an unfettered press is a steppingstone to freedom . Because they had good British newsmen as models ( Rudyard Kipling joined the Lahore Civil and Military Gazette in 1882 ) , Indians grew up to be Grade A journalists , dialectically skillful , intensely nationalistic . <P> The British , faced with a rebellious Indian press , this week had only to look to the past to see who was to blame . From Britain herself , Indian editors had learned to value press freedom and to fight for it .
