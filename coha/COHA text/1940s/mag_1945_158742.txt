The Administration , backed by the Army &; Navy , last week put before the U.S. public its conviction that all sound and able-bodied U.S. young men , in peace as well as in war , must be trained to bear arms . <P> In a highceilinged , austerely white caucus room the House Select Committee on Postwar Military Policy began hearings which might well upset the U.S. tradition against peacetime conscription . <P> Expecting a crowd , tall , white-haired Committee Chairman Clifton Alexander Woodrum , a shrewd Virginia Democrat who has wangled many a military appropriation through the House , installed a public address system in the spacious chamber , had a small regiment of usherettes on duty . <P> The crowd did not come . At the first session , the room was less than one-fourth filled ; at another session only four of the committee 's 23 members were present . Was this a true test of the public 's attitude ? Did indifference mean that the U.S. public , except for vocal minorities , was completely sold on the idea ? Opinion polls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still on-favor compulsory peacetime training . <P> Things as They Are . Under Secretary of State Joseph C. Grew keynoted the supporting arguments . Said he : " . . . In the world of things as they are , our international policy , to be effective , must have strength behind it . " He added that the U.S. must be prepared to provide its complement of troops to a United Nations peace-policing pool . <P> From the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars came unstinted support . From the National Guard Association 's pugnacious president Major General Ellard A. Walsh , came a headline-raising question : " If Russia finds it imperative to train boys of 15 and 16 , then how can the people of this nation ignore the issue ? " <P> Things as They Might Be . The opposition came from those who have always stood against peacetime training : the clergy , educators , labor unions . Their arguments were traditional : that 1 ) instead of building new military strength , the U.S. should concentrate on limitation and reduction of arms at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith " ; 2 ) a large standing army with an active bureaucracy and a permanent conscription system must ultimately undermine democracy . To these they added another , more contemporary plea : that those now in the Army &; Navy be given an opportunity to express their views . <P> This week the Army &; Navy prepared to move up their heavy artillery . Scheduled to testify were War Secretary Stimson , Navy Secretary Forrestal , Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King , and probably many of the generals recently returned from Europe . To spearhead its argument , the Administration will depend on General of the Army George Catlett Marshall , the man who , although hating war , raised and trained the army which is helping to win World War II . General Marshall 's often-expressed views on peacetime conscription are adamant : he is for it with no reservations . <P> Last week General Marshall was photographed at the circus with his three-year-old step-grandson , Jimmy Winn ( see cut ) . Citizen-Soldier George Marshall believes that Jimmy will have to know how to do a soldier 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
