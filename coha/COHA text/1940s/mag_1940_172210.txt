At New York 's Jamaica race track one day last week State Senator John J. Dunnigan swaggered up to a freshly painted pari-mutuel window , loudly &; proudly proclaimed : " Much time has passed since I began my fight for pari-mutuel betting at New York tracks , so I am purchasing the first $2 ticket on Time Passes , " + <P> At the end of the day , the 25,000 spectators , who jampacked Jamaica 's old stands , had poured $821,946 into the machines . It was the largest crowd Jamaica had ever seen and it was a larger handle than even Senator Dunnigan had hoped for . Thus , with a bang , pari-mutuel betting invaded New York race tracks , for years the last stronghold of the bookmaker . Jubilant over an $800,000 handle on a raw-cold Monday , New York Statesmen had visions of a $100,000,000 turnover before the racing season ends , Nov. 2 . Envious of the State 's share of the gravy ( 5% of the turnover ) , New York City officials promptly announced that its 2% sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races at Jamaica and Aqueduct , both within the city . <P> +Thus flagrantly violating pari-mutuel etiquette , which in the interest of speed and accuracy at the tellers ' windows demands that betters call their bets by the horse 's number , not name . Nevertheless , he got $13.50 for his $2.
