( See Cover ) <P> One afternoon early last October a happy , jaunty Irishman , whose bantam-sized body houses an almost inhuman store of nervous energy , strolled into his four-room apartment in Washington 's elegant Shoreham Hotel . With sly casualness , fully aware of the dramatics of the occasion , he said to his wife : " Well , Maude , I 've just given up my job . " The job was that of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court-which had seemed , 16 months before , like the pinnacle of achievement to a man born on the wrong end of famed , aristocratic King Street in Charleston , South Carolina . <P> When Franklin Roosevelt appointed <P> James Francis Byrnes to the Supreme Court in June 1941 he remarked that he wished he were Solomon : he would like to cut Jimmy Byrnes in two , put half of him on the Court , leave half in the Senate , where Jimmy had been a super-politician , a knowing , super-successful leader . Now Franklin Roosevelt had called Jimmy off the bench and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economic Stabilization with such broad authority that only Franklin Roosevelt remained more powerful . Perhaps Franklin Roosevelt now wished he were a super-Solomon and could divide Jimmy into three . <P> In the Left Wing . In the three months that Jimmy Byrnes has functioned as the U.S. economic czar of World War II , the U.S. people have heard but little more of him than when he operated within the cloistered walls of the highest court . Every morning , shortly before 9 o'clock , a White House car calls at the Shoreham , takes Jimmy to his high-ceilinged office in the White House east wing ( Jimmy delights in calling it the left wing ) . Jimmy sits at a huge , unlittered desk with one telephone . <P> Jimmy hardly moves from this room all day . Like his boss at the other end of the White House , he has lunch at his desk at 1 o'clock . He talks frequently with the President by telephone , sees him two or three times a week . Most of his day is taken up with conferences with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are telephone conversations with Senators and Representatives , reading of reports and memorandums , plotting of strategy with his seasoned idea man , Benjamin Victor Cohen . ( Except for idealistic Ben Cohen , Jimmy Byrnes 's staff consists of but three others : Donald Russell , his onetime law partner in Spartanburg , ex-Washington Reporter Samuel Lubell , and corpulent Office Secretary Edward Prichard . ) At 7 o'clock the White House car takes Jimmy Byrnes home for dinner ; usually he takes a brown Manila paper envelope full of reports with him . Almost his only relaxation is walking his wire-haired fox terrier , Whiskers , along Washington 's tree-lined streets at night . <P> Order 9250 . In its simplest terms , Jimmy Byrnes 's job is to rivet a lid on civilian economy that will prevent an uncontrolled inflation from breaking out . In the words of Executive Order 9250 , he is directed to " formulate and develop a comprehensive national economic policy relating to the control of civilian purchasing power , prices , rents , wages , salaries , profits , rationing , subsidies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute power to order any Government administrator to carry out the points of that policy .
