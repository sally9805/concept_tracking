As if there were n't enough trouble in the world , there came a report last week of more ahead . Europe 's and Asia 's millions , living at best frugally , in some cases on starvation diets , are facing an even sterner winter than 1946-47 . There is going to be less food to send them in 1947-48 . <P> Any hope of Western Europe feeding herself had vanished . Spring floods and summer drought had reduced Italy 's wheat harvest to a little more than two-thirds of what it was last year . Winter killing had ravaged the grain fields of France , Denmark , Belgium , The Netherlands . Ironically , the only successful crops in Europe were those planted almost wholly behind the Iron Curtain . <P> The worst news of all was that the U.S. , which had had ten years of good crops , and which is the largest single supplier , this year had to record a failure . It had been a bumper year again for wheat , but the corn crop had withered . The total supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14,400,000 tons under 1946 , which was almost exactly the amount the U.S. had exported to needy nations . <P> Despite the partial crop failure , the U.S. had the grain to help feed the world . But the Government did not like to dip down too far into the nation 's food bins . If crops were bad next year , the U.S. might need its surplus for itself . Farmers were storing some 70% of their wheat to 1 ) keep out of higher income-tax brackets this year , and 2 ) get better prices later on . Some farmers were feeding wheat to cattle and hogs . <P> Between now and Christmas the U.S. people would hear a lot about plans to bring the grain out . Any plans would inevitably put new pressures on the U.S. economy .
