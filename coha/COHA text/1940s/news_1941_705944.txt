txt For the first time since the British debacle in Norway , which ended in the overthrow of the Chamberlain Government , there are serious signs of an approaching crisis over the question of whether Britain has been doing everything possible to aid Russia . The Government has been asked for a full statement on the military situation in Russia . Mr. Emanuel Shinwell. front bench Labor M. P. , has set forth a pointed question with a request for an immediate answer . His move is symptomatic of the growing uneasiness among many members of parliament . This does n't mean , however , that there is any visible prospect that Prime Minister Winston Churchill will be overthrown or even seriously challenged . The political position is by no means the same as it was in April , 1940 . Then there was a Churchill ready to take the place of Mr. , Chamberlain . Today on the political horizon there is only a Churchill . Public Aroused But the fact remains that public sentiment , as well as political feelings are running high in Britain today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectives : the Soviet Capital and the Caucasus oil . The press in particular has turned loose a torrent of exhortation urging the government to act and the country to awake . Critical opinions that have been quietly current in certain British circles and among some non-British observers here for some time are now being put into strongly printed words . The leading editorial in the Daily Mail today is typical of this new note of press comment . It sums up fully , yet concisely. the feeling here that more might be done than has ' been done . I quote its conclusion fairly completely because it is a significant example of hard-hitting democratic press criticism during a war time emergency : " It is high time that a more general realization of what we 're up against and the measures needed to face and overcome it is accepted by one and all . Complacency Hit " There is far too much complacency in quarters both high and low , It is unfortunate , to say the least , that we always seem to need bad news as a stimulant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events . " That 's been the story of this war so far . Off to a bad start : always trying desperately to catch up . Until we 've caught up and are abreast of events we can not hope to turn the scales in our favor . " From the beginning we 've allowed ourselves to be lulled by delusions . " Before the war it was said ' there 'll be no war . ' When Hitler invaded Norway it was said that he had made his ' biggest strategical blunder . ' When he invaded France it was said ' Now he 'll meet his doom ' Wheii he invaded ' the Balkans it was said ' the country does n't favor a blitzkrieg ' When he invaded Russia it was said ' Now he 'll meet with the fate of Napo-leon ' " The fact is that we can not rely upon Hitler making mistakes to give us victory . There is only one way we can earn it  --  by ' blood , toil , tears and sweat . ' " That 's the plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be otherwise . But we 've got to face realities , and until we do victory will remain beyond our reach . " Several other papers echo this warning note . The News-Chronicle , for instance , says " In their extreme danger the Russians are asking for our aid . Whatever we can do we should do now . If by any action in the air , on the sea or on land  --  even at great risk  --  we can help relieve the fearful pressure in the East we should take that action . " The Daily Herald links Russia 's ' need for aid with a strongly worded attack on Viscount Halifax whom it accuses of complacency . The paper contends Lord Halifax 's recent utterances lack realism and therefore tend to impede rather than expedite America 's organization of aid to Britain and Russia . Declaring that " the truth is that America 's war effort so far is lagging a long way behind the democracies ' need , " the Herald says Britain 's message to America must be : " Russia is directly threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States are inextricably linked . If Russia should fall , the danger to Britain and America would become incalculably greater . Therefore America must face the facts . Her utmost possible output is needed now to sustain Russia 's magnificent armies and to aid Britain if Russia 's resistance should be so weakened that Hitler is able to throw his full forces into a direct attack on these islands . " View of the Times The Times takes a less drastic view but admits " there is a feeling of anxiety about our own part , a sharp questioning ? whether we are doing all in our power to aid Russia . It is well , too , that the Government should be aware of the feeling throughout the country of the need for the greatest possible boldness within the bounds of reason . " The Times concludes , however , " But it must be evident that we should serve the cause of Russia very little even temporarily and even do it irretrievable damage in the long run if we allowed ourselves to be rushed into impracticable ventures . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and press sentiment in favor of forcing the Government to review its position for the purpose of making sure that nothing is being neglected that could be done to help Russia continue its resistance . But it would be misleading not to point out at the same time that in general there is a feeling that the Government is right in not making any rash move which might leave the British Isles seriously weakened before any Nazi attempt at invasion . Thus while the press reveals growing signs of an embryonic political crisis , it Is still obvious that Mr. Churchill retains vir- , tually the complete confidence of the nation as a whole , and that there is little likelihood that his authority will be seriously challenged by Parliament In the near future . But the demand for a more positive policy has been given a big impetus by the course of war in Russia , and it is not possible to say with certainty how far this wave of searching criticism might go it the ' Soviets should collapse soon under the impact of Hitler 's tremendous " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
