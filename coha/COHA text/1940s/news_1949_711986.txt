txt Even before the first formal request for military assistance , leaders of several Western European countries recommended to Kenneth C. Royall , Secretary of the Army , that the number of American troops on the European continent be increased . The " complete unanimity " on this point it was learned today , was reported by Mr. Royall to the House Appropriations Committee in an executive session on March 7 . A complete transcript of the hearings was released over the week-end . In his testimony , the secretary stated flatly that , even when the Germans were restored to control of their government . " the necessity for occupation troops is still important . " This country , he said , entertained no thought that there " can safely be any reduction of military forces in Germany in the near future . " He asserted there was " an insistent request for additional troops , " without designating specifically from what countries the requests came . Europe Stressing Land Forces Developing this theme , Mr. Royall said that the importance of land forces for Europe was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were devoting " much the greater part of their resources to their ground armies , " with the average about twice as much for the army as it was for the air force and navy combined . " Now if such expenditures had already resulted in strong armies over there up to this time , it would simplify our problem ; but no one who has been there would want to risk our destiny in war on the ability of the nations of Europe or Africa , or any point in Asia , to hold back an invading force without our help on the ground . At least , I do not know anybody who feels that way , " Secretary Royall told the Representatives . " Therefore , with complete unanimity the leaders that I talked with urged the necessity of American forces on the European continent and the necessity of increasing those forces if possible . They are acutely aware of the capability of danger . They realize that they do not have , either individually or collectively , the forces which could prevent armed aggression from the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In reporting these requests to the House committee , Mr. Royall voiced his belief that intelligent analysis revealed that military aid must go hand-in-hand with economic aid . He Urges Clarity of Purpose " Any attempt to disregard the military aspects and depend entirely on economic assistance is totally unrealistic in the face of a police state which recruits its troops ' 13r terror and coercion and controls them by the same means , " he said . " We must maintain a clarity of purpose and a military stature capable of direct and immediate aid should ' a need of the aid arise . A failure to maintain the one may quickly nullify the other . " As this testimony reached the Representatives , several members of the Senate sought confirmation of reports that the United States intended to transfer 150 Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers to Great Britain as part of the program to assist Western Europe to rearm . Senator Styles Bridges , Republican , of New Hampshire , who is the ranking minority member of the Senate Appropriations Committee , revealed that he had asked Senator Millard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Services Committee , to inquire into the matter . Promising to investigate , Senator Tydings disclosed that he had received a like request from Senator William F. Knowland , Republican , of California . In calling for information , Senator Bridges said he probably would not oppose such a transfer f the United States ' military leaders said it was essential to American security , but he added that he did want to know what it would cost . He said he wanted cost translated into " terms of what we have to pay for such bombers  --  not in terms of how they might be charged off as surplus . " He said he understood that each B-29 costs $1,000 , - 000 delivered . There is the belief in some quarters that , if such a transfer to Britain is made , it can be justified on the ground that it will give this country a forward base against any aggressive action in Europe while permitting the British to familiarize themselves with the operation of the B-29 type of plane .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
