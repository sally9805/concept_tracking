THE astonished citizens of the greatest mining camp in the world are watching a leopard change its spots right before their eyes . Anaconda Copper , austere overlord of Butte , has hit the sawdust trail . Soft words and community singing are heard in tired streets which have echoed to decades of epithets and gunfire and yells for martial law . Stilled periodically are the greedy chatter of slot machines and the slap of poker chips ; church bells sound a triumphant welcome to clear-eyed congregations , and at times there 's hardly a hangover on the Hill . Economic maturity and community social consciousness have come to Montana 's beatup metropolis . They arc welcome in always hospitable Butte , but never was a host caught so poorly prepared . The beds are unmade and the dishes unwashed , there are cockroaches in the kitchen and rats in the cellar . If the newcomers ca n't be diverted by a trip out to the night-blooming suburb of Meadervile for drinks and steaks and a turn at the wheel ? and these arrivals can not be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the place .... After determining , of course , if they 're going to stick around long enough to make it worth while . There is every indication that they have come to stay . The Anaconda Copper Mining Company has announced for its " richest hillon earth " one of the most prodigious underground operations ever undertaken , a project whose initial development costs exceed twenty million dollars , which assures ? for the first time ? community continuity through at least two generations , and which promises to terminate the weary old camp 's enervating cycle of boom and bust . And that is not all . " The Company , " damned in Montana throughout a quarter century for moral insensibility and inept public relations , has suddenly gone in for civic benevolence on a scale hitherto undreamed of in that State , and rare anywhere . Its Butte employees are members ? free ? of a brand-new , half-million-dollar club , unsurpassed for luxury in any American industrial center . A community association is the recipient , no strings attached , of a new two-milliondollar hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has the latter 's two-million-dollar guarantee to support a project to erect five hundred homes , some of which are already built and sold . And , finally , the awestruck taxpayers arc being importuned to accept a Company gift of lots for a civic recreation center and please to put the bite on Anaconda for $400,000 in new taxes which will represent nearly half the cost of the completed playground . Meanwhile the Ministerial Association , suddenly become militant , has succeeded in forcing one shutdown of the town 's notorious game rooms , and a " blue ribbon " citizens ' group has pledged a fight to the finish with the tinhorns who have victimized Butte for decades . And in the new Employees ' Club the bosses from the sixth floor of the Hennessy Building , which houses Anaconda 's top brass , form a bowling team called the " Elevator Boys " which rolls in competition with CIO miners on glistening new alleys ? and joins the muckers for beer downstairs after the game . Nothing remotely like this ever happened before . Decades of distrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anaconda is cooking up a plot which will be even more Machiavellian than anything Montana has known in the past ; they are cagily watching for the gimmick . Other and simpler souls just think the Company has gone nuts . Probably both groups are wrong . The Company is investing vast sums in a mining operation of a type never attempted before , one which promises to enhance its competitive position in world metal markets . It needs harmonious employee relations and a stable payroll in a stable community . In the old days more than half of the miners who rustled " for jobs in Butte were single men , reckless and rough and improvident . Today the pattern is reversed : seventy per cent are married ; and though choosy , they 're steady . Butte has never been a family town . It is reasonable to suppose that Anaconda executives on the ground , the men directly charged with the success of the new enterprise , have decided that Butte shall become a family town ? or else . II c . F. KELLEY , chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in September 1947 to address a Butte Chamber of Commerce banquet . Kelley had spoken frequently before this group , invariably offering rhetorical reassurance to the timid business men of the community which has been described as the most vulnerable in America to economic forces beyond its control . He reminded them , as he often had before , that Butte 's fabulous mountain still holds the greatest mineral wealth known to be concentrated in such a small area anywhere on earth , that the wide veins of MAGAZINE ore in which its riches are embedded show no sign of exhaustion though some of them have been followed to a depth of nearly a mile . He reviewed the spectacular production record of the Hill . " Since copper was discovered in a silver mine about seventy years ago , the Butte district ? four square miles ? has yielded thirteen and a quarter billion pounds of it . That is a third of all the copper used in the United States during that time , a sixth of all used in the world . With the copper came three billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half pounds of manganese , six hundred million ounces of silver . Butte Hill , pouring more than two and a half billion dollars into the treasury of A. C. M. , has made it the world 's foremost non-ferrous metal company , operating in fifteen States and several foreign countries . But none of this was news to Butte , and none of it was particularly heartening . It is impossible to determine for more than a few years ahead , Kelley admitted , just what reserves remain in Butte 's wandering highgrade ore bodies , tapped by 7,500 miles of tunnels and drifts and crosscuts . Veins which " apex " on the Hill and may be mined there a few hundred feet below the surface plunge thousands of feet underground down on " the Flat " ; they are faulted and fissured always , and some day inevitably they will be finished . That day is not yet in sight . At this point in previous speeches Kelley had sat down , to receive the customary tribute of applause to the city 's aging ( Anaconda 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This time he kept on talking . " 1 propose now to speak , " he said , " of what will be the greatest period in the history of Butte . " He then made the first public announcement of " an entirely new project through which will be recovered billions of pounds of metals which under existing methods would be lost to a needy world . " rtr s was " the Greater Butte Project . " f he announcement should have elec- ified the Butte Chamber of Commerce , but it is only now , almost a year later , that the local significance of the development is being dimly sensed in the town which John Gunther described in Inside U.S.A. as " almost literally dying on its feet . " Because of the depth of its mines , Butte has been one of the highest-cost districts in the world , subject to calamitous shutdowns when prices softened . By virtue of the new project , which will drastically reduce average costs without curtailing customary operations , production can be maintained in periods of weakened markets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe , All of that spells unprecedented stability for the city of Butte . But invalidism crushes the spirit of men and of towns , and Butte had been long diseased ? to the extent that it seemed almost to have lost the impulse for recovery . It had long since ceased to bother to cover its ugly sores . Between 1930 and 1940 it had lost 3,000 of its 40,000 people . During the war it lost thousands more , and after the war it lost hope . The highest wage scales in history failed to lure men back to the mile-high city of mile-deep mines , the city of grimy store fronts and glittering gambling joints , of political scandals and hoodlum scares . Butte was well on its way to becoming the biggest ghost town in America , and only a few of its people seemed to care . Today 's estimates indicate it has regained 8,000 of its people ? virtually all of its wartime and postwar loss . From a low of about 2,500 , the mine payroll has risen to about 5,500 . The Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in years is confident it will get them . Pay is above wartime levels : the " base rate " is $10.15 a day , and miners underground average about $14 a day on individual " piecework " contracts . Work has begun on " the Greater Butte Project . " Its first and most dramatic phase is the driving of the largest mine shaft ever dug in the Western hemisphere into the heart of Butte Hill ? a hole 36 feet 6 inches long and 9 feet wide and 3,500 feet deep . Butte 's economic experience of half a century has been hand-to-mouth . The new project can change that ; and the Company now acknowledges , perhaps tardily , that an industry which dominates a city and a State can not live by and for itself alone . " We must have and maintain , " said Kelley , in concluding his speech , " a community of which we and our wives and children can be proud , a community that will be attractive to family men and women as a desirable place for the raising of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years Butte will offer to students of social transition a community sample unique in America , in some respects comparable to a bomb-damaged city in Europe which is required to learn new economic functions as it rebuilds . And , as in Europe , it will be the temper of the town rather than the tens of millions to be spent there which will determine the quality of living in the new Butte . III T RE spirit of a community can not be wholly destroyed . That of Butte survived , through depression , war , and depopulation , in the hearts of Tim Sullivan and a few determined men who rallied to his appeal when their town was down and almost out . The new structure will be erected partially upon the foundation they laid . Tim Sullivan is a native of Butte , to which his mother came in an ox-drawn wagon . At fourteen he was a " nipper " ? tool boy ? in the mines ; today he is a prosperous manufacturer of valve assemblies , heaters , boilers , and other metal products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are independent of the A. C. M. In the spring of 1946 , a year and a half before there had been even a whisper about " the Greater Butte Project , " Tim set out to see if anything could be done to shore up the city 's collapsing economy . He remembered a meeting which Catholic Bishop Joseph M. Gilmore had called several years earlier in an attempt to persuade quarrelsome factions to forget their grievances and work together to save Butte . The Reverend Dr. J. J. O'Connor had presided at that meeting . Tim went to Father O'Connor and the two Irishmen talked over the plight of their city , which they love as only Irishmen could have Butte and Boston . ( The two cities , believe it or not , have a lot in common . ) Out of their conversation grew the Butte Development Association , the first cross-section , community-wide organization in the history of the town dedicated solely to civic improvement . The Anaconda was not in on its formation , and though now affiliated through individual memberships , it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can stand on their own feet . The directorate includes representatives of industry , labor , and business ; the first contribution to the treasury was one hundred dollars from the Miners ' Union . Tim brought industrial engineers to Butte to survey opportunities and liabilities . Their initial report , published in full-page advertisements paid for by the Association , sought to avoid outright offense but told the truth . The report deplored public apathy , wrangles between management and labor , lack of aggressiveness in small business , an outmoded political structure . Industry ? which meant chiefly the Company ? was cited for neglect of its community responsibilities , especially failure to help provide adequate recreational facilities . Labor heard about its archaic working rules and its uneconomic six-hour day for building craftsmen . The Association went to work on several projects : recreation center , new hospital . surveys to develop opportunity for new industry and business . Before long its chief energies were devoted to providing livable homes for the new people it hoped to persuade to come to Butte . There were vacancies ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceding fifteen years , so the available residences were not of a type to attract house hunters . T HE first of the Association 's housing projects was well under before the Kelley speech promised new security to Butte . Thirty-one homes of four and five rooms , some with extra stories which would accommodate more bedrooms , were erected on residential lots acquired for a nominal sum from the Company . Well insulated and modern , the houses were priced at $6,950 to $8,000 ? their actual cost , since the Association , which acted as general contractor and broker , took no overall profit . In December 1947 , Butte observed " Housing Day , " when the first completed homes were sold . Anyone employed in Butte could buy , on easy terms . The same day ground was broken for the second project , to have 175 homes . Its forty-acre site is clear of buildings , so this project will benefit by more up-to-date " garden city " planning . Miners and other craftsmen who are capable of building their own homes may do so here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general pattern ; and they may purchase materials at low cost from the Association , which buys in huge quantities . The ground-breaking ceremony on " Housing Day " was attended by thousands . They watched ? some of them rather incredulously ? while Ed McGlone , Anaconda vice president , and Oscar Hills , president of the Miners ' Union , took turns with a spade . As plans developed for still more ambitious projects , the Company came forward with a blank check guarantee of up to two million dollars to assure that the banks would accept the Association 's paper . Up to the present , however , indebtedness has totaled less than $200 , 000 , and this is being repaid rapidly as houses in the first unit are completed and sold . The objective is five hundred new homes , within a year or two . When it has been achieved , Tim and the Association can turn their energies to almost equally pressing tasks . Butte 's business district must be cleaned up and modernized . Its governmental structure is sadly in need of reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medieval dungeon in the cellar . It needs a new library , more attractive schools , and better streets . But probably many functions as yet unforeseen will be entrusted to the Development Association in the future , for it is no longer a desperate gesture but has become an important social implement : the community rebuilding of which its founders dreamed has been made feasible by " The Greater Butte Project . " IV V NING techniques which are to be em- ployed in the new project are not themselves new ; but never before have they been used at such depth as is contemplated in Butte . Nor have they ever been wholly employed , as they will be there , to recover low-grade copper ore from already mined-off areas . The Greater Butte Project " is designed to obtain the remaining mineral values from mines which have been worked for the past sixty years as high-grade operations . It supplements but does not supersede the continuing milling of high-grade ore by conventional methods in other Butte areas , or in the same area but at greater depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the force heretofore employed . As ore was removed by conventional methods from the Hill , the scopes were filled with waste rock . These " gobs " ? as the filled working spaces are designated ? and the low-grade pillars between the mined-out regions contain copper and other minerals , but in smaller quantities than in the major veins . The key to economic recovery of this low-grade ore is in the great tonnage now available and a mining process ( known technically as " block caving " ) . which reduces labor and transportation costs by permitting the handling of larger quantities of rock by fewer men than was possible by the other method . Conventional mining entails the blasting out of a few feet of ore at a time in a drift or stope ; in the new operation , ten blocks of low-grade material , each block 136 Eeet long , 100 feet wide , and hundreds of feet thick , will be " developed " at the same time . C ALCULATIONS by Company engineers and exploration of the project area have disclosed that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth of 3,500 feet . There is more below , but investigation has not proceeded beyond this level . On nine different horizons , more than 22,000 feet of drifts and crosscuts have been opened in the main ore zone ; samples ( 1l2,000 tons of them ) removed from these cuts have definitely fixed the copper content of the whole body to be 1.37 per cent , as against an average 4.5 per cent in Butte 's high-grade operations . The mining process is relatively sitnple . The giant shaft ? so big that special engineering techniques had to be developed for handling twice as much material as is ordinarily removed From a shaft ? will be sunk first to 2,200 feet and later to 3,500 . From the foot of the shaft , a haulage way as big as a railroad tunnel will pierce the rock mass . " Raises " ( shafts ascending at an angle ) will be driven up about 52 feet from this haulage way and will be connected at their upper extremities by a drift ? a smaller , horizontal tunnel ? which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drift , small " finger raises " will be thrust vertically eighteen feet up into the block of ore , undermining it . The block will shatter and slowly cave in , subsiding into the drift , where steel-rail screens known as " grizzlies " will have been set over the mouths of the angled raises . In the drift , miners will break up rock which is too large to go through the screens . The ore will slip down through the raises into waiting mine cars in the haulage way . Gravity does most of the work . Bigger mine cars , bigger locomotives , and bigger " skips " ( buckets which carry ore to the surface ) will help to cut costs . The cars will carry five tons each , in hundred-ton trainloads ; present cars have a capacity of three tons . Skips will rocket to the surface 2,500 feet a minute , carrying twelve tons each and dumping out of the bottom of the bucket ; the present skips carry three to eight tons and have to be up-ended for dumping . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring construction of a special concrete plant . In the shaft will be two skip compartments ( skips are counterbalanced : one rises as the other descends ) and a service cage large enough to handle a mine locomotive . Later this service compartment will be converted into two additional skipways , after a second shaft for service only has been put down . T IIE production schedule of the new project calls for an output of 5,000 tons of ore per day by the end of the third year , 10,000 tons daily in the fourth year , and at ! east 15,000 after the second shaft is in operation . Recovery of the ore known to be available above 3,500 feet will take at least thirty-five years . After that the same methods can be applied to deeper levels in this area , or to the many other sections in the Butte district whose low-grade ore reserves have not yet been fully investigated . To solidify the blocks and to extinguish fires which are present in the heretofore abandoned areas , nine million tons of tailings will be brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old mine workings . This requires construction of new rail and loading facilities at Anaconda , twenty-five miles from Butte . These tailings , waste from the copper concentrating operation , were originally muck in the Butte mines ; now they are returning to the mountain whence they came . Plants will be erected to mix the tailings with water ; the resulting solution will run through pipelines underground and permeate the old " gobs . " Since the " fill " material in the " gobs " has become oxidized through the years and much of the copper has become soluble , the water , brought back to the surface , will carry off copper in solution which will be recovered in a new precipitating plant . Filling the area with tailings began before the shaft was started , so this " leaching " process provided the first metal recovery from the project . To process the augmented volume of ore which will come from Butte , plant expansion and additional workers will be necessary at Anaconda , site of the reduction works , and at Great Falls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job is all done , generations hence , part of the mountain will be hollow . There will then be some subsidence of the surface ; but because the upper limit of the ore body is eight hundred feet underground and because loose , broken rocks fills twice as much space as the tightly-packed material it will replace , no awesome man-made canyon will develop . Nevertheless there will someday be a crease in Butte 's crown . V O FF shift , the workers on the new project ? along with all other Company employees , their wives , or husbands ? can avail themselves of the recreational resources of the new Employees ' Club . Twenty thousand are doing so every month . To create the Club , the Company purchased and partially rebuilt a long-vacant , five-story downtown hotel at a cost of more than $400,000 . Two floors and the basement are now in use ; the other floors may be used later for Club activities , or maybe converted into office or residential quarters . Operation of the Club costs about $5,000 a month ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first president was Hills , president of the Minors ' Union ; the present one is Richard Leary , a machinist . The manager is Johnny Good , young Butte war veteran college-trained as a recreation leader . Joe L. Markham , a local newspaper executive , represents the Company as managing director . Membership terminates when an employee " severs connections with the Company " and because of the turnover in mine employment new cards are issued every few months . However , when a brief strike of AF of L electricians ? the only test of its kind in the Club'sfirst year ? extended beyond the expiration date of current membership cards , new ones were issued for the striking craftsmen . The Club contains several lounges , a combined ballroom , movie theater , and auditorium ; restaurant and banquet kitchen ; ten bowling alleys ; soft drink and beer bars , and basement game rooms for cards , pool , shuffleboard , and other pastimes . Special events are staged at least once weekly , and popular entertainments must be repeated so night shift workers can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Questionnaires were submitted to all Butte employees to determine their major interests and the Club is constantly broadening its program : art and home-economics classes , the latter conducted by the agricultural extension service , were recently instituted . Best attended so far are bowling , community and choral singing , and entertainments presented by the diverse racial groups of Butte , usually featuring folk music and dancing . The day the Club opened ? March 16 , 1947 ? nearly 17,000 Butte citizens streamed through the building . There had been widespread skepticism : many doubted , in view of Butte 's turbulent labor history , whether such a radically new departure in employee relations could win early acceptance . But the Club filled so urgent a need in the recreationstarved town that it caught on at once . Old animosities were laid aside within its doors . " Definitely a successful venture from the start , " said the Miner 's Voice , official newspaper of Butte Miners ' Union No. 1 . That union , affiliated with the International Union of Mine , Mill , and Smelter Workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was once the union of Big Bill Haywood . The Voice now carries a regular column of Club news , as do the local dailies . Some militant unionists have complained that it has become more difficult , because of the distractions offered by the Club , to bring out the membership for meetings and to get committee work done . They acknowledge that union discipline is the local 's responsibility , but officers face criticism if they become so interested in Club activities that they neglect their union duties . So far there is little if any suspicion that the management , through the Club , seeks to promote company unionism ; extreme caution , however , will have to be exercised by the Company lest this suspicion arise and destroy the Club 's work . The Club has done more to effect a moral transformation of Butte in a year than crusades had accomplished in fifty . Gambling houses were soon complaining bitterly of " business " lost to the Club , Its basement cardrootn , where chance-minded players may risk small stakes but escape payment of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available without cost , ultimately may doom the downtown " clip joints " if nothing else does ; it is difficult to see how they can compete if the Club survives . It is this , more than any other single phase of the " new era " in Butte , that hints of a change in the Company 's community policy . Butte 's notorious " wide open " character ( at one time the Chamber of Commerce was given to boasting about it ) was popularly attributed to Company eagerness to keep its footloose miners broke so they could n't drift to other jobs . Whether the Company did actually encourage vice and gambling or merely closed its eyes to their presence , its failure to move against them contributed to the impairment of Butte 's moral fiber . But sole responsibility did not rest with the Company . The people of Butte are citizens of an American community which , despite its economic domination by one industry , is politically free . They have the privileges , and obligations , of citizenship . W. Guy Banister , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night in a pregnant speech at a Chamber of Commerce dinner . ( in Butte , everything happens at Chamber dinners ? ) Banister said : If the citizens of any community never raise their voices against the pattern in which they live , the pattern of adultery mixed with respectability , of graft mixed with the time-worn democratic slogans , of vice supporting charity and religion , and religion by inaction condoning vice , then you get the kind of law enforcement you deserve . it may not be the kind you want , but it is what you deserve . The quality of law enforcement is then a responsibility of the citizens of that community . The Ministerial Association took up Ban-ter 's challenge . One Sunday every member reached on the text , " Jesus Weeps Over Butte " ? but the aroused clerics did n't stop with exhortation , as they had before . News stories and advertisements , sermons and parochial admonitions carried on the attack . The fire was especially hot under the most vicious gambling element , the " keeno " ( bingo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their " take " the family grocery money or savings . Demands were served upon local law enforcement officers for a clean-up . They were ignored . The churches took their appeal to the State capitol in Helena . Sheriff Al McLeod of Butte received a letter from the Attorney General which he told reporters was " personal . " The gambling joints closed . The gamblers were not licked . They have a big investment and occasional shutdowns are written off as a routine business expense . Within a few weeks they were operating again ? but the embattled pastors thereupon were impressively reinforced . The Company 's Butte dailies announced , on page one , the creation of " Citizens , Incorporated , " a community association with the avowed aims of seeing that the law was enforced and promoting good citizenship . The thirty-odd incorporators included leading merchants and professional men , labor representatives , the assistant to the president of Montana Power Company , and an attorney associated with Anaconda . This distinguished outfit , unique in Montana history , immediately served a demand upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick . M ONTANA statutes are somewhat ineffectual when it comes to fixing responsibility for law enforcement ; t sere is , for instance , no provision for regular sessions of grand juries . Therefore law in the mining city may continue for a long time to be a weak reed : there is a saying that " anything can be fixed in Butte . " But the gamblers can be busted . Here again it will be the temper of the town ? public opinion as voiced by " Citizens , Incorporated " ? which will decide ; that , and the Employees ' Club , and the civic center . The civic center will be the first public playground Butte has ever had within its corporate limits . Well-equipped Columbia Gardens , gift of a " copper king " decades ago , is two miles out of town , whereas the new recreation area will be within easy reach of most of the major residential sections . Its " plant " will cost a million dollars , to be financed by a county bond issue for which petitions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attaches to the governmental unit : were it a city bond issue , Anaconda would escape relatively lightly because Butte 's founders obligingly drew the city limits so as to dodge most of the Company 's mines . But as the largest county landowner , Anaconda will be stuck for $400,000 of the bond issue , in addition to donating the site and paying additional taxes annually for the playground 's ma intenance . Although it is calling upon other Butte taxpayers to help build the recreation center , Anaconda is assuming the entire cost of the new hospital , now in the planning stage . It will be a 150-bed institution with room for expansion ; about $1,500,000 will be invested in the building and another $500,000 in equipment . The Butte Community Memorial Hospital Association , a non-profit corporation , has been created to operate it ; the trustees include several merchants , an attorney , a consulting engineer , a cement company manager , and an officer of the Engineers ' Union , CIO . The Company has no representation and will have no connection with the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation of enlarging a Catholic hospital in the smelter town of Anaconda because that institution will have to broaden its service as the new project adds employees to the plant there . THE Company 's hopes for Butte were implicit in Kelley 's speech , but some of the local executives are given much of the credit by their fellow townsmen for the apparent reorientation of A.C.M. policy . For the first time , the business community and even a lot of the miners appear to feel that the " sixth floor 's " concern for Butte is not only enlightened employment practice but also reflects the fact that some of the bosses really like the place . It is no secret that the Anaconda 's executives did n't care for Gunther 's unflattering appraisal of Montana , their Company , and Butte in Inside U.S.A. , and they probably were not pleased when that best-selling book carried his astringent report into hundreds of thousands of American homes . The average Butte reader , it is safe to venture , was no happier about it : in private conversation he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a bellyful of uninvited social diagnosticians and tends more and more to resent their published findings . ( He will resent this one . ) " On the Montana level , " Gunther wrote , " the company is criticized on a number of scores . " He listed seven , with supporting detail : " incomparable and monumental " stinginess ; political domination of the State ; vindictiveness toward opponents ; the development of defeatist attitudes in the citizenry ; discouragement of new industry ; control of the press ; and inadequate support of education . On the Butte level the Company would seem now to be making some progress toward elimination of complaint Number One . That does not herald a Montana millennium by any means ; it would be na ? ve to read such magnanimity into the Company 's hardheaded plans for its subject city . Nor does the Company 's spending , welcome as it may i be in Butte , look like extravagance : Anaconda 's net income reached a record high of $42,500,000 last year . Nevertheless it 's a start . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the eradication of defeatism , prosperity and enlightened management policy in Butte p can be a big help ? but the people of Montana have a job to do , too .
