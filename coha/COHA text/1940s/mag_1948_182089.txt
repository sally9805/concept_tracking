Like Britain 's Princess Elizabeth , Egypt 's Queen Farida was once an enthusiastic Girl Guide . Unlike Elizabeth , she never bore a son , and in Egypt , where only male heirs count , that can be important . <P> Born Sasi Naz Zulficar , the daughter of a prominent judge in Alexandria 's Mixed Court of Appeals , Farida ( " Peerless " ) had other drawbacks as a queen in Islam . Before her marriage she had shocked orthodox Moslems with her Western ways . She dressed in the latest Paris fashions , swam and danced with vigor , and mixed freely with the cosmopolites in Alexandria 's foreign colony . Her courtship by Egypt 's young King Farouk had been a riotous affair during which the two were often seen careering through Cairo in Farouk 's snappy speedster or dancing together at Shepheard 's . Although some 400 Egyptians were trampled to death or otherwise injured in the jubilation that followed the wedding , all might have been well if only Farida had had a son . But three times during the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each time it was a princess . <P> Rocky Roads . By 1944 Farida was as discouraged over Farouk 's endless procession of mistresses as he was over her sonlessness ; she left her husband 's bed &; board and set up housekeeping alone . The king asked his advisers ' permission to divorce her , but the politicians said , " Wait . " Farida had sworn to remarry . If she had a son by another man that would look bad for Farouk . He waited . But last week , as the news of Britain 's princeling reverberated around the world , he could wait no longer . " The will of Allah , " he announced through his ministers , " directed the hearts of King Farouk and Queen Farida to a desire for divorce in spite of all the regret they feel . " <P> At the same moment another royal romance went aground-that of Farouk 's sister and Farida 's childhood playmate , 27-year-old Princess Fawzia with the Shah of Persia . Since the day in 1939 when she was palmed off on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met , to cement relations between his country and hers , blue-eyed Fawzia 's marriage had traveled much the same rocky road as her brother 's . <P> Lithe , svelte Fawzia , considered one of the most beautiful women in the world , was every bit as Westernized as her friend Farida . She never learned to like her new home . Mohamed Reza Pahlevi built her a palace in Teheran and cast off two mistresses to show his devotion , but it did no good . Fawzia bore him one child-a girl-but she refused to speak his language or attend public functions . <P> By Mutual Accord . In 1945 , pleading ill health , she left Persia for a visit to Egypt . She never came back . Mohamed Reza blamed her brother Farouk for influencing her against him . Meanwhile , the young Shah 's father , tough old self-made Reza Shah Pahlevi , died in exile in South Africa and Mohamed Reza made arrangements to bring his body back to Persia . The body was duly shipped via Cairo , where the Egyptians sidetracked it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persians have been dickering over a suitable divorce settlement for Fawzia . " No settlement , no body " was Egypt 's stand in the matter . Persia refused to submit to any such " disrespectful blackmail . "
