By February 1930 , one Wall Street broker had had enough of a good thing , was ready to get out while the getting was good . His name : Charles Edward Merrill . His firm : Merrill Lynch &; Co . His fortune : a comfortable eight-digit one . Out of broking , Merrill Lynch continued as an underwriting and investment house , specializing in equity securities of growing chain-store systems . Its babies : Safeway Stores , First National Stores , McCrory Stores , Lerner , Kresge , Western Auto Supply . <P> Heir to Merrill Lynch 's brokerage business was E. A. Pierce &; Co. , whose handsomely pompadoured , soft-spoken Edward Allen Pierce prides himself on operating the largest U. S. security &; commodity brokerage chain : 40 offices in 38 cities , linked by 17,000 miles of private wires . To the rest of Wall Street , during the dead markets of recent years , Broker Pierce has been the No. 1 example of conspicuous luxury , operating on a nationwide overhead geared to forgotten **27;8003;TOOLONG days . Ever since Depression II , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he would start dismantling offices or throw in the sponge . Last week , Ed Pierce fooled them , consolidated with Friend Merrill ( and a Merrill Lynch subsidiary , Cassatt &; Co. , Inc. ) to form a new firm of underwriter-brokers - Merrill Lynch , E. A. Pierce &; Cassatt . <P> In the Street 's Winchellian political terminology , Pierce has been called a New Dealer because of his backing of the 1938 Conway Committee revolt ( TIME , Feb. 7 , 1938 ) which purged the Old Guard from Stock Exchange leadership , installed young , earnest Bill McChesney Martin on Sing Sing First Baseman Dick Whitney 's throne . But Broker Pierce 's merger with an underwriter has little to do with the New Deal , more to do with his notorious optimism . Favorite Pierce dictum : " I 'd rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and half-right . " But his latest move follows the classic pattern of the late Financier E. H. Harriman. who always bought at the bottom . Wall Street , long in the dumps ( a Stock Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to Optimist Pierce and Realist Merrill become a buy again . <P> One reason for their confidence is Pierce 's little-reckoned-with commodity trading department . In 1939 , E. A. Pierce grossed about $9,000,000 , of which commissions on commodity trading accounted for a little more than $1,000,000 , securities business the rest . Given offices and a wire service , which Pierce had anyway for his securities business , commodity brokerage involves no costly physical handling , no more plant than a set of books . Hence , this end of the business earned enough to keep the Pierce operating deficit at only about $300,000 ( after 6% interest on capital ) , less than the total salaries drawn by 19 Pierce partners .
