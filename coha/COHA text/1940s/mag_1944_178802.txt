As the Salt Lake City Tribune 's first woman reporter , redheaded Florabel Muir wanted to become the first woman to cover an execution . Utah law said executions could be witnessed only by men . Florabel dickered , fumed , finally got the State Attorney General to rule that she was a reporter , not a female . <P> Born in Rock Springs , Wyo. in 1900 , Florabel roughed out a semi-frontier childhood with ten brothers and sisters . After graduation from the University of Washington , she tried schoolteaching , dropped it for reporting . The newspaper circuit took her to the Chicago Herald-Examiner , the now extinct San Francisco Journal , the tabloid New York Daily News , then back to Los Angeles . <P> For 25 years , shrill , tough Florabel has been working on a no-quarter basis , is supposedly the first woman to be admitted to the rim of a Pacific Coast copy desk , is known to be equipped with a sulphurous vocabulary . She gets news in brusque , traditional police reporter fashion , chases ambulances at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing is straight , sometimes awkward , always humorless . <P> In Hollywood when the Mary Astor divorce story broke , Florabel got a call from the Daily News to cover it . She promptly bought the Astor diary for $500 , made the trial the sizzling success of the ' 30s . Her other top stories were the Pantages , Clara Bow , the Errol Flynn and Chaplin trials . On the Chaplin story Florabel went to see Joan Berry at the Beverly Hills police station , advised her to retain Attorney Jack Irwin , thereby sewed up the best source . Other reporters rewrote her , or did n't write . <P> Take It Easy . Her legend is prodigious . Once she went to Agua Caliente with Columnist Louella Parsons and Husband Docky Martin . In the gents ' room of a Caliente tavern , Docky became involved with several brawling Mexicans . Miss Parsons , hearing the rumpus , asked Florabel what to do . " Hell , " shouted Florabel , " rescue the poor bastard ! " Forthwith , she dived into the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Last year Florabel bought control of the wavering Los Angeles City News Service , saw it waver still more when she was unable to staff it with experienced newsgatherers . Last week , tired , ailing , beaten for the first time , she announced she would shut up shop on Armistice Day . Said she : " I was having a talk with my croaker the other day . He says , ' Florabel , your ticker ai n't worth a pot in hell-you take it easy . ' So I guess I will . "
