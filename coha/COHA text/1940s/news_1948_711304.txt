txt Mortar bombs struck Christian churches at the Third and Sixth Stations of the Cross today , scattering debris over the Way of Sorrows . Their red  --  tile roofs were shattered . Three refugee children were wounded slightly . A Trans-Jordan Arab legion commander said the bombs came from Jewish mortars in violation of an understanding to hold fire in the Holy City . He ordered his artillery to begin a bombardment of Jewish targets 10 limes as heavy as Jewish fire . The church of the Armenian Catholic patriarchate , where Jesus is said to have fallen under the weight of the cross , and the Greek Catholic church of St. Veronica , traditional spot where Veronica , wiped the face of Jesus were damaged by the bombs . Christian refugees , crowded into the Church of St. Veronica , were paralyzed with fright as the rubble and steel fragments fell before the altar . Virtually all the churches in the old city have been converted into havens for refugees . The St. Veronica church shelters six families .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
