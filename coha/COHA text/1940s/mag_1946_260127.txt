When little Jimmy Jeans was born in 1877 , science was smug and dull . It considered the universe a mere machine governed by well-known laws . When Sir James Hopwood Jeans ( O.M. ; M.A. ; D.Sc. ; LL.D. ; D.L. ; F.R.S. ) died in England last week at 69 , the universe had once again become a mystery , and- thanks to war-conscripted science-a dangerous mystery . <P> But between the publication of Einstein 's Theory of Special Relativity ( 1905 ) and the explosion of the first atomic bomb ( 1945 ) , science had a glorious period never equaled before . On dozens of fronts it swept ahead . From laboratories and observatories , from scholars ' quiet studies in rapid succession came startling discoveries , most of them wrapped in an opaque web of higher mathematics . <P> Sir James Jeans was a leading interpreter of this Golden Age . Jeans started as a lecturer at Cambridge , England , then was summoned to Princeton in 1905 by the University 's president , Woodrow Wilson . There Jeans taught applied mathematics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1910 he went back to Cambridge , turned to astronomy . Always a theoretician rather than an observer , he published formidable papers which won him a reputation among brother scientists . Typical title : The Mathematical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism ; Atomicity and Quanta . <P> About the only Jeans theory which can be explained to laymen presents a possible origin of the solar system . If another star , Jeans argued mathematically , ever passed near the sun , it may have pulled out a streamer of gas . This , cooling , may have formed the planets . <P> If Jeans had stuck to his astronomical knitting , only scientists would ever have heard of him . But he was that great rarity , a first-rate scientist with a command of lucid English . Starting in the late 1920s , he wrote a series of best-selling books* which brought the new discoveries of science , unblemished by errors or indignity , down to the popular level . <P> The service was desperately needed , for science had far outrun popular understanding . Relativity was nearly a generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer layers of the public mind . The Quantum Theory , perhaps even more important , was even less understood . People needed to know that stars were no longer points in space , but convenient physical laboratories , observed through fantastic instruments . People needed to be told that the atom had fallen apart , had dissolved into lesser particles . <P> With limpid , vivid clarity , Jeans explained the mysteries . He did not stop work as a scientist , but gradually his scientific work took second place . He lectured , played the lion , his comings &; goings across the Atlantic became almost public events . <P> As Jeans grew older , he gradually became preoccupied with abstract philosophy . Sample problem : Is the material world an illusion , and thought the only reality ? Such abstractions hold small interest for most of the modern public , and Jeans 's last book , Physics and Philosophy , was little read . <P> Sir Arthur Eddington , Jeans 's closest rival , died in 1 B.B. ( Before the Bomb ) . Jeans himself died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take their place . So far , the terrifying discoveries of the nuclear physicists have found no comparable interpreters . <P>
