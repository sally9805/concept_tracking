I Know My Love ( adapted from the French of Marcel Achard by S.N. Behrman ; produced by the Theatre Guild &; John C. Wilson ) may run for years with the Lunts in it ; without them , it would hardly last a week . Not since the perfection of the chocolate-covered peppermint has anything so thin also been so gooey . But with that delightful absorption in themselves that renders them oblivious to their surroundings , the Lunts are as arch , as expert and as enjoyable here as elsewhere . <P> They are first shown as a Boston Brahmin couple giving a family party on their golden wedding day . Though pretty messy for the family , things are golden for the Lunts . Then the play wanders sentimentally back across the years , offering an assortment of period costumes , family tragedies , marital crises and extramarital complications . Alfred , for whom every age proves a dangerous age , is incurably romantic and roving . Lynn , facing one ticklish domestic situation after another , knows the wise wife 's formula for holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzle . <P> Given half a chance , the pair of them , with their timing , their teamwork , their contrapuntal growls and purrs , can put any scene across . And now &; then , amid large blobs of stage custard , Playwright Behrman obliges with a nice witticism about husbands or Boston . But unhappily there are long stretches in I Know , My Love when there is neither any play on the stage nor any Lunts.
