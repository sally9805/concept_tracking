In a time of corporate , impersonal journalism , doughty old John Netherland Heiskell is a holdout . The lean and gimlet-eyed boss of Little Rock 's Arkansas Gazette snorts at the notion that a newspaper is just a 6% investment : it is first of all an institution , says he , and only incidentally a business . Because his paper is a great success in both roles , numerous buyers have greedily eyed it . Heiskell has always talked to them as sternly as if they were asking for the hand of one of his two daughters . <P> Last week , tired of turning down unsuitable suitors , he took steps to keep " The Old Lady , " as Arkansans call the state 's biggest and most respected daily , in the family . For around $750,000 , he bought the Gazette stock ( 25% ) that was not already held by Heiskells . He also named ex-Army Major Hugh B. Patterson Jr. , his capable , 33-year-old son-in-law , as his paper 's publisher . ( Son Carrick Heiskell , an Army pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <P> All Is Confusion . Not that Editor Heiskell was in any hurry to let go . At 76 , he still gets to his office about 8 in the morning . The office , piled high with books and papers , is more cluttered than William Allen White 's used to be at another famed Gazette , in Emporia . Once a reporter asked for a typewriter he had seen buried in the office , and Heiskell crustily denied that it was there . A janitor dug in and found not one machine but six . " If they 'd dug a little deeper , " cracked a newsman , " they 'd probably have found a dead reporter . " <P> The Gazette , which began its 130th year last week , was founded by Printer William Woodruff , who ferried his press from Tennessee by canoe . " Mister J.N. " Heiskell , who also came from Tennessee , has run it for the last 46 years . He has fought against governors and utilities , and for equal ( but separate ) opportunities for Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rival Democrat , but Heiskell soon got them divorced . He likes to tell fellow Southern publishers that if they do n't spend money to get good editorial pages , they should n't blame their readers for not reading them . His own editorials ( which he reads aloud to make sure they can stand it ) get read . All through the 1948 campaign , the Gazette dad-blamed the Dixiecrats , stuck with Truman , " advised " voters to do the same . Arkansas did , by a 60% vote . <P> A Hearing for Henry . A teetotaler who bars liquor ads ( but not beer ads ) from his paper , Mister J.N. is a tolerant man . When Henry Wallace came to town during his campaign , Heiskell gave him free time on the Gazette 's radio station to make sure that he got a fair hearing . ( It was Wallace 's own fault that his interview with Executive Editor Harry Ashmore made damning reading in next day 's Gazette . ) <P> Heiskell 's tolerance also permits a daily column in the staid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigar-chomping , self-confessed sinner who used to run a suburban gambling house . Spider writes about his bouts with " wobble water , " refers to young girls as " quails , " and brags about his encounters with the law . Spider wrote in a recent column : " I attribute my outstanding ability to kiss to blowing a bugle for a couple of years with the Boy Scouts . "
