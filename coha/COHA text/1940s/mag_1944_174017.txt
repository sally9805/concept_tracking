One evening in February 1942 Harper &; Brothers ' Board Chairman Henry Hoyns tuned in on We , the People , heard the easygoing drawl of a preacher recounting his experiences in the Ozark Mountains . The publishers promptly asked the parson to write his autobiography . Last week it was published . Walkin ' Preacher of the Ozarks ( $2.50 ) by the Rev. Guy Howard , crammed with colorful hillbilly tales , is a lively account of an itinerant minister 's work in isolated Ozark hamlets of southern Missouri and northern Arkansas . <P> " Furriner " in the Ozarks . A onetime farmer and teacher in his native Iowa , 52-year-old Guy Howard felt the Gospel call ten years ago . Although his Ozark people love him now , many of them resented him at first , even to the extent of burning down his school . He was " a furriner " and it took him a long time to live down the mountaineers ' suspicion that his Bible was just a disguise to hide a revenue officer 's badge . <P> Preacher Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now an ordained Disciples of Christ minister ) , but he was short on denominationalism , long on the love of God . He walked up &; down the hills , holding revival meetings wherever he could gather a crowd . <P> Unlike some Ozark preachers , Howard never whipped his listeners into frenzied praying and testimony . He spoke gently of redemption , taught that Christianity is greater than any single church , that its great message is brotherly love and service . <P> Said one mountaineer : " Shorely must be aworkin ' fer the Lord fer ye hai n't beggin ' fer money nor atalkin ' denomination . " <P> In his decade of preaching and teaching , Howard has walked some 4,000 miles a year . His people have often given him clothing and food , but his actual salary has averaged $14 a month . Last week the first printing ( 5,000 copies ) of his book was nearly exhausted , a second printing was in preparation , and a Hollywood producer was dickering for the cinema rights . <P> Moonshine and Confession . Longtime curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been moonshining . One of his book 's most poignant chapters concerns his watch by the bedside of a delirious 14-year-old boy dying in agony of fusel-oil poisoning after drinking moonshine . The boy 's eyeballs bled and he screamed : " Git my eyes , Pappy ; they 's rollin ' off the bed . " When the boy died , Preacher Howard had a hard time dissuading an uncle from going out with his shotgun to find the man who gave the boy the liquor . Said the uncle after Howard prayed and pleaded with him for two hours : " Here take this gun lest I change my mind-killin 's too good for them Saxons . " <P> Preacher Howard has baptized hundreds of Ozark people . One of his strangest converts was an old granny . The blind old woman summoned him to her cabin , said : " From what I heerd about ye , preacher , I reckon I kin trust ye ter keep a secret . Hit 's always been a deep sorrer in my life , I kin tell ye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows . But , preacher , I feel I ai n't much longer fer this world and I jist got ta confess hit ter somebody .
