THE AGE OF JACKSON-Arthur Schlesinger Jr. - Little , Brown ( $5 ) . <P> Once upon a time , when the Yewnited States was just a little shaver among the nations , but already very spoiled along the literate Eastern fringes , there lived younder in Tennessee a lovable old man with a tongue like a rat-tailed file and a face so hard they called him Old Hickory . He was a great hero . In the War of 1812 , he licked the British in the Battle of Noo Orleens ( some time after peace had been made ) . Everybody loved him because he had come up the hard way from nothing to a plantation and owning slaves , but he never forgot the COMMON MAN . Sitting on his plantation porch of an evening , he would say : " I still love the COMMON MAN , " and , with a jet of tobacco juice slanchwise between the Ionic columns , would drown a doodlebug at five yards . So they called him the SAGE of The Hermitage ( his plantation ) . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains , lived a very wicked man . His name was Nicholas Biddle . He was president of the Yewnited States Bank , which was a wily scheme to get hard money away from the COMMON MAN and give him scraps of paper in exchange . This Biddle was a bad actor . He did not eat with his knife and he foregathered with cronies who drank soup in silence so they could hear each other plot against the COMMON MAN . They were called Federalists . They held that some of the COMMON MEN could be hoodwinked all of the time , and that that was enough . They plotted to keep the COMMON MAN from being hoodwinked by anybody else . <P> One day Old Hickory got so mad he roared : " My name is Andrew Jackson , fresh from the backwoods , half-horse , half-alligator , a little touched with snapping turtle . I can wade the Mississippi , leap the Ohio , ride a streak of lightning , slip without a scratch down the honey locust , whip my weight in wildcats , hug a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the COMMON MAN ! Come on , boys , let 's get Nicholas Biddle . " <P> So all the peckerwoods and rednecks and the big planters from the South ( who did not like the tariff ) and the farmers from the West ( who did not like the Bank ) , they voted Old Hickory to be the seventh President of the Yewnited States . Then they all marched to Washington . Old Hickory kicked Nicholas Biddle higher than the day before yesterday and the Yewnited States Bank higher than the day before next . Then they all went to the White House for free grog and climbed over the fancy chairs with muddy boots . Everybody got jobs with the Government because , as Old Hickory said : " To the victors belong the spoils ! " And everybody agreed that it was democracy at work . <P> Everybody , that is , except the Federalists , who were right pokey about it and thought that democracy could be made to work quite well without the cowhide boots , and that the great thing about democracy was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common .
