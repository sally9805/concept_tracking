Two facts from the Near East last week renewed an old medical quarrel . When Dr. Edward L. Turner of Nashville was practicing medicine in Beirut , some time ago , he noticed a curious thing : every year in the late autumn his stomach-ulcer patients got worse . Late autumn was the time of the orange harvest , and the people of Syria are great orange eaters . Hmm , said Dr. Turner . <P> As Dr. Turner knew , gastroenterologists do not agree on whether or not ulcer diets should contain orange juice . The juice contains citric acid only in harmless traces , but it might stimulate the stomach to produce a more than normal amount of hydrochloric acid . Because they feared hydrochloric acid , some doctors banned orange juice ; others prescribed it to keep up the vitamin C intake . Ulcer patients without enough vitamin C are in a bad way . <P> With two other Nashville physicians , Frank W. Claytor and William L. Smith , Dr. Turner devised an experiment , reported its results last week in The American Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects , took stomach samples after feeding . At other times they gave the same subjects equivalent amounts of 1 ) soft toast and tea ; 2 ) rich milk . In all but two patients , the stomach acid averaged 75% higher after the orange juice than after the other diets . It looked as though ulcer patients should get their vitamin C from something else than orange juice . But the doctors were too cautious to say so definitely ; they wanted still more facts .
