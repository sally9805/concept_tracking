Agile Austin . On the Indianapolis Motor Speedway , an Austin convertible set a new U.S. speed record for open stock cars , a mark most auto makers are not interested in . Despite several stops for repairs ( see cut ) , the Austin covered 11,850 miles in seven days , for an average speed of 70.54 m.p.h. ( old record : 68.58 m.p.h . ) . A few days later , the Austin Motor Co. , Ltd. , did something U.S. automakers were interested in . It cut prices $1,000 on the record-setting model . The new price : $2,795 with a manually operated top , $180 more with a hydraulically operated top . <P> Fair : Poor . The first postwar German trade fair in the U.S. , sponsored by the Allied Military Government , finished its 16-day stand in Manhattan . Orders were heaviest for china ( $250,000 ) , office machinery ( $120,000 ) and cameras and optical instruments ( $100,000 ) . Total business was a low $1,200,000 , but the Germans hoped the sample orders would eventually bring many more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Safety is no accident , " last week completed its 19th year without a serious accident , the longest accident-free period for any U.S. airline . Colonial has flown 250,545,622 passenger miles without death or serious injury to any passenger or crew member . <P> Room at the Top . Chicago management consultants Booz , Allen &; Hamilton queried 65 corporations , found that U.S. executives are now seven years older ( average age : 54 ) than their 1929 counterparts . Other findings : average age of corporation presidents is 59 today v. 53 in 1929 ; senior officers now average 55 , compared with 48 in 1929 ; junior officers average 52 , compared with 46 . The firm 's conclusion : replacements , which were slowed down by the war , will probably be rapid in the next five to ten years . <P> Quick Pickup . In high dudgeon , the American Automobile Association last week asked major U.S. oil companies why , with oil in surplus , had the price of gasoline gone up just as motorists were getting ready for summer driving ? While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corp . cut prices if a gallon in Kansas City , the first sizable cut in gasoline prices since war 's end . <P> Swearing Off . To christen a new 4,000-h.p. diesel-electric locomotive in Cleveland last week , the Erie Railroad used , instead of champagne , a bottle of locomotive smoke . The Erie thus marked the complete conversion from steam to diesels on its Cleveland passenger runs .
