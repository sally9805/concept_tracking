txt BANK CURB ASKED BY MORGENTHAll ON PROJECT LOANS ' Association Is Urged to Bar Credits Which Compete With Defense for Materials BEFORE PRIORITY IS SET This Will Strike ' at Source ' of Inflation  --  Bankers Call for Complete Price Control By EDWARD J. CONDLON Special to Tas NEW Torts Timms . CHICAGO , Oct. 2 ? Secretary Morgenthau urged several thousand bankers here today to postpone loans for non-defense projects that would involve competition for materials urgently needed for the nation 's defense effort . He asked them to take this action without waiting for the government 's priorities list to become broader , in a speech at the concluding session of the American Bankers Association 's convention . " Scrutinize closely your lists of applications for loans , " he said . " These lists contain ' within them much of the ammunition of inflation . You have in your hands , therefore , one of the most effective weapons for checking inflation at its source . You are sure to find many applications for money for nondefense projects that would involve competition for steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now needed so- desperately for our defense effort . Asks Bankers to Help " If you can postpone all such unnecessary loans until a later day , " he continued , " without waiting for the priorities to become broader , you will be doing a real and lasting service for your country . I hope that in the not too distant future the priority system will become so effective that the supply of practicalltr all raw materials for all purposes will be under full control in the interests of national defense . But until that day comes , I hope that you will constitute yourselves the sentinels of the nation , in your own bank and your own community , in guarding against any private encroachment upon the stock of resources needed for the national effort . " The Secretary called on the bankers to teach the peoples of their // LOAN CURB URGED BY IORGENTHAU // respective communities the facts about inflation and defense financing . Their influence collectively and individually , he said , would be joined with that of the government in its efforts to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of convincing the average citizen , right now , he continued , that he will have to accept far greater taxation . Next year 's tax bill , he warned , will have to be a genuinely " allout " bill , a genuine levy upon all in accordance with their ability to pay , if it is to raise the necessary revenue , place the necessary check upon inflation , and take the profit out of war . " It will require all-out effort on our part to tip the scales in this war , " he declared . " It will require every ounce of strength that our giant industrial system can give . It will demand sweat and sacrifice on the part of producers , workers , managers and consumers alike . And it will mean the greatest public expenditure that has ever been pumped into the arteries of our economic system . " Defense expenditures have now risen slowly to more than a billion and a quarter dollars a month . They will soon be a billion arid a half , but even then they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadequate ' is too mild and charitable a word . We are trying to make ourselves the arsenal of democracy by devoting only 20 per cent of our factory and mining output to defense , only 30 per cent of our output of durable goods , only 10 per cent of our output of non-durable goods , and only 16 per cent of our national income . That , surely , is very far from total defense or all-out effort . " Nobody can emphasize too often or too strongly the magnitude of the job which we American people have set out to do . Let me give you a few simple illustrations : " At present prices the cost of the total defense program as now planned will be more than $50,000 , - 000,000 . This is $10,000,000,000 more than the original value of all building construction in the United States since 1927 . It is twice as much as the total investment in American railways . It is twice as much as the total value of all passenger automobiles produced in this country during the past fourteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without inflation is ' all-but taxation , ' he said , " a method that has not yet been tried in spite of the good start that Congress made in raising $3,500 , - 000,000 in additional revenue . With the help of the new Revenue Act of 1941 , our structure will yield about $14,000,000,000 in revenue , but in my opinion it still contains many inequalities and many omissions which will have to be corrected next year . " Mr. Morganthau did not allude in his address to his recent statement that all corporate profits above 6 per cent should be taxed 100 per cent . In response to questions by reporters after his speech , the Secretary declined to discuss this subject . In praising the bankers for their whole-hearted cooperation in the sales of defense savings bonds , the Secretary stated that the Treasury would no longer require the banks to put up collateral for Series E defense bonds which they keep in stock for their customers . This , he said , would relieve the banks , especially the small banks , of a real burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any similar burdens which might be hampering defense bond sales . " The kind of spending that the Treasury is most anxious to divert into defense savings bonds is the spending produced by pay increases and bonuses , and by increased dividend payments , " the said . " I should like to offer as a suggestion that every Christmas bonus in the United States be paid this year in defense savings bonds or stamps . The banks of America can start this fashion so that it will sweep the country . " Wider savings and greater taxes will not , of course , be enough in themselves , to cope with the inflation that now confronts us . The government already has powerful weapons of control in its hands . If it needs more power in the fight against rising prices and falling living standards it will ask Congress for that power . It is now asking for additional power through the price-control bill , which I hope will be passed by Congress without delay . " A combination of emergency taxes , priorities , savings and pricecontrol will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice . We are engaged in a world struggle that demands all our energies and all the qualities that have made America great . As a result of that effort we are compelled to fight another enemy , the enemy of inflation , on the home front . How can we hope to win unless we first throw into the rubbish heap all ideas of business as usual , pleasures as usual and comforts as usual . " Discussing the savings program , he said : " We at the Treasury believe that the voluntary defense savings pro-1 gram has already . awakened a greater sense of pride in America and a greater sense of participa-tion in the national effort . We I shall continue along that road of voluntary cooperation , and I am perfectly confident that we shall reach vast numbers who are will-1 ing and eager to put their savings to work for their country . " In this effort the Treasury will continue to depend greatly upon the bankers of America , not only as its agents in selling Defense Bonds but also as missionaries in spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The defense savings program has now been in progress for five months . It has yielded us a billion and a half dollars from two and one-half million individual investors . The result so far is certainly not below our expectations , but just as certainly it falls far short of our needs . It falls short especially in that it has only begun to reach workers ' payrolls . " I can find no usefulness , for our present purposes , in the old Liberty Loan method of fixing money quotas for communities , trades , labor unions , school classes or individuals ilk this Defense Savings Program . I can see no value , either in terms of economics or of morale , in high-pressuring people to take money out of bank savings accounts or out of life insurance . But I do see a great benefit , financial and moral , in persuading spenders to set aside , systematically , week after week , a part of their current income for their own good and their country 's good . " " In my opinion , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of weakness today in building our defenses . We can conquer inflation on the home front if we act now , just as we can ensure the death of foreign tyranny if we rouse ourselves in " time . " Senator Connally of Texas , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , said in an address to the convention that any lingering doubts that may remain in the minds of some groups in the United States as to the designs of the Nazi regime on South America and this country are now fast disappearing . He warned that if Russia collapsed , the Nazis would seek a quick victory over England , and that Spain and Portugal might fall into Nazi hands in the meanwhile . Senator Connally repeated his recent demands that the Neutrality Act be modified . The convention concluded with the report of the resolutions committee , headed by Francis M. Law , president of the First National Bank of Houston , Texas , which called for the speeding up of the defense effort and the adoption of drastic means to curb inflation . The committee recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements entering into these prices , and that no pressure groups be allowed unfair advantage over other citizens . It approved the creation by Congress of a joint committee to investigate Federal expenditures and to recommend the reduction of non-essential spending . It was also recommended that care be taken in taxation not to destroy private enterprise , and that the tax base be made as broad as possible , adding that " represen. tation without taxation may be as Vicious as taxation without representation .
