One dawning last week a tired , chubby suburbanite was driving home through the outskirts of Detroit . In front of the Methodist Church at Farmington his eyelids dropped , the front wheels fluttered , the car curved , careened , crashed into the back of a parked truck . So died a rootin ' , tootin ' , shootin ' , hell-for-leather buckaroo - radio 's Lone Ranger . As founder of the five-year-old Lone Ranger Safety Club , he had broadcast many a strong appeal for careful driving . <P> All over the U.S. that night hundreds of thousands of children to whom the Ranger had sent toy lariats , six-shooters , ten-gallon hats and bristling wild west mustaches , whom he had commissioned Rangers and pledged to good conduct and fair play , mourned the most adored character ever to be created on the U.S. air . Many an older listener mourned too . The New York Times sounded the following editorial requiem : The Lone Ranger , under that name , came into being in this generation for a radio public , but under various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Ulysses , William Tell and Robin Hood ; he was Richard the Lionhearted , the Black Prince and Du Guesclin ; he was Kit Carson , Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett ; he was honest , truthful and brave-and so he remains . <P> In real life , the Ranger was Earle Graser , who liked to garden and play badminton and who did n't learn to ride a horse until a couple of years ago . He was 32 years old , a graduate of Wayne ( Mich . ) University who studied law two years , then took up acting in tent shows throughout Michigan . He got a job with Detroit 's station WXYZ , which was losing money in those days . <P> Late in 1932 WXYZ 's President George Washington Trendle got the idea that what he and radio needed was a William S. Hart of the air . Scripter Francis Striker , who had been grinding out a series called Warner Lester , Manhunter , concocted a story about a mysterious and gallant cowboy who fought against injustice of all sorts on the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen actors to be tried out , had just the right voice for the part-strong , romantic and confidence-winning . <P> Mr. Trendle never had to worry about money again . Last year the Ranger netted him a half-million dollars . The program , carried over some 80 MBS stations , and 75 independent stations spotted all over the U.S. , accumulated 20,000,000 listeners , innumerable bread , candy and pop sponsors . It also goes on transcribed recordings in Australia , New Zealand , Hawaii , Canada . <P> The Ranger galloped into the films , comic strips and novelty business . Mr. Striker got $10,000 a year , Mr. Graser $7,500 . <P> To select Actor Graser 's successor was no difficult business . On hand in WXYZ studios was Brace Beemer , who played the Ranger in the program 's early days , was transformed into a narrator when Earle Graser took over . He will be the new Ranger .
