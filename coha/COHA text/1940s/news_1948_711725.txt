txt " I guess I was too late writing you last year . That 's why I 'm writing You earlier now . " That is just one of many letters which show the faith a child has in Santa Claus . Santa 's best excuses , it shows , are written for him by the same boys and girls he has disappointed in the past . A bundle of such letters , written by Chicago 's dependent and neglected children , has been turned over to The Tribune Good Fellow department by several charitable agencies because the Good Fellows are the only ones who can help out . The letters admit all sorts of reasons why Santa did n't come last year  --  but they never hit the right one . " Fin In The Chimey " Here are some others : " Mom said you diddnt come last year becaus I never did ( things ) when she told me to . I 'm much better now .... but she died . " " I did n't mind about last year because I had to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famiy upstairs had a fire in the chimey ( last year ) but they wont this year . " " If you 're too busy again this year , I can help . Give me a sack and tell me where to go . ' ' I The trouble Is that Santa Claus alone wo n't be able to help these children any more than he did last year ? no matter how early they write , how obedient they are , how badly they want a gift , or how comfortable it is in their chimney . The last letter came close to the point . But the help Santa needs is not In delivering th , gifts , It is in getting them . Fill An Important Gap That is where the Good Fellows come in . With only a little trouble , they can fill In an important gap . This does n't involve teaching children to expect charity . It 's fulfilling a childish faith in Santa . So fill in the coupon on page 6 and mail it in now , before it 's too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday evening . You 'll be advised of the name or . names of one or more children , as you request , and what they want for Christmas . Ifyou do n't havetime todo this , you can send money which will be used to help the , children who never get assigned to a gift-giving Good Fellow .
