Last week the biggest thing mankind has ever made began to spurt power . As Grand Coulee 's first bolt of electricity sped to Bonneville 's Government-owned transmission lines , it signaled the start of another round in an old , old fight : public v. private power . <P> To the people of the Pacific Northwest , public power is nothing new . Seattle has had a municipal utility since 1905 , and some other towns in Washington and Ore gon have had them even longer . But behind these scattered outposts lies a web of big private systems , covering a far wider area than the famed British grid . Eleven of them have combined assets of well over $400,000,000 . But compared with Grand Coulee and Bonneville , the Northwest 's private power resources are minuscule . When they reach their combined ultimate capacity of 2,438,400 kilowatts , the Bonneville Power Administration ( which administers the output of both dams ) will be the biggest dispenser of electricity in the world . <P> Boss of all this public power is a grave , greying New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BPA administrator in 1939 . Dr. Raver 's ambition is to put every kilowatt in the Northwest under public ownership . Backed by the White House and his two titanic dams , he has moved steadily toward this end . Said President Franklin Thomas Griffith of Portland General Electric Co. : " It is axiomatic that no private utility can compete with the Treasury of the U. S. " <P> But the path of socialized power has not always run smooth . Dr. Raver 's eager hands were partly tied by the original BPA legislation , which permits BPA to buy or build transmission lines and distribution equipment , but not to buy whole companies . ( Now in Congress is a bill to give BPA this power . ) Fifteen months after Bonneville 's generators started purring , the project 's first report ruefully admitted it had only one short-term customer , no transmission lines . Anti-Federal news papers headlined : " Bonneville Dam Has Everything But Customers . " Meanwhile Dr. Raver 's predecessor , the late James Delmage Ross , began to go after business through Municipals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Bonneville Act . <P> Mr. Ross soon found that the PUDs were not the handy tools they seemed . Able ( unlike Bonneville ) to take over power companies entire , they often spoiled Ross 's plans by refusing to do so , buying plants and lines piecemeal instead . By early 1939 the citizens of 14 PUDs in Washington had gone to the polls , but only seven of them voted to use Bonneville power ; the others turned it down . Some claimed their own steam plants were cheaper - almost lese majesty in the Columbia River Valley . <P> Worst blow was delivered last year in Eugene , Ore. , whose citizens turned down Bonneville power . This left 125 miles of Bonneville transmission lines , built in hopes of a big new customer , with almost no place to go . Four months later Portland turned down Bonneville too . So , this month , did Tacoma and Spokane . In these riotous elections the PUDs and the private utilities sometimes made cause against BPA . Dr. Raver 's own campaigning was often vitriolically abetted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections by introducing the Federal interference issue into an already three-cornered fight .
