Children appeared at nightfall as if conjured up by magicians . They skipped from house to house with secretly printed bulletins calling for new mass demonstrations against British rule during the week of Mohandas K. Gandhi 's 73rd birthday . <P> When the day came , followers of Gandhi 's Indian National Congress party picketed government offices , sang their anthem , Bande Mataram. * They hung out Congress flags . They closed their shops . Leaders who were still unjailed tried to control the violence . They failed . <P> In Orissa Province furious mobs stormed police stations . At Eram 25 were killed . In Old Delhi gunfire dispersed 2,000 demonstrators . In Bombay , scene of earlier gas attacks ( see cut ) , lathee charges left blood-covered cobblestones in front of a statue of Queen Victoria . Some Indians in the hinterlands used bows and arrows . Guerrilla gangs attacked railways . <P> Conservative Congress members tried to convince younger party members that Gandhi 's nonviolent noncooperation was not an outmoded weapon . But with the Mahatma in jail on what may be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little evidence that violence was any more under control than when Gandhi and other Congress leaders were jailed two months ago . <P> Jarred by outside criticism , the British in India repeated their charges that Gandhi was a screwball pacifist at best , a traitor at worst . They claimed that , having governed India for 168 years , they were better prepared to meet India 's present crisis than well-meaning intruders . They asked how , with a Japanese invasion threatened , immediate Indian independence could be granted when the Indians could not agree among themselves ? This was a valid point , but twistable . <P> Mohamed Ali Jinnah , Moslem League president , played the British against the Hindu-dominated Congress party to gain power for himself and his vague plan of a separate Moslem state . The British pointed to Jinnah 's intransigence as an example of clashing Hindu-Moslem aspirations . It gave point to the British claim that Indian nationalists must unite before independence ( preferably dominionhood within the Empire ) will be granted . But efforts to promote a national wartime government were balked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jailed Gandhi . <P> Thoroughly disgusted , Allah Bakhsh , Moslem Premier of Sind Province and president of the All-India Azad ( independent ) Moslem Conference , returned to the government his Order of the British Empire and gave up his British title , Khan ( prince ) Bahadur . He announced that he was starting a movement of his own , to " fight British imperialism from within and foreign aggression from without . " <P> In India Allah Bakhsh 's stand carried weight . In London it and a flood of other protestations over the mishandling of the Indian crisis apparently carried none . The House of Commons debated a new India Bill ( to bypass court appeals in cases of military executions ) . When Leopold Amery , Secretary of State for India , announced that British planes were being used to machine-gun mobs in Bihar Province ( TIME , Oct. 5 ) , Tory backbenchers burst into cheers . <P> *Hail to the Motherland : " I bow to thee , Mother , rich with rivers , rich with fruits , with cool breezes , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bow to thee .
