50 her head , and the food revived her , but there was still a quiveringin her bowels that did n't seem to have anything to do with the walking , fretting , and quarreling she had done all morning . She felt gloomy indeed , and when she heard a resounding slap , a few inches from her ear , she barely turned her head . The girl who had served her was facing another girl , and even as Mildred looked , proceeded to deal out a second loud slap . " I caught you , you dirty little crook ! I caught you red-handed , right in the act ! " " Girls ! Girls ! " " I caught her ! She 's been doing it right along , stealing tips off my tables ! She stole ten cents off eighteen , before that lady sat down , and now she stole Iii teen out of a forty-cent tip right here  --  and I seen /w r do ii ! " In a moment the place was like a beehive , with other girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the manager flying out of the kitchen . Ile was a rotund little Greek , with flashing black eyes , and he summarily fired both girls and apologized profusely to the customers . When the two of them sullenly paraded out , in their street clothes , a few minutes later , Mildred was so lost in her reflections that she did n't even give her girl a nod . It was not until the hostess appeared in an apron , and began serving orders , that she woke up to the fact that she was face to face with one of the major decisions of her life . They needed help , that was plain , and needed it now . She stared at the water glass , twisted her mouth into a final , irrevocabledecision . She would not do this kind of work , if she starved first . She put a dime on the table . She got up . She went to the cashier 's desk , and paid her check . Then , as though walking to the electric chair , she turned around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mildred , were a waking nightmare . She did n't get the job quite as easily as she had supposed she would . The proprietor , whose name was apparently Makadoulis , but whom everybody addressed as Mr. Chris , was willing enough , especially as the hostess kept shrilling in his ear : " You 've got to put somebody on ! It 's a mess out there ! It 's a mess ! " But when the girls saw Mildred , and divined what she was there for , they gathered around , and passionately vetoed her application , unless Anna was taken back . Anna , she gathered , was the girl who had waited on her , and the aggressor in the fight , but as all of them apparently had been victims of the thefts , they seemed to regard her as their representative in a sense , and did n't propose to have her made a goat . They argued their case in quite noisy fashion , letting the counters pile up with orders while they screamed , and making appropriate gestures . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwich on it . Mildredcaught it as it fell . The sandwich was wholly wrecked , but she put it together again , with deft fingers , and restored it to its place on the counter . The Chef , a gigantic man addressed as Archie , watched her exhibition of juggling with impassive stolidity , but when the reconstructed sandwich was back on the counter he gave her a curt nod . Then he began banging on the steam table with the palm of his hand . This restored quiet as nothing else had been able to do . Mr. Chris turned to the girls . " Hokay , hokay . " The question of Anna being thus settled , the hostess hustled Mildred back to the lockers , where she unlocked a door and held out a menu . " Take off your dress and while I 'm finding a uniform to fit , study this menu , so you can be some use . What size do you wear ? " " Ten . " " You worked in a restaurant before ? " " No . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mildred took off her dress , hung it in the locker , and stared at the menu . There were fifty-five- and sixty-five-cent lunches on it , as well as appetizers , steaks , chops , desserts , and fountain drinks , most of these bearing fancy names that were unintelligible to her . In spite of her best concentration most of it was a jumble . In a minute or two the hostess was back with her uniform , a pale blue affair , with white collar , cuffs , and pockets . She slipped into it . " And here 's your apron . You furnish your uniform ; it comes off your first check , three ninety-five ; you get it at cost , and you keep it laundered . And if you do n't suit us , we charge you twenty-five cents ' rent on the uniform ; that comes out of your check too , but you clout have the whole uniform to pay for unlesswe really take you on . The pay is twenty-five cents an hour , and you keep your own tips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ida . What 's yours ?  --  " Mildred . " They started for the dining room , but going through the kitchen Ida kept talking into her ear . " I 'm giving you a light station , see ? Three , four , five , and six , all them little booths against the wall . That 's so you do n't get no fours . Singles and twos are easier . All them that 's just come in , you take them , and them that 's already started on their lunches , I 'll take care of them myself . That 's so you do n't get mixed up on them other girls ' books . " They reached the dining room , and Ida pointed out the station . Three of the tables were occupied by people who had given their orders before the fight started , the fourth by a pair of women who had just come in . All were getting annoyed at the delay in service . But still Mildred was n't permitted to start . Ida led her to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the complaints she had received , and of the five people who had already walked out . Ida cut her off , had her issue Mildred a new book . " You 've got to account for every check , see ? In here you mark your number , you 're No. 9 . Here you mark the number of the table , here the number of customers on the check . Down here , put down everything they order , and the first thing you got to learn : do n't make no mistake on a check . It 's all booked against you , and if you make a mistake , it 's deducted , and you got to pay for it . " With this ominous warning in her ears , Mildred at last approachedthe two women who were waiting to have their orders taken , handed them their menus , and inquired what they werep53going to have . They replied they were n't sure they were going to have anything , and wanted to know what kind of place this was anyway , to let people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mildred , almost in hysteria by now with what she had been through that day , felt a hot impulse to take them down a few notches , as she had taken Mrs. Forrester . However , she managed a smile , said there had been a little trouble , and that if they could just be patient a minute or two , she would see they were served at once . Then , taking a quick lunge at the only thing she remembered about the menu , she added : " The roast chicken is awfully good today . " Slightly mollified , they chose chicken on the sixty-five-cent lunch , but one of them said loudly : " See there 's no gravy on mine in any way , shape , or form . I hate brown gravy . " " Yes , Miss . I 'll remember . " Mildred started for the kitchen , barely missing a girl who appeared at the out door . Swerving in time , she dived through the in door and called to Archie : " Two roast chicken . One without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow , calling frantically to Archie : " Hold one gravy , hold it ! " Then she yanked Mildred aside , and half screamed at her : " You got to call it right ! You ca n't work nowhere without you 're in good with the Chef , and you got to call it right for him . Get this : If there 's any trimmings they do n't want , you do n't call it without ' em , you call it hold ' em ! " " Yes , Miss . " " You got to be in good with the Chef ! " Dimly Mildred began to understand why that great paw , banging on the steam table , had restored order when Mr. Chris had been mobbed like a Junebug in a flock of angry hens . She had observed that the waitresses dipped their own soup , so she now got bowls and filled them with the cream of tomato that her customers had ordered . But there was no surcease from Ida . " Pick up your starters ! Pick up your starters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two plates of salad from the sandwich counter , whipped two pats of butter onto two small plates , and motioned Mildred to get the four plates in there , quick . " Have they got water ? " " Not yet . " " For crying out loud . " Ida made a dive for the lift spigot , drew two glasses of water , p 54 slid them expertly so they fetched up beside the four plates . Then she pitched two napkins up against the water glasses . " Get in there with them  --  if they have n't walked out on you . " Mildred blinked helplessly at this formidable array . " Well  --  can I have a fray ? " In despair , Ida picked up plates , glasses , and napkins , so they were spread across her fingers like playing cards , and balanced halfway up her arm . " Get the soup , and come on . " She was , gone before Mildred could recover from the speed of her legerdemain . The soup Mildred picked up gingerly , kicking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking care not to spill any of it , she eventually reached the table . Ida was smoothing the two women down , and from their glances Mildred knew it had been fully explained to them that she was a new girl , and that allowanceshad to be made for her . At once they began amusing themselvesby calling her January and Slewfoot . Lest she show resentment , she started for the kitchen , but it seemed impossible to get away from Ida . " Pick up something ! Do n't never make a trip , in or out , without something in your hand . You 'll trot all day and you 'll never get done ! Get them dirty dishes over there , on No. 3 . Pick up something ! " The afternoon dragged on . Mildred felt stupid , heavy , slow , and clumsy : Try as she would to " pick up something , " dirty dishes piled on her tables , and unserved orders in the kitchen , until she thought she would go insane from the confusion . Her trouble , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry more than two dishes at a time . Trays were prohibited here , Ida informed her , because the aisles were so narrow they would lead to crashes , and this meant that everything had to be carried by hand . But the trick of balancing half a dozen dishes at a time was beyond her . She tried it once , but her hand crumpled under the weight , and a hot fudge sundae almost went on the floor . The climax came around three o'clock . The place was empty by then and the fish-faced cashier came back to inform her she had lost a check . The subsequent figuring showed that the check was for fifty-five cents , which meant that her whole hourly wage was lost . She wanted to throw everything in the place at the cashier 's head , but did n't . She said she was sorry , gathered up the last of her dirty dishes , and went back with them . In the kitchen , Mr. Chris and Ida were in a huddle , evidently talking about her . From their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verdict was unfavorable , and she waitedp 55 miserably for them to get it over with , so she could get away from Ida , and the Filipino dish washers , and the smell , and the noise , and drearily wonder what she was going to do next . But as they passed Archie , he looked up and made a gesture such as an umpire makes in calling a man safe at the plate . They looked surprised , but that seemed to settle it . Mr. Chris said " hokay , hokay , " and went into the dining room . Ida came over to Mildred . " Well personally , Mildred , I do n't think you 're suited to the work at all , and Mr. Chris , he was n't a bit impressed either , but the Chef thinks you 'll do , so against our better judgment we 're going to give you a trial . " Mildred remembered the reconstructed club sandwich and the little nod she had received from Archie , realized that it was indeedimportant to be in good with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intense , and she made no effort to keep the acid out of her voice as she said : " Well please thank Archie for me and tell him I hope ' I wo n't disappoint him . " She spoke loud enough for Archie to hear , and was rewarded with a loud , ursine cackle . Ida went on : " Your hours are from eleven in the morning , ten thirty if you want breakfast , to three in the afternoon , and if you want lunch then , you can have it . We do n't do a big dinner businesshere , so we only keep three girls on at night , but they take turns . You 're on call twice a week from five to nine , same wages as in the daytime . Sundays we 're closed . You 'll need white shoes . Ask for nurses ' regulation at any of the stores , two ninety-five . Well what 's the matter , Mildred , do n't you want the job ? " " I 'm a little tired , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you trot . " When she got home , the children had just arrived from school . She gave them milk and cookies and shooed them out to play . Then she changed her dress and put slippers on her aching feet . She was about to lie down , when she heard a yoo-hoo , and Mrs. Gessler joined her , in a somewhat dark humor . Ike , it appeared , had n't come home last night . He had phoned around nine , telling her of a hurry call that would prevent his arrival until next morning . It was all in his line of work , he had appeared at ten as he said he would , and yet . . . . The extent to which Mrs. Gessler trusted Ike , or anybody , was evidently very slight . Mildred presently asked : " Lucy , can you lend me three dol-lars ? "  | " More if you want it . " " No , thanks . I 've taken a job , and need some things . " " Right away ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mildred went back to the kitchen to make her some tea . When she came back she sat down gratefullyto the smoking cup , and flipped Mildred a bill . " I did n't have three , but here 's five . " " Thanks . I 'll pay it back . " " What kind of a job ? " " Oh  --  just a job . " " I 'm sorry . . . . But if it 's that kind of a job , I hope you picked a five-dollar house . You 're too young for the two-dollar trade , and personally I would n't like sailors . " " I 'm a waitress . In a hash-house . " " It rhymes up the same way . " " Just about . " " That 's funny , though . It was none of my business , but all the time you were answering those ads , and trying to get hired on as a saleswoman , or whatever it was  --  I kept wondering to myself why you did n't try something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose you did get a job as a saleswoman ? What would you get for it ? No matter how they figure it up , when you 're selling goods you get paid on commission , because it stands to reason if you were n't making commission they would n't pay you . But who 's buying any goods ? You 'd have just stood around some store , all day long , waiting for the chance to make a living , and not making it . People eat , though , even now . You 'll have somethingcoming in . And then , I do n't know . It may sound funny , but at selling , I 'd say you just were n't the type . At this , though  --  " All that Mrs. Boole had said , all that Miss Turner had said , all that her bowels had told her , after that trip to Beverly Hills , came sweeping over Mildred , and suddenly she dived for the bathroom . The milk , the sandwich , the tea , all came up , while moaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding her head , wiping her mouth , giving her water , leading her gently to bed . Here she collapsed in a paroxysm of hysteria , sobbing , shaking , writhing . Mrs. Gessler took her clothes off , massaged her back , patted her , told her to let it come , not to try to hold back . She relaxed , and cried until tears gushed down her face , and let Mrs. Gessler wipe them away as they came . Afterp 57 a long time she was quiet , but it was a glum , hopeless quiet . Then : " I ca n't do it , Lucy ! I  --  just  --  ca n't  --  do  --  it . " " Baby ! Do what ? " " Wear a uniform . And take their tips . And face those awful people . They called me names . And one of them grabbed my leg . Ooh  --  I can feel it yet . He put his hand clear up to  --  " " What do they pay you ? " " Twenty-five cents an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " " Baby , you 're nuts . Those tips will bring in a couple of dollars a day , and you 'll be making  --  why , at least twenty dollars a week , more money than you 've seen since Pierce Homes blew up . You 've got to do it , for your own sake . Nobody pays any attention to that uniform stuff any more . I bet you look cute in one . And besides , people have to do what they can do  --  " " Lucy , stop ! I 'll go mad ! I 'll  --  " At Mrs. Gessler 's look , Mildred pulled herself together , at least tried to make intelligible her violent outburst . " That 's what they 've been telling me , the employment people , everybody , that all I 'm good for is putting on a uniform and waiting on other people . and  --  " " And maybe they 're right , just at the present moment . Because maybe what they 're trying to tell you is exactly what I 'm trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all right to be proud , and I love you for it . But you 're starving to death , baby . Do n't you suppose my heart 's been heavy for you ? Do n't you know I 'd have sent roast beef in here , or ham , or whatever I had , every night , except that I knew you 'd hate me for it ? You 've just got to take this job  --  " " I know it . I ca n't , and yet I 've got to . " " Then if you 've got to , you 've got to , so quit bawling . " " Promise me one thing , Lucy . " " Anything . " " Do n't tell anybody . " " I would n't even tell Ike . " " I do n't care about Ike , or any of these people , what they think . It 's on account of the children , and I do n't want anybody at all to know it , for fear somebody 'll say something to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veda . " " That Veda , if you ask me , has some funny ideas . " " I respect her ideas . " p 58 " I do n't . " " You do n't understand her . She has something in her that I thought I had , and now I find I have n't . Pride , or whatever it is . Nothing on earth could make Veda do what I 'm going to do . " " That pride , I would n't give a snap of my finger for it . You 're quite right about her . Veda would n't do it herself , but she 's perfectly willing to let you do it and eat the cake . " " I want her to have it . Cake  --  not just bread . " During the six weeks Mildred had been looking for work , she had seen quite a little of Wally . He had dropped around one night , after the children had gone to bed , and was quite apologeticabout what he had said , and penitently asserted he had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard feelings , and brought him into the den , though she did n't bother to light a fire or serve a drink . But when he sat down beside her and put his arm around her , she got up and made one of her little speeches . She said she would be glad to see him any time , she wanted him as a friend . However , it must be distinctly understood that what was past was past , not to be brought up again under any circumstances . If he wanted to see her on that basis , she would try to make him welcome , and she really wanted him to come . He said gee that was swell of her , and if she really meant it , it was okeydokeby him . Thereafter he dropped by rather often , arriving usually around nine , for she did n't want the children to know quite how much she was seeing him . Once , when they were spending a weekend at the Pierces ' , he came on Saturday evening and " took her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for she was afraid the print dress would n't pass muster anywhere else , so they took a drive and ate in a roadside inn near Ventura . But one night , when her affairs were beginning to get desperate , he happened to sit beside her on the sofa again , and she did n't move . When he put his arm around her , in a casual , friendly kind of way , she did n't resist , and when he pulled her head on his shoulder she let it stay there . They sat a long time without speaking . So , with the door tightly locked , the shades pulled down , and the keyhole stuffed up , they resumed their romance , there in the den . Romance , perhaps , was n't quite the word , for of that emotion she felt not the slightest flicker . Whatever it was , it afforded two hours of relief , of forgetfulness . This evening , she found herself hoping that Wally might come ,  |p59so  she would n't have to think about the uniform she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence she would begin serving . But when the bell rang she was a little surprised , for it was only a few minutes after seven . She went to the door , and instead of Wally standing there , it was Bert . " Oh . Why  --  hello , stranger . " " Mildred , how are you ? " " Ca n't Complain . How 's yourself ? " " O.K. Just thought I 'd drop around for a little visit , and maybe pick up a couple of things I left in the desk , while I 'm about it . " " Well come in . " But suddenly there were such whoops from the back of the house that any further discussion of his business had to be postponedindefinitely . Both children came running , and were swept into his arms , and solemnly measured , to determine how much they had grown since he saw them . His verdict was " at least two inches , maybe three . " As Mildred suspected he had seen them both the previous weekend , this seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to be a secret , she did n't care to unmask it , and so acquiesced in three inches , and it became official . She brought them all back to the den , and Bert took a seat on the sofa , and both children snuggled up beside him . Mildred told him the main news about them : how they had got good report cards from school , how Veda was doing splendidly with her piano practice , how Ray had a new tooth . It was forthwithexhibited , and as it was a molar , required a deal of cheekstretchingbefore it came clearly into view . But Bert admired it profusely , and found a penny to contribute , in commemoration thereof . Both children showed him their new possessions : dolls , brought by Mrs. Gessler from San Pedro a few days before ; the gold crowns they were to wear at the pageant that would mark the closing of school in two weeks ; some balls , translucent dice , and perfume bottles they had obtained in trades with other children . Then Bert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly fashion . But as this took the spotlight off the children , they quickly became bored . After a spell of ballbouncing , which Mildred stopped , and a spell of recitations from the school pageant , which wound up in a quarrel over textual accuracy , Ray began a stubborn campaign to show Daddy the new sand bucket her grandfather had given her . As the bucket was in the garage , and Mildred did n't feel like going out there , Ray began to pout . Then Veda , with an air of saving a difficultp 60 situation , said : " Are n't you terribly thirsty , Father ? Mother , would you like me to open the Scotch ? " Mildred was as furious as she ever permitted herself to get at Veda . It was the same old Scotch , and she had been saving it against that dreadful day when she might have to sell it , to buy bread . That Veda even knew it existed , much less how to open it , she had no idea . And if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sit there , and sit there , until every drop of it was gone , and there went her Scotch , and there went her evening . At Veda 's remark , Ray forgot about the sand bucket , and began to shriek : " Yes , Daddy , we 're going to have a drink , we 're going to get drunk ! " When Bert said , " I might be able to stand a drink , if coaxed , " Mildred knew the Scotch was doomed . She went to the bedroom , got it out of the closet , went to the kitchen , and opened it . She turned out ice cubes , set glasses on a tray , found the lone seltzer siphon that had been there since winter . When she was nearly done , Veda appeared . " Can I help you , Mother ? " " Who asked you to go snooping around my closet to find out whether there was any liquor there or not ? " " I did n't know there was any secret about it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But , Mother , it 's Father . " " Do n't stand there and look me in the eye and pretend you do n't know what I 'm talking about . You know you had no businesssaying what you did , and you knew it at the time , I could tell by the cheeky look on your face . " " Very well , Mother . It shall be as you say . " " And stop that silly way of talking . " " But I remind you , just the same , that there was none of this kind of stinginess when Father was doing the in siting . Things have indeed changed here , and not for the better , alas . One might think peasants had taken over the house . " " Do you know what a peasant is ? " " A peasant is a  --  very ill-bred person . " " Sometimes , Veda , I wonder if you have good sense . " Veda stalked out , and Mildred grimly arranged the tray , wondering why Veda could put her so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having a drink was a gay ritual in the household , one that had started when Bert made his bathtub gin , and that proceeded on its prescribed course tonight . First he poured two stiff drinks for the children , cluck-clucking loudly at what rummies they were getting to be , and observing that he did n't know what the younger generation was coming to anyway . Then he poured two light drinks for himself and Mildred , containing perhaps two drops of liquor apiece . Then he put in ice and fizz water , set the drinks on the tray and offered them around . But by a fascinating switcheroo , which Mildred never quite understood , he always contrived to give the children the light drinks , himself and Mildredthe others . So adroit was this sleight-of-hand , that the children , in spite of their sharpest watching and concentrating , never got the drinks that were supposedly prepared for them . In the day when all the drinks were exactly the same color , there was always a delightful doubt about it : Bert said the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a whiff of juniper in all the glasses , they usually decided to agree . Tonight , although the switcheroo went off as smoothly as ever , the color of the Scotch betrayed him . But on his plea of fatigue , and the need of a stimulant , they agreed to accept the light drinks , so he set one of the stiff ones for Mildred , and took the other himself . It was a ritual , but after the prcliminaries were out of the way , it was enjoyed by each child differently . To Veda , it was an opportunity to stick out her little finger , to quaff elegantly , to play Constance Bennett . She regarded it as an occasion for high-toned conversation , and plied her father with lofty questions about " conditions . " He replied seriously , and at some length , for he regarded such inquiries as signs of high mentality on Veda 's part . He said that while things had been mighty bad for some time , he now saw definite signs of improvement , and believed " we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ray , it was a chance to " get drunk , " as she called it , and this she did with the utmost enthusiasm . As soon as she got half of her fizz water down , she jumped up and began spinning around in the middle of the floor , laughing at the top of her lungs . Mildred caught her glass when this started , and held it for her , and she spun around until she was dizzy and fell down , in a paroxysm of delight . Something always caught in Mildred 's throat when this wild dance began . She felt , in some vague way , that she ought to stop it , but the child was so delightful that she never could make herself do it . So now she watched , with the tears starting out of her eyes , for the moment forgetting the 62 Scotch . But Veda , no longer the center of the stage , said : " Personally , I think it 's a disgusting exhibition . " Ray now went into the next phase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taught her , and went as follows : I went to the animals ' fair , The birds and the beasts were there , The old baboonBy the light of the moon Was combing his auburn hair ; The monkey he got drunk , And fell on the elephant 's trunk , The elephant sneezedAnd fell on his kneesAnd what became of the monkety-monk ? However , as Ray recited it , there were certain changes . " Beasts " was a little beyond her , so the line became " the birds and the bees . " " Auburn " was a little difficult too , so the old baboon acquired a coat of " old brown hair . " The " monkety-monk " was such a tempting mouthful that he became the " **35;7092;TOOLONG , " a truly fabulous beast . While she was reciting , her father contrived to slip off his belt and stuff the buckle down the back of his neck , so that suddenly , when he pulled the free end over his head and began trumpeting on all fours , he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began circling around , coming nearer and nearer with her recitation . When she was almost on him , and had tweaked his trunk two or three times , he gave a series of mighty sneezes , so that they completely prostrated him . When he opened his eyes Bay was nowhere to be seen . IIe now went into a perfect dither of anxiety over what had happened to her , put his head in the fireplace and called loudly up the chimney : " Monkety , monkety , monk . " " Have you looked in the closet ? " " Mildred , I bet that 's just where she is . " He opened the closet , put his head in , and called : " Hey . " Mildred suggested the hallway , and he looked out there . Indeed , he looked everywhere , becoming more alarmed every minute . Presently , in a dreadful tone , he said : " Mildred , you do n't suppose that monk was completely atomized , do you ? " " I 've heard of things like that happening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veda picked up her glass , stuck out her little finger , took a fastidious sip . " Well , Father , I do n't really see why you should get so upset about it . It seems to me anybody could see she 's right behind the sofa . " " For that , you can go to bed . " Mildred 's eyes blazed as she spoke , and Veda got up very quickly . But Bert paid no attention . He draped the belt over his head again , got down on his hands and knees , said " woof-woof , " and charged around the sofa with the cut-out open . He grabbed the ecstatically squealing Ray in his arms , said it was time they both went to bed , and how would they like Daddy to tuck them in ? As he raised the child high in the air , Mildred had to turn her head , for it seemed to her that she loved Bert more than she could love any man , so that her heart was a great stifling pain . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belt on his trousers again , and poured himself another drink , she was thinking sullenly about the car . It did n't occur to her that he was the half-dozenth person she had been furious at that day , and that all of them , in one way or another , were but the faces worn by her own desperate situation . She was a little too literal-minded for such analysis : to her it was a simple matter of justice . She was working , he was n't . He was n't entitled to something that would make things so much easier for her , and that he could get along well enough without . He asked her again how she had been , and she said just fine , but all the time her choler was gaining pressure , and she knew that before long it would have to come out . The bell rang , and she answered . But when Wally gave her a friendly pat on the bottom she quickly whispered : " Bert 's here . " His face froze for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincingness . In a voice that would be heard all over the house , he bellowed : " Why , Mildred ! Say I have n't seen you in a coon 's age ! Gee you 're looking great ! Say , is Bert in ? " " He 's right in here . " " I 'll only be a minute , but I got to see him . " If Wally elected to believe Bert still lived here , Bert evidently preferred to follow suit . He shook hands with a fine show of hospitality , offered a drink as though the liquor were his own , and asked how was every little thing quite as though nothing had happened . Wally said he had been trying to see him for a couple of months now , over something that had come up , and so help him God , this was the first chance he had had . Bert said do n't tell him , he simply did n't know what made the time fly . Wally said it was those three houses in Block 14 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise been made at the time of the sale that the corporation would put a retaining wall in the rear ? Bert said absolutely not , and launched into details as to how the lots were sold . Wally said it had all sounded pretty funny to him , but he wanted to make sure . Mildred half listened , no longer in any humor for Wally , her mind on the car , and thinking only how she would begin . But then a perfectly hellish idea entered her mind , and she no sooner thought of it than she acted on it . " My but it 's hot in here ! Are n't you boys uncomfortable in those coats ? Do n't you want to take them off ? " " I think she said something , hey , Bert ? " " I 'll say she slid . " " Do n't get up . I 'll take them . " They took off their coats , and she draped them over her arm , and stepped into the closet to put them on hangers . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers into Bert 's change pocket , and there , as she knew it would be , was the key to the car . She took it out , slipped it into her shoe . When she came out of the closet she picked up her drink , which she had barely touched . " I think I 'll get tight . " " ' Atta girl ! " " Lemme freshen it for you . " Bert put fresh ice in her glass , and a little more liquor , and a squirt of seltzer , and she took two or three quick swallows . She tinkled her ice , told the story of Harry Engel and the anchors , which amused the two gentlemen greatly . When she finished , she felt the key tickling her instep , and let out the first ripple of real laughter that had come out of her in months . She had a charminglaugh , a little like Ray 's , and it startled the two men , too , so for a time they laughed with her , as though there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a sour feeling over who got the job with the receiver . But Wally , evidently a little nervous , and more than a little uncertain about his status , decided presently that he had to leave . Bert took him ceremoniously to the door , but he discovered that he had forgotten his coat , and this gave him a chance to dash back for a quick word with Mildred . " Hey , is he back ? I mean , is he living here ? " " Just saying hello . " " Then I 'll be seeing you . " " I certainly hope so . " When Bert came back he resumed his seat , took a meditative sip out of his glass , and said : " Looked like he had n't heard anything . About us , I mean . I figured there was no need to tell him . " " You did exactly right . " " What he do n't know wo n't hurt him . " " Certainly not . " The bottle was getting low now , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had come for . " Before I go , Mildred , remind me to get a couple things out the desk . Nothing important , but might as well take them along . " " Can I find them for you ? " " My insurance policy . " His voice was a little ugly , as though he expected an argument . The policy was for $1,000 , paid-up value $256 , and he had never taken out more because he did n't believe in insurance as an investment , preferring A. T. &; T. There had been wrangles about it , Mildred insisting that if anything happened to him " it 's the one thing between the children and the poorhouse . " Yet she knew it was the next item for sacrifice , and obviously he was bracing himself for opposition . But she blandly got it for him , and he said " Thanks , Mildred . " Then , apparently relieved at the easy way he got it , he said : " Well , goddam it , how you been , anyway ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . " They had the last two in the bottle , and then he said he had to go . Mildred got him his coat , and took him to the door , and submitted to a teary kiss , and he went . Quickly she turned out the lights , went to the bedroom , and waited . Sure enough , in a few minutes the bell rang . She opened , and he was standing there , looking a little foolish . " Sorry to bother you , Mildred , but my car key must have fallen out of my pocket . You mind my looking ? " " Why , not at all . " He went back to the den , snapped on the light , and looked al's over the floor where he had been playing with Ray . She watched him with pleased , slightly boozy interest . Presently she said : " Well come to think of it , perhaps I took that key . " " You took it ? " " Yes . " " Well gim me it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood smiling as the dreadful truth dawned on him , and his face sagged numbly . Then she stepped quickly aside as he pawed at her . " I 'm not going to give it to you , and there 's no use in your trying to take it from me , because I 've got it in a place where I do n't think you 'll find it . From now on , that car 's mine . I 'm working , and I need it , and you 're not , and you do n't need it . And if you think I 'm going to pound around on my feet , and ride busses , and lose all that time , and be a sap , while you lay up with another woman and do n't even use the car , you 're mistaken , that 's all . " " You say you 're working ? " " Yes , I am . " " Then O.I . Why did n't you say so sooner ? " " Would you like me to ride you back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You staying with Maggie ? " " Prefer not to say where I 'm staying . I 'm staying where I 'm staying . But if you drop me by Maggie 's , it 's all right . Got to see her for a minute , so you can drop me there  --  if it 's convenient for you . " " Anywhere 's convenient for me . " They went out together , and got in the car . Fishing the key out of her shoe they started off , and rode silently to Mrs. Biederhof 's , where she said she was awfully glad he dropped around , and wanted h , im to feel welcome any time , not only for the children'ssake but for her sake . IIe solemnly thanked her , said he had enjoyed the evening , and opened the door to get out . Then he grabbed for the key . However , she had foreseen exactly that contingency , and palmed the key as soon as she turned on the ignition . She laughed , quite gaily malicious , " Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " " Good night , Bert . And I have a couple of old brassieres at the house , tell her . They 're clean and fresh and she can have them any time she drops around . " " Listen , goddam it , you got the car . Now kindly shut up . "  | " Anything you say . " She pulled away and drove home . When she got there the light was still on , and everything was as she had left it . Glancing at the gas , she saw there were two gallons in the tank , and kept on straight ahead . At Colorado Avenue she turned . It was the first through boulevard she had been on , and the traffic signals were off , with yellow blinkers showing . She gave the car the gun , excitedly watching the needle swing past 30 , 40 , and 50 . At 60 , on a slight upgrade , she detected the gravelly sound of ping , made a mental note to have the carbon removed . Then she eased off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremulous sigh . The car was pumping something into her veins , something of pride , of arrogance , of regained self-respect , that no talk , no liquor , no love , could possibly give . Once more she felt like herself , and began thinking about the job with cool detachment , instead of shame . Its problems , from balancing the dishes to picking up starters , flitted through her mind one after another , and she almostlaughed that a few hours ago they had seemed formidable , When she put the car in the garage , she inspected the tires with a flashlight , to see how they looked . She was pleased to find that there was considerable rubber left , so that new ones would n't be needed at once . Then she ran humming into the house , turned out the light , and undressed , in the dark . Then she went to the children 's room , put her arms around Veda , and kissed her . As Veda stirred sleepily , she said : " Something very nice happened tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I take everything back that I said . Now go to sleep and do n't think about it any more . " " I 'm so glad , mother . " " Goodnight . " " Goodnight . "  |p68WITHIN  A FEW DAYS , Mildred 's financial troubles had eased a little , for she quickly became the best waitress in the place , not only at giving service , but at bagging tips . The trick of balancingdishes she learned by practicing after the children had gone to bed . She used tin plates , weighting them with stones from the garden , and got so that she could spread three on the fingers of her left Land , lay two more on her arm , remember not to stick her tongue out , and go sailing around the kitchen table without dropping any . Tips , she knew instinctively , were a matter of regular customerswho left dimes instead of nickels . She cultivated men , as all the girls did , as they were better tippers than women . She thought up little schemes to find out their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crotchets , and saw that Archie gave them exactly what they wanted . She had a talent for quiet flirtation , but found that this did n't pay . Serving a man food , apparently , was in itself an ancient intimacy ; going beyond it made him uncomfortable , and sounded a trivial note in what was essentially a solemn relationship . Simple friendliness , coupled with exact attention to his wants , seemed to please him most , and on that basis she had frequent invitations to take a ride , have dinner , or see a show . At first she did n't quite know what to do about them , but soon invented a refusal that was n't a rebuff . She would say she wanted him to " keep on liking her , " that he " might feel differently if he saw her when she was n't in uniform . " This had the effect of arousing a good lively fear that perhaps she was n't so hot in her street clothes , and at the same time of leaving enough pity for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could serve his lunch . Having her leg felt , it turned out , was practically a daily hazard , and this she found best not to notice . Even a leg feeler , if properly handled , could be nursed into a regular who left good tips , no doubt to prove he really had a heart of gold . She held aloof from the restaurant itself , and the people cur.  | nected with it . This was n't entirely due to her ideas of social superiority . In her own mind , she was highly critical of the kitchen , and was afraid to get drawn into talk , for fear she would say what she thought , and lose her job . So she confined her observationsto Mrs. Gessler , and every night gave a savage account of the way things were done . Her special grievance was the pies . They were bought from the Handy Baking Company , and Mrs. Gessler often laughed loudly at Mildred 's description of their uninvitingappearance , their sticky , tasteless filling , and their hard , indigestible crusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untilone day she heard Ida bawling out Mr. Chris . " I 'm that ashamed to put it on the table ! I 'm that ashamed to ask a customerto eat it ! It 's just awful , the pie you put out here , and expect people to pay for it . " Mr. Chris , who took all bawlingsoutwith a martyred shrug , merely said : " Maybe a pie is lousy , but what you expect , times like these now ? If he no eat , see me , I hokay a new cheek . " Mildred opened her mouth to take Ida 's side , and hotly proclaim that a new check would n't make the pie taste any better . But at that moment it flashed through her mind that perhaps the real remedy was to get the pie contract herself . With the chance to make these precious dollars , her whole attitudechanged . She knew she had to capture Ida , and not only Ida , but everybody else in the place . That afternoon she was rather more helpful to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at lunch , sat down with them and got sociable . Meanwhile , she reflected what she was going to do about Ida . She was working that evening , and after the place closed , noticed Ida hurrying out with a glance at the clock , as though she might be catching a bus . Holding the door open , she asked : " Which way do you go , Ida ? Maybe I could give you a lift . " " You got a car ? " " Anyway , it goes . " " Me , I live on Vermont . Up near Franklin . " " Why it 's right on my way . I live in Glendale . " The iciness was gone by the time they climbed in the car . As they parted , Mildred asked Ida if she 'd like her to stop by and pick her up , on the way over in the morning . From then on Ida had a ride , and Mildred had a better station , and more importantly , she had Ida 's ear , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They became bosom friends , and p 70 somehow the talk always got around to pies . Ida was bitter indeedat the product Mr. Chris offered his customers , and Mildred listened sympathetically . And then one night she innocently inquired : " What does he pay for those pies , Ida ? " " If he pays two bits , he 's being swindled . " " Yes , but how much . " " I do n't know . . . . Why ? " " I make pies . And if he pays anything at all , I 'd meet the price and make him some that people would really want to eat . I 'd make him some that would be a feature . " " Could you do it , honest ? " " I sell them all the time . " " Then I 'll find out what he pays . " From then on , pies became a feverish conspiracy between Mildred and Ida , and one Sunday Mildred drove over to Ida 's with a fine , wet , beautifully-made huckleberry pie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment , and Mildredsuspected that a pie might help with the Sunday night supper . Next day , during the luncheon rush , while Mr. Chris had stepped over to the bank to get more change , Ida stopped Mildredin the aisle , and said in a hoarse stage whisper : " He pays a straight thirty-five cents for them and takes three dozen a week . " " Thanks . " That night , Ida was full of the information she had filched from the file , and on Mildred 's calculation that she could furnish pies at thirty-five cents , she became masterful . " You leave it to me , Mildred . Just leave it to me . You wo n't have to say one word . I 've been knowing it all along I had to have a showdown about them pies , and now it 's coming . Just leave it all to me . " The showdown , next morning , was a little noisier than Mildred had expected . Mr. Chris said he had dealt with the Handy BakingCompany for years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been losing customers for years too , and did n't have sense enough to know it . And besides , Ida went on , here 's a girl that makes grand pies , and what was the matter , did n't he want customers ? Mr. Chris said not to bother him , he was busy . Ida said look at the variety she 's got , cherry , huckleberry , strawberry- . " No chilly , no hooklabilly , no strawbilly ! " Mr. Chris fairly shouted his emphasis . " All a pieces fall down in a juice , waste half a pie , no good ! Appliss , poomkin , limmon  --  no other kind ; wo n't have 'm . " At this Ida went into the dining room , beckoning Mildred afterp 71 her . When they were alone she whispered excitedly : " You heard what he said ? Apple , pumpkin , lemon  --  no other kind . That means he wants to switch , but he 's too bullheaded to say so . Now listen , Mildred . Tomorrow you bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemon . Just three , no more . And I 'll see that they 're served . They 're samples , but you 've got to remember one thing : It 's got to be his idea . " Ida put her head through the door and beckoned , and Anna came out . Anna , the girl with the sock , had been reinstated some time before . Ida pulled her into the huddle . " Listen , Anna , you heard what I said to him in there ? " " Ida , them pies are a disgrace , and  --  " " O.K. , then you do just like I say , and we 'll get Mildred 's piesin here , ' stead of them cow pies we got now . Anna , they 're just wonderful . But you know how he is , so tomorrow , when I put out the samples Mildred 's going to bring , you put the bee on him and say that 's what he 's been up to all along . Then he thought it up , and we break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Orphan Annie . " " And put it on thick . " " I 'll take that Greek like Grant took Richmond . Do n't worry , Mildred . We 'll sell your pies for you . " Mildred had a warm , wet-eyed feeling toward them both , and decided that Anna rated a free pie now and then , too . That afternoon she made the samples , and next morning Ida took charge of them herself , hurrying back to the kitchen with them like a spy carrying bombs . Changing into her uniform , Mildred was as nervous as an actress on opening night , and when she went into the kitchen there was expectancy in the air . Mr. Chris was at his desk , in the corner , and presently got up and went over to the out door . Here he posted , with a thumbtack , a piece of cardboardon which was written , in his Mediterranean handwriting , the special order for the day : SellHam &; S PotatoAll gathered around and looked at it . Ida went over to the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and added : &; PieOne by one , the girls filed in the dining room. p 72 Lunch had barely started when Mildred managed to sell two pieces of pie . Mr. Rand , one of her regular customers , came in early with another man , and when she handed him the menu to pick out his dessert , she asked innocently : " Would you care for a piece of pie , Mr. Rand ? The lemon is very good today . " Mr. Rand looked at his companion . " That just shows how much principle she 's got . The pie stinks , she knows it slinks , and yet she says the lemon is very good today . Lay off the pie  --  unless you 're really tired of this life , and prefer to be dead . " " We have a new line of pie today , Mr. Rand . " " Well  --  is it any good ? " " You try a piece . I think you 'll like it . " The other man chose chocolate ice cream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she came back with both desserts and the coffee , her heart gave a leap as she heard a customersay : " That pie looks good . " When she set it in front of Mr. Rand the other man did n't even let her put the ice cream down . " Say , I want some of that ! Can I switch ? " " Why certainly ! " " Principle ? She 's got principle plus . Say , that meringue looks two inches thick . " By noon , the lemon pie was a few smears of filling in an empty plate , and by one o'clock , all three pies were gone . By three , Ida had opened up on Mr. Chris , with everybody standing around , to watch the result . She said just look how them pies went . She said the lemon was gone before she could even turn around , and one customer wanted a second cut , and she did n't have it to give him . She said it was just terrible what the people said , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bakery pies . To all of this , Mr. Chris made no reply whatever , merely hunching over his desk , and acting as though he was ( leaf . Ida plowed on , louder and louder . She said there was one lady , in a party of four , that wanted to know where they got such wonderful pies , and when she pointed out Mildred , she was that amazed . Mr. Chris twisted uneasily , and said not to bother him , he was busy , and " So that 's what you was up to ! " He jumped up , and found Anna 's finger not six inches from his nose , leveled at him as though it were a six-shooter . Giving him no time to recover , she went on : " So that 's why you been asking all them questions about Mildred ! That 's why you been foxing around ! And who told you she made pies , I 'd like top 73 know ? Well can you beat that . Every time you take your eye off him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unflattering harangue Mr. Chris at first returned a blank stare . Then he burst into loud laughter , and pointed a derisive finger at Ida , as though it was a great joke on her . Ida professed to be highly indignant , that he should " let her go on like that " when he knew about Mildred 's pies all the time , and had already made up his mind to take them . The more she talked the louder he laughed , and then , after he had wiped his streamingeyes , the bargain was struck . There was a little difficulty about price , he trying to beat Mildred down to thirty cents , but she held out for thirty-five , and presently he agreed . That night Mildred stood treat to Ida and Anna in a speako Wally had taken her to , and helped Anna pick up a man at a nearby table . Still with her first half dozen pies to make , she drove home very late , full of a gulpy love for the whole human race . On the strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and began to drum up more trade with the neighborhood customers , on the theory that a few extra pies were no more trouble , but that the extra money would be so much velvet . For pies one at a time , she had charged , and still charged , eighty-five cents each . Shortly , as a result of the neighborhood trade , there dropped into her lap another restaurant contract . Mr. Harbaugh , husband of one of her customers , spoke of her pies one night at the Drop Inn , a cafeteria on Brand Boulevard , not far from Pierce Drive , and they called her up and agreed to take two dozen a week . So within a month of the time she went to work as a waitress , she was working harder than she knew she could work , and still hold out until Sunday , when she could sleep . Taking care of the children was out of the question , so she engageda girl named Letty , who cooked the children 's lunch and dinner , and helped with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pies . She bought two extra uniforms , so she could launder all three at once , over the weekend . This chore , however , she did in the bathroom , behind locked doors . She made no secret of the pies ; she could n't , very well . But she had no intention that either the children or Letty should know about the job . And yet , tired as she was most of the time , there was a new look in her eye , even a change in her vocabulary . Talking with Mrs. Gessler , she spoke of " my pies , " " my customers , " " my mar-p 74eting " ; the first personal pronouns predominated . Unquestionablyshe was becoming a little important , in her own eyes , at least , a little conceited , a little smug . Well , why not ? Two months before , she barely had pennies to buy bread . Now she was makingeight dollars a week from her Tip-Top pay , about fifteen dollars on tips , more than ten dollars clear profit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little sports suit , got a permanent . Only one thing bothered her . It was now late in June , and on July 1 seventy-five dollars was due on the mortgages . Her affluencewas recent , and she had saved less than fifty dollars toward what she needed , but she was determined not to worry . One night , driving with Wally , she said abruptly : " Wally , I want fifty dollars out of you . " " You mean  --  now ? " " Yes , now . But it 's to be a loan , and I 'll pay you back . I 'm making money now , and I can let you have it in a month , easy . But the interest is due on those mortgages Bert took out , and I 'm not going to be foreclosed out of my home for a measly fifty bucks . I want you to get it to me tomorrow . " " O.K. I think I got it . " " Tomorrow . " " Hell , I 'll write you a check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came home to find Letty in one of her uniforms . She had n't bought uniforms for Letty yet . She had her put an apron on , over the wash dresses she came to work in , and said the uniform question would be postponed until it was certain she was satisfactory . Now , seeing Letty in restaurantregalia , she felt her face prickle , but left the kitchen for fear of what she might say . But Letty caught the look and followed . " I told her you would n't like it , Mrs. Pierce . I told het right off , but she hollered and carried on so I put it on , just to keep her quiet . " " Who hollered and carried on ? " " Miss Veda , ma 'm . " " Miss Veda . " " She makes me call her that . " " And she told you to put that uniform on ? " " Yes 'm . " " Very well . It 's quite all right , if that 's how it happened , busp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remember I 'm giving orders around here , not Miss Veda . " " Yes 'm . " Mildred made her pies , and nothing more was said about it that afternoon , or at dinner , Veda taking no notice of Letty 's change of costume . But after dinner , when Letty had gone home , Mildred summoned both children to the den , and talking mainly to Veda , announced they were going into the question of the uniform . " Certainly , Mother . It 's quite becoming to her , do n't you think ? " " Never mind whether it 's becoming or not . The first thing I want to know is this : Those uniforms were on the top shelf of my closet , under a pile of sheets . Now how did you happen to find them there ? " " Mother , I needed a handkerchief , and went to see if any of mine had been put with your things by mistake . " " In the closet ? " " I had looked everywhere else , and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer , and they still are , and you were n't looking for any handkerchief at all . Once more you were snooping into my things to see what you could find , were n't you ? " " Mother , how can you insinuate such  --  " " Were n't you ? " " I was not , and I resent the question . " Veda looked Mildred in the eye with haughty , offended dignity . Mildred waited a moment , and then went on : " And how did you happen to give one of those uniforms to Letty ? " " I merely assumed , Mother , that you had forgotten to tell her to wear them . Evidently they had been bought for her . If she was going to take my things to the pool , I naturally wanted her decently dressed . " " To the pool ? What things ? " " My swimming things , Mother . " Little Ray laughed loudly , and Mildred stared bewildered . School being over , she had left a book of bus tickets , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Griffith Park . But that Letty was included in the excursion she had no idea . It quickly developed , however , that Veda 's notion of a swim in the pool was for herself and Ray to go parading to the bus stop , with Letty following two paces behind , all dressed up in uni-p 76 form , apron , and cap , and carrying the swimrning bags . She even produced the cap , which Mildred identified as the collar of one of her own dresses . It had been neatly sewed , so as to make a plausible white corona , embroidered mound the edges . " I never heard of such goings-on in my life . " " Well , Mother , it seems to me wholly proper . " " Does Letty go in swimming ? " " Certainly not . " " What does she do ? " " She sits by the pool and waits , as she should . " " For Miss Veda , I suppose ? " " She knows her place , I hope . " " Well hereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she goes with you to the pool , she goes in her own clothes , and she has a swim . If she has n't a suit , I 'll get her one . " " Mother , it shall be as you say . " Little Ray , who had been listening to all this with vast delight , now rolled on the floor , screaming with laughter , and kicking her heels in the air . " She ca n't swim ! She ca n't swim , and she 'll get drownded ! And Red will have to pull her out ! He 's the life guard , and he 's stuck on her ! " At this , Mildred began to understand Letty 's strange conduct , and had to laugh in spite of herself . Veda thereupon elected to regard the inquest as closed . " Really , Mother , it seems to me you made a great fuss over nothing . If you bought the uniforms for her , and certainly I ca n't imagine who else you could have bought them for  --  then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had slightly overdone it . In a flash , from the special innocence with which she could n't imagine who else the uniformscould have been bought for , Mildred divined that she knew the truth , and that meant the whole thing had to be dealt with fundamentally . For Veda 's purpose , in giving Letty the uniform , might be nothing more sinister than a desire to make a peafowl 's progress to the pool , but it might be considerably more devious . So Mildred did n't act at once . She sat looking at Veda , the squint hardening in her eye ; then she scooped up Ray in her arms , and announced it was time to go to bed . Undressing her , she played with her as she always did , blowing into the buttonholesof the little sleeping suit , rolling her into bed with a loud whoosh and a final blow down the back of her neck . But all the time she was thinking of Veda , who never took part in these frivolities . Out of the corner of her eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dressing table for a period of primping , whose main object seemed to be the spreading of as many combs , brushes , and bottles in front of her as the table would hold . She was none too agreeable about it when Mildred finished with Ray , and ordered her to the den for more talk . She got up angrily and threw down a brush . " Yee gods  --  what now ? " When they got to the den , Mildred closed the door , sat down in the armchair , and stood Veda in front of her . " Why did you give Letty that uniform ? " " For heaven 's sake , Mother , have n't I told you once ? How often do I have to tell you ? I wo n't have you questioning me this way . Good night  --  I 'm going to bed . " Mildred caught her arm , pulled her back . " You knew , when you gave it to Letty , that that was my uniform , did n't you ? " " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool , so calculated , so insolent , that Mildred waited longer than she usually did , when angered . Then she went on : " I 've taken a job as a waitress in a restaurant in Hollywood ? ' " As a  --  what ? " " As a waitress , as you very well know . " " Yee gods ! Yee  --  " Mildred clipped her on the cheek , but she gave a short laugh , and brazenly finished : "  --  gods and little fishes ! " At this , Mildred clipped her a terrific wallop on the other cheek , that toppled her to the floor . As she lay there , Mildred began to talk . " So you and your sister can eat , and have a place to sleep , and a few clothes on your backs . I 've taken the only kind of a job I could get , and if you think I 'm going to listen to a lot of silly nonsense from you about it , you 're mistaken . And if you think your nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're mistaken about that , too . How you found out what I was doing I do n't know  --  " " From the uniform , stupid . You think I 'm dumb ? " Mildred clipped her again , and went on : " You may not realize it , but everything you have costs money , from the maid that you Ordered to go traipsing with you to the pool , to your food , and everything else that you have . And as I do n't see anybody else doing anything about it  --  " Veda had got up now , her eyes hard , and cut in : " Are n't the pies bad enough ? Did you have to degrade us by  --  " Mildred caught her by both arms , threw her over one knee. p 78 whipped the kimono up with one motion , the pants down with another , and brought her bare hand down on Veda 's bottom with all the force her fury could give her . Veda screamed and bit her leg . Mildred pulled loose , then beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed as though demons were inside of her . Then Mildred let Veda slide to the floor , and sat there panting and fighting the nausea that was swelling in her stomach . Presently Veda got up , staggered to the sofa , and flung herselfdown in tragic despair . Then she gave a soft laugh , and whispered , in sorrow rather than anger : " A waitress . " Mildred now began to cry . She rarely struck Veda , telling Mrs. Gessler that " the child did n't need it , " and that she " did n't be . lieve in beating children for every little thing . " But this was n't the real reason . The few tunes she had tried beating , she had got exactly nowhere . She could n't break Veda , no matter how much she beat her . Veda got victory out of these struggles , she a trembling , ignoble defeat . It always came back to the same thing . She was afraid of Veda , of her snobbery , her contempt , her unbreakable spirit . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veda 's bland , phony toniness : a cold , cruel , coarse desire to torture her mother , to humiliate her , above everything else , to hurt her . Mildred yearned for warm affection from this child , such as Bert apparently commanded . But all she ever got was a stagy , affected counterfeit . This half loaf she had to accept , trying not to see it for what it really was . She wept , then sat with a dismal feeling creeping over her , for she was as far from settling the main point as she had ever been . Veda had to be made to accept this job she had taken , else her days would be dull misery , and in the end she would have to give it up . But how ? Presently , not conscious of having hatched any idea , she began to talk . " You never give me credit for any finer feelings , do you ? " " Oh Mother , please  --  let 's not talk about it any more . It 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll try not to think about it . " " As a matter of fact , I felt exactly about it as you do , and I certainly would never have taken this job if it had n't been that I  --  " Mildred swallowed , made a wild lunge at something , anything , and went on : "  --  that I had decided to open a place of myp79own , and I had to learn the business . I had to know all about it and  --  " At least Veda did sit up at this , and show some faint sign of interest . " What kind of a place , Mother ? You mean a  --  " " Restaurant , of course . " " Veda blinked , and for a dreadful moment Mildred felt that this did n't quite meet Veda 's social requirements either . Desperatelyshe went on : " There 's money in a restaurant , if it 's run right , and  --  " " You mean we 'll be rich ? " " Many people have got rich that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not be quite the toniest thing that Veda could imagine , riches spoke to the profoundestpart of her nature . She ran over , put her arms around her mother , kissed her , nuzzled her neck , insisted on being punished for the horrible way she had acted . When Mildred had given her a faltering pat on the bottom , she climbed into the chair , and babbled happily to Mildred about the limousine they would have , and the grand piano , on which she could practice her music . Mildred gladly promised all these things , but later , when Veda was in bed and she herself was undressing , she wondered how long she could keep up the pretense , and whether she could get another job before her bluff was called . And then a hot , electric idea flashed through her mind . Why not have her own restaurant ? She looked in the mirror , and saw a calculating , confident woman 's face squinting back at her . Well , why not ? Her breath began to come just a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook , she had such a gift for it as few ever have . She was learning the business ; in fact , so far as pies went , she was in business already . She was young , healthy , stronger than she looked . She had two children , all she wanted , all she could be expected to bring into the world , so there need be no more of that . She was implacably determined to get ahead , somehow . She put on her pajamas , turned out the light , but kept walking around the room , in the dark . In spite of herself , the limousine , the chauffeur , and the grand piano began to gleam before her eyes , but as real this time , not imaginary . She started for bed , then hurried to the children 's room . " Veda ? " " Yes , Mother . I 'm awake . " She went over , knelt down , put her arms around the child , p 80 hugged her passionately . " You were right , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , no matter what anybody says , never give up that pride , that way you have of looking at things . I wish I had it , and  --  never give it up ! " " I ca n't help it , Mother . It 's how I feel . " " Something else happened tonight . " " Tell me . " " Nothing to tell . Only now I feel it , now I know it , that from now on things are going to get better for us . So we 'll have what we want . Maybe we wo n't be rich , but  --  we 'll have something . And it 'll all be on account of you . Every good thing that happens is on account of you , if Mother only had sense enough to know it . " " Oh Mother , I love you . Truly I do . " " Say it again .... Say it  --  just once  --  more . "  |p81AGAIN  MILDRED 'S attitude toward the restaurant changed , from critical disapproval to eager curiosity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been in business many years , and it dawned on her now that his system was the ancient systemthat any restaurant must use , if it is to run at all . She began to study it hard , noting the bookkeeping , the marketing . the method of using up leftovers , particularly the tricks used by Archie , who did many things that annoyed her . but never used two motions where one would suffice , never wondered if a dish was done , but always knew , and at that moment picked it up . Some of his principles she adopted at once in making her pies , for she was addicted to a deal of peeping into the oven , and giving them one more minute , just to make sure . Now she put them in by the clock and took them out by the clock , and saved herself much fretting , and made better pies . All the time her confidence was growing , her ideas clarifying as to the kind of place she meant to have . But one thing vexed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money ? In the afternoons , if she had an hour , she drove to the restaurant supply houses on Main Street , in Los Angeles , and priced , calculated , and added up . As well as she could tell , she would need a thousand dollars ' worth of equipment before she could start , even in a small way . A range , icebox , steam table , and sink were going to cost at least half that , and furniture , dishes , silver , and linen would account for the rest . To save this money , at her present income , was going to take a long time , and there was always the risk that she would lose her job , or that some shift in the pie situation would wipe her out completely , and leave her exactly where she was in the spring . She had to get started , but on whose money she did n't know . She thought about Wally , and even about Mrs. Gessler , but she doubted if they were good for such a sum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a short time she flirted with the idea of getting it from p 82 Mr. Otis , a retired butcher turned federal meat inspector , who was a regular customer , and always left her a quarter . She worked on his romantic nature to the point where he suggested meeting her outside , and then realized she should have her notes and memoranda in some kind of order if she was to impress him enough to make a deal . So one night , when Wally had reached the stage of yawns and a cigarette , she turned on the light and sat down at the desk . " Wally , want to help me with something ? " " Not particularly . " " I have to have it soon . Tomorrow , maybe . " " What is it ? " " I do n't know what you 'd call it . An estimate of costs , something like that . For a moan that may back me in business . But I want it all written down , with the right words for what I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette ashes into the fireplace , turned around and blinked . " What kind of business ? " " Just a restaurant . " " Hey , wait a minute , wait a minute . " He squashed his cigarette and came over to her . Then he pulled up a chair and sat down . " Start all over again . And at the beginning . Not in the middle . " Haltingly , feeling suddenly self-conscious about it , she told him her plan : a small restaurant , where she would do the cooking herself , and sell nothing but chicken . " They have steak places . And fish places . And I thought  --  well , down where I work practically every other order is for chicken , so it looks to me as though I ought to have plenty of customers . And then I would n't have to fool with all those a la carte prices , or bookkeeping , or menus , or leftovers , or anything like that . Everybody gets a chicken-and-waffle dinner , or chicken and vegetables , if they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have pies to take out , and keep on getting all the wholesale pie business that I can , and  --  well , it looks like one would help the other . I mean , the pies would help the restaurant and the restaurant would help the pies . " " " And who is this guy ? " " Just an old fogy that eats lunch with me every day . But I think he 's got money . And if I could show him it was a good investment , he might let me have what I need . " Wally took several turns around the room , looking at her as he went . She was so accustomed to think of him as a fat blobp 83 that she occasionally forgot what a cold little eye he really had . Presently he asked : " You really think you can put that across ? " " Well  --  do n't you ? " " I 'm asking you . " " It seems as though it ought to pay . I 've worked it all out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of everything . I can certainly cook . And I 've studied tha business down there , every little thing I could think of . I mean , the system . And how to save money . That 's the main thing , Wally , about this idea of mine . What costs in a restaurant is waste , and the extras , like printing . for the menus , and the people you have to have , for every little feature you put in . But this way , there would n't be any waste . All the leftovers would go into gravy and soup , and there would n't be any printing , or extras of any kind . I certainly think I can put it across . " " Then if you can , I might be able to pat you in on a deal . One that would start you off with a bang . A deal that would leave you sitting so pretty you would n't even need a backer . " " Wally ! If you do n't look out , I 'll cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what I 'm going to say to you . You know that model home we had ? That dream house that Bert built , so we could take the prospects in there and show them what their place was going to look like if they spent twice as much dough as any of them had ? " " Yes , of course . " She had special , rather romantic reasons for remembering the model home . " O.K. They got to get rid of it . " " Who ? " " The receivers . For Pierce Homes , Inc . The outfit that pays me to be their attorney , and messenger boy , and thief , and anything else they can think of . They 've got to get rid of it , and if you 'll take it over and put this chicken place in it , it 's yours . And believe me , Mildred , if that 's not a natural for a restaurant , I never saw one . Why , that place even smells like chicken . Right there under the trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dough on  --  is that a place to gnaw wishbone ! Dump a little gravel on one side  --  free parking for everybody that comes in . That big reception room  --  perfect for the restaurant part . The model Pierce bedroom  --  there 's your pantry . The streamlined Pierce office  --  there 's your kitchen . Every stick in the place complieswith the fire law and the health law , even to the toilets , and there 's two of them , not just one . If you really mean this , I canp 84 get it for you for four thousand bucks , house , lot , and every improvement that 's on it . " " Wally , now I am going to cry . " " Was I asking if you had four thousand bucks ? I know what you 've got and what you have n't got , and I 'm telling you , if you want it , it 's yours . " He leaned down close , looked melodramatically around , as though to make sure nobody could hear . Then , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses . " " Who ? " " The receivers ! On their federal income tax , the return due next March , for the year 1931 , they 've got to show losses . If they do n't , they 're sunk . That 's why it 's yours , for four thousand bucks . " " Wally , I 'd still have to have money ! " " Who says you would ? That 's the beauty of it . Once you take title to a piece of property around this town , that 's all they want to know  --  you can get all the credit you want , more than you can use . You think those supply houses are n't feeling this Depression too ? They ca n't give the stuff away , and all they ask is : Do you own property , or not ? They 'll deliver anything you want , and connect it up for you , too . You need a little cash , two , three hundreddollars , maybe , I can take care of that . All you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , quick . " For the first time in her life , Mildred felt the quick , hot excitement of a conspiratorial deal . She comprehended the credit aspect of it , once Wally explained it , and she did n't need to be told how perfect the place was for her purposes . In her mind 's eye she could already see the neon sign , a neat blue one , without red or green in it : MILDRED PIERCEChicken Waffles PiesFree ParkingBut it all seemed too good to be true , and when she asked eager questions about it , Wally explained : " There 's no catch to it . They 're in one hell of a hole . On those other properties , even if they did get rid of one , the federal rulings leave them worse off than they were before . I mean , when we did n't build the houses , even if we had to recapture when the buyer defaulted , there 's no way we can show losses . But on this , there 's the twenty-five hundred the corporation paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auditor can question . And there 's the eleven thousand five hundred that Bert spent on the house , and the corporation 's money , not his . Fourteen grand all together , and if we let you have it for four , there 's a loss of ten thousand dollars that just about takes care of every little thing for 1931 , and then some . " " But why me ? " " Why not ? Who else wants it ? Nobody can live in that dump , you know . All Bert was building was a real-estate office , but for some reason nobody seems to want a real-estate office right now . It 's got to be somebody that can use it for something else , and that means you . " " I know , but before I get too excited about it , you 'd better make sure . Because if they 're just giving it away , it looks as though there 'd be somebody , on the inside  --  " " Oh  --  I see what you mean . As a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . I put my foot down . They were original incorporators , and I 've dealt with the government enough to know that if some fast stuff like that was pulled , we 'd all land in jail . On a thing like this , it 's got to be bona fide , and that 's where you come in . If the government agent do n't like it , he can go up and see your place , and eat the chicken , and satisfy himselfyou 're using it for the purposes you said you were going to use it for . And then he can take a look at our files and see that we took the best offer we could get . It 'll be on the up-and-up . You 're no insider . You 're no original incorporator . You 're  --  " He broke off , sat down , and began cursing , first softly , then with rising vehemence . Sensing something wrong , she asked : " What is it , Wally ? " " Bert . " " What 's he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well ? " " He 's an original incorporator , and you 're married to him , and there goes your restaurant , and the prettiest deal I 've had a chance to put across since Pierce Homes folded . " It was ten minutes before Mildred could get through her head the ramifications of community property , and the fact that Bert , by merely being married to her , would be co-owner of the restaurant , and therefore subject to a ruling . Then she argued about it , indignantly and passionately , but she could see by Wally 's face that the point was serious . He left presently , saying hep 86 would talk to his colleagues and look up the law , and she went to bed frantic lest this , her first big chance , would be lost on a legal technicality . She had a recurrence of her bitter fury against Bert , and the way he seemed to thwart her at every turn . Next night Wally was back , looking more cheerful . " Well , it 's O.K. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is that the only way ? " " Well ? Bert left you , did n't he ? " " I wish there was some other way . " " Why ? " ? " Because I do n't know how Bert 's going to act about it . You never can count on Bert . If it was just his heart , that would be all right : But he 's got some twist in his head , and you never know what he 's going to do . He might make trouble . " " How ? " " He 'd think of some way . " There 's no way . If he 'll let you get a divorce on the ground of cruelty , do it nice and quiet , all well and good . If he gets tough , you spring that Biederhof woman on him , and he 's got to give way , because on infidelity he ca n't block it . You do n't ask him . You tell him . " " It takes a year , does n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if it 's no use , why do it ? " " It takes a year before your decree becomes final . But as soon as it 's entered , that ends the community property , and that 's all you 've got to worry about . " " Well  --  I ' 11 see him . " " Cut out that well ' stuff . Look , Mildred , you might as well get this thing cleaned up . Because even if it was n't for this federal thing , you 'd hardly dare go into business , still married to Bert . You do n't know where he gets his money . For all you can tell , you 'd no sooner hang out a sign than you 'd have more judgments and attachments and garnishees slapped on you than you could count . You 'd be broke before you started . But , soon as you shake Bert , you 're all right . " " I said I 'd see him . " " If it 's money that 's worrying you , forget it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of it 's nothing . But get going . The deal 's hot , and you have n't got one day to lose . " Next Sunday , when the children were invited to dinner by the 87 Pierces , Mildred knew Bert was coming over . She had sent word to him that she wanted to see him , and this obviously was an arrangement that would insure his finding her alone . She started her pies early , in the hope she would be done before he got there , but she was up to her elbows in dough when he walked in the kitchen door . He asked how she had been , and she said just fine , and she asked how he had been , and he said he could n't complain . Then he sat down quite sociably and watched her work . It was some time before she could bring herself to broach the subject , and when she did broach it , she did so after considerablebeating around the bush . She told about the model home , and the legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult . Then , gulping a little , she said : " So , it looks as though we 've got to get a divorce , Bert . " He received this statement with a very grave face , and waited a long time before he spoke . Then he said : " That 's something I 'll have to think about . " " Have you any particular objections ? " .. I 've got plenty of objections . For one thing , I belong to a church that 's got some pretty strict rules on this matter . " " Oh . " She could n't keep the acid out of her voice as she spoke . That he should bring up his perfunctory connection with the Episcopalchurch struck her as pretty far-fetched , particularly as her understanding was that what his church objected to was n't divorce itself , but remarriage of divorced persons . But before she could make the point , he went on : " And I 'd have to know more about this deal of Wally Burgan 's . A whole lot more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You 're my wife , are n't you ? " She turned away quickly , thrust her hands into the dough , tried to remember that arguing with Bert was like arguing with a child . Presently she heard him saying : " I probably know ten times as much about federal taxes as Wally Burgan does , and all I can say is it sounds to me like a lot of hooey . It comes down to a straight question of collusion : Is there any , or is n't there ? In all cases involving collusion , the burden of proof is on the government , and in this case there ca n't be any proof , because I can testify , any time they call me , that there was n't any . " " Bert , do n't you see that it is n't a question of proving anything to a court , one way or another ? It 's whether they let me have the property or they do n't . And if I do n't get a divorce , they won't. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way at all . " " And what am I going to tell Wally ? " " Just refer him to me . " " Bert patted his thighs , stood up , and seemed to regard the discussionas closed . She worked furiously at the dough , tried to keep quiet , then wheeled on him . " Bert , I want a divorce . " " Mildred , I heard all you said . " " What 's more , I 'm going to get one . " " Not unless I say the word . " " How about Maggie Biederhof ? " " And how about Wally Burgan ? " In his palmiest days as a picture extra , Bert never did such a take 'm as he did at that moment , with the dough doing service as a pie . It caught him square in the face , hung there a moment , then parted to reveal tragic , injured dignity . But by the time it had cascaded in big blobs to the floor , dignity had given way to hot anger , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew what was going on . He said she ought to know by now she could n't pull the wool over his eyes . Then he had to go to the sink to wash his face , and while he clawed the dough away , she talked . She taunted him with not making a living for his family , with standing in her way every time she tried to make the living . He tried to get back to the subject of Wally , and she shrilled him down . He said O.K. , but just let her try to bring Maggie Biederhofinto it , and see what happened to her . He 'd fix it so she 'd never get a divorce , not in this state she would n't . As she screamed once more that she would have a divorce , she did n't care what he did , he said they 'd see about that , and left . Mrs. Gessler listened , sipped her tea , shook her head . " It 's the funniest thing , baby . Here you lived with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve years , and still you do n't understand him , do you ? " " He 's got that contrary streak in him . " " No he has n't . Once you understand Bert , he 's not contrary at all . Bert 's like Veda . Unless he can do things in a grand way , he 's not living , that 's all . " " What 's grand about the way he acted ? " " Look at it , for once , the way he looks at it . He does n't care about the church , or the law , or Wally . He just put all that in to sound big . What 's griping him is that he ca n't do anything for the kids . If he has to stand up in court and admit he ca n't pay one cent for them , he 'd rather die . " " Is he doing anything for them now ? " " Oh , but now is just a trifling detail , a temporary condition that he does n't count . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be never . " " Will you just let me talk for a while ? It 's his fear of being a fiat tire , I 'm telling you , at one of those big dramatic moments of any man 's life , that 's making him dog it . But he ca n't hold out very long . For one thing , there 's the Biederhof . She wo n't like it when she finds out you asked for a divorce and he would n't give it to you . She 's going to wonder if he really loves her  --  though how anybody could love her is beyond me . And all the time , he 's got it staring him in the face that the harder he makes it for you the harder he 's making it for the kids . And Bert , he loves those kids , too . Baby , Bert 's on the end of the plank , and there 's nowhere for him to jump but off . " " Yes , but when ? " " When he gets the pie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to send him . It 's going to be a very special pie . It does n't appeal to his stomach , except incidentally . It appeals to his higher nature , and in Bert , that means his vanity . It 's a pie you 've been fooling around with , and you want his opinion on its commercial possibilities . " " I do n't really mind making Bert a pie . " " Then get at it . " So Mildred made him a pie , a deep-dish creation , filled with crabapples cunningly candied with sugar so as to bring out the tart of the apples as well as the crystal sweetness of the sugar . It was about as commercial as a hand-whittled clothespin , but she wrote a little note , asking his opinion , and a little P.S. , saying she had put his initials on it to see if she could still do monograms . She sent it by Letty , and sure enough , around the middle of the week , there came another invitation to the children , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pies out of the way early , and to make a cold lunch . It was Letty 's Sunday on , and Mildred had her serve the lunch in the den , preceding it with a cocktail . These attentions Bert accepted gravely , and discussedthe pie at length , saying he thought it would be a knockout . There was a great field , he said , in ready pastries , since people no longer kept the servants they used to , and were often stumped for a company dessert . All this was what Mildred had been thinking for some time , but that did n't occur to her particularly , and she was genuinely happy to hear such hopeful opinion . Then Bert said it all over again , and then a pause fell betwen them . Then he said : " Well Mildred , I told you I 'd think that little matter over , and I have . " " Well ? " " Of course any way you look at it , it 's unpleasant . " " It certainly is for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two people hate to think about . But we really got nothing to do with it . " " I do n't know what you mean , Bert . " " I mean , whether it 's unpleasant for us , that 's not it . It 's what 's best for those kids that counts , and that 's what we got to think about . And talk about . " " Did I ever have any other reason ? It 's for them that I want to take advantage of this opportunity . If I can make a go of it , I can give them what I want them to have , and what you ought to want them to have , too . " " I want to do my share . " " Nobody 's asking you to do anything . I know that when you 're able , you 'll be only too glad to do anything you can . But now  --  did I say one word about it ? Did I ? " " Mildred , there 's one thing I can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do it . I can see that you have a place to sleep , and that the kids have , and that nobody can take it away from you . I want to give you the house . " Mildred , caught wholly by surprise , wanted to laugh and wanted to cry . The house had long ceased to be a possession , so far as she was concerned . It was a place that she lived in , and that crushed her beneath interest , taxes , and upkeep . That Bert , with a straight face , should offer it to her at this time struck her as merely grotesque . And yet she remembered what Mrs. Gessler had said , and knew she was in the presence of a man and his pride . She got up suddenly , went over , and put her arms around him . " You do n't have to do that . " " Mildred , I want to . " " If you want to , there 's only one thing I can do , and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want ' you to know that . " " All right , but you 've got to take it . " " I 'm sorry I said what I did about Mrs. Biederhof. " p 91 " I 've been hating myself for what I said about Wally . Christ , I know there 'd never be anything between you and that fat slob . But  --  " " We keep saying things . " " That 's it . That we do n't mean . " " That we could n't mean , Bert . Do n't you think I hate this just as much as you do ? But it 's got to be . For their sake . " " Yeah , for their sake . " They talked low and close for a long time , and then got to laughing over the way he looked when she hit him with the dough . Then they got to laughing over the charges she would have to bring , and the cruelties he had been guilty of . " I guess you 'll have to hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , , and caused her great mental and physical anguish . " " You talk like Veda . She 's always wanting to be hit . " " I 'm glad there 's a little of me in her . " He doubled his fist , brushed her chin with it . Then they both burst into shaking , uncontrollable sobs . " The gams , the gams ! Your face ai n't news ! " It was a moment before Mildred quite knew what was meant , but then she gave her skirt a little hitch , and was n't exactly displeasedwhen a photographer whistled . Mrs. Gessler , having no gams to speak of , stood . behind her , and the bulbs went off . Next thing she knew , she was in court , raising her hand , swearing to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help her God , and giving her name , address , and occupation , which she described as " housewife . " Then she was answering questions put to her by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sympathetic , red-haired man who gently urged her to tell an elderly judge the story of Bert 's unendurablecruelties : his silences , during which he would n't speak to her for days on end ; his absences from home , his striking her , " in an argument over money . " Then she was sitting beside Wally , and Mrs. Gessler was up there , corroborating everything she said , with just the right shade of repressed indignation . When Mrs. Gessler got to the blow , and Wally asked her sternly if she had actually seen it , she closed her eyes and whispered , " I did . " Then Mildred and Mrs. Gessler were out in the corridor where Wally presently joined them . " O.K. Decree 's entered . " " My  --  so soon ? " " That 's how it goes when you got a properly prepared ease.  |p92No  trouble about a divorce if it 's handled right . The law says cruelty , and that 's what you got to prove , but that 's all you got to prove . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument . " He drove them home , and Mildred made drinks , and Bert came in , to sign papers . She was glad , somehow , that since the , real-estate deal started , Wally had been curiously silent about romance . It permitted her to sit beside Bert without any sense of deceit , and really feel friendly toward him . The first chance she got , she whispered in his ear : " I told them the property settlementhad been reached out of court . The reporters , I mean . Was that all right ? " " Perfectly . " That this elegant announcement should come out in the papers , she knew , meant a great deal to him . She patted his hand , and he patted back . Wally left , and then Bert , after a wistfullook at his glass , decided he had to go too . But something caught in Mildred 's throat as he went down the walk , his hat at what was intended to be a jaunty angle , his shoulders thrown bravely back . Mrs. Gessler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I do n't know . I feel as though I 'd picked his bones . First his kids , and then his car , and now the house , and  --  everything he 's got . " " Will you kindly tell me what good the house would do him ? On the first call for interest he 'd lose it , would n't he ? " " But he looked so pitiful . " " Baby , they all do . That 's what gets us. "  |p93T  WAS A hot morning in October , her last at the restaurant . The previous two weeks had been a mad scramble in which it had seemed she would never find time for all she had to do . There had been visits to Los Angeles Street , to order the equipmenther precious credit entitled her to ; calls on restaurant proprietors , to get her pie orders to the point where they would really help on expenses ; endless scurrying to the model home , where painters were transforming it ; hard , secret figuring about money ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost too exhausted to sleep . But now that was over . The equipment was in , particularly a gigantic range that made her heart thump when she looked at it ; the painters were done , almost ; three new pie contracts were safely past the sample stage . The load of debt she would have to carry , the interest , taxes , and installments involved , frightened her , and at the same time excited her . If she could ever struggle through the first year or two , she told herself , then she would " have something . " So she sat with the girls at breakfast , listening to Ida instruct Shirley , who was to take her place , with a queer , light feeling , as though she were made of gas , and would float away . Ida talked with her customary earnestness . " Now when you got to make a customer wait , you ca n't just leave him sit there , like you done with that old party yesterday . You got to take an interest in him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like you could ask him if he would n't like a bowl of soup or something , while he 's waiting . " " At leas ' ask him do n't he want to feel your leg . " Ida took no notice of Anna 's interruption , but went grimly on . When a customer came in and sat down at Anna 's station , Mildredmotioned Anna back to her coffee . " Sit down . I 'll take care of him . " " She paid little attention to the customer , except to wonder whether his bald spot was brown by nature , or from sunburn . It was a tiny bald spot , with black hair all around it , but it was ap 94 bald spot just the same . While he fingered the menu , she decidedfor sunburn . Then she noticed he was heavily sunburned all over , but even this did n't account for a slightly Latin look about him . He was quite tall , and rather lanky , and a bit boyish looking in his battered flannels . But his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continental . All these things , though , she noted without interest until he put down the menu and glanced at her . " What in the hell am I looking at that for ? Why does anybody ever look at a menu for breakfast ? You know exactly what you 're going to have , and yet you keep looking at it . " " To find out the prices , of course . " She had no intention of making a gag , but his eyes were friendly , and it slipped out on her . He snapped his fingers as though this were the answer to something that had worried him all his life , and said : " That 's it . " Then they both laughed , and he got down to business . " O.K.  --  you ready ? " " Shoot . " " Orange juice , oatmeal , bacon and eggs , fried on one side and not too much , dry toast , and large coffee . You got it ? " She recited it back to him , with his own intonations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could step on it slightly , show just a little speed  --  why , I might get to Arrowhead in time for a little swimming before the sun goes down . " " Gee , I wish I could go to Arrowhead . " " Come on . " " You better look out , I might say yes . " When she came back with his orange juice , he grinned and said : " Well ? I meant it . " " I told you to look out . Maybe I did too . " " You know what would be a highly original thing for you to do ? " " What 's that ? " " Say yes , right away  --  like that . " A wild , excited feeling swept over her . It suddenly occurred to her that for the moment she was free as a bird . Her pies were all made and delivered , the children were with the Pierces at the beach , the painters would be done by noon , there was nothing to detain her at all . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in God 's big index , and as she turned away from him she could feel the wind in her hair . She went to the kitchen , and beckoned to Ida . " Ida , I think the real trouble with that girlp 95 is me . I think I make her nervous . And she 's got to start some time . Why do n't I just quietly get out ? " Ida looked over toward Mr. Chris , who was doing his morning accounts . " Well he 'd just love to save a buck . " " Of course he would . " " All right , Mildred , you run along , and I wish you all kinds of luck with your little restaurant , and I 'll be out the very first chance I get , and  --  oh , your check ! " " I 'll pick it up next week . " " That 's right , when you come with the pies . " Mildred got the bacon and eggs , went out with them . His eyes met hers before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repress a little smile as she approached . As she set down the plate she asked : " Well , what are you grinning about ? " " And what are you grinning about ? " " Oh  --  might as well be original once in a while . " " Damn it , I like you . " The rest of it was quick , breathless , and eager . He wanted to get started , she insisted she had to take her car home . He wanted to tail her there , she said she had an errand to do after she got there . The errand was to see that the model home was locked after the painters got out , but she did n't go into that . They made the rendezvous at the Colorado Pharmacy , at twelve fifteen . Then Anna approached , to take over and collect her tip . Mildred hurried to her locker , changed , said her hasty good-byes , and scooted . She did n't , however , go home at once . She raced over to the Broadway Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had money enough with her to pay for them . Then she raced to her car and started home . It was fourteen minutes to twelve , by the dash clock , when she whirled up the drive . She put the car away , closed the garage , and ran into the house with her bundles , glancing from habit toward the Gesslers ' , but the shades were all down , they apparently having gone away for the weekend . Inside , she pulled her own shades down , locked all doors , checked icebox , range , water heater , and spigots . Then she whipped off her dress , changed into the little sports suit and floppy hat . She ripped open the new beach bag , stuffed her purchases into it . From her dressing table she took a comb , dropped that in . From the bathroom she got a clean towel and cake of soap , dropped them in . Then she closed the bag , gotp 96 out a light coat , and dived out the door . Then , trying it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive , but at a pace in comic contrast with the haste of a moment before . For the benefit of all who might be looking , she proceeded at demure leisure , merely a lady out for a Saturday swim , the beach bag dangling innocently from her hand , the coat thrown carelessly over one arm . But when she got out of the block her pace quickened . She was almost running when she reached the model home . It was properly locked , and a glance through the windows told her the painters had gone . She tiptoed around it , her eyes shooting into every precious part . Then , satisfied that everything was in order , she started for the drugstore . She had gone only a block or two when she heard a horn , so close it made her jump . He was within a few feet of her , at the wheel of a big blue Cord . " I honked you before , but I could n't make you stop . " " Anyway , we 're both on time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Going through Pasadena they decided it was time to tell names , and when he heard hers , he asked if she was related to Pierce Homes . When she said she was " married to them for a while , " he professed to be delighted , saying they were the worst homes ever built , as all the roofs leaked . She said that was nothing to how the treasury leaked , and they both laughed gaily . His name , Beragon , he had to spell for her before she got it straight , and as he put the accent on the last syllable she asked : " Is it French ? " " Spanish , or supposed to be . My great-great-grandfather was one of the original settlers  --  you know , the gay caballeros that gypped the Indians out of their land , the king out of his taxes , and then sold out to the Americans when Polk started annexing . But if you ask me , the old coot was really a wop . I ca n't prove it , but I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanished it up , it 's all right with me . Wop or spig , I would n't trust either one as far as a snail can hop , so it does n't make much difference , one way or the other . " " And what 's your ' first name ? " " Montgomery , believe it or not . But Monty 's not so bad . " " Then , if I ever get to know you well enough to call you by your first name , I 'll call you that . " " Is that a promise , Mrs. Pierce ? " p 97 " It is , Mr. Beragon . " She was pleased at all these particulars about himself , for they told her he was giving her his real name , and not a phony inventedfor a somewhat irregular occasion . She settled back , lost a slightly uneasy feeling she had had , of being just a pick-up . From Glendale to Lake Arrowhead , for any law-abiding citizen , is a trip of two hours and a half . But Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blue car climbed into the seventies and stayed there , and when they pulled up at the gate of the settlement it was only a little after two . They did n't enter it , however . They took the little road to the right , and in a momentwere stealing through great mountain pines that ladened the air with their smell . Presently they nosed down a rough dirt track , twisted through bushes that whacked the windshield , and pulled up with a jerk behind a little shingled shack . Mr. Beragon set his brake , started to get out , and then said , as though he had just thought of it : " Or would you prefer a bathhouse , around on the other side ? I keep this shack here , but  --  " " I think this is fine . " He took her bag , and they went clumping around a boardwalk to the front . He unlocked the door , and they stepped into the hottest , stuffiest room that Mildred had ever been in . " Wooh ! " He strode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening doors , letting air circulate in a place that evidently had n't been opened for a month . While he was doing this she looked around . It was the living room of a rough mountain shack , with a rough board floor through whose chinks she could see the red earth beneath . Two or three Mexican rugs were scattered around , and the furniture was oak , with leather seats . However , there was a stone fireplace , and a horsy , masculine look to everything , so she half liked it . He reappeared presently , and said : " Well , are you hungry ? We can get lunch at the tavern , or would you rather swim first ? " " Hungry ? You just had breakfast ! " " Then we 'll swim . " He picked up her bag and led the way to a small back room whose only furnishings were a cotton rug , a chair , and an iron bed , made up neatly with blankets . " If you can manage here , i 'll use the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I wo n't be long . "  | Both of them spoke with elaborate casualness , but she was no sooner alone than she pitched the bag on the bed and zipped it open even more quickly than she had zipped it shut . She was terrified he would reappear before she had finished dressing . Yet the possible consequences , as such , were n't what frightened her . The heat , and now the piny breeze that was blowing in , filled her with a heavy , languorous , South Seas feeling that wanted to dawdle , to play , to get caught half dressed , without any shame whatever . But as he left her , she had caught a whiff of her hair , and it reeked of Archie 's bacon grease . It often did , she knew , specially when she was a day or so late at the beauty shop , but as to whether Wally noticed this , or liked it , or did n't like it , she cared no more than she cared whether he dropped by or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice it was a possibility that made her squirm . She had an obsession to get overboard , to get washed , before he came near her . She slipped feverishly out of her clothes , put them on a chair , slipped on the suit . This was before the day of sarongs , and it was a simple maroon affair that made her look small , soft , and absurdly childish . She put on the rubber slippers , picked up the soap . Near her was a door that seemed to lead to some sort of small corridor . She opened it and peeped . Out back was a lattice , and beyond that the walk that circled the house . She pattered out and around , then ran straight down to the little jetty , with its small float . Clutching the soap in her hand , she dived off . The water was so cold she flinched , but she swam down until she was within a few inches of the stones she could see on bottom . Now safely out of sight , she ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free hand , holding her breath until her heart began to pound . When she came up he was standing there , on the float , so she let the soap flutter to the bottom . " You were certainly in one hell of a hurry . " " I was hot . " " You forgot your cap . " " I  --  ? I must be a sight . " " You look like a drowned rat . " " If you could only see what you look like ! " At this pert remark he dived in , and there ensued an immemorialchase , with the immemorial squeals , kicks , and splashes , She retreated out of his reach , he followed with slow , lazy strokes ; sometimes they stopped and floated , then resumed , as hep 99 thought of some new stratagem to catch her . After a while she tired , and began circling to get back to the float . Then he was in front of her , having swum under water to cut her off . Then she was caught , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the shack . As she felt its warmth again , the dopey South Seas feeling returned . She felt limp and helpless , and barely had strength to kick the beach bag off the bed . It was dark when they got up , and they drove over to the tavern for dinner . When they got back it was cold , and they decided to build a fire , of pine knots . But then they decided they had n't had enough to eat , and got in the car , and drove down to San Bernardino , for a steak , which she offered to broil . When they got back it was late , but they gathered pine knots by the car lights , and carried them in , and started them going . When they were glowing red she laid the steak on them , to burn it , and then held it with the tongs while it cooked . Then he got plates , and they cut hungrily into it , chewing it down like a pair of wolves . Then he helped her wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go home , and she solemnly replied that she was . Then he carried her into the bedroom , and they shivered at tile unexpected cold , and in five minutes were exclaimingat how good the blankets felt . After a while they got to talking , and she learned that he was thirty-three years old , that he had attended the University of California at Los Angeles , that he lived in Pasadena , that his family lived there too , or at any rate his mother and sister , who seemed to be all the family he had . When she asked him what he did , he said : " Oh I do n't know . Fruit I guess . Oranges , grapefruit , something like that . " " You mean you work for the Exchange ? " " I should say not . That damned California Fruit Growers ' Exchangeis taking the bread right out of my mouth . I hate Sunkist , and Sunmaid , and every other kind of a label with that wholesome-looking girl on it . " " You mean you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference does it make what I am ? Yes , I guess I 'm an independent . I have a company . Fruit export . I do n't have it . I own part of it . Land too , part of an estate I came into . Every quarter they send me a check , and it 's been getting smaller since this Sunkist thing cut it , too . I do n't do anything , if that 's what you mean . " p 100 " You mean you just  --  loaf ? " " You can call it that , I suppose . " " Are n't you ever going to do something ? " " Why should I ? " He seemed quite nettled , and she stopped talking about it , but she found it disturbing . She had a complex on the subject of loafing , and hated it , but she detected there was something about this man 's loafing that was different from Bert 's loafing . Bert at least had plans , grandiose dreams that he thought would come true . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of life , and it had the same effect on her that Veda 's nonsense had : her mind rejected it , and yet her heart , somehow , was impressed by it ; it made her feel small , mean , and vulgar . The offhand dismissal of the subject put her on the defensive too . Most of the men she knew were quite gabby about their work , and took the mandate of accomplishment seriously . Their talk might be tiresome , but it was what she accepted and believed in . This bland assumption that the whole subject was a bore , not worth discussing , was beyondher ken . However , her uneasiness vanished with a little eartwiddling . At daybreak she felt cold , and pushed her bottom against him . When he took her in his arms she wriggled into his belly quite possessively , and dropped off to sleep with a sigh of deep content . Next day they ate and swam and snoozed , and when Mildred opened her eyes after one of these naps , she could hardly believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still they dawdled , he arguing they should stay another day , and make a weekend of it . The Monday pies , however , were on her mind , and she knew she had to get at them . It was six o'clock when they drove over to the tavern for an early dinner , and seven before they got started . But the big blue Cord went down even faster than it had come up , and it was barely nine as they approached Glendale . He asked where she lived , and she told him , but then she got to thinking . " Want to see something , Monty ? " " What is it ? " " I 'll show you . " He kept following Colorado Boulevard , and then at her direction he turned , and presently stopped . " You wait here . I wo n't be a minute . " She got out her key and ran to the door , her feet crunching on the gravel . twat had been dumped for the free parking . Inside ,  | she groped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign . Then she ran out to observe its effect . He was already under it , peering , blinking . It was , indeed , a handsome work of art , made exactly as she had pictured it , except that it had a blazing red arrow through its middle . Monty looked first at the sign , then at Mildred . " Well what the hell ? Is this yours ? " " Do n't you see whose name is on it ? " " Wait a minute . The last I heard , you were slinging hash in that  --  " " But not any more . Yesterday was my last day . I quit early to run off with you . From now on , I 'm a business woman . " " Why did n't you tell me ? " " I did n't get any chance , that I noticed . " At this tribute to his prowess as a lover , he grinned , and she pulled him inside , to see the rest of it . She switched on the lights and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the new maple tables , pointing out the smart linoleum floor covering , explaining it was required by the Department of Health . She took him to the kitchen , opened up the great range . He kept asking questions , and she poured out the whole story , excitedly flattered that a professional loafer could be interested . Yet it was an amended version . There was little in it of Wally , or Bert , or any of the circumstances that had actually figured in it , a great deal about her ambitions , her determination " to be something before I die . " Presently he asked when she was going to open . " Thursday . The cook 's night out . I mean everybody 's cook . " " Next Thursday ? " " At six o'clock . " " Am I invited ? " " Of course you are . " She switched off the lights , and for a moment they were standing there in the dark , with the smell of paint all about them . Then she caught him in her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've fallen for you . " " Why did n't you tell me about all this ? " " I do n't know . I was going to , but I was afraid you might just think it was funny . " " I 'll be here Thursday . With bells . " " Please . It wo n't be the same without you . " He took her home , handed her to the door , made sure she had her key . As she was waving good-bye to the disappearing Cord she heard her name called . Automatically she looked toward the 102 Gesslers ' , but their house was still dark . Then she saw a woman coming across lawns , and saw it was Mrs. Floyd , who lived two doors away . " Mrs. Pierce ? " There was a sharp note in the voice , and Mildred had a quick prescience that something was wrong . Then , in a tone of virtuousindignation that the whole street could hear , Mrs. Floyd cut loose . " Where in the world have you been ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and  --  where have you been ? " Mildred choked back an impulse to tell her it was none of her business where she had been , managed to inquire civilly : " What did they want with me , Mrs. Floyd ? " " It 's your daughter . " . " My  --  " " Your daughter Ray . She 's got the flu , and they 've taken her to a hospital , and  --  " " Which hospital ? " " I do n't know which hospital , but  --  " Mildred dashed into the house and back to the den , snapping on lights as she went . As she picked up the phone a horrible feeling came over her that God had had her number , after all.  | AS MOM MADE her dozenth remark about Mildred 's disappearanceover the weekend , Mildred 's temper flared . It had been , indeed , a trying hour . She had rung a dozen numbers without finding out anything , while Mrs. Floyd sat there and kept up a running harangue about mothers who run off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their children . As a last resort she had rung Mrs. Biederhof , and while that lady told her which hospital Ray had been taken to , and one or two other things , her syrupy good wishes had n't exactly put Mildred in a good humor . Now , after a dash to Los Angeles and a quick look at Ray , she was sitting with Bert , Veda , Mom , and Mr. Pierce at one end of the hospital corridor , waiting for the doctor , listening to Bert rehearse exactly what had happened : Ray had been dull Friday night , and then yesterday at the beach , when she seemed to be running a temperature , they had called Dr. Gale , and he had advised taking her to a hospital . Mom interruptedBert and corrected : The doctor had n't done no such a thing . He had ordered her home and they had taken her home . But when they got there with her the house was all locked up and they rang him again . It was then that he ordered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take her . Mildred wanted to ask what was the matter with the Pierces ' house , but made herself swallow it back . Bert took up the story again : There was nothing serious the matter , just a case of grippe , not flu , as Mildred had been told . " That strip of adhesive on her lip do n't mean a thing . They opened a little pimple she had , that 's all . " Mom took the floor again , making more insinuations , until Mildred said : " I do n't know that it 's any of your business where I was , or anybody else 's . " Mom turned white , and sat bolt upright , but Mr. Pierce spoke quickly , and she sank back , her lips compressed . Then Mildred , after trying to keep quiet , went on : " I was at Lake Arrowhead , if you have to know . When some friends invited me up to theirp 104 cottage by the lake , I did n't see why I was the one person on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have . That I readily admit . But I did n't know at the time that I had a set of in-laws that could n't even find a place for a sick child that had been left in their care . I 'll certainly know better next time . " " I think Mother 's perfectly right . " Up to now , Veda had been coldly neutral , but when she heard about the swank cottage by the lake , she knew exactly where she stood . Bert looked unhappy , and said nothing . Mr. Pierce had a solemn rebuke : " Mildred , everybody did the best they knew , and I do n't see any need for personal remarks . " " Who started these personal remarks ? " Nobody had an answer for this , and for a time there was silence . Mildred had little appetite for the wrangle , for deep down in her heart she had a premonition that Ray was really sick . After an interminable time Dr. Gale arrived . He was a tall , stooped man who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Mildred into the sickroom , looked at Ray , listened to the night nurse 's whisper . Then he spoke reassuringly : " We get a lot of these cases , especially at this time of year . They shoot up a temperature , start running at the nose , refuse everything you give them to eat , and you 'd think they were blowing up something really bad . Then next day they 're out running around . Though I do n't mind telling you I 'm glad we 've got her here instead of home . Even in a case of grippe you ca n't be too careful . " " I 'm glad you opened that pimple . I meant to , day before yesterday  --  andthen I forgot it . " " Well I 'm glad you did n't open it . Those things , the rule is to let them strictly alone , especially on the upper lip . I did n't open it . I put that little strip over it to keep her fingers off it , that 's all . " Mildred took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stopped by Saturday and invited her up to the lake . She named no names , but made them quite rich and high-toned . She was undressed , with the light out , before she remembered her pies . It was three o'clock before she got to bed , and she was exhausted . All next day she had an unreasoning , hysterical sense of being deprived of something her whole nature craved : the right to sit with her child , to be near it when it needed her . And yet the best she could manage was a few minutes in the morning , an hour after supper . She had got to the hospital early , and wasn'tp 105 at all reassured by the nurse 's cheery talk . And her heart had contracted when she saw Ray , all her bubbling animation gone , her face flushed , her breathing labored . But she could n't stay . She had to go , to deliver pies , to pay off painters , to check on announcements , to contract for chickens , to make more pies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then she could n't eat . She fidgeted while Lefty served Veda , then loaded Veda in the car , and took her in for another vigil . Home again , she put Veda to bed , but when she went to bed herself , she could n't sleep . She called the hospital at eight the next morning , and after getting a favorable report , stayed on the phone , crowding her business into the next two hours . Around ten , she loaded her pies into the car , made the rounds of delivery , and arrived at the hospital about eleven . She was surprised to find Dr. Gale already there , whispering in the corridor with a big hairy man in an undershirt , with tattoo marks on his arm . He called Mildred aside . " Now I do n't want you to get alarmed . But her temperature'sgone up . It 's a hundred and four now , and I do n't like it . I do n't like it , and I do n't like that thing on her lip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know , and there 's no way to tell . I 've taken a smear from the pimple , another from the mucus that 's coming from her nose , and a couple of CC 's of blood . They 're on their way to the laboratory now . They 'll ring me as soon as they possibly can . But Mildred , here 's the point . If we 've got trouble there , she ca n't wait for any lab report . She 's got to have a transfusion , right away . Now I 've got this man here , he 's a professional donor , but it 's his means of livelihood , and he wo n't go in the room till he gets his twenty-five dollars . It 's entirely up to you , but  --  " Without a thought of what twenty-five dollars would do to her little reserve , Mildred was writing the check before he finishedtalking . The man demanded an indorsement . Dr. Gale signed , and Mildred , her hands sweating with fear , went into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowels that she had had that day on the boulevard . The child 's eyes were dull , her face hot , her whimpering a constant accompaniment to her rapid breathing . There was a new strip on her lip , a bigger one , covering a pack of gauze stained with the livid red of mercurochrome . A nurse looked up , but did n't stop spooningp 106 ice into the fluttering little mouth . " This happened after I talked to you , Mrs. Pierce . She had a nice night , temperature constant , and we thought she 'd be all right in a few hours . Then just like that it went up . " Ray began to fret , and the nurse began talking to her , saying it was her mother , and did n't she know her mother ? Mildred spoke to her . " It 's Mamma , darling . " " Mamma ! " Ray 's voice was a wail , and Mildred wanted to gather her into her aims , but she merely took one of the little hands and patted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in white smocks , and nurses , and the donor , his sleeves rolled high this time , showing a veritable gallery of tattoo marks . He sat down , and Mildred stood like a woman of stone while a nurse swabbed his arm . Then she went out in the corridor and started walking up and down , quietly , slowly . Somehow , by a supreme effort of will , she made time pass . Then two nurses came out of the room , then one of the doctors , then the donor , and some orderlies . She went in . The same nurse , the one who had spoken to her before , was at the head of the bed , busy with thermometer and watch . Dr. Gale was bent over , peering intently at Ray . " Her temperature'sdown , doctor . " " Good . " " A hundred and one . " " That 's just great . How 's the pulse ? " " Down too . To ninety-six . " " That 's wonderful . Mildred , I 've probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just the same  --  " They walked out to the corridor , came , to an angle , went on . He resumed talking in a casual way : " I hated to do it , Mildred , just hated to slap that outlay on you  --  though I 'll see that every charge is as reasonable as they can make it . But if I had it to do over again , I 'd tell you just what I told you before . You see , here 's what we 're up against . Any infection above the mouth drains into the lateral sinus , and that means the brain . Now with that little pip on her lip there was no way to tell . Every symptomshe had spelled grippe , but just the same , all of those symptoms could have been caused by strep , and if we had waited until we were sure , it would have been too late . The way she 's reacting to that transfusion shows it was all a false alarm  --  but I 'm telling you , if it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd never have forgiven myself , and neither would you . " p 107 " It 's all right . " " These things happen , they ca n't be helped . " Somewhere on the floor a buzzer sounded , then sounded again , sharply , insistently . It seemed to Mildred that Dr. Gale turned rather quickly , that their saunter was no longer a saunter . As they approached the room an orderly hurried past them , carryinghot-water bottles . He entered the room . When they went in , the nurse was jamming them under the covers , which were thick with the extra blankets she had already piled on . " She 's having a chill , doctor . " " Orderly , get Dr. Collins . " " Yes sir . " From the ice that was forming around her heart , Mildred knew it was no false alarm this time . She sat down , watched Ray 's face turn white , then blue ; when the little teeth began to chatter she looked away . An orderly came in with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking up . He was followed by Dr. Collins , a short , heavy man who bent over Ray and studied her as though she were an insect . " It 's the pimple , Dr. Gale . " " I ca n't believe it . She reacted to that transfusion  --  " " I know it . " Dr. Collins turned to an orderly and snapped orders in a curt , clipped voice : for oxygen , adrenalin , ice . The orderly went . Both doctors studied Ray in silence , the chattering of her teeth the only sound in the room . After a long time the nurse looked up . " Her pulse is faster , Dr. Collins . " " What is it ? " " A hundred and four . " " Take off the hot-water bottles . " As the nurse pulled out the hot-water bottles and dropped them to the floor the room began to fill . Other nurses appeared , wheelingan oxygen apparatus and a white table full of vials and syringes . They stood around , as though waiting . Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . Then red spots appeared on her cheeks , and the nurse felt her forehead . " Her temperature 's rising , Dr. Collins . " " Take off the blankets . " Two nurses stripped off the blankets and a third stepped forward with icebags , which she packed around Ray 's head . For a long time they were all motionless , and there was no sound exceptRay 's labored . ea ing. and the first nurse 's report on the 108 pulse : " A hundred and twelve .... A hundred and twenty-four . .. A hundred and thirty-two .... " Presently Ray was panting like a little dog , and her whimperinghad a pitiful note in it that made Mildred want to cry out against the injustice that one so small , so helpless , should have to bear such agony . But she sat perfectly still , not distracting by so much as a movement the attention of those on whom Ray 's ' chance depended . The child 's struggle went on and on , and then suddenly Mildred tightened . The breathing stopped for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , harrowing gasps , then stopped altogether . Dr. Collins motioned quickly , and two nurses stepped forward . They had scarcely begun their rapid lifting and lowering of Ray 's arms before Dr. Gale had the mask of the oxygen apparatus over her face , and Mildred caught the thunderstorm smell of the gas . Dr. Collins filed the neck of a vial , snapped it off . Quickly filling a syringe , he lifted the covers and jabbed it into Ray 's rump . The first nurse had Ray 's wrist , and Mildred saw her catch Dr. Collins 's eye and glumly shake her head . The artificial respiration went steadily on . After a minuteor two , Dr. Collins refilled his syringe , again jabbed it into Ray 's rump . Another minute went by , and Mildred saw glances exchanged between nurses . As Dr. Collins refilled his syringe , she stood up . She knew the truth , and she also knew that one more jab into the lifeless little bottom would be more than she could stand . She lifted the mask of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , and pulled the sheet over her face . She was sitting in the alcove again , but here it was Dr. Gale who broke down , not she . The cruel suddenness of it had left her numb , as though she had no capacity to feel , but as he approached , his stoop was a tottering slump . He dropped down beside her , took off his glasses , massaged his face to keep it from jerking . " I knew it . I knew it when I saw that orderly , running with the bottles . From then on there was no hope . But  --  we do everything we can . We ca n't give up . " Mildred stared straight ahead of her , and he went on : " I loved her like she was mine . And there 's only one thing I can say . I did everything I could . If anything could have saved her , that transfusion would  --  and she had it . And you too , Mildred . We both did everything that could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both swallowing , both lockingp 109 their teeth behind twitching lips . Then , in a different tone , he asked : " You got any choice on an undertaker , Mildred ? " " I do n't know any undertaker . " " I generally recommend Mr. Murock , out there in Glendale , just a few blocks from you . He 's reasonable , and wo n't run up charges on you , and he 'll attend to everything the way most peoplewant it done . " " If you recommend him , then it 's all right . " " I 'll call him . " " Is there a phone around ? " " I 'll find you one . " He took her to a little office on the same floor , and she sat down and dialed Mrs. Biederhof . She asked for Bert , but he was out , and she said : " Mrs. Biederhof , this is Mildred Pierce . Will you tell Bert that Ray died a few minutes ago ? At the hospital . I wanted him to know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellowing silence , and then : " Mrs. Pierce , I 'll tell him . I 'll tell him just as soon as I can find him , but I want to tell you that I 'm sorry from the bottom of my heart . Now is there anything I can do ? " " No , thank you . " " Can I take Veda for a little while ? " " No , thanks ever so much . " " I 'll tell him . " " Thank you , Mrs. Biederhof . " She drove home mechanically , but after a few blocks she began to dread the stop signals , for sitting there , waiting for the light to change , she would have time to think , and then her throat would clutch and the street begin to blur . When she got home , Bert came out to meet her , and took her into the den , where Letty was trying to quiet Veda . Letty went back to the kitchen , and Veda broke into loud sobs . Over and over , she kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mother , I cheated her out of it , and I meant to pay it back , but  --  I owed her a nickel ! " Soothingly , Mildred explained that if she really meant to pay it back , this was the main thing , and presently Veda was quiet . Then she began to fidget . Mildred kissed her and said : " Would you like to go over to your grandfather 's , darling ? You could practice your piano lessons , or play , or whatever you want to do . " " Oh Mother , do you think it would be right ? " " Ray would n't mind . "  | Veda trotted out of the house , and Bert looked a little shocked . " She 's a child , Bert . They do n't feel things the way we feel them . It 's better that she not be here while  --  arrangements are being made . " Bert nodded , wandered about the room . A match in the fireplacecaught his attention , and he stooped to pick it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been hit with an axe he could n't have collapsed more completely . Instinctively , Mildred knew why : poking into the fireplace had brought it all back , the game he used to pay with Ray , all the gay nonsense between the elephant and the monk . Mildred led him to the sofa , took him in her arms . Then together , in the darkened room , they mourned their child . When he could speak , he babbled of Ray 's sweet , perfect character . Ile said if ever a kid deserved to be in heaven she did , and that 's where she was all right . Goddam it , that 's where she was . Mildred knew this was a solace from a pain too great for him to bear : that he was taking refuge in the belief she was n't really dead . Too realistic , too literal-minded , to be stirred much by the idea of heaven , she nevertheless craved relief from . this aching void inside of her , and little heat lightnings began to shoot through it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she fought them off . The phone rang . Bert answered , and sternly said there had been a death in the family , and that Mrs. pierce could n't possiblytalk business today . Mildred barely heard him . The restaurantseemed remote , unreal , part of a world that no longer concerned her . Around three thirty , Mr. Murock arrived . He was a roly-poly little man , and after seven seconds of purring condolences , he got down to brass tacks . Everything in connection with the body had been taken care of . In addition , notices had been placed in the afternoon papers , though the morning notices would have to wait until Mildred decided when she wanted the funeral , so perhaps that should be the first thing to consider . Mildred tried to get her mind on this , but could n't . She was grateful to Bert when he patted her hand and said he would attend to all that . " Fact of the matter , Pop wants to stand the expense , anyhow . He and Mom , they both wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to wait a little while . " " I 'm glad you came alone . " " But Pop , he wants to stand the expense. * " Then you attend to it . " So Bert talked to Mr. Murock , apparently knowing instinctively what she wanted . He set the time of the funeral at noon the next day . " No use stringing it out , " a point to which Mr. Murock instantlyagreed . The grave could be dug in the Pierce family plot in Forest Lawn Cemetery , which had been acquired on the death of the uncle who left Bert the ranch . Services were to be conducted at the house , by the Rev. Dr. Aldous , whom Mr. Murock said he knew very well , and would call at once . Dr. Aldous was Bert 's rector , and for a miserable moment Mildred felt ashamed that she could claim no rector as her own . As a child she had gone to the Methodist Sunday school , but then her mother had begun to shop around , and finally wound up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astrologers , she reflected unhappily , did n't quite seem to fill the bill at this particulartime . On the choice of a casket , Bert haggled bravely , bringing all his business judgment to bear , and presently settled on a white enamelled one , with silver handles and satin lining , which would be furnished complete for $200 , with two limousines and the usual bearers . Mr. Murock got up . The body , he said , would be delivered at five , and they took him to the door , on which two assistants had already fastened a white crepe . Mr. Murock paused a moment to inspect the wire frames they were erecting in the living room , for flowers . Then he started . " Oh  --  I almost forgot . The burial clothes . " Mildred and Bert went back to the children 's room . They decided on the white dress Ray had worn at the school pageant , and with the little pants , socks , and shoes , they packed it in one of the children 's little valises . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and Mildred once more had to pat him back to normal . " She 's in heaven , she 's got to be . " " Of course she is , Bert . " " I know goddam well she 's not anywhere else . " A minute or two after Mr. Murock left , Mrs. Gessler came over and joined them in the den . She slipped in without a greeting , sat down beside Mildred , and began patting her hand with the infinite tact that seemed to be the main characteristic of her outwardlybawdy nature . It was a minute or two before she spoke . Then : " You want a drink , Bert ? " " Not right now , Lucy . " p 112 " It 's right there , and I 'm right here . " " Thanks , I 'd rather not . " Then to Mildred : " Baby , Mamma 's listening . " " There 's a couple of things , Lucy . " Mildred took her to the bedroom , wrote a number on a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tell her ? Say I 'm all right , and the funeral is tomorrow at twelve , and  --  be nice to her . " " I 'll do it on my phone . Anything else ? " " I have no black dress . " " I 'll get one for you . Size twelve ? " " Ten . " " Veil ? " " Do you think I should ? " " I would n't . " " Then no veil . And no hat . I have one that 's all right . And no shoes . I have them too . But  --  gloves . Size six . And I think I ought to have a mourning handkerchief . " " I 'll have everything . And  --  " " What is it , Lucy ? " " They 'll be dropping in now . People , I mean . And  --  I 'll probably pull something . I just thought I 'd tell you , so you 'll know I had a reason . " So a little while later , Mrs. Gessler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite a few people were there : Mrs. Floyd , Mrs. Harbaugh , Mrs. Whitley , Wally , and to Mildred 's surprise , Mr. Otis , the federal meat inspector , who had seen the notice in one of the afternoon papers . Letty 's contribution was tea and sandwiches , which she had just begun to pass when Mrs. Gessler came in , hatted , gloved , and carrying a gigantic set of lilies . With a wave of the hand she dismissed the florist 's driver , and finding the card , read : " Mr. and Mrs. Otto Hildegardeoh , are n't they beautiful , just beautiful ! " Then , to everybody in the room : " You know , the couple Mildred visited over the weekend , up at the lake . Lovely people . I 'm just crazy about them . " Then Mildred knew that there had indeed been talk , serious talk . But she also knew , from the look that went around , that now it was squelched , once and for all . She felt a throb of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been helpless to deal with herself . Bert took the lilies outside , where he spread them on the lawn . Then , coupling up the hose , he attached the revolving nozzle , so they were gently refreshedp 113 by the edge of the whirling spray . Other flowers came , and he set them out too , until there was a canopy of blossoms on the grass , all glistening with tiny drops . There was a basket of gladioluses from the Drop Inn , which touched Mildred , but the one that made her swallow hardest was a mat of white gardenias , to which was attached a blue-bird card , reading : Ida Anna Chris MakadoulisErnestine Maybelle ArchieEthel Laura SamFlorence Shirley X ( Fuji ) As she was fingering this a hush fell over the room , and she turned to see Mr. Murock 's assistants carrying Ray in the door . Under Bert 's direction , they set up trusses near the window , arrangedthe casket , and stepped back to permit the guests to pass by . Mildred could n't look . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of herself . In the setting sun , a rainbowwas shimmering over the spray , framing Ray 's head . This broke Bert up again , and most of the guests tip-toed silently out . But it left Mildred unstirred . There was something unreal about Ray 's appearance . The hot flush of the last few minutes was gone , also the animation of life , also the deadly pimple . All that remained was a waxy pallor that suggested nothing but heaven , which Bert was now babbling about for the fourth or fifth time . Letty served the rest of the sandwiches for supper , and Bert and Mildred ate tremulously , silently , hardly tasting what was put in front of them . Then Mr. Pierce and Mom arrived , with Veda , and after viewing Ray , came back to the den . Then Dr. Aldous arrived , a tall , gray , kindly man who sat near Mildred , and did n't put her on the defensive at all for not being a member of his church . Then Mom and Dr. Aldous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Dr. Aldous having little to say , and Mr. Pierce correcting Mom on a number of points of ritual . The trouble was that Mom , who had been originally a Methodist , only joining the Episcopal Church after marrying Mr. Pierce , was somewhat confused as to the service that was to be used tomorrow . As Mr. Pierce told her , she had the burial service , the communion service , the psalms , and perhaps even the wedding service , so thoroughly mixed up that it was rather difficult to disentangle them . Mom said she did n't care , she wanted the twenty-third psalm , it was only right they should have it whenp 114 the child was dead , and also there was no use telling her there would be no praying for the child 's soul . What were they doing there , anyway ? Mr. Pierce sharply reminded her that the burial service had nothing to do with a soul . The whole point was that the soul had already gone , and the burial was nothing but the commitment of a body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Dr. Aldous , as a sort of referee . That gentleman , listening with bowed head , presently said : " As the child was n't baptized , certain changes will have to be made in the service anyway . Small omissions , but I 'm required to make them . Now , in that case , there 's no reason why the Twenty-third Psalm , and the little passage in the Communion Service that Mrs. Pierce evidently has in mind , and whatever else we want , ca n't be included . At the end of the service , special prayers can be , and often are , offered , and I 'll be very glad to include these passages  --  that is , if the mother feels the need of them too . " He looked at Mildred , who nodded . At first , she had resented Mom 's taking charge in this high-handed way , and felt mean remarksrising within her . Just in time , she had remembered that the Pierces were paying for everything , and kept her reflections to herself . Now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , so the Pierces could have her back in the morning , properly dressed . When she came out with the little suitcase , the Pierces decided it was time to go . Dr. Aldous , however , stayed a few minutes longer . Taking Mildred 's hand , he said : " I 've often thought the burial service could be a little more intimate , a little more satisfying to the emotions , than it is . It 's quite true , as Mr. Pierce said , that it is the commitment of a body , not the consecrationof a soul . Just the same , most people find it hard to make the distinction , and  --  to them , what they see is n't a body . It 's a person , no longer alive , but still the same person , loved and terribly mourned . . . . Well , I hope I can arrange a little service that will be satisfactory to the old lady , and the mother , and father , and  --  everybody . " After Dr. Aldous left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally . She still had to make the inexorable pies , and as he kept her company in the kitchen , and even helped her where he could , he gave details of what had happened at the beach , and she reciprocated with a final version of what happened at the lake , making it correspond with Mrs. Gessler 's version , though not feeling any particular desire to deceive . Shep 115 merely wanted to be friendly . Bert nodded when she got to the part about Mrs. Floyd . " One hell of an end to a nice vacation . " " I did n't care what she thought . But about Ray , I could feel it , even before I got to the hospital . I knew it , even then . " When the pies were made , they sat with Ray for a time , then went back to the den . She said : " You do n't have to worry about me , Bert . If Mrs. Biederhof is waiting up for you , why do n't you run along ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yeah , I 'm sure . " " ... She was awfully nice . " " Mildred , can I tell you something ? About what really happenedSaturday ? " " Certainly . " " Mom , she was just scared , that was all . Mom was never any good in a spot like that . And me , maybe I take after her , because I was scared too . That 's why , when Doc Gale began talking hospitalI fell for it so quick . But Maggie , she was n't scared . We had to stop there , on our way to the hospital , because I was still in my beach shorts , and I had to put on some pants . And Maggie , she raised hell about taking Ray to the hospital . She wanted to bring her right in , then and there . That 's what I wanted too . It seemed a hell of a note , a poor little kid , and nobody even had a place for her . But  --  I did n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what happened , it does her credit . " " She 's a goddam good friend . " " If that 's what she did , I want you to thank her for me , and tell her I would have been only too glad . It was better that she was brought to the hospital , but if she had been put in Mrs. Biederhof 's care , I would n't have had any objection at all . And I know she 'd have been properly taken care of , well taken care of . " " She 's as broken up as if it was her own child . " " I want you to tell her . " " And will she be glad to her it . " Bert got wood , and made a fire , and lit it . The next Mildred knew , it was daylight , and one arm was asleep , and her head was on Bert 's shoulder . He was staring into the embers of the fire . " Bert ! I must have been asleep . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sleep ? " p 116 " I 'm all right . " They went in with Ray for a few minutes , and then Bert went out to look at the flowers . The spray was still whirling , and he reported they were " as fresh as when they were cut . " She got a dustcloth and began moving about the house , cleaning , dusting , putting things in order . Presently she got breakfast , and they ate it in the kitchen . Then he took his departure , to dress . Around ten , Mrs. Gessler came over , with the black dress , and took the pies , for delivery . Then the Pierces arrived , with Bert , in a dark suit , and Veda , in white . Then Letty arrived , in a Sundaydress of garnet silk . Before her clean apron could be issued , Mildred saw the Engels drive up with her mother , and sent her out to let them in . When Mildred heard them in the den , she sent Veda to say she would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress , noted with relief that it was a fair fit . Quickly she got into the rest of her costume . Carrying the black gloves , she went to the den . Her mother , a small , worried-looking woman , got up and kissed her , as did her sister Blanche . Blanche was several years older than Mildred , and had a house-wifey look , with some touch about her of the ineffectuality that seemed to be the main characteristicof the mother . Neither of them had the least trace of the resolute squint that was the most noticeable thing about Mildred 's face , nor did they share her voluptuous figure . Harry Engel , the unfortunate possessor of the anchor inventory , got up and shook hands , awkwardly and self-consciously . He was a big , raw-boned man , with a heavy coat of sunburn and a hint of the sea in his large blue eyes . Then Mildred saw William , a boy of twelve , in what was evidently his first long-pants suit . She shook hands with him , then remembered she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment . He sat down , and resumed his unwinking stare at Veda . To Veda , the Engels were the scum of the earth , and William was even scummier than his parents , if that was possible . Under his stare she became haughtily indifferent , crossing one bored leg over the other , and fingering the tiny cross which hung from a gold chain around her neck . Mildred sat down , and Mr. Pierce resumed his account of the catastrophe , giving a fair version this time , with full faith and credence to Mildred 's visit to the Hildegardes , at Lake Arrowhead . Mildred closed her eyes and hoped he would make it long , and complete , so she would n't have to talk herself . Bert tiptoedp 117 over and took the receiver off the hook , so there would be no jangling phone bell . But when Letty , now aproned , came in to ask if anybody wanted coffee , the Engels stiffened , and Mildred knew something had gone wrong . As soon as the girl had gone , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had all shaken hands , taking her for " a friend . " Mildred tried to shrug it off , but Blanche was quite bitter about it , obviously feeling that Letty had compromisedher social position in front of the Pierces . Mildred began getting annoyed , but it was Veda who put an end to the discussion . With an airy wave of her hand , she said : " Well personally , I do n't see why you should object to shaking hands with Letty . She 's really a very nice girl . " While all of Veda 's delicately shaded accents were soaking in , the sound of the hose stopped . When Mildred went to look , Mr. Murock was carrying flowers in the front door , to place them on the wire racks , and his assistants were carrying in chairs . I am the resurrection and the life , saith the Lord ; he that believethin me , though he were dead , yet shall he live ; and whosoeverliveth and believeth in me , shall never die . It was n't the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though something had struck her . Sitting there in the bedroom with Bert and Veda , the door open so they could hear , she had expected something different , something warm , something soothing , particularly after Dr. Aldous 's remarks of last night . And then this flat , far-away whine , with a dreadful note of cold finality in it , began intoning the service . Not naturally religious , she bowed her head as if from some ancient instinct , began shuddering from the oppression that closed over her . Then Veda said something . Somewhere she had dug up a prayer book , and it was a moment before Mildred realized she was reading responses : " For they shall see God . . . . Henceforth , world without end . . . . And let our cry come unto thee .... " To the critical ear , Veda 's enunciation might have seemed a bit too loud , a shade too clear , as though intended for the company in the living room , rather than God . But to Mildred , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat lightnings began to flicker within her , and once more she fought them down . After a long time , when she thought she would scream if she did n't get some relief from her woe , the far-away voice stopped , and Mr. Murock appeared at the door . She wondered if she could walk to the p| 118 curb . But Bert took her arm and Veda her hand , and she went slowly through the living room . Quite a few people were there , half-remembered faces from her youth , grotesquely marked by time . Jesus saith to his disciples , Ye now therefore have sorrow . It was the same cold , far-away voice , and looking across the open grave , with the casket over it , Mildred saw it indeed came from Dr. Aldous , though he looked old and frail in his white robes . In a moment , however , he dropped his voice , adopted a softer , more sympathetic tone , and as she caught the familiar words , " The Lord is my shepherd ; I shall not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the special prayers made necessary by Mom 's stipulations , and for intimate solace . They murmured on , and her lips began to twitch as she realized they were mainly for her benefit , to ease her pain . They only made her feel worse . Then , after an interminable time , she heard : " 0 God , whose mercies can not be numbered ; Accept our prayers on behalf of the soul of Moire , thy servant departed , and grant her an entrance into the land of light and joy , in the fellowship of the saints ; through Jesus Christ our Lord . Amen . " And as the child sank down , on Mr. Murock 's patent pulleys , Mildred realized , with bitter shame , that now for the first time , in death , it heard itself correctly addressed , that it had lived its brief life without even knowing its name . The worst came that evening , when she was left alone , with nobody to console , nobody to be brave in front of , nobody to face but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bert with them , and the Engels shortly after , taking her mother , so as to reach San Diego before dark . Then , after an early supper , she had Letty take Veda to a moving picture show . Then she found herself in a house from which all flowers , all chairs , all wire racks had been removed , which was exactly as it had been before . Desolation swept over her . She tramped around , then changed into her smock and began making pies . Around eleven she drove to the theatre , took Letty home , and held tight to Veda 's hand on the way back to the house . Veda had a glass of milk , and talked gaily about the picture . It was called The YellowTicket , and Mildred winced at the circumstantial account of how Miss Elissa Landi had pulled out the gun and shot Mr. Lionel Barrymore in the stomach . When Veda went to bed , p 119 Mildred helped her undress , and could n't bring herself to leave . Then : " Would you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mother , of course ! " Mildred was pretending to herself that she was doing Veda a kindness , but Veda was n't one to let such a spot go to somebody else . She immediately began to give comfort , in large , clearly articulated , perfectly grammatical gobs . " Why you poor , dear Mother ! You lamb . Think of all she 's been through today , and the beautiful way she 's looked after everybody , without giving one thought to herself ! Why of course I 'll sleep with you , Mother ! You poor darling ! " To Mildred it was fragrant , soothing oil in a gaping wound . They went to her bedroom , and she undressed , and got into bed , and took Veda into her arms . For a few minutes she breathed tremulous , teary sighs . But when Veda nestled her head down , and blew into her pajamas , the way she used to blow into Ray 's , the heat lightnings flickered once , then drove into her sorrow with a blinding flash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gave way to this thing she had been fighting off : a guilty , leaping joy that it had been the other child who was taken from her , and not Veda.  |p120ONLY  AN ACT of high consecration could atone for this , and some time during the night Mildred knew what it would be , and so knowing , found peace . She may have found a little more than peace . There was something unnatural , a little unhealthy , about the way she inhaled Veda 's smell as she dedicated the rest of her life to this child who had been spared , as she resolved that the restaurant must open today , as advertised , and that it must not fail . She was up at daybreak carrying out this resolution , setting out pie plates , flour , utensils , cans of supplies , all sorts of things , for removal to the model home . There was a great deal of stuff , and she packed it carefully into the car , but it required several trips . On the last one , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arline and a Filipino , to do double service as dish washer and vegetable peeler , named Pancho . Both had been engaged the previous week , on the recommendation of Ida . Arline , a small , half pretty girl of twenty-five , had n't looked very promising , but Ida had recommended her highly . Pancho , it seemed , was addicted to flashy clothes , and had thus incurred the enmity of Archie , but once he was in his kitchen regimentals he was absolutely all right . Mildred noted Pancho 's cream-colored suit , but wasted no time on it . She handed out uniforms and put them both to work . They were to give the place a thorough cleaning , and as soon as the front room was done , they were to hang the percale drapes that lay in a pile on the floor . She showed how the fixtures worked , and on Pancho 's assurance that he was a virtuoso with the screwdriver , she drove back to the house , picked up her pies , and made the rounds of delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she saw . Pancho had indeed made a fine job of the drapes : the fixtures were all up and he was hanging the last of them . Arline had put the tables around , so that what had been a dreary pile of wood , metal , and cloth in one corner was now a restaurant , warm , clean , and inviting . Mildred still had many things to do , butp 121 when the laundry service delivered her napkins and doilies , she could n't resist setting a table to see how it looked . To her , it was beautiful . The red-and-white check of the linen combined pleasantlywith the maple , and with Arline 's brick-red uniform , just as she had hoped it would . For a few minutes she lingered , drinking in the picture with her eyes . Then , after pointing out what was to be done in the kitchen , she got in the car again , to resume her errands . At the bank , she drew $30 , filling out the stub quickly , and trying not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Balance Forward . " She asked for $10 in change , against the requirements of the evening , dropped the rolls of coin into her handbag , and went on . At the ranch where her chickens were on order , she found twenty-six waiting for her , instead of the stipulated twenty . Mr. Gurney , the rancher , was quite voluble about it , saying them birds was in such prime condition he hated to see anybody else get them . Just the same , she was annoyed . He did raise fine chickens , honestly corn-fed , not milk-fed , and fine chickens she had to have . And yet she could n't have him overselling her like this . After fingering them for a time , she rejected two because they were n't properly picked and took the rest , paying $8 , the price being three for a dollar . Loading them into the car , she went to the U-3et market , for vegetables , eggs , bacon , butter , and groceries . She spent $11 , almost having to dig into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen , found it fairly satisfactory . Arline had mopped the floor , and Pancho had washed the new dishes without breaking any . Letty arrived , and Mildred had her make lunch for Arline and Pancho , then settled down to what she really liked , which was cooking . She got out the chickens , went over them carefully for pinfeathers , found Mr. Gurney 's picking a great deal better than most market picking . Then she took a small cleaver and sectioned them up . She was going to serve half a fried chicken , with vegetables or waffle , for 85c , but she hated the half chicken that was served in most places . It came on the table in one loathsome piece , and she wondered how people could possibly eat it . She was going to do it differently . First , she cut off the necks , then cut the chickens in half . Then she took off the wings and the legs . The legs she separated into second joints and drumsticks , and then she trimmed the breasts so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any wishbone or rib . Then , remembering Archie 's system for such things , she packed breasts , drumsticks , second joints , and wings into four different dishes , and placed them in the icebox so she could pick up a portion with one motion . The necks and bones she pitched into a pot , for soup . The giblets she cut up and put in a pan , for gravy . She started her other soup , the cream of tomato , and put Pancho to preparingvegetables . Around four , Wally came in , to inspect the alterations , and report . His main activity , since she had seen him , had been to send out the announcements , and for this he had drafted his secretary . She had utilized all the old Pierce Home lists , so that every person who had bought a home , or had even thought of buying a home , had been covered . Mildred listened , pleased that all this had been so well attended to , but he kept hanging around , and she wished he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed him looking at the showcase . This was the most expensive piece of furniture she had , and the only one that had been made to order . The base and back were of maple , but the sides , top , and shelves were of glass . It was to display the pies she hoped to sell to the " take-out " trade , and presently , looking rather self-conscious , Wally asked : " Well , how did you like that little surprise I fixed up for you ? " "  --  ? What surprise ? " " Did n't you see it ? " " I have n't seen anything . " " Hey  --  you go back to the kitchen , then , and wait , and believe me pretty soon you 're going to see something . " Mystified , she went to the kitchen , and still more mystified , saw Wally appear there in a moment or two , find her pies , and carry two into the restaurant , then two more , then two more . Then she could see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him fumbling with something against the wall . Then suddenly the showcase lighted up , and she gave a little cry , and went running out . Wally beamed . " Well , how do you like it ? " " Why Wally , it 's beautiful ! " " Something I did for you while  --  well , the last few days . I slipped in here at night and worked on it . " He proudly pointed out the tiny refleotors that screwed into the maple , almost invisibly , to shoot the light downward , on the pies ; the bulbs , nop 123 bigger than her finger ; the wiring , cunningly tacked to the back in such manner as to leave the panels free to slide . " You know how much that little job cost ? " " I have n't any idea . " " Well , let 's see now , the reflectors , they were seven cents apiece , six of them , that 's forty-two cents . The lights , a nickel apiece  --  say , they 're Christmas tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , that 's seventy-two cents . The wire , ten cents . The sockets , screws , and plug , maybe a dollar . Say altogether , a couple of bucks . How 's that ? " " I just ca n't believe it . " " Took me maybe an hour . But it ought to sell pies . " " And get a free dinner . " " Oh , never mind that . " " A free dinner , and second helpings . " But the clock was ticking inexorably on , and she hurried back to work as soon as he left , though in a pleasant glow now , feeling that everybody was trying to help her . The vegetables , started before Wally came , were now ready , and they took them up . She put them in their pots and turned the hot water into the steam table . She made waffle batter , laid beside it the dipper that held exactly one waffle . She made pie crust , for biscuits . Her ice cream arrived : chocolate , strawberry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a bench , where they could be easily reached , and showed Arline how to dip it up , reminding her she would be responsible for desserts as well as starters . She made salad , started the coffee . At five thirty she went to the ladies ' room to change for the evening . She had given considerable thought to what she would wear . She had decided on white , but not the sleazy white of the nurse uniforms then becoming so common . She went to Bullocks , and bought sharkskin dresses , of a shade just off white , white with a tint of cream in it , and had little Dutch caps made to go with them . Always vain of her legs , she had the dresses shortened a little . Now , she hurriedly got into one , put on her Tip-Top shoes , stuck on the little cap . As she hurried out carrying the apron she would wear in the kitchen , and slip off when she came out to greet the customers , she looked like the cook in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a number . She assembled Panchop 124 Letty , and Arline for final instructions , paying most attention to Arline . " I 'm not expecting many people , because it 's my first night and I have n't had a chance yet to build up my trade . But if you should be rushed , remember : Get their orders . I 've got to know whether they 're having vegetables or waffle before I can start , so do n't keep me waiting . " " Call them both ? " " Call the waffle only . " " Call biscuits ? " " I 'll keep biscuits out all the time , and you pick them up yourself . Pick up your own bread and your own biscuits , but put them in separate baskets and do n't forget that biscuits call for a napkin , to keep them hot . Three biscuits to a person , more if they want them , but do n't be stingy with them and do n't take time to count . Pick them up quick , and pick up enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , counting tables . There were eight tables for two , around the wall , and two tables for four , in the middle . Mildred saw the look , and went on : " You 'll be able to take care of them , if you get their orders . There 's plenty of room here , you 're using a tray , and that 'll help . Any time you need her , I 'll send Letty out to bus up your tables for you , and  --  " " Ca n't she do that right from the start ? So we get used to working together , and do n't commence bumping and stepping all over each other 's feet ? " " Then all right . " Lefty nodded , with a self-conscious grin . She was already in the brick-red uniform , which was quite becoming to her , and obviously wanted to be part of the show . Mildred went back to the kitchen , lit the oven , and started the waffle irons to heat . She was using a gas waffle , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned kind of round waffle that people really like . " She went to the switch box , put on the lights . The last switch worked the outside sign , and when it was on , she went out to look . There it was , as beautiful as ever , casting a bluish light over the trees . She drew a deep breath and came inside . At last she was open , at last she had her own business . There ensued a long wait . She sat nervously at one of the tables for two , while Arline , Letty , and Pancho stood in a corner whispering . Then they started to giggle , and a horrible pain shot through Mildred . It was the first time it had occurred to her thatp 125 she could open a restaurant , and then have nobody show up . She lurched suddenly to her feet and went to the kitchen . She kept touching the waffle irons , to see if they were hot . Outside , a car door slammed . She looked up . A car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had a moment of complacency as she reached for the chicken : now she would reap her reward for all her observing , thinking , and planning . She had had the free parking located in the rear , so she could see exactly how many customers she had , even before they came in ; she had simplified her menu , so she could start the chicken without waiting for the waitress to report ; she had placed her icebox , range , materials , and utensils so she could work with the minimum of effort . Feeling as though she were starting a well-tuned machine , she took out four each of breasts , second joints , drumsticks , and wings , rolled them in the flour box beside the range , gave them a squirt from the olive oil bottle that stood beside the flour . She shoved them in the oven , for the brief baking that preceded frying in butter . Not yet closingthe oven door , she shoved a pan of biscuits in , beside them . Arline appeared . " Four at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , one waf . " She reminded Arline she was not to call soup , but dip it up herself , then went out to greet her first guests . They were strangersto her , a man , woman , and two children , but she made them a pretty little speech , saying they were her first guests , and she hoped they liked her place and would keep on being her guests . Arline came in with the starters , the soup , crackers , butter , napkins , water , and salad . Salad , for some reason , is served first in California . Midred 's eye checked the tray , finding it in order . Two more people came in . She vaguely remembered them as Pierce Homes buyers of six or seven years Igo , but her waitress training came at once to her aid . Their names were on her tongue before she fairly saw their faces : " Why how do you do , Mrs. Sawyer , and Mr. Sawyer ! I 'm so glad you were able to come ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table in the corner . As soon as Arline came over to get their orders , she went back to the kitchen , to start more chicken . The first order went out smoothly , with Letty bussing the dirty dishes to Pancho , who went to work at once . But then Arline appeared , looking worried . " Two at No. 3 , but one of them 's a kid that wo n't have soup . Says she wants tomato juice with ap 126 piece of lemon and some celery salt  --  I told her we do n't serve it , but she says she 's got to have it and what do I do now ? " It was no trouble to guess who that was . She found Bert with Veda , at one of the tables for two . Bert was in a light suit , conscientiously groomed and brushed , but with a black band on one arm . Veda was in a school dress that had n't been worn yet , and Mildred 's floppy hat . Both of them looked up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bert nodding approvingly at the restaurant . " By God , this looks like something . You got yourself a piece of property this time , Mildred . This place is real . " He stamped his foot . " And it 's built . I saw to that . I bet there was no trouble with the Department of Health when they inspectedthis floor . " " They passed it without even looking . " " How about those toilets ? " " They passed them too . Of course , we had to cut a door through , so both of them opened into the old secretary 's office . We made that into a kind of lounge . It 's against the law for a toilet to open into the kitchen , you know . But that , and the painting , and the gravel , and the swing doors , were about all we had to do . It cost money though . Whew ! " " I bet it did . " ' Would you like to look around ? " " I 'd love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt proud when Bert admiredeverything profusely , not quite so proud when Veda said : " Well Mother I think you 've done very well , considering everything . " Then she heard a car door slam , and turned to greet her new customer . It was Wally , and he was quite excited . " Say , you 're going to have a mob . You heard me , a mob . That 's the thing to remember with direct-mail advertising . It 's not what you send . It 's where you send it . I got that stuff of yours right to the people that know you , and they 're coming . I bumped into six different people that told me they 'd be here  --  and that 's just six I happened to bump into . I said a mob . " Wally pulled over a chair and sat down with Bert and Veda . Bert asked him sharply if he had attended to the transfer of beneficiary on the fire insurance . Wally said he figured he 'd wait till the place burned down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Mildred looked up , Ida was standing in the door . Shep 127 went over and kissed her , and listened while she volubly explained that her husband had wanted to come , but got a call on a job , and simply had to look into it . Mildred took her to the table that now had only one chair , the other having been borrowedby Wally . Ida looked around , taking things in . " Mildred , it 's just grand . And the space you got . You can get two more fours in easy , just by shifting those twos a little bit . And you can use trays , big as you want . You got no idea how that 'll help . It 'll save you at least one girl . At least . " It was high time for Mildred to get back to the kitchen , but she lingered , patting Ida 's hand , basking in her approval . The well-oiled machine was in high now , humming smoothly , pulling its load . So far , Mildred had found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each new departure , to give a little reminder of the home-made pies she had for sale , and would n't they like to take home one ? But now she was workinga bit feverishly , frying chickens , turning waffles . When she heard a car door slam she did n't have a chance to look out and count customers . Then she heard another door slam . Then Arline appeared . " Two fours just come in , Mrs. Pierce . I got room for one but what do I do with the other ? I can shove two twos together , but not till I get Miss Ida moved out  --  " " No no ! Let her alone . " " But what 'll I do ? " " Seat four , ask the others to wait " In spite of herself , her voice was shrill . She went out , asked the second party of four if they minded waiting . She said she was a little rushed now , but it would only be for a few minutes . One of the men nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't foreseen this , and provided extra chairs . When she got to the kitchen , Arline was jabbering at Pancho , then turned furiouslyto Mildred : " He 's washing plates , and the soup bowls are all out , and if he do n't let me have them I ca n't serve my starters ! Soup bowls , stupid , soup bowls ! " Arline screamed this at Pancho , but as Mildred shushed her down , Letty came in , heavy footed and clumsy at unaccustomed work , and dumped more soup bowls on the pile , which went down with a crash , three breaking . Mildred made a futile dive to save them , and heard another car door slam . And suddenly she knew that her machine was stalled , that her kitchen was swamped , that she had completely lost track of her orders , thatp 128 not even a starter was moving . For one dreadful moment she saw her opening turning into a fiasco , everything she had hoped for slipping away from her in one nightmare of an evening . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucking it with her handbag beside the tin box that held the cash , slipping into an apron . " O.K. , Mildred , it 's them dishes that 's causing it all . Now she ai n't no good out there , none whatever , so let her wipe while he washes , and that 'll help . " As Mildred nodded at Letty and handed her a towel , Ida 's quick eye spotted dessert dishes , and she set them out on a tray . Then , to Arline : " Call your soup . " " I want a right and left for two , three and one , chicken and tomato for four , and they been waiting for  --  " Ida did n't wait to hear how long they had been waiting . She dipped soup into the dessert dishes , dealt out spoons with one hand and crackers with the other , and hurried out with the tray , leaving butter , salad , and water to Arline . In a minute she wag back . " O.K. , Mildred , I got your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through eating anyway . Then I put two at my table , and that took care of four . Then soon as I get the check for that first party of four , that 'll take care of four more , and  --  " The twanging voice , the voice that Mildred had hated , twanged on , and Mildred responded to it with a tingle that started in her heart and spread out through the rest of her . Her nerve came back , her hands recovered their skill , as things began moving again . She was pouring a waffle when Mrs. Gessler appeared at the door , and came tiptoeing over to her . " Anything I can do , baby ? " " I do n't think so , Lucy . Thanks just the  --  " " Oh yes there is . " Ida seized Mrs. Gessler by the arm as she usually seized the members of her command . " You can take off that hat and get out there and sell pies . Do n't bother them while they 're eating but stay near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " " I 'll be doing my best . " " Containers in the drawer under the case , they 're out flat and you 'll have to fold them , then tie them up and put the carrying handles on . If you have any trouble , just call for me or ask Mildred . " " What 's the price , Mildred ? " " Eighty-five cents . Everything 's eighty-five cents . "  |p129Mrs  . Gessler laid her hat beside Ida 's and went out . Soon Mildred saw her come back , lay a dollar bill in the tin box , take change , and go out . In a short time she saw many bills in the box , as Ida repeatedly came in , made change , and sent Arline out with it , so she would get her tip . When she had a lull , she slipped off her apron and went out . Nobody was standing now , but every seat was filled , and she felt as she had felt yesterday , at the funeral , when she walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These were people she had n't seen in years , people reached by Wally 's clever system of mailing . She spoke to them , asked if everything was all right , received their congratulations , and from a few , words of sympathyabout Ray . It was well after eight when she heard another car door slam . Bert , Wally , and Veda had adjourned their meeting , on Ida 's invitation , to the running board of Wally 's car , and for some time she had heard them talking out there , while she worked . But now , as a foot crunched on the gravel , the conversation stopped , and then Veda burst in the back door . " Mother ! Guess who just came in ! " " Who was it , darling ? " " Monty Beragon ! " Mildred 's heart skipped a beat , and she looked at Veda sharply . But Veda 's shining eyes did n't suggest knowledge of scandal , so cautiousy she asked : " And who is Monty Beragon ? " " Oh , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . " " He plays polo for Midwick , and he lives in Pasadena , and tie 's rich , and good-looking , and all the girls just wait for his picture to come out in the paper . He 's  --  keen ! " It was the first she had known that Monty was anybody in particular , but she was too busy to be excited much . Veda began dancing up and down , and Bert came in , followed by Wally , who looked as though he had just beheld God . " Sa-a-a-a-a-y ! If that guy 's here , Mildred , you 're in ! Why there 's not a restaurant in L. A. that would n't pay him to eat there . Is n't that so , Bert ? " " He 's very well-known . " " Known ? Hell , he 's a shot . " Arline came in , from the dining room . " One waf . " Veda went to the out door , peeped , and disappeared into the ( lining room . Wally began speculating as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't on any list , and it seemed unlikely he had seen the Glendale papers . Bert , with some irritation , said that Mildred 's reputation as a cook had spread far and wide , and that seemed sufficient reason , at least to him , without doing any fancy sleuthing about it . Wally said by God he had a notion to find out , when all of a sudden he was standing there with open mouth , and Mildred felt herself being turned slowly around . Monty was there , looking down at her gravely , intently . " Why did n't you tell me about the little girl ? " " I do n't know . I  --  could n't call anybody . " " I did n't hear about it until her sister told me , just now . " " She seems to be quite an admirer of yours . " " She 's the most delightful little thing I 've met in a long time , but never mind about her . I 'd like you to know that if I 'd had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As though to corroborate this declaration , a box of flowers appeared suddenly under Mildred 's nose , together with a slip the messenger was offering her to sign . She opened the box , found herself staring at two gigantic orchids . But Monty took the card and tore it up . " I doubt if you 're in the humor for gags , " She put the flowers in the icebox , and introduced Bert and Wally . She was relieved when Ida came over , demanding that the kitchen be cleared . Monty gave her a little pat and went to the dining room . Bert and Wally went outside , eyeing her a little queerly . By nine o'clock there were only two customers left , and as they were eating the last of the chickens , Mildred went to the switchboard and cut off the sign . Then she counted her cash . She had hoped for thirty people , and had ordered fixe extra chickens to be safe . Now , having been highpressured into taking four more than that , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there had been a mob , and she found she had taken in $46 , or $10 more than her wildest hopes . She folded all the bills together , so she could feel their fat thickness . Then , having little to do until Arline , Pancho , and Letty finished up , she slipped off her apron , pinned on her orchids , and went into the dining room . Ida was still waiting on the last customers , but Bert , Wally , Monty , Veda and Mrs. Gessler were sitting sociably at one of the tables for four . Bert and Monty were discussing polo ponies , a subject that Bert seemed impressively familiar with . Veda hadp 131 curled herself into the crook of his arm and was drinking in the heavenly words about the only world that could mean anything to her . Mildred pulled up a chair and sat down beside Mrs. Gessler , who at once began making queer noises . Staring into each face , she repeated " H 'm ? H 'm ? " in an insistent way , evokingonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His face lit up and he bellowed " Yes ! " Then everybody bellowed yes , and Mrs. Gessler went out to her car . When she came back she had Scotch and White Rock . Mildred had Arline bring glasses , ice , and an opener , and Mrs. Gessler began her ancient rites . Bert took charge of Veda 's drink , but Mildred forbade the usual switcheroo . She knew it would remind him of Ray , and she did n't want that . Veda received her drink , with its two drops of Scotch , without any tricks , and Bert suddenly got to his feet . Raising his glass to Mildred , he said : " To the best little woman that any guy was crazy enough to let get away from him . " " You ought to know , you cluck . " Mrs. Gessler was quite positive about it , and everybody laughed , and raised a glass to Mildred . She did n't know whether to raise her glass or not , but finally did . Then Ida , having disposed of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviviality with a twisted grin that seemed strange and pathetic on her extremely plain face . Mildred jumped up , quickly made her a drink , and said : " Now I 'm going to propose a toast . " Raisingher glass , she intoned : " To the best little woman that nobody was ever crazy enough to let get away from them . " Wally said : " ' Ray ! " Everybody said " ' Ray ! " Ida was flustered , and first giggled , then looked as though she was going to cry , and paid no attention when Mildred introduced her around . Then she plopped down in a chair and began : " Well Mildred I wish you could have heard the comment . You got no idea how they went for that chicken . And how amazed they was at them waffles . Why , they said , they never got such waffles since they was little , and they had no idea anybody knew how to make them any more . It 's a hit , Mildred . It 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling trembly and self-conscious and unbearablyhappy . She could have sat there forever , but she had Veda to think of , and Ida to think of too , for after such help , she had to give her a lift home . So she reminded Bert that Veda had to go to school , p 132 stuffed the precious cash into her handbag , and prepared to lock up . She shook hands with them all , looking away quickly when she came to Monty , and finally got them outside . On the lawn , the party gathered around Mrs. Gessler 's car , and Mildred suspectedthe Scotch was being finished somewhat informally , but she did n't wait to make sure . Calling to Bert net to keep Veda up late , she loaded Ida into her car , and went roaring down the boulevard . When she got home she was surprised to find the blue Cord outside . Inside , the house was dark , but she could see a flicker of light from the den , and there she found Monty and Veda , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , and evidentlygetting on famously . To Mildred , Monty explained : " We had a date . " " Oh , you did . " " Yes , we made a date that I was to take her home , so I did . Of course we had to take Pop home first  --  " " Or at least , to the B  --  " But before Veda could finish her languid qualification , she and Monty burst into howls of laughter , and when she could get her breath she gasped : " Oh Mother ! We saw the Biederhof ! Through the window ! And  --  they flopped ! " Mildred felt she ought to be shocked , but the next thing she knew she had joined in , and then the three of them laughed until their stomachs ached and tears ran down their faces , as though Mrs. Biederhof and her untrammelled bosom were the funniest things in the world . It was a long time before Mildred could bring herself o send Veda to bed . She wanted to keep her there , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been there before . When the time finally came , she took Veda in herself , and helped her undress , and put her in bed , and held her tight for a moment , still ecstatic at the miracle that had come to pass . Then Veda whispered : " Oh Mother , is n't he just wonderful ! " " He 's terribly nice . " " How did you meet him ? " Mildred mumbled something about Monty 's having come into the Hollywood restaurant once or twice , then asked : " And how did you meet him ? " " Oh Mother , I did n't ! I mean , I did n't say anything to him . He spoke to me . He said I looked so much like you he knew who I was . Did you tell him about me ? " p 133 " Yes , of course . " " Then he asked for Ray , and when I told him about her , he turned perfectly pale , and jumped up , and- " " Yes , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want them ? " " Mother ! Mother ! " " All right , you can wear them to school . " From the sofa came a voice , a little thick , a little unsteady : " I 've been looking at that damned costume all night , and with great difficulty restrained myself from biting it . Now , get it off . " " Oh , I 'm not much in the humor for  --  " " Get it off . " So the costume came off , and she submitted to what , on the whole , seemed a reasonably appropriate finale to the evening . Yet she was too excited really to have her mind on Monty . When she went to bed she was tired , happy , and weepy , and Bert , Wally , Mrs. Gessler , Ida , Monty , the sign , the restaurant , and the $46 were all swimming about in a moonlit pool of tears . But the face that shimmered above it , more beautiful than all the rest , was Veda's.  |p134ONE  MORNING , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrowhead with Monty . He was part of her life now , though on the whole not quite so satisfactory a part as it had seemed , in that first week or two , that he might be . For one thing , she had discovered that a large part of his appeal for her was physical , and this she found disturbing . So far , her sex experiences had been limited , and of a routine , tepid sort , even in the early days with Bert . This hot , wanton excitement that Monty aroused in her seemed somehow shameful ; also , she was afraid it might really take possession of her , and interfere with her work , which was becoming her life . For in spite of mishaps , blunders , and catastrophes that sometimes reduced her to bitter tears , the little restaurant continued to prosper . Whether she had any real business ability it would be hard to say , but her commonsense , plus an industry that never seemed to flag , did well enough . She early saw that the wholesale pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept at the job of building it up , until it was paying all expenses , even above the wages of Hans , the baker that she hired . The restaurant intake had been left as clear profit , or what would become profit as soon as her debts , somewhat appalling still , were paid . That Monty might throw her out of step with this precious career was a possibility that distinctly frightened her . And for another thing , she felt increasingly the sense of inferioritythat he had aroused in her , that first night at the lake . Somehow , by his easy flippancy , he made her accomplishments seem small , of no consequence . The restaurant , which to her was a sort of Holy Grail , attained by fabulous effort and sacrifice , to him was the Pie Wagon , a term quickly taken up by Veda , who blandly shortened it to The Wagon . And even though he sometimesbrought his friends there , and introduced them , and asked her to sit down , she noticed they were always men . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met his family . Once , unexpectedly , he had pointed the car at Pasadena , and said hep 135 wanted her to see his home . She was nervous at the idea of meetinghis mother , but when they got there it turned out that both mother and sister were away , with the servants off for the night . At once she hated the big stuffy mansion , hated the feeling she had been smuggled in the back door , almost hated him . There was no sex that night , and he professed to be puzzled , as well as hurt , by her conduct . She had a growing suspicion that to him she was a servant girl , an amusing servant girl , one with pretty legs and a flattering response in bed , but a servant girl just the same . Yet she never declined his invitations , never put on the brake that her instinct was demanding , never raised the hatchet that she knew one day would have to fall . For there was always this delicious thing that he had brought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he came , that would go , she was afraid , when he went . Monty seemed devoted to Veda . He took her everywhere , to polo , to horse shows , to his mother 's , grantingher all the social equality that he withheld from Mildred , so that the child lived in , r horsy , streamlined heaven . Mildred lived in a heaven too , a heaven of more modest design , one slightly spoiled by wounded pride , but one that held the music of harps . She laved herself in Veda 's sticky affection , and bought , without complaining , the somewhat expensive gear that heaven required : riding , swimming , golf , and tennis outfits ; overnight kits , monogrammed . If Mildred knew nobody in Pasadena , she had the consolation that Veda knew everybody , and had her picture on the society pages so often that she became quite blase about it . And so long as this went on , Mildred knew she would put up with Monty , with his irritating point of view , his amused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not only put up with him , but cling to him . This particular morning , however , she was in a pleasant humor . She had slept well , after a romantic night ; it was early fall again , with the mountain trees turning yellow , and she was pontificating amiably about Mr. Roosevelt . She pontificated a great deal now , particularly about politics . She had n't been in business very long before she became furiously aware of taxes , and this led quite naturally to politics and Mr. Roosevelt . She was going to vote for him , she said , because he was going to put an end to all this Hoover extravagance and balance the budget . Why the very idea , she said , of all those worthless people demandinghelp , and this Hoover even considering doing anythingp 136 for them . There was nothing the matter with them except they were too lazy to work , and you could n't tell her that anybody could n't get along , even if there was a Depression , if they only had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smug note , an allusion to what she had done with a little gump . At any rate , he listened with half an ear , and then asked abruptly : " Can I tell you something ? " " If it 's pro-Hoover I do n't want to hear it . " " It 's about Veda . " " What 's she up to now ? " " Music . . . . Well what the hell , it 's not up to me to give you any advice . All I know is how the kid feels . " " She takes lessons . " " She takes lessons from some cheap little ivory thumper over in Glendale , and she has a squawk . She does n't think she 's gettinganywhere . Well  --  it 's none of my affair . " " Go on . " " I think she 's got something . " " I always said she had talent . " " Saying she has talent and doing the right thing about it are two different things . If you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about pies than you do about music . I think she ought to be put under somebody that can really take charge of her . " " Who , for instance ? " " Well , there 's a fellow in Pasadena that could do wonders with her . You may have heard of him  --  Charlie Hannen , quite wellknown , up to a few years ago , in the concert field . Then his lungs cracked up and he came out here . Does n't do much now . Organist , choir master , whatever you call it , at our church , leads a quiet life , but takes a few pupils . I 'm sure I can get him interested in her . If he takes her on , she 'll be getting somewhere . " " When did you learn so much about music ? " " I do n't know a thing about it . But my mother does . She 's been a patroness of the Philharmonic for years and she knows all about it . She says the kid 's really got it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This slightly waspish remark Monty let pass without answering , and it was some minutes before he went on . " And another thing that makes me think she 's got it is the way she works at it . All right , all I know is horses , but when I see a guy on top of one , out there in the morning when there 's nobody else around , p 137 popping away with a mallet to improve his backhand , I think to myself , maybe one day he 'll be a polo player . " " Is n't that something to be . " " It 's the same way with her . So far as I know , she never misses a day on that dry-goods box at her grandfather 's , and even when she comes over to Mother 's she does her two hours of exercises every morning , before she 'll even talk about tennis , or riding , or whatever Mother has in mind for her . She works , and you do n't even have to be a musician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost religious conviction that Veda had talent , Mildred was n't much impressed : she knew Veda too well to read the evidence quite as Monty read it . Veda 's earnest practicingat Mrs. Beragon 's might mean a consuming passion for music , and it might mean a consuming passion for letting the whole household know she was around . And Mr. Hannen might have been a celebrated pianist once , but the fact that he was now organist at one of Pasadena 's swank churches cast a certain familiar color over his nomination as teacher . All in all , Mildred was sure she detected one of Veda 's fine schemes . And in addition to that , she resented what was evidently becoming a small conspiracy to tell her what she should do about her child , and the implication that what she was already doing , by Pasadena standards , was n't anything like good enough . So for some time she said nothing about this subject to Veda . But it kept gnawing on her mind , setting up the fear that perhaps she was denying the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night Veda broke into a violent denunciation of Miss Whittaker , the lady to whom Mildred had been paying 50c a week to give Veda lessons ; but something about the tirade did n't have the usual phony sound to it . Troubled , Mildred asked suddenly if Mr. Hannen , of Pasadena , would be better . This producedsuch excited dancing around that she knew she was in for it . So she called up , made an engagement , and on the appointedafternoon rushed through her work so she could dash home and take Veda over there . For the occasion , she laid out some of . Veda 's new finery : a brown silk dress , brown hat , alligator-skin shoes , and silk stockings . But when Veda got home from school , and saw the pile on the bed , she threw up her hands in horror . " Mother ! I ca n't be dressed up ! Ooh ! It would be so provincial ! " Mildred knew the voice of society when she heard it , so she sighed , put the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of suit/able garb : maroon sweater , plaid skirt , polo coat , leather beret , woollen socks , and flat-heeled shoes . But she looked away when Veda started to dress . A year and a half had indeed made some changes in Veda 's appearance . She was still no more than medium height , but her haughty carriage made her seem taller . The hips were as slim as ever , but had taken on some touch of voluptuousness . The legs were Mildred 's , to the last graceful contour . But the most noticeable change was what Monty brutally called the Dairy : two round , swelling protuberances that had appeared almost overnight on the high , arching chest . They would have been large , even for a woman : for a child of thirteen they were positively startling . Mildred had a mystical feeling about them : they made her think tremulously of Love , Motherhood , and similar milky concepts . When Monty had denounced them as indecent , and told Veda for Christ 's sake to get a hammockto sling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and furious . But Veda had laughed gaily , and got brassieresin a completely matter-of-fact way . It would have been hard to imagine her pink-faced about anything . What with the chest , the Dairy , and the slightly swaying hips , she moved like some proud , pedigreed pigeon . Mr. Hannen lived just off the Pasadena traffic circle , in a house that looked usual enough from the outside , but which , inside , turned out to be one gigantic studio , with all the first floor and most of the second given over to it . It startled Mildred , not only by its size , but by its incredible bareness . There was nothing in it but a big piano , long shelves of music , a wooden wall seat across one end , and a bronze bust , in one corner , labelled BAUER . Mr. Hannen himself was a squat man of about forty , with bandy legs , thick chest , and big hands , though a slight stoop , as well as streaky white hair , hinted at the illness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatted with Mildred until she was off guard , and grew gabby . When she mentioned the restaurant , Veda tossed her head impatiently , but Mr. Hannen said " Ah ! " in a flattering way , remembered he had heard of it , copied down the address , and promised to come in . Then , rather casually , he got around to Veda , had a look at the music she had brought , and said they might as well get the horriblepart over . Veda looked a little set back on her heels , but he waved her to the piano and told her to play something  --  anything , so it was short . Veda marched grandly over , sat down on the bench , twisted her hands in a professional way , and medi-p 139 tated . Mr. Hannen sat down on the wall seat , near Mildred , and meditated . Then Veda launched into a piece known to Mildred as Rachmaninoff Prelude . It was the first time , in recent months , that Mildred had heard Veda play , and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite sure about , except that it made a fine noisy clatter . But there could be no mistaking the authoritative way in which Veda kept lifting her right hand high in the air , or the style with which she crossed her left hand over it . The piece kept mounting to a rousing noisy climax , and then inexplicably it faltered . Veda struck a petulant chord . " I always want to play it that way . " " " I 'll tell Mr. Rachmaninoff when I see him . " Mr. Hannen was slightly ironical about it , but his brows knit , and he began eyeing Veda sharply . Veda , a little chastened , finished . He made no comment , but got up , found a piece of music , and put it in front of her . " Let 's try the sight-reading . " Veda rattled through this piece like a human pianola , while Mr. Hannen alternately screwed up his face as though he were in great pain , and stared hard at her . When silence mercifully stole into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got out a violin case , set it beside Mildred , opened it , and began to resin the bow . " Let 's try the accompanying . What 's your name again ? " " Miss Pierce . " " Ah  --  ? " " Veda . " " Have you ever accompanied , Veda ? " " Just a little . " " Just a little , what ? " "  --  I beg your pardon ? " " I might warn you , Veda , that with young pupils I mix quite a little general instruction , in with the musical . Now if you do n't want a clip on the ear , you 'll call me sir . " " Yes sir . " Mildred wanted to kick up her heels and laugh at a Veda who was suddenly meek and humble . However , she affected not to be listening , and fingered the silk of Mr. Hannen 's violin cover as though it was the most interesting piece of sewing she had ever seen . He picked up the violin now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there must be something for you to accompany , so it 'll have to do . Sound your A. " p 140 Veda tapped a note , he tuned the violin , and set a piece of music on the piano . " All right  --  a little briskly . Do n't drag it . " Veda looked blankly at the music . " Why  --  you 've given me the violin part . " " Sir . " " Ah , so I have . " He looked on the shelves for a moment , then shook his head . " Well , the piano part 's around somewhere , but I do n't seem to see it at the moment . All right , keep the violin part in front of you and give me a little accompaniment of your own . Let 's see  --  you have four measures before I come in . Count the last one aloud . " " Sir , I would n't even know how to  --  " " Begin . " After a desperate look at the music , Veda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tinkle notes . Then , thumping a heavy bass , she counted : " One , two , three , four and  --  " Even Mildred could detect that the violin was certainly not Mr. Hannen 's instrument . But Veda kept up her bass , and when he stopped , she repeated the long figure , thumped her bass , counted , and he came in again . This went on for a short time , but little by little , Mildred thought , it was getting smoother . Once , when Mr. Hannen stopped , Veda omitted the long figure . In its place , she repeated the last part of the air he had been playing , so that when he came in again it joined up quite neatly . When they finished , Mr. Hannen put the violin away and resumedstaring at Veda . Then : " Where did you study harmony ? " " I never studied harmony , sir . " He walked around a few moments , said " Well " " in a reflective way , and began to talk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a xlyophone that fell in love with a hand organ , but that may respond to  --  whatever we do about it . And the conceit is almost beyond belief . That certainly will respond . It 's responded a little already , has n't it ? " " Yes sir . " " But  --  play that bit in the Rachmaninoff again , the way you said you always wanted to play it . " Rather weakly , Veda obeyed . He was beside her on the bench now , and dropped his big paw on the keys as he played afterp 141 her . A tingle went through Mildred at the way it seemed to reach down into the vitals of the piano , and find sounds that were rich , dark , and exciting . She noted that it no longer seemed hairy and thick , but became a thing of infinite grace . Iie studied the keys a moment , then said : " And suppose you did play it that way . You 'd be in a little trouble , do n't you think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you go from there ? " Veda played a few more chords , and he carefully played them after her . Then he nodded . " Yes , it could have been written that way . I really think Mr. Rachmaninoff 's way is better  --  I find a slight touch of banality in yours , do n't you ? " " What 's banality , sir ? " " I mean it sounds corny . Cheap . It 's got that old Poet and Peasant smell to it . Play it an octave higher and put a couple of trills in it , it would be Listen to the Mocking Bird almost before you knew it . " Veda played it an octave higher , twiddled a trill , did a bar of Listen to the Mocking Bird , and got very red . " Yes sir , I guess you 're right . " " But  --  it makes musical sense . " This seemed so incredible to him that he sat in silence for some little time before he went on : " I got plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything in their heads . Your fingers , Veda , I 'm not so sure about . There 's something about the way you do it that is n't exactly  --  but never mind about that . We 'll see what can be done . But your head  --  that 's different . Your sightreadingis remarkable , the sure sign of a musician . And that trick I played on you , making you improvise an accompaniment to the little gavotte  --  of course , you did n't really do it well , but the amazing thing was that you could do it at all . I do n't know what made me think you could , unless it was that idiotic monkeyshineyou pulled in the Rachmaninoff . So  --  " He turned now to Mildred . " I want her over here twice a week . I 'm giving her one lesson in piano  --  my rate is ten dollars an hour , the lesson is a half hour , so it 'll cost you five dollars . I 'm giving her another lesson in the theory of music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure what will come of it ' , and it is n't fair to make you pay for my experiments . But , she 'll learn something , and at the very least get some of the conceit knocked out of her . " So saying , he took a good healthy wallop at Veda 's ribs . Then he added : " I suppose nothing will come of it , if we 're really honest about it . Many are called , in this business , but few arep 142 chosen , and hardly any find out how good you have to be before you 're any good at all . But  --  we 'll see . . . . God , Veda , but your playing stinks . I ought to charge a hundred dollars an hour , just to listen to you . " " Veda started to cry , as Mildred stared in astonishment . Not three times in her life had she seen this cold child cry , and yet there she was , with two streams squirting out of her eyes and cascading down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Hansen airily waved his hand . " Let her bawl . It 's nothing to what she 'll be doing before I get through with her . " So Veda bawled , and she was still bawling when they got in the car and started home . Mildred kept patting her hand , and gave up all thought of a little light twitting on the subject of " Sir . " Then , in explosive jerks , Veda started to talk . " Oh Mother  --  I was so afraid  --  he would n't take me . And then  --  he wanted me . He said I had something  --  in my head . Mother  --  in my head ! " Then Mildred knew that an awakening had taken place in Veda , that it was n't in the least phony , and that what had awakenedwas precisely what she herself had mutely believed in all these years . It was as though the Star of Bethlehem had suddenlyappeared in front of her . So Monty was vindicated , but when Mildred snuggled up to him one night in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result left a great deal to be desired . He lit a cigarette and rehearsed his reasons for thinking Veda " had it " ; they were excellent reasons , all in praise of Veda , but somehow they did n't hit the spot . When she tried to break through his habit of treating everything with offhand impersonality , saying was n't it wonderful , and how did he ever think up something like that , he seemed uncomfortableat her kittenishness , and rather curtly brushed her off . To hell with it , he said . He had done nothing that anybody could n't have done that knew the child , so why give him any credit ? Then , as though bored with the whole subject , he began strippingoff her stockings . But there was a great hunger in Mildred 's heart : she had to share this miracle with somebody , and when she had stood it as long as she could she sent for Bert . He came the next afternoon , to the restaurant , when the place was deserted and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him about it . He had already heard a little , from Mom , who had got a brief vet-p 143 sion from Veda , but now he got it all , in complete detail . Mildred told about the studio , the Rachmaninoff prelude , the sightreading , the accompaniment to the violin selection . He listened gravely , except for the laugh he let out over the " Sir " episode . When Mildred had finished he thought a long time . Then , solemnly , he announced : " She 's some kid . She 's some kid . " Mildred sighed happily . This was the kind of talk she wanted , at last . He went on , then , flatteringly reminding her that she had always said Veda was " artistic , " gallantly conceding that lie himself had had his doubts . Not that he did n't appreciate Veda , he added hastily , hell no . It was only that he did n't know of any music on Mildred 's side or his , and he always understood this kind of thing ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how any of us can be wrong , and goddam it , he was glad it had turned out this way . Goddam it he was . Then , having polished off the past , he looked at the future . The fingers , he assured Mildred , were nothing to worry about . Because suppose she did n't becomea great pianist ? From all he had heard , that market was shot anyhow . But if it was like this guy said , and she had talent in her head , and began to write music , that was where the real dough was , and it did n't make a hit of difference whether you could play the piano or not . Because , he said dramatically , look at Irving Berlin . He had it straight that the guy could n't play a note , but with a million bucks in the bank and more coming in every day , he should worry whether lie could tickle the keys or not . Oh no , Mildred need n't worry about Veda now . The way it looked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long she 'd be pulling off something big . Having Veda turn into Irving Berlin , with or without a million bucks in the bank , was n't exactly what Mildred had in mind for her . In her imagination she could see Veda already , wearing a pale green dress to set off her coppery hair , seated at a big piano before a thousand people , grandly crossing her right hand over her left , haughtily bowing to thunderous applause  --  but no matter . The spirit was what counted . Bert spun her dreams for her , while she closed her eyes and breathed deeply , and Arline poured him more coffee , from a percolator , the way he liked it . It was the middle of the afternoon before Mildred returned to earth , and said suddenly : " Bert , can I ask a favor ? " " Anything , Mildred . " " It 's not why I asked you here . I just wanted to tell you about it . I knew you 'd want to hear . " p 144 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " I want that piano , at Mom 's . " " Nothing to it . They 'll be only too glad  --  " " No , wait a minute . I do n't want it as a gift , nothing like that at all . I just want to borrow it until I can get Veda a piano that  --  " " It 's all right . They 'll  --  " " No , but wait a minute . I 'm going to get her a piano . But the kind of piano that she ought to have , I mean a real grand , costs eleven hundred dollars . And they 'll give me terms , but I just do n't dare take on any more debt . What I 'm going to do , I 'm going to open a special account , down at the bank , and keep putting in , and I know by next Christmas , I mean a year from now , I can manage it . But just now  --  " " I only wish I could contribute a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Quickly she put her hand over his and patted it . " You 've done plenty . Maybe you 've forgotten how you gave me the house outright , and everything that went before , but I have n't . You 've done your share . Now it 's my turn . I do n't mind about that , but I do want them to know , Mom and Mr. Pierce I mean , that I 'm not trying to get anything from them . I just want to borrow the piano , so Veda can practice at home , and  --  " " Mildred . " " Yes ? " " Will you just kindly shut up ? " " All right . " " Everything 's under control . Just leave it to me . " So presently the piano was carted down , and on January 2 , Mildred went to the bank and deposited $21 , after multiplying carefully , and making sure that $21 a week , at the end of a year , would almost exactly equal $1,100 . Mildred was in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other alarums that attended Mr. Roosevelt 's inauguration , that she paid scant attention to anything except her immediate concerns . But when her apprehension slacked off , she began to notice that Monty seemed moody and abstracted , with little of the flippancy that was normally part of him . Then , in a speakeasy one night , the sharp way he glanced at the check told her he did n't have much money with him . Then another night , when he revoked an order for a drink he obviously wanted , she knew he was hard up . But it was Veda who let the cat out of the bag. p 145 Walking home from the restaurant one night , she suddenly asked Mildred : " Heard the news ? " " What news , darling ? " " The House of Beragon is ge-finished . It is ffft , fa-down-goboom , oop-a-doop-whango . Alas it is no more . Pop goes the weasel . " " I 've been suspecting something like that . " Mildred said this quickly , to cover the fact that she actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the walk home was depressed by the realization that Monty had suffered some sort of fantastic reverses without saying a word to her . But soon curiosity got the better of her . She lit a fire in the den , had Veda sit down , and asked for more details . " Well , Mother , I really do n't know a great deal about it , except that it 's all over Pasadena , and you hardly hear anything else . They had some stock , the Duenna , that 's his mother , and the Infanta , that 's his sister . Stock in a bank , somewhere in the East . And it was assessable , whateverthat means . So when the bank did n't open it was most unfortunate . What is assessable ? " " I heard some talk about it , when the banks were closed . I think it means that if there 's not enough money to pay the depositors , then the stockholders have to make it good . " " That 's it . That explains about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia , the Duenna and the Infanta , so papers ca n't be served on them . And of course when Beragon Brothers , dear old Beragon Brothers , founded in 1893  --  when they went bust , that did n't help any , either . " " When did that happen ? " " Three or four months ago . Their growers , the farmers that raised the fruit , all signed up with the Exchange , and that was what cooked Monty 's goose . He did n't have any hank stock . His money was in the fruit company , but when that folded his mother kicked in . Then when the bank went under she had nothing to kick . Anyway there 's a big sign on the lawn , For Sale , Owner Must Sacrifice , ' and Monty 's showing the prospective buyers around . " " You mean their house ? " " I mean their palatial residence on Orange Grove Avenue , with the iron dogs out front and the peacock out behind  --  but a buyer had better show up pretty soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly looks as though the old buzzard will have to go to work . " p 146 Mildred did n't know whether she was more shocked at the tale she heard or Veda 's complete callousness about it . But one thing was clear : Monty wanted no sympathy from her , so for a time she ate with him , drank with him , and slept with him under the pretense that she knew nothing whatever . But presently the thing became so public , what with pieces in the paper about the sale of his polo ponies , the disappearance of the Cord in favor of a battered little Chevrolet , and one thing and another , that he did begin to talk about it . But he always acted as though this were some casual thing that would be settled shortly , a nuisance while it lasted , but of no real importance . Never once did he let Mildred come close to him in connection with it , pat him on the head , tell him it did n't really matter , do any of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do under these circumstances . She felt sorry for him , terribly upset about him . And yet she also felt snubbed and rebuffed . And she could never shake off the feeling that if he accepted her as his social equal he would act differently about it . And then one night she came home to find him with Veda , waiting for her . They were in the den , having a furious argument about polo , which continued after she sat down . It seemed that a new team had been organized , called the Ramblers ; that its first game would be at San Diego , and that Monty had been invited to make the trip . Veda , an expert on such matters , was urging him to go . " There 'd better be one eight-goal man with that outfit , or they can stop calling it The Ramblers and call it Mussolini Reviewing the Cavalry , because that 's what it 's going to be all right . Just a one-way parade of horses , and they wo n't wake up until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got too much to do . " " " Such as what ? " " This and that . " " Nothing whatever , if I 'm any good at guessing . Monty , you 've got to go with them . If you do n't , they 're sunk . It 'll be embarrassing . And they 'll simply ruin your horses . After all , they 've got some rights . " Polo was a complete mystery to Mildred . How Monty could sell his ponies and still be riding them she could n't understand , and chiefly she could n't understand why he was riding them , or anybody was . And yet it tore her heart that he should want to go , and not be able to , and it kept bothering her long after Vedap 147 had gone to bed . When he got up to go she pulled him down beside her , and asked : " Do you need money ? " " Oh Lord no ! " His voice , look , and gesture were those of a man pained beyondexpression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years in the restaurant business , was not fooled . She said : " I think you do . " " Mildred  --  you leave me without any idea  --  what to say to you . I 've  --  run into a little bad luck  --  that 's true . My mother has  --  we all have . But  --  it 's nothing that involves  --  small amounts . I can still  --  hold up my end of it  --  if that 's what you 're talking about . " " I want you to play in that game . " " I 'm not interested . " " Wait a minute . " She found her handbag , took out a crisp $20 bill . Going over to him she slipped it in the breast pocket of his coat . He took it out , with an annoyed grimace , and pitched it back at her . It fell on the floor . She picked it up and dropped it in his lap . With the same annoyed grimace , very much annoyed this time , he picked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then hesitated , and sat there snapping it between his fingers , so it made little pistol shots . Then , without looking at her : " Well  --  I 'll pay it hack . " " That 's all right . " " I do n't know when  --  two or three things have to be straightenedout first  --  but it wo n't be very long . So  --  if it 's understood to he distinctly a loan  --  " " Any way you want . " That week , with the warm June weather , her business took a sharp drop . For the first time , she had to skip an installment on Veda 's piano . The next week , when he changed his mind about going to a speakeasy that he liked , she slipped $10 into his pocket , and they went . Before she knew it , she was slipping him $10 's and $20 's regularly , either when she remembered about it , or he stammeringlyasked her if he could tap her for another small loan . Her business continued light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to make only three deposits on the piano , despite hard scrimping . She was appalled at the amount of money he cost , and fought off a rising irritation about it . She told herself it was n't his fault , that he was merely going through what thou-p 148 sands of others had already gone through , were still going through . She told herself it was her duty to be helping somebody , and that it might as well be somebody that meant something to her . She also reminded herself she had practically forced the arrangement on him . It was no use . The piano had become an obsession with her by now , and the possibility that it was slipping away from her caused a baffled , frustrated sensation that almost smothered her . And she was all too human , and the cuts she had received from him demanded their revenge . She began to order him around : timid requests that he haul Veda to Mr. Hannen 's , so she would n't have to take the bus , now became commands ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he was to be back , whether he was to have his dinner at the restaurant or at the house , and when she would join him afterwards . In a hundredsmall ways she betrayed that she despised him for taking her money , and on his side , he did little to make things better . Monty , alas , was like Bert . A catastrophic change had taken place in his life , and he was wholly unable to adjust himself to it . In some way , indeed , he was worse off than Bert , for Bert lived with his dreams , and at least they kept him mellow . But Monty was an amateur cynic , and cynics are too cynical to dream . He had been born to a way of life that included taste , manners , and a jaunty aloofness from money , as though it were beneath a gentleman 's notice . But what he did n't realize was that all these things rested squarely on money : it was the possession of money that enabled him to be aloof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated to play , play on which the newspapers cast a certain agreeable importance , but play nevertheless . Now , with the money gone , he was unable to give up the old way of life , or find a new one . He became a jumble of sorry fictions , an attitude with nothing behind it but pretense . He retained something that he thought of as his pride , but it had no meaning , and exhibited itself mainly in mounting bitterness toward Mildred . He carped at her constantly , sneered at her loyalty to Mr. Roosevelt , revealedthat his mother knew the whole Roosevelt family , and regarded Franklin Delano as a phony and a joke . His gags about the Pie Wagon , once easily patronizing and occasionally funny , took on a touch of malice , and Veda , ever fashionable , topped them with downright insolence . The gay little trio was n't quite so gay . And then one night in the den , when Mildred tucked another $20 into his pocket , he omitted his usual mumble about payingp 149 It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched his forelock with it , and said : " Your paid gigolo thanks you . " " I do n't think that was very nice . " " " It 's true , is n't it ? " " Is that the only reason you come here ? " " Not at all . Come what may , swing high , swing low , for better or for worse , you 're still the best piece of tail I ever had , or ever could imagine . " He got this off with a nervous , rasping little laugh , and for a few seconds Mildred felt prickly all over , as though the blood were leaving her body . Then her face felt hot , and she became aware of a throbbing silence that had fallen between them . Sheer pride demanded that she say something , and yet for a time she could n't . Then , in a low , shaking voice , she said : " Monty , suppose you go home . " " What 's the matter ? " " I think you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know ! " " I told you to go . " Instead of going , he shook his head , as though she were incrediblyobtuse , and launched into a dissertation on the relations between the sexes . The sense of it was that as long as this thing was there , everything was all right ; that it was the strongest bond there was , and what he was really doing , if she only had sense enough to know it , was paying her a compliment . What she really objected to was his language , was n't it ? If he had said it flowery , so it sounded poetic , she would have felt differently , would n't she ? But every moment or two he gave the same nervous , rasping laugh , and again she was unable to speak . Then , gathering herself with an effort , she rose to one of her rare moments of eloquence . " If you told me that , and intended it as a compliment , it might have been one , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; t1 it . But when you tell me that , and it 's the only thing you have to tell me , then it 's not a compliment . It 's the worst thing I ever had said to me in my life . " " Oh , so you want the I-love-you scene . " " I want you to go . " Hot tears started to her eyes , but she winked them back . He shook his head , got up , then turned to her as though he had to explain something to a child . " We 're not talking about things . We 're talking about words . I 'm not a poet . I do n't even want top 150 be a poet . To me , that 's just funny . I say something to you my own way , and wham you go moral on me . Well what do I do now ? It 's a pure question of prudery , and  --  " " That 's a lie . " Her lungs were filling with breath now , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face screwed up into the squint , and the glittering tears made her eyes look hard , cold , and feline . She sat perfectly still , her legs crossed , and looked at him , where he stood facing her on the other side of the room  --  After a long pause she went on , in a passionate , trembling voice . " Since you 've known me , that 's what I 've been to you , a piece of tail . You 've taken me to mountain shacks and back-street speakeasies , you 've never introducedme to your friends  --  except for a few men you 've brought over to dinner sometimes  --  or your mother , or your sister , or any member of your family . You 're ashamed of me , and now that you 're in my debt , you had to say what you just said to me , to get even . It 's not a surprise to me . I 've known it all along . Now you can go . " " None of that is true . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far as my friends go  --  " " They mean nothing to me. " "  --  It had n't occurred to me you 'd care to meet any of them . Most of them are dull , but if meeting them means anything to you , that 's easy fixed . So far as my mother goes  --  " " She means nothing to me either . " "  --  So far as my mother goes , I ca n't do anything about her now , because she 's away , and so is my sister . But you may have forgotten that with this restaurant of yours you keep somewhat peculiar hours . To have arranged a meeting would have been idiotically complicated , so I did the best I could . I took your daughter over there , and if you knew anything about social conventionsat all , you 'd know that I was dealing in my own way with what otherwise would have been a situation . And certainly my mother took all the interest in Veda she could be expected to take  --  a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . " "  --  I did n't complain on that score . " In her heart , Mildred knew that Monty was being as dishonest about Veda as he was being about the rest of it . Obviously , he liked Veda , and found her an amusing exhibit to drag around , no doubt because she was precisely the kind of snob that he was himself , and that most of his friends were . And also , by doing so much for the child , he could neatly sidestep the necessity of doing anything about the mother . But to argue about it would jeopardize the enchanted life that Veda now led , so Mildred veered off in a new direction . " Monty , why do n't you tell the truth ? You look down on me because I work . " " Are you crazy ? " " No . You look down on everybody that works , as you practicallyadmitted to me the first night I was with you . All right , I work . It 's not at all elegant work , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook food and sell it . But one thing you 'd better get through your head sooner or later : You 'll have to go to work  --  " " Of course I 'm going to work ! " " Ha-ha . When ? " " As soon as I get the damned house sold , and this mess straightened out that we 've got ourselves into . Until that 's over , work , for me , is out of the question . But as soon as it 's over  --  " " Monty , you just make me laugh . I used to be married to a real-estate company , and there 's no use trying to kid me about houses , and how to get rid of taem . There 's nothing about that place that ca n't be put in the hands of an agent , and handled like any other . No , it 's not that . You 'd rather live then. , so you can have an address on Orange Grove Avenue , and cook your own eggs in the morning , and drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dinner here with Veda , and take your spending money from me  --  than work . That 's all , is n't it ? " " Sure . " His face broke into a sunny smile , he came over , roughly pushed her into a little heap , took her in his arms . " I do n't know anybody I 'd rather take money from than you . Your paid gigolo is damned well satisfied . " She pushed his arms away , trying to repulse him . But she was taken by surprise , and her struggles had no steam in them . Try as she would , she could n't resist the physical effect he had on her , and when she finally yielded , the next hour was more wanton , more shamefully exciting , than any she remembered . And yet , for the first time , she felt an undertone of disgust . She did n't forget that not once had the $20 bill been mentioned , not once had he offered to give it back . They parted amicably , he apologizing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had said , as she was upset , and did n't mean it . But both of them meant it , and neither of them forgot.  |p152BaBY  , WHAT are you doing . about Repeal ? " " You mean Repeal of Prohibition ? " " Yeah , just that . " " Why , I do n't see how it affects me . " " It affects you plenty . Mrs. Gessler , having coffee with Mildred just before closing time , began to talk very rapidly . Repeal , she said , was only a matter of weeks , and it was going to stand the whole restaurant business on its head . " People are just crazy for a drink , a decent drink , a drink with no smoke or ether or formaldehyde in it , a drink they can have out in the open , without having to give the password to some yegg with his face in a slot . And places that can read the handwriting on the wall are going to cash in , and those that ca n't are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade here , do n't you ? And you think it 'll stick by you , because  it likes you , and likes your chicken , and wants to help a plucky little woman get along ? It will like hell . When they find out you 're not going to serve them that drink , they 're going to be sore and stay sore . They 're going to tag you for a back numberand go some place where they get what they want . You 're going to be out of luck . " " You mean I should sell liquor ? " " It 'll be legal , wo n't it ? " " I wouldnt even consider such a thing . " " Why not ? " " Do you think I 'd run a saloon ? " Mrs. Gessler lit a cigarette , began snapping the ashes impatientlyinto Mildred 's Mexican ashtrays . Then she took Mildred to task for prejudice , for stupidity , for not being up with the times . Mildred , annoyed at being told how to run her business , argued back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two points . She kept reminding Mildred that liquor , when it came back , was n't going to be the same as it had been in the old days . It was going to be respectable , and it was going to put the res-p 153 taurant business on its feet . " That 's what has ailed eating houses ever since the war . That 's why you 're lucky to get a lousy 85 cents for your dinner , when if you could sell a drink with it , you could get a buck , and maybe a buck and a quarter . Baby , you 're not talking sense , and I 'm getting damned annoyed at you . " " But I do n't know anything about liquor . " " I do . " Something about Mrs. Gessler 's manner suggested that this was what she had been trying to lead up to all the time , for she lit another cigarette , eyed Mildred sharply , and went on : " Now listen : You know and I know and we all know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just the same , Repeal 's going to hit him hard . We 'll have to do something , quick , while he reorganizes . That means I 'll have to do something . So how 's this ? You put in the booze , and I 'll take charge of it for you , for a straight ten per cent . of what I take in , plus tips , if , as , and when there are any , and if , as and when I 'm not to proud to pick them up  --  which ai n't likely , Baby . It ai n't even possible . " " You ? A bartender ? " " Why not ? I 'll be a damned good one . " This struck Mildred so funny that she laughed until she heard a girdle seam pop . In spite of work , worry , and everything she could do about it , she was getting the least little bit fat . But Mrs. Gessler did n't laugh . She was in dead earnest , and for the next few days nagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd , but on her trips downtown in connection with the pie business , she began to hear things . And then , as state after state fell in line for Repeal , she hardly heard anything else : every proprietor , from Mr. Chris to the owners of the big cafeterias , was in a dither to know what to do , and she began to get frightened . She had to talk to somebody , and on such matters she had n't much confidence in Bert , and none at all in Monty . On a sudden inspiration she called up Wally . She saw him quite a lot , in connection with their real-estate relations , but their previous relation , by the curious twists of human memory , had by tacit consent been completely erased , so it had never existed . Wally came over one afternoon , listened while Mildred explained her quandary , then shook his head . " Well I do n't know what you 're backing and filling about . Course you 'll sell liquor . " " You mean I 'll have to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dough in it . " He looked at her with his familiar stare , that was at the samep 154 time so vague and so shrewd , and her heart gave a little thump . It was the first time , for some reason , that this aspect of the problem had occurred to her . He went on , a little annoyed at her stupidity : " What the hell ? Every drink you sell will be about eighty per cent profit , even at what you have to pay for your liquor . And it 'll pull in more people for the dinner trade . If Lucy Gessler wants to take it over , then O.K. If she do n't know about booze , I do n't know who does . Get going on it , and get going now . It 's coming , fast . And be sure you put on your sign , Cocktails . That 's what they 're waiting for . Put a red star in front of it , so they know you know it 's important . " " Will I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll fix that up for you . " So the next time Mrs. Gessler came in , she found Mildred in a different frame of mind . She nodded approval of what Wally had said about the sign , then became coldly businesslike about other obligatory preparations . " 1 ' 11 need a bar , but there 's no room for one until you make alterations , so I 'll have to get along with a portable . It 'll be a perambular thing that I 'll wheel from table to table  --  the same as most other places are going to use , temporarily . It 'll have to be specially made and it 'll cost you about three hundred bucks . Then I 'll need a couple of hundred dollars ' worth of liquor . I ought to have more , but it 'll be all I can get , in the beginning . Then I want a couple of leather seats , near the door , with a low table between . Between trips to the tables , I 'll be running my own little soiree over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people waiting to be seated for dinner . Then I 'll want a special bus , assigned to me alone . Your kid Pancho has a pal that 'll do , by the name of Josie . He wo n't be available for general work , because he 'll have to wash glasses for me all the time , and wash them the way I want them washed , and bring beer from the icebox when I call for it , and ice whatever wine we sell , and he 'll have all he can do , just helping me . Then I 'll need a full set of cocktail , highball , and wine glasses  --  not too many , but we 'll have to have the right glasses for the right drinks . Then , let 's see . You 'll need pads of special bar checks , to run separate from the others . It 's the only way we can keep it all straight . That 's about all I can think of now . " " How much , all in all ? " " About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , furniture and checks . The liquor will be over and above the five hundred , but you wo n't pay till the Monday after delivery , and by that time we ought to have a few dollars coming in . " Mildred gulped , told Mrs. Gessler she would let her know next day . That night she lay awake , and her mind darted first to this scheme , then to that , whereby she could furnish five hundred dollars . She kept a little reserve of two or three hundred dollars , but she dared not dip into it , as sad experience had taught her that emergencies arose constantly that demanded instant cash . It was a long time before her mind darted at last to the only way she could get the money : by robbing the special account for Veda 's piano . It now amounted to $567 , and the moment she thought of it she tried not to think of it , and began once more her frantic questing for schemes . But soon she knew this was what she had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas . Then once more rage began to suffocate her  --  not at Mrs. Gessler , or Repeal , or any of the circumstances that made this new outlay necessary , but at Monty , for the money he had cost her , those endless $1O 's and $20 's which now , if she had them , would see her through . She worked herself into such a state that presently she had to get up , put on a kimono , and make herself a cup of tea , so she could quiet doom . Christmas morning Mildred woke up with one of her rare hangovers . It had indeed been a gay night at the little restaurant , for the bar , opening promptly on December 6 , had outdone all that had been expected of it . Not only had it taken in large sums itself , but it had drawn a bigger dinner trade , and a better dinnertrade . Mrs. Gessler , in gabardine slacks of the same brickredas the waitresses ' uniforms , white mess jacket with brass buttons , and red ribbon around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and certainly she was expert enough to please the most fastidious . Tips went up , and when the kitchen celebration finally got going , it was exceedingly festive . Hans , the baker , was supposed to be off at night , but he showed up anyway , and got the party started with a bang by feeling Sigrid 's leg . Sigrid was a Swedish girl Mildred had hired mainly for her looks , and then found out was one of the best waitresses she had ever seen . Then , just to be impartial , Hans felt Arline 's leg , and Emma 's , ; and Audrey 's . Emma and Audrey had been taken on the day after the opening , just to forestall the possibility of another jam-up . The ensuing squeals were enjoyed by Rancho and Josie , who satp 156 apart , not quite of things , yet not quite out of them ; and by Mrs. Kramer , an assistant cook Mildred was training . They were emphaticallynot enjoyed by Carl , a seventeen-year-old who drove the little second-hand delivery truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mildred Pierce , Pies , " lettered on it in bold red script . He concentrated on ice cream and cake , and eyed Hans 's efforts with stony disapproval , to the great delight of Arline , who kept screaming that he was learning " the facks of life . " Mildred had sat down with them , and put out wine and whiskey , and taken two or three drinks herself . What with the liquor , and the thanks she received for the $10 she had given each of them , she began to feel so friendly that she weakened in her resolve to give Monty nothing whatever for Christmas . First she took his orchids out of the icebox and . pinned them on , to a loud chorus of applause . Then she had another drink , went over to the cash box , and smooched four $10 bills . These she put in a little envelope and wrote on it , " Merry Christmas , Monty . " Then , hearing from Mrs. Gessler that he had arrived , she went into the dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the trees she slipped the envelope into his pocket and thanked him for the orchids , which she said were the most beautifulshe had ever had . Then she invited him to smell them . Laughing a little , obviously delighted at her condition , he remindedher that orchids had no smell . " Smeh 'm anyway . " So he smelled , and reported that the orchids still had no smell , but that she smelled fine . She nodded , satisfied , and kissed him . Then she took him inside , where Bert , Wally , Mrs. Gessler , and Veda were sitting at a table , having a little celebration of their own . And yet the evening had had an unpleasant finish : Monty and Veda began whispering together , and went into gales of laughter at some joke of their own . Mildred heard the words " varlets ' yulabaloo , " and concluded , probably correctly , that they were laughing at the party in the kitchen . She launched into a long , boozy harangue on the rights of labor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anybody else . Wally tried to shush her down and Mrs. Gessler tried to shush her down , but it was no use . She went on to the bitter end . Then , somewhat inconsistently , she lurched to her feet , went to the kitchen , and asked how people could enjoy themselves with all that yelling going on . This had the effect of ringing down the curtain , front and rear p 157 Now , as she got up and dressed , she had a sour recollection of the harangue , and a still sourer recollection of the four $10 's that had followed their predecessors down a bottomless rathole . She had given betty the day off , so she went to the kitchen , made herself coffee , and drank it black . Then , hearing Veda 's water running , she knew she had to hurry . She went to her bedroom , got a pile of packages out of the closet , and took them to the living room . Quickly she arranged a neat display around the base of the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she took out her own offering and looked at it . It was a wrist watch . She had put off buying it until the last moment , hoping the profits from the bar would permit her to order the piano anyway . But the unforeseen had again intervened . During the first hectic days of Repeal , Mrs. Gessler had a devil 's own time finding liquor , and for much of it had to pay cash . So the hope died , and at the last minute Mildred had dashed downtown and bought this gaud for $75 . She listened close and heard its tiny tick , but it did n't sound much like a grand piano . Glumly she wrapped it , wrote a little card , tucked it under the ribbon . Then she set it beside the package from Bert . She had hardly stood up to survey the general effect when there came a tap on the door , and Veda , in her most syrupy Christmas voice , asked : " May I come in ? " Mildred managed a soft smile , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses , wishing a merry Christmas to you darling , darling Mother ! " Then , just as suddenly , the kisses stopped and so did the greetings . Veda was staring at the Pierce upright , and by the look on her face Mildred knew she had been told about the grand , by Bert , by Monty , by the cashier at the bank , by somebody  --  and had expected to see it there , as a fine surprise , this Christmas morning . Mildred licked her lips , opened her mouth to make explanations , but at the cold look on Veda 's face , she could n't . Nervously she said something about there being a great many presents , and had n't Veda better make a list , so she would be sure who sent what ? Veda made no reply , but stooped down and began pulling ribbons . When she got to the wrist watch she examined it with casual interest , laid it aside without comment . At this Mildred went back to her bedroom , lay down on the bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presently the bell rang , and she heard Bert 's voice . Going to the living room again , she was in time to hear Veda ecstatically thank him for the riding bootsp 160 Mildred had sat down , but at these last words she looked up . She was wholly familiar with Veda 's vocabulary , and she knew that this phrase was not part of it . At her question , Veda came over , leaned down close . " Why you poor goddam sap  --  do you think he 'd marry you ? " " If I were willing , yes . " " Oh ! Yee gods and little fishes hear my cynical laughter , from Pagliacci , by Ruggiero Leoncavallo , eighteen fifty-eight-nineteen nineteen . If you were willing  --  ! Pardon me while I regain my shattered composure . Stupid , do n't you know what he sees in you ? " " About what you see , I think . " " No  --  it 's your legs . " " He  --  told you  --  that ? " " Why certainly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of course he told me . We 're very good friends , and I hope I have a mature point of view on these matters . Really , he speaks very nicely about your legs . He has a theory about them . He says a gingham apron is the greatest provocation ever invented by woman for the torture of man , and that the very best legs are found in kitchens , not in drawing rooms . Never take the mistress if you can get the maid , ' is the way he puts it . And another thing , he says a pretty varlet is always agreeably grateful , and not too exacting , with foolish notions about matrimony and other tiresome things . I must say I find his social theories quite fasci-nating . " Veda went on at some length , snapping her cigarette and when it went out lighting another one and throwing the match on the floor . But for some time Mildred found her taunts nothing but a jumble . She was so stunned at the discovery that this man , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , had all the time been sneering at her behind her back , making fun of her most intimate relations with him , setting the child against her , that every part of her seemed to have turned to jelly . Presently , however , words began to have meaning again , and she heard Veda saying : " After all , Mother , even in his darkest days , Monty 's shoes are custom made . " " They ought to be . They cost me enough . " Mildred snapped this out bitterly , and for a second wished she had n't . But the cigarette , suddenly still in mid-air , told her it was news to Veda , quite horrible news , and without further regretsp161she rammed home her advantage : " You did n't know that , did you ? " Veda stared incredulously , then decided to play it funny . " You buy his shoes ? Yee gods and little  --  " " His shoes and his shirts and his drinks and everything else he 's had in the last few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call on your gods and little fishes any more , or mentionany more dates from the operas . If you want to see some dates I have them all written down , with an exact amount beside each one . Miss Pierce , you made a slight mistake . It 's not my legs that he likes me for , it 's my money . And so long as it 's that , we 'll see who 's the varlet and who 's the boss . It may interest you to know that that 's why he 's such a very good friend of yours . He does n't haul you over to your music lesson because he wants to . In fact , he often complains about it . He does it because he has to . And surprising though it be to you , he 'll marry me , or not marry me , or do anything I say , so his proud , gentlemanly belly can have something to eat . " Mildred got up , something haughty in her manner for a momentsuggesting Veda . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you see , is n't it ? And unfortunately , you 're in exactly the position he 's in , too . You have to do what I say . The hand that holds the money cracks the whip . And I say there 'll be no more money for you , not one cent , until you take back everything you 've said , and apologize for it . " Veda 's answer was to abandon the grand manner , and become a yelling , devilish adolescent of fourteen . Coldly , Mildred listened to her curses , watched her kick at the Pierce upright with Bert 's riding boots . " And that 's the piano you 're going to practiceon , until I get ready , in my own good time , to buy you another . " Veda screamed at the top of her lungs , then leaped at the piano and began playing the Can-Can from Orpheus . Mildred did n't know what it was , but she knew it was wild , obscene music . Picking up her coat , she stalked out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far as Monty was concerned , Mildred knew this was the end , but she did n't do anything about it at once . She received him as usual when he dropped in at the restaurant that night , and the next two or three nights . She even submitted to his embraces , deriving a curious satisfaction from the knowledgep 162 that his access to the very best legs was rapidly drawing to a close . Stoppage of the spending money brought Veda to her milk , as no beating had ever done , and when it did , Mildred forgaveher quite honestly , in a teary little scene two or three days after Christmas . It was almost automatic with her by now to acquit Veda of wrongdoing , no matter how flagrant the offense . In her mind , the blame was all Monty 's , and presently she knew exactly how she would deal with him , and when . It would be at the New Year 's party lie had invited her to , a week or so before . " I thought I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might like them . We could meet at my house around ten , have a drink , then go in to the Biltmore , for the noisy part . " This had obviously been an effort to kill two birds with one stone , to give some plausibility to what he had said about hex hours , and at the same time introduce her to somebody , quite as though he would have done so all along if only the right kind of evening had presented itself . She had taken it as evidence of a change of heart , and accepted . Indeed , she had more than accepted . She had consulted anxiously with Mrs. Gessler over what she should wear , and gone into Bullock 's and picked out an evening gown . Then she had gone into a veritable agony over the question of a coat . She did n't have a fur coat , and the prospect of making her debut in the world of mink with nothing but her battered blue haunted her horribly . But Mrs. Gessler , as usual , stepped into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a brocade coat . " It 's a beautiful thing , Baby , ashy rose , all crusted with gold , just what you want with your hair . It 's really a Chinese mandarin 's coat , but it 's been re-cut , and you could n't put a price on it . There 's nothing like it on sale anywhere . It 'll be the snappiestthing in the room , even at the llJtmore , and  --  she 's broke . She needs the money . I 'll see what I can do . " So for $25 , Mildred got the coat , and when the dress arrived , she caught her breath at the total effect . The dress was light blue , and gave something to the rose of the coat , so she was a-shimmer with the delicate colors that her general colorlessness needed . She bought gold stockings and gold shoes , and her panic changed to smug complacency . All this had been before Christmas , and her choice of the New Year 's party as the occasion for the break with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to let such a costume go to waste , as well as a vivid recollection of the $40 she had contributed to the expense . however , no such motive obtruded onp 163 her own virtuous consciousness . It was merely , she told herself ; that a resolve had to be made , and New Year 's morning was a very good time to make it . As she rehearsed the scene mentally , it became clear in its details , and she knew exactly how she would play it . At the Biltmore , she would be gay , and rattle her rattle , and throw her balloon , and tell the story of Harry Engel and the anchors . Back at Monty 's house , she would watch the Ewings take their departure , and then , at his invitation to come in , she would decline , and climb into her car . Then , at his surprisedlook , she would make a little speech . She would say nothing of Veda , or money , or legs . She would merely remark that all things had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though he and she had reached that point . It had been very pleasant , she had enjoyed his company , every minute of it , she wished him the very best in the world , and she certainly hoped he would regard her as his friend . But  --  and at this point she saw herself putting out a graceful hand , and in case he merely stood there looking at it , as stepping on the starter . The whole thing , perhaps , was a little stuffy , and certainly it was sing-songy as she kept adding to it . But it was her valedictory , and no doubt her privilege to deliver it any way she chose . December 31 , 1933 , dawned dark in California , and before the morning was over , quite a little rani was falling . By mid-afternoon , tall tales interrupted the broadcasts : of washouts in the hills , of whole families evacuated from this village and that village , of roads blocked , of trains held in Arizona pending dispatcher'sorders . But in Glendale , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the streets , nothing ominous met the eye , and Mildred viewed the downpour as an annoyance , a damper on business , but nothing to get excited about . Around five o'clock , when it did n't let up , she stopped Mrs. Kramer from sectioning more chickens , on the ground that nobody would be there to eat them , and they could wait until next day . When Arline , Emma , and Audrey successively called up to say they could n't get there , she thought little of it , and when Sigrid came , she set her to cleaning silver . Around six , Monty called up to know if she had cold feet . Laughing , she asked : " What from ? " " Well , it 's a little wet . " " Do you mean you 're getting cold feet ? " " No , not at all . Just being the perfect host and giving you one last chance to back out if you want to . " p 164 " Why , this little shower is nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Around ten . " By seven thirty not one customer had showed tip , and Mrs. Gessler abruptly suggested that they close , and begin getting Mildred dressed , if she was still fool enough to go to the damned party . Mildred agreed , and started her preparations to lock up . Then she , Mrs. Gessler , Mrs. Kramer , Pancho , Josie , and Sigrid all burst out laughing at the discovery that there were no preparations  --  nodishes to wash , no bottles to put out , no cash to count . Mildred simply cut the lights and locked the door , and as the others went scuttling off into the night , she and Mrs. Gessler climbed into her car and drove down Pierce Drive . It was a little windswept , a little rough from the stones that had washed down on it , but otherwise as usual . Mildred parked close by the kitchen door and dived inside , then held out her hand to Mrs. Gessler . She was surprised to find Letty and Veda there . Letty had been afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could spend the night . Veda , due long ago at the Hannens ' for dinner , a party , and an overnight visit , said Mrs. Hannen had called to say the party had been postponed . At this , Mrs. Gessler looked sharply at Mildred , and Mildred went calmly to her room and began taking off her - uniform . By nine , Mildred was powdered , puffed , perfumed , and patted to that state of semi-transparency that a woman seems to achieve when she is really dressed to go out . Her hair , waved the day before , was fluffed out softly ; her dress adjusted to the last fold and flounce ; her face fashioned to the fish-eyed look that marks the last stage of such rites . Letty was entranced , and even Veda admitted that " you really look quite nice , Mother . " Mildred stood before the full-length mirror for a final critical inspection , but Mrs. Gessler disappeared for a final look at the night . When she came back she camped on the bed , and looked moodily at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after taking all that trouble over you , but I would n't go to that party , if I were you . " " Why , for heaven 's sake ? " " Because it 's bad out there . You call that idiot up and tell him you 're not coming . " " Ca n't . " " Oh he 'll understand . He 'll be relieved . " " His phone 's disconnected. " p 165 " It would be . Then send him a wire . It wo n't be delivered till tomorrow , but it 'll prove you got manners . " " I 'm going . " " Baby , you ca n't . " " I said I 'm going . " Irritated , Mrs. Gessler ordered Veda to get the trench coat she wore to school , and her galoshes . Mildred protested , but when Veda appeared with the things , Mrs. Gessler went to work . She pinned Mildred 's dress up , so it was a sort of sash around her hips , with a foot of white slip showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold shoes . Then she put on the evening coat , and pulled the trench coat over it . Then she found a kerchief , and bound it tightly around Mildred 's head . Mildred , suddenly transformed into something that looked like Topsy , sweetly said good-bye to them all . Then she went to the kitchen door , reached out into the wet , and pulled open the car door . Then she hopped in . Then she started the motor . Then she started the wiper . Then she tucked the robe around her . Then , waving gaily to the three anxious faces at the door , she started the car , and went backing down to the street . Turning into Colorado Boulevard , she laughed . Snug in her two coats , with the motor humming smoothly and the wiper chattering cheerfully against the glass , she thought it funny that people should get so excited over a little rain . Heading down into Eagle Rock , she was halted by two men with lanterns . One of them came over , and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You ca n't get through . Not without you detour . " " Well ? Which way do I go ? " He took off his hat , swooshed the water out of it , then quickly put it on again and gave intricate directions as to how she was to drive up to the hills , then turn and follow along the higher ground until she came to Colorado Boulevard again . " That is , if you do n't hit washouts . But believe me , lady , unless you got to get there tonight , it 'll be a whole lot better to turn back . " Mildred , perfectly familiar with the road , took up her journey again . She came to a washout , where part of the hill had slid down on the road , but one track was still open , and she slipped easily by . She came back to Colorado Boulevard at a point not far from the high bridge , so popular with suicides at the time , p 166 and went splashing across . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except for a few tree limbs that had blown down on it , and a lot of leaves , it was clear . As she rolled over its shining black expanse , she laughed again at the way people got all worked up over nothing . On the portico of the Beragon mansion a light was lit . She turned in through the pillars and followed the drive up past the big trees , the iron dogs , and the marble urn . She parked at the steps , and had hardly cut the motor when Monty popped out of the door , in a dinner coat , and stared as though he could hardly , believe his eyes . Then he yelled something at her , popped in the house again , and emerged , carrying a big doorman 's umbrellawith one hand and dragging a gigantic tarpaulin with the other . The tarpaulin lie hurriedly threw over her hood to keep the rain out of the motor . The umbrella he opened for her , and as she made a nimble jump for the portico , said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It did n't even enter my mind . " " You put the light on , and got all dressed up . If you do n't look out I 'll begin wondering who you were expecting . " ' " All that was before I turned on the radio and heard what it 's really like out there . How in the hell did you get here anyway ? For the last hour it 's been nothing but a story of bridges out , roads blocked , whole towns under water , and yet  --  here you are . " Do n't believe everything you hear . " Inside , Mildred saw the reason for the tarpaulin he had producedso unexpectedly , quite as though he kept such things around in case they were needed . The whole place was under gray , ghostly cloths that covered rugs , furniture , even paintings . She shivered as she looked into the great dark drawing room , and he laughed . " Pretty gloomy , hey ? Not quite so bad upstairs . " He led the way up the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she had passed , through several big bedrooms , all under cloths as the drawing room was , to a long narrow hall , at the end of which was the tiny apartment where he lived . " This is my humble abode . How do you like it ? " " Why it 's  --  quite nice . " Really servants ' quarters , but I moved into them because I could have a little fire  --  and they seemed cozier , somehow . " The furnishings had the small , battered , hand-me-down look of servants ' quarters , but the fire was friendly . Mildred sat downp 167 in front of it and slipped off the galoshes . Then she took off the kerchief and trench coat , and unpinned her dress . His face lit up as she emerged like a butterfly from her very drab cocoon , and he turned her around , examining every detail of her costume . Then he kissed her . For a moment he had the old sunny look , and she had to concentrate hard to remember her grievances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was afraid that with a drink she could n't remember any grievances at all , and asked if they had n't better wait until the Ewings got there . " The  --  who did you say ? " " Is n't that their name ? " " Good God , they ca n't get here . " " Why not ? " " They live on the other side of Huntington Avenue , and it 's three feet deep in water , and  --  how in the hell did you get here ? Have n't you heard there 's a storm going on ? I think you were hiding two blocks up the street , and just pretended to drive over from Glendale . " " I did n't see any storm . " Following him into the bedroom , to see if she could be of help with the drink , she got a shock . It was a tiny cubicle , with one window and a hummocksy bed , on which were her trench coat and a cocktail service , consisting of a great silver shaker , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But not seven feet away , in the smallest , meanest bathroom she had ever seen , he was chopping away at a piece of ice he had evidently procured earlier in the day . Near him , on a small table , she could see a little two-burner gas fixture , a box of eggs , a package of bacon , and a can of coffee . Wishing she had n't come , she went back and resumed her seat by the fire . He served the drinks presently , and she had two . When he reached for the shaker to pour her a third , she stopped him . " If I 'm going to drive , I think I 've had enough . " " Drive ? Where to ? " " Why  --  is n't the Biltmore where we 're going ? " " Mildred  --  we 're not going anywhere . " " Well we certainly are . " " Listen  --  " He stepped over and snapped on a small radio . An excited announcer was telling of bridges down between Glendale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road , of the fear that a whole family had been lost with the car . She tossed her head petulantly . " Well my goodness , the Biltmore 's not in Burbank . " " Wherever it is , and however we go to get to it , we have to cross the Los Angeles River , and by last report it 's a raging torrent , with half the bridges out and three feet of water boiling over the rest . We 're not going . The New Year 's party is here . " He filled her glass and she began to sulk . In spite of the liquor , the main idea of the evening was still clear in her mind , and this turn of events was badly interfering with it . When he put his arm around her , she did n't respond . Amiably , he said she was a very problematical drunk . On two drinks she 'd argue with Jesus Christ , on three she 'd agree with Judas Iscariot . Now would she kindly tilt over No. 3 , so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Year the way it deserved ? When she did n't touch the drink , lie asked for her key , so he could put her car in the garage . When she made no move to give it to him , he went downstairs . Somewhere in the house , water began to drip . She shivered , for the first time really becoming aware of the rain that was cascadingdown the windows , roaring on the roof . She began to blame him for that too : When he came back , and took a sharp look at her face , he seemed a little bored . " Well , if you still feel like that , I suppose there 's nothing to do but go to bed . . . . I pulled that cloth clear over your car , so it 'll probably be all right . I have green pajamas and red . Which do you prefer ? " " I 'm not going to bed . " " You 're not very amusing here . " " I 'm going home . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll put out the green pajamas , and  --  " " I have n't gone yet . " " Of course you have n't . I 'm inviting  --  " " Why did you tell her that ? " What with the liquor , the rain , and his manner , her grievances had heavy compression behind them now , and she exploded with a snarl that left her without the least recollection of all the stuffy little things she had intended to say . He looked at her in astonishment . " Tell whom what ? If you do n't mind my asking . " " You know perfectly well what I 'm talking about . How could you say such things to that child ? And who gave you the right to talk about my legs anyhow ? " " Everybody else does . Why not me ? "  | " What ? " " Oh come , come , come . Your legs are the passion of your life . They all but get a cheer when you appear with them in that Pie Wagon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ought to wear your skirts longer . But you do want them talked about , and looked at , and generally envied , so why this howling fit ? And after all , they are damned goodlooking . " " We 're talking about my child . " " Oh for God 's sake , what do you mean , child ? If she 's a child , she 's forgotten more about such things than you 'll ever know . You ought to keep up with the times . I do n't know how it was once  --  maybe the sweet young things were told by their mothers at the age of seventeen and were greatly surprised , you ca n't prove it by me . But now  --  they know all there is to know before they 've even been told about Santa Claus . Anyway , she knows . What am I supposed to do ? Act like a zany when I drive off with you at night and do n't bring you back until the next morning ? Do you think she does n't know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many times . " " And you tell her ? " " Sure . She greatly admires my capacity  --  and yours . Yours she simply ca n't get over . Who 'd think the poor mope had it in her ? " ' As Monty mimicked Veda , Mildred knew this was nothing he had invented , as a sort of counter-offensive . Her rage mounted still higher . She said " I see , " then said it over again , three or four times . Then , getting up and going over to him , she asked : " And how about the best legs being found in kitchens , not in the drawing room ? " " What in the hell are you talking about ? " " You know what I 'm talking about . " Monty stared , touched his brow , as though in a great effort of recollection . Then , snapping his fingers briskly , he said : " Oh , I knew there was something familiar about that . Yes , I did give a little dissertation along those lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a uniform of some sort , and an apron  --  quite a pretty little thing , especially around the ankles . And I got that off  --  what you 've just quoted . Nothing original , I assure you . I had almost forgotten it .... How does that concern us ? " He was plausible , circumstantial , casual , but a little flicker around the eyes betrayed him . Mildred did n't answer his question . She came over close , and there was something snakelike about her as she said : " That 's a lie . You were n't talking about any girl you saw on the street . You were talking about me . " Monty shrugged and Mildred went back to her chair and sat down . Then she began to talk slowly , but with rising stridency . She said he had deliberately tried to set Veda against her , to hold her up to ridicule , to make the child think of her as an inferior , somebody to be ashamed of . " I see it all now . I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people over here in Pasadena to see her once in a while . Not that I do n't give her the opportunity . Not that I do n't remind her that you ca n't accept invitations all the time without giving any in return . Not that I did n't do my part . But no . Because you were filling her up with all this foolishness she 's been ashamed to ask these peopleover . She actually believes Glendale is not good enough for them . She thinks I 'm not good enough . She  --  " " Oh for God 's sake shut up . " Monty 's eyes were black now , and had little hard points of light in them . " In the first place , what invitations did she accept ? My mother 's , right here in this house . Well , we went all over that once , and we 're not going over it again . And to the Hannens ' . And so far as I know the only invitation Charlie and Roberta ever got out of you was an invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagon , and they did go over , and  --  " " No check was ever presented to them . " " O.K. , then you 're square . For the rest , who the hell would expect a kid of fourteen to be doing something about every cocktail party I dragged her to ? She asked about it , and I said it would be silly . Come on . What else ? " " That may be all right for older people . But there have been plenty of others she 's met , girls her own age  --  " " No , there have n't . And right there 's where I suggest you get better acquainted with your own daughter . She 's a strange child . Girls her own age do n't interest her . She likes older women  --  " " If they 're rich . " " Anyway , she 's damned nice to them . And it 's unusual as hell . And you ca n't blame them for liking it . And liking her . But as for her trying to throw some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to do , make me laugh ? " In some elusive , quicksilver way that she could n't get her finger on , Mildred felt the argument slipping away from her , and like Veda , she abandoned logic and began to scream : p 171 " You 've set her against me ! I do n't care a bit for your fine talk  --  you 've set her against me ! " Monty lit a cigarette , smoked sullenly a few moments without speaking . Then he looked up . " Ah ! So this is why you came . Stupid of me not to have thought of it sooner . " " I came because I was invited . " " On a night like this ? " " It 's as good a time as any other . " " What a nice little pal you turned out to be .... Funny  --  I had something to say , too . " " He looked with a little self-pitying smile into the fire , evidentlydecided to keep his intentions to himself , then changed his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd make a fine wife for somebody  --  if you did n't live in Glendale . " She had been feeling outpointed , but at this all her self-righteousnesscame back . Leaning forward , she stared at him . " Monty , you can still say that ? After what I 've said to you ? Just to have somebody take care of you , you 'd ask me to marry you ? Have n't you any more self-respect than that ? " " Ah , but that 's what I was going to say . " " Monty , do n't make it any worse than it is . If I got excited about it , you were going to let it stay said . If I did n't , you were going to pretend that was what you were going to say . Gee , Monty , but you 're some man , are n't you ? " " Now suppose you listen to what 1 am going to say . " " No , I 'm going home . " She got up , but he leaped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back in her chair . The little glittering points of light in his eyes were dancing now , and his face was drawn and hard . " Do you know why Veda never invites anybody to that house of yours ? Do you know why nobody , except that stringbean that lives next door , ever goes there ? " " Yes  --  because you set her against me and  --  " " Because you are a goddam varlet , and you 're afraid to have people come there , because you would n't know what to do about them  --  you just have n't got the nerve . " Looking into his contorted face , she suddenly had the same paralyzed , shrunken feeling she had had the morning Miss Turner told her off , and sent her over to the housekeeper 's job , because there was nothing else she could do . And she kept shrinking , as Monty went on , pouring a torrent of bitter , pas-p 172 sionate invective at her . " It 's not her . It 's not me . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That Veda has a hundred friends , here , there , everywhere she goes , and that you have n't any ? No , I 'm wrong  --  you have one . That bartender . And that 's all . Nobody ever gets invited to your house , nobody  --  " " What are you talking about ? How can I give parties , or invitepeople , with a living to make ? Why you  --  " " Living , my eye ! That 's the alibi , not the reason . You damned little kitchen scullion , you 'll tell me who 's setting your child against you ? Me ? Listen , Mildred . Nobody but a varlet would give one second 's thought to what you 've been talking about tonight . Because that 's the difference . A lady does n't care . A varlet does . " He walked around , panting , then turned on her again . " And I like a fool , like a damned idiot , I once thought maybe I 'd been mistaken , that you were a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed me the $20 bill that night , and I took it . And then I took more . I even gave you credit for something , God knows what it is , some sense of humor that only an aristocrat ever has , and asked you for money . And then what ? Could you go through with it ? The very thing that you yourself started ? A lady would have cut her heart out before she let me know the money meant anything . But you , before I had even fifty bucks out of you , you had to make a chauffeur out of me , did n't you ? To get your money 's worth ? A lackey , a poodle dog . You had to rub it in . Well no more . I 've taken my last dime off you , and God willing , before my sun goes . down , I 'll pay you back . Why you scum , you  --  waitress . I guess that 's one reason I love Veda . She would n't pick up a tip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither would I. " " Except from me . " White with rage , she opened her evening bag , took out a crisp $10 bill , threw it at his feet . He took the fire tongs , picked it up , dropped it on the fire . When the flame flared up he took out a handkerchief and mopped his face . For a time , nothing was said by either of them , and when their panting had died down , Mildred began to feel ashamed , defeated , and miserable . She had said it all , had goaded him to say it all too , those things that she knew he felt , and that left her crumpled and unable to answer . Yet nothing had been settled : there he was and there she was . As she looked at him , she sawp 173 for the first time that he was tired , worn , and haggard , with just a touch of middle age dragging at what she had always thought of as a youthful face . Then a gush of terrible affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt , and something motherly . She wanted to cry , and suddenly reached over and rubbed his bald spot . For a long time , it had been a little joke between them . He made no move , but he did n't repulseher either , and when she leaned back she felt better . Then again she heard the rain , and for the first time was afraid of it . She drew the coat around her . Then she picked up Manhattan No. 3 , drank half of it , set it down again . Without looking at her , he filled her glass . They sat a long time , neither of them looking at the other . Then abruptly , as though he had solved a very difficult problem , he banged his fist on the arm of his chair , and said : " Damn it , what this needs is the crime of rape ! " He came over , put one arm around her , slipped the other under her legs , and carried her into the bedroom . A little moaninglaugh escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She felt weak and drugged . In a moment , the brocadedcoat was off , was sliding to the floor . She thought of her dress , and did n't care : she wanted him to rip it off her , to tear it away in shreds , if he had to , so he got her out of it . But he was n't ripping it off . He was fumbling with the zipper , and for a moment her fingers were over his , trying to help . Then somethingstirred inside of her , an unhappy recollection of what she had come for , of what had been piling up between them these last few months . She fought it off , tried to make it sink under the overwhelming blend of liquor , man , and rain . It would n't sink . If she had lifted a mountain , it could n't have been harder than it was to put both palms in Monty 's face , push him away , squirm off the bed , and lurch to her feet . She grabbed both coats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to drag her back , but she fought him off as she snatched up the galoshes and dashed into the dark hall . Somehow , she got through the ghostly rooms , down the stairs , and to the front door . It was locked . She twisted the big brass key , and at last was on the portico , in the cold wet air . She pulled on both coats , stepped into the galoshes . Then suddenly the light came on , and he was beside her , reaching for her , trying to pull her back . She dashed out into the rain , yanked the 174 cloth off the car , let it fall in the mud , and jumped in . As she snapped on the lights and started the motor , she could see him under the light , gesticulating at her , expostulating with her . There was nothing of passion in his face now . He was angrily telling her not to be a fool , not to go out in that storm . She started out . On Orange Grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look so sleek and harmless . She pulled in to the curb , found the kerchief in the trench coat pocket , tied it around her head . Then , cautiously , feeling a throb of fright every time the car bucked in the wind , she went on . As she turned at the traffic circle , she caught the lights of another car , behind . There were no men with lanterns now , nothing but the black , wild , and terrible night . She got over the bridge without trouble , but when she came to the detour , she was afraid , and waited untilthe other car caught up a little . Then she went on , noting with relief that the other car turned into the detour too . She had no trouble for a mile or so , and then she came to the washout . To her dismay it had spread : the road was completely blocked . All resolution having deserted her , she stopped and waited , to see what the other car was going to do . It stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she strained her eyes to see . Then Monty 's face was at the window , not six inches from her own . Water was pouring off an old felt hat , and off the slicker that was buttoned to his ears . Furiously he pointed at the washout . " Look at that ! It never occurred to you there 'd be something like that , did it ? Damn it , the trouble you 're putting me to ! " For a moment or two , as he savagely ordered her to lock the car , get out , and come back with him , she had a happy , contentedfeeling , as though he were her father , she a bad little girl that would be taken care of , anyway . Then once more her fixed resolve rose in her . She shifted into reverse and backed . She backed past his car , came to a corner , headed into it . When she had followed the new road a few feet , she saw it led down into Eagle Rock . It was full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braking , then rolling on again . Then ahead of her she saw that the rubble stopped , that a black shining road lay ahead . She stepped on the gas . It was the check of the car that told her the black shining road was black shining water . When she stepped on the brake the car slid right on . The lights went out . The motor stopped . The car stopped . She was alone in a poolp 175 that extended as far as she could see . When she took her foot off the brake she felt it splash into a puddle . She screamed . The rain was driving against her , and she wound up the window . Outside , she could hear the purling of the torrent against the wheels , and in a moment or two the car began to move . She guided it to the right , and when she felt it catch the curb , pulled up the hand brake . Then she sat there . In a few minutes , her breath had misted the glass so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerked open , and once more Monty was standing there . He . had evidently gone back to his car to take off his trousers , for as the slicker floated on the pool she could see he was in his shorts . IIe braced his right arm against the door jamb . " All right , now throw your legs over my arm , and put your arm around my neck . Hold on tight , and I think I can get you to the top of the hill . " She lifted her feet to the seat , took off the gold shoes and stockings , put them in the dashboard compartment . Then she put on the galoshes , over her bare feet . Then she wriggled out of both coats and the dress . The dress and the brocaded coat she stuffed over the shoes , closed the compartment and locked it . Then , shivering , she got into the trench coat . Then she motioned to Monty to move his hand . When he did , she pulled the door shut and snapped the catch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A yelp came out of her as she stepped off the running board and felt the water around her thighs , and the current almost swept her off her feet . But she held on to the door handle and steadied herself . Above her was a high bank , evidently with some sort of sidewalk on top of it . Paying no attention to Monty and his barely audible shouts , she scrambled up , and then slipped , slid , and staggered home through the worst storm in the annals of the Los Angeles weather bureau , or of any weather bureau . She passed many cars stalled as hers was stalled , some deserted , some full of people . One car , caught between vast lakes of water , was standing near a curb , its top lights on , filled with people in evening clothes , helpless to do anything but sit . She slogged on , up the long hill to Glendale , down block after block of rubble , torrents , seas of water . Her galoshes filled repeatedly , and periodicallyshe stopped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , to let the water run out . But she could n't let the sand and pebbles out , and they cut her feet cruelly . She was in a hysteria of weakness , cold , and pain when she finally reachedp 176 Pierce Drive , and half ran , half limped , the rest of the way to the house . Veda and Letty , like two frightened kittens , had n't slept very well that night , and when lights began to snap on in the house , and a sobbing , mud-spattered , staggering apparition appeared at their door , they screamed in terror . When they realized it was Mildred , they dutifully followed her to her room , but it was secondsbefore they got readjusted to the point of helping her out of her clothes and getting her into bed . But suddenly Letty recoveredfrom her fright , and was soon running around frantically , getting Mildred what she needed , especially whiskey , coffee , and a hot-water bottle . Veda sat on the bed , chafing Mildred 's hands , spooning the scalding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Presently she shook her head . " But Mother , I simply ca n't understand it . Why did n't you stay with him ? After all , it would n't have been much of a novelty . " " Never mind . Tomorrow you get your piano . " At Veda 's squeal of delight , at the warm arms around her neck , the sticky kisses that started at her eyes and ended away below her throat , Mildred relaxed , found a moment of happiness . As the gray day broke , she fell into a deep sleep.  |p177FOR  SOME TIME after that , Mildred was too busy to pay much attention to Veda . Relieved of Monty , she began to have money , above installments on the piano and everything else . In spite of hard times , her business grew better ; the bar shook down into a profitable sideline ; most important of all , she paid off the last of the $4,000 she had owed for the property , and the last of her equipment notes . Now the place was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering for some time . The pies put a dreadful strain on her kitchen , so she built an annex , out back of the parking space , to house them as a separate unit . There was some little trouble about it , on account of the zoning regulations . But when she submitted acceptable exterior plans , which made it look like a rather large private garage , and agreed to display no advertising except the neon sign she was already using , the difficultywas smoothed out . When it was finished , she added pastriesto her list , clever items suitable for restaurant perambulators , and had little trouble selling them . I Lois presently needed an assistant , and then another . She bought a new truck , a really smart one . About the same time she turned in the car , never quite recovered from the battering it took in the storm , and bought a new one , a sleek maroon Buick with white tires that Veda kissed when the dealer delivered it . But when Ida , who was a regular visitor now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then one night started a campaign to get Mildred to open a branch in Beverly , with herself as manager . " Mildred , I know what I 'm talking about . That town is just crying for a place that will put out a real line of ready desserts . Think of the entertaining they do over there . Them movie people giving parties every night , and the dessert nothing but a headache to them women . And look how easy you can give them what they want  --  why you 're making all that stuff right now . And look at the prices you 'll get . And look at the sidelines you got . Look at the fountain trade . Look at the sandwich trade . Andp 178 I can do it all with four girls , a fountain man , a short-order cook , and a dish-washer . " Mildred , not wanting to assume risk when she had a certainty , was in no hurry about it . But she drove over to Beverly and made inquiries , and began to suspect that Ida was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran into a vacant property that she knew would be right for location . When she found out she could get a lease for an absurdly small rental , she made up her mind . There followed another hectic month of furniture , fixtures , and alterations . She wanted the place done in maple , but Ida obstinately held out for light green walls and soft , upholsteredbooths where people would find it comfortable to sit . Mildredgave way , hut on the day of the opening she almost fainted . Without consulting her , Ida had ordered a lot of preserves , cakes , health breads , and other things she knew nothing about . Ida however said she herself knew all about them , at any rate all that was necessary to know . By the end of the week , Mildred was not only convinced , but completely flabbergasted . Ida 's reportwas ecstatic : " Mildred , we 're in . In the first place I got a lunch trade that 's almost like the Brown Derby . People that do n't want planked whitefish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the fruit salads , and you just ought to hear the comment . And I do n't hardly get them cleared out before I got a college trade , wonderful refined kids on their way home from Westwood that want a chocolate soda or a malt before they start playing tennis . And when they go my tea trade starts , and on top of that I got a little dinner trade , people that want to eat light before they catch a preview or something . And then on top of that I got a late trade , people that just want a cup of chocolate and a place to talk . From twelve noon until twelve midnight I got business . And the take-out trade from those people , it 's enough to take your breath away . " The receipts bore her out . Ida was to get $30 a week , plus 2 per cent of the gross . She had hoped , in time , to make $50 a week . That very first Saturday night Mildred wrote her a check for $53.71 . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she heard what Mildred was up to , flew into a rage , and wanted to know why Ida had been singled out to manage the Beverly branch , instead of herself . Mildred tried to explain that it was all Ida 's idea , that some people are suited to one thing , some to another , but got nowhere . Mrs. Gessler continued bitter , and Mildred grew worried . She had come to depend on her tall , thin , profane bartender as she depended on nobody else , not only for shrewdp 179 business advice but also for some sort of emotional support that her nature demanded . Losing her would be a calamity , and she began to consider what could be done . At that time there was considerable talk about the rise of Laguna Beach , a resort along the coast , a few miles below Long Beach . Mildred began to wonder if it would be a good place for still another branch , with Mrs. Gessler in charge . She drove down a number of times and looked it over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed her , and unquestionably the resort was coming up , not only for summer trippers , but for year-round residents as well . Again it was the lease that decided her . She found a large house , with considerable land around it , on a bluff , overlooking the ocean . With an expert eye , she noted what would have to be done to it , noted that the grounds would be expensive to keep up . But when the terms were quoted to her , they were so low that she knew she could make a good profit if she got any business at all . They were so low that for a brief time she was suspicious , but the agent said the explanation was simple enough . It had been a private home , but it could n't be rented for that , as it was entirely too big for most of the people who came down from the city just to get a coat of tan . Furthermore , the beach in front of it was studded with rocks and was therefore unsuitable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if she could use it , it was hers at the rate quoted . Mildred inspected the view , the house , the grounds , and felt a little tingle inside . Abruptly , she paid $25 cash for a ten-day option , and that night held Mrs. Gessler after closing time for a little talk . But she barely got started when Mrs. Gessler broke in : " Oh shut up , will you for God 's sake shutup ? " " But  --  are n't you interested ? " " Does a duck like water ? Listen , it 's halfway between L. A. and San Diego , is n't it ? Right on the main line , and Ike still has his trucks . It 's the first honest-to-God 's chance he 's had to get started again , in a legal way , since  --  well , you know . And it gets him out of this lousy place . Do you want me bawling right on your shoulder ? " " What 's the matter with this place ? " " It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm working , see , and he has to find something to do with himself , at night . So he finds it . He says it 's pool , and he does come home with chalk all over him , I 'll say that for him . But he 's a liar . It 's a frazzle-haired blonde that works in one of those antique furniture factories onp 180 Los Feliz . Nothing serious maybe , but he sees her . It 's what I 've been so jittery about , if you 've got to know . And now , if I can just get him out of here , and in business again so he can hold his head up  --  well , maybe that 'll be that . Go on , tell me some more . " So once again Mildred was in a flurry of alterations , purchases of inventory , and arguments about policy . She wanted a duplicateof the Glendale place , which would specialize in chicken , waffles , and pies , and operate a small bar as a sideline . Mrs. Gessler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come all the way to the ocean just to get chicken ? Not if I know them . They want a shore dinner  --  fish , lobster , and crab  --  and that 's what we 're giving them . And that 's where we make the dough . Do n't forget : fish is cheap . But we 've got to have a little variety , so we give them steak , right from our own built-in charcoal broiler . " When Mildred protested that she knew nothing about steaks , or fish , or lobster , or crab , and would be helpless to do the marketing , Mrs. Gessler replied she could learn . It was n't until she sent for Mr. Otis , the federal meat inspector who had been romantic about her in her waitress days , that her alarm eased a little . He came to the Glendale restaurant one night , and confirmedher suspicions that there were about a hundred different ways to lose money on steaks . But when he talked with Mrs. Gessler he was impressed . He told Mildred she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out . It depended mainly , he said , on the chef , and to Mildred 's surprise he recommended Archie , of Mr. Chris 's establishment . Archie , he assured her , had been wasted for years in a second class place , but " he 's still the best steak man in town , bar none . Any bum can cook fish and make money on it , so do n't worry about that . But on steaks , you 've got to have somebody that knows his stuff . You ca n't go wrong on Archie . " " So Mildred stole Archie off Mr. Chris , and under his dour supervision installed the built-in charcoal broiler . Presently , after signs had been put up along the road , and announcements insertedin the Los Angeles papers , the place opened . It was never the snug little gold mine that Ida 's place was , for Mrs. Gessler was careless of expenses , and tended to slight the kitchen in favor of the bar . But her talent at making a sort of club out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which she worked out the arrangements drew Mildred 's reluctantadmiration . The big living room of the house was converted into a maple-panelled bar , with dim lights . The rooms behindp 181 it were joined together in a cluster of small dining rooms , each with a pleasant air of intimacy about it . One of them opened on a veranda that ran around the house , and out here were tables for out-door drinkers , bathing suiters , and the overflow trade . But the most surprising thing to Mildred was the flower garden . She had never suspected Mrs. Gessler of any such weakness , but within a few weeks the whole brow of the bluff was planted with bushes , and here , it appeared , was where Mrs. Gessler spent her mornings , spading , pruning , and puttering with a Japanese gardener . The expense , what with the water and the gardener , was high , but Mrs. Gessler shrugged it off . " We 're running a highclassdump , Baby , and we 've got to have something . For some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table likes to listen to the bumble-bees . " But when the flowers began to bloom , Mildred paid without protest , because she liked them . At twilight , just before the dinner rush , she would stroll among them , smelling them and feeling proud and happy . On one of these strolls Mrs. Gessler joined her , and then loci her a block or two down the main road that ran through the town . Then she stopped and pointed , and across the street Mildred saw the sign : GESSLERLONG &; SH0RT DISTANCEII AU LINGDAY &; NIGHTSERVICE ! Mrs. Gessler looked at it intently . " He 's on call all the time , too . All he needed was a chance . Next week he 's getting a new truck , streamlined . " " Is everything all right upstairs ? " Mildred had reference to the terms of Mrs. Gessler 's employment . She did n't get $30 a week and 2 per cent of the gross , as Ida did . She got $30 and 1 per cent , the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper part of the house , with light , heat , water , food , laundry , and everything furnished . Mrs. Gessler nodded . " Everything 's flue . Ike loves those big rooms , and the sea , and the steaks , and  --  well , believe it or not he even likes the flowers . Service with a gardenia '  --  he 's thinking of havingit lettered on the new truck . We 're living again , that 's all . " Mildred never cooked anything herself now , or put on a uniform . At Glendale , Mrs. Kramer had been promoted to cook , with an assistant named Bella ; Mrs. Gessler 's place was taken byp 182 a man bartender , named Jake ; on nights when Mildred was at Beverly or Laguna , Sigrid acted as hostess , and wore the white uniform . Mildred worked from sun-up , when her marketing started , until long after dark ; she worked so hard she began to feel driven , and relieved herself of every detail she could possiblyassign to others . She continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure , but it was distinctly plump . Her face was losing such little color as it had had , and she no longer seemed younger than her years . In fact , she was beginning to look matronly . The car itself , she discovered , took a great deal out of her , and she engaged a driver named Tommy , older brother to Carl , who drove the truck . After some reflection she took him to Bullock 's and bought him a uniform , so he could help on the parking lots . When Veda first saw him in this regalia , she did n't kiss him , as she had kissed the car . She gave her mother a long , thoughtful look , full of something almost describableas respect . And in spite of mounting expenses , the driver , the girl Mildredengaged to keep the books , the money kept rolling in . Mildred paid for the piano , paid off the mortgages Bert had plastered on the house ; she renovated , repainted , kept buying new equipment for all her establishments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Roosevelt came up for reelection , she was still smarting from the tax she had paid on her 1935 income , and for a few weeks wavered in her loyalty . But then business picked up , and when he said " we planned it that way , " she decided she had to take the bitter with the sweet , and voted for him . She began to buy expensive clothes , especially expensive girdles , to make her look thin . She bought Veda a little car , a Packard 120 , in dark green , " to go with her hair . " On Wally 's advice , she incorporated , choosing Ida and Mrs. Gessler as her two directors , in addition to herself . Her big danger , Wally said , was the old woman in Long Beach . " O.K. , she 's crossing against the lights , Tommy had his brakes on when he hit her , she 's not hurt a bit , but when she finds out you 've got three restaurants just watch what she does to you . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later you 're going to have those five people that got ptomaine poisoning , from the fish , or say they did . And what those harpies do to you , once they get in court , will be just plain murder . You incorporate , your personal property is safe . " The old woman in Long Beach , to say nothing of the five harpies on their pots , fretted Mildred terribly , as many things did . She bought fantastic liability insurance , on the car , on the pie fac- tory , on the restaurants . It was horribly expensive , but worth it , to be safe . Through all the work , however , the endless driving , the worry , the feeling there were not enough hours in the day for all she had to do , one luxury she permitted herself . No matter how the day broke , she was home at three o'clock in the afternoon , for what she called her " rest . " It was a rest , to be sure , but that was n't the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sole auditor . When Veda turned sixteen , she persuadeddred to let her quit high school , so she could devote her whole time to music . In the morning she did harmony , and what she called " paper work . " In the afternoon she practiced . For two hours she practiced exercises , but at three she began to practice pieces , and it was then that Mildred arrived . Tiptoeing in the back way , she would slip into the hall , and for a moment stand looking into the living room , where Veda was seated at the satiny black grand . It was a picture that never failed to thrill her : the beautiful instrument that she had worked for and paid for , the no less beautiful child she had brought into the world ; a picture moreover , that she could really call her own . Then , after a soft " I 'm home , darling , " she would tiptoe to her bedroom , lie down , and listen . She did n't know the panics of many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually played one . There was one iii particular , something by Chopin , that she liked best of all , " because it reminds toe of that song about rainbows . " Veda , somewhat ironically , said : " Well Mother , there 's a reason " ; but she played it , nevertheless . Mildred was delighted at the way the child was coming along : warm , shy intimacy continued , and Mildred laughed to think she had once supposed that Monty had something to do with it . This , she told herself , was what made everything worth while . One afternoon the concert was interrupted by a phone call . Veda answered , and from the tone of her voice , Mildred knew something was wrong . She came in and sat on the bed , but to Mildred 's " What is it darling ? " returned no answer at once . Then , after a few moments of gloomy silence , she said : " Hannen'shad a hemorrhage . " " Oh my , is n't that awful ! " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three little ones . This one caught him on the street , while he was walking home from the postoffice . The ambulance doctor made a mess of it  --  had him lifted by the shoulders or something  --  and it 's a lotp 184worse than it might have been . Mrs. Hannen 's almost in hysterics about it . " " You have to go over there . At once . " " Not today . He 's all packed in icebags , and they give him some kind of gas to inhale . It 's just hell . " " Is there something I could do ? I mean , if there are any special dishes he needs , I can send anything that 's wanted , hot , all ready to serve  --  " " I can find out . " Veda stared at the Gessler house , now for rent . Then : " God , but I 'm going to miss that damned he-bear . " " Well my goodness , he 's not gone yet . " Mildred said this sharply . She had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her it was almost blasphemous not to hope for the best . But Veda got up heavily and spoke quietly . " Mother , it 's bad . I know from the way he 's been acting lately that he 's known it would be bad , when it came . I can tell from the way she was wailing over that phone that it 's bad . ... And what I 'm going to do I do n't know . " Special dishes , it turned out , were needed desperately , on the chance that the stricken man could he tempted to eat , and in that way build up his strength . So daily , for a week , a big hamper was delivered by Tommy , full of chicken cooked by Mildred herself , tiny sandwiches prepared by Ida , cracked crab nested in ice by Archie , sherries selected by Mrs. Gessler . Mildred Pierce , Inc. , spit on its hands to show what it could do . Then one day Mildred and Veda took the hamper over in person , together with a great bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the morning paper was still on the grass , a market circularwas stuffed under the door . They rang , and there was no answer . Veda looked at Mildred , and Tommy carried the things back to the car . That afternoon , a long , incoherent telegram arrived for Mildred , dated out of Phoenix , Ariz. , and signed by Mrs. Hannen . It told of the wild ride to the sanitarium there , and begged Mildred to have the gas turned off . Three days later , while Mildred was helping Ida get ready for the Beverly luncheon rush , Veda 's car pulled up at the curb . Veda got out , looking half combed and queer . When Mildred unlocked the door for her , she handed over the paper without speaking , went to a booth , and sat down . Mildred stared at the unfamiliar picture of Mr. Hannen , taken before his hair turned white , read the notice of his death with a blank , lost feeling . Then , noting that the funeral was to be held in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers . Then she called Western Union , and dictated a long telegram to Mrs. Hannen , full of " heart-felt sympathy from both Veda and myself . " Then , still under some dazed compulsion to do something , she stood there , trying to think what . But that seemed to be all . She went over and sat down with Veda . After a while Veda asked one of the girls to bring her coffee . Mildred said : " Would you like to ride to Laguna with me , darling ? " " All right . " For the rest of the day , Veda tagged at Mildred 's heels , silent about Mr. Hannen , but afraid , apparently , to be alone . The next day she hung around the house , and when Mildred came home at three , the piano was silent . The day after that , when she still moped , Mildred thought it time to jog her up a bit . Finding her in the den , she said : " Now darling , I know he was a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you did all you could do , and after all , these things happen , and  --  " " Mother . " " Veda spoke quietly , as one would speak to a child . " It is n't that I was fond of him . Not that I did n't love the shaggy brute . To me he 'll always be the one and only , and  --  oh well , never mind . But  --  be taught me music , and  --  " " But darling there are other teachers . " " Yes , about seven hundred fakes and advertisers in Los Angelesalone , and I do n't know one from another , and besides  --  " Veda broke off , having evidently intended to say something , and then changed her mind . Mildred felt something coming , and waited . But Veda evidently decided she was n't going to say it , and Mildred asked : " Ca n't you make inquiries ? " " There 's one man here , just one , that Hannen had some respect for . His name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He conducts a lot of those operas and things out at the Hollywood Bowl . I do n't know if he takes piano pupils or not , but lie might know of somebody . " " Do you want me to call him up ? " Veda took so long answering that Mildred became impatient , and wanted to know what it was that Veda was holding back , anyway . " Has it anything to do with money ? You know I do n't begrudge anything for your instruction , and  --  " " Then  --  call him up . " Mr. Treviso 's studio was located in down-town Los Angeles , in a building with several signs beside the door , and as Mildredp 186 and Veda walked up to the second floor , a bedlam of noises assailed their ears ; tenors vocalizing , pianists running dizzy scales , violinists sawing briskly in double stops . They did n't get in to Mr. Treviso at once . Their knock was answered by a short , fat woman with an Italian accent , who left them in a windowless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sounds from within . A baritone would sing a phrase , then stop . Then there would be muffled talk . Then he would sing the same phrase again , and there would be more talk . This went on and on , until Mildred became annoyed . Veda , however , seemed mildly interested . " It 's the end of the Pagliacci Prologue , and he ca n't hit the G on pitch . Well , there 's nothing to do about him . Treviso might just as well save his time . " " To say nothing of my time . " " Mother , this is a wop . So we sit . " Presently the baritone , a stocky , red-faced boy , popped through the door and left sheepishly , and the woman came out and motionedthem in . Mildred entered a studio that was rather different from Mr. Hannen 's . It was almost as large , but nothing like as austere . The great black piano stood near the windows , and the furniture matched it , in size as well as elegance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of celebritiesso big that even Mildred had heard of some of them , and all inscribed personally to Mr. Treviso . That gentleman himself , clad in a gray suit with black piping on the waistcoat , received them as a ducal counselor might have received a pair of lesser ladies in waiting . A tall , thin Italian of perhaps fifty , with bony face and sombre eyes , he listened while Mildred explained what they had come for , then bowed coldly and waved them to seats . When Veda cut in with what Mildred had neglected to mention , that she had studied with Mr. Hannen , he became slightly less formal , struck a tragic pose , and said : " Poor Charl ' . Ah poor , poor Chary ' . " Then he paid tribute to the Hannen tone , and said it marked him as a great artist , not merely as a pianist . Then , smiling a little , he permitted himself to reminisce . " I first know Chary , was in 1922 . We make tour of Italy together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charl ' play Tschaikowsky concerto . Was just after Mussolini come in , and Chary ' , ' e was afraid somebody make him drink castor hoil . Was bad afraid . ' E buy gray spat , black ' at , learn Giovanezaz , change name to Annino , do ever ' little t'ing to look like wop . So last concert , was in Turino . After concert , all go to little cafe , ' ave last drink , say good-bye . So concertmaster , ' e stand up , whole place is rightp 187 away quiet . And concertmaster , ' e make little spich , tell how fine Charl ' play Tschaikowsky concerto , say whole orchestr ' want make Charl ' little gift , express happreciation . ' E give Charl ' big mahongany box , look like ' ave gold cup in it , something pretty nice . Charl ' , ' e make little spich too , say t'anks boys , sure is big surprise . ' E open box  --  was roll toilet paper ! " Mr. Treviso 's smile had broadened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightly they almost glared . Mildred , whether because of the anecdote itself , or the recent death of its subject , or the realization that she was in the presence of a point of view completely alien to her , was n't amused , though she smiled a little , to be polite . But Veda affected to think this was the funniestthing she had ever heard in her life , and egged Mr. Treviso on to more stories . He looked at his watch and said he would now listen to her play . The Veda who sat down at the piano was a quite different Veda from the one who had so airily entertained Mr. Hannen three years ago . She was genuinely nervous , and it occurred to Mildred that her encouragement to Mr. Treviso 's story-telling might have been a stall for time . She thought a moment , then with grim face launched into a piece known to Mildred as the Brahms Rhapsody . Mildred did n't like it much . It went entirely too fast for her taste , except for a slow part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hymn . I lowever , she sat back comfortably , waiting for the praise that Mr. Treviso would bestow , and that she would tell Ida about , that night . Mr. Treviso wandered over to the window , and stood looking down at the street . When Veda got to the slow part , he half turned around , as though to say something , then did n't . All during the slow part he stared down at the street . When Veda crashed into the fast part again , he walked over and closed the piano , elaborately giving Veda time to get her hands out of the way . In the bellowing silence that followed , he went to the far corner of the studio and sat down , a ghastly smile on his face , as though he had been prepared for burial by an undertaker who specialized in pleasant expressions . It was an appreciable interval before it dawned on Mildred what he had done , and why . Then she looked toward the piano to suggest that Veda play one of her slower pieces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , pulling on her gloves , and before Mildred could say anything , she dived out the door . Mildred jumped up , followed , and in the hall called to her . But Veda was running down the stairs and did n't look up . The nextp 188 Mildred knew , Tommy was driving them home , and Veda was sitting with writhing face and clenched hands , staring horribly at the floor . Even as Mildred looked , a white line appeared on the back of one of the gloves , and it popped . All the way home Mildred fumed at the way Mr. Treviso had treated them . She said she had never seen anything like that in her life . If he did n't like the way Veda had played the piece , he could have said so like a gentleman , instead of acting like that . And the very idea , having an appointment with two ladies for four o'clock , keeping them waiting until a quarter to five , and then , when they had barely got in the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only man in Los Angeles that Mr. Hannen had ally respect for , she certainly had her opinion of Mr. Hannen 's taste . A lot of this expressed Mildred 's very real irritation , but some of it was to console Veda , by taking her side after an outrageous episode . Veda said nothing , and when they got home she jumped out of the car and ran in the house . Mildredfollowed , but when she got to Veda 's room , it was locked . She knocked , then knocked again , sharply . Then she commanded Veda to open the door . Nothing happened , and inside there was silence . Letty appeared , and asked in a frightened way what the trouble was . Paying no attention to Letty , Mildred ran out to the kitchen , grabbed a chair , and ran outside . A sudden paralyzingfear had come over her as to what Veda might be doing in there . Putting the chair near the house , she stood on it and raised the screen . Then she stepped into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the ceiling in the same unseeing way she had stared at the floor of the car . Her hands were still clenchingand unclenching , and her features looked thick . Mildred , who had expected at the very least to see an empty iodine bottle lying around somewhere , first felt relieved , then cross . Unlocking the door , she said : " Well my goodness , you do n't have to scare everybody to death . " " Mother , if you say my goodness one more time I shall scream , I shall scream ! " Veda spoke in a terrible rasping whisper , then closed her eyes . Stiffening , and stretching out her arms as though she were a figure on a crucifix , she began to talk to herself , in a bitter voice , between clenched teeth . " You can kill it  --  you can kill it right now  --  you can drive a knife through its heart  --  so it 's dead , dead , dead  --  you can forget you ever tried to play the piano  --  you canp 189 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you can  --  " " Well my g  --  . Well for heaven 's sake , the piano is n't the only thing on earth . You could  --  you could write music . " Pausing , Mildred tried to remember what Bert had said that clay , about Irving Berlin , but just then Veda opened her eyes . " You damned , silly-looking cluck , are you trying to drive me insane ? . . . Yes , I could write music . I can write you a motet , or a sonata , or a waltz , or a cornet solo , with variation  --  anything at all , anything you want . And not one note of it will be worth the match it would take to burn it . You think I 'm hot stuff , do n't you ? You , lying there every day , dreaming about rainbows . Well , I 'm not . I 'm just a Glendale Wunderkind . I know all there is to know about music , and there 's one like me in every Glendale on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park band . We can read anything , play anything , arrange anything , and we 're just no good . Punks . Like you . God , now I know where I get it from . Is n't that funny ? You start out a Wunderkind , then find out you 're just a goddarn punk . " " Well , if that 's the case , it certainly does seem peculiar that he would n't have known it . Mr. Hannen , I mean . And told you so . Instead of  --  " " Do you think he did n't know it ? And did n't tell me ? Ile told me every time he saw me -- my tunes stunk , nay playing stunk , everything I did stunk  --  but lie liked me . And he knew how I felt about it . Christ , that was something , after living with you all my life . So we went on with it , and lie thought perhaps Old Man Maturity , as he called him , might help out , later . He will like hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , and  --  will you wipe that stupid look off your face and stop acting as if it was somebody 's fault ? " " It certainly would seem , after all that work  --  " " Ca n't you understand anything at all ? They do n't pay off on work , they pay off on talent ! I 'm just no good ! I 'M NO GODDAMGOOD AND THERE 'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT ! " When a shoe whizzed past her he , Mildred went out , picked up her handbag , and started over to Beverly . She felt no resentmentat this tirade . She had got it through her head at last that something catastrophic had happened to Veda , and that it was completely beyond her power to understand . But that would n't stop her from trying , in her own way , to think what she could do about it.  |p190IN  A DAY OR SO , feeling that Veda was the victim of some sort of injustice , Mildred decided that the Messrs . Hannen and Trevisowere n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won by quitting , but by fighting hard ; that Veda should go on with her music , whether the great masters liked it or not . But when she outlined this idea to Veda , the look from the bed cut her off in the middle of a sentence . Then , unable to give up the idea that Veda was " talented , " she decided that aesthetic dancingwas the thing . There was a celebrated Russian dancer who often dined at Laguna , and this authority was sure that with Veda 's looks and good Russian instruction , things might still be straightened out . But at this Veda merely yawned . Then Mildred decided that Veda should enter one of the local schools , possibly Marlborough , and prepare herself for college . But this seemed a bit silly when Veda said : " But Mother , I ca n't roll a hoop any more . " Yet Veda continued to mope in her room , until Mildred becamethoroughly alarmed , and decided that whatever the future held , for the present something had to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of her friends and give them a little party . Conquering her loyalty to the house , the conviction that it was good enough for anything Veda might want to do in it , she said : " If you do n't want to ask them here , why not Laguna ? You can have a whole room to yourself . I can have Lucy fix up a special table , there 's an orchestra we can get , and afterwards you can dance or do anything you want . " " No , Mother . Thanks . " Mildred might have persisted in this , if it had n't been for Letty , who heard some of . In the kitchen she said to Mildred : " She ai n't going to see none of them people . Not them Pasadena people . " " Why not ? " " Do n't you know ? After she 's been Mr. Hannen 's candy kid ? The one that was going to New York and play the pyanner sop 191 they 'd all be hollering for her ? You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just be Veda ? Not her . She 's the queen , or she do n't play . She ai n't giving no party , and you ai n't either . " " I 've simply got to do something . " " Ca n't you leave her alone ? " Letty , a devoted worshipper of Veda 's by now , spoke sharply , and Mildred left the kitchen , lest she lose her temper . Leaving Veda alone was something that had n't entered her mind , but after she cooled off she thought about it . However , she was incapable of leaving Veda alone . In the first place , she had an honest concern about her . In the second place , she had become so accustomed to domineering over the many lives that depended on her , that patience , wisdom , and tolerance had almost ceased to be a part of her . And in the third place , there was this feeling she had about Veda , that by now permeated every part of her , and colored everything she did . To have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was delicious . To have her scream at her was painful , but bearable , for at least it was she that was being screamed at . To have her lying there on the bed , staring at the ceiling , and not even thinking about her , was an agony too great to be borne . Even as she was trying to be detached , to weigh Letty 's remark fairly , she was deciding that where Veda really belonged was in pictures , and meditating a way whereby a director , one of Ida 's customers , could be induced to take an interest . This brilliant scheme , however , was never put to the test . Veda snapped out of it . Appearing at Laguna one night , she blithely ordered a cocktail , downed a $3.50 steak , and mingled sociably with everybody in the place . Casually , before she left , she asked Mildred if she could order some new clothes , explainingshe had been embarrassed to go anywhere " in these rags . " Mildred , delighted at any sign of reviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything she wanted . She was a little stunned when the bills began to come in , and they footed up to more than $1,300 . And she was disturbed when she saw the clothes . Up to now , Veda had worn the quiet , wellmade , somewhat sexless toggery sanctioned by Pasadena , as suitableto girls of her age . Now , in big , expensive hats and smart , striking dresses , with powder , rouge , and lipstick thick on her face , she hardly looked like the same girl . She was , by any standard , extraordinarily good-looking . Her hair , still a soft , coppery red , was cut and waved to flow over her shoulders . Her freckles were all gone , leaving the upper part of her face , which so muchp 192 resembled Bert 's , even handsomer than it had been before : the shadows under her eyes gave her true beauty , and if the light blue of the eyes themselves , as well as the set of the resolute mouth , were a little hard , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatres , and streamlined cars . She had grown but little these last three years . Though her carriage enhancedher height , she was actually but a shade taller than Mildred . And her figure had filled out , or taken on form , or undergone some elusive change , so the Dairy was no longer the bulging asymmetry it had been in the days when Monty complainedabout it . It melted pleasantly , even excitingly , into the rest of her . But what shook up Mildred , when this new finery arrived , was the perception that this child was no longer a child . At seventeen she was a woman , and an uncommonly wise one at that . Mildred tried to like the clothes , could n't . Unable to indict them , she harped on the three-quarter mink coat , the exact model she had picked out for herself , years before , and never yet bought . Querulously , she said such a purchase should never have been made " without consulting her . " But when Veda slipped it on , and called her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged to be allowed to keep it , she gave in . Thereafter , she hardly saw Veda . In the morning , when she went out , Veda was still asleep , and at night , when she came in , Veda was n't home yet , and usually did n't arrive until two or three in the morning . One night , when Veda 's car backed and started several times before making the garage , and the footsteps sounded heavy in the hall , Mildred knew that Veda was drunk . But when she went to Veda 's door , it was locked , and there was no answer to her knock . Then one afternoon , when she came home for her rest , Veda 's car was there , and so was a dreadful girl , named Elaine . Her place of residence , it turned out , was Beverly , her occupation actress , though when Mildred asked what pictures she had acted in , the answer was merely , " characterparts . " She was tall , pretty , and cheap , and Mildred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veda had ever chosen as a friend , she tried to " be nice to her . " Then Mildred began to hear things . Ida cornered her one night , and began a long , whispere : ' harangue . " Mildred , it may be none of my business , but it 's time you knew what was going on with Veda . She 's been in here a dozen times , with that awful girl she goes around with , and not only here but at Eddie 's , across the street , and at other places . And all they 're up to is picking up men . And the men they pick up ! They 're driving all around in that car of Veda 's , and sometimes they 've got one man with them and sometimes it 's five . Five , Mildred . One day there was three inside , sitting all over the girls ' laps , and two more outside , one on each running board . And at Eddie 's they drink . . . " Mildred felt she had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her courage to start . But Veda elected to be hurt . " After all , Mother , it was you that said I could n't lie around here all the time . And just because that prissy Ida  --  oh well , let 's not get on that subject . There 's nothing to be alarmed at , Mother . I may go into pictures , that 's all . And Elaine may be a bum  --  well there 's no use being silly about it . I grant at once that she 's nothing but a tramp . But she knows directors . Lots of them . All of them . And you have to know directors to get a test . " Mildred tried conscientiously to accept this version , reminded herself that the picture career had been her own idea , too . But she remained profoundly miserable , almost physically sick . One afternoon , at the Glendale restaurant , Mildred was checkinginventory with Mrs. Kramer when Arline came into the kitchenand said a Mrs. Lenhardt was there to see her . Then , loweringher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the director 's wife . " Mildred quickly scrubbed up her hands , dried them , and went out . Then she felt her face get prickly . Arline had said Mrs. Lenhardt , but the woman near the door was the very Mrs. Forresterto whom she had applied , years before , for the job as housekeeper . She had just time to recall that Mrs. Forrester had expected to be married again when the lady turned , then came over beaming , with outstretched glove and alarming graciousness . " Mrs. Pierce ? I 've been looking forward so much to meeting you . I 'm Mrs. Lenhardt , Mrs. John Lenhardt , and I 'm sure we 're going to work out our little problem splendidly . " This greeting left Mildred badly crossed up , and as she led Mrs. Lenhardt to a table she speculated wildly as to what it might mean . She had a panicky fear that it had something to do with that visit years before , that Veda would find out she had once actually applied for a servant 's job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her visitor , she suddenly made up her mind that whatever this was about , she was going to deny everything ; deny that she had ever seen Mrs. Forrester before , or been to her house , or even considered a position as house-p 194 keeper . She had no sooner made this decision than she saw Mrs. Forrester eyeing her sharply . " But have n't we met before , Mrs. Pierce . " " Possibly in one of my restaurants . " " But I do n't go to restaurants , Mrs. Pierce . " " I have a branch in Beverly . You may have dropped in for a cup of chocolate some time , many people do . You probably saw me there . Of course , if I 'd seen you I 'd remember it . " " No doubt that 's it . " As Mrs. Lenhardt continued to stare , Arline appeared and began dusting tables . It seemed to Mildred that Arline 's ears looked bigger than usual , so she called her over , and asked Mrs. Lenhardt if she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointedly told Arline she could let the tables go until later . Mrs. Lenhardt settled into her coat like a hen occupyinga nest , and gushed : " I 've come to talk about our children , Mrs. Pierce  --  our babies , 1'in almost tempted to say , because that 's the way I really feel about them . " " Our  --  ? " " Your little one , Veda  --  she 's such a lovely girl , Mrs. Pierce . I do n't know when I 've taken a child to my heart as I have Veda . And . . . my boy . " Mildred , nervous and frightened , stared for a moment and said : " Mrs. Lenhardt , I have n't any idea what you 're talking about . " " Oh come , come , Mrs. Pierce . " " I do n't know what you mean . " Mildred 's tone was sharp , and Mrs. Lenhardt looked at her steadily , her lips smiling , her eyes not believing . Then she broke into a high , shrill laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me , Mrs. Pierce . I should have explained that my boy , my baby , is Sam Forrester . " As Mildred still stared , Mrs. Lenhardt saw at last that this might not be pretense . Her manner changing , she leaned forward and asked eagerly : " You mean Veda has n't told you anything ? " " Not a word . " " . Ah ! " Mrs. Forrester was excited now , obviously aware of her advantage in being able to give Mildred her own version of this situation , whatever it was , first . She stripped off her gloves and shot appraising glances at Mildred for some time before proceeding . Then : " Shall I begin at the beginning , Mrs. Pierce ? " p 195 " Please . " " They met  --  well it seems only yesterday , actually it was several weeks ago , at my house . My husband , no doubt you 've heard of him  --  he 's a director , and he was considering Veda for a part . And as he so often does with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he asked her over  --  Veda and her little friend Elaine , another lovely child , Mrs. Pierce . My husband has known her for years , and  --  " " Yes , I 've met her . " " So it was at my own house , Mrs. Pierce , that Veda and Sam met . And it was simply love at first sight . It must have been , because that boy of mine , Mrs. Pierce , is so sincere , so  --  " " You mean they 're engaged ? " " I was coming to that . No , I would n't say they were engaged . In fact I know that Sammy had no such thing in mind . But Veda has somehow got the idea that  --  well , I understand it , of course . Any girl wants to get married , but Sam had no such thing in mind . I want that made clear . " Mrs. Lenhardt 's voice was becoming a little high , a little strident , and she waggled a stiff forefinger at Mildred as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll agree with me , Mrs. Pierce , that any discussion of marriage between them would be most unde-sirable . " " Why ? " So far as Mildred was concerned , marriage for Veda would have been a major calamity , but at Mrs. Lenhardt 's manner she bristled with hot partisanship . Mrs. Lenhardt snapped : " Because they 're nothing but children ! Veda ca n't be over nineteen  --  " " She 's seventeen . " " And my boy is twenty . That 's too young . Mrs. Pierce , it 's entirely too young . Furthermore , they move in two different worlds  --  " " What different worlds ? " Mildred 's eyes blazed , and Mrs. Lenhardt hastily backed off . " That is n't quite what I mean , Mrs. Pierce , of course . Let us say different communities . They have different backgrounds , differentideals , different friends . And of course , Sam has always been used to a great deal of money  --  " " Do you think Veda has n't ? " " I 'm sure she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may find she 's been used to just as much as your boy has , and more . I 'm not exactly on relief , I can tell you . " p 196 " But you did n't let me finish , Mrs. Pierce . If Veda 's accustomed to wealth and position , so much the more reason that this thing should not for a second be considered . I want to make this clear : If Sammy gets married , he 'll be completely on his own , and it will certainly be hard for two young people , both born with silver spoons in their mouths , to live on what he can earn . " Having made this clear , Mrs. Lenhardt tried to calm down , and Mildred tried to calm down . She said this was the first she had heard of it , and she would have to talk with Veda before she could say what she thought . But as Mrs. Lenhardt politely agreed that this was an excellent idea , Mildred began to have a suspicion that the whole truth had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should Veda feel this way about it , and your boy not ? " " Mrs. Pierce , I 'm not a mind reader . " Mrs. Lenhardt spoke angrily , the color appearing in her cheeks . Then she added : " But let me tell you one thing . If you , or that girl , or anybody , employ any more tricks , trying to blackmailmy boy into  --  " " Trying to  --  what ? " Mildred 's voice cracked like a whip , and for a few moments Mrs. Lenhardt did n't speak . Apparently she knew she had said too much , and was trying to be discreet . Her effort was unsuccessful . When her nostrils had dilated and closed several times , she exploded : " You may as well understand here and now , Mrs. Pierce , that I shall prevent this marriage . I shall prevent it in any way that I can , and by legal means , if necessary . " The way she said " necess'ry " had a very ominous sound to it . By now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mildred , and she became calm , cold , calculating . Looking up , she saw Arline at her dusting again , her ears bigger than ever . Calling her , she told her to straighten the chairs at the next table , and as she approached , turned pleasantly to Mrs. Lenhardt . " I beg your pardon . For the moment I was n't listening . " Mrs. Lenhardt 's voice rose to a scream . " I say if there are any more threats , any more officers at my door , any more of these tricks she 's been playing  --  I shall have her arrested , I shall have her prosecuted for blackmail , I shall not hesitate for one moment , for I 've quite reached the limit of my patience ! " Mrs. Lenhardt , after panting a moment , got up and swept out Mildred looked at Arline . " Did you hear what she said ? " " I was n't listening , Mrs. Pierce "  | " I asked if you heard what she said . " Arline studied Mildred for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to blackmail her boy into marrying her and if she kept it up she 'd have the law on her . " " " Remember that , in case I need you . " " Yes 'm . " That night Mildred did n't go to Laguna or to Beverly . She stayed home , tramping around , tortured by the fear that Arline had probably told everybody in the restaurant by now , by uncertaintyas to what dreadful mess Veda had got herself into , by a sick , nauseating , physical jealousy that she could n't fight down . At eleven , she went to her room and lay down , pulling a blanket over her but not taking off her clothes . Around one , when Veda 's car zipped up the drive , she took no chances on a locked door , but jumped up and met Veda in the kitchen . " Mother ! . . . My , how you startled me ! " " I 'm sorry , darling . But I have to talk to you . Something has happened . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . " Mildred went to the den , relieved that she had smelled no liquor . In a minute or two Veda came in , sat down , lit a cigarette , yawned . " Personally , I find pictures a bore , do n't you ? At least Nelson Eddy pictures . Still , I suppose its toot his fault , for it is n't how lie sings but what he sings . And I suppose be has nothing to do with how dreadfully long they are . " Miserably , Mildred tried to think how to begin . In a low , timid voice , she said : " A Mrs. Lenhardt was in to see me today . A Mrs. John Lenhardt . " " Oh , really ? " " She says you 're engaged to marry her son , or have some idea you want to marry him , or  --  something . " " She 's quite talkative . What else ? " " She opposes it . " In spite of her effort , Mildred had been unable to get started . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about ? What does it all mean ? " Veda smoked reflectively a few moments , then said , in her clear , suave way : " Well , it would be going too far to say it was my idea that Sam and I get married . After the big rush they gave me , with Pa breaking his neck to get me a screen test and Ma having me over morning , noon and night , and Sonny Boyp198phoning me , and writing me , and wiring me that if I did n't marry him he 'd end his young life  --  you might say it was a conspiracy . Certainly I said nothing about it , or even thought about it , until it seemed advisable . " " What do you mean , advisable ? " " Well Mother , he was certainly very sweet , or seemed so at any rate , and they were most encouraging , and I had n't exactly been happy since  --  Hannen died . And Elaine did have a nice little apartment . And I was certainly most indiscreet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole attitude changed , alas . And here I am , holding the bag . One might almost say I was a bit of a sap . " If there was any pain , any tragic overtone , to this recital , it was not audible to the ordinary ear . It betrayed regret over folly , perhaps a little self-pity , but all of a casual kind . Mildred , however , was n't interested in such subtleties . She had reached a point where she had to know one stark , basic fact . Sitting beside Veda , clutching her hand , she said : " Darling , I have to ask you something . I have to , I have to . Are you  --  going to have a baby ? " " Yes Mother , I 'm afraid I am . " For a second the jealousy was so overwhelming that Mildred actually was afraid she would vomit . But then Veda looked at her in a pretty , contrite way , as one who had sinned but is sure of forgiveness , and dropped her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , and a tingle went through Mildred . She gathered Veda to her bosom , held her tight , patted her , cried a little . " Why did n't you tell me ? " " I was afraid . " " Of me ? Of Mother ? " " No , no ! Of the suffering it would bring you . Darling Mother , do n't you know I ca n't bear to see you unhappy ? " Mildred closed her eyes for a moment , to savor this sweet blandishment . Then , remembering , she asked : " What did she mean about officers ? " " You mean police ? " " I guess so . At her door . " " My , that is funny . " Veda sat up , lit another cigarette , and laughed in a silvery , ironical way . " From what I 've learned of the young man since this happened , I 'd say that any girl from Central Casting , per-p 199 Imps all eight thousand of them for that matter , could have sent officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , that 's really funny , when you stop to think about it , is n't it ? " Hoping for more saccharine remarks , Mildred asked Veda if she 'd like to sleep with her , " just for tonight , " but Veda said it was something she 'd have to face alone , and went to her room . All through the night , Mildred kept waking with the jealousy gnawing at her . In the morning , she went to the Glendale restaurant and called Bert . Dispensing with Tommy , she went down to Mrs. Biederhof 's corner and picked him up . Then , starting for the hills , she started to talk . She put in everything that seemed relevant , beginning with Mr. Hannen 's hemorrhage , and emphasizingVeda 's forbodings about it . When she got to Mr. Treviso , Bert 's face darkened , and he exclaimed at the " rottenness " of a dirty wop that would treat a young girl that way . Then , finding the going more difficult , Mildred told about Elaine , the drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hardly able to speak any more , or to drive , she told about Mr. Lenhardt . Then , trying to tell about her talk with Veda , she broke down completely , and blurted : " Bert ! She 's going to have a baby ! She 's in a family way ! " Bert 's grip tightened on her ann . " I fold it ! Stop this goddam car . I got to  --  get some place where I can move around . " She stopped , and pulled to one side , on Foothill Boulevard . He got out , began tramping up and down beside the car . Then he began to curse . He said goddam it , he was going to kill that son of a bitch if it was the last thing he did on earth . He said he was going to kill him if they hung him for it and his soul rotted in hell . With still more frightful oaths , he went into full particulars as to where he was going to buy the gun , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say when he had him face to face , and how he would let him have it . Mildred watched the preposterous little figure striding up and down , and a fierce , glowing pride in him began to warm her . Even his curses gave her a queer , morbid satisfaction . But after a while she said : " Get in , Bert . " He climbed in beside her , held his face in his hands , and for a moment she thought he was going to weep . When he did n't , she started the car and said : " I know you 'd kill him , Bert . I know you would , and I glory in you for it . I love you for it . " She tookp 200 his hand , and gripped it , and tears came to her eyes , for he had reached her own great pain , somehow , and by his ferocity , eased it . " But  --  that would n't do Veda any good . If he 's dead , that 's not getting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are we going to do ? " Gagging over her words , Mildred presently broached the subject of an operation . It was something she knew little about , and hated , not only on account of its physical aspect , but because it went counter to every instinct in her wholly feminine nature . Bert cut her off with a gesture . " Mildred , girls die in that operation . They die . And we 're not going to let her die . We lost one , and that 's enough . By God , I 'll say she 's not going to have any operation , not to make it easy for a dirty little rat that took advantage of her and now wants to do a run-out . " Bert now turned toward Mildred , his eyes flashing . " He 's going to marry her , that 's what he 's going to do . After he 's given her child a name , then he can do his run-out . Ile better do a run-out , and do it fast , before I catch up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I give a damn , but before he does , he 'll march up beside her and say I do . ' I 'll see to that . " " It 's the only thing , Bert . " Mildred drove along , and presently had a hollow feeling they were right back where they started . It was all very well to say the boy had to marry Veda , but how could they make him do it ? Suddenly she burst out : " Bert , I 'm going to get a lawyer . " " It 's just what I 've been thinking . " " You and I , we ca n't do a thing . Precious time is going by , and something has to be done . And the first thing is to get that lawyer . " " O.K. And get him quick . " When Mildred got home , Veda was just getting up . Closing the door , she addressed the tousled girl in the green kimono . " I told your father . We had a talk . He agrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call up Wally Burgan . " " Mother , I think that 's an excellent idea . . . . As a matter of fact , I 've already called him up . " " You  --  what ? " Veda spoke sleepily , and a little impatiently . " Mother , ca n't you see that I 'm trying to arrange things myself , without putting you to all kinds of trouble about it ? I 've been trying to spare you . I want to make things easy for you . " p 201 Mildred blinked , tried to adjust herself to this astounding revelation . Wally arrived around three . Mildred brought him to the privacyof the den , then went and sent Letty on an errand that would take her all afternoon . When she got back to the den , Veda was there , in a simple little blue frock that had cost Mildred$75 , and Wally was looking at the pictures of Bert attendingthe banquets . He said things certainly did look familiar , and casually got down to business . He said he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what he figured it was . " The kid comes into dough on his twenty-first birthday , that 's the main thing . How much I do n't exactly know , but it 's well up in six figures . He 's got to inherit . There 's no way the mother , or the stepfather , or any of them can juggle the books to keep him out of it , and once he dies , whoever is married to him at the time cuts in for her share of the community property . That 's what this is all about , and it 's all it 's all about . That 's why they 're breaking their ' necks to head it off . It 's got nothing to do with their being too young , or loving each other , or not loving each other , or the different ways they 've been brought up , or any of the stuff that mother has been dishing out . It 's nothing but the do-re-mi  --  the old army game . " When Wally stopped Mildred drew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little : " Wally , I 'm not interested in whether he inherits , or how much he inherits , or anything of that kind . So long as I 'm here , I do n't think Veda will be in want . But a situation has been created . It 's a terrible situation for Veda , and the only thing that boy can do about it is marry her . If he 's a decent boy , he 'll do the right thing on his own initiative , regardlessof what his family says . If he 's not , he 'll have to be made . Wally , that woman had a great deal to say that I have n't told Veda , but that I have witnesses to substantiate  --  about law , and what she 'll do , and other things . I 'll go just as far as she will . If it 's the only ' y , I want that boy arrested  --  and you can tell him he can be very glad it 's only the police he has to face , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough . " " Have n't we got laws ? " " He 's skipped . " Wally shot a glance at Veda , who considered a few moments , then said : " I think you 'd better tell her . " p 202 " You see , Mildred , just happens we already thought of that . Two , three days , maybe a week ago , I took Veda over to the Sheriff 's office and had her swear out a warrant for Sam . No statutory rape , nothing unpleasant like that . Just a little morals charge , and same afternoon , couple of the boys went over to serve it . He was n't there . And so far  --  " " So that 's what she meant by officers ' Veda stirred uneasily under Mildred 's accusing eyes . " Well Mother , if you 're talking about what I said last night , I did n't know at that time that any officers had actually been there . " Mildred turned on Wally . " It does seem to me that on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , I should have been the first one you would have talked to about it . Why the very idea , of legal steps being taken without my knowing anything whateverabout it ! " " Now just hold your horses a minute . " Wally 's eyes became very cold , and he got up and marched up and down in front of Mildred before he went on . " One thing you might consider : I 've got a little thing called legal ethics to consider . Sure , I 'd have been willing to talk to you . We 've talked plenty before , have n't we ? But when my client makes an express stipuation that I not talk to you , why  --  " When Mildred turned , Veda was ready . " Mother , it 's about time you got it through your head that after all , I , and not you , am the main figure in this little situation , as you call it . I 'm not proud of it . I readily admit it 's my own fault , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act on that assumption , when I try to relieve you of responsibility , when I try to save you unhappiness , it does seem to me you could give me credit for some kind of decent motives , instead of going off the handle in this idiotic way . " I never in all my life  --  ! " " Now , Mother , nobody was asking any help from you , and as Wally has taken my case as a great favor to me , I think the least you can do is let him tell us what to do , as I imagine he knows much more about such things than you do . " As Mildred subsided , a little frightened at Veda 's tone , Wally resumed in the casual way he had begun : " Well , so far as his doing anything goes , I 'd say the next move was up to them . Way I look at it , we 've taken Round 1 . When we got out that warrant , that showed we meant business . On a morals charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the girl  --  after that it 's dead open and 203 shut . When they got him under cover quick , that shows they knew what they 're up against . And what they 're up against is tough . So long as that warrant is out against him , he dare not come back to the state of California , he ca n't go back to college , or even use his right name . Course there 's a couple of other things we might do , like suing the mother , but then we 're in the newspapers , and that 's not so good . I 'd say leave it like it is . Sooner or later they got to lead to us , and the more we act like we do n't care , the prettier we 're sitting . " " But Wally ! " Mildred 's voice was a despairing wail . " Wally ! Time is going on ! Days are passing , and look at this girl 's condition ! We ca n't wait ! We  --  " " I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone ended the discussion , but all that day and all that night Mildred fretted , and by next morning she had worked herself into a rage . When Tommy reported , at noon , she had him drive her over to Mrs. Lenhardt 's , to " have it out with her . " But as they whirled up the drive , she saw the house man that had let her in , that morning long ago , talking to the driver of a deliverytruck . She knew perfectly well he would remember her , and she called shrilly to Tommy to drive on , she had changed her mind . As the car rolled around the loop in front of the house , she leaned far back , so she would n't be seen . Then she had Tommy drive her to Ida 's , and telephoned Bert . Leaving Tommy in Beverly , she again picked up Bert at Mrs. Biederhof 's corner , and headed up to the hills . Bert listened , and began shaking his head . " Gee Mildred , I wish you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm telling you , I do n't like the guy , and I do n't like the way he does business . Telling him to step on the gas is like  --  well , he 's been liquidatingPierce Homes for eight years now , has n't he ? And they 're not liquidated yet . He 's not trying to get Veda married . He 's just running up a bill . " They rode along , each trying to to find that boy , is n't it ? Is n't that right ? " " That 's it ! Instead of  --  " " What this needs is a private detective . " A hot , savage thrill shot through Mildred . At last she knew they were getting somewhere . Excitedly they talked about it , and then Bert told her to get him to a drugstore , or any placep 204 where he could get to a phone book . She stopped in San Fernando , and Bert hopped out before the car stopped rolling . He was back in a minute or two , a slip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with phone numbers and addresses . I 'd say let 's go first to this Simons agency . I 've heard of it , for one thing , and it 's right there in Hollywood , not too far away . " The Simons Detective Agency was located in a small , onestoryoffice on Vine Street , and Mr. Simons turned out to be a friendly little man with bushy black hair . He listened attentively as Bert stated the problem , and refrained from asking embarrassingquestions . Then he tilted back in his chair and said he saw no particular difficulty . He got jobs of this sort all the time , and on most of them was able to show results . However , since time seemed to be of the essence , there would be certain expenses , and he would have to ask for an advance . " I 'd have to have two fifty before I can start at all . First , to get the young man 's picture and other information I 'll need , I 'll have to put an operative to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I 'll have to offer a reward , and  --  " " Reward ? " Mildred suddenly had visions of a horrible picture tacked up in post offices . " Oh , do n't worry , Mrs. Pierce . " Mr. Simons seemed to divine her fear . " This is all strictly confidential , and nobody 'll know anything . Just the same , we work through our connections , and they 're not in business for their health . I 'd say , on this , a $50 reward should be ample . Then there 's the printing of our fliers , and the pay of a girl to address a couple thousand envelopes , and ... " Bert suggested that half the advance should be paid now , the other half when the boy was found , but Mr. Simons shook his head . " This is all money I 'll have to pay out before I can start at all . Mind , I have n't said anything yet about my services . Of course , other places may do it cheaper , and you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always say , the cheaper the slower in this business  --  and , the riskier . " Mildred wrote the check . On the way home , both of them applauded themselves handsomely for what they had done , and agreed it should be between themselves , with nothing said to Wally or Veda until they had something to " lay on the line , " as Bert put it . So for several days Mildred was ducking into phone booths and talking in guarded tones to Mr. Simons . Then one afternoon he told her to come in . She picked up Bert , and to-p 205 gether they drove to the little frame office . Mr. Simons was all smiles . " We had a little luck . Of course it was n't really luck . In this business , you ca n't be too thorough . We found out that when he left town , the young man was driving one of his stepfather 's cars , and just because I was able to put that information on the flier , now we 've got something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just let me have the check while the girl is typing out the address for you ... " Mildred wrote a check for $125 , mainly for " services . " Mr. Simons put a card in her hand , with an address on it . " That 's a dude ranch near Winslow , Ariz . The young man is using his right name , and I do n't think you 'll have any trouble locating him . " Driving back , they stared at one of Mr. Simons 's fliers , bearing the weak , handsome face of the boy they had chosen for a sonin-law . Then , nervously , they discussed what was to be done , and came to the conclusion , in Bert 's phrase , that they had to " go through with it . " When Mildred dropped him off , they agreed that the time had come to get action out of Wally , and rather grimly Mildred drove home . Going to the kitchen , she sent Letty on another protracted errand . Then , when the girl had gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she told what she had done , and read him the address furnished by Mr. Simons . He said hey wait a minute , till he got a pencil . Then lie made her repeat the address slowly , and then said : " Swell . Say , that 's a help . It 's a good thing to have , just in case . " " What do you mean , in case ? " " In case they get tough . " " Are n't you calling the sheriff 's office ? " " No use going off half-cocked . We 've got them right where we want them , and as I said before , our play is to make them come to us . Just let it ride , and  --  " " Wally , I want that boy arrested . " " Mildred , why do n't you let me  --  " Mildred slammed up the receiver and jumped up , her eyes blazing , her hat slightly askew . When she turned to dash out , Veda was at the door . At once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's not even trying to do anything . I 've told him where that boy is . I had a detective find out  --  and still he does nothing . Well that 's the last he 'll hear frorn me ! I 'm going over to the sheriff 's office myself ! " Quivering with her high , virtuous resolve , Mildred charged for the door . She collided with Veda , who seemed to have movedp 206 to block her path . Then her wrist was caught in a grip like steel , and slowly , mercilessly , she was forced back , until she plunged down on the sofa . " You 'll do nothing of the kind . " " Let go of me ! What are you pushing me for ? What do you mean I 'll do nothing of the kind ? " " If you go to the sheriff 's office , they 'll bring young Mr. Forresterback . And if they bring him back , he 'll want to marry me , and that does n't happen to suit me . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sneaked into town , twice , and a beautifultime I had of it , getting him to be a nice boy and stay where Mamma put him . He 's quite crazy about me . I saw to that . But as for matrimony , I beg to be excused . I 'd much rather have the money . " Mildred took off her hat , and stared at the cold , beautiful creature who had sat down opposite her , and who was now yawning , as though the whole subject were a bit of a bore . The events of the last few days began ticking themselves off in her mind , particularly the strange relationship that had sprung up , between Veda and Wally . The squint appeared , and her face grew hard . " Now I know what that woman meant by blackmail . You 're just trying to shake her down , shake the whole family down , for money . You 're not pregnant , at all . " " Mother , at this stage it 's a matter of opinion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes glinted as she spoke , and Mildred wanted to back down , to avoid one of those scenes from which she always emerged beaten , humiliated , and hurt . But something was swellingwithin her , something that began in the sick jealousy of a few nights before , something that felt as though it might presentlychoke her . Her voice shook as she spoke . " How could you do such a thing ? If you had loved the boy , I would n't have a word to say . So long as I thought you had loved him , I did n't have a word to say , not one word to blame you . To love is a woman 's right , and when you do , I hope you give everything you have , brimming over . But just to pretend you loved him , to lead him on , to get money out of him  --  how could you do it ? " " Merely following in my mother 's footsteps . " " What did you say ? " " Oh , stop being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there 's the date of my birth . Figure it out for yourself . The only difference is that you were a little younger at that time thanp 207 I am now  --  a month or two anyway . I suppose it runs in families . " " Why do you think I married your father ? " " I rather imagine he married you . If you mean why you got yourself knocked up , I suppose you did it for the same reason I did  --  for the money . " " What money ? " " Mother , in another minute I 'll be getting annoyed . Of course he has no money now , but at the time he was quite rich , and I 'm sure you knew it . When the money was gone you kicked him out . And when you divorced him , and he was so down and out that the Biederhof had to keep him , you quite generously stripped him of the only thing he had left , meaning this lovely , incomparable , palatial hovel that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mine . He wanted to do his share , to contribute something for you and Ray . And it was all covered with mortgages , that he could n't even have paid the interest on , let alone  --  " " At any rate , you took it . " By now , Mildred had sensed that Veda 's boredom was pure affectation . Actually she was enjoying the unhappiness she inflicted , and had probably rehearsed her main points in advance . This , ordinarily , would have been enough to make Mildred back down , seek a reconciliation , but this feeling within kept goading her . After trying to keep quiet , she lashed out : " But why ? Why- will you tell me that ? Do n't I give you everything that money can buy ? Is there one single thing I ever denied you ? If there was something you wanted , could n't you have come to me for it , instead of resorting to  --  blackmail . Because that woman was right ! That 's all it is ! Blackmail ! Blackmail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mildred felt first frightened , then coldly brave , as the feeling within drove her on . Veda puffed her cigarette , reflected , and asked : " Are you sure you want to know ? " " I dare you to tell me ! " " Well , since you ask , with enough money , I can get away from you , you poor , half-witted mope . From you , and your pie-wagon , and your chickens , and your waffles , and your kitchens , and everything that smells of grease . And from this shack , that you blackmailed out of my father with your threats about the Biederhof , and its neat little two-car garage , and its lousy furniture . And from Glendale , and its dollar days , and its furniture fac-p 208 tories , and its women that wear uniforms and its men that wear smocks . From every rotten , stinking thing that even reminds me of the place  --  or you . " " I see . " Mildred got up and put on her hat . " Well it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to , when I did . Because I can tell you right now , if you had gone through with this , or even tried to go through with it , you 'd have been out of here a little sooner than you expected . " She headed for the door , but Veda was there first . Mildred laughed , and tore up the card Mr. Simons had given her . " Oh you need n't worry that I 'll go to the sheriff 's office now . It 'll be a long time before they find out from me where the boy is hiding , or you do either . " Again she started for the door , but Veda did n't move . Mildred backed off and sat down . If Veda thought she would break , she was mistaken . Mildred sat motionless , her face hard , cold , and implacable . After a long time the silence was shattered by the phone . Veda jumped for it . After four or five brief , cryptic monosyllables , she hung up , turned to Mildred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may be interested to know that they 're ready to settle . " " Are you ? " " I 'm meeting them at his office . " " Then get out . Now . " " I 'll decide that . And I 'll decide when . " " You 'll get your things out of this house right now or you 'll find them in the middle of Pierce Drive when you come back . " Veda screamed curses at Mildred , but presently she got it through her head that this time , for some reason , was different from all other times . She went out , backed her car down to the kitchen door , began carrying out her things , and packing them in the luggage carrier . Mildred sat quite still , and when she heard Veda drive off she was consumed by a fury so cold that it almost seemed as though she felt nothing at all . It did n't occur to her that she was acting less like a mother than like a lover who has unexpectedly discovered an act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months after this that Bert called up to invite her to the broadcast . For her , it had been a dismal six months . She had found out soon enough where Veda was staying . It was in one of the small , swank apartment houses on Franklin Avenue , in Hollywood . Every fibre of her being had wanted to pay a visit there , to take back what she had said , to reestablish things as they had been , or try to . But when this thought entered her mind , or rather shot through her heart like a hot arrow , she set her face as if it had been cast in metal , and not once did she even drive past Veda 's door . And yet , even in her loneliness , her relation with Veda was developing , twisting her painfully , like some sort of cancer . She discovered rye , and in the boozy dreams of her daily rest , she pictured Veda as going from bad to worse , as hungering and mending threadbare finery , until she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This view of the future was somewhat obscured by the circumstancethat Mildred did n't know exactly how much Veda had obtained from the Lenhardts , and thus could n't calculate , with any degree of accuracy , when destitution was likely to strike . But Bert contributed a thought that assisted drama , if not truth . Bert , having tried unsuccessfully to stand on his rights as a father to bluff information out of Wally , and having threatened even to " hold up the settlement " unless full data were furnished , had learned only that his consent was not needed for a settlement ; all the Lenhardts wanted was a release from Veda , a signed letter denying promises , intimidation , or pregnancy . But the episode had left him with a lower opinion of Wally 's honesty than he had had before , if that were possible , and he hatched the theory that " Wally would have every damned cent of it before the year was out , did n't make a bit of difference what they paid , or what he got , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized , and pictured the cheated Veda , not only as cold , hungry , and in rags , but as horribly bruised in spirit , creeping to the strong , silent mother who could cope with Wally or any-p 210 body else . When the scene materialized almost daily before her eyes , with a hundred little variations and embellishments , she always experienced the same brief ecstasy as she lifted the weepingVeda into her arms , patted her , inhaled the fragrance of the soft , coppery hair , and bestowed love , understanding , and forgiveness . One slight incongruity she overlooked : Veda in real life , rarely wept . At Bert 's mention of a broadcast it took her a moment or two to collect her wits . " What broadcast ? " " Why , Veda . " " You mean she 's playing on the air ? " " Singing , the way I get it . " " Veda ? Singing ? " " Maybe I better come over . " By the time he got there , she was a-tremble with excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there , sure enough , was Veda 's picture , with the news that " the popular singer will be heard tonight at 8.30 , on the Hank Somerville ( Snack-0-Ham ) program . " Bert had seen the Examiner , but had n't seen the Times , and together they looked at the picture , and commented on how lovely Veda looked . When Mildred wanted to know how long this had been going on , meaning the singing , Bert said quickly you could n't prove it by him , as though to disclaimparticipation in secrets that had been withheld from Mildred . Then he added that the way he got it , Veda had been on the air quite a lot already , on the little afternoon programs that nobody paid any attention to , and that was how she 'd got this chance on a big national hook-up . Mildred got the rye she had been sipping , poured two more drinks , and Bert revealed that his invitation had really been Mrs. Biederhof 's idea . " She figured it meant a lot more to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came to call you up . " " It was certainly nice of her . " " She 's a real friend . " " You mean we 'll go to the studio ? " " That 's it . It 's going out from the NBC studio right here in Hollywood , and we 'll be able to see it and hear it . " " Do n't we have to have tickets ? " " . . . I got a couple . " " How ? " " It 's taken care of . " " From Veda ? "   " Never mind . I got ' em . " At the look on Mildred 's face , Bert quickly crossed over , took her hand . " Now what 's the use of acting like that ? Yes , she called me up , and the tickets are there waiting for me . And she 'll call you up , of course she will . But why would she be calling you in the morning , like she did me ? She knows you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's probably been busy , I hear they run those singers ragged , rehearsing them , the day of a broadcast . O.K. , they 've got her there , where she ca n't get to a phone or anything , but that 's not her fault . She 'll call . Of course she will . " " Oh no . She wo n't call me . " As Bert did n't know the full details of Veda 's departure from home , his optimism was understandable . He evidently regarded the point as of small importance , for he began to talk amiably , sipping his rye . He said it certainly went to show that the kid had stuff in her all right , to get a spot like that with a big jazz band , and nobody giving her any help but herself . He said he knew how Mildred felt , but she was certainly going to regret it afterwards if she let a little thing like this stand in the way of being there at the kid 's first big chance . Because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these big name bands , they 're in the money , and no mistake about it . And sometimes , if they had the right hot licks on their first broadcast , they hit the big time overnight . Mildred let a wan , pitying smile play over her face . If Veda had got there , she said , it was certainly all right with her . Just the same , it certainly seemed funny , the difference between what Veda might have been , and what she was . " Just a year or two ago , it was a pleasure to listen to her . She played all the classical composers , the very best . Her friends were of the best . They were n't my friends , but they were of the best . Her mind was on higher things . And then , after Mr. Hannen died , I do n't know what got into her . She began going around with cheap , awful people . She met that boy . She let Wally Burgan poison her mind against me . And now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  from Beethoven to Hank Somerville , in a little over a year No , I do n't want to go to the broadcast . It would make me too sad . " Truth to tell , Mildred had no such critical prejudice against Mr. Somerville , or the torch canon , as her remarks might indicate . If Veda had called her up , she would have been only toop 212 glad to regard this as " the first move , " and to have gone adoringly to the broadcast . But when Veda called Bert , and did n't call her , she was sick , and her sickness involved a bad case of sour-grapes poisoning : so far as she was concerned , torch was the lowest conceivableform of human endeavor . Also , she hated the idea that Bert might go without her . She insisted that he take Mrs. Biederhof , but he got the point , and miserably mumbled that he guessed he would n't go . Then suddenly she asked what advantagethere was in going to the studio . He could hear it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hear it there ? He could have his dinner , a nice big steak if he wanted it , and then later she would have Mrs. Gessler put the radio on the veranda , and he could hear Veda without going to a lot of useless trouble . At the mention of steak , poor Bert perked up , and said he 'd often wanted to see her place at Laguna . She said come right along , she 'd be starting as soon as Tommy brought the car . He said O.K. , and went legging it home to change into clothes suitable to a high-class place . At Laguna , Mildred was indifferent to the impending event , and had little to say to the girls , the cooks , and the customers who kept telling her about Veda 's picture in the paper , and askingher if she was n't excited that her daughter was on the air . Bert , however , was n't so reticent . While his steak was on the fire , he held court in the bar , and told all and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were what it took , the kid had them . When the hour drew near , and Mrs. Gessler plugged in the big radio on the veranda , he had an audience of a dozen around him , and extra chairs had to be brought . Two or three were young girls , there were two married couples , and the rest were men . Mildred had intended to pay no attention to the affair at all , but along toward 8.25 , curiosity got the better of her . With Mrs. Gessler she went outside , and there was a lively jumping up to give her a seat . One or two men were left perched on the rail . The first hint she got that Veda 's performance might not be quite the torchy affair that Bert had taken for granted came when Mr. Somerville , early in the program , affected to faint , and had to be revived , somewhat noisily , by members of his band . The broadcast had started in the usual way , with the Krazy Kaydetsgiving the midshipmen 's siren yell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted his audience , p 213 and then he introduced Veda . When he asked if Veda Pierce was her real name , and she said it was , he wanted to know if her voice was unduly piercing . At this the kaydets rang a ship 's gong , and Veda said no , but her scream was , as he 'd find out if he made any more such remarks . The studio audience laughed , and the group on the veranda laughed , especially Bert , who slapped his thigh . A man in a blue coat , sitting on the rail , noddedapprovingly . " She put that one across all right . " Then Mr. Somerville asked Veda what she was going to sing . She said the Polonaise from Mignon , and that was when he fainted . While the kaydets were working over him , and the studio audience was laughing , and the ship 's gong was clanging , Bert leaned to the man in the blue coat . " What 's it about ? " " Big operatic aria . The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads . " " Oh , now I get it . " " Do n't worry . They 'll knock it over . " Mildred , who found the comedy quite disgusting , paid no attention . Then the kaydets crashed into the introduction . Then Veda started to sing . Then a chill , wholly unexpected , shot up Mildred 's backbone . The music was unfamiliar to her , and Veda was singing in some foreign language that she did n't understand . But the voice itself was so warm , rich , and vibrant that she began to fight off the effect it had on her . While she was trying to get readjusted to her surprise , Veda came to a little spray of rippling notes and stooped . The man in the blue coat set his drink on a table and said : " Hey , hey , hey ! " After a bar or two by the orchestra , Veda came in again , and another chill shot up Mildred 's back . Then , as cold prickly waves kept sweeping over her , she really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice oppressed her : it seemed unfairthat this girl , instead of being chastened by adversity , was up there , in front of the whole world , singing , and without any help from her . Somehow , all the emotional assumptions of the last few months were stood on their head , and Mildred felt mean and petty for reacting as she did , and yet she could n't help it . Soon Veda stopped , the music changed slightly , and the man in the blue coat sipped his drink . " O.K. so far . Now for the flyingtrapeze . " When Veda started again , Mildred gripped her chair in sheer panic . It seemed impossible that anybody could dare such dizzy heights of sound , could even attempt such vocal gymnastics , without making some slip , some dreadful error thatP 214 would land the whole thing in ruin . But Veda made no slip . She went on and on , while the man in the blue coat jumped down from the rail , squatted by the machine , and forgot his drink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bert and the others watched him with some sort of fascinated expectancy . At the end , when the last , incredibly high note floated over the finale of the orchestra , he looked up at Mildred . " Jesus Christ , did you hear it ? Did you  --  " But Mildred did n't wait for him to finish . She got up abruptly and walked down toward Mrs. Gessler 's flowers , waving back Bert and Mrs. Gessler , who called after her , and started to follow . Pushing through the bushes , she reached the bluff overlooking the sea , and stood there , lacing her fingers together , screwing her lips into a thin , relentless line . This , she needed nobody to tell her , was no descent from Beethoven to Hank Somerville , no cheap venture into torch . It was the coming true of all she had dreamed for Veda , all she had believed in , worked for , dedicated her life to . The only difference was that the dream that had come true was a thousand times rosier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by whatever means she would have to take , she knew she would have to get Veda back . This resolve remained hot in her mouth , but back of it , like a fishbone across her throat , was her determination that Veda , and not herself , would have to make the first move . She tried to put this aside , and drove to Veda 's one morning with every intention of stopping , ringing the bell , and going in . But as she approached the little white apartment house , she hurriedly told Tommy to drive on without stopping , and leaned far back in the car to avoid being seen , as she had done that morning at Mrs. Lenhardt 's . She felt hot-faced and silly , and the next time she decided to visit Veda she drove the car herself , and went alone . Again she went by without stopping . Then she took to driving past Veda 's at night , and peeping , hoping to see her . Once she did see her , and quickly pulled in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , she slipped out of the car and crept to the window . Veda was at a piano , playing . Then suddenlythe miracle voice was everywhere , going through glass and masonry as though they were air . Mildred waited , a-tremble , until the song was finished , then ran back to her car and drove off.  | But the broadcasts continued , and Mildred 's feeling of being left out in the cold increased , until it became intolerable . Veda did n't appear again on the Snack-O-Ham program . To Mildred 's astonishment , her regular spot on the air was Wednesdays , at 3.15 , as part of the Treviso Hour , offered by star pupils of the same Carlo Treviso who had once closed the piano so summarilyover her knuckles . And then , after listening to two of these broadcasts , and drinking in Veda 's singing and everything the announcer said about her , Mildred had an idea . By making use of Mr. Treviso , she could compel Veda to call her on the phone , to thank her for favors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost anything might happen . So presently she was in the same old anteroom , with the same old vocalizing going on inside , and her temper growing hotter and hotter . But when Mr. Treviso finally received her , she had herself under what she thought was perfect control . As he gave no sign of recognition , she recalled herself to him , and he looked at her sharply , then bowed , but otherwise made no comment . She then made her little speech , which sounded stiff , and no doubt was supposed to sound stiff . " Mr. Treviso , I 've come on a matter that I shall have to ask you to keep confidential , and when I tell you the reason , I 'm sure you 'll be only too glad to do so . My daughter Veda , I believe , is now taking lessons from you . Now for reasons best known to herself , she prefers to have nothing to do with me at the moment , and far be it from me to intrudeon her life , or press her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty toward her , with regard to the expenses of her musical education . It was I , Mr. Treviso , who was responsible for her studying music in a serious way , and even though she elects to live apart from me , I still feel that her music is my responsibility , and in the future , without saying anything to her , without saying one word to her , Mr. Treviso , I 'd like you to send your bills to me , and not to her . I hope you do n't find my request unreasonable . " Mr. Treviso had seated himself , and listened with his deathmasksmile , and for some moments he studied his fingernails attentively . Then he stood up . " Am ver ' sorry , Madame , but dees is subject w'ich I can not discuss wit ' you . " " Well I 'm very sorry too , Mr. Treviso , but I 'm afraid you 'll have to discuss it with me . Veda is my daughter , and  --  " " Madame , you excuse me , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door , and opened it , sp 216 though Mildred were the queen of Naples . Nothing happened . Mildred sat there , and crossed her still shapely legs in a way that said plainly she had no intention of going until she had finished her business . He frowned , looked at his watch . " Yes , himportant engagement . You excuse me ? Please . " He went out , then , and Mildred was left alone . After a few minutes , the little fat woman came in , found a piece of music , sat down at the piano , and began to play it . She played it loud , and then played it again , and again , and each time she played it was louder and still louder . That went on perhaps a half hour , and Mildred still sat there . Then Mr. Treviso came back and motioned the little fat woman out of the room . He strode up and down for a few minutes , frowning hard , then went over and closed the door . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a long , bony forefinger , " Why you want dees girl back ? Tell me that ? " " Mr. Treviso , you mistake my motives .  --  I  --  " " No mistake , no mistake at all . I tell Veda , well you pretty lucky , kid , somebody else pay a bill now . And she , she got no idea at all , hey ? Do n't know who to call up , say thanks , sure is swell , how you like to see me again , hey ? " " Well that was n't my idea , Mr. Treviso , but I 'm sure , if Veda did happen to guess who was paying the bill , and called up about it , I could find it in my heart to  --  " " Listen , you . I tell you one t'ing . Is make no difference to me who pay . But I say to you : you want to ' ear dees girl sing , you buy a ticket . You pay a buck . You pay two bucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay eight eighty , but do n't you try to ' ear dees girl free . Because maybe cost you more than a whole Metropolitan Grand Opera is wort ' . " " This is not a question of money . " " No by God , sure is not . You go to a zoo , hey ? See little snake ? Is come from India , is all red , yellow , black , ver ' pretty little snake . You take ' ome , hey ? Make little pet , like puppy dog ? Noyou got more sense . I tell you , is same wit ' dees Veda . You buy ticket , you look at a little snake , but you no take home . No . " " Are you insinuating that my daughter is a snake ? " " No  --  is a coloratura soprano , is much worse . A little snake , lovemamma , do what papa tells , maybe , but a coloratura soprano , love nobody but own goddam self . Is son-bitch-bast ' , worsethan all a snake in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As Mildred sat blinking , trying to get adjusted to the whollyp 217 unexpected turn the interview had taken , Mr. Treviso took anotherturn around the room , then apparently became more interested in his subject than he had intended . He sat down now , his eyes shining with that Latin glare that had so upset her on her first visit . Tapping her knee again , he said : " Dees girl , she is coloratura , inside , outside , all over . " " " What is a coloratura soprano ? " " Madame , is special fancy breed , like blue Persian cat . Come once in a lifetime , sing all a trill , a staccato ha-ha-ha , a cadenza , a tough stuff  --  " " Oh , now I understand . " " Cost like ' ell . If is real coloratura , bring more dough to a grand opera house than big wop tenor . And dees girl , is coloratura , even a bones is coloratura . First , must know all a rich pipple . No rich , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Nice maybe , but must be rich . All coloratura , they got , ' ow you say ?  --  da gimmies . Always take , never give . O.K. , you spend plenty money on dees girl , what she do for you ? " " She 's a mere child . She ca n't be expected to  --  " " So  --  she do nothing for you . Look . " Mr. Treviso tapped Mildred 's knee again , grinned . " She even twiddle la valiere all a coloratura , sit back like a duchess twiddle a la valiere . " And lie gave a startling imitation of Veda , sitting haughtily erect in her chair , twiddling the ornament of her neck chain . " She 's done that since she was a little girl ! " " Yes  --  is a funny part .

" Mildred , who had listened to this eulogy as one might listen to soul-nourishing organ music , came to herself with a start , and murmured : " She 's a wonderful girl . " " No  --  is a wonderful singer . " As she looked at him , hurt and puzzled , Mr. Treviso stepped nearer , to make his meaning clear . " Da girl is lousy . She is a bitch . Da singer  --  is not . " This seemed to be all , and Mildred got up . " Well  --  we 're all entitled to our opinion , but I would like it , if you do n't mind , if you 'd send your bills hereafter to me  --  " " No , Madame . " " Have you any particular objection ?

She ask me , I say you not been ' ere at all  --  any'ow , I no see . " Mildred was so shaken up by Mr. Treviso 's last revelation , that she was n't capable of plans , schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She felt as if she had been caught in some shameful act , and drove herself with work so as not to think about it . But later that night , things began to sort themselves out into little piles . She found some consolation in the certitude that at least Veda would n't know what she had done . And then , presently , she sat up in bed , hot excitement pulsing all through her . At last she knew , from that disclosure of Veda 's desire to get back with the rich Pasadena people , how she would get her , how she would make even a coloratura come grovelling , on her knees . She would get Veda through Monty . P220WITHOUT MAKING any special effort to do so , Mildred had kept track of Monty these last three years , had even had a glimpse of him once or twice , on her way hack and forth to Laguna . He was exactly where she had left him : in the ancestral house , trying to sell it . The place , no more saleable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephant , had a run-down look to it by now . The grass was yellow , from lack of water ; across the lawn , in a bleary row , were half a dozen agents ' signs ; the iron dogs looked rusty ; and one of the pillars , out front , had evidently been hit by a truck , for there was a big chip out of it , with raw brick showing through . However , though she knew where to find him , Mildred did n't communicate with Monty at once . She went to the bank , opened her safe-desposit box , and made an accurate list of her bonds . She looked at her balances , both checking and savings . She went to Bullock 's , bought a new dress , new hat , new shoes . The dress was simple , but it was dark blue , and she felt it slenderized her . The hat was big , dark , and soft . She then called an agent , and without giving her name , got the latest asking price on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just how exact her plan was it would be hard to say . She was wholly feminine , and it seems to be part of the feminine mind that it can tack indefinitely upwind , each tack bearing off at a vague angle , and yet all bearing inexorably on the buoy . Perhaps she herself did n't quite know how many tacks she would have to make to reach the buoy , which was Veda , not Monty . At any rate , she now sent him a telegram , saying she wanted help in picking a house in Pasadena , and would he be good enough to call her around eight that night , " at the Pie Wagon ? " She was a little nervous that evening , but was as casual when Monty called as though there were no buoys in her life whatever . She explained chattily that she simply had to move soon , to live in some place that was more centrally located ; that Pasadena would he most convenient , and would he be good enough top 221 ride around with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got around to picking out a house ? He seemed a little puzzled , but said he would do what he could , and how about calling some agents , so they could ride around too , and show what they had ? Agents , she said , were exactly what she wanted to avoid . She could see them any time . What she wanted was to get the feel of a town that he knew a great deal better than she did , perhaps peep at a few places , and get some idea where she wanted to live . Monty said he had no car at the moment , and could she pick him up ? She said that was exactly what she wanted to do , and how about the next afternoon at three ? She dressed with a great deal of care the next afternoon , and when she surveyed herself in the long mirror , it was with quite a little satisfaction . For the last few months , perhaps as a result of the woe that had weighted her down , she had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly held her belly in quite nicely . The new dress had a smart , casual look to it , and was of a becoming length , so that enough of her legs showed , but not too much . The big hat gave her a slightly flirty , Merry Widow look . The shoes flattered her feet , and set off the whole costume with a bit of zip . She tried a silver fox fur , decided it was right , and wore it . In truth , although she did n't look quite as she imagined she did , she looked rattier interesting . She looked like a successful woman of business , with the remains of a rather seductive figure , a face of little distinction but considerable authority , a credit to that curious world that had produced her , Southern California . It did n't suit her plans to have Tommy along , so she stepped into the car herself and was pleased at the expert way she handled it . She went zipping over the bridge to Pasadena , from the traffic circle down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansion , Monty was sitting on the steps waiting for her . She went roaring up the drive , stopped in front of him , said " Well ! " and held out her hand . He took it , then jumped in beside her . Both were smiling , but a little pang shot through her at the change in him . He wore slacks , but they were cheap and unpressed . His bald spot was bigger : it had grown from the size of a quarter to the size of a big silver dollar . He was thin and lined , and had a brooding , hang-dog look that was very different from the jaunty air he had once had . As to how she looked , he made no comment , and indeed indulged in no personaltalk of any kind . He said he wanted her to see a place in p| 222 the Oak Knoll section , quite decent , very reasonable . Would she care to drive over there ? She said she 'd love to . By the time they had looked at places in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Pasadena section , and nothing quite suited her , he seemed a little irritated . From the glib way he quoted prices , she knew he had called up the agents , in spite of her telling him not to , and that he would get a little split if she bought . But she paid no attention , and around five headed for Orange Grove Avenue again , to bring him home . Rather curtly , he said good-bye , and got out , and started inside , and then , as a sort of afterthought , stood waiting for her to leave . Pensively , she sat at the wheel , looking at the house , and then she cut the motor , got out , and stood looking at it . Then she let a noisy sigh escape her , and said , " Beautiful , beautiful ! " " It could be , with a little money spent on it . " " Yes , that 's what I mean . . . . What do they want for it , Monty ? " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . All the places he had taken her to had been quoted around $10,000 : evidently it had n't occurred to him she could possibly be interested in this formidable pile . He stared , then said : " Year before last , seventy-five flat  --  and it 's worth every cent of it . Las+ ' year , fifty . This year , thirty , subject to a lien of thirty-one huh . dred for unpaid taxes  --  all together around thirty-three thousand dollars . " Mildred 's information was that it could be had for twenty -- eight and a half , plus the tax lien , and she noted ironically that he was a little better salesman than she had given him credit for . However , all she said was : " Beautiful , beautiful ! " Then she went to the door , and peeped in . It had changed somewhat since her last visit , that night in the rain . All the furniture , all the paintings , all the rugs , all the dust cloths , were gone , and in places the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her shoes gritted on the floor , and she could hear gritty , hesitant echoes of her steps . Keeping up a sort of self-conscious commentary , he led her through the first floor , then up to the second . Presently they were in his own quarters , the same servants ' apartment he had occupied before . The servants ' furniture was gone , but in its place were a few oak pieces with leather seats , which she identified at once as having come from the shack at Lake Arrowhead . She sat down , sighed , and said it certainly would feel good to rest for a few minutes. p 223 He quickly offered tea , and when she accepted he disappeared into the bedroom . Then he came out and asked : " Or would you like something stronger ? I have the heel of a bottle here . " " I 'd love something stronger . " " I 'm out of ice and seltzer , but  --  " " I prefer it straight . " " Since when ? " " Oh I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Scotch , which to her taste was quite different from rye . As she gagged over the first sip he laughed and said : " Oh you have n't changed much . On liquor I 'd say you were about the same . " " That 's what you think . " He checked this lapse into the personal , and resumed his praise of the house . She said : " Well you do n't have to sell me . I 'm already sold , if wanting it is all . And you do n't have to sit over there yelling at me , as though I was deaf . There 's room over here , is n't there ? " Looking a little foolish , he crossed to the settee she was occupying . She took his little finger , tweaked it . " You have n't even asked me how I am , yet . " " How are you ? " " Fine . " " Then that 's that . " " How are you ? " " Fine . " " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . He drew it away and said : " You know , gentlemen in my circumstances do n't have a great deal of romance in their lives . If you keep this up , you might find yourself the victim of some ravening brute , and you would n't like that , would you ? " " Oh , being ravened is n't so bad . " He looked away quickly and said : " I think we 'll talk about the house . " " One thing bothers me about it . " " What 's that ? " " If I should buy it , as I 'm half a mind to , where would you be ? Would there be a brute ravening around somewhere , or would I have it all to myself ? " " It would be all yours . " " I see . " p 224 She reached again for his finger . He pulled it away before she caught it , looking annoyed . Then , rather roughly , he put his arm around her . " Is that what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But she had barely settled back when he took his arm away . " I made a slight mistake about the price of this house . To you , it 's twenty-nine thousand , five hundred , and eighty . That 'll square up a little debt I owe you , of five hundred and twenty dollars , that 's been bothering me for quite some time . " " You owe me a debt ? " " If you try , I think you can recall it . " He looked quite wolfish , and she said " Booh ! " He laughed , took her in his arms , touched the zipper on the front of her dress . Some little time went by , one half of him , no doubt , telling him to let the zipper alone , the other half telling him it would be ever so pleasant to give it a little pull . Then she felt her dress loosen , as the zipper began to slide . Then she felt herself being carried . Then she felt herself , with suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the same tobacco-laden blankets , from which she had kicked the beach bag , years before , at Lake Arrowhead . " Damn it , your legs are still immoral . " " You think they 're bowed ? " " Stop waving them around . " " I asked you " No . " " Around dark , she grew sentimentally weepy . " Monty , I could n't live here without you . I could n't , that 's all . " Monty lay still , and smoked a long time . Then , in a queer , shaky voice he said : " I always said you 'd make some guy a fine wife if you did n't live in Glendale . " " Are you asking me to marry you ? " " If you move to Pasadena , yes . " " You mean if I buy this house . " " No  --  it 's about three times as much house as you need , and I do n't insist on it . But I will not live in Glendale . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tried to be kittenish , but while he put his arm around her he continued sombre , and he did n't look atp 225 her . Presently it occurred to her that he might be hungry , and she asked if he would like to ride to Laguna with her , and have dinner . He thought a moment , then laughed . " You 'd better go to Laguna alone , and I 'll open myself another can of beans . My clothes , at the moment , are n't quite suitable to dining out . Unless , of course , you want me to put on a dinner coat . That mockeryof elegance happens to be all I have left . " " We never had that New Year 's party yet . " " Oh did n't we ? " " And we do n't have to go to Laguna . . . . I love you in a dinner coat , Monty . If you 'll put one on , and then drive over with me while I put on my mockery of elegance , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is , if we really are engaged . " " All right , let 's do it . " She spanked him on his lean rump , hustled him out of bed , and jumped out after him . She was quite charming in such moments , when she took absurd liberties with him , and for one flash his face lit up , and he kissed her before they started to dress . But he was sombre again when they arrived at her house . She put out whiskey , ice , and seltzer , and he made himself a drink . While she was dressing he wandered restlessly about , and then put his head in her bedroom and asked if he could put a telegram on her phone . " I 'd like Mother to know . " " Would you like to talk to her ? " " It 's a Philadelphia call . " " Well my goodness , you act as if it was Europe . Certainly call her up . And you can tell her it 's all settled about the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and twenty dollars , or whatever it was . If that 's what 's been worrying her , tell her not to worry any more . " " I 'd certainly love to . " He went to the den , and she went on with her dressing . The blue evening dress was long since outmoded , but she had another one , a black one , that she liked very well , and she had just laid it out when he appeared at the door . " She wants to speak to you . " " Who ? " " Mother . " " In spite of success , money , and long experience at dealing with people , a qualm shot through Mildred as she sat down to the phone , in a hastily-donned kimono , to talk to this woman sheswp 226 had never met . But when she picked up the receiver and uttered a quavery hello , the cultured voice that spoke to her was friendshipitself . " Mrs. Pierce ? " " Yes , Mrs. Beragon . " " Or perhaps you 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love it , Mrs. Beragon . " " I just wanted to say that Monty has told me about your plan to be married , and I think it splendid . I 've never met you , but from all I 've heard , from so many , many people , I always felt you were the one wife for Monty , and I secretly hoped , as mothers often do , that one day it might come to pass . " " Well that 's terribly nice of you , Mrs. Beragon . Did Monty tell you about the house ? " " He did , and I do want you to be happy there , and I 'm sure you will . Monty is so attached to it , and he tells me you like it too  --  and that 's a big step toward happiness is n't it ? " " I would certainly think so . And I do hope that some time you 'll pay us a visit there , and , and  --  " " I 'll be delighted . And how is darling Veda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing , you know . " " My dear , I heard her , and I was astonished  --  not really of course , because I always felt that Veda had big things in her . But even allowing for all that , she quite bowled me over . You have a very gifted daughter , Mildred . " " I 'm certainly glad you think so , Mrs. Beragon . " " You 'll remember me to her ? " " I certainly will , Mrs. Beragon . " She hung up flushed , beaming , sure she had done very well , but Monty 's face had such an odd look that she asked : " What 's the matter ? " " Where is Veda ? " " She  --  took an apartment by herself , a few months ago . It bothered her to have all the neighbors listening while she vocal-ized . " " That must have been messy . " " It was  --  terrible . " Within a week , the Beragon mansion looked as though it had been hit by bombs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervision of Monty , was to restore what had been a large but pleasant house to what it had been before it was transformed into a small but hideous mansion . To that end the p| 227 porticoes were torn off , the iron dogs removed , the palm trees grubbed up , so the original grove of live oaks was left as it had been , without tropical incongruities . What remained , after all this hacking , was so much reduced in size that Mildred suddenly began to feel some sense of identity with it . When the place as it would be began to emerge from the scaffolding , when the yellow paint had been burned off with torches and replaced with a soft white wash , when green shutters were in place , when a small , friendly entrance had taken the place of the former Monticello effect , she began to fall in love with it , and could hardly wait until it was finished . Her delight increased when Monty judged the exterior sufficiently advanced to proceed with the interior , and its furnishings . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the $520 , or Glendale , or anything of a personal kind . But he seemed bent on pleasing Mildred , and it constantly surprised her , the way he was able to translate her ideas into paint , wood , and plaster . About all she was able to tell him was that she " liked maple , " but with this single bone as a clue , he reconstructed her whole taste with surprising expertness . He did away with paper , and had the walls done in delicate kalsomine . The rugs he bought in solid colors , rather light , so the house took on a warm , informal look . For the upholstered furniture he chose bright , inexpensive coverings , enunciating a theory to Mildred : " In whatever pertains to comfort , shoot the works . A room wont look comfortable unless it is comfortable , and comfort costs money . But on whatever pertains to show , to decoration alone , be a little modest . People will really like you better if you are n't so damned rich . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much that she went around meditating about it , and thinking how she could apply it to her restaurants . He asked permission to hang some of the paintings of his ancestors , as well as a few other small pictures that had been stored for him by friends . However , he did n't give undue prominenceto these things . In what was no longer a drawing room , but a big living room , he found place for a collection of Mildred Pierce , Inc. : Mildred 's first menu , her first announcements , a photograph of the Glendale restaurant , a snapshot of Mildred in the white uniform , other things that she did n't even know he had saved  --  all enlarged several times , all effectively framed , all hung together , so as to form a little exhibit . At first , she had been self - conscious about them , and was afraid he had hung them therep 228 just to please her . But when she said something to this effect , he put down his hammer and wire , looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compassionate little pat . " Sit down a minute , and take a lesson in interior decorating . " " I love lessons in decorating . " " Do you know the best room I was ever in ? " " No , I do n't . " " It 's that den of yours , or Bert 's rather , over in Glendale . Everythingin that room meant something to that guy . Those banquets , those foolish-looking blueprints of houses that will never be built , are a part of him . They do things to you . That 's why the room is good . And do you know the worst room I was ever in ? " " Go on , I 'm learning . " " It 's that living room of yours , right in the same house . Not one thing in it  --  until the piano came in , but that 's recent  --  ever meant a thing to you , or him , or anybody . It 's just a room , I supposethe most horrible thing in the world . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't have to be furnished with Picasso paintings , or Sheraton suites , or Oriental rugs , or Chinese pottery . But it does have to be furnished with things that mean something to you . If they 're just phonies , bought in a hurry to fill up , it 'll look like that living room over there , or the way this lawn looked when my father got through showing how much money he had . .. Let 's have this place the way we want it . If you do n't like the Pie Wagon corner , I do . " " I love it : " " Then it stays . " From then on , Mildred began to feel proud of the house and happy about it , and particularly relished the last hectic week , when hammer , saw , phone bell , and vacuum cleaner mingled their separate songs into one lovely cacophony of preparation . She moved Letty over , with a room of her own , and Tommy , with a room and a private bath . She engaged , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had worked for Mrs. Beragon before " es went kaput , " as Kurt put it . She drove to Phoenix , with Monty , and got married . For a week after this quiet courthouse ceremony she was almost frantic . She had addressed Veda 's announcement herself , and the papers were full of the nuptials , with pictures of herself and lengthy accounts of her career , and pictures of Monty and just as lengthy accounts of his career . But there was no call fromp 229 Veda , no visit , no telegram , no note . Many people dropped in : friends of Monty 's , mostly , who treated her very pleasantly , and did n't seem offended when she had to excuse herself , in the afternoonat any rate , to go to work . Bert called , with all wishes for her happiness , and sincere praise for Monty , whom he described as a " thoroughbred . " She was surprised to learn that he was living with Mom and Mr. Pierce . Mrs. Biederhof 's husband havingstruck oil in Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always supposed Mrs. Biederhof a widow , and so apparently had Bert . Yet the call that Mildred hoped for did n't come . Monty , well aware by now that a situation of some sort existed with regard to Veda , rather pointedly did n't notice her mood , or make any inquiries about it . And then one night at Laguna , Mrs. Gessler appeared around eight in a bright red evening dress , and almost peremptorily told Mildred to close the place , as she herself was invited out . Mildredwas annoyed , and her temper did n't improve when Archie took off his regimentals at nine sharp , and left within a minute or two . She was in a gloomy irritable humor going home , and several times called Tommy down for driving too fast . Until she was at the door of her new house , she did n't notice that a great many cars seemed to be parked out front , and even then they made no particular impression on her . Tommy , instead of openingfor her , rang the bell twice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth to say something peevish about people who forget their keys , when lights went up all over the first floor , and the door , as though of its own accord , swung slowly open , wide open . Then , from somewhere within , a voice , the only voice in the world to Mildred , began to sing . After a long time Mildred heard a piano , realized Veda was singing the Bridal Chorus from Lohengrin . " Here comes the bride , " sang Veda , but " comes " was hardly the word . Mildred floated in , seeing faces , flowers , dinner coats , paper hats , hearing laughter , applause , greetings , as things in a dream . When Veda , still singing , came over , took her in her arms , and kissed her , it was almost more than she could stand , and she stumbled hurriedly out , and let Monty take her upstairs , on the pretext that she must put on a suitable dress for the occasion . A few years before , Mildred would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her commonplaceness , her upbringing , her sense of inferiority in the presence of " society people , " would have combined to make her acutely miserable , completelyp 230 incompetent . Tonight , however , she was a completely charming hostess and guest of honor , rolled into one . In the black evening dress , she was everywhere , seeing that people had what they wanted , seeing that Archie , who presided in the kitchen , and Kurt , Frieda , and Letty , assisted by Arline and Sigrid , from the Pie Wagon itself , kept things going smoothly . Most of the guests were Pasadena people , friends of Veda 's and Monty 's , but her waitress training , plus her years as Mildred Pierce , Inc. , stood her in good stead now . She had acquired a memory like a filing cabinet , and had everybody 's name as soon as she heard it , causingeven Monty to look at her with sincere admiration . But she was pleased that he had asked such few friends as she had : Mrs. Gessler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome in his dinner goat , and helped with the drinks , and turned music for Mr. Treviso when Veda , importuned by everybody , graciously consented to sing . Mildred wanted to cry when people began to leave , and then discovered that the evening had hardly begun . The best part came when she , and Veda , and Monty sat around in the small library , across from the big living room , and decided that Veda should spend the night , and talked . Then Monty , not at all reverentin the presence of art , said : " Well goddam it , how did you get to be a singer ? When I discovered you , practically pulled you out of the gutter , you were a pianist , or supposed to be . Then I no sooner turn my back than you turn into some kind of a yodeler . " " Well goddam it , it was an accident . " " Then report . " " I was at the Philharmonic . " " Yes , I 've been there . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfinished . And afterwards I was walking across the park , to my car , and I was humming it . And ahead of me I could see him walking along  --  " " Who ? " " Treviso . " " Oh yes , the Neapolitan Stokowski . " " So I had plenty of reason for not walking to meet the honorablesignor , because I 'd played for him once , and he was n't at all appreciative . So I slowed down , to let him get ahead . But then he stopped , and turned around , and looked , and then he came over to me , and said : Was that you singing ? ' Well , I havep 231 to explain that I was n't so proud of my singing just about that time . I used to sing Hannen 's songs for him , whenever he wrote one , but he used to kid me about it , because I sang full chest , and sounded exactly like a man . He called me the Glendale Baritone . Well , that was Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take any kidding off Treviso . So I told him it did n't concern him whether I was singing or not , but he grabbed me by the arm , and said it concerned him very much , and Inc . Thin he took a card from his pocket , and a pen , and ran under a light , and wrote his address on it , and handed it to me , and told me to be there the next day at four o'clock , that it was important . So that night I had it out with myself . I knew , when he handed me the card , that he had no recollection he had ever seen me before , so there was no question of kidding . But  --  did I want to unlock that door again or not ? " " What door ? " Monty was puzzled , but Mildred knew which door , even beforeVeda went on : " Of music . I 'd driven a knife through its heart , and locked it up , and thrown the key away , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him tomorrow , at four o'clock . And do you know why I went ? " Veda was dead serious now , and looking at them both as though to make sure they got things straight . " It was because once he had told me the truth . I , had hated him for it , the way he had closed the piano in front of me without saying a word , but it was his way of telling me , and it was the truth . So I thought maybe he was telling me the truth now . So 1 went . And for a week he worked on me , to get me to sing like a woman , and then it began to come the right way , and I could hear what he had heard that night out there in the park . And than he began to tell me how important it was that I become a musician . 1 had the voice , he said , if I could master music . And he gave me the names of this one and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and piano , and I do n't know what-all . " " Oh yeah ? " " Yeah , and did I get my revenge , for that day when he closed the piano on me . I asked him if there was a little sight-reading he wanted done , and he handed me the Inflammatus from Rossini'sStabat Mater . Well nuts . I went through that like a hot knife through butter , and he began to get excited . Then I asked him if he had a little job of arranging he wanted done , and then I told him about Charlie , and reminded him I 'd been in therep 232 before . Well , if he 'd hit gold in Death Valley he could n't have acted more like a goof . He went all over me with instruments , little wooden hammers that he used on my knuckles , and caliper things that went over my nose , and gadgets with lights on them that went down my throat . Why he even  --  " Veda made curious , prodding motions just above her midriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or not , he even dug his fingers into the Dairy . Well ! I did n't exactly know what to think , or do . " " Veda could make a very funny face when she wanted to , and Monty started to laugh . In spite of herself , so did Mildred . Veda went on : " But it turned out he was n't interested in love . He was interested in meat . He said it enriched the tone . " " The what ? " Monty 's voice rose to a whoop as he said this , and the next thing they knew , the three of them were howling with laughter , howling at Veda 's Dairy as they had howled at Mrs. Biederhof 's bosom , that first night , many years before . When Mildred went to bed her stomach hurt from laughter , her heart ached from happiness . Then she remembered that while Veda had kissed her , that first moment when she had entered the house , she still had n't kissed Veda . She tiptoed into the room she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she had knelt so many times in Glendale , took the lovely creature in her arms and kissed her , hard , on the mouth . She did n't want to go . She wanted to stay , to blow through the holes in Veda 's pajamas . And when she got back to her room she could n't bear it that Monty should be there . She wanted to be alone , to let these little laughs come bubbling out of her , to think about Veda . Monty agreed to withdraw to the tackroom as he called the place where he stored his saddles , bridles , and furniture from the shack , with complete good humor  --  with more good humor , perhaps , than a husband should show , at such a request . P233MILDRED NOW entered the days of her apotheosis . War was crashing in Europe , but she knew little of it , and cared less . She was drunk with the glory of the Valhalla she had entered : the house among the oaks , where dwelt the girl with the coppery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirers , teachers , coaches , agents , and thieves who made life so exciting . For the first time , Mildred became acquainted with theatres , opera houses , broadcasting studios , and such places , and learned somethingof the heartbreak they can hold . There was , for example , the time Veda sang in a local performance of Traviata , given at the Philharmonic under the direction of Mr. Treviso . She had just had the delightful sensation of beholding Veda alone on stage for at least ten minutes , and at the intermission went out into the lobby , to drink in the awestruck comment of the public . To her furious surprise , a voice behind her , a man 's voice , with effeminate intonation , began : " So that 's La Pierce , radios gift to the lyric muse . Well , there 's no use telling me , you ca n't raise singers in Glendale . Why , the girl 's simply nauseating . She gargles it over her tonsils in that horrible California way , she 's off pitch half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her routine , after Alfredo went off ? She had no routine . She planted one heel on that dime , locked both hands in front of her , and just stayed there until ... " While Mildred 's temples throbbed with helpless rage , the voice moved off somewhere , and another one began , off to one side : " Well , I hope you all paid close attention to the critique of operaticacting , by one who knows nothing about it  --  somebody ought to tell that fag that the whole test of operatic acting is how few motions they have to make , to put across what they 're trying to deliver . John Charles Thomas , can he make them wait till he 's ready to shoot it ! And Flagstad , how to be an animated Statue of Liberty ! And Scotti , I guess he was nauseating . He was the greatest of them all . Do you know how many gestures he made when he sang the Pagliacci Prologue ? One , just one . When heP 234 came to the F  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat  --  he raised his hand , and turned it over , palm upward . That was all , and he made you cry . . . . This kid , if I ever saw one right out of that can , she 's it . So she locked her hands in front of her , did she ? Listen , when she folded one sweet little paw into the other sweet little paw , and tilted that pan at a fortyfivedegree angle , and began to warble about the delicious agony of love  --  I saw Scotti 's little girl . My throat came up in my mouth . Take it from me , this one 's in the money , or will be soon . Well , hell , it 's what you pay for , is n't it ? " Then Mildred wanted to run after the first man , and stick out her tongue at him , and laugh . Some things , to be sure , she tried not to think about , such as her relations with Monty . Since the night Veda came home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or anybody near her . She continued to sleep alone , and he , for a few days , to sleep in the tackroom . Then she assigneda bedroom to him , with bath , dressing room , and phone extension . The only time the subject of their relations was ever discussed between them was when she suggested that he pick out his furniture himself ; on that occasion , she had tried to be facetious , and said something about their being " middle-aged . " To her great relief , he quickly agreed , and looked away , and started talking about something else . From then on , he was host to the numerous guests , master of the house , escort to Mildred when she went to hear Veda sing  --  but he was not her husband . She felt better about it when she noted that much of his former gaiety had returned . In a way , she had played him a trick . If , as a result , he was enjoying himself , that was the way she wanted it .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as for example the row with Mr. Levinson , her agent . Mr. Levinson had signed Veda to a radio contract singing for Pleasant , a new brand of mentholated cigarettes that was just coming on the market . For her weekly broadcast Veda received $500 , and was " sewed , " as Mr. Levinson put it , for a year , meaning that during this period she could do no broadcasting for anybody else . Mildredthought $500 a week a fabulous stipend for so little work , and so apparently did Veda , until Monty came home one day with Mr. Hobey , who was president of Consolidated Foods , and had decided to spend part of his year in Pasadena . They were in high spirits , for they had been in college together : it was Mr. Hobey 's mountainous , shapeless form that reminded MildredP 235 that- Monty was now in his forties . And Mr. Hobey met Veda . And Mr. Hobey heard Veda sing . And Mr. Hobey experienced a slight lapse of the senses , apparently , for he offered her $2,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mention in 25% of Consol 's national advertising , if she would only sing for Sunbake , a new vitamin bread he was promoting . Veda , now sewed , was unable to accept , and for some days after that her profanity , her studied , cruel insults to Mr. Levinson , her raving at all hours of the day and night , her monomania on this one subject , were a little more than even Mildred could put up with amiably . But while Mildred was trying to think what to do , Mr. Levinson revealed an unexpected ability to deal with such situations himself . He bided his time , waited until a Sunday afternoon , when highballs were being served on the lawn out back , and Veda chose to bring up the subject again , in front of Mildred , Monty , Mr. Hobey , and Mr. Treviso . A pasty , pudgy little man in his late twenties , he lit a cigar , and listened with half-closed eyes . Then he said : " O.K. , ya dirdy li'l rat . Now s'pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now s'pose ya say ya sorry . " " I ? Apologize ? to you ? " " I got a offer for ya . " , . : : What offer ? " " Bowl . " " Then , accept . . . . If the terms are suitable . " Mr. Levinson evidently noted how hard it was for Veda to say anything at all about terms , for the Hollywood Bowl is singer 's heaven . He smiled a little , and said : " Not so fast , baby . It 's kind of a double offer . They 'll take Pierce or they 'll take Opie Lucas  --  they leave it to me . I handle ya both , and Opie , she do n't cuss me out . She 's nice . " " A contralto 's no draw . " " Contralto gets it if you do n't ' pologize . " There was silence in the sunlight , while Veda 's mouth became thick and wet , and Mr. Treviso smiled at a dancing mote , looking like a very benign cadaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O.K. , Levy . I apologize . " Mr. Levinson got up , walked over to Veda , and slapped her hard , on the cheek . Monty and Mr. Hobey jumped up , but Mr. Levinson paid no attention . His soft , pendulous lower lip hanging down , he spoke softly to Veda : " What ya say now ? " Veda 's face turned pink , then crimson , then scarlet , and her light blue eyes stared at Mr. Levinson with a fixity **32;7129;TOOLONG we was fightin ' or how many we had lost . I 've heared them say that even Old Rosey himself did n't know jest what had happened when he rode back into town next day , and did n't know that Thomas was still standin ' like a rock . And if Old Rosey did n't know no more than this about hit , what could a common soldier know ? We fought back and forth across that cedar thicket fer two days , and thar was times when you would be right up on top of them before you even knowed that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' went  --  the bloodiest fightin ' that was ever knowed , until that cedar thicket was soaked red with blood , and thar was hardly a place left in thar where a sparrer could have perched . And as I say , we heared ' em fightin ' out upon our right at ten o'clock , and then the fightin ' came our way . I heared later that this fightin ' started when the Yanks come down to the Creek and run into a bunch of Forrest 's men and drove ' em back . And then they had hit back and forth until they got drove back themselves , and that 's the way we had hit all day long . We 'd attack and then they 'd throw us back , then they 'd attack and we 'd beat them off . And that was the way hit went from mornin ' till night . We piled up there upon their left : they mowed us down with canister and grape until the very grass was soakin ' with our blood , but we kept comin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day  --  I was in four of ' em myself . We fought back and forth across that wood until there was n't a piece of hit as big as the palm of your hand we had n't fought on . We busted through their right at two-thirty in the afternoon and got way over past the Widder Glenn 's , where Rosey had his quarters , and beat ' em back until we got the whole way cross the Lafayette Road and took possession of the road . And then they drove us out again . And we kept comin ' on , and both sides were still at hit after darkness fell. pI01We fought back and forth across that road all day with first one side and then the tother holdin ' hit until that road hitself was soaked in blood . They called that road the Bloody Lane , and that was jest the name fer hit . We kept fightin ' fer an hour or more after hit had gotten dark , and you could see the rifles flashin ' in the woods , but then hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night was somethin ' to remember and to marvel at as long as you live . The fight had set the wood afire in places , and you could see the smoke and flames and hear the screamin ' and the hollerin ' of the wounded until hit made your blood run cold . We got as many as we could  --  but some we did n't even try to git  --  we jest let ' em lay . It was an awful thing to hear . I reckon many a wounded man was jest left to die or burn to death because we could n't git ' em out . You could see the nurses and the stretcher-bearers movin ' through the woods , and each side huntin ' fer hits dead . You could see them movin ' in the smoke an ' flames , an ' you could see the dead men layin ' there as thick as wheat , with their corpselikefaces an ' black powder on their lips , an ' a little bit of moonlightcomin ' through the trees , and all of hit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . But we had other work to do . All through the night we could hear the Yanks a-choppin ' and a-thrashin ' round , and we knowed that they was fellin ' trees to block us when we went fer them next mornin ' . Fer we knowed the fight was only jest begun . We figgered that we 'd had the best of hit , but we knowed no one had won the battle yet . We knowed the second day would beat the first . Jim knowed hit too . Poor Jim , he did n't sleep that night he never seed the man upon the horse that night  --  he jest sat there , a-grippin ' his knees and starin ' , and a-sayin ' : " Lord God , Lord God , when will hit ever end ? " pIO2 Then mornin ' came at last . This time we knowed jest where we was and what hit was we had to do . Our line was fixed by that time . Bragg knowed at last where Rosey had his line , and Rosey knowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides , till mornin ' came . Hit was a foggy mornin ' with mist upon the ground . Around ten o'clock when the mist began to rise , we got the order and we went chargin ' through the wood again . We knowed the fight was goin ' to be upon the right upon our right , that is  --  on Rosey 's left . And we knowed that Thomas was in charge of Rosey 's left . And we all knowed that hit was easier to crack a flint rock with your teeth than to make old Thomas budge . But we went after him , and I tell you what , that was a fight ! The first day 's fight had been like playin ' marbles when compared to this . We hit old Thomas on his left at half-past ten , and Breckenridgecame sweepin ' round and turned old Thomas 's flank and came in at his back , and then we had hit hot and heavy . Old Thomas whupped his men around like he would crack a rawhidewhup and drove Breckenridge back around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him before you knowed the first attackwas over . The fight went ragin ' down the flank , down to the center of Old Rosey 's army and back and forth across the left , and all up and down old Thomas 's line . We 'd hit him right and left and in the middle , and he 'd come back at us and throw us back again . And we went ragin ' back and forth thar like two bloody lions with that cedar thicket so tore up , so bloody and so thick with dead by that time , that hit looked as if all hell had broken loose in thar . Rosey kept a-whuppin ' men around off of his right , to help old Thomas on the left to stave us off . And then we 'd hit old Thomas left of center and we 'd bang him in the middle andp103we 'd hit him on his left again , and he 'd whup those Yankees back and forth off of the right into his flanks and middle as we went fer him , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' back and forth like kangaroos , and in the end that was the thing that cooked their goose . The worst fightin ' had been on the left , on Thomas 's line , but to hold us thar they 'd thinned their right out and had failed to close in on the center of their line . And at two o'clock that afternoonwhen Longstreet seed the gap in Wood 's position on the right , he took five brigades of us and poured us through . That whupped them . That broke their line and smashed their whole right all to smithereens . We went after them like a pack of ragin ' devils . We killed ' em and we took ' em by the thousands , and those we did n't kill and take right thar went streamin ' back across the Ridge as if all hell was at their heels . That was a rout if ever I heared tell of one ! They went streamin ' back across the Ridge  --  hit was each man fer himself and the devil take the hindmost . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he tried to check ' em , face ' em round , and get ' em to come on again  --  hit was like tryin ' to swim the Mississippi upstream on a boneyard mule ! They swept him back with them as if he 'd been a wooden chip . They went streamin ' into Rossvillelike the rag-tag of creation  --  the worst whupped army that you ever seed , and Old Rosey was along with all the rest ! He knowed hit was all up with him , or thought he knowed hit , for everybody told him the Army of the Cumberland had been blowed to smithereens and that hit was a general rout . And Old Rosey turned and rode to Chattanooga , and he was a beaten man . I 've heared tell that when he rode up to his headquarters thar in Chattanooga they had to help him from his horse , and that he walked into the house all dazed and fuddled-like , like he never knowed what had happened to him  --  and that he jest sat thar struck dumb and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . And then the news was brought to him that Thomas was still thar upon the field and would n't budge . Old Thomas stayed thar like a rock . We 'd smashed the right , we 'd sent it flyin ' back across the Ridge , the whole Yankee right was broken into bits and streamin ' back to Rossville for dear life . Then we bent old Thomas back upon his left . We thought we had him , he 'd have to leave the field or else surrender . But old Thomas turned and fell back along the Ridge and put his back against the wall thar , and he would n't budge . Longstreet pulled us back at three o'clock when we had broken up the right and sent them streamin ' back across the Ridge . We thought that hit was over then . We moved back stumblin ' like men walkin ' in a dream . And I turned to Jim  --  I put my arm around him , and I said : " Jim , what did I say ? I knowed hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end ! " I never even knowed if he heard me . He went stumblin ' on beside me with his face as white as paper and his lips black with the powder of the cartridgebite , mumblin ' and mutterin ' to himself like someone talkin ' in a dream . And we fell back to position , and they told us all to rest . And we leaned thar on our rifles like men who hardly knowed if they had come out of that hell alive or dead . " Oh Jim , we 've got ' em and this is the end ! " I said . He leaned thar swayin ' on his rifle , starin ' through the wood . He jest leaned and swayed thar , and he never said a word , and those great eyes of his a-burnin ' through the wood . " Jim , do n't you hear me ? "  --  and I shook him by the arm . " Hit 's over , man ! We 've licked ' em and the fight is over !  --  Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on the right , the word camepI05down the line again , and Jim  --  poor Jim !  --  he raised his head and listened , and " Oh God ! " he said , " we 've got to go again ! " Well , hit was true . The word had come that Thomas had lined up upon the Ridge , and we had to go fer him again . After that I never exactly knowed what happened . Hit was like fightin ' in a bloody dream  --  like doin ' somethin ' in a nightmare  --  only the nightmare was like death and hell . Longstreet threw us up that hill five times , I think , before darkness came . We 'd charge up to the very muzzles of their guns , and they 'd mow us down like grass , and we 'd come stumblin ' back  --  or what was left of us  --  and form again at the foot of the hill , and then come on again . We 'd charge right up the Ridge and drive ' em through the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd come back again and we 'd brain each other with the butt end of our guns . Then they 'd throw us back and we 'd re-form and come on after ' em again . The last charge happened jest at dark . We came along and stripped the ammunition off the dead  --  we took hit from the wounded  --  we had nothin ' left ourselves . Then we hit the first line  --  and we drove them back . We hit the second and swept over them . We were goin ' up to take the third and last  --  they waited till they saw the color of our eyes before they let us have hit . Hit was like a river of red-hot lead had poured down on us : the line melted thar like snow . Jim stumbled and spun round as if somethin ' had whupped him like a top . He fell right toward me , with his eyes wide open and the blood a-pourin ' from his mouth . I took one look at him and then stepped over him like he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of now  --  no more to reach  --  except that line . We reached hit and they let us have hit  --  and we stumbled back . And yet we knowed that we had won a victory . That 's what they told us later  --  and we knowed hit must be so because whenpIo6 daybreak came next mornin ' the Yankees was all gone . They had all retreated into town , and we was left there by the Creek at Chickamauga in possession of the field . I do n't know how many men got killed . I do n't know which side lost the most . I only know you could have walked across the dead men without settin ' foot upon the ground . I only know that cedar thicket which had been so dense and thick two days before you could 've drove a knife into hit and hit would of stuck , had been so shot to pieces that you could 've looked in thar on Monday mornin ' with your naked eye and seed a black snake run a hundred yards away . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the Yankees we may have killed . The Generals on both sides can figger all that out to suit themselves . But I know that when that fight was over you could have looked in thar and wondered how a hummin ' bird could 've flown through that cedar thicket and come out alive . And yet that happened , yes , and something more than hummin ' birds  --  fer men came out , alive . And on that Monday mornin ' , when I went back up the Ridge to where Jim lay , thar just beside him on a little torn piece of bough , I heard a redbird sing . I turned Jim over and got his watch , his pocket-knife , and what few papers and belongin 's that he had , and some letters that he 'd had from Martha Patton . And I put them in my pocket . And then I got up and looked around . It all seemed funny after hit had happened , like something that had happened indream . Fer Jim had wanted so desperate hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , and now I was a-standin ' thar with Jim 's watch and Martha Patton 's letters in my pocket and a-listenin ' to that little redbird sing . And I would go all through the war and go back home andpI07marry Martha later on , and fellers like poor Jim was layin ' thar at Chickamauga Creek . Hit 's all so strange now when you think of hit . Hit all turned out so different from the way we thought . And that was long ago , and I 'll be ninety-five years old if I am livin ' on the seventh day of August , of this present year . Now that 's goin ' back a long ways , hai n't hit ? And yet hit all comes back to me as clear as if hit happened yesterday . And then hit all will go away and be as strange as if hit happened in a dream . But I have been in some big battles I can tell you . I 've seen strange things and been in bloody fights . But the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone has ever fought  --  was at Chickamauga in that cedar thicket at Chickamauga Creek in that great war.  | EUGENE GANT WAS A WRITER , AND IN THE GREAT WORLD HE HAD attained some little fame with his books . After a while , indeed , he became quite a famous person . His work was known , and everywhere he went he found that his name had preceded him . Everywhere , that is , except where he would most have wished it  --  at home . The reason for this anomaly was not far to seek . His first novel had been based in large measure upon a knowledge of people derived from his boyhood in a little town . When the book came out , the townsfolk read it and thought they recognized themselves in the portraits he had drawn , and almost to a man the town rose up against him . He received threatening letters . He was warned never to show his face again in the precincts from which his very life had sprung . He had not expected anything like this , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took it hard . And for seven years thereafter he did not go home again . He became an exile and a wanderer . And through all these seven years when he did not go back , his thoughts went back forever . At night as he walked the streets of distant cities or tossed sleepless in his bed in foreign lands , he would think of home , recalling every feature of the little town 's familiar visage , and wondering what reception he would get at home if he should decide at last to visit it again.  |p109He  thought of this so often with the intensity of nostalgic longing that in the end his feelings built up in his mind an image which seemed to him more true than anything that he had ever actually experienced . After that it became an image that never varied . It came back to haunt him a thousand times  --  this image of what it would be like if he did go home again : One blustery night toward the end of October a man was walking swiftly down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district of Old Catawba . The hour was late , and a small , cold rain was falling , swept by occasional gusts of wind . Save for this solitary pedestrian , the street was bare of life . The street itself was one of those shabby and nondescript streets whereon the passage of swift change and departed grandeur is strikingly apparent . Even at this dreary season and hour it was possible to see that the street had known a time of greater prosperitythan it now enjoyed and that it had once been a pleasant place in which to live . The houses were for the most part frame structures in the style of that ugly , confused , and rather pretentiousarchitecture which flourished forty or fifty years ago , and , so late at night , they were darkened and deserted looking . Many of them were set back in yards spacious enough to give an illusionof moderate opulence and security , and they stood beneathancient trees , through the bare branches of which the wind howled mournfully . But even in the darkness one could see on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gaunt and many-gabled structures , beaten and swept by the cold rain , seemed to sag and to be warped by age and disrepair , and to confer there dismally like a congress of old crones in the bleak nakedness of night and storm that surrounded them . In the dreary concealments of the dark , one knew by certain instinct that the old houses had fallen upon grievous times and had beenIIO THE HILLS BEYONDp110unpainted for many years , and even if one 's intuition had not conveyed this , the strangely mixed and broken character of the street would have afforded telling evidence of the fate which had befallen it . Here and there the old design of pleasant lawns had been brutally deformed by the intrusion of small , cheap , raw , and ugly structures of brick and cement blocks . These represented a variety of enterprises : one or two were grocery stores , one was a garage , some were small shops which dealt in automobile accessories , and one , the most pretentious of the lot , was a salesroomfor a motor car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , broken by the stiff shadows of bare , tangled boughs , the powerful and perfect shapes of the new automobiles glittered splendidly , but in this splendor there was , curiously , a kind of terrible , cold , and desolate bleakness which was even more cruel , lonely , and forbidding than all the other dismal bleakness of the dark old street . The man , who was the only evidence of life the street providedat this hour , seemed to take only a casual and indifferent interest in his surroundings . He was carrying a small suitcaseandfrom his appearance he might have been taken for a stranger ; but his manner  --  the certain purpose in his stride , and the swift , rather detached glances he took from time to time at objects along the way  --  indicated that the scene was by no means an unfamiliar one but had at some period in his life been we ; known to him . Arrived at length before an old house set midway down the street , he paused , set down his suitcase on the pavement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For some moments he stood looking with nervous and distracted intentnessat the dark house as if trying to read upon its blank and gloomy visage some portent of the life within , or to decipher in one of its gaunt and ugly lineaments some answer to the quesTHERETURN OF THE PRODIGAL IIIp111tion in his mind . For some time he stood this way , but at length , with an impatient movement , he picked up his suitcase , mounted the brief flight of concrete steps that went up to the yard , advancedswiftly along the walk and up the steps onto the porch , set down his suitcase at the door , and after a final instant of disturbed hesitancy shook his head , impatiently and almost angrily , and rang the bell . The bell sent through the old dark hall within , lit dimly at the farther end by one small light , a sharp and vital thring of sound that drew from the man a shocked and involuntary movement , almost of protest and surprise . For a moment his jaw muscles knotted grimly ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raincoat , he lowered his head and waited.  --  They flee us , who beforetime did us seek , with desolate pauses sounding between our chambers , in old chapters of the night that sag and creak and pass and stir and come again . They flee us who beforetime did us seek . And now , in an old house of life , forever in the dark mid pause and watches of the night , we sit alone and wait . What things are these , what shells and curios of outworn custom , what relics here of old , forgotten time ? Festoons of gathered string and twines of thread , and boxes filled with many buttons , and bundles of old letters covered with scrawled and faded writings of the dead , and on a warped old cupboard , shelved with broken and mended crockery , an old wooden clock where Time his fatal , unperturbed measure keeps , while through the night the rats of time and silence gnaw the timbers of the old house of life . A woman sits here among such things as these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past , remembering while storm shakes the house and all the festoons of hung string sway gentlyII2 THE HILLS BEYONDp112and the glasses rattle , the way the dust rose on a certain day , and the way the sun was shining , and the sound of many voices that are dead , and how sometimes in these mid-watches of the night a word will come , and how she hears a step that comes and goes forever , and old doors that sag and creak , and something passing in the old house of life and time in which she waits alone . The naked , sudden shock of the bell broke with explosive force against her reverie . The old woman started as if someone had spoken suddenly across her shoulder . Her swollen , misshapenfeet were drawn quickly from the edge of the open oven door where she had been holding them for warmth , and , glancingaround and upward sharply with the sudden attentiveness of a startled bird , she cried out instinctively , although no one was there : " Hah ? What say ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she got up slowly , stood for a moment holding her broad , workroughenedhands clasped loosely at the waist , and after a few seconds ' troubled indecision went out into the hall and toward the closed front door , peering uncertainly and with a puzzled , troubled look upon her face as she approached . Arrived at the door , she paused again and , still holding her hands in their loose clasp across her waist , she waited a moment in uncertain and troubled meditation . Then , grasping the heavy brass knob of the door , she opened it cautiously a few inches and , prying out into the dark with curious , startled face , she repeated to the man she saw standing there the same words that she had spoken to herself in solitude a minute or two before : " Hah ? What say ? "  --  and immediately , with a note of sharp suspicion in her voice : " What do you want ? " He made no answer for a moment , but had there been light enough for her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him start and change expression , and be about to speak ,  |p113and  check himself with an almost convulsive movement of control . Finally he said quietly : " A room . " " What 's that ? " she said , peering at him suspiciously and almostaccusingly . " A room , you say ? " Then , sharply , after a brief pause : " Who sent you ? " The man hesitated , then said : " Someone I met in town . A man in the lunchroom . I told him I had to put up somewhere overnight , and he gave me your address . " She answered him as before , repeating his words in the same suspicious manner , yet her tone also had in it now a certain quality of swift reflection , as if she were not so much questioninghim as considering his words . " A man  --  lunchroom  --  say he told you ? " she said quickly . And then instantly , as if for the first time recognizing and accepting the purpose of this nocturnal visit , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often sends me people . . . . Well , come in , " she said , and opened the door and stood aside for him to enter . " You say you want a room ? " she went on now more tolerantly . " How long do you intend to stay ? " " Just overnight , " he said . " I 've got to go on in the morning . " Something in his tone awoke a quick and troubled recollectionin her . In the dim light of the hall she peered sharply and rather painfully at him with a troubled expression on her face , and , speaking with the same abrupt and almost challenging inquirythat had characterized her former speech but now with an added tinge of doubt , she said : " Say you 're a stranger here ? "  --  although he had said nothing of the sort . " I guess you 're here on business , then ? " " Well  --  not exactly , " he answered hesitantly . " I guess you could almost call me a stranger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I came from this part of the country . " " Well , I was thinkin ' , " she began in a doubtful but somewhat more assured tone , " there was somethin ' about your voice . I do n't know what it was , but  --  " she smiled a tremulous yet somewhat friendly smile- " it seemed like I must have heard it somewhere . I knew you must have come from somewheres around here . I knew you could n't be a Northern man  --  you do n't have that way of talkin ' . . . . Well , then , come in , " she said conciliatingly , as if satisfied with the result of her investigation , " if it 's only a room for the night you want , I guess I can fix you up . You 'll have to take things as you find them , " she said bluntly . " I used to be in the roomin ' - house business , but I 'm not young enough or strong enough to take the interest in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and run-down . It 's got too big for me . I ca n't look after it like I used to . But I try to keep everythingclean , and if you 're satisfied with things the way they are , why  --  " she folded her hands across her waist in a loose , reflective gesture and considered judicially for a moment " why , " she said , " I reckon you can have the room for fifty cents . " " It 's little enough , " she thought , " but still it looks as if that 's about all he 's able to pay , an ' things have got to such a state nowadays it 's either take what you can get an ' get somethin ' , or take nothin ' at all an ' lose everything . Yes , he 's a pretty seedylookin ' customer , all right , " she went on thinking . " A fly-bynightsort of feller if I ever saw one . But then I reckon MacDonaldhad a chance to size him up , an ' if MacDonald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , anyway , that 's the only kind that ever comes here nowadays . The better class all have their automobiles an ' want to get out in the mountains . And besides , no one wants to come to an old , cold , run-down sort of place like this if they can afford to go to a hotel . So I 'd better let him in , I guess , an ' take what little he can pay . It 's better than nothin ' at all . " During the course of this reflection she was peering through her glasses at him sharply and intently , and with a somewhatp115puzzled and troubled expression on her face . The figure that her old , worn , and enfeebled eyes made out in the dim , bleak light of the hall was certainly far from prepossessing . It was that of an uncommonly tall man , heavily built , and shabbily dressed in garments which were badly in need of pressing , and which , as she phrased it to herself , " looked as if he 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His face was covered with the heavy black furze of a week-old beard , and , although the features were neither large nor coarse , they had , somewhere in life , suffered a severe battering . The nose , which was short , tilted , and pugnacious-looking , had been broken across the ridge and was badly set , and there was a scar which ran slant-wise across the base of the nose . This disfigurement gave the man 's face a somewhat savage appearance , an impression which was reinforcedby the look in his eyes . His eyes , which were brown , had a curiously harsh and dark and hurt look in them , as though the man had been deeply wounded by life and was trying to hide the fact with a show of fierce and naked truculence as challengingas an angry word . Nevertheless , it was the cold anger in his eyes that somehow finally reassured the old woman . As he returned her prying stare with his direct and angry look she felt vaguely comforted , and reflected : " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then he looks honest  --  nothin ' hang dog about him  --  an ' I reckon it 's all right . " And , aloud , she repeated : " Well , then , come on . If you 're satisfied with things the way they are , I guess I can let you have this room here . " Then turning , she led the way into a room which opened from the hall to the right and switched on the dingy light . It was a large front room , gaunt hi proportions . like the house , high-ccilinged , cheerless , bare and clean and cold , with white- washed walls . There was a black old fireplace , fresh-painted and unused , which gave a bleak enhancement to the cold white barenessof the room . A clean but threadbare carpet covered the worn planking of the floor . In one corner there was a cheap dresser with an oval mirror , in another a small washstand with a bowl and pitcher and a rack of towels , and in the ugly bay window which fronted the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with a white cloth . Opposite the door stood a clean but uninviting white iron bed . The old woman stood for a moment with her hands clasped loosely at her waist as she surveyed the room with a reflective stare . " Well , " she remarked at last with an air of tranquil and indifferentconcession , " I reckon you 'll find it pretty cold in here , but then there 's no one in the house but one roomer and myself , an ' I ca n't afford to keep fires burnin ' in a house like this when there 's nothin ' comin ' in . But you 'll find things clean enough , " she added quietly , " an ' there 's lots of good , warm covers on the bed . You 'll sleep warm enough , an ' if you 're gettin ' up to make an early start tomorrow , I do n't guess you 'll want to sit up late anyway . " " No , ma'am , " he answered , in a tone that was at once harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I 'll pay you now , " he said , " in case I do n't see you in the morning when I leave . " He fished into his pockets for a coin and gave it to her . She accepted it with the calm indifference of old , patient , unperturbed people , and then remained standing there in a reflective pause while she gave the room a final meditative look before leaving him . " Well , then , " she said , " I guess you 've got all you need . You 'll find clean towels on the washstand rack , and the bathroom 's up-. stairs at the end of the first hallway to the left . "  | " Thank you , ma'am , " he answered in the same tone as before . " I 'll try not to disturb anyone . " " There 's no one to disturb , " she said quietly . " I sleep at the back of the house away from everything , an ' as for Mr. Gilmer  --  he 's the only steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years , an ' he 's so quiet I hardly know when he 's in the house . Besides , he sleeps so sound he wo n't even know you 're here . He 's still out , but he ought to be comin ' in any minute now . So you need n't worry about disturbin ' us . An ' no one will disturb you either , " she said , looking straight at him suddenly and smiling the pale , tremulous smile of an old woman with false teeth . " For there 's one thing sure  --  this is as quiet a house as you could find . So if you hear anyone comin ' in , you need n't worry ; it 's only Mr. Gilmer goin ' to his room . " " Thank you , " the man said coldly . " Everything 's all right . And now , " he added , turning away as if anxious to terminate a more protracted conversation , " I 'm going to turn in . It 's past your bedtime , too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . " " Yes , " she said hastily , turning to go , yet still regarding him with a puzzled , indecisive look . " Well , then , if there 's anything else you need " " No , ma'am , " he said . " I 'll be all right . Good night to you . " " Good night , " she answered , and , after one more parting glance around the cold walls of the room , she went out quietly and closed the door behind her . For a moment after she was gone , the man stood motionless and made no sound . Then he looked about him slowly , rubbing his hand reflectively across the rough furze-stubble of his beard . His traveling gaze at length rested on his reflected image in the dresser mirror , and for a brief instant he regarded himself intently , with a kind of stupid and surprised wonder . And suddenly ! itsp118features were contorted by a grimace as anguished and instinctiveas a cornered animal 's . Almost instantly , however , it was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head angrily as though throwing off a hurt . Then quickly and impatiently he took off his coat , flung it down across a chair , sat down upon the bed , bent and swiftly untied his muddy shoes and removed them , and then sat there numbly in a stupor for some minutes , staring before him blindly at the wall . The cold , white bareness of the room stole over him and seemed to hold his spirit in a spell . At length he stirred . For a moment his lips moved suddenly . Slowly he looked around the bare white walls with an expression of dawning recognition and disbelief . Then , shaking his head and shrugging his thick shoulders with an involuntary and convulsiveshudder , he got up abruptly , switched off the light , and , without removing the rest of his clothes , lay down upon the bed and drew a quilt across his body . And then , while storm beat against the house and cold silence filled it , he lay there , flat and rigid on his back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last the drug of cold , dark rilence possessed him , his eyes closed , and he slept . In the old house of time and silence there is something that creaks forever in the night , something that moves and creaks forever , and that never can be still . The man awoke instantly , and instantly it was as if he had never slept at all . Instantly it was as if he had never been absent from the house , had never been away from home . Strong , unreasoning terror gripped him , numb horror clove his breath , the cold , still silence laid its hand upon his heart . For in his brain it seemed a long-forgotten voice had just re/echoed , in his heart a word , and in his ear it seemed a footfall , soft and instant , had just passed . " Is anybody there ? " he said . Storm beat about the house , and darkness filled it . There was nothing but cold silence and the million drumming hoof-beats of small rain . " But I heard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice now lost , belonging to a name now seldom spoken . I heard a step that passed here  --  that of a phantom stranger and a friend  --  and with it was a voice that spoke to me , saying the one word , Brother ! ' " Is it the storm , " he said to himself , " that has a million voices ? Is it the rain ? Is it the darkness that fills an old house of life and gives a tongue to silence , a voice to something that moves and creaks forever in the night ? Or is it the terror of cold silence that makes of my returning no return , and of me an alien in this house , where my very mother has forgotten me ? Oh , is it the cold and living silence of strong terror moving in the house at night that stabs into the living heart of man the phantom daggers of old time and memory ? Is there a tongue to silence and the dark ? " Light and instant as the rain a footfall passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Storm beat upon the house , and silence filled it . Strong darknessprowled there and the bare boughs creaked , and something viewless as the dark had come into the house , and suddenly he heard it again and knew that it was there . Above his head , in Ben 's old room  --  the room of his brother , Ben , now dead these many years , and , like himself , forgotten too  --  he heard a light , odd step , as nimble as a bird 's , as soft as ashes , and as quick as rain . And with the step he heard once more the old familiar voice , saying softly : I20 THE HILLS BEYOND " Brother ! Brother ! . . . What did you come home for ? .. . You know now that you ca n't go home again ! " 2 . The Real ThingEugene Gant had been seven years from home , and many times in those long years of absence he had debated with himself , saying : " I will go home again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say my piece , speak so that no man living in the world can doubt me . Oh , I shall tell them till the thing is crystal clear when I go home again . " Concerning the town 's bitter and ancient quarrel with him , he knew that there was much to say that could be said . He also knew that there was much to say that never could be spoken . But time passes , and puts halters to debate . And one day , when his seven years were up , he packed his bag and started out for home . Each man of us has his own America , his own stretch , from which , here outward , the patterns are familiar as his mother 's face and the prospect is all his . Eugene 's began at Gettysburg , his father 's earth ; then southward through Hagerstown , and down the Valley of Virginia . First , the great barns , the wide sweep and noble roll of Pennsylvaniafields , the neat-kept houses . Lower down , still wide fields , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace and sweetness that still lingers in the Valley of Virginia . But now , for the first time , the hodden drab of nigger gray also appears  --  gray barns , gray sheds , gray shacks and lean-tos sturdy to the weather that had given them this patina to make up for the lack of paint . Now , too , the gashed and familiar red of commonTHE RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL I2Ip121clay . To Eugene Gant returning home it was all most beautiful , seen so with the eyes of absence . The rains of spring were heavy through Virginia , the land was sodden and everywhere was spotted with wet pools of light . It was almost the time of apple blossoms , and faintly there was the smell of rain and apple blossoms on the air . Through the Valley of Virginia he went down very slowly . And slowly the rains lifted , and one day , in sun and light , the blue veil round the shouldering ramparts of the great Blue Ridge appeared . Quickly , now , the hills drew in out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the blue immediate . Here was another life , another language of its own  --  the life and language of creek , hill , and hollow , of gulch and notch and ridge and knob , and of cabins nestling in their little patches of bottom land . And suddenly Eugene was back in space and color and in time , the weather of his youth was round him , he was home again . Following some deep , unreasoning urge that sought to delay the moment and put off the final impact of his return , he took a circuitous course that carried him southwestward from Virginiainto Tennessee , then south again , beyond the high wall of the mountains , to Knoxville . From there the road to Altamontis long and roundabout . Almost at once it starts to mount the ramparts of the Great Smokies . It winds in and out , and goes by rocky waters boiling at the bottom of steep knolls , then climbs , climbs , winds and climbs . May is late and cold among the upper timber . Torn filaments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here the chestnut blight is evident : ruined , in the blasted sweeps , the great sentries of the heights appear. 122 THE HILLS BEYONDp122Very steep , now , the road went up across the final crest of the mountains . The ruined hulks of the enormous chestnut trees stood bleakly on the slopes . High up on the eroded hillsides , denuded of their growth , were the raw scars of mica pits . Beyond , stretching into limitless vistas , were the blue and rugged undulations of a lost and forgotten world . And suddenly a roadside sign  --  Eugene was back in Old Catawba , and the road started down again , to Zebulon . Zebulon  --  the lost world . Zebulon  --  the syllables that shaped the very clay of his mother 's ancestral earth . And all at once he heard his mother 's voice echo across the years : " Son ! Son ! . . . Where are you , boy ? I 'll vow  --  where has he gone ? " And with it came faint echoes of the bell that came and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the lost voices of his kinsmen in the mountains long ago . With it returned old memories of his mother 's endless stories about her people , stories of Marches long ago , of bleak dusk and rutted clay , of things that happened at sunset in the mountains when the westering red was pale , ragged , cold , and desolate , and winter was howling in the oak . And with the echo of his mother 's voice , that had seemed to fill all the days of his childhood with its unending monotone , there returned to him an immediate sense of everything that he had ever known : the front porch of the old house in Altamont where he had lived , the coarse and cool sound of Black 's cow munching grass in the alleyway , along the edges of the backyard fence , the mid-morning sound of sawn ice out in the hot street of summer , the turbaned slatterns of good housewives awaiting noon , the smell of turnip greens , and , upon the corner up above , the screeching halt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had gone , then the liquid smack of leather on the pavementas the men came home at noon for dinner , and the slamp123of screen doors and the quiet greetings ; and , inside the house , the cool , stale smell of the old parlor , and the coffined , rich piano smell , the tinkling glasspoints of the chandelier , the stereopticonof Gettysburg , the wax fruit on the mantel underneath its glass hood , and he himself reclining on his father 's couch , buried in a book , his imagination soaring with Hans Grimm , and with thoughts of witches , a fair princess , fairies , elves , and gnomes , and of a magic castle on a rock . Then a memory of one particular day , and his mother 's voice again : " Child ! Child ! . . . I 'll vow  --  where is that boy ? . . . Son ! Son ! Where are you ? ... Oh , here ! Boy , here 's your Uncle Bacchus . He comes from Zebulon , where all your folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in Zebulon , where he was born a hundred years ago  --  an ' Uncle Bacchus , he was my father 's brother . " And then the voice of Uncle Bacchus , drawling , quiet as the sifting of the winter ash , impregnant with all time and memory , and in it suggestive overtones of the voices of lost kinsmen long ago : " I knowed the minute that I seed him , ' Liza  --  fer he looks like you . " The voice was benevolent , all-sure , triumphant , unforgettable  --  ashateful as the sound of good and unctuous voices that speak softly while men drown . It was the very death-watch of a voice , the voice of one who waits and watches , all-triumphant , while others die , and then keeps vigil by the dead in a cabin in the hills , and drawls the death-watch out to the accompanimentof crackling pine-knots on the hearth and the slow crumblingof the ash . " Your Uncle Bacchus , child , from Zebulon  --  " So memory returned with Eugene Gant 's return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road he went his own way home . The tallest hills in all the eastern part of North America soared on every side . The way wound steeply down by blighted chestnut trees and brawling waters into the mountain fastnesses of old Zebulon . And the voice of Uncle Bacchus came back again : " Yore grandpaw , son , was my own brother . He was born , like all of us , on the South Toe out in Zebulon . He married yore grandmaw thar and settled down and raised a family . His paw before him  --  my paw , too-he come in thar long years before . I 've heerd him tell it was wild country then . Thar was Cherokees when yore great-grandpaw first come in thar . Yes , sir . And he hunted , fished , and laid traps fer bear . He growed or trapped everything he et . He was a great hunter , and one time they say he run the hounds the whole way over into Ten-nessee . " Then his mother 's voice again : " That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father tell about it a thousand times . . . . You must go out there some day , son . It 's many years since I was there , but dozens of my people are still livin ' out in Zebulon . There 's Uncle John , an ' Thad an ' Sid , an ' Bern , Luke , an ' James  --  they 're all there with the families they have raised . . . . Well , now , I tell you what  --  Uncle Bacchus is right about it . It was a wild place back in those days . Why , father used to tell us how much wild life there was even in his time . But look here  --  why , was n't I readin ' about it just the other day ?  --  an article , you know  --  says the wild life has all gone now . " The county seat of Zebulon is a little town . Eugene decided to stay overnight and see if he could hunt out any of his mother 's people . There was no hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment he began to make inquiries about the Pentlands , his mother 's family , he seemed to run into people every/where who said they were relatives of his . Most of them he had never seen before , or even heard of , but as soon as he identified himself they all appeared to know who he was , and the first show of suspicion and mountain aloofness with which they had greeted him when they thought him a stranger quickly melted into friendly interest when they placed him as " Eliza Pentland 's boy . " One man in particular proved most obliging . " Why , hell , " he said , " we 've all heard of you from your cousin Thad . He lives a mile from town . And your Uncle Johnny and Bern and Sid  --  the whole crowd of them are out upon the Toe . They 'll want to see you . I can drive you out tomorrow . My naive is Joe Pentland , and we 're fifth cousins . Everybody 's kinfolkshere . There are only fifteen thousand people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . So you 're goin ' home again ? Well , it 's all blown over now . The people who were mad about the book have forgotten it . They 'll be glad to see you . . . . Well , you wo n't find this much of a town after the cities you have seen . Six hundred people , a main street , a few stores and a bank , a church or two  --  that 's all there is ... . Yes , you can get cigarettes in the drug store . It 's still open  --  this is Saturday night . You 'd better wear your coat . We 're thirtysevenhundred feet up here  --  we 've got a thousand feet on Altamont  --  you'llfind it cooler than it is down there . . . . I 'll go with you . " The night had the chill cool of mountain May , and as the two men walked along , a nerve , half ecstasy , was set atremble in Eugene 's blood . The country street was fronted by a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rawness of the Baptist Church . A light was burning inside the church , and the single squat and ugly window that faced the street depicted Christ giving mercy in the bleak colors of raw glass . The drug store was on the corner at the crossroads . Next door was apI26lunchroom . Three or four ancient and very muddy Fords were parked slanting at the curb before the drug store . A few feet away , outside the lunchroom , there was a huddled group of men in overalls , attentive , watching , like men looking at a game of cards . From the center of the group came a few low words  --  drawling , mountain-quiet , somehow ominous . Eugene 's companionspoke casually to one of the men : " What is it , Bob ? " The answer came evasive , easy , mountain-quiet again : " Oh , I do n't know . A little argument , I guess . " " Who was that ? " asked Eugene as they entered the drug store . " That was Bob Creasman . Said there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's my cousin  --  and he 's drunk again . It happens every Saturday night . A bunch of ' em was at the quarry this afternoon , and they 've been drinkin ' corn . I guess they 're arguin ' a bit . . . . What 's yours ? A Coca-Cola ? ... Make it . two cokes and a couple of packs of Chesterfields . " Five minutes later , as the two men emerged from the drug store , there was a just-perceptible stir in the attentive group of men outside . " Wait a minute , " said Joe Pentland . " Let 's see what 's goin ' on . " There was the same quietness as before , but the waiting men were now drawn back against the lunchroom window , and in front of them two others stood and faced each other . One of them was in overalls , and he was saying : " Now , Ted . . . . " The other was more urbanely clothed in dark trousers and a white shirt without a collar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he just stood there staring heavily , his sullen face , sleepy-eyed , thrust forward , silent , waiting.  | " Now , Ted , " the one in overalls repeated . " I 'm warnin ' ye . ... You 're goin ' too fer now . . . . Now leave me be . " Drowsy-eyed , swart-visaged , and unspeaking , a little sagging at the jowls , a little petulant like a plump child , darkly and coarsely handsome , with his head thrust forward , the other listens sullenly , while the men , attentive , feeding , wait . " You leave me be now , Ted . . . . I 'm not lookin ' fer no trouble , so you leave me be . " Still sullen and unspeaking , the swart visage waits . " Ted , now , I 'm tellin ' ye . . . . When ye cut me up six years ago , yore family an ' yore kindfolks begged you out of hit ... . Now you leave me be . . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted , but you 're goin ' too fer now . . . . You leave me be . " " It 's Ted Reed and Emmet Rogers , " Joe whispers hoarsely in Eugene 's ear , " and they 've started in again . They had a fight six years ago . Ted cut Emmet up , and now they always get this way on Saturday night . Ted , he gets to drinkin ' and acts big  --  but pshaw ! he would n't hurt a fly . He ai n't got the kind of guts it takes to be real mean . Besides , Will Saggs is here  --  the one there in the white shirt  --  he 's the cop . Will 's scared  --  you can see that . Not scared of Ted , though . See that big man standin ' back of Will  --  that 's Lewis Blake , Ted 's cousin . That 's who Will 's afraid of . Lewis is the kind that wo n't take nothin ' off of nobody , and if it was n't for him Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something 's happening ! " A quick flurry , and " Now , goddam you , Ted , you leave me be ! " The two men are apart now , Ted circling the other , and slowly his hand goes back upon his hip . " Look out ! "  --  shouted from the crowd . " He 's got his gun ! " There is the dull wink of blue metal at Ted Reed 's hips , the overalled line fades back , and every waiting man now jumps for cover . The two principals are left alone . " Go on and shoot , goddam you ! I 'm not afraid of you ! " To Eugene , who has dodged back into the recessed entrance of the drug store , someone calls out sharply : " Better git behind a car there at the curb , man ! You ai n't got no protection in that doorway ! " Moving with the urgency of instant fear , Eugene dives across the expanse of open pavement just as the explosion of the first shot blasts the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a car . Cautiously he peers around the side to see Emmet moving slowly with a strange grin on his face , circling slowly to the shot , mocking his antagonist with the gun , his big hands spread palms outward in a gesture of invitation . " Go on , goddam you , shoot ! You bastard , I 'm not scared of you ! " The second shot blows out a tire on the car Eugene has retreated to . He crouches lower  --  another shot  --  the sharp hiss of escaping air from another tire , and Emmet 's whine , derisive , scornful : " Why , go on and shoot , goddam you ! " A fourth shot " Go on ! Go on ! Goddam you , I 'm not " A fifth  --  and silence . Then Ted Reed comes walking slowly past the row of cars . Men step out from behind them and say quietly : " What 's wrong , Ted ? " Sullenly , the gun held straight downward at his thigh : " Oh , he tried to git @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other : " Where 'd he git ' im ? " " Right underneath the eye . He never knowed what hit ' im . " " You 'd better go on , Ted . They 'll be lookin ' fer you now . " pI29Still sullen : " The bastard was n't goin ' to git smart with me . .. Who 's this ? "  --  stopping to look Eugene up and down . Joe Pentland , quickly : " Must be a cousin of yours , Ted . Leastways , he 's a cousin of mine . You know  --  the feller who wrote that book . " With a slow and sullen grin Ted shifts the gun and offers his hand . The hand of murder is thick flesh , strong , a little sticky , cool and moist . " Why , sure , I know about you . I know your folks . But , by God , you 'd better never put this in a book ! Because if you do " Other voices , coaxingly : " You better go along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Go on , you fool , go on . " " because if you do  --  " with a shake of the head and a throaty laugh  --  " you and me 's goin ' to git together ! " The voices breaking in again : " You 're in fer it this time , Ted . You carried it too fer this time . " " Hell , you could n't git a jury here in Zebulon to convict a Reed ! " " Go on , now . They 'll be lookin ' fer ye . " " They do n't make jails that can hold a Reed ! " " Go on . Go on . " And he was gone , alone , and with his gun still in his hand  --  gone right down the middle of the quiet street , still sullenjowledand sleepy-eyed  --  leaving a circle of blue-denimed men , and a thing there on the pavement which , two minutes before , had been one of their native kind . Eugene saw it all , and turned away with a leaden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the echoes of his mother 's voice , saying : " The wild life has all gone now . " At last Eugene was home again in Altamont , and at first it was good to be home again . How many times in those sevenp130years had he dreamed and thought of going home and wondered what it would be like ! Now he was back , and saw , felt , knew it as it really was  --  and nothing was the way he had imagined it . Indeed , there was very little that was even as he remembered it . Of course there were some things that had not changed , some things that were still the same . He heard again all the small familiar sounds of his boyhood : the sounds of night , of voices raised in final greetings , saying " Good night " as screen doors slammed  --  " Good night , " far off , and the receding thunderdroneof a racing motor  --  " Good night , " and the last street car going  --  " Good night , " and the rustle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner . Again he heard in the still-night distance the barking of a dog , the shifting of the engines in the yards , the heavy thunder of the wheels along the river 's edge , the clanking rumble of the long freights , and far off , windbroken , mournful , the faint tolling of the bell . He saw again the first blue light of morning break against the rim of eastern hills , and heard the first cock 's crow just as he had heard it a thousand times in childhood . Niggertown was also still the same , with the branch-mire running in the nigger depths , yellow , rank with nigger sewage . And the smells were just the same  --  the sour reek from the iron laundry pots mixed in with the branchmire smell and the acrid tang of woodsmoke from the nigger shacks . So , too , no doubt , were the smells the same inside of nigger-shackdom  --  the smells of pork , urine , nigger funk , and darkness . He remembered all of this with the acid etchings of a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canvas strap around his neck and the galling weight of the bag forever pulling at him , he had gone down to Niggertown upon his paper route and had heard , a hundred times repeated every morning , the levelp131smack of ink-fresh news against the shanty doors and the drowsy moan of funky wenches in the sleeping jungle depths . These things were still the same . They would never change . But for the rest , well " Hello , there , Gene ! I see you 've put on weight ! How are you , boy ? " " Oh , fine . Glad to see you . You have n't changed much . " " Have you seen Jim yet ? " " No . He came by the house last night , but I was n't there . " " Well , Jim Orton 's been looking for you  --  he and Ed Sladen , Hershel Brye , Holmes Benson , Brady Chalmers , Erwin Hines . ... Why , say ! Here 's Jim now , and all the rest of them . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all piled out of the car that had pulled up at the curb : " Here he is ! . . . All right , we 've got him now ! . . . So you decided to come home again ? . . . What was it you said about me in the book  --  that I concealed the essential vulgarity of my nature behind a hearty laugh ? " " Now look here , Jim  --  I -- I  --  " " I  --  1 -- hell ! " " I did n't mean  --  " " The hell you did n't ! " " Let me explain  --  " " Explain nothing ! Why hell , man , what is there to explain ? You did n't even get started in that book . If you were going to write that kind of book , why did n't you let me know ? I could have told you dirt on some of the people in this town that you never even heard about . . . . Look at his face ! . . . We 've got him now ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so backed . It 's all forgotten now . A lot of them around here were pretty hot about it for a while .

Only  --  " " Hell , he wo n't do nothing ! No one will . The only ones who are mad today are those you left out ! " More laughter . " Hell , it 's true ! The rest of ' em are proud of it ! . . . We 're all proud of you , son . We 're glad that you came home . You 've been away too long . Stay with us now . " " Why , hello , son ! Glad to see you back ! . . . You 'll find many changes . The town has improved a lot since you were here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were put up since you left . Cost four million dollars . Have you seen the tunnel they bored under the mountain for that new roadway out of town ? Cost two million more . And the High School and the Junior College , and the new streets , and all the new improvements ? . . . And look at the Square here . I think it 's pretty now the way they 've laid it out , with flower beds and benches for the people . That 's the thing this town needs most  --  some parks , scene new amusements . If we hope to bring tourists here and mate this a tourist town , we 've got to give them some amusements . I 've always said that . But you get a bunch of messheads in at City Hall and they ca n't see it . . . . Fact is , tourists do n't stay ha : re any more . They used to come and stay a month . You ought to know  --  you wrote about them sitting on the porches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the porches , and they 'd stay a month , people from all over  --  Memphis , Jacksonville , Atlanta .

You ca n't blame them  --  we 've got no amusements . . . . Why , I can remember when this was a sporting . The big swells all came here , the millionaires and racing . And we had seventeen saloons  --  Malone 's , and Creasman 's , Tim O'Connell 's , and Blake 's , and Carlton Leathergood'sfatherused to go in there , he was a friend of Leathergood's. you remember Leathergood 's tall , pock-marked , yellow nigandhis spotted dog ? All gone now  --  dead , forgotten ... . re 's where your father 's shop used to stand .

The whole town wants to see you . I wo n't keep you . Come to see me sometime . My office is on the eleventh floor  --  right over where your father 's workbench used to be . I 'll show you a view you never dreamed of when your father 's shop was here . " The return of the prodigal , and the whole town broken into greetings , while the on-coming , never-ceasing younger generation just gaped , curiously a-stare : " He 's back . . . .

Why I remember him when he was a snotty-nosed little kid , running around the street selling Saturday Evening Posts , and delivering a route in Niggertown for the Courier . " " But why , he 's fat around the waist .... And look ! He just took his hat off . Why , he 's getting bald on top ! . . . Oh-h , I never thought " " What did you think ? He 's thirty-six years old , and he never was very much to look at , anyway .

How is Long ? " " He 's very well thank you I wo n't keep you now I see you 're busy with your friends I know everyone wants to see you you must be rushed to death but sometime when you are n't busy I 'd like to talk to you my daughter-in-law is very talented she paints sculptures and writes plays she 's dying to meet you she 's written a book and she says the experience of her life is so much like yours that she 's sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only get together to talk about it  --  " " Oh , I 'd love to .

An ' yes , that 's so !  --  Sam Colton called up for the alumni committee of the university , an ' they want you to speak to ' em at the big alumni rally next week at the Country Club .

Then there was Jimmy Stevenson , he called up and wanted you to come to a steak dinner to be given by the Business Men 's Convention out at Sharpe 's Cabin on the Beetree Creek , nine miles from Gudgerton . I 'd certainly go if I were you . I 've never seen the place , but they say Ed Sharpe certainly has a beautiful cabin , the best one around here  --  an ' as the feller says , right in the heart of Nature'sWonderland , in the center of these glorious hills .

An ' , yes  --  two young fellerscalled up from over in Tennessee  --  said they 're the Blakely boys . You 've heard of the famous Blakely Canners . Why , I hear that they own almost every farm in three counties there , an ' they 've got factories everywhere , through Tennessee , an ' way down South , an ' all out through the Middle West  --  why , they 're worth millions . Says  --  oh , just a boy , you know  --  but says , real slylike , Is this Miss Delia ? '  --  givin ' me the name you gave me in the book . Well , I just played right along with him  --  Well , now , ' I says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Eliza . Now I 've heard that I 've been called Delia , but you must n't believe all that you read , ' I says . For all you know , I may be human just like everybody else . Now , ' I says , I looked real good and hard at myself this mornin ' in the mirror , an ' if there are any horns stickin ' out of my head , why I must 've missed ' em , I did n't see any . Of course I 'm growin ' old , an ' maybe my eyesight 's failin ' me , ' I says , but you 're young an ' ought to have good eyes , so why do n't you come an ' have a look an ' tell me what you think . ' Well , sir , he laughed right out across the phone as big as you please , an ' says , Well , you 're all right ! I think you 're wonderful ! An ' I 'm tryin ' to be a writer  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think your son 's one of the best writers that we have . ' Well , I did n't let on , of course . Father always taught us that it was vulgar an ' unrefined to brag about your own , so I just said , Well , now , I do n't know about that . But you come on an ' look at him . Up to the time he was twelve years old , ' I says , he was a good , normal sort of boy like everybody else . Now what happened to him after that , ' I says  --  you see , I thought I 'd have a little fun with him  --  ' what happened after that I do n't know  --  I 'm not responsible . But you come an ' take a look at him . Maybe you 'll get surprised . Maybe you 'll find he does n't have horns , either . ' Well , he laughed right out an ' said , You 're all right ! An ' I 'm goin ' to take you up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' over tomorrow afternoon  --  an ' we 're goin ' to bring him back with us , ' he says . If he wants a cabin like I hear he does , I 've got one here that I can give him , so we 're goin ' to bring him back , ' he says . Well , you ca n't do that , of course , child , but be nice to them . He spoke like a very well-brought-up sort of boy  --  an ' the Blakelys are the kind of people that you ought to know . . . . An ' after that a lot of girls called up an ' said they heard you needed someone to type for you  --  said they 'd like to do it , and knew how to type good . One of ' em said she 'd be willin ' to do it for nothin '  --  says she wants to be a writer , an ' knew she 'd learn so much from you an ' what an inspiration it would he . Hm ! pshaw ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you ! Sounded funny to me  --  wantin '  |p139to  work for nothin ' , an ' all that gushy talk about inspiration . I knew what she was after , all right . You watch out , son  --  do n't let any of these silly women rope you in . . . . Yes , that 's so . Cash Hopkins was here askin ' about you . Of course he 's just a plain , workin ' sort of man . He used to do jobs for your father , but your father liked him , an ' he 's always been our friend , interested in all of you .... Mr. Higginson was here , too . He 's an Episcopal minister that came to town several years ago for his health  --  an ' what about it !  --  he 's been your friend right from the start . When all the preachers were denouncin ' you , an ' sayin ' you 'd disgraced us all , an ' everyone was down on you an ' said if you ever came back here they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood right up for you ! He read everything you wrote an ' he said , That boy should have been a preacher . He 's got more of the true gospel in his books than all of us preachers put together ! ' Oh , he came right out for you , you know . It 's we who have failed , ' he said , not him ! ' Child , I hope you 'll be nice to Mr. Higginson . He 's been your friend from the first , an ' , as the sayin ' goes , he 's a scholar an ' a Christian gentleman . . . . An ' , law , what about it ! I 'm sorry you were not here to see it . I 'll vow , I had to turn my head away to keep from laughin ' . Why , Ernest Pegram , if you please , in his big car  --  all rared back there in a brand-new Cadillac as fat as a pig , an ' with a big cigar stickin ' out of his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He 's well-fixed  --  every last one of the Pegrams is ! You see , when Will Pegram died two years ago up there in the North somewhere , he was a wealthy man , a big official in some large corporation . You see , he was the only one of the Pegrams who got away . But , poor Will ! I can remember just as well the day he left here more than forty years ago  --  this corporation had given him a job down in the eastern part of the state , an ' , as the sayin ' goes , he did n't have an extra shirt to put on his back . An ' here he dies two years ago an ' leaves close to a million dollars . So they 're well-fixed ! Of course , Will had no childern , an ' his brothers an ' sisters got it all . He left Ernest a flat hundred thousand  --  that'swhat it was , all right , because I read it in the papers , an ' Ernest told me so himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here the rest of us are broke , the whole town ruined , everyonehas lost everything they had  --  as the Bible says , How have the mighty fallen ! '  --  but the Pegrams do n't have to worry from now on . So Ernest drives up an ' stops before the house this afternoon in his big , new car , smokin ' his fine cigar . Why , Ernest , ' I says , I do n't think I ever saw you lookin ' better . Are you still workin ' at your plumbin ' trade ? ' I says . Of course I knew he was n't  --  I just wanted to hear what he would say . No , Eliza , ' he says  --  oh , the biggest thing you ever saw , puffin ' away at his cigar . No , ' he says . I 've reached the age , ' he says , when I figgeredit was about time to retire . ' Pshaw ! Retire ! I had to turn my head away to keep from laughin ' . Who ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever have to retire on  --  that 's what I 'd like to know  --  if it had n't been for Will ? But  --  oh yes , see here , now  --  says : You tell Gene , ' he says , that I have n't got a thing to do . My time is free , ' he says , an ' if there 's any place he wants to go , any place where I can take him , why , my car is here , ' he says , an ' it 's at his disposal . ' You know how goodheartedhe 's always been . I reckon he was thinkin ' of the days when he used to live next to us on Woodson Street , an ' how he watched all you childern grow up . The Pegrams have always been our friends an ' taken a great interest in your career . I wish , son , that you 'd go to see them all while you 're here . They 'll be glad to see you . But when I saw Ernest there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar , an ' lookin ' fat enough , as the sayin ' goes , to pop right out of his britches , an ' tellin ' me he had retired  --  well , I just had to turn my head away an ' laugh ... .  |p141Well  , in all my life I 've never seen the beat of it ! There 's been a steady string of them here all day long , an ' the telephone has just rung constantly . I 'll vow  --  it seems to me that everyone in town has either been here or called up today . . . . An ' , oh yes ! There are two of ' em out in the sun parlor now  --  old Cap'n Fitzgerald and a Miss Morgan , a trained nurse . I do n't know what they want . They 've been waitin ' for an hour , so I wish you 'd just step out an ' say hello to ' em . . . . An ' yes ! There 's three more in the front parlor  --  a lady who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books an ' was just passin ' through town an ' heard you were here an ' wanted to shake hands with you , an ' that young Tipton that you used to know , an '  --  oh yes ! that 's so !  --  the reporter from the paper , he 's there , too . I guess he wants to write you up , so you 'd better go right in . . . . I 'll vow ! There goes that phone again ! Just a minute , son  --  I ' 11 answer it :  | A N ARMENIAN FRIEND OF OURS , A MR . VLADIMIR ADZIGIAN OF SOUTH Brooklyn , has mentioned among the defects of our literary style a certain coldness and economy of tone and manner , which , while it makes for precision and temperance , is likely to err too much on the side of understatement . This critic feels  --  and rightly , too , we think  --  that our work would profit if it had a little more exuberance , a more impulsive warmth , even a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , " exaggeration is in itself a form of enthusiasm , and enthusiasm , in my opinion , is the quality that your work , together with almost all American writing , lacks . " This cultivated gentleman then goes on to say that here in America we have never overcome the repressive influences of our Puritan ancestry , and he thinks we will never completely realize ourselves until we do . While admitting the truth of our friend 's observations and conceding regretfully that our own style does suffer from a kind of puritanic sparseness , an almost frigid restraint , we think we might interpose a few mild , although apologetic , reservations to the general tenor of his remarks . In the first place , if our style does suffer from a puritanic frigidity , it is because we , in our own person , suffer from the same defect . And however much we may regret it , however much we may want to burst through the barriers of our reserve to a warm and free communication with the universe , it is probably better to reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cold and hard  --  than to as/sume a false , unwarranted spontaneity that we do not have . Moreover , even if we could overcome the constrained reserve of our nature and break through to a more impulsive spontaneity , we should hesitate to attempt it , because we have so many friends and readers whose own sense of propriety and personal modesty would be affronted if we did . Chief among these people are our Irish friends , whom we number by the hundreds . Our admiration and affection for the Irish is , we believe , well known . In addition to the traditional affection for the race in which every American boy is brought up , and which is as natural to him as a sore toe , we have had the privilege time and again in our written works of expressing  --  as soberly and temperately as any man could , it seemed to us , and certainly far too soberly and temperately to suit the tastes of Mr. Adzigian  --  what seemed to us to be the shining and distinguishing qualities of the race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have found frequent occasion to pay tribute to their sterling honesty , the devotion of their public service , their brilliant skill in politics and government , which have given them a record of unselfish and incorruptible administration that is , we believe , unequaled by any other people in the world . Where else in the world may a people be found who will so cheerfully and uncomplainingly take over the onerous and thankless burden of running the government , and whose devotion to the principles of law and order , sobriety , reasonable conciliation , and selfless and unseeking consecration to the common weal are as high , loyal , and untarnished in their idealism as are those of the Irish ? Where else , among all the peoples who make up the vast polyglot of American life , will another people be found whose patriotism is not only one hundred per cent American , but maintains a constantaverage of one hundred and thirty-seven per cent ? pI44 We have considered it not only a duty but an agreeable privilege to refer to these well-known facts on several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely because of the quiet protests of our Irish friends themselves . For , said they , the only reward they ever desired or hoped for was the knowledge of public duty modestly done and honorably completed . Virtue was its own exceeding great reward . There were , it was true , among other peoples , certain odious demagogues who were always making public speeches in their own behalf , and slapping themselves proudly on their own breasts ; there were even those contemptible characters who regarded politics as a means of feathering their own nests out of the common funds . As for themselves , however , all they asked was the joyful privilege of serving their state or their city as well as they could , giving to their country the last full measure of devotion . That was reward enough , and the knowledge that one had given his all for his country should be sufficient for any man . Certainly the thought of public acknowledgment for such a noble and idealistic service was odious , and would we please not affront their deepest and most sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was presented to us in this way by many of our dear Irish friends , we consented reluctantly to refrain from a further public display of our enthusiasm rather than incur the quiet reproaches of a people who , as is well known , are among the shyest and most modest races in the world . In mattersof literary judgment , however , we trust we may be allowed a more full and free expression of our emotions , since every race , no matter how innately modest , how consecrated to a public trust , may be justly proud of its artistic achievements , and justly boastful of all its men of genius . We take it as a matter of general consent that Ireland has always swarmed with geniuses . Old Erin has been for centuriesp145running over with them  --  has , in fact , had so many of this glorious type that it has been necessary to establish a kind of emigration service for the exportation of Irish geniuses to other nations which , though bigger , are lamentably deficient in their genius supply . The leading customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair land . In fact , we do not believe it any extravagant exaggeration to say that where genius is concerned the Irish brand tops the list with us . Here in America we 'd rather have one good , bona-fide , Irish genius than a half-dozen Polish , Swedish , Czecho-Slovakian , or Hungarian specimens , no matter what their reputations . It is true that visiting Englishmen are still in considerable demand , and ply a thriving trade before the Culture Clubs and Female Forums of the Corn Belt . Almost any ninth-rate scribblerfrom Great Britain can still come over here and insult the country with the choicest and most indecipherable sneers in his whole Oxford vocabulary , and command prices from his adoring audiences that no American could dream of asking . Yes , there is still a good market for the English genius , but among the haut ton , so to say , the true sophisticates of culture , the Irish bards and story tellers come first . A bad English writer may still put in a profitable six or eight months and eat and drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tacoma , Washington , at the expense of this great , benevolent , and culture-loving people . But to do so requires considerable traveling , and the English genius can not always pick his spots ; he must occasionally prepare himself for the uncomfortable exigencies of one-night stands , bad accommodations , and poor food . An Irish genius is faced with none of these embarrassing possibilities . He can pick his spots and do as he damn pleases . He can remain in New York in the perfumed salons of the art-loving plutocracy , and can always have the very best of everything at no cost to himself , provided he exercises only a very small degree of caution and has sense enough to know upon which side his cake is caviared . An Englishman may have to stand an occasional round of drinks , or stay with the second-best family in Hamtramck , Michigan , but a visiting Irishman  --  never ! A visiting Englishman may have to have at least the vestige of a reputation  --  to have received the endorsement of Hugh Walpole , or to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Priestley  --  but a visiting Irishman needs nothing . It is naturally preferable if someone has heard of him before , but it is by no means essential . The main thing is that he be a visiting Irish writer , and , of course , all visiting Irish writers are geniuses , and not only geniuses , but the most Extra-Special , A-Number-i , Eighteen-Carat Geniuses in existence . After that , no introduction is necessary . He can just call himselfSean O'Mulligan or Seamus O'Toole or some other whimsical appellative of this nature , and everything will be all right . He needs only to get off the boat and announce to the reporters that he is the author of an untranslated and untranslatable epic , written in pure Gaelic ( he disdains , of course , to use the English speech , unless it be to cash a check ; otherwise he abhors the race that has cruelly , bloodily , and damnably oppressed Old Erin for a thousand years , etc. , etc. , etc. ) , and from that time on his path is smooth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will only come down the gangplank mutteringthrough his whiskers something about " a green leprechaun which they do be sayin ' an old man in the west was afther seein ' on the hill behint his house , year afther year , bedad , " or some other elfin talk of this nature , by which the bearded adults of this race strive to convince themselves and other people that they are really just a lot of little boys , the whole thing will bep147lapped up greedily , will travel the round of the salons , and be hailed as a perfect masterpiece of whimsey , just too Irish , quaint , and delightful for words . Many a visiting Irish bard has established a reputation , achieved celebrity , and eaten and drunk his way into the Great American Heart on no better grounds than this . It may be perfectly true , of course , that while all this is going on  --  while the Irish genius is muttering through his whiskers about the fairies and the leprechauns , and is being coddled in the silken laps of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some poor , benighted bastard of a native son , some gaunt-eyed yokel from Nebraska , Texas , Tennessee , or Minnesota , may be eating his heart out in a Greenwich Village garret , opening canned beans at midnight , and wreaking out the vision of his life here in America with all the passion , fury , terror , suffering , poverty , cruelty , and neglect which a young man in this abundant land may know . It may be true , we say , that while the visiting Seans and Seamuses are chirping on Park Avenue about their leprechauns to an adoring audience of silken wenches , some wild-eyed native youth may be pounding at the wall of his garret with bloody knuckles , wondering where , when , and how in God 's name , in a swarming city of eight millions , he can find a woman , or even slake his hunger for a moment with the bought and bitter briefness of a whore . Yes , while the lovely legs cross slowly , and slide the silken thighs , while the fragrant bellies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy may be burning in the night , burning in the lone , stern watches of darkness , and giving a tongue to silence that will shape a new language long after silken thighs and Sean and Seamus are no more . But have no perturbations , gentle reader . When the boy has won through from the agony of silence to an uttered fame , when his toiling and imperiled soul has beat its way to shore , whey by his own unaided effort he stands safe on land , you may depend on it that he will be at once encumbered with the help he no longer needs . Lovely legs and silken thighs and fragrant bellies will then heave amorously for him , as they do now for Sean , and every little whore of wealth and fashion will contend for the honors of the bed that poverty had bachelored and that fame has filled . The youth , once left to rot and starve , will now be fawned upon and honeyed over by the very apes of fashion who previously ignored him , and who now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their adoration will be more odious than the treachery of their neglect , for it stands written in Fame 's lexicon that he who lets himself he whored by fashion will be whored by time . Perhaps the reader may detect in these grave lines a color of some bitterness . Perhaps he may be shocked to realize that there is some slight neglect among the people of this present age , in this enlightened and art-loving nation , toward the young native artist . It is conceivable that the reader may espy here , in this true picture of our native customs , some tincture of injustice , some snobbery of fashion , some conceit of taste . But there are high authorities on these matters who will quickly inform the reader that if he thinks any of these things he is seriously mistaken . It is necessary to look at what George Webber learned in college to call " The Deeper and More Significant Aspects of the Situation . " Seen in this light , things which may have seemed a little difficult and puzzling become beautifully clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life in considerable detail , and in that chronicle I have shown that the usual reception of our young native artist during the years of his apprenticeship is ap149good , swift kick in the teeth , followed by a good , swift kick in the seat of the pants that will send him flying out of doors onto the pavement . The reason why this happens to the poor , young , native son , while Sean and Seamus eat and drink and wench it to their heart 's content , is not because anyone means to be cruel or indifferent , but because great men and lovely women of the Cultured Classes have found out long since that the best thing that could possibly happen to a poor young man of native stock and talent is to get a few good kicks in the face . They know that he can come to his full maturity only through adversity , so they kick him out of doors just to help him along . In this way he is prevented from getting soft . People who live in luxury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting soft . To be sure , everyone is willing to sympathize with a young man 's early struggles after he has had them , but , obviously , there can be no sympathy unless he has had them . Any enlightened millionaire can explain " The Deeper and More Significant Aspects of the Situation . " It is really a part of what we call " The American Dream . " It belongs to our ideal of rugged individualism . The more often one gets kicked in the teeth , the more rugged he becomes . It is our method of doing things , and such a simple and direct expression of our life that we have even invented a name for it . We speak of it proudly as " The American Way . "  | THE PERSONALITY OF THE CELEBRATED DR . TURNER-OR DR . HUGO Twelvetrees Turner as he was generally known to the readingpublic  --  was not an unfamiliar one to George Webber , the novelist . Dr. Turner 's wider reputation had been well known to the public for fifteen years or more . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the splendid journal he had himself established , the Fortnightly Cycle of Reading , Writing , and the Allied Arts . The establishment of the Fortnightly Cycle marked , as one critic says , " one of the most important literary events of our time , " and life without it , another offered , would have been " simply unthinkable . " The Cycle came into being at the time when the critical field was more or less divided between the somewhat prosaic conservatism of the Saturday Review of Literatureand the rather mannered preciosity of The Dial . Between the two , Dr. Turner and The Cycle struck a happy medium ; the position of The Cycle might be best classified as middle-of-theroad , and Dr. Turner himself might be described as the nation 's leading critical practitioner of middle-of-the-roadism . Here , really , lay his greatest contribution . It is true that there were certain skeptics who stubbornly disputedDr . Turner 's right to such a title . These critics , instead of being reassured by the broad yet sane liberalism of the Doctor 's views , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Turner 's critical opinions a tendency toward a disturbing  --  nayp151dangerous ! radicalism . Such a judgment was simply ridiculous . Dr. Turner 's position was neither too far to the right nor too far to the left , but " a little left of center . " With this definition he would himself have instantly agreed ; the phrasing would have pleased him . True , there had been a period in Dr. Turner 's rich career when his position had been much more conservative than it now was . But to his everlasting credit let it be said that his views had grown broader as the years went on ; the years had brought increase of tolerance , depth of knowledge , width of understanding ; ripeness with this valiant soul was all . There had been a time when Dr. Turner had dismissed the works of some of the more modern writers as being the productionsof " a group of dirty little boys . " Indeed the first use of this delightfully homely and pungent phrase may be safely accredited to Dr. Turner himself . People on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapped the Fortnightly Cycle on their thighs and cried out " Capital ! " It was just the way they themselves had always felt about these moderns , except that they had never found quite the words to put it so ; but this man now , this What's-His-Name , this Turner  --  oh , Capital ! Capital ! It was evident that a fearless , new , and salutary force had come into the Nation 's Letters . A little later on , however , Dr. Turner 's " dirty little boy " had been qualified somewhat by the adjectival words , " who scrawls bad words which he hopes may shock his elders upon the walls of privies . " This was even better ! A pleasing image was thus conveyed to the readers of Dr. Turner 's Fortnightly Cycle that brought much unction to their souls . For what could be more comforting to a devoted reader of the Fortnightly Cycle than the reassuring sense that just as he was settling down to attend to one of the most inevitable of the natural functions , he might look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words that various dirty little boys like Anatole France , George Bernard Shaw , TheodoreDreiser , Sherwood Anderson , and D. H. Lawrence had scrawled up there with the intention of shocking him . If Dr. Turner had made no further contribution to literature , his position would have been secure . But more , much more , was yet to come . For even at this early stage one of the salient qualitiesof Dr. Turner 's talent had revealed itself . He was always able to keep at least two jumps ahead , not only of his own critics , but of his own admirers . Thus it was Dr. Turner who first made the astonishing discovery that Sex is Dull . The news at first stunned the readers of the Fortnightly Cycle , who had begun to be seriously alarmed about the whole matter , shocked , appalled , and finally reduced to a state of sputtering indignation by " This  --  this Sort of Thing , now ; Sort of Thing they 're writing nowadays ; this , this  --  why , this Filth ! This fellow Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest . Dr. Turner was neither appalled , shocked , nor incensed by anything he read about sex . He did n't get indignant . He knew a trick worth six of these . Dr. Turner was amused . Or would have been amused , that is , if he had not found the whole business so excessively boring . Even as early as 1924 , he was writing the following in comment on a recent book of D. H. Lawrence : " This preoccupation with Sex  --  really not unlike the preoccupationof a naughty little boy with certain four-letter words which he surreptitiously scrawls upon the sides of barns  --  ( observehow the earlier exuberances of the Doctor are here subtly modified )  --  would on the whole be mildly amusing to an adult intelligence who had presumed that these were things that one had lived through and forgotten in one 's salad days , if it werep153not for the fact that the author contrives to make the whole business so appallingly dull . " The readers of the Fortnightly Cycle were at first amazed , then simply enchanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexed  --  but now ! Why , hah-hah-hah , the whole thing was very funny , was n't it ? The extreme seriousness of the fellow about the Kind of Thing they had themselves forgotten since their sophomore days  --  would really be quite amusing if he had not contrived to make it so abysmally Dull ! There was more , much more , to come . The whole tormented complex of the ' twenties was upon good Dr. Turner . People everywhere were bewildered by the kaleidoscopic swiftness with which things changed . It was a trial that might well have floored a less valiant spirit than that of Dr. Turner . Hardly a week went by without its discovery of a new great poet . Scarcely an issue of the Fortnightly Cycle appeared without proclaiming to the world some new novel to equal War and Peace . And not a month passed without producing some new and sensational movement in the bewildering flux of fashion . Charlie Chaplin was discoveredto be , not primarily a comedian at all , but the greatest tragic actor of the time ( learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role was Hamlet ) . The true art-expression of America was the comic strip ( the productions of the Copleys , Whistlers , Sargents , Bellowses , and Lies could never hold a candle to it ) . The only theater that was truly native and worth preserving was the burlesque show . The only music that was real was Jazz . There had been only one writer in America : his name was Twain , and he had been defeated just because he was  --  American ; he was so good just because he was  --  American ; but if he had not been American he could have been  --  so good ! Aside from this , the only worthwhile writing in the land was what the advertising writers wrote ; this was the true expression of the Yankee clime  --  all else had failed us , all was dross . The madness grew from week to week . With every revolution of the clock the Chaos of the Cultures grew . But through it all the soul of Dr. Turner kept its feet . Turner hewed true and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in their true proportion , he was just . True , he had lapses . In culture 's armies he was not always foremostto the front . But he caught up . He always caught up . If there were sometimes errors in his calculations , he always rectified them before it was too late . If he made mistakes  --  like the man he was , he gallantly forgot them . It was inspiring just to watch his growth . In 1923 , for instance , he referred to the Ulysses of James Joyce as " that encyclopaedia of filth which has become the bible of our younger intellectuals " ; in 1925 , more tolerantly , as " that bible of our younger intellectuals which differs from the real one in that it manages to be so consistentlydull " ; in 1929 ( behold this man ! ) as " that amazing tour de force which has had more influence on our young writers than any other work of our generation " ; and in 1933 , when justice Woolsey handed down the famous decision that made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a notable editorial that covered the entire front page of the FortnightlyCycle ) , as " a magnificent vindication of artistic integrity ... the most notable triumph over the forces of bigotry and intolerancethat has been scored in the Republic of Letters in our time . " Similarly , when one of the earlier books of William Faulkner appeared , Dr. Turner greeted it with an editorial that was entitled , " The School of Bad Taste . " He wrote : " One wonders what our bright young men will do for material now that the supply of four-letter words and putrescent situationsp155has been so exhausted that further efforts in this direction can only rouse the jaded reader to a state of apathy . Is it too much to hope that our young writers may grow tired of their own monsters and turn their talents to a possible investigation of  --  dare we hope it ?  --  normal life ? " A few years later , however , when Mr. Faulkner 's Sanctuary appeared , the Doctor had so altered his views that , after likening the author to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . his sense of the macabre . . . his power to evoke stark fear , sheer horror , as no other writer of his time has done , " he concluded his article by saying darkly to his readers , " This man may go far . " Thus , although Dr. Turner was occasionally out of step , he always fell in again before the Top Sergeant perceived his fault . Moreover , once he got into the fore , he had a very brave and thrilling way of announcing his position to his readers as if he had been in the crow 's nest all along and had cried " Land Ho ! " at the very moment when the faint shore of some new and brave America was first visible . These , then , were among the Doctor 's more daring discoveries . Some of the more conservative of his following were made uneasyby such risky venturesomeness , but they should not have been alarmed . For , if the Doctor ever stuck his neck out , it was only when he had it safely armor-plated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always well-hedged round by flanking guards of reservations . Upon more familiar ground , however , the Doctor would go the whole hog in a way that warmed the soul . His praises of the Joyces , Faulkners , Eliots , and Lawrences were always fenced in by parentheses of safe reserve ; even the Dreisers and the Lewises had their moderating checks ; but when the Millays , Glasgows , Cabells , Nathans , and Morleys were his meat , he spoke out of the fullness of his heart then it was , in vulgar phrase , that the Doctor really went to town . And , curiously enough , it was just here , when Dr. Turner was on what he himself was fond of classifying as " safe ground , " that his judgment was likely to grow giddy and was prone to err . This exuberance later caused him some embarrassment . Thus , at various stages of his editorial career , he had described ChristopherMorley as being the possessor of " the most delightful prose style that the familiar essay has known since the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost his equal , Charles Lamb . Aside from Lamb there is no other essayist since Mon taigne 's time to match him . " Of Ellen Glasgow he wrote : " She is not only our greatest living novelist , but one of the greatest novelists that ever lived , " and that lady 's many works he characterizedas " . . . in their entirety comprising a picture of a whole society that , for variety and scope , has no parallel in literatureexcept the Comedic Humaine , and that , in the perfection of their form and style , achieve a faultless artistry that Balzac 's cruder talent never reached . " The whimsy-whamsy of Robert Nathan he pronounced " sheer genius . There 's no other word for it ; it 's sheer elfin genius of a kind that not even Barrie has attained , and that has no rival in our language unless perchance it be the elfin loveliness of the Titania-Oberon scenes in A MidsummerNight 's Dream . " Of the baroque pilgrimage of Mr. Cabell in his Province of Cockaigne he wrote : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style in the language  --  perhaps the only Pure Artist that we have . " And of a young gentleman who wrote a book about a bridge in South America he said : " A great writer  --  certainly the greatest writer that the Younger Generationhas produced . And the book ! Ah , what a book ! A book to be treasured , cherished , and re-read ; a book to put upon your shelves beside War and Peace , Don Quixote , Moby Dick , Candide ... and withal a book , that , without one touch of the dreary and degrading realism that disfigures the work of most of our younger writers , is so essentially , splendidly American . . . as American as Washington , Lincoln , or the Rocky Mountains , since in its story are implicit the two qualities that are most characteristic of our folk : Democracy through Love ; Love through Democracy . " The world being the grim place it sometimes is , it is sorrowful but not surprising to relate that there were a few wicked spirits who took a cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first been uttered , and after they had lain decently interred in old copies of the Fortnightly Cycle for so long that presumably they were as dead as most of the books that had evoked them . Then the worthy Doctor had to pretend he did not know that they were there , or else eat them , and of all the forms of diet this is the toughest and least palatable . But on the whole the Doctor came through nobly . The sea at times was stormy and the waves ran very high , but the staunch ship that was Turner weathered through . Among his followers , it is true , there were some whose tendencieswere so conservative that they deplored the catholicity of the Doctor 's tastes . And among his enemies there were some who were cruel enough to suggest that he wanted to be all things to all men , that Turner was not only the proper , but the inevitable , name for him , that the corkscrew shaped his course , and that if he went around the corner he would run into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both these groups was simple , dignified , and complete : " In the Republic of Letters , " said he , " of which I am a humble citizen , there are , I am glad to say , no factions , groups , or class distinctions . It is a true Democracy , perhaps the only one that now exists . And as long as I am privileged to belong to it , in however modest a capacity , I hope I shall be worthy of it , too , and broad enough to see all sides . " In appearance , Dr. Turner was scarcely prepossessing . He was so much below the middle height that at first sight it seemed that one of Singer 's Midgets had enjoyed a run of extra growth . His little bread-crumb of a body ( for in appearance he suggested nothing so much as a piece of well-done toast ) was surmounted by a head of normal size which appeared too large for the meager figure that supported it . His face resembled somewhat that of the little man one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caption " The Common People . " It was such a face as one might see upon the streets a hundred times a day , and never think of later : it might have belonged to a bank clerk , a bookkeeper , an insurance agent , or someone going home to Plainfield on the 5:15 . George Webber was himself one of the good Doctor 's more belated discoveries . When the author 's first book , Home to Our Mountains , appeared , Dr. Turner had not been favorably impressed . The review in the Fortnightly Cycle had been a very gem of bland dismissal : " No doubt the thing is well enough , " said Dr. Turner , " but after all , old Rabelais is really so much better "  --  a conclusion which the unhappy author was by no means minded to dispute . Six years later , upon the eve of publication of Webber 's secondbook , the good Doctor was still undecided just what he was going to do about it or him . Three weeks before the book was released for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after confessing that he had read an advance copy of the new work , he added grimly : " I have n't yet made up my mind about Webber . But , " said he bodingly , " I 'll make it up within a week or two . " Between then and the time the book came out ,  |p159Dr  . Turner apparently felt the telepathy of moderating influences  --  " You can always tell , " as he was wont to say , " when Things are in the Air "  --  so that when his critique ultimately appeared , it was much more favorable than Webber or his publisher had dared to hope . Not that the Doctor was thoroughly persuaded , but he took a more conciliating tone . The book , he averred , " could hardly be called a novel "  --  he did not trouble to explain what could it was really " a Spiritual Autobiography . " Then , having arrived at this sounding definition , he discussed the volumefreely in **26;7163;TOOLONG terms , and on the whole was pretty favorable about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little nest for Webber without in any way impinging on the jealous precincts of more splendid birds on more importantboughs . The way for a rapprochement was thus opened gracefully and when George Webber first met the Doctor some months later their greetings were of a friendly kind . Indeed the good Doctor was so very friendly that he insisted forthwith on taking Webber home with him , and would accept no refusal . So they went , and the manner of their going was very much like that of an ocean liner being warped from its berth and down the river and out to sea by a busy little tug . " Darling , " said Dr. Turner to his wife when at last they reached the house , " I want you to meet Mr. Webber . Oh , pshaw , now ! I ca n't get used to all this Mister stuff . I 'm going to call you George ! " cried Dr. Turner with an air of bluff heartiness that was simply irresistible . " I know so many people that you know , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no other name seems possible . " Webber murmured that he was enchanted to be thus addressed , meanwhile feeling a little helpless and confused under the hypIbO THEHILLS BEYONDp60notic influence of Mrs. Turner , who , holding him by the hand , was looking steadily into his eyes with a slow , strange smile . " You ! " she said at length . " Youl " she repeated slowly and deliberately , and then concluded simply , " You wrote the book . " Webber felt vague , not knowing just how to answer this , but managed to mumble that he had . The lady 's reply was to continue to hold him by the hand and to regard him steadily with a fixed smile that seemed to harbor some dawning mirth to which no one else was a party . " You ! " she said presently again . " I do n't know , but somehow you make me laugh . You amuse me . There is something about you that is like  --  is like  --  an Elf ! " " Yes , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he went on with an air of hasty explanation in the manner of people steering away from well-known reefs : " My wife was awfully interested in that book of yours . Awfully . Of course , we all were , " he went on rapidly . " Matter of fact , I wrote three full columns on it , " he went on with just a tinge of nervous constraint , as if he hoped this fact would make everything all right . " I believe it was the longest review I have done since An American Tragedy . I was awfully interested in it . Did you see my review by any chance ? " he asked , and then quickly , before Webber could answer : " I was really awfully interested . I called your book a kind of Spiritual Autobiography . I mean , " he added quickly as Webber opened his mouth as if to speak , " it really made me think of Wilhelm Meister . Not  --  " the Doctor instantly cried , as Webber started to open his mouth again  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course there were passages in it that were very much like War and Peace . I remember saying to Mrs. Turner at the time , You know , there are times when he is very much like Tolstoi . ' " " And like  --  an Elf , " said Mrs. Turner at this point , never forp161a moment relinquishing her grasp on Webber 's hand , and continuing to smile steadily at him in a slow , strange way . " So like an Elf , " she said , and laughed merrily . " And , of course , " said Dr. Turner rapidly , " there 's the Moby Dick influence , too . I know I told my wife at the time that there were passages , magnificent passages , " cried Dr. Turner , " that were much like Herman Melville . " " And like an Elf ! " the wife said . " But more like Moby Dick ! " the Doctor said decidedly . " And still more , " thought Webber , whose mind was at last beginning to work slowly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In this way , after so long and perilous a voyage , the stormtossedmariner , George Webber , was brought to port by the good Dr. Turner . And if he was not berthed among the mighty liners , at least he now had anchorage in the slips where some of the smaller vessels in the Turnerian haven were.  | IT WAS MORNING , SHINING MORNING , BRIGHT MOTES OF MORNING in the month of May , when James awoke . An old man in a big room in a great house in the East Seventies near Central Park . A little , wiry , bright-eyed man in the great master 's chamber of one of those lavish , fatly sumptuous , limestone-and-marble , mansard-roof , bastard-French-chateau atrocities which rich men were forever building for their wives some forty or fifty years ago . But this was 1929 , and shining morning in the month of May , when James awoke . He awoke as he did everything , very cleanly , abruptly , and aggressively , with a kind of grim pugnacity . He would not fool with slumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with it . He liked comfort and the best of everything , but he hated softness , sloth , and feeble indecision . There was a proper time and place for everything  --  a time for work ; a time for sport , travel , pleasure , and society ; a time for a good dinner , brandy , and a good cigar ; and last of all , a time for sleep . James knew when the time for everything should be . For when a thing was finished it was finished . This applied to sleep as well as to every other useful , pleasant thing in life . He had discharged his debt to sleep and darkness for eight hours , now he was done with it . He paid sleep off as he would sign a check  --  cleanly , sharply , vigorously , with a final flourish of the - D e n  --  " P a y to the order of  --  Sleep  --  Eight and no hrs . I00  --  James Wyman , Sr. "  |p163There  you are , sir ! You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled ! But , come now ! No silly business , if you please , of yawningsleepily , stretching out luxuriously , rolling over on your other side , and mumbling some damned nonsense about " just five minutes more , " or some such stuff as that ! And none of this business of pulling cobwebs from your brain , getting your eyes unglued , brushing the filaments of sleep away , trying to wake up , come out of it , remember where you are ! No ! Wake up at once ! Come out of it cleanly ! Be done with it the moment your eyes are open ! Get up and go about your work  --  day 's beginning , night is over , sleep-time 's done ! James awoke like this . He was a small and wiry figure of a man , aged seventy-four , with a cold fighter 's face . It was not a hard face , in no respect a brutal , savage , or distempered face  --  no , on the whole it was a rather pleasant face , certainly a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The face was very bright , and had a brisk , sharp , and rather frosty look . The eyes were very blue , frosty-looking , and as cold and straight as steel . The hair was white and close-cropped , likewisethe mustache . The nose was long and cold and definite , the whole structure of the face slightly concave , the straight , grim mouth touched faintly at the edges with the eternal suggestion of a grin  --  a grin that was good-humored enough , but also straight , hard , cold , naturally truculent . It was the face of a man who hated fear and despised those who were afraid , which could respect another face that looked right back at it and told it to go to hell , and feel contempt for the face that trembled and the eye that shifted from its own cold steel ; a face which could be savage , ruthless , merciless to what it hated and despised , and gravely generous , loyal , and devoted to what it liked ; a face which could be intolerant , arrogant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could not be mean . James lay still for a moment with his cold blue eyes wide awake and staring at the ceiling . Then he looked at his watch . It lacked only a few minutes of eight o'clock , his invariable time for rising every morning in the city for the past fifty years . In the country , save for Sundays , he rose one hour and fifteen minutesearlier . He fumbled in the bosom of his nightshirt and scratched himself hairily and reflectively . He had worn a nightshirtall his life , as his father had before him , and as any sensible man would do . He had enough of the discomforts of clothing during the business day . When he went to bed he was n't going to put on a damned monkey suit with bright green stripes all over it , rope himself in around the belly like a sack of meal , and incase his legs in trousers . No ! The place to wear pants was on the street and in the office . When he went to bed he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and belly , He swung to a sitting posture , worked his toes into his bedroom slippers , got up , walked across the room , and stood looking out the window at the street . For a moment he felt giddy : the clear mind reeled a little , the knees felt weak , he shook his head impatiently , and breathed deep ; pushed the heavy , corded curtains as far back as they would go , opened the window wider . His heart was pumping hard ; the thin , grim smile around the firm mouth deepened . Seventy-four I Well , then  --  what ? And for a moment , still holding to the heavy curtain with the veined old hand , he stood looking out into the street . Few people were about and stirring . Across the street , in a big **26;7191;TOOLONG similar to his own , a housemaid on her knees was mopping marble steps . A rickety-looking wagon drawn by a shaggy little horse went rattling by . Six doors away a taxi drilled past in the early morning of Fifth Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees and shrubs of Central Park just greening into May . Here in his own street , before the ugly , lavish houses , there were a few trees , all spangled with young green.  |p165Bright  , shining morning slanted on the house fronts of the street , and from the tender , living green of the young trees the bird song rose . A fine morning , then , and , from Nature , May , and sunlight it borrowed a too pleasant coloring , James thought , for such a damned ugly street . It was a typical street of the rich in the East Seventies  --  a hodgepodge of pretentious architectures . The starkly bleak and solid ugliness of brownstone fronts was interrupted here and there by lavish bastard-French chateaux like his , and in the middle of the block by the pale salmon brick facade , the fashionable flat front , and the green canopy of a new apartment house . He turned , still smiling grimly . Out in the hall the deep-toned grandfather clock was striking eight through morning 's quietness , and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned , his valet entered . The man said , " Good morning , sir , " in a quiet tone . James grunted " Morning " in reply , and without another word walked across the room into the bathroom , and after a moment flushed the toilet noisily , then washed his hands in the old streakedmarblebasin , turned the tumbling water on full blast into the big old-fashioned ivory-yellow tub , and , while the tub filled , surveyedhimself in the mirror , craning his neck , and rubbing his hand reflectively across the wiry gray stubble of his beard . He got his shaving things out of the cabinet and set them up in readiness , stropped his old straight razor vigorously , and with an air of satisfaction tested its deadly whetted blade , laid his razor down beside the other shaving things , turned off the water , stripped the nightshirt off over his head , stepped into the tub , and let himself down gingerly and with an easeful grunt into the water . It took him four minutes to bathe and dry himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crane cautiously , and shave the tough gray stubble of his beard as smooth as a grained wood . By the time he had finished , cleaned his old , worn razor with tender pride , and put his shaving things away again , it was eight-ten . As he re-entered his bedroom in his dressing gown , the servant had just finished laying out his clothes . From the old walnut dresser or bureau , the man had taken socks , fresh underwear , a clean shirt , cufflinks , and a collar ; and from the huge old walnut wardrobe a suit of dark clothes , a black necktie , and a pair of shoes . James would have none of " this new-fangled furniture " in his room . By this he meant that he would have neither the modern style of recent years , nor the passionately revived Colonial . His bedroom was furnished with massive Victorian pieces that had come from his father 's bedroom many years before . The high and hideous old dresser , or bureau , had a tall mirror with a carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slab of gray-streaked marble , indented and sunk between some little boxlike drawers ( God knows what these were for , but probably for collar buttons , shirt studs , cufflinks , collars , and what he called " thing-ma-jigs " ) ; below were some ponderous walnut drawers with brass knobs , which held his shirts , socks , underwear and nightshirts . The huge walnut wardrobe was at least ten feet tall ; and there was a monstrous walnut table with thick curved legs and a top of the same hideous gray-streaked marble that the bureau had . James crossed the room to the chair beside the bed , threw off his dressing gown , and , grunting a little and holding on to the man with one hand for support , thrust first one wiry shank , and then the other , into a pair of long half-weight flannel drawers , buttoned a light flannel undershirt across his hairy chest , put on his white starched shirt and buttoned it , got the starched cuffs linked together , and looked around for his trousers , which thep167man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and said : " Wait a minute ! Where 's that gray suit  --  the one I got last year ? I think I 'll wear it to-day . " The valet 's eyes were startled , his quiet voice touched just traceably with surprise : " The gray , sir ? " " I said gray , did n't I ? " said James grimly , and looked at him with a naked challenge of the cold blue eyes . " Very well , sir , " the man answered quietly ; but for a moment their eyes met , and although the face of each was grave , and that of James a trifle grim and truculent , there was also a sharp enkindled twinkle in the eyes of each , a kind of " tickled " quality that would not speak , because there was no need to speak . Gravely , imperturbably , the man went to the doors of the great walnut wardrobe , opened them , and took out a neat , doublebreastedsuit of light gray  --  a decidedly gay and skittish suit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still imperturbable , the man came back , laid out the coat , held out the trousers to his master , and gravely held the trouser ends as James grunted and thrust gingerly into them . The servant did not speak again until James had hitched his braces over his square shoulders and was buttoning up the neat buttons of the vest . " And the necktie , sir ? " the man inquired . " You will not be wearing the dark one now , I suppose . " " No , " said James , hesitated for a moment , then looked the man pugnaciously in the eye and said : " Give me a light one  --  something that goes with this suit of clothes  --  something gay . " " Yes , sir , " the man answered calmly ; and again their eyes met , their faces grave and stern , but in their eyes again the sly , enkindledtwinkle of their recognition . It was not until James was carefully knotting under his wing collar a distinctly fashionable cravat of light spring gray , slashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say smoothly : " It 's a fine morning , is n't it , sir ? " " It is ! Yes , sir ! " said James firmly and grimly , and looked at his servant truculently again ; but again there was the enkindledsparkle in their eyes , and the man was smiling quietly behind his master 's back as James marched sprucely from his chamber . Outside the master 's door the hall was dark and heavy , cushionedto the tread , still with silence , sleep , and morning , filled with walnut light and the slow tocking of the clock . James glanced toward the door of his wife 's chamber . The huge walnut door was also eloquent with silence , steep , inviolable repose . He smiled grimly and went down lavish marble stairs . They swept down with magnificence : the ghostly feet of memory and old event thronged on them  --  the rustle of silk and satin and the gleam of naked shoulders , proud tiaras , bustles , dog collars of hard diamonds , ropes of pearls . He smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! From the great reception hall at the bottom he looked in at the lush magnificence of the huge salon : at the red carpet , velvet to the tread ; at the fat red plush chairs with gold backs and gilded arms ; at the straight , flimsy , ugly , brutally uncomfortablelittle chairs of gold , with faded coverings of silk ; at the huge mirrors with gilt frames , also a little faded ; at the French clock , a mass of fat gilt cupids , gew-gaws , thing-ma-jigs ; at the damned ugly tables , cabinets , glass cases , all loaded down with more thing-ma-jigs , gew-gaws , china figures , vases , fat gilt cupids . Junk ! Well , this was what they wanted forty years ago  --  what theyp169thought they wanted , anyway  --  what the women wanted  --  what she wanted . He had let her have it ! He had always hated it . He had said often and grimly that the only comfortable room in the whole damned place was his bathroom ; the only easy chair , the stool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he would n't let them ! As for the rest of it , it was no home . It was a kind of frigid mausoleum for what people used to call " Society . " It had been built for that purpose forty years ago , when people went in for that kind of thing , and when everyone was trying to outdo his neighbor in ugliness , vulgarity , lavish pretentiousness  --  in strident costliness , blind waste , and arrogant expense . As such , no doubt , it had served its purpose well ! It had cost him a quarter of a million dollars , but he doubted if he 'd get a hundred thousand if he put it on the block tomorrow . You could n't even keep the damned barn warm ! And now ? And for the future ? Well , she would outlive him . The Parrotts alwayslived longer than the Wymans . What would happen ? He did n't have to die and go to heaven to find out the answer to that one ! She 'd try to swing it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be her money then  --  she 'd run the show , and she 'd find out ! She 'd give a reception or two , attempt a party in the old grand manner , try to revive dog-collardom  --  and find out dog-collardom was dead forever ! She 'd get a few old hags , their skinny necks and bony arms encrusted with their jewelry ; a few doddering old fools , creaking at the joints and lisping through their artificial teeth  --  all trying to revive the ghostly pomps of Mrs. Astor ! She 'd get a few furiouslybored young people , there at grandma 's imperative command , wondering when in God 's name the ghastly business would be over , when they could decently escape from the MorguepI70 and flee to glittering spots of music , dancing , noise , and alcohol  --  and she 'd find out ! Grimly , he fancied he could already hear her anguished screech when bills came in and she discovered what it cost , discovered further that it was her money she was spending now , and that money did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was her own tree now , the Parrott tree . That made a difference , did n't it ? For the Parrotts , he reflected grimly , were known for their tender solicitude where their own tree was concerned  --  whether it was a family tree or a money tree . Her father  --  damned old fool !  --  had spent the last twenty years of his life writing a single book . And what a book ! The Beginnings of the New England Tradition : A History of the Parrott Family . Great God , had anyone ever heard of such conceitedbilge as that since time began ! And he  --  James Wyman , Sr.  --  had had to persuade one of his publishing acquaintances to print the damned thing ; and then he had had to endure the gibes , the digs , the witticisms of all his friends at the club  --  or else listen to the Parrott screech . Of the two evils he had taken , he thought , the lesser one . Swift ridicule , he had concluded , was better than slow torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's tongue can not be stilled . Well , she 'd find out , he thought , and grimly paused upon the marble flags of the reception hall , and grimly stared into the faded splendors of the great salon . He thought he foresaw the anguished progress of events already : The screech of pained astonishmentwhen she saw the bills  --  the bills for coal alone  --  those ten-ton truck loads , car loads , barge loads , train loads of black coal required just to keep the grave-damp chill of this damned tomb reduced to a degree of semi-frigidness from Octoberuntil May . And the caretakers , the nightwatchmen , the housekeepers , and so on , required to keep it guarded , watchedp171and mended , dusted off  --  from May until October  --  when the family was away ! As if anyone was going to walk off with the damned thing ! Oh , if someone only would !  --  if a parliament of public-spirited second-story men , yeggmen , dynamiters , roof-andcellarmen , elegant silk hatted Raffieses , and plain commongardenburglars in secret session assembled would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter , search , seize , and take away everything they could lay their hands on while the family was out of town : if they would only turn up before the barn at night in five-ton trucks , armored motor cars , swift sedans : if they would only come with any vehicle they had  --  wheelbarrows , furniture vans , or covered wagons  --  and walk out with every bit of junk in sight  --  all of the damned plush chairs , and gilt French clocks ; all of the vases , statuettes , and figurines ; all of the painted china , crimson carpets , agonizing chairs and hideous tables ; all of the gew-gaws and thing-ma-jigs , the imposing sets of unread books and the bad portraits of the ancestors , including the atrociousone of Parrott , Sr. , author of The Beginnings of the New England Tradition  --  the old fool !  --  and while they were about it , also overpower , gag , chloroform , and spirit away into oblivion all of the caretakers , housekeepers , nightwatchmen , and " Breakfast is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered , the oh-most-elegant , refined , and sugared tones , James started . As if shocked with an electric current , he turned and stared grimly into the unctuous , oily visage of his butler , Mr. Warren.  --  and yes ! above all , and by all means , if some kind-hearted gang of kidnappers would only remove out of his hearing , sight , and memory forever the pompous person and the odious presence of Old Sugarlips " Coming , " James said curtly . " Very good , sir , " Sugarlips replied with maddening unctuous/ness . Then the butler turned solemnly and departed down the hall  --  departed with the pompous waddle of his big , fat buttocks , his bulging and obscenely sensual calves ; departed like the disgustingfat old woman that he was , with his oily face and his fat lips set in an expression of simpering propriety  --  Oh , if only Sugarlips would depart for good ! If only nobleheartedkidnappers would do their merciful work ! If only he  --  James Wyman , Sr.  --  could somehow free himself from Sugarlips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life , so that he could enjoy a moment 's peace and privacy in his own house without being told that something was " Very good , sir , " enjoy a moment 's rest and relaxation without Sugarlips " Begging your pardon , Sir , " sit down at his own table to feed himself in his own way without feeling Sugarlips ' damned moist breath upon his neck , eat as he chose and what he chose and help himself the way he chose without having every movementcensured by the interrogation of that fishy eye , the infuriatingassurance of " Allow me , sir . " If only he  --  James Wyman , Sr.  --  free , white , and  --  seventyfour !  --  afree American citizen , by God !  --  could come and go the way he chose to come and go , sit where he wanted , eat as he wished to eat , do as he pleased and as a free man had a right to do  --  without having all the acts , engagements , and arrangementsof his personal and most private life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tired ; he was ill , he knew ; he was getting sour and crotchety  --  yes , he knew all this  --  but , Great God ! Great God !  --  he was an old man and he wanted to be left alone ! He 'd seen and known it all , now  --  he 'd tried all the arguments , found all the answers , done all the things he should have done  --  that the world of his time , his wife , his family , and Society , had expected of him  --  even this  --  and Great God ! why had he done them ? Was it worth it ? He stared in againp173ong the faded splendors of the great salon , and for a momentis cold blue eyes were clouded by the shade of baffled doubt . lie had wanted a home to live in , had n't he ?  --  a place of warmth , of light , a dwelling place of love and deep security  --  he had had all the means of getting it , had n't he ?  --  wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to this ? Somewhere , somehow , he had missed out in life , something had been put over on him . But where ? And how ? How and where had he failed ? He had been one of the conspicuous men of his time and generation  --  conspicuous not alone for his material achievements , but conspicuous for character , honesty , integrity , and fair-dealing in the world of money-getting , pirate-hearted , and red-handed Yankeedom . Of all the men of that time and generation , he was among the first . There were great names in America today  --  names great for wealth , for power , for ruthlessness , for their stupendous aggrandizements . And he knew the way most of those names were tainted with dishonor , those names of men who had so ruthlessly exploited life , destroyed their fellows , betrayedmankind and their own country . Those names , he knew , would be a stench in the nostrils of future generations , a shame and a disgrace to the unfortunate children and grandchildren who would have to acknowledge them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own name was triumphantly secure . And yet something had gone wrong ! Where ? How ? He was no whiner ; he was a brave man and a fighter ; and he knew that wherever lay the fault , the fault , dear Brutus , lay not in his stars , but in himself ! But  --  ( James stared grimly in among the faded splendors of the great salon )  --  his life had come to this ! And why ? Why ? Why ? Had all gone ill then ? By no means ! There had been high effort , great accomplishment . There had been true friendship ;  | rooted , deep affection ; the confident regard of Kings and Presidents , statesmen , men of letters , great industrialists , other leading bankers and financiers like himself . He had yielded to no man to his own dishonor ; he had yielded to many with fair-dealing , generous concession , unresentful pardon . He had fought hardest when the odds were all against him , but had eased pressure when he was on top ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exulted over a fallen foe . No , the slate was clean , the mirror was unclouded  --  yet , he had come to this . An old man , living with an old wife , in an old dead graveyard of a house  --  alone . Old James looked in upon the faded gilt of morning with a baffled eye . Where had it gone to , then  --  all of the passion and the fire of youth , and the proud singing ; all of the faith , the hope , the clean belief of fifty years ago ? Where had it gone to , then  --  the strength , the faith , the wisdom , the sound health and substance of his lost America ? Had it been only a dream , then ? No , it was no dream  --  " for he lay broad awaking "  --  or , if dream , then such a dream as men have lived a million years to dream  --  to hope for  --  to achieve . But where now ? Gone  --  all gone  --  gone like phantasmal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deathless dream submerged in ruin . In the great world all around him now he saw black chaos explodinginto unpurposeful and blatant power ; confusion swarmingthrough the earth , the howling jargons of a million tongues , each one dissimilar , none speaking to another ; brute corruption crowned with glory , privilege enthroned . Where once there had been the patient hard confusion of honest doubt , the worried perturbation of strong faith , was now the vile smirk of a passive acceptance , the cheap sneer of the weakling lip , the feeble gibe of the ignoble vanquished , gibing their own treason and their lack of faith , the fattied heart no longer sound enough for battle ,  |p175the  clouded and beclamored mind no longer clear enough for truth , the bleared eye murked with rotten mockeries . The thin venom of the tongues just sneered and said  --  " Well , what are you going to do about it ? "  --  and so were lost , all joined together in the corrupt defenses of their shame and cowardice  --  all kneelingbasely at the feet of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own monsters , all yielding , all submissive to the gods of money-getting and of mockery , all bent forward to kiss the dyer 's bloody hand subdued to its own dye . So was his lost America rotted out . Gone , now , the faith , the youth , the morning , and the passion : the gold , the singing , and the dream  --  all vanished like phantasmal smoke , and come to this ! And from this , too ! For had he not sold out somewhere along the line ? But where ? Where ? Where ? The hour , the moment , and the actual point of crisis  --  where ? Had not he who was James Wyman fifty years ago  --  young and brave and an American who had the faith , and felt the strength and heard the singing , who had seen the plains , the rivers , and the mountains , the quiet blueness in a farmhand 's eyes , and had heard the voices in the darkness talking , known how the land went , and the shapes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something more than dream , the great hope something more than hope  --  had not he , James Wyman , who had seen and heard and felt and known all these things , as all men in this land have known them  --  had he not sold out somewheredown the line ?  --  taken what the others had to give ?  --  believed what others had to say ?  --  accepted what they had to offer ? And what was that ? Dog-collardom , vulgarity , and empty show , the hypocrisies and shrill pretenses of a clownlike aristocracy , the swinish gluttonies of last year 's hog all varnished over with his this-year 's coat-of-arms , the no-questions-asked philosophy of money-sewerdom , proud noses lifted with refined disdain at uncouth table manners , but not too nice or dainty to appraise with charity the full , rich droppings of a scoundrel 's bank account . Yes , he had so accepted , he had been so persuaded , he had so believed ; or , so believing that he so believed , had so sold out somewhere , being young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : an old man , living with an old wife , in an old graveyard of a house  --  alone . And , looking grimly in upon the faded gilt of morning in the great salon , James reflected that not even morning entered here . No , nothing young and sweet and fresh and alive and shining could exist here . Even light , the crystal shining light of spring , of morning , and of May , was staled and deadened here . It forced its way in dustily , it thrust in through the reluctantfolds of the plush curtains , it came in in mote-filled beams of dusty light , it was old and dead before it got here  --  . like the plush , the gilt , the carpets , the chairs and tables , the gew-gaws , bric-a-brac , and thing-ma-jigs  --  as musty , stale , and full of death as all the things it fell upon . No , it was not like Morning , really , by the time it had forced its painful entrance in that room . Rather , James reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  --  it was  --  well , it was like After the Ball Is Over . The whole house , he thought , was like After the Ball Is Over . It had always been like that . " After the Ball , " he thought , would be an excellent name for the damned thing : that had always been the effect it had produced on him . It had never been a home , never a place to come back to at night , and find rest and peace and warmth and homeliness and comfort . No , it had always been the cold mausoleum of departed guests ; a great , frigid , splendid , and completely lifeless temple to the memory of the glittering and fashionable parties which should have been given here last night , but which probably had not occurred . Thus , the greatp177house was haunted constantly by the haughty ghosts of stuffedshirtdomand dog-collardom ; but by the presences of living warmth , familiar usage , genial homeliness  --  never ! The great marble steps with their magnificent sweep , the marble entrance hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mournfully , fading again into a melancholy staleness , mustiness , and frigid loneliness after the rustling silks and satins , the blazing chandeliers , the refined and cultivated voices , the silvery laughter and the champagne bubbles , the dog-collars , ropes of pearls , bare backs , stiff shirts , and glowing shoulders of last night 's splendid gathering had departed . All that was needed to complete the illusion was a corps of caterer 's men  --  twenty or thirty swarthy little fellows in monkey suits marching in to clear up the litter of the party  --  the empty champagne glasses , salad dishes , the cigar butts ; the ashes on the carpet , and the filaments of colored paper hanging from the chandeliers  --  tattered remnants of the ball . James sighed a little , then turned brusquely and marched down the hall into the great dining room . The dining room , too , was splendid and magnificent  --  cold , cold , cold  --  like eating in a tomb . The room was on the west side of the house : the morning sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a somber polished slab , the large buffet , resplendent as a coffin , set with massive plate . At one end of the enormous table , a great high-backed chair , of carved and somber darkness , a big plate , a great heavy knife and fork and spoon , the slender elegance of a silver coffee pot , a fragile purity of cups and saucers , another plate domed richly with an enormous silver warming-cover , a glass of orange juice , and stiff , heavy , spotless napery . James seated himself down there , a lonely little figure at thepI78 end of the enormous table  --  and surveyed the feast . First he looked at the glass of orange juice , raised it to his lips , shuddered , and set it down . Then , gingerly , he lifted the great silver warming-lid and peered beneath the cover : three thin brown slices of dry toast lay chastely on a big white plate . James let the silver cover fall with a large clatter . Sugarlips appeared . James poured black fluid from the coffee pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted his firm mouth , he said : " What is this stuff ? " " Coffee , sir , " said Sugarlips . " Coffee ? " said James coldly . " A new coffee , sir , " breathed Sugarlips , " that has no caffein in it . " James made no answer , but his cold blue eyes were bright and hard , and , nodding toward the covered dish , he spoke coldly , tonelessly , as before : " And this ? " " Your toast , sir , " breathed Sugarlips moistly . " My toast ? " James inquired , in the same cold and unpersuaded tone . " Yes , sir , " breathed Sugarlips . " Your toast  --  dry toast , sir . " " Oh , no , " said James grimly , " you 're wrong there . It 's , not my toast  --  dry toast has never been my toast ! . . . What 's this ? " he said with brutal suddenness , jerking his head toward the glass of orange juice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , no , " said James , more cold and grim than ever . " It 's not my fruit juice . You 're wrong again ! You never saw me drink it yet . " For a moment he surveyed the butler with blue blazing eyes . Cold fury choked him . " Look here , " he rasped suddenly , " what the hell 's the meaning of all this ? Where 's my breakfast ? You told me it was ready ! "  | " Begging your pardon , sir  --  " Sugarlips began , dilating his full lips moistly . " Begging my pardon , hell ! " cried James , and threw his napkin to the floor . " I do n't want my pardon begged  --  I want my breakfast ! Where is it ? " " Yes , sir , " Sugarlips began , and moistened his full lips nervously  --  " butthe doctor , sir  --  the diet he prescribed , sir ! . . . It was the mistress 's orders that you get it , sir . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mine or your mistress 's ? " " Why , yours , sir , " Sugarlips hastily agreed . " Who 's eating it ? " James went on brusquely . " Your mistress or me ? " " Why , you are , sir , " said Sugarlips . " Of course , sir ! " " Then bring it to me ! " shouted James . " At once ! When I needanyone 's help to tell me what I have to eat , I 'll let you know ! " " Yes sir , yes sir , " Sugarlips breathed , all of a twitter now . " Then you desire  --  " " You know what I desire , " James yelled . " I desire my breakfast ! ! At once ! Now ! Right away ! . . . The same breakfast that I always have ! The breakfast that I 've had for forty years ! The breakfast that my father had before me ! The breakfast that a working man has got to have  --  as it was in the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " James shouted . " Namely , a dish of oatmeal , four slices of buttered toast , a plate of ham and eggs , and a pot of coffee  --  strong black coffee  --  real coffee ! " James shouted . " Do you understand ? " " Y-y-yes , sir , " stammered Sugarlips . " P-p-perfectly , sir . " " Then go and get it ! . . . Have you got any real coffee in the house ? " he demanded sharply . " Of course , sir . " " Then bring it ! " James cried , and struck the table . " At once ?  | Now ! . . . And hurry up with it ! I 'll be late to the bank as it is ! " He picked up the folded pages of The Times beside his plate and opened it with a vicious rattle  --  " And take this slop away ! " he barked , as an afterthought , indicating the rejected breakfast with a curt nod . " Do what you like with it  --  throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And he went back savagely to the crisp pages of The Times again . The coffee came in , Sugarlips poured it , and James was just on the point of drinking it when something happened . He bent forward sharply , ready with the cup of real right coffee almost to his lips , grunted suddenly with surprise , put the cup down sharply , and leaned forward with the paper tightly gripped in his two hands , reading intently . What he read  --  what caught and held his startled interest  --  ran as follows : ACTRESS SUES SUNDAY SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT , CLAIMING HEART BALMNotice of suit was filed yesterday before Mr. Justice McGoniglein an action for breach of promise brought by Mrs. Margaret Hall Davis , 37 , against W. Wainwright Parsons , 58 . Mr. Parsons is well known as the author of many books on religious subjects , and for the past fifteen years he has been Superintendent of the Church School at the fashionable EpiscopalChurch of St. Balthazar , whose vestrymen include such leading citizens of New York as Mr. James Wyman , Sr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly to himself at this linking of his own name with such a scandal . He skimmed swiftly through the list of his fellow vestrymen and read on avidly : Mr. Parsons could not be found last night at the University Club , where he lives . Officials at the club said he had occupied his rooms there until three days ago , when he departed , leav/ing no address . Members of the club , when questioned , expressedsurprise when informed of Mrs. Davis 's suit . Mr. Parsons , they said , was a bachelor of quiet habits , and no one had ever heard of his alleged connection with the actress . Mrs. Davis , interviewed at her Riverside Drive apartment , answered questions willingly . She is a comely blonde of maturecharms , and was formerly , she said , a member of the Ziegfeld Follies , and later a performer on the musical comedy stage . She said that she met the elderly Mr. Parsons two years ago , during a week-end at Atlantic City . Their friendship , she asserted , developed rapidly . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , but requested a postponementuntil New Year 's Day , pleading business and financial difficulties and the illness of a member of his family as reasons for the delay . To this the pretty divorcee agreed , she says , and as a result of his ardent persuasions consented to a temporaryalliance prior to their marriage . Since the first of last October , she asserted , they have occupied the Riverside Drive apartment jointly , and were known to the landlord and the other tenants of the building as " Mr. and Mrs. Parsons . " As the time for their marriage approached , the woman alleges , Mr. Parsons pleaded further complications in his personalaffairs , and asked for another postponement until Easter . To this she also agreed , still confident of the sincerity of his intentions . Early in March , however , he left the apartment , telling her he had been called to Boston on business , but would return in a few days . Since that time , she says , she has not seen him , and all efforts to communicate with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reply to repeated letters from her , Mr. Parsons finally wrote her three weeks ago , stating it would now be impossible for him to fulfill his promise of marriage and suggesting that " for the good of all concerned , we call the whole thing off . " This , Mrs. Davis asserted , she is unwilling to do . " I loved Willy , " she declared , with tears in her eyes . " God is my witness that I loved him with the deepest , purest love a woman ever had to give a man . And Willy loved me , loves me still . I know he does . I am sure of it ! If you could only see the letters that he wrote me  --  I have dozens of them here "  --  she indicated a thick packet of letters on the table , tied with a pink ribbon  --  " the most passionate and romantic letters any lover ever wrote , " she declared . " Willy was a wonderfullover  --  so gentle , so tender , so poetic  --  and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ! " she passionatelydeclared . " I will not ! I love him still in spite of everything that has happened . I am willing to forgive all , forget all  --  if only he will come back to me . " The actress is suing for damages of one hundred thousand dollars . The firm of Hoggenheimer , Blaustein , Glutz , and Levy , of 11 r Broadway , are her legal representatives . Mr. Parsons is well known for his books in the religious field . According to Who 's Who , he was born in Lima , Ohio , April 19 , 1871 , the son of the Reverend Samuel Abner Parsons , and the late Martha Elizabeth Bushmiller Parsons . Educated at De Pauw University , and later at the Union Theological Seminary , he was himself ordained to the ministry in 1897 , and during the next ten years filled successive pulpits in Fort Wayne , Indiana , Pottstown , Pennsylvania , and Elizabeth , New Jersey .

He is the author of more than a score of books on devotional subjects , several of which have run through repeated editions , and one of which , a travel book , Afoot In The Holy Land , enjoyed a tremendous sale not only in this country but abroad . Some of his other works , according to Who 's Who , are as follows : Following After the Master ( 1907 ) ; Almost Thou PersuadestMe ( 1908 ) ; Job 's Comforters ( 19o9 ) ; Who Follows in His Train ( 1910 ) ; For They Shall See God ( 1912 ) ; Jordan and the Marne ( 1915 ) ; Armageddon and Verdun ( 1917 ) ; Christianity and the Fuller Life ( 1921 ) ; The Way of Temptation(1927) ; The Song of Solomon ( 1927 ) ; Behold , He Cometh(1928).  |p183James  saw the item just as he had been bending forward to sip his coffee .

He tore through the column , ripping splintered fragments from the thing  --  all he needed !  --  until he had it clear and blazing in his mind . Then for a moment , after he had finished , he sat completely motionless , with a look of utter stupefaction on his face . Finally he raised the outspread paper in both hands , banged it down emphatically on the table , leaned back in his great chair , stared straight and far and viewlesslyacross the enormous polished vista of the table , and said slowly and with emphasis : " I'l l  --  be  --  God  --  damned ! " Just then Sugarlips came in with the oatmeal , smoking hot , and slid it unctuously before him . James slashed thick cream all over it , spread sugar with a copious spoon , and dug in savagely .

When he got up to go , he had composed himself , but his bright blue eyes were as hard and cold as glacial ice and the suggestion of a faint grim grin about the edges of his mouth was sharper , finer , more deadly than it had ever been before . He looked at the paper , growled impatiently , started for the door , paused , turned round , looked back , came back growling , picked up the paper , thrust it angrily into his pocket , and marched down the enormous hall . He paused at the entrance , took a derby hat and placed it firmly , a trifle jauntily , and at an angle on his well-shaped head , stepped down and opened the enormous front door , went out and down the street at a brisk pace , turned left , and so into Fifth Avenue . To one side , the Park and young greening trees ; in the roadway , the traffic beginning to thicken and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly ahead , the frontal blaze and cliff of the terrific city , and morning , shining morning , on the tall towers  --  while an old man with cold-blazing eyes went sprucely swinging through the canyoned slant , muttering to himself :  --  Following After the Master Bah !  --  Almost Thou Persuadest Me  --  Bahl  --  The Way of TemptationSuddenly he whipped the folded newspaper out of his pocket , turned it over , and peered intently at the story again , comparing dates .

I did n't know he had it in him ! "  | MY LIFE , MORE THAN THAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wandering . Why this is true , or how it happened , I can not say ; yet it is so . From my fifteenth year  --  save for a single interval  --  I have lived about as solitary a life as a modern man can have . I mean by this that the number of hours , days , months , and years that I have spent alone has been immense and extraordinary . I propose , therefore , to describe the experience of human loneliness exactly as I have known it . The reason that impels me to do this is not that I think my knowledge of loneliness different in kind from that of other men . Quite the contrary . The whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief that loneliness , far from being a rare and curious phenomenon , peculiar to myself and to a few other solitarymen , is the central and inevitable fact of human existence . When we examine the moments , acts , and statements of all kinds of people  --  not only the grief and ecstasy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average soul , as evidenced by the innumerable strident words of abuse , hatred , contempt , mistrust , and scorn that forever grate upon our ears as the manswarm passes us in the streets  --  we find , I think , that they are all suffering from the same thing . The final cause of their complaint is loneliness . But if my experience of loneliness has not been different in kind from that of other men , I suspect it has been sharper in intensity . This gives me the best authority in the world to writep187of this , our general complaint , for I believe I know more about it than anyone of my generation . In saying this , I am merely stating a fact as I see it , though I realize that it may sound like arrogance or vanity . But before anyone jumps to that conclusion , let him consider how strange it would be to meet with arrogance in one who has lived alone as much as I. The surest cure for vanity is loneliness . For , more than other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the victims of self-doubt . Foreverand forever in our loneliness , shameful feelings of inferiority will rise up suddenly to overwhelm us in a poisonous flood of horror , disbelief , and desolation , to sicken and corrupt our health and confidence , to spread pollution at the very root of strong , exultant joy . And the eternal paradox of it is that if a man is to know the triumphant labor of creation , he must for long periods resign himself to loneliness , and suffer loneliness to rob him of the health , the confidence , the belief and joy which are essential to creative work . To live alone as I have lived , a man should have the confidence of God , the tranquil faith of a monastic saint , the stern impregnabilityof Gibraltar . Lacking these , there are times when anything , everything , all or nothing , the most trivial incidents , the most casual words , can in an instant strip me of my armor , palsy my hand , constrict my heart with frozen horror , and fill my bowels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing but a shadow passing on the sun ; sometimesnothing but the torrid milky light of August , or the naked , sprawling ugliness and squalid decencies of streets in Brooklyn fading in the weary vistas of that milky light and evoking the intolerable misery of countless drab and nameless lives . Sometimes it is just the barren horror of raw concrete , or the heat blazing on a million beetles of machinery darting through the torrid streets , or the cindered weariness of parking spaces , or the slamming smash and racket of the El , or the driven manswarm of the earth , thrusting on forever in exacerbatedfury , going nowhere in a hurry . Again , it may be just a phrase , a look , a gesture . It may be the cold , disdainful inclination of the head with which a precious , kept , exquisite princeling of Park Avenue acknowledges an introduction , as if to say : " You are nothing . " Or it may be a sneeringreference and dismissal by a critic in a high-class weekly magazine . Or a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my talent vanished , all my efforts false and worthless  --  since I have forsaken the truth , vision , and reality which are so beautifullyher own . And sometimes it is less than these  --  nothing I can touch or see or hear or definitely remember . It may be so vague as to be a kind of hideous weather of the soul , subtly compounded of all the hunger , fury , and impossible desire my life has ever known . Or , again , it may be a half-forgotten memory of the cold wintry red of waning Sunday afternoons in Cambridge , and of a pallid , sensitive , aesthetic face that held me once in earnest discourse on such a Sunday afternoon in Cambridge , telling me that all my youthful hopes were pitiful delusions and that all my life would come to naught , and the red and waning light of March was reflected on the pallid face with a desolate impotence that instantlyquenched all the young ardors of my blood . Beneath the evocations of these lights and weathers , and the cold , disdainful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the joy and singing of the day goes out like an extinguished candle , hope seems lost to me forever , and every truth that I have ever found and known seems false . At such a time the lonely man will feel that all the evidence of his own senses has betrayed him , and that nothing really lives and moves on earth but creatures of the death-in-life  --  those of the cold ,  |p189constricted  heart and the sterile loins , who exist forever in the red waning light of March and Sunday afternoon . All this hideous doubt , despair , and dark confusion of the soul a lonely man must know , for he is united to no image save that which he creates himself , he is bolstered by no other knowledge save that which he can gather for himself with the vision of his own eyes and brain . He is sustained and cheered and aided by no party , he is given comfort by no creed , he has no faith in him except his own . And often that faith deserts him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it seems to him that his life has come to nothing , that he is ruined , lost , and broken past redemption , and that morning  --  bright , shining morning , with its promise of new beginnings  --  will never come upon the earth again as it did once . He knows that dark time is flowing by him like a river . The huge , dark wall of loneliness is around him now . It encloses and presses in upon him , and he can not escape . And the cancerousplant of memory is feeding at his entrails , recalling hundreds of forgotten faces and ten thousand vanished days , until all life seems as strange and insubstantial as a dream . Time flows by him like a river , and he waits in his little room like a creature held captive by an evil spell . And he will hear , far off , the murmurous drone of the great earth , and feel that he has been forgotten , that his powers are wasting from him while the river flows , and that all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength is gone , his power withered , while he sits there drugged and fettered in the prison of his loneliness . Then suddenly , one day , for no apparent reason , his faith and his belief in life will come back to him in a tidal flood . It will rise up in him with a jubilant and invincible power , bursting a window in the world 's great wall and restoring everything to shapes of deathless brightness . Made miraculously whole.  |p190and  secure in himself , he will plunge once more into the triumphantlabor of creation . All his old strength is his again : he knows what he knows , he is what he is , he has found what he has found . And he will say the truth that is in him , speak it even though the whole world deny it , affirm it though a million men cry out that it is false . At such a moment of triumphant confidence , with this feeling in me , I dare now assert that I have known Loneliness as well as any man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very brother , which he is . I will paint him for you with such fidelity to his true figure that no man who reads will ever doubt his visage when Loneliness comes to him hereafter . The most tragic , sublime , and beautiful expression of human loneliness which I have ever read is the Book of job ; the grandest and most philosophical , Ecclesiastes . Here I must point out a fact which is so much at variance with everything I was told as a child concerning loneliness and the tragic underweft of life that , when I first discovered it , I was astounded and incredulous , doubting the overwhelming weight of evidence that had revealedit to me . But there it was , as solid as a rock , not to be shaken or denied ; and as the years passed , the truth of this discoverybecame part of the structure of my life . The fact is this : the lonely man , who is also the tragic man , is invariably the man who loves life dearly  --  which is to say , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever . The one condition implies the other , and makes it necessary . The essence of human tragedy is in loneliness , not in conflict , no matter what the arguments of the theater may assert . And just as the great tragic writer ( I say , " the tragic writer " as distinguishedfrom " the writer of tragedies , " for certain nations , the Roman and French among them , have had no great tragicp191writers , for Vergil and Racine were none , but rather great writers of tragedy ) : just as the great tragic writer  --  Job , Sophocles , Dante , Milton , Swift , Dostoevski  --  has always been the lonely man , so has he also been the man who loved life best and had the deepest sense of joy . The real quality and substance of human joy is to be found in the works of these great tragic writers as nowhere else in all the records of man 's life upon the earth . In proof of this , I can give here one conclusive illus-tration : In my childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind a long train of gloomy , gray , and unbrokenly dismal associations . This has been true , I suspect , with most of us . Such phrases as " Job 's comforter , " and " the patience of Job , " and " the afflictions of Job , " have become part of our commonidiom and are used to refer to people whose woes seem uncountableand unceasing , who have suffered long and silently , and whose gloom has never been interrupted by a ray of hope or joy . All these associations had united to make for me a picture of the Book of Job that was grim , bleak , and constant in its misery . When I first read it as a child , it seemed to me that the record of job 's tribulations was relieved only by a kind of gloomy and unwilling humor  --  a humor not intended by the author , but supplied by my own exasperation , for my childish sense of proportion and justice was at length so put upon by this dreary tidal flood of calamities that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence and experience who has react that great book in his mature years will realize how false such a picture is . For the Book of Job , far from being dreary , gray , and dismal , is woven entire , more than any single piece of writing I can recall , from the sensuous , flashing , infinitely various , and gloriously palpable material of great poetry ; and it wears at the heart of its tremendous chant of everlasting sorrow the exulting song of everlasting joy . In this there is nothing strange or curious , but only what is inevitable and right . For the tragic writer knows that joy is rooted at the heart of sorrow , that ecstasy is shot through with the sudden crimson thread of pain , that the knife-thrust of intolerable desire and the wild , brief glory of possession are pierced most bitterly , at the very instant of man 's greatest victory , by the premonitory sense of loss and death . So seen and so felt , the best and worst that the human heart can know are merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both together , into the tragic web of life . It is the sense of death and loneliness , the knowledge of the brevity of his days , and the huge impending burden of his sorrow , growing always , never lessening , that makes joy glorious , tragic , and unutterably precious to a man like Job . Beauty comes and passes , is lost the moment that we touch it , can no more be stayed or held than one can stay the flowing of a river . Out of this pain of loss , this bitter ecstasy of brief having , this fatal glory of the single moment , the tragic writer will therefore make a song for joy . That , at least , he may keep and treasure always . And his song is full of grief , because he knows that joy is fleeting , gone the instant that we have it , and that is why it is so precious , gaining its full glory from the very things that limit and destroy it . He knows that joy gains its glory out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , that it is haunted always with the certainty of death , dark death , which stops our tongues , our eyes , our living breath , with the twin oblivions of dust and nothingness . Therefore a man like Job will make a chant for sorrow , too , but it will still be a song for joy as well , and onep193more strange and beautiful than any other that man has ever sung : Hast thou given the horse strength ? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder ? Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper ? the glory of his nostrils is terrible . He paweth in the valley , and rejoiceth in his strength : he goeth on to meet the armed men . He mocketh at fear , and is not affrighted ; neither turneth he back from the sword . The quiver rattleth against him , the glittering spear and the shield . He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage ; neither believethhe that it is the sound of the trumpet . He saith among the trumpets , Ha , ha ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the captains , and the shouting . That is joy joy solemn and triumphant ; stern , lonely , everlastingjoy , which has in it the full depth and humility of man 's wonder , his sense of glory , and his feeling of awe before the mystery of the universe . An exultant cry is torn from our lips as we read the lines about that glorious horse , and the joy we feel is wild and strange , lonely and dark like death , and grander than the delicate and lovely joy that men like Herrick and Theocritus described , great poets though they were . Just as the Book of job and the sermon of Ecclesiastes arc , each in its own way , supreme histories of man 's loneliness , so do all the books of the Old Testament , in their entirety , pro vide the most final and profound literature of human loneliness that the world has known . It is astonishing with what a coherent unity of spirit and belief the life of loneliness is recorded in those many books  --  how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophecies , and chronicles of so many men , all so various , and each so individual , each revealing some new image of man ' .  |p194secret  and most lonely heart , and all combining to produce a single image of his loneliness that is matchless in its grandeur and magnificence . Thus , in a dozen books of the Old Testament  --  in Job , Ecclesiastes , and the Song of Solomon ; in Psalms , Proverbs , and Isaiah ; in words of praise and words of lamentation ; in songs of triumph and in chants of sorrow , bondage , and despair ; in boasts of pride and arrogant assertion , and in stricken confessionsof humility and fear ; in warning , promise , and in prophecy ; in love , hate , grief , death , loss , revenge , and resignation ; in wild , singing jubilation and in bitter sorrow  --  the lonely man has wrought out in a swelling and tremendous chorus the final vision of his life . The total , all-contributary unity of this conception of man 's loneliness in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we begin to read the New . For , just as the Old Testament becomes the chronicle of the life of loneliness , the gospels of the New Testament , with the same miraculous and unswerving unity , become the chronicle of the life of love . What Christ is saying always , what he never swerves from saying , what he says a thousand times and in a thousand different ways , but always with a central unity of belief , is this : " I am my Father 's son , and you are my brothers . " And the unity that binds us all together , that makes this earth a family , and all men brothers and the sons of God , is love . The central purpose of Christ 's life , therefore , is to destroy the life of loneliness and to establish here on earth the life of love . The evidence to support this is clear and overwhelming . It should be obvious to everyone that when Christ says : " Blessed are the poor in spirit : for theirs is the kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : for they shall be comforted , " " Blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth , " " Blessedp195are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled , " " Blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy , " and Blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see God "  --  Christ is not here extolling the qualities of humility , sorrow , meekness , righteousness , mercy , and purity as virtues sufficient in themselves , but he promises to men who have these virtues the richest reward that men were ever offered . And what is that reward ? It is a reward that promises not only the inheritance of the earth , but the kingdom of heaven as well . It tells men that they shall not live and die in loneliness , that their sorrow will not go unassuaged , their prayers unheard , their hunger and thirst unfed , their love unrequited : but that , through love , they shall destroy the walls of loneliness forever ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grind them down into the dust , yet if they bear all things meekly and with love , they will enter into a fellowship of joy , a brotherhood of love , such as no men on earth ever knew before . Such was the final intention of Christ 's life , the purpose of his teaching . And its total import was that the life of loneliness could be destroyed forever by the life of love . Or such , at least , has been the meaning which I read into his life . For in these recent years when I have lived alone so much , and known lonelinessso well , I have gone back many times and read the story of this man 's words and life to see if I could find in them a meaningfor myself , a way of life that would be better than the one I had . I read what he had said , not in a mood of piety or holiness , not from a sense of sin , a feeling of contrition , or because his promise of a heavenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read his bare words nakedly and simply , as it seems to me he must have uttered them , and as I have read the words of other men  --  of Homer , Donne , and Whitman , and the writer of Ecclesiastes  --  and if the meaning I have put upon his words seems foolish or extravagant , childishly simple or banal , mine alone or not different from what ten million other men have thought , I have only set it down here as I saw it , felt it , found it for myself , and have tried to add , subtract , and alter nothing . And now I know that though the way and meaning of Christ 's life is a far , far better way and meaning than my own , yet I can never make it mine ; and I think that this is true of all the other lonely men that I have seen or known about  --  the nameless , voiceless , faceless atoms of this earth as well as job and Everyman and Swift . And Christ himself , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any man that ever lived . Yet I could not say that he was mistaken because he preached the life of love and fellowship , and lived and died in loneliness ; nor would I dare assert his way was wrong because a billion men have since professed his way and never followed it . I can only say that I could not make his way my own . For I have found the constant , everlasting weather of man 's life to be , not love , but loneliness . Love itself is not the weather of our lives . It is the rare , the precious flower . Sometimes it is the flower that gives us life , that breaches the dark walls of all our loneliness and restores us to the fellowship of life , the family of the earth , the brotherhood of man . But sometimes love is the flower that brings us death ; and from it we get pain and darkness ; and the mutilations of the soul , the maddening of the brain , may be in it . How or why or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , whether with life or death , triumph or defeat , joy or madness , no man on this earth can say . But I know that at the end , forever at the end for us  --  the houseless , homeless , doorless , driven wanderers of life , the lonely men  --  there waits forever the dark visage of our comrade , Loneliness . But the old refusals drop away , the old avowals stand  --  and wep197who were dead have risen , we who were lost are found again , and we who sold the talent , the passion , and belief of youth into the keeping of the fleshless dead , until our hearts were corrupted , our talent wasted , and our hope gone , have won our lives back bloodily , in solitude and darkness ; and we know that things will be for us as they have been , and we see again , as we saw once , the image of the shining city . Far flung , and blazinginto tiers of jeweled light , it burns forever in our vision as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round it , and the great ships call . And we walk the Bridge , always we walk the Bridge alone with you , stern friend , the one to whom we speak , who never failed us . Hear : " Loneliness forever and the earth again ! Dark brother and stern friend , immortal face of darkness and of night , with whom the half part of my life was spent , and with whom I shall abide now till my death forever  --  what is there for me to fear as long as you are with me ? Heroic friend , blood-brother of my life , dark face  --  have we not gone together down a million ways , have we not coursed together the great and furious avenues of night , have we not crossed the stormy seas alone , and known strange lands , and come again to walk the continent of night and listen to the silence of the earth ? Have we not been brave and glorious when we were together , friend ? Have we not known triumph , joy , and glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me as it was then , if you come back to me ? Come to me , brother , in the watches of the night . Come to me in the secret and most silent heart of darkness . Come to me as you always came , bringing to me again the old invincible strength , the deathless hope , the triumphant joy and confidence that will storm the earth again . " The Hills Beyond ABOUT MIDWAY ALONG THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD OF THE NORTH American continent lies a strip of land which is known today as the State of Old Catawba . It is an ancient part of the everlasting earth , but its history is quite young . One of the earliest references to it occurs in the chronicle of old Hugh Fortescue . His narrative is so well known that it would hardly bear recounting , were it not for the curious legend which has grown out of it . In the month of September , 1593 , Fortescue , one of the hardiest and most celebrated sea adventurers of the time , set sail from Plymouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in addition to his crew , a company of one hundred and seven men , women , and children , whom he proposed to land upon the shores of Old Catawba to establish a colony there . The colony , as everyone knows , was founded four months later , in January , 1594 . According to Fortescue 's account , he remained for two months , helping the colonists build huts and log houses ; then Fortescue sailed for England , leaving the colony apparently well established , with everything going briskly . It was the old sea dog 's intention , as he tells us in his lusty chronicle , to return again early the following year with additional supplies for the settlers , and with the further purpose , of course , of collecting and taking home the first fruits of their crops or202 THE HILLS BEYONDp202findings in the New World . Troubles at home , however , delayed him far beyond his reckoning , and it was August , 1595 , before he stood in past the shifting dunes again , into the pearl gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months late . And everyone knows what he found . The settlement was still there , but all the people had disappeared . The natural supposition was that they had been massacred by the Indians . Curiously , however , the rude huts and cabins were intact . Fortescue says that they had been stripped of every utensil , ornament , and stick of furniture that might conceivably be of use to anyone , but there was no evidence of violence . The whole place was just empty and deserted . And , nailed to a tree at the edge of the clearing , was a kind of rude sign on which had been crudely painted the word " here "  --  or " heare , " as it was actually spelled . Below , an arrowhead , blazed in the bark , pointed toward the wilderness . This was all . Fortescue and his men , taking this clue for what it was worth , or what it might imply , explored the wilderness of the whole region for weeks . They found nothing  --  not even a footprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people in the settlement . So , after exhausting every hope and every possibility of search , Fortescue set sail again and headed back for England . That 's the story  --  all that was ever known . No new light has since been shed upon the mystery . But the human mind is so constructed that it can not abide an unresolved mystery . From Fortescue 's day onward , people wondered what became of the Lost Colony , and since history gave no answer , they were free to invent an answer of their own . This , as we shall shortly see , is exactly what they did . Time passed , and other settlers came to Old Catawba . Thep203manner of their coming was very much like that by which all the colonies of the British Crown were eventually peopled . And like the nation of which it was to be a part , Old Catawba grew from cast to west . Its expansion followed the inevitable direction prescribed by geography and economic pressure . The earliest settlementswere in the tide-water regions along the coast . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceed ten thousand persons , and they were distributed in a thin belt of settlements that penetrated no more than seventy-five or a hundred miles inland . One hundred years later , just before the outbreak of the Revolutionary War , the population had grown to two hundred thousand , and had pushed westward to the foothills of the upper Piedmont , at the base of the great mountain wall , three hundred and fifty miles from the ocean . Intrepid pioneers and daring huntsmen had actually surmounted the last barrier of the West , had blazed their way through the wilderness , had lived for months alone in what was then Indian country , and had returned at length laden with furs and skins and other trophies of the hunt , as token of the fact that they had been there . The first settlements behind the mountain wall , in the great wilderness of western Catawba , occurred in the years immediately following the Revolution , and as a direct result of the war : the settlers were men who had been soldiers in the Continental Army , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as a reward for their services . Slowly but surely the movement to the West continued , until by the first quarter of the nineteenth century the western regions of the state had so grown in numbers that they threatened to wrest control of the government from the East , which had hitherto maintained its supremacy unchallenged . The West demandedits rightful representation in the legislature . The Eau ,  | stiffnecked with pride , refused , and since the East still had the edge in population , as well as most of the wealth , the refusal stood . Thus began the first in the long series of conflicts between East and West that were to disturb the life of the state for years . But it was an unequal struggle , and time was with the West . The East fought back desperately against this giant stripling , this obscure country cousin , this uncouth hillbilly , but the West , with gangling stride and dangling arms and gap-toothed grin , refused to know when it was licked , and instead just wiped the lank hair from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept coming on again after every knockdown . The East used every weapon at its command , and when fair means failed , it did not scruple to use foul . One of the foulest and most specious weapons that it used was the arrogant claim that the East was superior to the West in birth and breeding , and therefore born to rule . Now the history of genealogies is very significant and curious . In America , as in most young countries , people are much less likely to be snobs over the thing they have than over the thing they lack . Thus , Americans are seldom snobs about money , but they are often snobs about " family . " The amount of time spent by certain people in New England and the South in talking about their " families " is appalling . In the South , particularly , this preoccupation seems to absorb most of the spare energies of the female population , for it is an axiom of Southern life that a woman without " family " is nothing . A woman may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ) ; she may have read nothing , seen nothing , gone nowhere ; she may be lazy , nasty , vain , arrogant , venomous , and dishonest ; her standards of morality , government , justice may not differ one whit from that of the lynching mob : but if she can assert , loudly and withoutchallenge , that her " family " is older ( and therefore better )  |p205than  other families , then her position in the community is unquestioned , she is the delicate flower of " Southern culture , " she must not be " talked back to "  --  she is , in short , " a lady . " So it was in this final phase of the war between the East and the West . As a last resort , the East claimed the right to rule the West on grounds of " family . " In a state which had hitherto been singularly free of aristocratic pretensions this was a most peculiar development . But the reasons for it are not far to seek . The East now knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , and now it saw that it must yield before the new men of the West . It read the signs of its declining influence , and hated to think of the future . So , as nearly always happens under such circumstances , the East took refuge in the glories of an imagined past as compensation for the threatened loss of its future . What happened was this : The bare facts of the Lost Colony , as old Hugh Fortescue recorded them , had been known for years to the more literate people in the eastern part of the state . The mystery surrounding the disappearance of those first colonists had always been a subject of speculation , and a body of legend had grown up about it . According to this legend , the people of that colony were not killed , but were taken captive and carried off into the wilderness by an Indian tribe . In the course of time they adopted the language and customs of their captors ; they intermarried with the Indians and bore children ; and these children , in turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lost Colony was not really lost at all . And it followed from the legend that the descendantsof this colony were not only still living , but could lay claim to the oldest English ancestry of any people in the New World  --  dating thirteen years before Jamestown , and twenty-six before Plymouth.  |p206For  years , this legend had existed as folklore , kept alive by idle curiosity and gossip . No one believed it . It was not until about a decade before the Civil War , at a time when the legends of Massachusetts and Virginia were already venerable with tradition , that the Catawba legend began to congeal into a form imposing enough for anyone to take it seriously . Then it was that a professor of history at one of the local colleges published a book entitled The History of the Lost Colony . It achieved some passing notice in the world at large , being generally received in learned circles as a fairly interesting experiment in conjectural possibility . The author himself did not make any greater claim for it . He was too conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legend of the colonists ' survival through intermarriage with the Indians was anything more than a theory of what might have happened . Still , in a manner that is distressingly familiar to the local historian everywhere , he sometimeslet his patriotic ardor get the better of his scholarly judgment , and , in modern parlance , was inclined " to give himself the breaks . " No doubt it was for this reason that the book produced a considerable sensation at home . Its sales in Old Catawba were phenomenal , and its effect was both profound and startling , in a way that the worthy professor had never intended or foreseen . The time was ripe for it , and people in the eastern part of the state fell upon the book eagerly , and began straightway to embroider and to weave , as composers do , with what are called " improvisations on a theme . " The ladies proved themselves especiallyproficient in this form of intellectual exercise . Starting from scratch  --  indeed , from the most scratchy sort of scratch  --  they began to erect a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , out of something which started merely as a titillating thought , grew rapidly to a rosy hope , and ended in anp207unshakable conviction that they themselves were descended from the presumptive survivors of the Lost Colony . In almost no time at all a new and highly exclusive social organization came into being , calling itself The Society of the Sons and Daughters of the Aborigines . The aristocratic pretensions of its members threatened overnight to eclipse even the haughty claims of the F. F. V. 's and the Mayflower descendants . The Sons and Daughters of the Aborigines had just discovered who they were , and from this point on they would play second fiddle to no one . No doubt it was all well enough , they said patronizingly , to talk about royal grants and tide-water plantations and the early days of Plymouth , but such trifling originalities as these could not be expected to matter very greatly to people who were aboriginally descended from the first English colonists and from Indian chieftains . It was quite surprising to see how proudly the Aborigines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veins . Ladies whose husbands would have reached for their dueling pistols at any imputation of a recent tinge of color in their blood telt no hesitation whatever in proclaiming their dusky ancestors of some two and a half centuries before . There have been critics unkind enough to suggest that throughoutthis whole extraordinary performance necessity was the mother of invention , and that the ready acceptance of the Catawba legend as historic fact was no more than might have been expectedof a people who had too long been irked by their own obscurity and too long been indifferent to the claims of " family . " Thus , " a lady of family " in Virginia is known to have remarked one time , when informed that her nephew had married a mere nobody for no other reason than because he loved her : " Well , what else can you expect ? He was brought up in Johnsville , and that 's practically a Catawba town . " This shrewd observation reflects pretty much the estimation in which Old Catawba has been commonly held by outsiders . And certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been more distinguished for its homespun ruggedness than for its aristocratic splendor . In spite of all gibes and taunts , The Society of the Sons and Daughters of the Aborigines grew strong and flourished throughout the eastern part of the state . And what had begun as a social organization quickly became the chief ally of entrenched power in the state 's politics . The Sons and Daughters brought up their heaviest artillery of " family " to stem the rising tide of the West , and in the pivotal campaign of 1858 they nominated one of their own number to run for Governor against a country lawyer from the wilds of Zebulon County . The country lawyer stumped the state , pleading the cause of democracy , and telling his audiences that the ruling caste in the East , with its money and privileges and humbug aristocracy , was dead and did n't know it . Like Swift when he announced the death of Partridge , the almanac maker , his logic was irrefutable : for , as Swift retorted , when Partridge came forward to assert that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should have been  --  so the country lawyer held to the proposition that the East was dead , or should be ; and his delighted followers called the fight that ensued " The Battle of the Quick and the Dead . " Under that banner the East was beaten . The West had won at last . And the leader and hero of that victory became from that time on the symbol of the West . His name was Zachariah Joyner  --  a name famous to everyone who since that time has lived upon Catawba earth and breathed Catawba air . Throughout his life he was a vigorous and undaunted champion of the common people . The pretensions of the Aborigines disgusted him , and he let no opportunity go by top209flail them with the brutal lash of his coarse but devastating ridicule . Joyner 's opponent in the campaign for the governorship was himself a Son of the Aborigines , his right to this distinction being founded upon the aristocratic claims of his mother , a charming lady who had inherited money and idleness , both together , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trace her ancestry back to the Lost Colony . Her son had campaignedvigorously to save what he called " our precious heritage " and " the Catawba way of life " from the raw crudeness of a Western victory . In the end he was even rash enough to accept Joyner 's challenge to appear on the same platform and debate the issues face to face . On this occasion the gentleman-champion of the East gave everything he had . He was not only eloquent in his show of filial devotion to his mother  --  " that delicate flower of Southern womanhood , etc. . . . to whom I owe , etc. . . . at whose knees I learned , etc. "  --  but he also sought to endear himself to the masses by condescension : he went so far as to admit that he made no claims to aristocratic lineage on his father 's side , his father 's people being descended , so he said , " from good old yeoman stock . " " Good old yeoman stock , my ! " bellowed Zachariah Joyner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England were crowded , and to keep from being hanged "  --  this was an exaggeratedreference to the settlement of a group of exiled convicts on the eastern coast in 1683  --  " and the only yeomen they ever saw were the yoemen of the guard ! " So Zachariah Joyner won , and his victory was a great deal more than the triumph of one half of the state over the other half . It was the triumph of the common man  --  of all the obscure and unknown lives that somewhere had turned a wheel , or swung an ax , or plowed a furrow , or blazed a trail and made a clear-2I0 THE HILLS BEYONDp210ing in the wilderness . His was the voice , the tongue , the language of every one of these who had lived and died and gone unrecorded to the earth  --  and who now arose again , incarnate in one living man , to say to all proud hearts , stiff necks , and Aborigines soever that in the final reckoning the representatives of privilege must bow before the insistent rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | ZACHARIAH JOYNER WAS NEVER ONE TO INDULGE IN THE REVERENT pruning of family trees . When he was Governor of Old Catawba he often said that if people in the eastern part of thestate would spend less time in thinking about where they came from , and more in thinking about where they were going , they would be a lot easier to get along with . He was also impatient of all attempts to dignify himself and his own family genealogically . In the heyday of his later fame , the Aborigines made some conciliating overtures to bring Catawba 's most distinguished citizen into the fold . They did not quite dare hint that Zack had as good a right as anybody else to claim an ancestor in the Lost Colony , for they knew too well what he would say to that ; but they did draw up quite a formidable account of the doings of the Joyners in the annals of history . They traced the name back to the Middle Ages . They even had one of the Joyners doing valiant service in defense of King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was surrounded by a murderous host of Saracens before the walls of old Jerusalem . They dug out others with baronial titles , and found some of them contending back and forth in the Wars of the Roses . There were Joyners who had fought loyally under the banners of King Charles , and others just as doggedly with Cromwell 's men . From that point the earliest migrations of the family were2I2 THE HILLS BEYONDp212traced to Virginia , thence to the coastal regions of Catawba , and finally to their stronghold in the mountain districts of the West . By dint of much contriving , the whole thing had been linked together in a kind of chain . But Zachariah was not impressed . His comment on the document , when it was presented for his inspection and approval , was characteristically blunt and to the point : " I do n't know where we came from , and , what 's more , I do n't give a damn . The point is , we 're here now . " There was not only good democracy in this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential trait of the Joyner tribe was in those words . They were " here now , " and Catawba would have been inconceivable without them . They were , in fact , a kind of native dragon seed . They may have had some other and more ancient antecedents , but in their magnificent quality of Now-ness  --  the quality of being what they were because they were where they were  --  they were so naturally a part of western Catawba , its life , its speech , its history , even the clay of its soil , that any other previous existence for them seemed fantastically detached , ghostly , and unreal . Since every mother 's son of us has got to come from somewhere , their lineage , no doubt , went back like everyone 's to Father Adam , or to the origins of primeval man . So perhaps their ancestor was some prehistoric anthropoid . But if anyone wants to know who the founder of the family was , the answer is that it was old William Joyner , the father of Zack , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of old William is still kept alive in the hills , for in his own way he attained a legendary repute which almost equals that of his more celebrated son . There is some doubt about William Joyner 's antecedents , and no certainty whatever about where he came from . It is knownp213that he came to Zebulon County because of a Revolutionary land grant . And the date of his coming is established . It was in 1793 when he took up his grant upon the south fork of what is now known as the Thumb Toe River . If he was not actually the first settler in that region , he was among the first . From this time on , people began to come in rapidly , and when William Joyner married , in 1798 , the wife he took was the daughter of another settler who had recently arrived in the mountains . Her name was Martha Creasman , and by her he had a family of seven . She died at the birth of her last child . Later , William married a second time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for there were so many of them , and their destinies were so diverse , that even their number has been disputed . But of these matters , with all the ramifications of kinship and heredity they imply , it is our purpose to speak later . Here we shall tell a little more of William Joyner . There were , in the earlier years of the present century , old men alive who could remember him ; for he lived to a great old age , and there were people who were children in the 184o 's who had seen him and had heard the stories men told of him . Even at that time , a hundred years ago , he was an almost legendary figure . The stories of his great physical strength , for example , were prodigious , and yet apparently were founded in substantial fact . He was said to have been , particularly in his earlier years , a man of a hot temper , who liked a fight . There is a story of his fight with a big blacksmith : a quarrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , the blacksmith brained him with an iron shoe and knocked him flat . As William started to get up again , bleeding and half conscious , the blacksmith came at him again , and Joyner hit him while still resting on one knee . Thep214blow broke the blacksmith 's ribs and caved in his side as one would crack a shell . He was known in his own day to be a mighty hunter ; and old men who remembered him used to tell of the time he " chased the dogs the whole way over into Tennessee , and was gone four days and nights , and never knowed how fer from home he was . " There is also the story of his fight with a grizzly bear : the bear charged him at close quarters and there was nothing left for him to do but fight . A searching party found him two days later , more dead than living  --  as they told it , " all chawed up , " but with the carcass of the bear : " and in the fight he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off both his years , and that b'ar was so tored up hit was a caution . " Then there is the story of the time when he walked off with enough leather on his back to shoe a regiment . The brother of Joyner 's first wife owned a kind of trading post or country store , and had besides a pound of savage and ferocious dogs . It was the storekeeper 's boast that no one but himself could manage these fierce animals , and certainly no one else had ever attempted to . People generally were afraid of them , and gave them a wide berth . Their owner was so proud of their untamed ferocity that on one occasion , when he was talking of his dogs to a group of men who were in his store , he offered any man who could subdue them " as much leather as he can tote out of here upon his back . " William Joyner was present and instantly accepted the challenge . In spite of the efforts of his friends to dissuade him , he went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opened the gate and went in . The great dogs sprang snarling at him with bared fangs . According to the story , " he jest snapped his fingers once or twice , " and the dogs whimpered and came crawling to him like a pack of curs . To add insult to injury , he is said to havep215stooped down and picked up two of the largest and most savage of the dogs and held them under his arms , " a-hangin ' thar real foolish-like , like a couple of pigs . " After walking about the pen with them a time or two , he tossed them down , snapped his fingersagain , opened the gate , and walked out unscathed . The storekeeper , although beaten and dumbfounded , was as good as his word . He pointed to the pile of leather in his store and told William he could take as much as he could carry . Joyner stood there while his companions heaped the leather on , and finally staggered out the door with eight hundred pounds of it on his shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffice to indicate the unusual qualities of his person , his great strength , and his undaunted courage . He was said by everyone who ever saw him to have been a person of remarkable gifts . Indeed , one does not have to probe a mystery to find an explanation for the amazingfamily he produced : the seed of all their talents was aware in him . Although he came to Zebulon with nothing but his rifle and his grant of land , within twenty years , through his ability as a shrewd trader , he had accumulated what was , in his time and place , a substantial property . He was the owner of a mill , to which his neighbors brought their corn for grinding . He increased his holdings until he owned and had under cultivation hundreds of acres of the most fertile land in the beautiful valley that now bears the name of Joyner 's Creek . And eventually he became the owner of the largest and most flourishing trading post in the whole district . From these beginnings came the start of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later years of his political career , made frequent and eloquent reference , in the phrases of the orotund rhetoric of which he was a master , to " the little log cabin where I was born . " It is further true that the little log cabin where Zachariah so often and so advantageously asserted he was born , still exists , kept piously by the State Historical Commission , in a condition of trimmed , sodded , planted , and be-flowered snugnessthat it assuredly did not know at the time when William Joyner lived in it . The State Highway Commission has likewise memorialized the sanctuary in a system of neat signs , which notify the modern pilgrim that he is now approaching " the birthplaceof Zachariah Joyner  --  four miles . " It is unfortunate , perhaps , both for the lovers of sentiment and the believers in historic fact , that Zachariah was not born here at all . William Joyner did live here for years , and built the cabin with his own hands , with the assistance of some friendly Cherokees ; but by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person of considerable substance , and in accordance not only with his new position , but with the expansive needs of his growingfamily , he had built the larger and much more substantial dwelling that adjoins it , and which also still exists . " The little log cabin where I was born , " existed in Zachariah 's childhood as a kind of outside kitchen ; it was certainly in such a capacity that Zachariah himself must have known it , no matter how he remembered it later in the more imaginative flights of political oratory by which he gave it fame . In his later years , William Joyner having now become a man of weight and standing in the community , his wife tried , as wives of successful citizens are apt to do , to ameliorate some of his social imperfections . The story goes that she tried to get him to wear shoes in summertime  --  for apparently he was a man who liked bare feet , and when he went out to the fields to work , the weather and the season permitting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formidable concession , the worthy woman then attempted to persuade him " at least to put your shoes on when you come into the house . " Her efforts even in thisp217direction were not successful , for although he made some effort to please her , he " kept forgittin ' . " Failing in all this , she finally tried to prevail on him " for pity 's sake , at least to put your shoes on when company comes . " But this also proved too much , for she used to say despairingly : " I do n't know what to do with him . I 've begged an ' I 've pled an ' he promises to try , but the minute we have company  --  even when the preacher 's there  --  here he comes without his shoes , trampin ' along out of the fields in his big feet . " As for " Bear " Joyner  --  for , after his famous encounter with the grizzly , he was known by this name  --  he would often say : " I thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I done was to go an ' git myself hitched to a blacksmith . My advice to you young'uns is , if you ever go and git yourself married , make sure first whether you 're marryin ' a woman who is goin ' to cook fer you , or one who is goin ' to try to throw you down an ' shoe you every time you come into the house . " He was a man of keen wit , and everyone who ever knew him said that he would have " gone far " if he had had the advantages of formal education . He was unable to read or write his own name until he was more than forty years old ; but he learned how to do both in his later years . Indeed , he developed quite a taste for reading , and , limited as his facilities were , he managed to acquire a surprising store of bookish information . Bear Joyner , like his famous son , was increate with myth , becausethe very nature of the man persuaded it . Such myths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bear-fighting , hunting , blacksmith-crushing , dog-mastering , and his instinctive shoeless  --  ness we have adduced to give the flavor of the man . These things get into the story , make the picture . Yet it is not the Myth that falsifies the true identity of man ( our debunkingp2I8 truth-tellers of the present notwithstanding  --  would to God they were themselves debunked ! ) The Myth is true . Let those who doubt it deny that Lincoln liked a joke , and had a gift for making one ; split rails ; was very strong ; said h  --  1 and d  --  n ; so far as we can guess , was not averse to  --  ; was pungent in his speech , and said his legs were long enough to reach the ground ( which certainly was high sense ) ; picked up the dirty pig ; was chased out of doors by his wife  --  yes , and even when embarrassed by the presence of surrounding ladies on a railroad platform , told a little boy who pointed to a certain word scrawled upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stood for was " a station , son ... the name , son , of a certain station . . . a most important station . . . the station where more men get on and off than any other station in the world . " A myth , then , to like food and women , and to take a drink ? ... A myth to know the use of corncobs in the country ? .. . To be able to say  --  , and make a joke about it ? . . . To be a lawyer , and have " a high and squeaky voice , " and yet be able to speak Gettysburg ? 0 , little men , come , come ! Then why the Myth ? The Myth is founded on extorted fact : wrenched from the context of ten thousand days , and rutted roads , the desolations of lost voices long ago , the rheumy nostrils in the month of March , the winter howling in the oak , the superfetation of the dreary wait , the vacancy of unremembered hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lack of it . It is a simplefact of seeing . Seeing , we are saved . Half-seeing , we are worse than blind . And wrong . It is important , then , to know that William Joyner " chawed the b'ar . " But it is even more important to know that William Joyner was a man who learned to read a book.  |p219It  may be that some later period in the human history will dispense with the whole necessity of print , and that book-reading , book-writing , book-publishing , all the ramified accessories that have accumulated since old Gutenberg , will ( through some system of psychophones , printos : . opes , empathic waves , or type telepathies ; or what more of the strange and unbelievable we can wot not of ) be as prehistoric as the dinosaur . But in William Joyner 's day the thing was known not only known , but , aside from speech , the swiftest and most common way of all communication ; and the point is that , illiterate as he was until his fortieth year , unread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own name in common script he learned it ! Why ? We do not know ; and can not guess the reason except that men sought India once , and braved inhuman seas beyond the world 's edge , in their scallop shells ; and looked at one another with " a wild surmise . " As for all other antecedents  --  possible Joyners in the Middle Ages , with the Roses , or King Charles  --  let others search them : all things must have their precincts , and our own are there , in Old Catawba , with Bear Joyner , in the hills of home . Whatever seed produced him , or what kernel of his own unknownheritage , the man was " there "  --  and not only " chawed the b'ar , " but learned to read a book . And of all the facts that can be evidenced , of all the traits that bind the clan of William Joyner 's seed together , none is more strange than its respect for learning . Where did it come from ? In the century since old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his name who have been dwellers in these hills . Some have been mountain folk , bowed down by poverty , who never learned to write , or to construe in print , their names . Others have been half-literate . Others have had the rudiments of education . Still others have risen in the world to places of commercial220 THE HILLS BEYONDp220eminence : some have been lawyers , doctors , business men ; there has been a preacher here and there ; there has been more , much more , than an average sprinkling of " radical thinkers "  --  " atheists and agnostics " ( that is to say , people who would openly debate the divinity of Jesus Christ , or the existence of " the after-life " ) ; others who had " radical notions " ( people who would challenge the accepted standards of law and property : there was one such who ran for Congress on the ticket of Eugene Debs , and got eight votes  --  it was said , however , that his sons and brothers did not vote for him ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reputation of being " queer . " The word is not used scornfully , for generally , no matter what their station , the Joyners are respected folk . But any variation from the norm in them does not astonish anyone : people have come to accept it casually and as a matter of expected fact . If a Joyner is an " atheist , " an " agnostic , " a " socialist , " a " radical , " it has come to be accepted because the Joyners are " queer " folk . But again  --  why ? Boiled down to their essential element , all of these " eccentric " qualities which have , for a hundred years or more , caused their neighbors to accept the Joyners as belonging to their special type , and " queer , " are nothing but the marks of an intensely heightened curiosity , a questioning , probing , debating , and examining intelligencethat their neighbors did not have . There 's the mystery  --  if mystery it be ; indeed , the only mystery there is . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all mountain folk . Yet other mountain folk are individualistic more convenably . Most mountain folk are individuals within the narrowframe of a convention . True , they will go their own way , make their own law , " take nothing off of any man "  --  but all of this follows a close code . They are clannish , suspicious of the strange , world-lost , mistrustful of the outer world  --  conformant ,  |p220really  , in their non-conforming . For even when they go their way and kill their man , they are unquestioning of the special law of their own world . In this respect the Joyners were all different from their neighbors , and the pattern of divergence was set by the founder of the clan . At a time when it was the convention for all men in the wilderness to be illiterate , in a place where the knowledge contained in books was of no earthly use , nothing would suit old Bear Joyner but that he must learn to read . At a later time , as has already been stated , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's distinction by tracing his line back to the Middle Ages . It was no use . The answer lay closer home . For no one ever really knew where his father came from . And it did not matter . Old Bear Joyner came from the same place , and was of the same kind , as all the other people in the mountains . But he was a man who learned to read . And there is the core of the whole mystery.  | IF , AS CARLYLE SAYS , THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD IS RECORDED IN the lives of its great men , so , too , the spirit of a people is recordedin the heroes it picks . No better illustration of this fact could be found than in the life of Zachariah Joyner . Historically , his position is secure enough . True , his greatest fame is where he would himself have wished it to be  --  at home . His name has not attained the national celebrity of a Webster or Calhoun ; no doubt most people outside Catawba would have difficulty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the affairs of his own state for almost fifty years ; as an able and resourcefulGovernor ; later , as one of the more forceful and colorful leaders of debate in the affairs of the United States Senate ; and all in all , when the whole record of his life is weighed and estimated , as a man of great natural ability and intelligence , considering his place and time and situation . He directed the affairs of his state through the Civil War , and he directed them courageously and ably . In periods of stress he was unmoved by threat and unswayed by the hysterias of popular feeling . In the closing days of the Confederacy , when the armies were in desperate need , he curtly refused a demand from Jefferson Davis for almost seventy thousand suits of uniforms , shoes , and coats which the state owned and had in its possession . He refused bluntly and without apology , saying that the equipment would bep223used first of all for the rehabilitation of his own people ; and althoughthis act of rebellion brought down upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision and refused to budge . Later , in the darker days of Reconstruction , military occupation , black legislatures , and night riders , he rendered even greater serviceto his state . And he concluded a long life , full of honors and accomplishment , as a member of the nation 's Senate , in which capacity he died , during Cleveland 's last administration , in 1893 . All these facts are sufficiently well known to make his position in the nation 's chronicle secure . But to people in Catawba his name means a great deal more than this . They are well acquainted with the story of his life , and the record of his offices as it has been outlined here . But these honors and accomplishments , splendid as they are , do not in themselves explain the place he holds in Catawba 's heart . For he is their hero : in the most local and particularsense , they feel that he belongs to them , is of them , could in no conceivable way belong to anything else , is theirs and theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only their own native Lincoln  --  their backwoods son who marched to glory by the log-rail route  --  he was their Crockett and Paul Bunyan rolled in one . He was not alone their hero ; he was their legend and their myth . He was , and has remained so to this day , a kind of living prophecy of all that they themselves might wish to be ; a native divinity , shaped out of their own clay , and breathing their own air ; a tongue that spoke the words , a voice that understood and spoke the language , they would have him speak . They tell a thousand stories about him today . What does it matterif many of the things which they describe never happened ? They are true because they are the kind of things he would have said , the kind of things that would have happened to him . Thus ,  | to what degree , and in what complex ways , he was created so in their imaginations , no one can say . How much the man shaped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much Zack Joyner created his own folk , or how much his people created him  --  no one can know , and it does not matter . For he was of them , and the rib ; and they of him the body and the flesh . He was indigenous to them as their own clay , as much a part of all their lives as the geography of their native earth , the climate of their special weather . No other place on earth but Old Catawba could have produced him . And the people know this : therefore , again , they love him . In examining the history of that great man , we have collected more than eight hundred stories , anecdotes , and jokes that are told of him , and of this number at least six hundred have the unmistakable ring  --  or smack  --  of truth . If they did not happen  --  they should have ! They belong to him : they fit him like an old shoe . " But , " the pedants cunningly inquire , " did they happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , they sound like him he might have said them  --  but that 's not the point ! Did he ? " Well , we are not wholly unprepared for these objections . Of the six hundred stories which have the smack of truth , we have actually verified three hundred as authentic beyond the shadow of a doubt , and are ready to cite them by the book  --  place , time , occasion , evidence  --  to anyone who may inquire . In these stories there is a strength , a humor , a coarseness , and a native originality that belonged to the man and marked his every utterance . They come straight out of his own earth . As a result of our researches , we can state unequivocally that there is no foundation in fact for the story that one time , in answerp225to a lady 's wish , he called out to a Negro urchin at a station curb , who had a donkey wagon and a load of peanuts : " Boy ! Back your over here and show this lady your ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Senate ( in rejoinder to the Honorable Barnaby Bulwinkle ) that is generally accredited to him , even though there is no account of it in the Congressional Record : " Mr. President , sir , we are asked by the honorable gentleman to appropriate two hundred thousand dollars of the taxpayer 's money for the purpose of building a bridge across Coon Creek in the honorable gentleman 's district  --  a stream , sir , which I have seen , and which , sir , I assure you , I could halfway across . " The Vice-President ( pounding with his gavel ) : " The Senator is out of order . " Senator Joyner : " Mr. President , sir , you are right . If I was in order , sir , I could the whole way across it ! " The last story that is told of Zachariah Joyner is that in his final days of illness ( and , like King Charles , in dying , he was " an unconscionable time " ) he was aroused from coma one afternoon by the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the window of his room , he saw the spare figure of his brother Rufus hastening toward the house . Even in his last extremity his humor did not forsake him , for he is said to have smiled wanly and feebly croaked : " My God ! I reckon it 's all up with me ! For here comes Risk I " People told the story later and , despite the grimness of the joke , they laughed at it ; for the family trait to which it pointed was well known . Bear Joyner , in his later years , after he had moved to Libya Hill , when told of the death of one of his sons in Zebulon by his second marriage , is known to have said : " Well , I reckon some of the childern will attend the funeral Here he considered seriously a moment , then nodded his head with an air of confirmation . " Hit 's  --  hit 's no more than right ! " And after another pause he added virtuously : " If I was thar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wagged his head quite solemnly , in such a way as to leave no doubt about the seriousness of his intent . Zachariah is reported , when asked the number of his kin , to have replied : " Hell , I do n't know ! You ca n't throw a rock in Zebulon without hitting one of them ! " He reflected on his metaphora moment , and then said : " However , let him that is without sin among you throw the first stone . I ca n't ! " And with these words he turned virtuously away , scratching himself vigorously in the behind . Again , when he responded to the greeting of a member of the audience after a political rally at which he had made a speech , he is reported to have said : " My friend , your face looks familiar to me . Have n't I seen you somewhere before ? " To which the person so addressed replied : " Yes , sir . I think you have . I was yore pappy 's ninth child by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his first . So I reckon you might say that you and me was both half-brothers , distantly removed . " The grimmest story in the whole Joyner catalogue , perhaps , is that old Bear Joyner , when reproached one time for a seeming neglect of his own brood , is reputed to have said to his inquisitor : " My God Almighty ! A man can plant the seed , but he cai n't make the weather ! I sowed ' em  --  now , goddamn ' em , let ' em grow ! " There is no reason to believe that either William or his childrenwere as neglectful of each other as these stories indicate , yet they really do denote a trait  --  or failing  --  of the clan . The fault  --  if fault it be  --  has long been known in Catawba , where it is saidp227that " the only thing that will bring ' em all together is a wedding or a funeral ; and it has to be a good one to do that . " And yet , this trait has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories as evidence that the Joyners were lacking in a sense of family feeling ; but nothing could be further from the truth . The truth is that no family ever lived that had a stronger sense of their identity . It is hard to describe the thing in more familiar terms , for the whole tribe violates the standards by which such things are commonly appraised . Of " affection , " " love , " " devotion , " even " clannishness "  --  as these terms are generally ac , cepted  --  the family seems to have had little . It is perfectly true that years have gone by when brothers have not seen or spoken to each other , even when they lived in the same town . It is also true that some have grown rich , indifferent to others who have struggled on in obscure poverty ; that children have been born , and grown up , and gone away , scarcely familiar with the look of a cousin 's face , the identity of a cousin 's name . Many people have observed these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as further proof that the tribe was " queer . " And yet , paradoxically , out of this very indifference came the family unity . From this very separateness came the deep and lasting sense of their identity . In a way , they reversed completely the old adage that if men refuse to hang together , they will all hang separately : of the Joyners it could rather be said that they hang separately because they know they hang together . To find what produced their sense of " separateness " one must look into the history of the family . The many children of Bear Joyner by his two marriages- , there were more than twenty by the lowest count  --  grew up in a community where every man had to look out for himself . As for old Bill himself , nothing in his earlier life had prepared him for the exacting duties of parenthood . Whatever his career had been before he came into the hill-bound fastnesses of Zebulon , it had been very hard . He is known to have said : " If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never will . A hen ' 11 scrabble for young chicks , but before they 're fryin ' size they 've got to scratch for themselves . " Although he was a man of substance for his time and place , his means were not enough to give two dozen children an easy start in life . Moreover , it must be owned that , like so many men who have been widowed in first marriage , he ventured into a second because it was the best expedient to meet his need . And the fourteenor sixteen children who came later  --  well , it is a brutal fact , but it was a sowing of blind seed . They came . They just came . And that was all . Perhaps it is unjust to emphasize the schism of this second marriage . And yet , a separation did exist . It is inevitable that this should have been . For one thing , the older children of Bear Joyner 's first marriage were fairly well grown when he married for the second time , and when the children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surviving children of the first  --  Zack , Robert , Hattie , Theodore , and Rufe  --  were , if not a different breed , yet of a separate clan . And they knew it . From the first , instinctively , they seemed to know it . It was not that , consciously , they felt themselves to be " superior "  --  a bitter accusation that was later made  --  and yet they seemed to feel they were . And  --  since the blunt truth must be spoken  --  in the light of their accomplishment , and in the world 's esteem , they were . Another fact the Joyners , first to last , were a vainglorious folk . Even old William had his share of this defect , perhaps even more than the rest of them , for old men thirty years ago who could remember him , and who would pay due tribute to his prowess and his extraordinary gifts , would often add : " Well , he knowed thatp229he was good . . . . He was remarkable , but he knowed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be bigoted ; and he was overbearing , too . . . . And as for Zack , " old men would smile when they said his name , " Well , there was Zack , too . He knowed that he was good . Zack was a wonder . . . but no one ever said he was a blushing violet . " The Joyners of this early flowering not only " knowed that they was good , " but they made little effort to conceal it . Apparently , none of them  --  unless it was Robert  --  hid his light under a bushel . And the truth is , each of them , in his own way  --  even Theodore !  --  had a light to show . The reasons ? Well , the reasons were complex , but perhaps the first one was the consciousness they had of special heritage . Bear Joyner 's first wife was a " special woman " : she was a Creasman , and the Creasmans were " good people . " The Joyners of the first lot were all proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to be told except that she was a good wife , a quiet and hard-working mother , and a Presbyterian . This last fact , trifling as it seems , was all important : for it bespeaks a kind of denominational snobbishness which is still more prevalent than the world may know , and which the Joyners of the first lot never lost . As to Bear Joyner 's second wife , she was a Baptist . The first Joyners  --  Zack , and all the rest of them  --  were always careful to speak of her respectfully , but with a touch of unconscious patronagethat was infuriating to " the country cousins " of the lesser breed : " Well now , she was a mighty good woman , and all of that . ... Of course "  --  with a kind of hesitant and regretful cones . siveness  --  " she was a Baptist . . . . I reckon you might call her a kind of religious fanatic .... She had queer religious notions . ... But she was a good woman .... She had some queer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children .... Now everyone will have to give her that ! " Here then , obviously , were the roots of the great schism . Bear Joyner himself seems to have shared unconsciously in this prejudiceof his elder children . He had apparently always been somewhat in awe of his first wife : her family was well known , and there is reason to believe he felt he was making a considerable step forward in the world when he married her . Toward his second wife he had no such feeling : she was one of a hard-shell Baptist tribe , and there is a story that he met her at camp meeting . Howeverthat may be , he was " looking for a woman to keep house " ; and it was pretty much in this capacity that he married her . That she worked long and faithfully there can be no doubt ; or that she was a patient , strong , enduring woman  --  " a good mother , " as the elder Joyners always willingly admitted , to the numerous family that she now began to bring into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his previous marriage  --  Zack , Hattie , Robert , Theodore , and Rufe ( Martha and George , the two remaining of the seven , had died in childhood )  --  they seem from the beginning to have been outside the sphere of their stepmother 's control . Their strongly marked individualities had already been defined and shaped by the time their father married again . They had inherited , in liberal measure , his own strong character , his arrogant confidence in his own powers , a good measure of his color , his independence , his intelligence , his coarse and swingeing humor , his quick wit . There is no evidence that they were consciously contemptuous of their new mother , but there is no doubt they felt superior to her . Even in a backwoods community theirs was a larger , bolder , more tolerant and experienced view of life than she had ever known ; and her narrow prejudice , her cramped vision , her rigidp231small moralities ( all products of an inheritance she could n't help ) simply amused them , aroused their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later years he always spoke feelingly of her excellent qualities , was particularly active in his humorous analysis of her . Her superstitions and prejudices amused him ; the operations of her mind , and the narrow cells of her morality seemed grotesque and ludicrous to him ; and he questioned , teased , examined her rather cruelly in order , as he said , " to see what made her tick . " Hers , indeed , poor woman , was a strange and contradictory code , and yet , because it was the only one she knew , she thought it was the only one there was : it seemed natural to her , and it never occurred to her to question it . That harsh code to which she adhered was indigenous to America . It has not only done much to shape our lives and histories , but it persists to this day , and is at the root of much of the sickness , the moral complex of America . For example , she believed it was wrong to take a life " in cold blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a drink . She was always warning her children against evil ways and loose living , and speaking of people who committed " all kinds of immorality and licentiousness " ; but it would have come strangely to her ears to hear murder referred to as an immoral act . True , it was " an awful crime "  --  she could understand it in these terms because the Bible told about Cain and Abel , and taught that it was wicked to take life . But , privately , she did not consider it half as bad for a man to take a life as to take a drink , or  --  what was the most immoral act of all  --  to sleep with a woman who was not his wife . Life-taking , the shedding of man 's blood , was so much a part of the life of a pioneer community that it occasioned no surprise . To be sure , she would not openly defend the practice of killing , although in a surprising number of individual cases she was willing to defend it , becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceptive gravity , would point out that her own brother  --  whose life in other ways she esteemed as a model of the Christian virtues  --  had been quite handy with his gun in his hot youth , and was known to have killed three men : " Now , Zack , " she would cry angrily , " do n't you go a-diggin ' into that . Reese had his faults , like everyone , and I reckon maybe in his young days he may have been hot-tempered . But he 's alwaysled a good Christian and God-fearin ' sort of life . He never drank or smoked or used bad language or ran around with women  --  like some people I know about . " Here she glared accusingly at her erring stepson , who returned her look with an expression of bland innocence . " So do n't you start on him : he 's always been an upright , moral sort of man . " All of this amused Zachariah no end : he did not mean to be cruel to her , but , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rummaging gravely about in the confusing rag-bag of her moral consciousness to see what further mysteries would be revealed . He is known to have spoken of the physical sharpness of her sense of smell , which really was amazing , and which all of her children inherited ( she is said one time to have " smelled burning leaves five miles away upon the mountain , long before anyone else knowed there was a fire " ) : " Well , she can smell fire and brimstone farther off than that . And Hell ! If I took a drink in Libya Hill , she 'd smell it on my breath before I crossed the county line ! " On another occasion , she is said to have called out to him the moment that he came into the house : " Zack Joyner ! You 've been drinkin ' that bad , old , rotten , vile corn licker again . I can smell it on your breath ! " " Now , mother , " he answered temperately , " there is no bad , old , rotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on in a tone ofp233judicious appraisal that she must have found very hard to take  --  " and some is better . But there is no bad ! " Again , when Bear Joyner returned from Libya Hill one day with this announcement : " Well , Thad Burton 's gone and done it again ! " " Gone and done what ? " said Zachariah , looking up . " Gone and killed a man , " Bear Joyner answered . " Oh ! " said Zachariah with a relieved air , casting a sly look toward his stepmother , " I was afraid you were goin ' to tell me he 'd done something really bad , like gettin ' drunk . " Bear Joyner was no less adept than his sons in this sport of teasing his bewildered wife . It is said that having driven in with her one day from Zebulon , to see the boys who at that time were " keeping store " for him in Libya Hill , he went into the store and , finding Zack on duty there , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys been leadin ' the Christ-life like your mother told you to ? " " Yes , sir , " Zachariah said . " Have you done your chores this mornin ' ? " " Yes , sir . " " Watered the milk ? " " Yes , sir . " " Sanded the sugar ? " " Yes , sir . " " Fixed the scales ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well , " said Bear , " you 'd better call in Ted and Bob . Your mother 's here , an ' we 're goin ' to have prayers . " Finally , there was the case of Harriet  --  the " Miss Hattie " of later years , for she never married  --  to add to the confusion and distress of William Joyner 's second wife . Of all Bear Joyner's children , Hattie was the favorite . In her , perhaps , more than in any of the others he saw the qualities  --  the quick wit , the humor , the independence and intelligence  --  that in himself he most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love child "  --  a euphemism maybe for the fact that she was illegitimate  --  and that this accounted for her father 's deeper care . At any rate , although her birth was hidden in an obscurity that was never cleared for old Bear Joyner never spoke of it , and no one dared to speak of it to him  --  she was brought up as a member of his elder brood . The story goes that he was gone one time for several weeks upon a journey to the south , and that when he returned he brought the child with him . She was almost eight years old then , and Martha , the first wife , was still alive . The story goes that Joyner brought the child into the house  --  the family was at dinner , and the faces of the other children wonderingly turned  --  and sat her down besidethem at the table . " This , " he said , " is your new sister . From this time on , she 'll be one of the family , and you 'll treat her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken . It is said that Martha , Joyner'sfirst wife , took the child as one of her own ; and in justice to the second wife , no matter what additional distress and confusionthis new proof of Joyner wickedness may have caused that bewildered woman 's soul , it was always freely acknowledged , most loyally of all by Harriet herself , as a further tribute to the woman 's qualities , that she was a good mother , and brought the girl up as if she were " one of her own . " Historically , time-periods are most curiously defined : the world does not grow up together . The footpads that made Johnson carry his stick at night when he went out alone in London in the Eighteenth Century have been quite actively abroad in recent years in our own land . And as for " human life , " a commodityp235which our editorial writers tell us they most jealously esteem , the security of human life in our own broad land  --  whether from murder , violence , or sudden death of every kind soever  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was in England at the period of Elizabeth , although our figures are by far the more bloody of the two . And as for our own Dick Whittingtons  --  our country boys who went to town  --  there , too , we ape the European pattern ; but we have been late . The history of human celebrity for the most part is an urban one . In our own land , although children are taught that most of their great men " came from the country , " it is not sufficiently emphasizedthat most of them also " went to town . " Certainly , this has been true in America : the national history could almost be written in the lives of men who went to town . Zachariah Joyner , in his later years , was very fond of using the log-cabin theme for politics , but if he had been more true to fact , he would have admitted that the turning point in his own career had come when he abandoned finally the world-lost fastnesses of Zebulon for the more urban settlement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , his threshold , the step from which he gained his vantage , took off for the larger community of public life and general notice in which for fifty years he was to play so large a role . And , in various ways , the same transitional experience was true of his more immediate family  --  his three brothers , who came with him . In one sense the whole history of the many Joyners , their divided lot and the boundary that separated the lowly from the great , might be stated in one phrase . It was the history of those who stayed at home , and of those who went to town . As the years passed , the division of each group became more widely marked , the sense of unity more faint and far . Hill- bound , world-lost , locked in the narrow valleys and the mountain walls of Zebulon , the Joyners who remained at home became almost as strange and far away to those who lived in Libya Hill as if their home had been the Mountains of the Moon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Bear Joyner had himself said so many years before , it was " the wrong way . " It really was this sense of two directions that divided them . The Libya Hill Joyners were facing ever toward the world , and those in Zebulon away from it ; and as years went by , it seemed that this directivenessbecame more marked than ever  --  the town Joyners ever more the world 's men ; those in Zebulon more withdrawn from the world . By 1900 , a whole century since William Joyner crossed the Blue Ridge and came down into the wilderness with his rifle and his grant of land , if some curious historian , gifted with immortality , could have returned there , he would have observed a change as startling as it was profound . He would have found the lives of the town Joyners ( for by this time Libya Hill had grown to twelve thousand people ) so greatly altered as to be scarcely recognizable ; but he would have found the lives of the country Joyners scarcely changed at all . True , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for the most part these were tragic ones . The great mountain slopes and forests of the section had been ruinously detimbered ; the farm-soil on hill sides had eroded and washed down ; high up , upon the hills , one saw the raw scars of old mica pits , the dump heaps of deserted mines . Some vast destructive " Suck " had been at work here ; and a visitor , had he returned after one hundred years , would have been compelled to note the ruin of the change . It was evident that a huge compulsive greed had been at work : the whole region had been sucked and gutted , milked dry , denuded of its rich primeval treasures : somethingp237blind and ruthless had been here , grasped , and gone . The blind scars on the hills , the denuded slopes , the empty mica pits were what was left . And true , the hills were left  --  with these deteriorations ; and all around , far-flung in their great barricades , the immense wild grandeur of the mountain wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long ago ; and which had held them from the world . And the old formations of the earth were left : the boiling clamor of the rocky streams , the cool slant darkness of the mountainhollows . Something wild , world-lost , and lyrical , and special to the place called Zebulon was somehow left : the sound of rockbrightwaters , birds calls , and something swift and fleeting in a wood ; the way light comes and goes ; cloud shadows passing on a hill ; the wind through the hill grasses , and the quality of light  --  something world-lost , far , and haunting ( special to the place as is the very climate of the soil ) in the quality of light ; and little shacks and cabins stuck to hill or hollow , sunken , tiny , in the gap ; the small , heart-piercing wisps of smoke that coiled into the clear immensity of weather from some mountain shack , with its poignant evidence that men fasten to a ledge , and draw their living from a patch of earth  --  because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be made to leave ; together with lost voices of one 's kinsmen long ago  --  all this was left , but their inheritance was bare . Something had come into the wilderness , and had left the barren land . And the people  --  ah , the people !  --  yes , the people ! They were left ! They were left " singing the same songs " ( as college Doctors of Philosophy so gloatingly assure us ) " their Elizabethan forebears sang "  --  which is a falsehood ; and no glory  --  they should have made new and better ones for themselves.  | " Speaking the same tongue " their Elizabethan forebears spoke  --  which also is a falsehood ; and they should have made a new one for themselves . " Living the same lives " their forebears lived a hundred years ago  --  which further is a falsehood . The lives their forebears lived were harsh and new , still seeking and explorative ; their own lives often were just squalid , which should have been better . What remained ? It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wrong . The earth had changed , the earth had eroded , the earth had washed down the gulleys in a billion runnels of red clay ; the earth was gone . But the people  --  ah , the people !  --  yes , the people ! The people were still there ! Turned backwards now , world-lost , in what was once new land ! Unseeking now , in what their forebears with blue vistas in their eyes , alone , in Indian country , sought !

And the Joyners  --  second Joyners ; the humble , world-lost Joyners out in Zebulon  --  they 're the people !  | BEAR JOYNER WAS WHAT WOULD BE CALLED TODAY " A forward-looking man . " He had not been settled down in Zebulon very long before he began to regret the choice that hadbrought him there , saying : " Hit 's too fer back ! Hit 's purty , but you ca n't git out ! " Here was the spirit of the empire-builder . He was not , in his own phrase , a man to " crawl into a hole and pull it in after him . " If there was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out "  --  and soon after he came to Zebulon he began to look for it . During the next twenty years his life was punctuated by his explorations , which , comparatively short though they were , were most significant . Throughout those two decades , restless , seeking , forever unsatisfied , he was still " looking for the place . " In this period of his early manhood he seems to have been regarded with misgivings by his neighbors in Zebulon , especially by the older and more conservative element . His good qualities  --  his energy , his skill , his strength , and his intelligence  --  were recognizedand esteemed , but there was a strong suspicion that he was by temperament a rolling stone , and that his worldly fortunes would never flourish because he would not stay at home long enough to allow them to take root . At first , his life was that of the woodsman and trapper . He fished , he hunted , and he had his little patch of land where hep241could grow such food as he needed . Wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even after his first marriage , this is the way he continued to live , in the cabin on the south fork of the Toe . But in those early years , as people told it later , he was forever " up and gone . " He would go off on long hunting trips , or on mysterious expeditions into the surrounding country . Sometimes these journeys took him into Tennessee , or down to South Carolina , or eastward across the Blue Ridge to the Piedmont , or even far north into Virginia . He would be gone for days , sometimes for weeks , " leavin ' that woman out thar all alone . " " There were forebodings and grave shakings of the head ; but while the others stayed at home , Bear Joyner saw new lands . People admitted freely that he " knew more about this country " than any other person living there . And his restless explorations were to bear fruit in unsuspected ways . Gradually he acquired a kind of gigantic mental blueprint of the whole region for a hundred miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creek , a valley , or a hollow in that vast wilderness which he did not know . Little by little , his knowledge began to define itself more clearly and to shape his moves , until at last it led him to Libya Hill . Libya Hill is a sort of great encampment in the hills , the tenting ground of the Blue Ridge . It is on a high plateau , close-held against the east , and again in semi-circles to the north and south , by a border of low hills , but opening to the west , and the soaring vistas of the western ranges forty miles away . The great ranges come down to the rolling slopes of Libya Hill like lions to a water-hole ; and westward , northward , southward , eastward , in smoky vistas the great ranges soar away . When Bear Joyncrp242first saw it he said , as Brigham Young was to say a little later of another spot : " This is the place . " It was , indeed , of all that mountain district of the west , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hills , the junction of the four directions of the map  --  the appointed , the inevitable , place . A river , broader than any of the small streams of Zebulon , wound through the passes of the hills into the West . Along the narrow valley of another winding stream another road was open to the East . Here was the place , not only where the world got out , but also where the world got in . Bear Joyner saw this ; and here at last , for him , was journey 's end . From this time on , the story of his life is the story of his withdrawings out of Zebulon toward this chosen place . In the end he took the four sons of his first marriage with him ; and he left the rest behind . The Joyners at last had come to town . Thence dates the final schism of the clan , as well as the beginning of its greater history . By 1828 Bear Joyner owned the country store in Libya Hill  --  the largest one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the years that followed , before the end of his long life , he bought up various tracts of land , and these were ultimately dispersed among the " four town Joyners " who became his heirs . Indeed , as recently as sixty years ago , when Libya Hill had grown to perhaps two thousand people , the Joyner heirs still held large tracts of land . And even in this present century children were familiar with the regretful recollections of their elders , who could recall when " Rufus Joyner offered me that whole block  --  from where the Palais Royal now stands all the way down to the Post Office corner  --  for two hundred dollars ! And I was such a fool I did n't take it ! If I had , I 'd have been a rich man today . You could n't buy it now for a million dollars ! But then  --  why , I just laughed at him . It was nothing but an old field , with a pigp243pen in the hollow , and the hogs used to wallow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars for that hole ? I thought Rufe Joyner must be crazy ; or else he took me for a fool . All right , ' he said . You wait and see . ' Well , I waited , and I did ! " By the time the Civil War broke out the Joyners were accountedwealthy folk . It was " the big family " of the whole community . Even long before that their position was so generally acknowledged throughout the western mountains that when the boys began to " make their mark , " it occasioned no surprise . When Zack Joyner was Governor of the state , and later United States Senator , he was fond of saying , for purposes political , that he had been " raised on hawg and hominy . " " I have known what it was , " he would say , warming up to his subject , and dropping into the mountain idiom for the benefit of his delighted followers  --  " I 've known what it was , boys , to go to bed on bacon and awake on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to go to bed and to git up without either of ' em . I have clumb the persimmon tree many 's the time to shrink my belly up to fit my rations , so do n't talk to me of no hard times . I can go right out into the cornfield or the tobacco patch today and spit on my hands and keep up with any man that 's settin ' here tonight . If I was twenty years younger , I 'd give ye all a head start and beat ye . " Like so many other specimens of political autobiography , this was a good deal less than accurate . Far from being the barefoot and half-starved infant born in a humble cabin  --  the image whirl- he was fondest of evoking  --  Zack had been brought up under circumstances which were amazingly comfortable for the time and place . Before he was half grown , his father was already con sidered well off and was one of the leading citizens of the town . Zack 's public statements about himself were simply part a ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create him  --  the legend of the backwoods savior , the country Moses , schooled by poverty , hardship , solitude , and the precepts of a stern and homely virtue , until at last he had been ready to come out of the wilderness and lead his people into the promised land . In elaboration of the log-cabin theme , Zack would say that " all the schoolin ' I ever had would not amount to three months put together , and even then I had to walk six miles for what I got . " This , too , was part of the myth on which great Zachariah 's life was founded . Privately , he would confess that he knew how to " read and write and cipher " before he came to Libya Hill . And there is proof that he , along with Theodore and Robert , attended school in Libya Hill for some time under the tutelage of a pedagogue who was always referred to later by the Joyners with considerable respect as " Old Professor Coleman . " Zack managed to learn , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his old age he could quote from Caesar 's Gallic Wars . In talking with his closer friends , he would admit something of the truth and say good-naturedly : " Well , it was n't a great deal , but it was something . Bob , Ted , and I learned how to read and write and cipher . And Uriah ! "  --  this was his familiar name for Rufus when his older brother was not present ( an indication that he knew his Dickens , too )  --  " Uriah , " chuckled Zack , " he never took the time to read or write , but , by God ! "  --  here his shoulders would begin to heave  --  " Uriah always did know how to cipher ! " Rufus , the oldest of the four , was , by general consent and his own choice , the storekeeper of the crowd . Of his career , all that need be set forth here are the bare facts . And the bare facts in Rufe 's case are peculiarly appropriate , for his was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady , quiet life which from first to last , with one exception , was to run on a single track . Thep245great exception , of course , was the Civil War . When the call came he went to war , he lived through the war , he came back from the war , and that was the only interruption that his purpose suffered . And his purpose was business . His purpose was money . That was all he ever did or thought about . He never married . He carried on his father 's business , he built it into a really great enterprise , and he became a rich man . Of any man , perhaps all that can be truly said when his life is done is that " he lived , he suffered , and he died . " With the same succinct finality it would later be said of Rufus : " He made money , and he died . " Meanwhile he lived in his father 's old house on College Street . Eventually his lusty , gusty , old-maid sister , Hattie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all the wit and savor , the irrepressible spirits and joy of living that animated the sprightly figure of Miss Hattie Joyner could ever deflect Rufus from his grim purpose . Even in his youth his stinginess was proverbial , and in his old age his brother , Zachariah , then also hale and sere , had no hesitation in proclaiming it : " Why , he 's so mean , " Zack roared , " he would n't down a preacher 's throat if his guts were on fire ! If you fell down and broke your leg he would n't come across the street to help you because of the shoe leather he 'd use up . He stops the clocks at night to keep the cogs from wearing out , and when he goes to church he puts a two-cent stamp in the collection plate and takes back a penny 's change ! " Hattie , who was more like Zachariah in her ribald humorany of the others , and who outlived all of them , would cackle gleefully and say : " Just wait till that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if I have to live to be a hundred . When he 's gone I 'm goin ' to open up the purse strings and let the moths fly ow ! I tell you , I 'm just waitin ' till he dies to cut loose and row Aril f "  | In the course of this chronicle we have mentioned the fact that old Bear Joyner had some fourteen or sixteen children by his second wife , all of whom were left behind in Zebulon when their father came to Libya Hill . He did not exactly leave them , for he was always going back for visits  --  the point is that he did not bring them with him , and they did not have gumption enough to insist on coming . We have not yet had occasion to tell about these members of the lesser breed , although they all had Christian names like other folk . Of those who survived the rigors of infancy and childhood there were , among the girls , Betsy , Alice , Melissa , and Florabelle , and , among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sid , and Rance . Insofar as they get into our story , each of these shall have his due in time . For the present they will have to look after themselves . We have left them behind in the fastnesses of Zebulon County where they made their bed , and there they will have to lie in it . They would not come along with us . They did not have it in them to push on with the Joyners of the great will , the great spirit , the great determination . Therefore we shall now leave them to the honorable but mute oblivion of unrecorded history , and shall forget about them until the turn of events compels us to seek them out again . Suffice it to say that they grew up and married and had children and grandchildren . They tilled the soil , they grew much corn and tobacco , they timbered the rugged slopes of Zebulon for Smike , the lumber thief , and mined for feldspar and for mica in the wretched pay of Gripe , Smike 's brother , until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and barren . They despoiled the land , and were in turn themselvesdespoiled . But still they were very worthy and honest people . There were few horse thieves among them , and only two or three of them got hanged . Just the same , it must be owned that they were small potatoes . They did not join the Joyners ofP247the greater breed . They never went to town  --  none of them , that is , except for Lafayette , and he came late , and the reasons for his coming were of quite another order from those which had moved his half-brothers years before . But of that , more anon . To everything its season , and our story now concerns the Joyners of the first coming . To be sure , it was not very much of a town that these first Joyners came to  --  unless " a hole in the road , " a log courthouse of one room , a log church , a general store , a hitching post , and a ramshackle tavern for itinerant drovers could be called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  town in the core , in the making , in the process of becoming . Libya Hill was at that time the only semblance of a town that the whole mountain district could boast of . When Bear Joyner became the owner of the general store and his fortunes began to flourish , he gave to his four favorite sons the education that each was fitted for . While Rufus settled down to keeping store like one who had been born for it , Zachariah , Robert , and Theodore were sent away , in turn , to college . At just what time in Zachariah 's formative years the idea of the law as a career first came to him , it is impossible to say ; but it came early , and the choice was inevitable . As a boy of eighteen , when he was helping Rufe to " tend store " for their father , he was already noted for his ready wit , his coarse humor , and his gift of repartee . People would come into the store " just to hear Zack Joyner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pretty shrewd appraisal of him from the first . Already people suspected , or observed , more than a trace of charlatanism in his make-up . It was said : " He can talk you out or talk you in to anything . "  | Among other tendencies that many noticed in him was a certain indisposition to hard work . Bear Joyner himself was well aware of this , because he said : " Well , I do n't know what to do with him unless I make a lawyer of him . He wo n't work  --  that 's certain . " Here he paused a moment ; then he grinned and added : " But he wo n't starve , neither . Not Zack . " It may be that there is wisdom in the observation of the showmanthat " the people like to be fooled . " Anyhow , the experience of Zack Joyner 's life would seem to bear this out . For the very basis of his amazing political success lay in the people 's awareness of him : not only the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was so much of them , as if they felt him to be , in some special way , their own . And among the qualities which people seemed most to admire in Zack , and to be proud of rather than otherwise , was his tincture of charlatanism and smooth dealing . They loved to tell stories to illustrate Zack 's smartness , his adeptness , his superior adroitness and cunning , and men would wag their heads and laugh with envious approval , as though they wished they could do such things themselves , but knew , being merely average men , that they could not make the grade . So Zack was sent away for a year of legal training at Pine Rock College ( a year was considered ample in those days ) . Bob followed him there and also had his year of training for the law . Then both boys returned home again , were admitted to the bar , and hung out their shingle as the firm of Joyner and Joyner . By 184o they were enjoying a thriving practice . For in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-fledged lawyers  --  this very same Zack and Bob whom everybody in town had known and liked and watched grow up  --  was quite a thing to marvel at and feel a sense of personal pride in . Lawyers , of course  --  that articulate tribe which was to breed and multiply with such astonishing proliferation during the nextP249century  --  were not utterly foreign to the little town . From its beginnings Libya Hill had been the county seat , and had had its courthouse , its circuit judges , and its trials for thirty years or more . But the Joyners were the first lawyers to come of local stock . The others heretofore had been imported . These other lawyers had come in to the sessions of the court from older and more populous communities beyond the Blue Ridge  --  from Old Stockade , from Millerton , from Locust Gap  --  and occasionally from still larger towns farther east , down in the Piedmont . They had come in by stage , by coach , by horse and saddle . They had cc me in with their frocktails parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spindly legs hung loosely down around the shining flanks . They had come in with their jaws lank and learned , their thin lips closed , their cold eyes ruminant and speculative , narrowed into slits , their saddlebags stuffed with all the cunning of their accursed and incessant papers . They had come in and dismounted and tied up at the hitching post before the log courthouse , had swung their bony hands beneath their coattails and carried in the saddlebags and unpacked their papers , and then had spoke strange words  --  strange words of depth and learning no one else could understand . While all the helpless natives looked on and gaped their wonderment , the great men cleared their throats and uttered strange and mystic words and shuffled their accursed papers in their parchment fingers . And , so speaking and so doing , they had then departed , leaving native awe behind them , taking with them native fees . Now this was changed . The Joyner boys had gone away beyond the Blue Ridge , farther off than anyone else had ever been , had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning  --  deep learning , lawyer learning  --  and now could speak and write the mystic words that no one else could read , that no one but the joyners or another lawyer could even make out the sense of . Zack and Bob , as everybody owned , were smart had always been  --  and now that they had learned nearly everything there was to know , they had come back to town and could hold their own with any other of the lawyer crew  --  in fact , could say words as big and deep and dark as any other lawyer in the world . And people marveled that the Joyners were their very own . They themselves had produced the Joyners . Accordingly they felt , not only the humility of awe , but the pride of ownership and the ecstasy of submission . Everyone had the satisfaction of knowing that hereafter if he was going to be eaten by a shark , it would be one of his own choosing that had grown in native waters . Zack and Bob , therefore , were now in clover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging , but of being in at the beginning . Before very long they were enjoying what was practically a monopoly of their chosen profession and were doing most of the legal work of the entire mountain region . It was a curious paradox , though , that these two brothers , sprung from the same seed , brought up in exactly the same way , educated to the same degree as far as formal training went , and set upon the parallel courses of their lives at precisely the same point , were to have such widely divergent careers . From the first , their natures inclined them to seek different objectives . It was the primary fact of Robert 's nature , once he became interested in the law , to study it profoundly , to pierce beyond the letter to the spirit of the thing , and to see it as an adaptive instrument of the common good . Once he had made up his mind to be a lawyer , he concentrated all his fine qualities of character and intellect upon the single goal of making himself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From that point on , it r ' ever entered his head to want to be anything else.  |p251Zack  , however , was never seriously interested in the law . Oh , he wanted to be a lawyer right enough , and as a trial lawyer he became one of the best , with a courtroom manner that could sweep a jury completely off its feet even when the weight of evidence was against him . Yes , he wanted to be a lawyer , but he wanted it not because he loved the law , but because he loved something else a great deal more and saw in the law the surest means of getting it . And what Zack really wanted more than anything in life was to be a politician . That was the role he had been born for . All his talents fitted him for it as for nothing else . The law , therefore , was just a stepping stone for Zack , and a very handy one it proved to be . In the general estimation , even back in the days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected , the most trusted ; but Zachariah was by all odds the most popular , the most loved . And already Zack 's feet were firmly planted on the rungs of the political ladder . It did not hurt his chances of success for people to say , as they were now saying : " The man that beats Zack Joyner 'll have to git up early and stay up late . " He was , throughout his life , the hero of the crowd . Robert , on the other hand , never played up to an audience . Quiet , blunt , plain-spoken whenever there was need for plain speaking , he was first and last a forthright and an honest man . His purposes he kept forever single , and already those few who knew him well were predicting for him a useful , and indeed a noble , career . How useful and how noble , not even they could have foretold , but it was written in the stars that such a man as Robert , in a profession which is so frequently besmirched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself upon the bench . And so , in time , he did , as we shall see . Meanwhile both brothers married , and chose their mates well . Robert married rather late in life and had an only son , who in/herited both his father 's character and the delicate sensitivity of his mother . Zachariah , despite a robust predilection for pretty women , married young , and he surprised some people by remain , ing constant to his wife until the end of her days . He became the devoted father of three lovely daughters , and of a son in whom he took great pride . The difference between these two brothers became more and more marked with the passage of time . And strange to say , it never brought them into conflict . Their talents were complementary , and each man respected the other for what he was . For Zack , in spite of the deliberate charlatanism of speech and manner which so endeared him to the people , had a solid inner core of sincerity which even such a completely upright man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfill his destiny , but in their later years , even after Zachariah had risen to the place of highest eminence in the state , people would still say : " Zack Joyner will promise you the moon , and you 'll be lucky if you get green cheese . Bob Joyner wo n't even promise cheese ; but you 're likely to get something in the end . " Often those communities which are most ruthless in their violation of the law are also the most devout in their respect for it . Of no section has this been truer than of the South . Almost from the beginning , among rich and poor alike , the profession of the law has been esteemed above all others . With people of the wealthier class , it represented the most approved and honorablealternative to the other career of plantation agriculture ; and , of course , an incomparable advance over the almost ignominious last resort of trade . To the sons of poorer people , the hardy productsof small tenantry and the descendants of the mountain white , it represented an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For , to such people as Zack Joyner , to such people asP 253the more able , fortunate , and intelligent children of old Bear , the law represented almost the only possible means of escape from an environment and from a life that could promise nothing more than the narrow world of backwoods isolation , and the reward of a bare living , hardly gained . In this way , it came to be accepted almost without question among mountain folk that the most gifted of their sons would , if possible , get into the profession of the law . The lawyer was a kind of medicine man to the community . To his ruder , simpler , and less talented contemporaries , he was the man of learning and of argument , the man of reason and of fluent speech . He was the man to wear good clothes , to have white hands , to live in a good house , and to be vested with the honors and rewards of high authority by his less fortunate fellows , because his talents and accomplishments entitled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil that has become widespread , rooted in the very structure of the nation 's life is instantly apparent . It offered to many unscrupulous men , under the protectionsof a high authority , the opportunity to prey upon their neighbors  --  neighbors who were not endowed with their own shrewdness , smoothness , gift of gab , and formal training , and who , by the conditions of the system , were forced to seek recourse for their troubles from the very men who preyed on them . Not that the lawyers themselves were inevitably and invariably dishonestmen . But the system put a high premium on dishonesty , and those lawyers who had integrity enough to resist the everpresenttemptation to prey upon their neighbors were , at best , left in the unhappy position of being themselves a part of one of the basic functions of society that had been tainted at its source . It was very unfortunate that from the beginnings of American life the profession of the law was commonly considered , not ao much an end in itself , as a means to an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means was , in the final analysis , almost identical with the end of business  --  namely , personal advantageand private profit . With business , it did not matter so much , because , until recently , no one had ever supposed that business had a social purpose as well as a private one ; and this was why , through all human history , business and trade had been looked down upon , and the business man condemned by lofty minds as the stinking , swinking fellow that he usually was . But the law , in theory at least , was supposed to be different from this . It represented one of the most elemental of social functions , and if private profit entered into its operations , this was supposed to be only incidental , in order that lawyers might eat . Actually , matters worked out quite otherwise in practice . Too often the end to which the law supplied the means was private profit , and the avenue by which one arrived at that end was politics , party conflict , candidacy , and election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in his own community , this process was considered so right and so inevitable that any variationfrom it seemed extraordinary . A lawyer who did not also " get into politics , " or at least show a partisan and active interest in it , was a queer fish . So when Robert Joyner decided to stick to the law and refused to have any truck or traffic with politicians , people began to wonder about it ; and when they could find no satisfactory explanation of his extraordinary conduct , they shook their heads and said he was a fine man , of course , but a little queer . There was nothing queer about Zack . When he began to get into politics he was doing exactly what everyone naturally expected him to do . People not only understood , they enthusiasticallyapproved , and showed their approval by voting for him the first chance they got . The course which Zack followed was the accepted procedure throughout the greater part of the nation . It is still the standardp255procedure . And the social implications of this fact are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , there seems to have been a general assumption among the majority of the populationthat the functions of the law and of justice were divergent , and perhaps quite incompatible and hostile to each other . This accounted for the grotesque paradox that in such communities as that from which Zachariah Joyner came , where lawlessness , personalviolence , and the taking of human life flourished in their most extreme and savage forms , respect for " the law " was curiously deep-seated and profound . People in such communities felt instinctively that justice was a personal matter , and that the ends of justice could only be individually secured ; but that the law was a political and public matter , and that its purposes and concerns had better be left as far as possible to the unpredictable operation of its mysterious machinery . Thus a man would kill another man to get justice for himself ; but he would go to court to keep from being hanged for it . Anyone who has ever attended a murder trial in a mountain community  --  such a trial as Zack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as counsel for prosecution or defense ; such a trial , indeed , as is still being enacted in Zebulon today  --  must have observed the astonishing illustration of this paradox . A man has killed another man , with whom there has been " bad blood " for years ; and now he is on trial for his life , and the entire community has come to witness and take part . On one side , at a rude table , are seated the attorneys for the state , and the private counsel which the family of the murdered man has employed to help the state in prosecuting of its case . On the other side , at another similar table , are marshaled the battery of attorneys which the family of the accused man has engaged to defend him , and to secure , if possible , a verdict of acquittal . Behind these two batteries of embattled legal talent , separated from them only by a low wooden barrier , upon the front rows of battered seats , are clustered the many witnesses whom both the prosecution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the wives , friends , brothers , children , relatives , and neighbors who have some evidence to contribute . And behind them , crowding the rows of battered seats , packed in the dusty aisles , pressed into the rear four-deep , jammed so thick and dense that they are not able to move in the suffocating atmosphereof mid-July , is as much of the blue-shined , faded-overailed , and gingham-bonneted community as the dingy whitewashedroom will hold . In the center , upon a small raised platform , the presiding judge sits at his desk  --  sometimes a table . To his left is the witness box and the clerk of the court . To his right , the court stenogra pher . Behind him , tacked to the whitewashed wall , are the Stars and Stripes . And to his left again , upon two rows of chairs , are the twelve men selected for a jury after a three days ' inquisition by the contending forces of attorneys : selected from a whole army of veniremen , one hundred in all , such men as these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from another county , because everyone in Zebulon , in one fashion or another , is related . In some distant way , even the murdered man is a cousin of the man who sits here now accused of killing him . And the feeling is too high , the passions too fierce  --  the skein . of prejudice , family loyalties , and clannishness ; the dense web of more than a hundred years of intermarrying , of conflicts gone but not forgotten , of feuds long past but never dead  --  it is all too complex and too dangerous to find here a jury that could pass impartial judgment . The whole thing is as deadly and as thrilling in the naked impact of its social forces as anything on earth can be . The air is electric with its tension ; one feels that if a match were struck , p 257the whole place might explode . For everything is here  --  not only the whole present life of the community , packed , tense , and crowded , stripped down at length to the naked trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is here : his own life , and the life of all his neighbors , the lives of his fathers and his kinsmenand of all who have gone before him . And with it all , at the very peak and crest of this desperate and final hour , one feels upon all sides , from both groups , among all parties and all partisans , a curious impassivity . Passion leashed there is , the unforgiving will to kill , and kill again , to get full measure of reprisal  --  an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , a brother for a brother , and a friend for a friend  --  and yet , with it all , a curious , fatal , deadly impassivity of judgment . For passion belongs to justice , passion shall come later on  --  and there shall be again a time for justice and vengeance and for blood of murdered men . But now it is a question of " the law . " The law has spoken , the law must have now its full day in court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and according to the schedule of its own particular machinery . And these people , every woman , man , and child of them , in this way , in this astounding way , understand , respect , and make a separate place in their own judgment for the law and for its judgments . And in such ways as these , no other folk on earth so deeply understand the law ; for , in such ways as these , it has been rooted in their lives , as much a part of them as the very air they breathe , the very speech they speak  --  yes ! the very justice that they take upon themselves and execute , the very vengeance that they so secure . The trial begins , in such a scene as this  --  a scene that has not changed an atom since the days when Zachariah Joyner knew it , and took his part in it  --  a scene which , with all its strange and terrible contradictions , is somehow as memorable and as moving as it is thrilling ; for in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tormented life  --  the huge complex of America , with all its innocence and guilt , its justice and its cruelty , its lawlessness and its law . There at his table sits the judge , a white-haired man , with his string necktie , his boiled shirt , his dark clothes  --  the quiet vestmentsof his high authority . Blood of their blood , bone of their bone , kin of their kin  --  the whole story of their thousand feuds , the knowledge of all their passions and their guilts , together with the very names of each of them , are as familiar to him as the names of his own sons . And he sits in judgment there above the raging furnace of that packed and very quiet hell  --  not only ' a man of their own people , but , as the trial proceeds , a man of wisdom and of courage , a splendid and impartial embodiment of law . Here , too , the years have not changed man for this judge is the same kind of man as Robert Joyner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty years ago . And now the charge is read , the fatal question asked and answered . From the left side of the court , the state rises , and the trial begins . The state 's witnesses are called forward . Uneasy , awkward , they shuffle in around the wooden rail  --  a snag-toothed mountain woman , with a harelip and a bewildered look ; a stupid shag haired fellow with a blunted face ; another , small , compact , contained , soft-voiced , with furtive eyes ; another , with an uneasy look of divided loyalties ; another , grim , determined-looking ; some others of this kind ; then the murdered man 's pregnant wife , large , oily-eyed , and swollen featured  --  they are all sworn in together , with their right hands dividing three battered books . The first is called into the box ; the state Solicitor arises , and the trial is on . " Where were you on the night of May 14 , a little before eight o'clock ? " The very words and phrases since Zack Joyner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even the Solicitor has changed . This was Zack Joyner 's job before him : it 's how they begin . The Solicitor is a young man now , in his mid-thirties , wellmade , of something more than middle height  --  five feet eleven , we should guess  --  one hundred and eighty pounds of him , abundant , curly hair , by nature crisp , tinged reddish brown . It is a strong face , too , the angles well-defined , high-boned ; the jaw strong , competent , jutting out a little ; the long lip touched with humor and belligerency  --  the whole Scotch-Irish , long upper lip more Irish than Scotch . He is already schooled in the manner of the country lawyer , the country politician , still bearing with him traces of high school debate , and subsequent experiments in commencement oratory . He is already able to refer to " the little log cabin where I was born "  --  or , in somewhat more modern phrase , to " the farm where I grew up . " He 's out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The talk of justice does n't enter in . A murder has been done  --  he knows that , so does the other side , and so does everyone . There 's no debate in that ; it is agreed . The only question now is : " How much ? " The first degree is " out . " No one wastes time in talking of the first degree in Zebulon . There has n't been a conviction in the first degree in Zebulon since before the Civil War . Zack Joyner got that one when he was Solicitor ; and it was for rape . There 's no first degree for murder out in Zebulon  --  the only question is : " How much ? " The Solicitor admits he has " a strong side " against him . The murderer is prominent , his family are " big people " in the county ; his father back before him killed his man in youth , and his father was a highly respected citizen . The family has stood high , has great connections ; to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the best murder lawyers that the western districts can provide  --  the killer 's uncle , old man Martin , a good lawyer and a Baptist and a pillar of the church  --  he " knows the law " ; Zeb Pendergraft , the best defense lawyer in the county ; Whit Gardiner of Millerton ; and several others . But the long lip , and the smile , good-humored but belligerent , show the Solicitor 's belief that he has a chance . It 's going to be a hard fight , but he believes he has a chance to get a conviction in the second degree  --  from twelve to twenty years  --  and if he does , another feather in his cap . Twelve years for murder out in Zebulon , added to a mounting record . The pattern of his plan is set : a little later on he 'll try the legislature ; and after that , we 'll see . It has n't changed a bit . The man could be Zack Joyner 's twin . Even the degrees and stages , the necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . And now , the question asked  --  and from the other side , like an electric flash , the crackle of " Objection ! " up and down the line . The leading forward of the witness step by step , the turning over of the witness to the thirsty jackals of the other side . Eyes turn : there is Zeb Pendergraft rocking back and forth in tilted chair , the red eyes and the alcoholic face inflamed and ready now . He tilts back and through his widened knees spits through discoloredteeth a dribble of tobacco juice , rocks forward again and comes to rest , and , suddenly , the inflamed face thrust forward , the voice harsh and rasping as a saw , the bully of the murder courts is at his work  --  the work for which he gets his pay  --  the work for which he is invariably employed  --  the work that is his noted specialty . " You know  --  " compacted equally of tearing rasp and overbearingsneer  --  " You know why you were there ! Tell this court why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! .. . p 261Is n't it true that you were there in jail yourself because you 'd been arrested for being drunk ? . . . You would n't say that ? .. .

" Objection sustained ! " Or " Objection overruled ! " . . . The duel crackles back and forth like flashes of artillery , the Solicitor tenacious , truculent , half-grinning ; Pendergraft , a series of explosive flashes , a snarling rasp of scalding words , the inflamed cockerel of the out-thrust head , broken by deliberate tiltings back at interrupted intervals to shift his quid and spit deliberately downwards , between widened knees , his dribble of tobacco juice . . . while the currents of excitement , whispers , and taut interest , broken by the judge 's warning gavel , flash through the crowd  --  and while the poor dumb creature , with stunned face and matted hair , squirms helplessly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ; the duel flashes back and forth  --  the Solicitor now alert to save the testimony of his challenged witness : " Yes , and tell the court . . . tell the court just why you were on the chain gang all those times . " And at last , the poor tormented witling has his day :  | " Fer gittin ' drunk  --  " and quickly , with an out-jerked thumb toward Pendergraft  --  " just like he does all the time . " Then , instant and explosive , an approving roar , a guffaw of applause , hand-clapping , and the shout of sympathetic laughter from that overalled , blue-shirted crowd , as if the heart of simple and tormented man has found support  --  the warmth of its own kind against the thrusts and shrewd outwittings of the law . But the old judge is on his feet now , his gavel pounding on the table , his face red beneath his silver shock , with righteous wrath : " If that occurs again , I 'll clear the court ! . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd arrest you all for contempt of court . . . . Mr. Sheriff , I shall hold you responsible for any further outbreak or disturbance ! . . . I order you to arrest anyoneyou see guilty of such disturbance , and if you have not enough men , I empower you to appoint deputies ! " Sternly , more quietly , after a moment 's pause , almost like a schoolmaster speaking to a classroom of unruly boys : " This is a court of law , and a man is on trial here for his life today ! . . . This is a solemn occasion . . . . It is disgraceful that any of you should come here to treat it as if it were a circus ! " The court room is as silent as a tomb now : those overalled and blue-shirted men almost seem to hold their breath as the old man with the white hair looks at them . In a moment , when he sees that they are properly chastened and subdued , he resumes his seat , adjusts his spectacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may proceed with your examination . " It is all the same  --  the same great and thrilling drama of violence , crime , and human passion ; the same drama of the human community , the great spectacle of " the law , " in the process of its orderly enfoldment  --  the rapier duel of embattled wits , the roughand-readyschool of quick rejoinder , the school of hammer-and/tongs debate , fighting it out on the dusty floor of a country court room , in the rough and tumble of a battle for a man 's life and liberty  --  while the whole concerted life of the community looks on . It is the same today as it was in Zachariah Joyner 's time . And this is the way he began , the school that taught him.  | dore loved a uniform a good deal better than he wore one ; and that he , as Master , with the help of the single instructor who completed the school 's faculty , undertook the work of military training , drill , and discipline with an easy confidence which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unjust . " I have heard , " Zachariah would say in later years , warming up to his subject and assuming the ponderously solemn air that always filled his circle of cronies with delighted anticipation of what was to come  --  " I have heard that fools rush in where angels fear to tread , but in the case of my brother Theodore , it would be more accurate to say that he leaps in where God Almighty crawls ! . . . I have seen a good many remarkable examples of military chaos , " he continued , " particularly at the outset of the war , when they were trying to teach farm hands and mountain boys the rudiments of the soldier 's art in two weeks ' time . But I have never seen anything so remarkable as the spectacle of Theodore , assisted by a knock-kneed fellow with the itch , tripping over his sword and falling on his belly every time he tried to instruct twenty-seven pimply boys in the intricacies of squads right . " That was unfair . Not all , assuredly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Theodore , " Zack went on with the extravagance that characterizedthese lapses into humorous loquacity  --  " Theodore was so short that every time he he blew dust in his eyes ; and the knock-kneed fellow with the itch was so tall that he had to lay down on his belly to let the moon go by . And somehow they had got their uniforms mixed up , so that Theodore had the one that was meant for the knock-kneed tall fellow , and the knockkneedtall fellow had on Theodore 's . The trousers Theodore was wearing were so baggy at the knees they looked as if a nest of kangaroos had spent the last six months in them , and the knock/kneed fellow 's pants were stretched so tight that he looked like a couple of long sausages . In addition to all this , Theodore had a head shaped like a balloon  --  and about the size of one . The knockkneedfellow had a peanut for a head . And whoever had mixed up their uniforms had also got their hats exchanged . So every time Theodore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat he was wearing would pop right off his head into the air , as if it had been shot out of a gun . And when the knock-kneed fellow would repeat the order , the big hat he had on would fall down over his ears and eyes as if someone had thrown a bushel basket over his head , and he would come clawing his way out of it with a bewildered expression on his face , as if to say , Where the hell am I , anyway ? ' . . . They had a devil of a time getting those twenty-seven pimply boys straightened up as straight as they could get  --  which is to say , about as straight as a row of crooked radishes . Then , when they were all lined up at attention , ready to go , the knock-kneed fellow would be taken with the itch . He 'd shudder up and down , and all over , as if someone had dropped a cold worm down his back ; he 'd twitch and wiggle , and suddenly he 'd begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zachariah 's part were famous . Once launched , his inventive power was enormous . Every fresh extravagance would suggest half a dozen new ones . He was not cruel , but his treatment of his brother bordered on brutality . The truth of the matter is that the " pimply boys " drilled so hard and earnestly that the grass was beaten bare on the peaceful summitof Hogwart Heights . Uniforms and muskets of a haphazard sort had been provided for them , and all that could be accomplishedby a pious reading of the drill manual and a dry history of Napoleonic strategy was done for them by Theodore and his knock-kneed brother in arms . And when war was declared , in April 1861 , the entire enrollment of the academy marched away to battle with Theodore at their head . The trouble between Zachariah and Theodore afterwards was that the war proved to be the great event in Theodore 's life , and he never got over it . His existence had been empty and pointless enough before the war , and afterwards , knowing there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had seen , he developed rather quickly into the professional warrior , the garrulous hero forever talking of past exploits . This is what annoyed Zachariah more and more as time went on , and he never let a chance go by to puncture Theodore 's illusions of grandeur and to take him down a peg or two . Separate volumes could be written about each member of this , remarkable family . A noble biography for Robert , done with 2 Plutarchian pen  --  that is what he deserves . A lusty , gusty Rabelai  --  sian chronicle to do justice to the virtues of old Miss Hattie . A stern portrait of Rufus in the Balsac manner . For Zachariah , his , own salty memoirs would be the best thing , if he had only thought to write them , for he saw through everybody , himself included ; and if he could have been assured that not a word would leak out till his death , so that no political harm could come of it , he would have shamed the devil and told the naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll try to do our best in the pages of this book , but we know full well beforehand that it wo n't be good enough for Theodore . No book , no single pen , could ever do for Theodore what should be done for him . Theodore should have had a group photograph taken of himself . He should have been blocked out by Rubens , painted in his elemental colors by fourteen of Rubens 's young men , had his whiskers done by Van Dyke , his light and shade by Rembrandt , his uniform by Velasquez ; then if the whole thing might havep269been gone over by Daumier , and touched up here and there with the satiric pencil of George Belcher , perhaps in the end you might have got a portrait that would reveal , in the colors of life itself , the august personage of Colonel Theodore Joyner , C.S.A.Theodore rapidly became almost the stock type of the " Southern Colonel-plumed knight " kind of man . By 187o , he had developed . a complete vocabulary and mythology of the war  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Nothing could be called by its right name . Theodore would never dream of using a plain or common word if he could find a fancy one . The Southern side of the war was always spoken of in a solemn whisper , mixed of phlegm and reverent hoarseness , as " Our Cause . " The Confederate flag became " Our Holy Oriflamme  --  dyed in the royal purple of the heroes ' blood . " To listen to Theodore tell about the war , one would have thought it had been conducted by several hundred thousand knighted Galahads upon one side , engaged in a struggleto the death against several hundred million villainous and black-hearted rascals , the purpose of said war being the protection " of all that we hold most sacred  --  the purity of Southern woman-hood . " The more completely Theodore emerged as the romantic embodiment of Southern Colonelcy , the more he also came to look the part . He had the great mane of warrior hair , getting grayer and more distinguished-looking as the years went by ; he had the bushy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . In speech and tone and manner he was leonine . He moved his head exactly like an old lion , and growled like one , whenever he utteredsuch proud sentiments as these : " Little did I dream , sir , " he would begin  --  " little dial I dome , when I marched out at the head of the Joyner Military Academy  --  of which the entire enrollment , sir  --  the entire enrollment , tsol volunteered to a man  --  all boys in years , yet each breast beating with a hero 's heart  --  one hundred and thirty-seven fine young men , sir  --  the flower of the South  --  all under nineteen years of age  --  think of it , sir ! " he growled impressively  --  " one hundred and thirty-seven under nineteen !  --  " " Now wait a minute , Theodore , " Zachariah would interpose with a deceptive mildness . " I 'm not questioning your veracity , but if my memory is not playing tricks , your facts and figures are a little off . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peered at him suspiciously . " In what way ? " " Well , " said Zachariah calmly , " I do n't remember that the enrollmentof the academy had risen to any such substantial proportionsas you mention by the time the war broke out . One hundred and thirty-seven under nineteen ? " he repeated . " Would n't you come closer to the truth if you said there were nineteen under one hundred and thirty-seven ? " " Sir  --  Sir  --  " said Theodore , breathing heavily and leaning forward in his chair . " Why you  --  Sir 1 " he spluttered , and then glared fiercely at his brother and could say no more . Is it any wonder that fraternal relations between Zack and Theodore were sometimes strained ? To the credit of Theodore 's lads , and to the honor of the times and Colonel Joyner 's own veracity , let it be admitted here and now that whether there were nineteen or fifty or a hundred and thirty-seven of them , they did march out " to a man , " and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more the grass grew thick and deep on Hogwart Heights : the school was closed , the doors were barred , the windows shuttered . When the war was over and Theodore came home again , the hill , with its little cluster of buildings , was a desolate sight . The place just hung there stogged in weeds . A few stray cows jangledp271their melancholy bells and wrenched the coarse , cool grass beneath the oak trees , before the bolted doors . And so the old place ' ; tood and stayed for three years more , settling a little deeper into the forgetfulness of dilapidation . The South was stunned and prostrate now , and Theodore himself was more stunned and prostrate than most of the men who came back from the war . The one bit of purpose he had found in life was swallowed up in the great defeat , and he had no other that could take its place . He did not know what to do with himself . Half-heartedly , he " took the bar " again , and for the third time failed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , using money that his brothers loaned him , he repaired the school and opened it anew . It was a gesture of futility , really  --  and a symptom of something that was happening all over the South in that bleak decade of poverty and reconstruction . The South lacked money for all the vital things , yet somehow , like other war-struck and war-ravaged communities before it , the South found funds to lay out in tinsoldierism . Pigmy West Points sprang up everywhere , with their attendant claptrap of " Send us the boy , and we 'll return you the man . " It was a pitiable spectacle to see a great region and a valiant people bedaubing itself with such gimcrack frills and tin-horn fopperies after it had been exhausted and laid waste by the very demon it was making obeisance to . It was as if a group of exhaustedfarmers with blackened faces , singed whiskers , and lacklustereyes had come staggering back from some tremendous conflagrationthat had burned their homes and barns and crops right to the ground , and then had bedecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crying out : " At last , brothers , we 're all members of the fire department ! " Theodore took a new lease on life with the reopening of The Joyner Military Academy . When he first decided to restore the place he thought he could resume his career at the point where the war had broken in upon it , and things would go on as though the war had never been . Then , as his plans took shape and he got more and more into the spirit of the enterprise , his attitude and feelings underwent a subtle change . As the great day for the reopeningapproached , he knew that it would not be just a resuming of his interrupted career . It would be much better than that . For the war was a heroic fact that could not be denied , and it now seemed to Theodore that in some strange and transcendental way the South had been gloriously triumphant even in defeat , and that he himself had played a decisive part in bringing about this transcendental victory . Theodore was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at this conclusion than were thousands of others all over the South who , at this same time , were coming to the same conclusion themselves . But once the attitude had crystallized and become accepted , it became the point of departure for a whole new rationale of life . Out of it grew a vast mythology of the war  --  a mythology so universally believed that to doubt its truth was worse than treason . In a curious way , the war became no longer a thing finished and done with , a thing to be put aside and forgotten as belonging to the buried past , but a dead fact recharged with new vitality , and one to be cherished more dearly than life itself . The mythology which this gave rise to acquired in time the force of an almost supernatural sanction . It became a kind of folk-religion . And under its soothing , otherworldlyspell , the South began to turn its face away from the hard and ugly realities of daily living that confronted it on every hand , and escaped into the soft dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been . The first concrete manifestation of all this in Theodore was anp273inspiration that came to him as he lay in bed the night before the great day when the Joyner Military Academy was to reopen its doors . As he lay there , neither quite awake nor yet asleep , letting his mind shuttle back and forth between remembered exploits on the field of battle and the exciting event scheduled for the morrow , the two objects of his interest became fused : he felt that they were really one , and he saw the military school as belonging to the war , a part of it , a continuation and extension of it into the present , and on down through the long , dim vista of the future . Out of this there flowed instantly into his consciousness a sequence of ringing phrases that brought him as wide awake as the clangingof a bell , and he saw at once that he had invented a perfect slogan for his school . The next day he announced it at the formal convocation . It is true that Theodore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense when it was repeated all over town with Zachariah 's running commentary upon it . The father of a student at the school was one of Zack 's most intimate friends ; this man had attendedthe convocation , and he told Zack all about it afterwards , " Theodore , " this friend reported , " gave the boys a rousing new motto to live up to  --  earned , he said , by their predecessors on the glorious field of battle . Theodore made such a moving speech about it that he had all the mothers in tears . You never heard such a blubbering in your life . The chorus of snif lings and chokings and blowing of noses almost drowned Theodore out . It was most impressive . " " I do n't doubt it , " said Zack . " Theodore always did have an impressive manner . If he only had the gray matter that ought to go with it , he 'd be a wonder . But what did he say ? What was the motto ? " " First at Manassas  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zachariah.  | "  --  fightingest at Antietam Creek " " Yes , fightingest to see who could get back first across the creek ! " "  --  and by far the farthest in the Wilderness . " " By God , he 's right ! " shouted Zachariah . " Too far , in fact , to be of any use to anyone ! They thrashed around all night long , bawling like a herd of cattle and taking pot-shots at one another in the belief that they had come upon a company of Grant 's infantry . They had to be gathered together and withdrawn from the line in order to prevent their total self-destruction . My brother Theodore , " Zachariah went on with obvious relish , " is the only officer of my acquaintance who performed the remarkable feat of getting completely lost in an open field , and ordering an attack upon his own position . . . . His wounds , of course , are honorable , as he himself will tell you on the slightest provocation but he was shot in the behind . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the history of the Confederacy who possesses the distinction of having been shot in the seat of the pants by one of his own sharpshooters , while stealthily and craftily reconnoitering his own breastworks in search of any enemy who was at that time nine miles away and marching in the opposite direction ! " From this time on , the best description of Theodore is to say that he " grew " with his academy . The institution thrived in the nostalgic atmosphere that had made its resurrection possible in the first place , and Theodore himself became the personal embodimentof the post-war tradition , a kind of romantic vindication of rebellion , a whole regiment of plumed knights in his own person . And there can be no doubt whatever that he grew to believe it all himself . According to contemporary accounts , he had been anything but a prepossessing figure when he went off to war , and , if anyp275part of Zachariah 's extravagant stories can be believed , anything but a master strategist of arms on the actual field of battle . But with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until at last , in his old age , he looked a perfect specimen of the grizzled warrior . Long before that , people had stopped laughing at him . No one but Zachariah now dared to question publicly any of Theodore 's pronouncements , and Zachariah 's irreverence was tolerated only because he was considered to be a privileged person , above the common mores . Theodore was now held in universal respect . Thus the youngest of " the Joyner boys "  --  the one from whom least had been expected  --  finally came into his own as a kind of sacred symbol . In Libya Hill during those later years it was to be a familiar spectacle every Monday  --  the day when the " cadets " enjoyed their holiday in town  --  to see old Colonel Joyner being conveyed through the streets in an old victoria , driven by an aged Negro in white gloves and a silk hat . The Colonel was always dressed in his old uniform of Confederate gray ; he wore his battered old Confederate service hat , and , winter or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cape about his shoulders . He did not loll back among the faded leather cushions of the victoria : he sat bolt upright  --  and when he got too old to sit bolt upright under his own power , he used a cane to help him . He would ride through the streets , always sitting soldierly erect , gripping the head of his supporting cane with palsied hands , brown with the blotches of old age , and glowering out to left and right beneath bushy eyebrows of coarse white with kindling glances of his fierce old eyes , at the same time clinching his jaw grimly and working sternly at his lips beneath his close-cropped grizzled mustache . This may have been just the effect of h is false teeth , but it suggested to awed little boys that he was **27;7219;TOOLONG " I think the city heat is too much for you , Frances , " he said at last . " It might be better for us to leave Nurnberg and go nearer the mountains . There 's a nice little resort south of Munich on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you wanted some climbing , we could go farther south into the Bavarian Alps . " lie had n't taken the trouble to lower his voice . Frances wondered which person at the surrounding tables would be interested in all this . No doubt their bodyguard were draping themselves behind some concealing tree , but she had ceased to worry about them . " I 've quite enjoyed it here . " Like hell I have , she added under her breath . " But I should like to see some real countryviews for a change . I find the pavements very hot . And yet , you have simply got to walk if you want to see any of these too too lovely buildings . " The saccharine dripped over her words . Richard was leaning back in his chair , smiling pleasantly at his wife . His eyes were applauding her ; his mind was keenly aware that the handsome woman , who sat two tables away from them , was watching the foam in her beer glass with great intentness . Or perhaps she always studied beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their conversation , he had at least this comfort : she could have heard every word of it . They both thought it a good idea to return to the hotel and rest before dinner . Frances thought she would lie down for half an hour , and read . Richard thought he 'd like a bath . He left the bathroom door open and , as he cooled off in the tepid water , he could hear a page being turned . Once she laughed . He was happier about Frances . The Museum had been a good idea ; there was nothing like ap101Museum for calming one 's emotions . This game was simple enough , he thought , and cursed the lad-lei-less soap . This game was simple enough if you could convince yourself that you really were on holiday ; that as long as you carried no unexplainable documents and neither received nor sent any , as long as you were an apparently harmless tourist , nothing could really touch you . You could give yourself away , of course . If you became flustered or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which hung over you , you might do something which was either stupid or too clever . Either of these actions would be a dangerous weakness . It was no good trying to pretend that a threat did n't exist . It did , all the time . What you must do was to ignore it : acknowledge it and ignore it . The only real dangerpoints were those of the actual contact with an agent . If you were discovered at that moment , nothing on earth could help you . Well , the danger point in Nurnberg was past . It had passed when Fugger had spoken so softly that he had had to strain to hear him . Ile had been looking down at the title page of a book , and the bookseller was searching through some other volumes . " It is better in Innsbruck at this time of year . The Gasthof Bozen , Herzog-Friedrich-Strasse 37 , is recommended . The owner is called Hans , and will help you . He likes music and red roses as we all do . " That had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had the satisfactory feeling that A. Fugger had escaped . He was too wily a bird not to have had all his preparations made for just such a day as yesterday . It would n't have taken him long to get through a window and lose himself in the labyrinth of passagesand small streets which lay behind the shop . There were plenty of rooms there to have rented as a hide-out , or as a place to change your identity . Or perhaps A. Fuggeralready had another neatly established identity practicallynext door to his bookshop . There was no limit to the ingenuity of a foresighted man with sufficient time to arrange things . Suddenly , there was a firm , businesslike knock on the bedroom door . I Ic heard Frances say " Come in . " It might be a maid : sonic excuse , any old excuse . From the bathroom , he could only see the windows of the bedroomand the heavy green brocade curtains . But in his mind 's eye he could see Frances , dressed in that pink frilly thing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyebrowfrom the novel she had been reading . He heard her say , " Yes , it is warm , is n't it ? Please leave the towels on that chair . My husband is having a bath . Thank you . Good day . " It was only when he heard the bedroom door close sharply that he realized he was sitting bolt upright in the bath , his muscles tensed . Frances had remained where she was on the bed ; nor did she call through to him . Thank heavens for that . She must have had a fright when that knock came ; it had n't sounded like a maid . He got out of the bath quickly and made some pretenseof whistling as he dried himself . When he entered the bedroom , Frances was lying on the bed with her eyes fixed on the bathroom door , waiting for him . The novel lay as it must have dropped when the maid had left the room . He felt her force her voice to say naturally , " Hello , darling . Cooler now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head close to hers on the pillow , she whispered , " The knock . . . I thought he had been caught . "  | " Do n't worry , Frances . I do n't think he was . please do n't worry . " She was laughing softly , but it was a poor imitation of her laugh . It was becoming louder ; her hands were cold . " Snap out of it , Fran , " he whispered . He slapped her jaw sharply . That helped . At least the laughing had stopped . He lay with his arm round her shoulders , quietening her with his firm grip . " We 'll leave here tomorrow , " he said at last . " I 'll get you to the mountains for some days . " Frances had recovered , and was looking rather ashamed of herself . " Yes , " she said , " I can always push someone over a precipice if there 's any monkey business there . " Richard grinned . He was so unworried , so confident , thought Frances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " That 's the idea , " he said . After they had dressed , they went downstairs for dinnerin the hotel . Frances had recovered completely . She had worn her smartest dress as a tonic , and the results were good . She was amusing and gay , even over a not particularlygood dinner  --  German cooking was not at its best this summer . Many of the people in the restaurant turned their heads to watch the slender , fair-haired girl . She was easily the loveliest woman in the place , thought Richard with justifiable pride . " That rest did you good , Frances , " was what he said . Frances only referred once to that afternoon . " Youmust n't worry about me , Richard , " she said . " I 'll be allright now . I am like that , you know . At college I used to get quite panicky three weeks before the examinations were due . But once I had got my worry over , I was alwaysperfectly cool when the examinations came . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , with no one to reprimand you for being an exhibitionist . Well , I think it will be the same when whatever is going to happen happens . I was thinking about the war , particularly , Richard . The more 1 sec of Germany , the more I know that a showdown must conic , sonic day ; and perhaps the sooner the better , before they are all turned into robots . X Vhen I think of the children leaving school each year , all of them carefully educated in the Nazi way , I honestly shudder to think what the rest of the world faces in ten years ' time , if it waits . So do n't worry about me , or start regretting that you brought me . I 'm just in the process of adjusting myself between two very different ways of life , between peace and war . Coming here was a good idea after all : it reconciles you to the adjust-ment . " Richard knew Frances was right in her self-analysis  --  she was like that  --  but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't crack before she had reached the cool , calm and collected stage . That would probably come beforethe end of this journey ; at least , he hoped so . Her handicap was imagination . It was more difficult to face unpleasantnesswhen you had imagination . But , as she had said , coming here helped to reconcile the adjustment . It also hastened it , thank heaven . " I know , " he said , and began some amusing suggestions about what they could possibly be drinking . " It 's really only habit which makes me order coffee . A. few more days and I 'll probably lose it , " Frances said.  | " It 's extraordinary what people can swallow for the sake of their beliefs . I heard of a practising surrealist who spent many months eating his wardrobe . " " That sounds a good story , " said a man 's voice . Both Richard and Frances looked up in surprise . " Hello , van Cortlandt . Glad to see you . " " May I come over here , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I know , " said Frances quickly . " I 'm sorry I got so hot and bothered yesterday in that discussion . You know , it is n't easy for us to look at these things disinterestedly . " " And I came over here because I began to feel I might have seemed too darned callous . You see , I 'm trying to look at things disinterestedly , and I 'm finding that is n't easy , either . " " Well , " said Richard , " now that we have all kissed and made friends , what will you have ? " They all laughed , and van Cortlandt said he would have beer . Frances had a feeling that he disapproved of them somehow because they were English , and yet was surprised into liking them when they caught him off his guard . " As a matter of fact , " he was explaining , " I watched you being the only real human beings in a roomful of stuffed dummies , and I thought we were fools if we did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we are n't just like  --  " He nodded over his shoulder in the direction of those concentrating on the mastication of specially chosen vitamins to build a specially chosen race . " Zombies is , I believe , the technical term , " suggested Richard . " Now would you really like to hear the story about the wardrobe ? " They talked for an hour , and then decided to have aP1o6 moonlight walk . The bodyguard joined them outside the hotel , Richard noted . As Frances explained that they were probably leaving tomorrow for the mountains , he wonderedjust who had been watching them inside the hotel dining room . Not that it mattered , not now . They did n't choose any particular way , but just followedany twisting street which would lead them to the banks of the Pegnitz . Away from the bigger streets , the lights were economically dim , but it seemed safe enough  --  even with the two men marching behind them at a discreet distance . In the narrower streets where there were so few people , the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculousness of the whole thing . The American , after his first glance back at them , had ignored the two pairs of feet keeping time with such perfect precision . Later , Richard wondered why he never then questioned the American 's lack of interest . Perhaps he was relieved that van Cortlandt appeared to think that this was only normal ; it would have been difficult to pretend that they had n't noticed a thing . At the time , he only felt grateful for van Cortlandt 's tact . It was a little surprisingin such a forthright , I'm-just-a-plain-man type of individual . Perhaps the American found that frankness could be a very useful front , just as many a Britisher found understatement a safe enough refuge . Both van Cortlandt and Richard were in good form . They talked with a good deal of the fervour and conversationalabandon which have an unexplained way of suddenlyappearing between two strangers , as much to their own surprise and enjoyment as to that of their audience . Frances was very well content to be the audience . They had just cruelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baroque , when Frances clutched their arms , and they moved closer to her . From the quiet blackness of the little alley to the left of them came a bitter cry , the high , self-strangling cry of fear or pain , or both . They looked at each other . " And just what is that ? " asked Richard quietly . He made as if to move into the alley . There was another cry . Frances felt her stomach turn , sickeningly . Van Cortlandt and Richardlooked grimly at each other . " You stay here with your wife . I 'll investigate . " The American had taken a step along with Richard into the alley . " Halt ! " The abrupt command came from behind them . The two men had increased their pace to a run , as they had seen the foreigners become curious . " Halt ! " Van Cortlandt and Richard stopped ; they looked belligerentlyat the men . Frances came to the rescue . " Something 's wrong  --  a murder or something  --  down there . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a walk , " the older one said . " But something is wrong , " the American protested . The trooper who was doing the speaking said , " We adviseyou to take a walk . It is only a Jews ' Alley . " So that was it . Frances thought for one moment that van Cortlandt was going to jab his large , clenched fist right in the middle of that mock-pleasant smile . There was a minute 's silence , broken only by a faint moaning . Frances turned abruptly and walked quickly away . The others followed , and they heard the Germans laugh at something one of them said . They were silent until they were almost at the hotel , and then van Cortlandt spoke . " That 's it , " he said savagely . " Just as you are enjoying yourself and are thinking that life is n't so bad after all , you meet that . Blast them to hell . " " It 's our last night here , thank heavens , " Frances said . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I 'll get the hell out of here . Austria 's next . I 'm working towards Vienna . I have enough material as it is , already , but I ca n't print half of it . The nice kind people in the other world would think I was a liar , or another sensationalist ; and my boss would say I was sent out to report and not to do propaganda which would harm his organization . " " Is that considered at this date ? " asked Frances . " From the strictly business point of view , yes . " Frances began to understand why newspapermen were cynics . They were silent again . All the charm of the night had been broken . Hans Sachs had given way to the Iron Maiden . As they said good-by in the hotel lounge , van Cortlandt gave them his card , and wrote his New York business address on the back of it . " That will always be able to tell you where I am supposedto be , anyway , " he added , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yesterday , or was it weeks ago ? They gave him their address in Oxford , and watched him write it down in his diary . Oxford , thought Frances , where the only scream in the dark came from the little Athenian screech owls . Firm handclasps  --  they were something friendly and honest , anyway . " Tomorrow , " Richard said firmly , as they went upstairs to their room , " tomorrow we leave . "  |p109EARLY  next morning they left for Munich . It was a town they had both known well in the old days . Richard expectedthat they might be still under some kind of supervision , although their uniformed bodyguard had been left behind the walls of Nurnberg . So he chose the simplestthings to do . In the afternoon they walked through the central streets , and for once he had no objections to window-shopping . In the evening they visited the Hofbrauhaus . Frances was pathetically eager to watch the people , the same people she had seen each day when she had been an art student here in 1932 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riddle . Eventually , she gave it up . She shook her head sadly . " I do n't understand it , quite truthfully . There is something in the German soul or mind which baffles other races ; there must be . On the surface , all they have got out of it is a new grandiose building here or there where they can listen to more speeches , and I ca n't think of anything more boring . And they have also got a lot of uniforms , and high-signs , and a firm military tread . But to all appearances , the shops are n't any better , the restaurants are n't any better , the food is worse , so are the theaters and the books . The clothes of the people do not look any more prosperous ; and the trains always ran on time here , anyway . "  | " They have also got Austria and Czechoslovakia and lots of promises , " suggested Richard . " And concentration camps , and universities which are travesties , not to mention the hatred of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wish it had not been necessary to enter Germany . 1Ic thought of the pleasant holiday they might have been having in Switzerland or in the French Alps , or in Ragusa . Some place where the things you saw did n't immediately start grim speculations . . . anywhere except this doomed country . That was what had depressed Frances so much , this feeling of doom which was apparent to the outside observer when he saw how blindly these people accepted their grand illusion . Richard felt as if he were watching passengers in a train whose engine crew were increasing speed , disregarding brakes , while the tracks in front were steep and twisting . Either the train would make the journey in record time , or they would end in horrible disaster . The strange thing , the terrifying thing , was to see the passengers accept the ominous swaying of the train along with the conductor 's glib assurances ; to watch them disregard the fate of the passengers who did raise some objections , even although they had once praised the intelligence of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it all was the fact that all of these passengers  --  except the children , who were encouraged to stand at the window and che'cr violently  --  all of them had been in a previous train wreck . No wonder Frances was depressed . She had always believed that men were intelligent animals . If only the methods of hate and force had been resisted at the very beginning : not by other countries ( for thatp111would have been called the unwarranted interference of those who wanted to keep Germany weak ) , but by the people of Germany , themselves . But , of course , it had been more comfortable to concentrate on their own private lives instead of dying on barricades , if in the last extreme they had had to pit force against force . It was easier to turn a deaf ear to the cries from the concentration camps , to harden their hearts to the despair of the exiles , to soothe their conscience with praise of the Fatherland . And now , it had come to the stage where other peoples would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to stop what should have been stopped seven years ago . Frances spoke again . " I wonder where it will all end ... " " In the hall of the Gibichungs , " Richard said bitterly , and with that he discarded the problem of the German mind . On Sunday , the ninth of July , they arrived in Mittenwald . If Richard had been alone , he would have risked going straight on to Innsbruck , but with Frances beside him it was quite another matter . It was probably just as well that there was Frances , to keep him from taking chances which might lead to disaster . Some days in Mittenwald would help to smooth out any complications which might have begun in Nurnberg  --  and Frances needed the mountains . That was important to remember , with Innsbruck and whatever else lay ahead of them . At first , Richard would only take her for a short tenmilewalk . " Your legs are out of training , and your feet need hardening , " he insisted . The following day , they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing. pII2 By Thursday Frances could manage the Karwendel Peak without any trouble . It was on that day that Richard had begun to feel at ease again . The sense of being shadowed had gone , and Frances seemed as if she had successfully reached her past-worrying stage . They had climbed steadily since eight o'clock , resting almost on top of the mountain to cat the sandwiches the hotel had provided that morning . They sat on the path , their legs hanging down over its edge as it dropped steeply away . Richard watched Frances open the thick hunks of bread , and extract the little grains of caraway from the slabs of soaplike cheese . She dropped them gravely one by one over the cliff , on whose edge she swung her tanned bare legs . Above the heavy-wool socks and the flat-heeled shoes , they looked like a schoolgirl 's , thought Richard , with that attractive mixture of slenderness and strength . The light breeze ruffled her hair , which had curled round her brow with perspiration , and flapped her loose silk shirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeves . Her excavations for caraway over , she slapped the sandwichtogether , and took a lusty bite . Richard found himselfsmiling . There was something touchingly intent in her face as she looked at the Isar rolling rapidly far below them . " It is lovely , " she said quietly , " quite lovely . Look ! " She pointed up the valley , with its green fields and winding ice-blue river . " God made the country , man made the town . ' Pity man could n't learn better . " " He is a messy imitator . He thinks complexity is a proof of progress . " They were silent , with their own reactions to the simplicity of the scene.  |p113At  last , when they had finished their lunch , Richard rose . " Time to move , " he said , and helped Frances to stand up on the narrow path . " Fifteen minutes to the top and then we shall see Austria . " " We have plenty of time , " Frances said , looking at the sun . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head reproachfully . That was one thing he could n't teach Frances ; she could n't resist comingdown a mountain quickly . She would never make a real mountain climber . She was plucky enough , though . She was following him up the last difficult stretch to the top with no outward trouble , although inwardly she was probably cursing in despair . She hated going up a mountainjust as much as she loved coming down . As they regained their breath on the top of the peak , they faced the Austrian Alps , rising in rugged waves of gray stone , snow-streaked . Richard pointed . " Over there lies Innsbruck . We 'll go there tomorrow . We have been recommended by one of your school friends  --  Mary What-d'you-call-her  --  to stay at the Gasthof Bozen in Herzog-Friedrich-Strasse . " Frances nodded . " Mary Easton will do . She 's now married to a man in Central Africa . " " That 's remote enough , " said Richard , and then changed the subject . Frances took her cue from him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the little hotel in Mittenwald . They had put up at the hotel where Richard had once stayed as an undergraduate on a reading party . In those peaceful days , there had been crowds of foreigners , mostly American or English . Tonight , as they sat in the half/empty restaurant , it was all so very different . The owner of the hotel , Frau Koppler , still sat in earnest conversationover a little table with her special friends . She still wore the long-skirted black day-dress which seemed to be part of her . On Richard 's first visit there , that table had always been the subject of jokes by the people of Mittenwald who came in for their beer , or their game of Skat , or to dance and sing if there were an accordion or fiddle to accompany then . Richard looked towards the part of the restaurant which had been partitioned off for the local people . I Ic remembered how shocked Frau Koppierhad been when the undergraduates had preferred to drink their beer there , instead of in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokes had been that she was pro-Nazi , and that she was plotting with her special friends at her exclusive table . The joke was increasedfor the laughing Bavarians because Frau Koppler was a Northerner and they said she was going to Prussianizethem ; and the word verpreussen had also come to have a coarser meaning in the South . Now it seemed as if the joke had become fact . Richard wondered , as he watched Frances arrange the pieces on the chessboard , whether Frau Koppler was as happy as she thought she would be . The hotel certainly was less flourishing : the only other foreigners in the room were an Italian family who talked volubly and excitedly and tightened Frau Koppler 's disapproving mouth . The prices for German guests were much lower , and those tourists who arrived in the middle of the day brought their own food with them . It was an extraordinary sight to watch them open their parcels of bread and sausages at the restaurant tables , ordering one glass of beer , cleanp115plates and knives . Frances was particularly shocked when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overworked waitresses . Richard saw Frau Koppler look over to their table . He pretended to be absorbed in the game of chess . They were no longer shadowed , he felt , but it was noticeable that Frau Koppler had taken quite a lot of interest in their movements . It could very well be possible that such a strong Nazi as herself might be asked to mark anything suspicious about them . It was the kind of little job which she might enjoy doing ; it would add to her feeling of authority . As he waited for Frances to attack with her knight , he wondered whether that look predicted anything , protected his bishop with a pawn , and waited . The music from the wireless set ceased . It was a pity , thought Richard , that the sounds of frying could not be eliminated instead of music with foreign or non-Aryan influences . A man 's voice began to speak , peremptory as on a parade ground . As Frances ignored the pawn , and daringly took his bishop , Frau Koppler rose to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risen to his feet too , taking the opportunity of offering Frau Koppler a chair to warn Frances with his eyes  --  and then the unseen voice ended its exhortations and the music of a very rich band filled the room . Even as the preliminary cymbals clashed they all knew what was coming . Frances remained as she had been , and lit a cigarette . Frau Koppler stood rigid beside the chair , looking straight ahead of her into the wall of the room . Poor old Richard , thought Frances , and watched him redden slightly . He could n't sit down as long as Frau Pushface was standing , and she knew he would n't stand for that song . A hymnp116in glorification of a well-known pimp , he had called it . Frances smoked unconcernedly and watched the chessman fall from Richard 's hand . It rolled under another table , and by the time he had retrieved it , the chorus of the Horst Wessel song had ended and the Munich time-signal tune was being played . Frau Koppler sat down , bowing as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite and innocent . " I hope I am not interrupting you , " Frau Koppler began . " Are you enjoying your holiday ? " They said yes , they were , Mittenwald was a most delightfulplace . Frances let Richard handle the greater part of the conversation . She was n't quite sure , to begin with , why they were being honored with a visit . It was n't very much like Frau Koppler to unbend to any of her guests , particularly foreigners . She was a tall woman , but she held herself so erectly that she seemed taller than she was . Once she must have had some beauty . Her features were still excellent , but the yellow hair and blue eyes had faded , not in the soft and kindly way which gives a certain charm to age , but bleakly . Perhaps Frau Koppler would have thought such charm only a sign of weakness ; she probably preferred the appearance of strength even to the point of hardness . She was , thought Frances , a grim-looking creature . She had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even as she talked , she did not relax . She gave a funny twist to the phrase Behave naturally . Because Frau Pushfacewas behaving naturally , although she could never be natural . She turned to Frances . " I am glad you are enjoying yourself . It is good for people to travel in the new Germany . There are many things we want to show them . "  |p117Frances  looked quickly at Richard , and then back at Frau Koppler . She could n't think of an answer that was n't impolite . She smiled , which was always a solution , even if a weak one . Frau Koppler had n't expected an answer , for she went on , " You speak German very well , very well indeed . No doubt you have visited our country before ? Did you come to Mittenwald by chance , or were you recommended to come here ? I am always interested in what brings people here . " The question was out . What a bore it must have been for her to bother to make conversation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a pity , after all her trouble , that she did not know Richard , and so could n't interpret his smile . He always looked like that when the game was being played his way . He was ready with his answer . " The mountains , " he said . " I enjoyed them so much when I stayed here some years ago that I wanted my wife to see them . " " You stayed here before ? " " Yes ; at this hotel . It must have been almost eight years ago . It was in the off-season , at the very end of September . We stayed until we returned to England to our Univer-sity . " " Ah , yes . I remember now . There were nine students and two very young professors . " She must have known all the time and verified his name from the visitors ' record . It would have been better if she had n't mentioned it at all . It only angered Richard . He had given her the benefit of the doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought was her duty . Now she was a simple-minded woman who enjoyed setting traps and catching people in them . It shed a new light on her position as uncrowned queen of the village . She would wield her political power in rather a mean way . " Yes , " he said . " It was what we call a reading party . " Frau Koppler 's voice was just slightly less assured . " Well , " she said , her tone on the defensive , " you see for yourselves that we are just the same , only so much happier . " Her voice was polite ; it would have been friendly if the smile on the lips had been less fixed . Richard looked straight into the faded blue eyes which did n't smile at all . He said nothing . She looked at the large picture of the unhappylookingroan with the ridiculous mustache , which hung prominently on the wall . She tried again . " Thanks be to our Leader . Igo you not admire all he has done for us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads are the best I 've seen , and the buildingsfor speeches and political gatherings are very handsome , " said Frances quietly . Frau Koppler turned to her with some annoyance . " And a hundred other things . Look at our unemployment . We have n't any . Look at yours in England . It is so large . " " Yes , unfortunately it is , " broke in Richard . He was damned if he was going to let this pass . " But we are very frank about our unemployment figures . " " What do you mean ? " " We count people as unemployed if they are being trained under Government schemes for new trades , or if they are casual or seasonal workers and just do n't happen to be working on the day when the census is taken . Sop119when you talk about England you ought to remember that . " " But that 's madness . . . People trained by the Governmentunemployed ? " " Or facing facts . They ca n't plan to become settled members of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turning them into an army is not a solution , unless waging war is one of their country 's plans . " Frau Koppler dismissed the point as negligible .... Her patience was wearing thin . " How long will you stay here ? " The directness of her question interested Frances . The velvet glove was off . Richard was unperturbed . " I think we 'll leave quite soon , now . We 've done most of the walks and climbs which we intended to do . .. Actually , we have been just discussing tonight where we should go next . Perhaps you could advise us . We had thought of the Dolomites , but I believe it is difficult to visit there , this year . " Frau Koppler was silent ; she did n't want to discuss the South Tyrol . " I think it would be too tragic to go there this year , " said Frances . " Last time we were there , only two years ago , in fact , the people were so sure that the end of Italian domination was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working secretly in Bozen , and they really believed that the heart of the Tyrol would bleed no more . And now they have been forced to leave their land or to remain and become Italians . I often wonder what they think about it all . " A faint pink color surged under Frau Koppler 's pale skin.  | " Then there 's Bohemia , " said Richard . " But I think it would be equally difficult to visit there , today . " " And of course there 's Salzburg . But then the singers and conductors whom I used to admire so much are n't there any longer . " Frances ' voice had just the proper note of regret . Frau Koppler looked first at her , and then at Richard . They were watching her politely , waiting for her to suggestsomething . " You arc very near Austria , here , " she said . " Yes , Austria is lovely , " said Frances . " I remember the wonderful time I had in Vienna , three years ago . Everyone was so gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Richard watched Frau Koppler 's rising embarrassment . Her theory that nothing was changed , unless for the better , was not standing up very well . She shrugged her shoulders . " Vienna has no mountains , of course . I forgot you liked them . Perhaps the Austrian Tyrol . . . it always was popular with the English . " " Do you know of any particularly good place ? " Frau Koppler gave the advice they had wanted . " The train from here goes direct to Innsbruck . It is thecenter of hundreds of excursions . " " That sounds a very good idea , " said Richard . " We can go there tomorrow and then make our choice from that point . Thank you , Frau Koppler , you have been the greatest help . " He rose as Frau Koppler stood up . " You seem to travel a good deal . " It was almost a question . Frances smiled . " It is a necessary part of one 's education , we think . "  |p121Frau  Koppler stood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is strange that so many English travel about , at if they were rushing away from their own country . " Frances looked at her for a moment . " But the explanation is simple . It is only when the English travel in foreign lands that they learn to appreciate many things about their own country . Good night , Frau Koppler . " They turned again to the chessboard . Frances lit cigarette with some enjoyment . When she came to think of it , the conversation had been rather like a game of chess , itself . From their point of view , it had been really quite satisfactory . As Richard took her Queen , she thought of A. Fugger , and his neat , businesslike exit . It was just possible that the police or Gestapo or whatever they called themselves  --  there seemed to be so many organizations in this country , all with uniforms and high-sounding titles  --  it was just possible that they wanted to capture him for another matter altogether . He might have sold banned literature , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret pamphlets . She remembered his first belated appearance , and the smell of burning paper which had come from the back room in the shop . She felt a sudden rise in confidence ; it seemed as if these few days of wind and sun had benefited her mind as well as her body . The mental paralysis which had gripped her last week was gone . She knew now that no matter what happened , she must keep hold of this courage and hope . If she lost these , then all was lost . Tonight she could face a hundred Kopplers , even Nurnberg itself . It was such a relief to be nearing the last stages of this strange journey that even danger seemed welcome.  | " Check , " said Richard , " and mate , I think . " He grinned self-consciously as he saw Frances smile . He could conceal his disappointment at losing a game better than his delight at winning . He bent down to pick up her handkerchief where it had fallen under the table . He tickled her under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriousness . Frances saw that Frau Koppler was looking at them . As they rose , all conversation at Frau Koppler 's table ended . The four men there were watching them intently , while Frau Koppler gave a queenly bow . There was the little white-bearded astrologer who was Herr Koppler , who typed all day in his room and came downstairs in the evening to sit by his wife . There was a fat , genial man ; another fat man , not at all genial , who always wore uniformand his hair cut so short that it bristled ; and the young schoolteacher , very conscious of his discipline and learning , acquired at a Party college . Baldur , the Almost Human , Richard had named him when he had first seen him . The group of men stared openly at Frances as she crossed the room . Richard returned Frau Koppler 's bow , and Frances said good night , looking serenely oblivious of the gazes in her direction . She felt suddenly glad that she did n't live in this village . There were other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obviously stupid , why Frau Koppler disliked her . I 'm too effeminate , she thought , and giggled as she took Richard 's arm to go upstairs.  |p123ON  FRIDAY they arrived in Innsbruck , and succumbed , as they always did , to its outward charm . They left their luggage at the station , and walked towards the **29;7248;TOOLONG busy streets bathed in the soft yellow light of the late afternoon sun . As Frances said to Richard , it was always difficult to tell who was on holiday or who was at work in Innsbruck . There were as many short leather trousers , green-feathered hats , and peasantpinaforeddresses among the young men and women at work as there were among the groups of holiday makers ; but two changes became more and more evident . The holiday makers had the hard German accent of the North , and there was the Uniform . The cafes were busy at this hour . The tourist shops , with their colorful peasant clothes , little wood carvings , flower charms and vermilion-tinted postcards looked gay to the passing glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them . Most of the articles were less imposing , were even crude , close at hand . They had a sort of **25;7279;TOOLONG . It was pathetic , she thought , that " Tyrolean " clothes , bought in the smart shops of large cities far away from the Tyrol , should be better-looking than the originals they copied . It was the tragedy of city hands being more skillful in cutting better material , ofp124colors more carefully blended with the sophisticated designer'seye . And now they were approaching the Herzog-FriedrichStrasse . Frances was looking at the people , at the way in which the towers and steeples around them were superimposedon the background of jagged mountains . One of the chief attractions of this country was its White-HorseInnquality . It could be felt even in a town with tramcars and tourist buses . If this region were to lose that , it would lose much . Frances wondered whether the people prized the asset of charm which lay in their countryside , or would they ever be persuaded into thinking it was effete or sentimental or valueless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thoughts were already at the Gasthof Bozen . The best thing to do on this job , he decided , was to have a general idea of what he was going to do while he still kept his eyes open for any possible short-cuts . A girl , carrying a basket filled with flowers , had paused before them to rest for a moment . She was almost a child , and the flowers were simple garden flowers , arranged into rough bunches . Richard stopped Frances . He returned the girl 's smile . " From our garden , " she said , holding out a bunch . " They are lovely , " said Richard . " But I think I like this bunch better . How much ? " He lifted a bunch with some roses in it : two were red . They paid the girl , and crossed over into the narrow Herzog-Friedrich-Strasse with its arcades and balconies . As they approached No. 37 , Richard took Frances ' ann . They entered the insignificant doorway with its worn sign . On either side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if everything they had for sale must be displayed . Still , theyp125had been comforting , thought Frances , as the heavy door swung behind them shutting them off from the cheery babel of the busy arcade , and left her gripping Richard with one hand and the bunch of flowers with the other . For it was dark in the entrance hall , dark and silent . It was narrow and unfurnished ; it contained only the staircasewhich lay in front of them . The faint light which broke the darkness came from above , possibly from a landing . It reminded Frances of some of the older houses in Oxford , except for the stuffy , sickly smell of stale beer and tobacco . She noticed that Richard brightened . His dislike was the cafes with creamcakes . As he moved towards the stairs , she broke off a red rose , and fastened it through the lapel buttonhole of her flannel suit . She wished she felt as confident as her heels sounded on the wooden staircase . It twisted in an uneven curve to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square in shape . This was where the light came from . It hung over a desk which faced the staircase . There was a man at the desk , watching them through his small half-closed eyes . Or it might have been the largeness of his face which gave his eyes the appearance of smallness . Like two bullet holes in a lump of dough , thought Frances . He was middle-aged , his figure had spread with his years , his square-shaped head bristled with cropped gray hair . At either end of the landing , which seemed to be the real entrance hall to the hotel , were swing doors . They led to two rooms , one which must be at the back , the other at the front , of the house . From the front room came the surge of men 's voices , whenever a waitress pushed open the swing doors . The back room seemed to be the kitchen or the taproom , or perhaps both . The two waitresses hur- lied towards it with empty beer mugs , and returned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so busy that they hardly glanced at Frances , as she waited for Richard to finish his arrangements with the squareheadedman . As the swing doors were pushed open , she could see some of the nearest tables . The men round them were middle-aged , bulky , with faces red from arguing or laughing or drinking beer or all three . Blue tobacco haze coiled over bald heads . There were uniforms everywhere . Once a waitress swung the door wide open , and held it that way with her shoulder and hip , so that another woman could pass through with carefully held tankards of beer . Then Frances saw the flags and the outsize photograph . She looked at the desk where Richard was signing all the usual papers . It had a photograph , too , scowling benevolentlydown on a row of keys hanging on numbered hooks . They seemed to have landed in one of the Party 's own particularhaunts . Richard had finished writing . He beckoned to Frances . Perhaps the man had looked for a moment at her buttonhole , but Frances could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of wandering vaguely , as if he were ill or very tired . . . And then a green-aproned boy appeared , and she concentrated on filling in the details in the printed form . Now the signing was all finished , the man handed Richard a key , and abandoned them to the boy in his slowmoving , disinterested way . As they were led up the wooden stairs , irregular and creaking , he sank heavily back into his seat , and resumed his occupation of staring into the middle distance . Frances glanced at Richard . He gave no sign of disappointment . He was talking to the boy , and was giving himp127the checks for their luggage at the station . The boy would collect it , Innsbruck fashion . Clever of Richard , she thought , to remember that . An arrival by taxi in this narrowstreet , with its mixture of medieval houses and small shops , would have been pretentious and stupidly conspicuous . The way to their room led them up two flights of wooden stairs . Frances had the sudden alarming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stairs seemed to be the wall on her left . On her right was a large well sinking into the hall landing below . There were banisters of course , but they were thinly spaced and quiveredto her touch . After that , she climbed the rest of the stairs well towards the wall side , and tried to ignore the way in which the steps sagged gently towards the well of the staircase . She wished she would n't imagine at such moments what a fire would be like . Probably one could make a spectacular , if undignified , exit by scrambling down the front of the house from balcony to oriel window .. . Probably . The boy replied eagerly to Richard 's questions . He seemed a friendly kind of person . Frances suddenly realized this was the first really friendly smile and voice they had met in two weeks . Except , of course , for the American . She thought of a London bus conductor or policeman , and felt a wave of homesickness strike her . This was the first time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was noticing too much this year , but then this year you could n't be blamed for being coldly analytical . It would have been more comfortable to have visited Germany as a guest , to have been taken out and around by friends . Then you might not have the time to notice or compare policemen and bus conductors . Then you would n't take a late evening stroll past a Jews ' Alley . But somehow , in spite of the grimness , Frances preferred this way ; there was less chloroform , this way . Their room faced the street and was pleasant in its simplicity . No massive furniture here , thank heavens , to smother you in bad taste . Clean poverty had its virtues . Frances went over to one of the windows . Along the street , the varied house fronts rose tall and narrow over the arcades where the shops hid . At the open windows , she could see women in their dirndl dresses looking down on the street . It was as if she were in a theater , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the boxes rising in tiers like those of a wedding cake . Guardi would have enjoyed detailing this scene . Someone was standing behind her . She turned quickly . Richard was gone . It was the thin dark boy in the green apron . He held out a vase of water to her , and pointed to the flowers which she still carried in her arms . " Thank you . That is very thoughtful . " He relaxed with a smile as he heard she could speak German . " The gentleman has gone to the lavatory , " he explained carefully . " Oh . . . " said Frances , suddenly stymied . " Where would the lady like the flowers ? " " Could we move that small table near that mirror and place them there ? " He approved of the decision , and watched her arrange the flowers . " I think that is pretty , " she said , to break the silence . " Very pretty , gracious lady . " His brown eyes were friendly . " I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it as quickly as possible . " His smile was infectious . He might have been going to play a game of tennis instead of pushing a cart with luggage through busy streets . " Thank you . " Frances paused . " What is your name ? " " Johann , gracious lady . " " Thank you , Johann . " He paused at the door . " Is there anything the lady needs ? The maid is having her supper . She will be here soon . " Frances shook her head , but he still stood at the door , his eyes watching the corridor . Suddenly he turned with a smile . " Here is the gentleman , " he said . " Good evening , gnadige Fran . " " Good evening , Johann . " So he had been staying with her until Richard came back , as a sort of watchdog . Was the hotel as peculiar as all that ? She heard Richard 's voice , and there was a smile on his face as he entered the room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Yes , I like Johann . " " His name is Johann ? " Richard 's voice had changed : it was tighter , quicker . Frances raised her eyebrows , and watched Richard sit down on the bed , his eyes fixed on the scrap of rug at his feet . Johann  --  Hans  --  Johann . No ; it probably was n't . . . probably . He looked up to see Frances standing beside him , looking puzzled . He caught her arm , and pulled her down beside him . " Anything wrong ? " " I do n't think so . " He lowered his voice , although the . walls in this old house must have been thick enough for safety . " I was just thinking . . . What was Johann like ?  | Chatty ? I noticed he hovered about here , until I got back . " " Politeness , and really good manners . That 's all . What people used to call a well-brought-up boy . You know , I had the funniest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wanted to . . . oh , it 's silly . I am going all romantic . " Richard remained serious . l le was still half-lost in his own thoughts . " Frances , it 's the rummiest place . I went to see where the bathroom was , and 1 took the chance of having a look round , in general . Most of the rooms on this floor seem empty , but I was almost run over by three expansive uniformson their way downstairs to join the party . You noticed it , by the way ? " " Yes ; it looked like an old boys ' club . " " It probably is . All I 've seen so far are middle-aged men , looking rather pleased with themselves . It may be one of those pubs where Nazi meetings were held secretly when Austria was still banning them . Either we 've arrived in the middle of a reunion of some kind or they always are reuniting . " " That 's cheery , I must say . " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our friends would n't quite expect us to come here if we had a guilty conscience , right into the spider 's parlor , as it were . And then Johann told me that they used to have a lot of English and American tourists here , students who were having an inexpensive holiday ; that some Americans turned up earlier this summer , but that so far we are the first Britishers . He noticed I had written Oxford University on that form at the desk downstairs , so we fit in , in a kind of a way . University people are generally thought to be odd . "  |p131Frances  noted that he looked strained and tired . " What about a spot of food , and some beer ? " She smiled as she saw him brighten at the idea . She stood up and smoothed her skirt . " I 'll wash first . Where 's the bath-room ? " Richard grinned . " It 's absolutely unique , Frances . You 'll love it . " She knew from his tone that she would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Straight along the corridor , past the staircase , to the back of the building . You 'll find it on the balcony there . It 's a square box to one side . You can wave to all the people sitting out on their balconies round the back courtyard . It 's really very matey . " Frances said very slowly , " Richard , you are pulling my leg . I 'll see for myself . " She walked quickly along the corridor . Apart from the additional local color of two pairs of large black boots outside one quiet room  --  Richard had been surprisingly discreet about that  --  everything was exactly as he had described it . As they went downstairs , Richard was whistling softly to himself in a preoccupied way . Frances paid little attention ; he often did that  --  but as they reached the desk , she suddenly realized that the last few bars had taken shape into something she knew . My love indeed my love is like a red red red red rose . Richard was laying their key on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without rising from his chair , he nodded his square head with its bristling hair , and grunted in reply to their good evening . He only looked for a moment at Frances ' hat . When they came in , he was still sitting there . He rose slowly and grudgingly to hand them their key . All his movements were those of a lethargic and not particularly amiable man . This was all that happened for two days as they left or entered the hotel . The room which served as the restaurant was empty in the morning . The swing doors were propped open to air the place , the chairs were piled on the tables , and the two waitresses in old dresses were washing the floors . The tobacco smoke was gone , but the smell of beer still hung in the air . In the evening , the swing doors were closed , shutting in the dull hum of voices , except when the hurrying waitresses , now dressed in their bright dirndls , elbowed them open . Then the wave of voices rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick and heavy . Frances wondered about the grass widows , deserted for the excitements of politics . On Sunday morning , the silent man startled them by asking if they were comfortable in their room . They said they were , and waited . But he only hooked their key onto the board behind him , moving so slowly , with his back turned to them , that they knew the conversation was over . They did n't need to look back at the desk , as they took the first steps downstairs . He would be lowering himself slowly into his chair , folding his hands across his massive paunch , and settling his eyes on his favorite spot on the wall above their heads . As they returned that evening , climbing slowly up the stairs to the rhythm of Frances ' high heels , they braced themselves to face the desk , but no one was there . Just as Richard was wondering if he should risk getting their room key without arousing the owner 's displeasure , Johann appeared . Herr Kronsteiner had just gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the desk . Hep133had taken off his apron , and had become a very dignified Johann . Well , anyway , thought Frances , that disposed of Richard 's theory that Herr Bristleneck did all his eating and sleeping at the desk . But Richard seemed in no way dismayed at having his theories confounded : on the contrary , he was in remarkably good humor as they climbed the rest of the stairs . He was whistling to himself again , softly , and absent-mindedly it seemed . But the wink he gave Frances as they walked down the corridor to their room was not at all absent-minded . Just as they reached the door , the whistling had slid into a recognizable tune . Richard opened the door quickly . He was not disappointed . Inside , standing at the window , looking at the street , was I Ierr Kronsteiner . He stood just far enough behind the white curtain to see without being seen . He turned slowly round to face them as the door closed . Richard 's whistling only stopped then . Richard said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herr Kronsteiner also kept his voice low as he answered . He was smiling politely , his eyes fixed vaguely on the wall behind them . " I came to leave your account in your room , and then I thought I heard you coming upstairs . So I took the opportunityof waiting , so that I could explain any details which might seem doubtful . Many of our foreign visitors find German figures puzzling . I shall be away tomorrow on a short journey , and I may not return before you leave . " For a man of Herr Kronsteiner 's loquacity , it was quite a speech . Richard 's expression was unchanged . " Of course . It is just as well to be quite sure and to have all the details perfectlyclear. "  | Frances glanced at him . There was just a shade of emphasis , a slowness in the phrasing of the words , which gave them a double meaning to anyone who looked for it ; but if Herr Kronsteiner perceived it , he gave no sign . He held two envelopes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to Richard . He waited . Richard ripped the envelope open , and extracted a sheet of paper . Frances , still watching him , saw a shade of disappointment pass over his face . The envelope had contained a bill , just an ordinary hotel bill . The name of the hotel headed the piece of paper , followed by the name of the proprietor . It was RUDOLF KroNSTIENER . He saw Fugger 's head against the row of dusty books , saw the scarcely moving lips . . . " The owner is called Hans . . . He will help you . . . " " Thank you . I think everything is quite clear . " Richard spoke abstractedly . Would he risk it ? It was now or never , he felt . On what he said or did depended everything , everything , including Frances ' safety . At least the man had come to their room , with a very elaborate excuse . That had been the first step , either for or against them . The next step was his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Except , of course , one silly idea I had . I thought you were the proprietor . " " I am , " the man answered gravely , but his interest seemed aroused for the first time . " Really ? Then it 's my mistake completely . I thought the owner 's name was Hans , not Rudolf . " Herr Kronsteiner smiled . " Everyone knows that it is Rudolf . " He looked at the envelope which he still held in his hand . " God in heaven , how could I have made such a mistake ?  |p135I  gave you the wrong bill . My apologies , Herr Professor . " I l is calm smile belied the amazement of his words . To Frances , sitting on the edge of the bed , her hat with its red rose lying beside her , it seemed as if here were not only a maddening man , but also one who either enjoyed his own mystery , or  --  and that was a disturbing thought  --  believed in precaution even within those thick walls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation here , except when they had lain close together in bed . Could their low voices , deadened by the soft feather pillow , have possibly been heard , even if this room was wired for sound ? Richard 's precaution , which from the very beginning she had been inclined to deplore secretly , now lost all its theatrical appearance and began to look like wisdom . Richard was smiling too , as he read the second bill very carefully . He was memorizing something . " Everything is quite clear now , " he said . " Would you like the bill paid this evening , or will tomorrow do ? " " That does not matter very much , but we have a rule in this hotel that all accounts must be paid each Monday . Tonight or tomorrow , it does not matter . One more thing I must trouble you about . All the rooms in the hotel have been reserved for a political conference this week . It beginson Wednesday . " " Oh , we intended in any case to leave Innsbruck either tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reply had , pleased Kronsteiner . He had given his warning , and Richard had taken it . He positively beamed , although his voice was as impersonal as ever . " In that case , I am glad I saw you this evening , for I may be away when you leave . I hope you have enjoyed your visit here . " " Very much indeed . " It was Frances now who spoke . It seemed to her that it was time she said something . Herr Kronsteiner bowed , and moved with unexpected quickness to the door . He paused before he opened it , slowly , cautiously . Without looking back , he suddenly slipped out . They could n't hear his footsteps in the corridor . For a large , heavy man he could walk with surprising lightness . Frances felt that someone ought to say something . " Was the bill high ? " " No , it was rather reasonable . Now what shoes did you want to wear ? " Frances looked at the bed . . . But if Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . Any suggestion he made had its purpose . She knew that by this time . She changed her shoes and washed her hands and face in cold water . She felt the better for fresh powder and lipstick . She wound a white chiffon scarf as a turban round her head ; she was beginning to hate the sight of the red rose , anyway . As she finished tucking the ends of the scarf in place , she saw Richard watching her in the mirror . He was smoking his pipe , and in the ashtray beside him were the crumbled ashes of the paper which he had used as a lighter . His Baedeker was open on his knees . " Ready ? " Frances nodded . She picked up a clean pair of white gloves and a fresh handkerchief . Richard had risen and replaced the guidebook in its drawer . He emptied his pipe into the ashtray , and stirred the ashes with his penknife until he was satisfiedthat no piece of charred gray paper could be seen . Thep137bill which had been handed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table beside the flowers . Downstairs , Johann was still at the desk . He interrupted his conversation with two men , whom Richard recognized as belonging to the uniforms which had practically marched over him on the evening of their arrival , to wish them much enjoyment . He could recommend the film at the cinema in the Maria-Theresien-Strasse . His friendly brown eyes followedFrances downstairs , along with the open , noncommittalstare of his companion . One of them said something , the other laughed . Frances took Richard 's arm , and pressed it . Her quietening touch , she called it . They heard Johann 's voice raised in their defense . " But the English are a truly German race . " " Which is probably the highest praise one could have from a German , " said Richard bitterly , as they closed the heavy front door . " I wish , " he added , " that we could afford the luxury of a scene . Just once . " Perhaps Richard had been infected by Herr Kronsteiner 's supercaution . Anyway , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square towards the Maria-Theresien-Strasse , he chose the moments of isolationto tell Frances they would leave tomorrow for Pertisau am Achensee . " It looks a decent sort of place on the map , " he said with some pleasure . " Are we near the end ? " " We 'll know when we meet him . " " Then what ? " " We 'll go to Ragusa , and post back the letter of credit . " " And if we do n't find him this time ? We have n't many days left , have we ? "  | " We 'll have to try again , and perhaps again . After that , if there are no results , I 'll wire Geneva , and we 'll get back to London . We were given a month . It 's now the sixteenth of July . I think we 'll manage it in time . " " Then you have a suspicion this may be the last stop ? " Richard only smiled as an answer . They had reached the pavement and , surrounded once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cinema . Outsideits doors , Frances paused to look at the stills . " I think I 'd rather have a drink , " she said . " You 've got sense , " an American voice said behind them . They both turned in amazement . Yes it was , it was Henry van Cortlandt , sardonic grin and all . He shook their hands as if he really were pleased to see them . " It was your wife 's hat sort of thing which caught my eye . It 's pretty smooth ; not the kind of headgear a good Hausfrau wears . I 've just been in there , and I came out halfwaythrough . I 've been wondering what to do until it 's time to go to bed . And now you are here in answer to my prayers . The drinks are on me . We 'll catch up on local color . I know a place where we 'll get plenty . " As they walked towards the restaurant , there were explanations . Van Cortlandt had finished his assignment in Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tactfully did not ask them where they had been , or where they were going . Frances filled in the gaps with what she always called girlish gossip . Tonight it served its purpose well enough . As they sat at a table in the beerhouse , they all relaxed and prepared to enjoy themselves . Both Richard and van Cortlandt had stories to tell , and there was no need to worry about the conversation . It was pleasant , thoughtp139Frances , to lean on a table , to watch the curling cigarette smoke , to listen to laughter and voices raised in friendly argument . There was one thing about living under this kind of government  --  every moment of enjoyment was treasured . You appreciated any moments without fear or restrictions , and when they came your way , you made the most of them . There was a pathetic kind of determination to have a good time in the faces around her . It had touched even her . When they had sat down at this table tonight , she had made up her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to forget everything except that they were on holiday . The men ordered their second large steins of beer . Frances left the conversation to watch the people around them . She noticed a young man , sitting alone at a small table , making the best of his splendid isolation . He was vaguely familiar . He looked suddenly towards them , and his eyes met hers . He hesitated . Frances felt that he knew her , that he was waiting for her to smile . When she did n't , he looked away quickly , and became absorbed in a large family party in front of him . Richard became aware of her look of concentration . He stopped what he was saying to van Cortlandt to ask , " Anything wrong , Frances ? " " I 'm just thinking , darling . " " It looks rather painful . " Both men regarded her with some amusement . " I 've got it . . . the young man in the train . " Richard did n't look any the wiser . " The beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brother , Richard , you know the one . He 's here . " " Young Thornley . Good Lord . Where ? " " Over there . "  | Richard looked . " You 're quite right , Frances . It is . " " He looks rather lonely . " " Well , we 're not nursemaids . " Richard was annoyed . Van Cortlandt laughed at Richard 's expression . " Why do the English abroad avoid the English abroad ? " he asked . " Well , you know what we call a holiday . . . a change . But actually , he may not want to join us , and might only do it out of politeness . " Van Cortlandt looked surprised . He was n't convinced . " Now who would think up that reason ? " They all laughed . " I Ic might be waiting for someone , but I think he looks too bored for that . He is not annoyed ; he is just bored . " It was Frances again . The young man decided everything by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassmentat finding three pairs of eyes focused on him . Richard gave a wave of his hand , and the young man rose and came towards them . " I hope you do n't mind my butting in , " he said , " but I have got very tired of laughing by myself . " The American looked at Thornley just the same way he had looked at Richard and Frances when he had met them in the FiveCorneredTower . It was a quiet summing-up , disconcertingin its frankness , but Thornley , like the Myles ' , pretended to be unaware of it . He sat down beside them , and started to talk . He was amusing , and seemingly lighthearted . Frances watched van Cortlandt make up his mind ; after he had had half an hour of Thornley , she felt the judgment was mainly favorable . She sighed with relief ; she felt responsible for Thornley . Van Cortlandt had decided , she could guess , that Thornley was a nice , amusing individualp141with a lot of charm  --  and not much else . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could revise that estimate . Frances guessed also that van Cortlandt had n't thought any revision would be necessary . " Where 's your friend ? " asked Richard , when the rush of conversation offered its first pause . " Tony ? Oh , he should be here any day , I hope . That 's why I 'm hanging about Innsbruck . We went to Prague , you know , and did n't find ourselves made welcome by the  --  authorities . Things were a little difficult , really . It seemed easier if we split up , and if I came here to let him get his job done . " The mention of Prague had interested van Cortlandt . " Did you run into trouble ? " he asked . Thornley nodded . " A little . " He saw that they were all waiting for him to explain . I is could hardly ignore the interestin all their eyes . " Is Tony in danger ? " asked Frances . At least , that would give him the chance to say no , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a girl . " Van Cortlandt and Richard exchanged glances . " What 's wrong with that ? " asked the American with a smile . " Nice healthy pursuit , " agreed Richard . " Usually , " said Thornley . " But in this case she is the daughter of a professor who was n't exactly popular with the new regime . " " Do n't tell us , unless you want to , " said Frances suddenly . " Probably I 'd be better confiding in someone . You 've no idea how miserable you begin to feel inside when you . ca n't talk to anyone . I 've been waiting here just like that for two weeks . . . . The story is simple and innocent enough , Heaven knows . Tony began worrying about this girl when he heard her father had been removed . He had met her in England last summer , and since May he has become determined to get to Prague to see if she were all right . He had the idea of marrying her and getting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we got to Prague . It was n't particularly pleasant for us , being English . " He paused reflectively . " It became obvious that I was inclined to get involved in things , and there was no sign of Tony 's girl . In the end , he thought it was better for him to do the job alone . He can control his temper better than I can . So I came on here , and I 'm waiting for Tony and his girl to arrive . I said I would wait until the end of July . " " What happens if he does n't turn up before the end of the month ? " asked van Cortlandt . " That would be a nuisance . I 'd have to go back to Prague . " " I 'd like to join you . " " Would you ? " Thornley was pleased . " It 's mostly strain , I warn you . Not very pleasant , really . The Czechs are suspicious , the Germans are intolerable . I ca n't say I blame the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time , you see , and then you start to be haunted by the girl , too . Tony 's infected me . " " Did you know her ? " " I 've seen photographs . And Tony would say something , now and again . She seemed a winner . " " Perhaps she is in hiding with her father , " suggested Frances . Thornley looked at her . His gray eyes were colder ,  |p143brighter  . " He is definitely dead , " he said gently . It was the kind of gentleness which shocked them all into silence . Frances noted , as she lit another cigarette , that van Cortlandtwas looking at Thornley in a different way . The revision process had no doubt begun . Richard ordered more beer and coffee for Frances . " We are leaving tomorrow , " he intimated , " for Pertisau . " Frances blinked her eyes , and tried to look unconcerned . It was hardly the change in conversation which she had expected . " I envy you , " said Thornley . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere . At least , it was , four years ago . I suppose it is still : the small villages keep to their own ways longer than the towns , and mountains and forests do n't change . " " I envy you , too , " agreed van Cortlandt . " Sidewalks in summer become just one cafe table after another for me . Climbing is n't up my alley , though . I 've never understood why people go up , when all they can do is conic down again . But I 'd like some real swimming . I have n't had much chance of it , this summer . " " Then why do n't you both take a few days off , and come along ? " Both van Cortlandt and Thornley looked surprised . " You both look as if you could do with some time off , " said Richard , and left it at that . Thornley and van Cortlandt eyed each other speculatively . Each was probably wondering if the idea would be as attractive tomorrow as it seemed tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American . " It certainly seems a good idea , " said Thornley.  | " I 've some business to do here . It depends on that , " qualified van Cortlandt . " And I 'd hate to butt in , " finished Thornley . They both looked at Frances . She sipped her coffee , and regained her composure . " Richard never makes a suggestion out of mere politeness , " she said . " If he actually invited anyone , then that means he really would like them to accept . " She smiled to the two men , and added , " I think it would be fun . " " Yes , " agreed Thornley . " Well , I 've had a grand evening , " said van Cortlandt . " It would be a pity to miss any others we could have . If I can arrange the business on hand , I 'll take you up on that suggestion . " Richard finished the debate . " We 'll be there for about a week , and if we leave before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . If you can make it , then turn up anytime you feel like it . We 'll leave it at that . I do n't know where we shall stay , yet . Let 's say the Hotel Post ; there 's always a Post in Austria . If you ca n't manage it , then we 'll see you in London , we hope . " They rose , and straggled to the door . The restaurant was nearly empty ; it must have been later than any of them had imagined . They parted with a good deal of warmth . Frances , who had been drinking coffee , wondered how much the beer had to do with it all . She watched the American and the Englishman walk away together , still talking their heads off . " I 'd like to see them again , " she said and took Richard 's arm . " I wonder if they 'll come . You know , Richard , you did give me a shock when you suggested it . Wo n't it complicatematters ? "  |p145Richard  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked them . It 's strange , how you can meet some people , and you might as well have been spending the evening looking at a fishmonger'swindow . And then again , you meet others , and a small flag waves , and you are a fool if you ignore it . " " Especially nowadays , " said Frances . " I 'm all for gatheringthe rosebuds while we may . " The street was almost empty . The light tap of Frances ' heels alone broke the silence . She waited until they had reached a part of it where they were sure of being quite safe . She lowered her voice . " Did the second bill tell you whom we are to see ? " " He 's a chess collector , this one . Welcomes any fellowenthusiastto view his collection . It should be easy getting in touch with him . " That was all Richard would tell , then . When Frances spoke again , it was about van Cortlandt and Thornley ; she was still worrying about endangering them . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they come . What 's more , we were told to behave completelynormally . So I did . " Frances added nothing to that . For one thing , they were approaching the hotel . For another , she had the dawning suspicion that Richard was going to leave her under the young men 's protection while he was being a fellow-enthusiast . She would see about that.  |p146JOHANN  was charmingly regretful in his mild way , next morning , when he found them completing their packing . He advised Richard about the trains , and arranged to take their suitcases to the station . As he spoke , he watched Frances pack bottle and hairbrushes into her fitted hand case . " How beautiful , " he said involuntarily , and then reddenedas Frances looked up in surprise . " That leather , how is it made ? I have admired your shoes each day . The materialis so good . " He looked at their flannel suits . " I do n't quite understand it , " he went on . " Are English sheep and cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Frances kept her face serious . " No , Johann , I do n't think they are . Perhaps it is because the English are a slow and careful sort of people . Sometimes slowness has results . " She would like to have added that even if his country had n't got materials like these , they had always plenty of tanks and aeroplanes , but she did n't . Johann 's sense of humor did n't stretch to the irony of that . " Yes , they are slow people , I have heard . Their thoroughnessis different from ours ; sometimes it seems strange that they should ever get results . " He hesitated . " May I ask the Herr Professor a question ? Do you think there will be war ? "  |p147Richard  paused in locking his suitcase . He chose his words carefully . " Well , that depends , Johann . It depends on Germany . If she makes war against Poland , then there will be war . " " But why should England go to war for Poland ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not deserve to be obliterated . " " But you did not go to war for the Czechs . " " You agreed that the British are slow . It has taken time to change them from hopes of peace to a determination to fight , if it is necessary . If Poland is attacked , the British will see that as a sign that fighting is necessary . It is quite simple , Johann . If Germany does not want war , then she must not attack Poland . " " Another war would be a dreadful thing , " said Johann . " Do many of your friends feel that way ? " asked Frances . " Of course , gnddige Frau . We are human beings . " " It seems so strange then that Germany should have twice built up the most powerful army in the world , within thirty years . Armies cost a lot of money , Johann . And the money is wasted unless the armies arc used and pay for themselves by winning . It is a very danger , us thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is at peace . " Johann was searching for a reply ; what was it he had heard so often ? " But , " he said at last , " we have to prepare against at-tack . " " From whom ? " asked Frances gently . " From all our enemies . France for instance . " " Johann , do you really think that if France was pre- pared for attack she would ever have had to sign at Munich ? Tell me , when you lived in what was called Austria , were you all afraid of being attacked by France ? Did you feel then that you must have the biggest air force in the world ? " Richard signed to Frances to case up . As he explained afterwards , it would only land the boy in trouble if he really started to think for himself . Johann was indeed looking worried . " If only you could live in our country for some years , you would understand , gnadige Frau . " Frances , in obedience to Richard 's signal , contented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ready , Johann ; you can take them away whenever you like . Leave the checks for them downstairs at the desk , and we shall get them there . " " Yes , Herr Professor . " Johann looked unhappy about something . Perhaps it was that he had n't made any convertsto his cause . Or perhaps , thought Frances , he had found a question which the answers he had learned did not fit . " You have made our stay very comfortable , " said Frances , and was glad to see him cheer up . " And when you have that hotel of your own in the Tyrol , you must let us know , and we shall come and stay there one summer . " Johann flushed with pleasure ; he saw that she meant what she said . " It would give me the greatest pleasure to have you at my hotel , gnadige Frau , " Johann said with unexpected dignity . " Good-by , Johann , " said Richard . It was always he , it seemed , who had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Frances again , and left them at last.  |p149Frances  walked over to a window , and looked silently down on the street . " You would have made a good father confessor , " said Richard , and lit the cigarette which she held between her lips . It was really extraordinary how people would talk to Frances ; more extraordinary how she would listen . " Do n't let the tragedy of the human race get you down at this time of the morning . Come and have some breakfast , first . " He drew her gently from the window . " An empty stomach only turns thought into worry . " Frances smiled and kissed him . " You keep worrying about me , Richard . " " Well , whenever you start a train of thought these clays , it runs non-stop to the sorrows of the world . " " I 'm sorry , Richard . I 'll give up the habit . " " Do . It would be frightful if you ever began to enjoy it. , , Frances laughed . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression to enjoy her secret thrills of pity ? No , thank you , Richard . Instead , 1 ' 11 become accustomed to the idea that man is born in pain , lives in struggle , dies in suffering . " " Well , that 's a better defense against the new Middle Ages than the nice ideas you got from your liberal educa-tion . " Over a cafe table , they made their plans . Frances was suddenly demanding action . She wanted to get to Pertisauas soon as possible . By the time they had finished their late breakfast and had walked back to the hotel , the baggagechecks awaited them , along with a final bill . Herr Kronsteiner had already left , it seemed , and Richard paid the grim woman who sat behind the desk . He left more than the usual tip for Johann , placing it inside an envelope along with his card on which he had written Good luck with your hotel , and a tip for their invisible chambermaid . Perhaps she had been this grim-faced , silent woman . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenbach would leave in less than half an hour . From Jenbach they could hire a car to take them to Pertisau .... But it was n't until they were in the train , with their suitcases settledsafely above their heads in their compartment , and they were watching the pleasant valley of the Inn spreadingout before them , that Richard really relaxed . He admitted to himself for the first time that he was surprised that they had got away so simply , that his distrust of Herr Kronsteiner had been unfounded . He had looked like a man who would sell his own sister to the highest bidder . He must be a pretty useful kind of agent to have ; crooked men would trust him , because they thought they could use him . Richard was still speculating about Herr Kronsteiner when their short journey ended , and the train stopped briefly at Jenbach to leave them and some other tourists on the sunlit platform . Richard lifted the two suitcases and joined the largest group which had jammed round the exit . Franceskept very close to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who was taking the tickets would only notice her , and no more . And then they were out into a broad roadway of hot white dust . There were two decrepit buses and some cars . The tourists , once the first burst of activity of leaving the station was over , had begun to straggle as they made up their minds . That gave them the chance to hire one of the cars . They had already left the station road , and were turning into the outskirts of thep151little town , before the others had found scats which suited them and places for their luggage . Their car finished the steep twisting climb from Jenbach , and regained its speed on the road leading round the western side of the long narrow Achensee . Halfway up the lake , the road ended . And there was Pertisau , smiling with the sun on its green meadows to welcome them . It was n't the usual village . It gave the appearance , as the road curved into the bay in which it lay and they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape architect'sdream . At the edge of the shore , divided from it by the last of the road , were the hotels and chalets . Behindthese , in the large sweep of meadows stretching back to the wooded mountains , lay the peasant houses like a scattered flock of sheep . A very small , neat pleasure boat was taking on passengers at the small neat pier . Everything was neat , even the arrangement of flags fluttering from the bathing houses on their own part of the shore , or the patternof striped umbrellas shadowing the tables in front of the hotels . It was , self-admittedly , an artificial tourist center , but its smallness and neatness gave it much charm , and some dignity . The forests and mountains were very real , anyway . The valleys between the mountains convergedon Pertisau like the lines of a sundial . There would be good walking and pleasant climbing , thought as they had skirted the south end of the lake , and had wondered dejectedly if any of them could be Pertisau . In her relief , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no accommodationto suit them could not dampen her high spirits.  | The manager of the hotel was sorry , but there were no double rooms vacant . If the lady and gentleman would consider separate single rooms , or a room in one of the villas . . . There were some which catered to visitors when the hotels were full . . . Most comfortable .. . Highly recommended . And of course they would have their meals at the hotel . So they left their luggage at the hotel , and followed the manager 's assistant across the road and over a field to a house . It was called " Waldesruhe , " although the woods were at least half a mile away . But it seemed both clean and comfortable . Frances liked the petunias in the window boxes and the balcony in front of their bedroom with its magnificent view of the lake . Richard liked the impersonal owner , who took everything for granted in her calm , disinterestedway . This sad-faced woman would not add to their complications . But he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , after making " arrangements " as the manager euphemistically said , and leaving notes for van Cortlandt and Thornley , he found the quiet landlady talking to Frances on their balcony . " It really was n't my fault , " said Frances . " It was simply that she was delighted to see someone who did n't come from Germany . They are having a rather bad year , here . Most of the visitors are Germans . With special rates , of course ; and they spend next to nothing . They crowd into the hotels , and all the other visitors are chased away . I expectit 's the way they eat their soup . Remember ? " " I believe you , darling . " " Really , Richard , all I said was , as she stood and looked at me on the balcony , How lovely it all is . ' It was said to myself . And then she began to talk . "  | " Darling , do n't explain . You 're too kind ; you just wo n't hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of boredom , some day . " " 1 rather liked her , Richard . And she kept looking at me , not rudely , not inquisitively , but just as if she wanted to . All the time she talked , she was looking at me , and the strange thing was that I did n't feel embarrassed . There was a sort of pathetic expression in her eyes . I just could n't ignore it . " Richard laughed , and kissed his wife . " Darling , " he said for the third time , " I love you . Now come and see Perti-Sall . , They went down the light-pine staircase into the squareshapedroom with its small windows and fluttering starched curtains . Like their bedroom , the furniture was simple in comfortable peasant style . Frances noted the number of hand-embroidered or crocheted mats on every available surface in the room . Frau Schichtl must have a lot of spare time , she thought , and followed Richard through the doorwayonto the coarse green grass which surrounded the house . They chose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lakeside and its holiday loungers . Richard was thinking about something . At last he said , " Where does Frau What's-her-name sleep ? Do you know ? " ' Not near us , my pet , if that is what has been worrying you . There is an empty room next us . It separates us from a Leipzig honeymoon couple , and these are all the rooms upstairs . And a bathroom of course . The name is Schichtl , anyway . " Richard looked admiringly at her . " Now do n't tell me that you found all that information popping out of Frau Schichtl 's cash register . . . . I must say , my Frances , you have a knack . " " Now , " said Frances , " it 's your turn to tell me some-thing . " " What ? " " Do n't be a brute , Richard . No one can possibly hear us . " She looked at the houses across the fields , their wide overhanging roofs anchored with roped stones , their windowboxes gay with rich-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logs . " You take a long time to think up an answer , Richard . " " Well , darling , there 's no need , is there , for you to know more than you do already ? " " Richard , will you stop doing a Pimpernel ? I do n't talk in my sleep and , anyway , I sleep only with you . " Richard watched two distant figures cutting the grass . Their scythes flashed rhythmically . " All right , " he said . " This is all I know . We were to come to Pertisau . There is a Dr. Mespelbrunn who has a house here . He collects chessmen . We have to see him , and tell him we heard about his collection in Innsbruck . That is what makes me think that he may be the man we are looking for . None of the others knew where we came from . But here we have Dr. Mespelbrunn who knows about Innsbruck . He is also a musician , it seems , and likes to talk music as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he does n't think we stink , he will unburden himself . And then we can have our holiday , and send old Peter his Geneva telegram AR  --  RIVING FRIDAY . That 's all . " " So that 's all . . . . Now , Richard , just tell me what was written in Herr Kronsteiner 's second bill . " " More or less as I 've said . "  | " Well , what was that ? " " You 're an exasperating creature , are n't you ? " Frances only smiled and waited . Richard looked at her , and then recited : " Innsbruck recommends you to Pertisau am Achensee . Dr. Mespelhrunn . Collector of chessmen , songs , flowers . " " Thank you , my sweet . I just wanted to be quite sure you were n't trying to do me out of some fun . " Richard was all injured innocence . " Now , really , Frances  --  " I mean , could you have possibly thought of Henry van Cortlandt and Robert Thornley as such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance ? " Richard began to laugh . " Some day , " he said , " I 'll have to believe in woman 's intuition , or is it just woman 's sus-picion ? " " Now that 's all settled , " said Frances , " let 's look at the view . " Their road had led them clear of all the houses . The fields now lay behind them ; in front lay scattered twisted trees on a stretch of green grass . It was here that the paths into the converging valleys began . They found a rough wooden seat under one of the small twisted trees beside a small stream . Only the gentle murmur of the running water broke the silence of the valleys . The mountains circledround the meadows , and the sky had arranged its high summer clouds in appropriate clusters to balance the jutringsof the peaks into its clear blue . " It 's a neat job , " said Richard , at last , " almost too neat to be natural . " " Yes , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really Tyrolean set . I expect a chorus of villagers to enter at any moment . " " I 've been wondering at that . It 's not exactly a hive of activity , is it ? There were a few men over there working with the hay , or long grass , or whatever it is . We 've seen one woman scrubbing a table at her door , and another woman gathering in some washing . Now and again I heard the sound of trees being felled in the forest . Perhaps they find tourists more profitable than the land . " " Found , " emended Frances . " Here are some children anyway . " Three large-haunched cows ambled slowly towards them , the bells at their throat sounding a gentle melancholy with each lazy step . Behind them were the children , four of them , their straight hair sun-bleached and their bare feet and legs stained nut-brown . The cows wandered past them , flicking the flies from their dun hides carelessly . Frances , looking at them , thought of some people she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have been bored so long that they do n't know what to do about it . Numbed into contentment . " The children had halted . They were staring at Frances , at her suit and her silk stockings and her high-heeled shoes . When she spoke , they retreated , still staring stolidly , and then when they were at a safe distance they turned and ran , whooping with laughter , after the cows . Richard was grinning with amusement . " Nice to be young , " said Frances . " Then you can laugh at the other fellow , and leave it at that . You never think that the things which make you laugh can also strike you cold with horror . "  | " Stop thinking about goose steps and a property mustache , " advised Richard . " Do n't worry . I 'm out of the dangerous stage of being mesmerized with fear . If I 'm cold now , it 's with anger . " " That 's safer , anyway , when you are dealing with those birds , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionately . " Nice little avenging fury you 'd make . " They chose another road back to the shore of the lake . It- led them towards a group of trees , sheltering houses more closely grouped together . As they approached this small center , they noticed two or three little shops , and even some women and children , in the road which had almost become a village street . There was an inn and a beer garden , which looked as if the inhabitants of Pertisau might be able to enjoy themselves after all without any help from tourists in imitation dress . " Signs of civilization , " said Richard , but he surprised Frances by not entering the beer garden . A small shop which was part of a house seemed to attract him . They crossed the narrow street , and looked at its window filled with wood carvings . Most of them were of the **35;7306;TOOLONG , but on the back shelf were a few carvings of really good design and careful workmanship . The finest of these were two chessmen . Frances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good a way as any , " he said , and led Frances into the shop . It had been the living room of the house . Now there was a table facing the door , on which more carvings were displayed . Behind this , under a window at the side of the room , was another table covered indiscriminately with shavings , chips , blocks of wood and instruments to cut andp158mold them . On the bench beside the table was a man . He rose slowly , coming towards them with a half-carved piece of wood still in his hand . He looked at them keenly , and then smiled . " Gruss Gott ! " he said . " Grass Gott ! May we look at your carvings ? " " Of course . The lady and gentleman are welcome . " He went back to his bench and started his work again . Now and again , the would look up to sec what held their interest . He nodded as Frances admired some figures of the Three Kings . His best , most careful work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chessmen which Richard was now examining with interest . " How much are these ? " asked Richard . The man watched his face as he told the price . It was reasonable for the amount of work in the carvings . " It takes much time , " the man said , as if trying to excuse the charge . Frances wondered how often it had been rudely beaten down by people who had ignored the time , the skill and the love which had gone into such work . " The price is not high for such craftsmanship , " said Richard . " I 'd like a set of these to take back to England . " " The gentleman collects chessmen ? " The woodcarver was delighted . " Then you will see something . I have still better ones ; some which I do not sell . " He rose , quickly this time , and went to a heavy chest at the back of the room . He opened a drawer and took out a large box which he carried carefully to his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over here . . . " They went , and as they looked at the contents of thebox , they found it not difficult to express their admiration . " I do not sell these ; they gave me too much pleasurep159when I made them , " the man explained . Frances noted the large clumsy hands , knotted and gnarled with age , and wondered at their expertness , at the delicacy of their creations . " Do you ever make copies of them , for anyone who wants to buy them ? " " Sometimes . But it takes a long time . A gentleman who lives here in the summer months has asked me to copy them for him during the winters . I have made him one set , and here is another which I am now carving for him . " They were suitably impressed . " He must know a lot about chessmen , " said Richard , hoping for the best . It came . " Herr Doktor Mespelbrunn ? Yes , indeed . He has a large collection . He lived in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Grodnertal pieces . " " Really ? " Richard hoped his admiration of the Grodnertalwoodcarvers was emphatic enough . " But why do the lady and gentleman not go to see Herr Doktor Mespelbrunn 's collection ? 1 lc shows them to people who really admire and understand . " Richard looked doubtful . " I should like to see them very much , but after all we arc complete strangers to Dr. Mespelbrunn . I should n't like to disturb him , especially as I am only an amateur . . . " Richard 's words were cut short by the old man 's laughter . " The lady and gentleman would not disturb the Herr Doktor . He does n't work ; he writes music . " The woodcarver'sjoke lasted him quite a long time . " Perhaps , " said Richard , when he could , " perhaps I may have the honor of being introduced to the Doctor some day when I visit you again . "  |p160The  woodcarver pursed his lips and shook his head . " He does n't come down into Pertisau much during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if you pass his house  --  it is the large house with the red shutters on the Pletzach  --  you should visit him . You can say that Anton advised you to go . It is a very beautiful collection . " " Perhaps we shall , " said Richard , and dismissed Mespelbrunnfrom the conversation by placing an order . He insisted on paying Anton half the price in advance , the rest to be paid when the pieces arrived in Oxford . " That seems fair enough , " Richard said to Frances as they walked hack to the lakeside . " By the time he can start work on them , summer will be over , and then he will know whether it is any use starting them at all . I 've no doubt that he will be worried about the deposit , but he earned it . " They met groups of men returning from the woods , with their axes slung over their shoulders . They were lean , weather-tanned men , slow-moving and silent . They might have been a group of Scots shepherds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was even the same upward lilt in their voices , as they gravely answered " Gruss Gott . " Some of the older men smiled in surprise as if they had n't expected the old greeting from a present-day visitor . Childrenhad finished their task of herding cows , anti were playing outside the open doors of the houses . Their clothes made them look like miniature adults . Smoke was beginning to curl up from the stone-anchored roofs . There was the smell of cooking food in the air , and the high tight voices of women when they are hurried and tired . Down at the lakeside , there were also preparations for supper . Here the women were changing one undistinguisheddress for another , and no doubt fixing their hair asp161unbecomingly as possible . Those of them who had already succeeded in looking grim enough to satisfy the requirementsof a superior race sat at the tables in front of the hotels , contemplating their husbands with housewifely virtue . The men talked and looked at each other . The women looked at the men . Behind them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters . A gramophone played in the little cafe where the younger men were . There were not so many young men , Frances noticed , nor were there many young girls . Perhaps the new Germany had tether plans for the holidays of its youth . " A few more years of this , supposing that there was no war , " said Frances , " and no one , who was n't a German , could bear to come to the Tyrol . " " I always know you mean what you say when your sentences run away with themselves , " teased Richard . And then he was serious again . " We had better not rush things at this stage . The ice gets thinner as we get farther out , you know , and the shore is less easy to reach . I 've a feeling we ought to play doubly safe . Peter 's man , the one he sent out before us , must have nianaged Nurnberg and Innsbruck ; although to tell you the truth , I had begun to think when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we are going to be very innocent for a couple of days . We 'll relax . What about climbing that blighter tomorrow ? It 's an easy one to begin with . " I-1e nodded to the Birenjoch , black with the sun behind it . Frances smothered a smile over her husband 's idea of relaxation . " All right , darling , " she said . They left the quiet road , and turned towards the Villa Waldesruhe . It was as peaceful as its name . There was no sign of the honeymoon couple or of Frau Schichtl . As Frances unpacked , she sang . Richard dropped his book on the balcony , and listened as he looked at the steep drop of the mountains on the other side of the darkening lake . He did n't know when Frances had stopped singing , or how long she had been watching him from the door . He rose hurriedly . " One of those adequate five minutes , " he said awkwardly . He looked at Frances ' hair and lips . " Darling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The master race will disapprove . " " Too busy eating soup , " said Frances . " Nothing , not even their principles , could ruin their appetites . " She was right.  |p163THEY  did climb the Barenjoch next day . As Richard had said , it was easy , and it was also useful . Richard spent a lot of time on the peak , studying with his map and pencil the lie of the valleys which met in the green plain of Pertisau . They could see the Pletzach , flowing at the base of the mountain opposite them like a very narrow , very looselytiedwhite ribbon . If they were to follow the stream up round that jut of mountain into the valley which it sheltered , they should find Dr. Mespelbrunn with his chessmenand music books . Frances watched Richard . He was interested in the mountains , unsuspected from the lakeside , which stretched into the distance in rough-tongued waves . Two of the valleys led to paths which would take them over that sea of jagged stone . " Looking for a quick way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do us much good in that direction , " said Richard . " That 's Germany . I wish to heaven that Pertisau had tucked itself near the border of a nice healthy place like Switzerland . Still , even if we have to make a dash for it , it is just as well to have a choice of directions . YesterdayI was worried because Pertisau was such a bottle-neck . " " You seem to expect fireworks . It 's difficult to think of any danger or evil lurking in this kind of place . " Frances settled down on Richard 's Burberry , and fished for a ciga- rette in one of its pockets . She lit it , and lay back to look at the sky . " How are we going to do it ? " she added . Richard folded up his map carefully and put it into his pocket . He stretched down beside her and watched the clouds . " I think Anton is our best bet . We 'll just walk in , one of these days , and ask if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chess collection . Anton 's name will get us past any servant who 's about the place . All other excuses are pretty obvious . " " Such as ? " " Well , you could need a drink of water , but unfortunatelythere 's a nice mountain stream running down that valley . Or you could sprain your weak ankle , and need help to get back to the village . But that 's rather a poor effort . " " I 'm glad it is . " " So we shall just blow in , probably on Thursday or Friday , when Pertisau has looked us over and accepted us . There 's no use risking everything by an enthusiastic dash . For if this Mespelbrunn is Peter 's man , then an explanation for his silence would be the fact that he was under observation . And if he is under observation , then his visitorshad better be very natural indeed . " " He must be able to speak German pretty well , if Anton and the others in the village accepted him . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so peculiarthat he could easily pass himself off as a real Berliner . When he is in Berlin , he has a Viennese accent , no doubt . " " Well , I am looking forward to meeting him . " " Are you definite about that ? "  | " Quite . You are n't going to leave me out at this stage . You know , Richard , the man in Paris was very efficient . So were the others , but they seemed simpler , somehow . " " 1 should think the Paris man is second in importance to Mr. Smith himself . The beginning and the end , as it were . Fugger and Kronsteiner are just moveable pawns in the game . " " I keep worrying about poor old Fugger , " said Frances . " I wonder if he did get away . " " If he had n't , we would n't be here . Or , we would have been continuously followed until they could catch us with another agent . Do n't worry about A. Fugger . He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountainside . " I thought I heard voices , " he explained . He was right . Below them were two men . Frances rose to her feet . The two figures paused and then waved their arms and shouted . " It 's Henry M. and Robert Thornley , " Frances announced . " You know , " she added in amazement , " I never thought they 'd come . " Richard got up . He waved and halloed back . Van Cortlandtyelled something which they could n't make out ; but Thornley was laughing , and they laughed too . The Americanseemed to be in good spirits . HIe kept calling remarks to them which sounded funny although they could n't hear them . At last the two men came over the last piece of rock , and dropped on the ground beside Frances . The American regained his breath , and pointed to his face . It was crimson . " Well , " said Frances , " if you will climb at twice the normal pace and make wisecracks to go with it  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much pride as if he had been fishing for marlin , " is my first mountain . " " We are overcome , " said Frances gravely , and handed him some sliced orange . " It was a most spectacular appear-ance . " Robert Thornley explained . " We motored from Innsbruckthis morning , at the most ghastly speed you ever saw . We found the hotel , and then your house . A nice old thing  --  " " Frau Schichtl , " suggested Frances. "  --  told us you were up here . It looked easy , so we came . " " All lies . Perfidious British lies , " said van Cortlandt . " I drove Bob as gently as if he were in a wheelchair on the Boardwalk at Atlantic City . When we found you were n't there with flags of welcome , he dragged me away from a very nice little table beside a lot of water . And then he told me it was no climb at all . Just kid 's play . " He looked sadly at his shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frances laughed . " Remember to borrow some of our first-aid kit tonight . " " Do you mean to tell me I 'll feel worse tonight than when I climbed this mountain ? " " Your feet will , in these shoes . Cheer up ; it was n't a bad climb for your first . " " Was n't bad ? It 's darned fine if you ask me . " " Well , have a sandwich , " said Richard . " We 're glad to see you . " As they ate , they explained further . The pavements of Innsbruck had become hotter and harder after the idea of Pertisau had been put before them . Last night they had met and celebrated together , and had suddenly decided top167get away from cafes and conducted tours for three days . Van Cortlandt felt he was due a vacation , anyway , and Thornley was becoming bored with being bored . " It 's the first real holiday I 've had in two years , " said van Cortlandt . " I 'm always either going someplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye open and an car listening . I 'm going to forget all that for three days . I 'll have to be back on Friday . Until then I am going to have some peace for a change . " Frances caught Richard 's eye . " How do you like the view we arranged for you ? " she said quickly . Richard pointed out the different peaks . Over there was Germany . Down there were the Dolomites , and then Italy . Here the Danube would be flowing to Vienna . Back there would be the Alps of Switzerland . " So this is what makes some people want to rush up to the top of every mountain they sec , " said van Cortlandt . He looked at Thornley pointedly , so that they all laughed , but in the end he was the last to leave the summit . That night the promise of Innsbruck was kept . They enjoyedthemselves . By the time they had finished dinner , and had gone into the hotel lounge for coffee , most of the other guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " suggested Frances , and giggled . She was in rather good form tonight . She had been worrying during the last two days that if the two of them did come to Pertisau , perhaps the party would be a failure . But everything was going well . She looked at van Cortlandt , leaning forward to catch Thornley 's words with a smile on his lips , a smile ready to break into a laugh when the point of the long story was reached . Richard was lighting his pipe contentedly , his eyes on Thornley who had now risen to his feet to give full justice to the climax . It was when they were all laughing that Frances noticed the man . he was watching them . He sat alone at a small table , a dark-haired man with bold black eyes , heavy eyebrows and a prominent jaw . He was probably about thirty , guessed Frances ; and already his muscles were running to fat , but he was powerful enough . She noticed the tightness of his shirt over the expanse of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thickness of his neck , seemed all the tighter because of a black tie firmly knotted . It was a strange way of dressing for a summer evening . The jacket slung over a chair was a drab green , his only concession to the Tyrol , for he wore black breeches and boots . Just as a retired Navy man can be spotted by his taste in neat navy blue , so it was easy to guess how this man had spent much of his time . Take away the Tyrolese jacket , and add a black one , and a heavy black cap , and a holster at his belt , and a rubber club , and he was typed as accurately as in a Hollywood casting office . His eyes had been fixed on Thornley . They suddenly swung round to Frances and became aware of her scrutiny . Frances let her eyes pass through and over him , fixing them on the deer 's horns just above his head . She held them there until he had stopped looking at her , and had risen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careless gesture , ignoring two which fell on the floor . She was very busy lighting a cigarette , as he walked loudly out of the room . Van Cortlandt had noticed the last few moments , and was watching Frances with a smile of approval . " You got out of that nicely , " he said . " That 's one of the boys in the back room . I 'll lay you five to one . "  | " Big odds , " said Thornley . " Do n't tell me that the Gestapofinds its way to a place like this . " " They 'll find their way to any place , even into countries which are n't under Germany  --  yet , " van Cortlandt repliedsourly . " They give me a bad taste in my mouth , " he added . He began a story about them . Frances listened , but she watched Richard . Apart from a tightening of his lips , he did not seem disturbed by anything . " Not one of the pleasanter types of humanity , " summed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An eveningwalk before they went to bed seemed a good idea . Van Cortlandt looked at his wrist watch , and raised his eyebrows . " It 's only a quarter of ten , " he protested . " I have n't been to bed at this hour since I was in kindergarten . " " Do n't you feel you 'd like to be a dog , and just risk it once ? " Frances asked gravely . Ile looked at her quickly , and then laughed . " I 'm learning something by living among the English . I now know when to risk a laugh . " Richard and Thornley had gone ahead . Frances slowed her pace . Van Cortlandt was trying to disguise a limp . " Let 's sit here , until the others come back , " suggested Frances , as they passed some chairs tilted drunkenly against a table . " Thanks . . . this foot is a nuisance . " " I 'll give you some stuff to doctor it , tonight . Everyone has foot trouble on their first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hesitated . He said suddenly , " You know , you 're all right . I have to admit that I did n't think so much of you when we first met . Apart from being easy on the eyes , of course . I thought you were a hidebound Tory . " " You must have thought me rather suppurating . " She smiled , and added , " Perhaps I am . But I 'm no Tory . " " So I found out this afternoon . That was quite a talk we had , coming down that hill . I 've been thinking it over since , and although I still stick to my own opinion , I begin to see why my remarks in Nurnberg made you so mad . You must have thought me  --  " he paused for the word . " Smug ? " suggested Frances gently . " Now , that 's pretty steep . Or did you ? " " Well , I must say I thought you inclined that way . " Van Cortlandt looked glum . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't do so well myself , did I ? " They both laughed , and then Frances was serious again . There was a sadness in her voice which she no longer tried to disguise . " You see , if it comes to a showdown , it 's the much criticizedBritisher who 'll have to foot a good part of a pretty bloody bill . We 'll need words of encouragement from the sidelines , not jeers . And I wish you could believe me about appeasement . After all , you would n't call America a prohibitioncountry today , although you lived with it for years . " " I see your viewpoint , " said van Cortlandt . " It 's another angle , certainly . But . . . " He shrugged his shoulders . Frances was silent . The moon was on the water of the lake , and she could see van Cortlandt 's face , white in the blue light . He looked even less convinced than his words . A thwarted idealist he had said , this afternoon . Cynic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders toop171and tried to smile . Van Cortlandt was watching her . " Do you know you were being followed in Nurnberg ? " he asked suddenly . " Yes . " " In a jam ? " " Not so far . " " Sorry if I seem inquisitive , but I just wondered when I saw that bird circling us tonight . " " I do n't think that meant much . Sort of incidental music . " The American looked embarrassed . " Look , I know you would have told me about it , if you had wanted to . But all I 'm trying to get at is this : if you are in a jam , you can always let me know . " " I ca n't tell you about it , Henry . Not because I do n't want you to know , but because there 's no use complicating things for you . I 'll tell you all about everything later  --  in England , if you 'll come and visit us there . " " You need n't worry about me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself . " " But you are not so sure about us ? " " Oh well . I mean , you 're not the kind of people to handle trouble ; you 're not tough enough . I wish I could put it better . I mean  --  " Frances nodded and laid her hand on his arm . " You 're all right , too , " she said . There were footsteps on the road , and they could hear Thornley 's voice , and then Richard 's in a fluting falsetto . " What the . . . " began van Cortlandt . " Merchant of Venice . ' Last act , I think , at the beginning . " She began to laugh . " We can manage the midday sun , but not moonlight . Meet it is you set it down in your tables , Henry . You know , that chapter on the peculiarities of the British . " " Now when did I tell you I was doing that ? " " All books on European travel or politics have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an Englishman unless he was funny-peculiar or funny-ha-ha . " " And what does the Englishman think about that ? " " He does n't really care what people think about him , as long as he knows himself . " Richard and Thornley had timed their duet well . Richardmanaged to get the last line in , just as they reached Frances and van Cortlandt . He grasped Thornley 's arm in a fair imitation of maidenly flurry . " But , hark , I hear the footing of a man , " he ended , and looked wildly round . " You 'd be safe enough if you looked like that , " said Frances . " Limping , anyway , " added van Cortlandt , " so you 're safe twice over . " " That role does n't really do my powers justice , " said Richard . " You should see me as the second witch in Macbeth . ' Now that 's something . " " Not tonight , " said Frances hastily . " Let 's all limp home to bed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unison towards the hotel . As Frances and Richard said good night , van Cortlandt looked as if he wanted to say something , but he did n't . He seemed worried again . They crossed the road to the Villa Waldesruhe . Frances was silent as they went upstairs , and silent as she removed her earrings and brushed her hair . And then she rememberedabout van Cortlandt 's limp . She searched quickly forp173the methylated spirits and boracic and lint . Richard made a good-humored grimace , and started putting on his shoes again . She heard his footsteps echo on the empty road outside , and began to undress . When he returned , she was already in bed . " That fellow was back again , talking to the manager . " She blinked sleepily . That fellow  --  " Oh , Beetlebrows ? " " Yes . He must think we are lunatics , chasing about at this hour with first-aid . " " All the better , " said Frances , " or is n't it ? " " Does no harm . Only next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get my shoes off . " " Yes , darling . " She yawned prodigiously. " . . . doing tomorrow ? " Richard folded his trousers before replying . When he did , Frances gave no answer ; she was , like the rest of Pertisau , asleep.  |p174FRIDAY  came quickly for Thornley and van Cortlandt , slowly for Frances and Richard . They had enjoyed the bathing and climbing , the strange conversations which had a habit of cropping up , as much as the other two , but , as Frances said , Friday was like taking medicine : she wanted to get it over as quickly as possible . On Friday , the mists were on the mountains , and the waters of the lake looked gray and uninviting . It takes salt water to make a bathe , when the sun is n't shining . Van Cortlandt was disappointed , for this was his last day . On Saturday he had to meet a radio man in Innsbruck , who wanted some impressions from him for a broadcast to America next week . Thornley thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cortlandt . He had begun to worry again about Tony and his Czechoslovakian girl . He wanted to make sure that his Innsbruck hotel had n't mixed up his Pertisau address . Over their eleven-o'clock beer , the arrangements were made . And then came the suggestion from Thornley that once the Innsbruck business was finished , he and van Cortlandt should return to Pertisau for a couple of days . At this , Richard looked slightly taken aback . By Sunday , God knows what would have happened . The two men noticedhis slight hesitation , the vagueness of his reply . There was what Frances called a pregnant pause . She felt miser/able , trying to explain to them with her eyes and her smile that it was no lack of enthusiasm for them which had caused Richard 's embarrassment . Van Cortlandt suddenly saw daylight . " Of course , your movements are indefinite , we know , " he said and looked hard at Thornley . Frances had the feeling that he had told Thornley about their being followed in Nurnberg . The feeling was confirmed when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone from Innsbruck , and find if you are still here . That is , if you do n't mind . " " That would be fine , " said Richard , obviously sincere , and the difficult moment had passed . " It 's a pity you must leave today , " said Frances . " There 's a dance this evening . " The men looked bored at the idea . " No , not in one of the hotels , " she went on , reading their thoughts . " It 's the real thing , held in one of the inns back near the woods . They build a platform outside the inn , and everyone comes from miles around to dance in their best clothes . Some of the costumes are really perfect , and it 's fun to see people really enjoying themselves . " " When does it begin ? " asked van Cortlandt . " Nineish . " He shook his head . " Too late for me ; we 'll have to leave about six . But say , if you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How on earth did you find out about the dance ? There 's no notice up anywhere that I could see , " Thornley said in amazement . " Oh , I have my agents , " said Frances , and then blushed as Richard looked amused . " Actually , it was Frau Schichtl . She told me about it this morning , and said very pointedly that we would be welcomed "  | " That 's rather strange , do n't you think , considering their German cousins are all over the place ? You would think that they would be the ones who were welcome , and that we outsiders would be avoided like the plague . " " Lower voice , " suggested Richard quietly . Frances followed the suggestion . " No , it was quite the opposite . Frau Schichtl was eager for us to go and meet the real Austrians . She offered me the Sunday dirndl dress her daughter used to wear . Very lovely it was too . " " She really is awfully decent , you know , " Thornley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round to beat you up . " Van Cortlandt stared . " Bob , what the  --  " " To beat you up or to hound you out or to collect you , " Thornley explained as an aside . " Anyway , while we waited in that downstairs room , Frau Schichtl was baking in the kitchen . It was a damned good smell , too . So we looked in and made some jokes in terrible German , and we had to taste the cake just out of the oven . Have n't done that for years . " " I seem rather left out of all this , " said Richard . Frances laughed . " No , you are n't . Frau Schichtl said you were very well brought up and so polite . And she loves your imitations of the Bavarian accent . " Richard reddened . " Oh , come ! " he said , and the others laughed . But van Cortlandt had sensed a story . " Where 's the daughter ? " he asked Frances . She studied her hands and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if that is what you are thinking , " he added with a wry smile.  |p177Frances  hesitated , but the others ' curiosity had been wakened . " She is dead . Some years ago , she went to Vienna to study singing . Frau Schichtl had saved a little money , and the girl was eager . She must have had some talent to get her %% ay like that . But instead of becoming a great singer , she fell in love and got married . He was an active Social Democrat . They were planning to come here to visit Frau Schichtl ; they had n't much money , so they had to plan it carefully . And then the Nazis arrived . The husband 's name must have been on their blacklist . They said he committed suicide . Nothing more has been heard of the girl . " She paused . " Frau Schichtl says that I look very much like her , when she left for Vienna . " Van Cortlandt said , " She may not be dead . " " Frau Schichtl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then van Cortlandt said again , " just another . That 's what gets me down . It is n't just an isolated case . Wherever you go beneath the surface in this damned Nazi setup , there 's tragedy , or something twisted . Nothing but complications , and fears , and threats . Even those who think they 've jumped on the bandwagon are still standing on one leg . Only the dumbest of them can forget they are on the edge of a volcano . A nice crop of neurotics they 'll be after whatever is going to happen has happened . " " Or corpses , " said Thornley unexpectedly . " They 'd make a fine row of corpses . " Ile looked speculatively at the froth rims in his beer glass . The story of Frau Schichtl 's daughter had started him thinking again about Czechoslovakia , thought Frances . She watched them finish their beer , each man with his own thoughts . The truth was that therep178was no peace of mind left for anyone  --  for anyone with a heart . Richard had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this afternoon . Frances and I thought we 'd take a walk , and let you pack and make your arrangements . We 'll be back to give you a send-off about six . That 's the time you thought of , is n't it ? " It was more of an intimation than a suggestion . Thornley caught van Cortlandt 's eye , and the two men exchanged smiles . " That suits us , " the American said , and then added almosttoo casually , " and if you ca n't be good , you know what . " Frances and Richard left Waldesruhe at three o'clock . Richard had calculated that the distance from Pertisau to the red-shuttered house was about two miles . Yesterday , as they had climbed a hill with a view of the Pletzach , Thornley had pointed the house out to them  --  standing isolated in a high meadow above the little river . It was a good sort of place to have for the summer , he had observed . He was one of those who got a simple kind of pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to own . There were already three places on the surrounding hillsides which he had selected as admirable for a summer chalet . As they passed the Hotel Post , Thornley waved to them from the doorway , but he made no move to talk to them . As they entered the road which would lead them up the Pletzach , Frances glanced involuntarily over her shoulder . He was still standing at the hotel door , his hands in his pockets , and she had the feeling that he was making a very good pretense of not watching them . So his appearance atp179the door had been no accident . That gave her a comforting feeling . At least someone who knew them could vouch that they had left Pertisau quite normally . The deceased when last seen appeared to be in good health and normal spirits . " He 's a good person to have around in a crisis . " " Who is ? " asked Richard . " Bob Thornley . He tries to avoid discussing anything he feels very deeply about . It 's as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers up with a funny story or one of these jokes against himself . And yet he notices quite a lot that is going on around him . " " He 's no fool . Neither is Henry , but in another way . Did you know that Bob was an amateur golf champion of Belgiumand Germany ? Henry unearthed that . He would , of course . Now there 's another who is afraid of his emotions , but he takes refuge in being so damned critical that he becomes a sort of perpetual Doubting " Thomas . Yet underneath , he has plenty of the right reactions . I Lis heart is in the right place even if he has trained his mind to respondwith a firstly , secondly , thirdly . When he forgets about that , then you feel he 's made of very real flesh and blood . I bet his life is a conflict between what he thinks is the clever thing to do , and what he wants to do . " " And which wins ? " " I said he had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . I liked him when he lost his temper . He summed up everything I feel very neatly . It 's strange how well Bob and Henry seem to hit it off ; they have so many differences . I suppose it is a case of accepting them , and resisting the urge to reform the other fellow . "  |p18o  " They 've both got sense , " said Richard , and taking advantage of the fact that they had passed the houses at this side of the village , and that they were the only people on the quiet , narrow road , began to discuss their plans for the last time . He had chosen to approach the house quite openly and directly , so that if it were being watched , their reason for the visit would be believed . If they were to approach it in any roundabout way , it would be difficult to explain such caution . Frances could sec the sense in that , although it seemed almost too simple to her just to walk up to the house and ask for Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was already a feeling of excitement prickling her spine . It was just half-past three when the road , now scarcely broader or more definite than a cart track , curved round the foot of the hill which buttressed the mountain range on their right . Only then could anyone from the road see the house . It was planted neatly in the middle of a broad green meadow on the sheltered side of the hill , the side which had been hidden from them as they approached from Pertisau . It lay peacefully isolated . There was no sign of any life in the wooded valley which it commanded , or on the mountains which walled in the valley . Behind them , the jutting arm of the hill had so completelycut off the road by which they had come that Pertisau seemed blotted from the map . The mists had risen from the mountains , and the wind had dropped ; the branches of the trees were motionless , the leaves were still . There was n't even the sound of a woodman 's ax . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth and shallow , over its gravel bed . " This is where we branch off , " said Richard , as theyp181reached a low wooden bridge over the stream . Across it was a path leading up to the fringe of trees which grouped themselves round the meadow . Behind the house , they thickened into a small forest which covered the slope of the hill like a neatly clipped beard , and spread onto the mountainside , which lay behind . When they reached the first of the trees , they saw that a track separated from the path to take them across to the front entrance of the house . Richard looked at Frances . " Smile for the dicky bird , " he said , and forced one out of her . They left the shelter of the trees to climb up the gently sloping grass . Frances wished she felt as cool as Richard looked . His small talk on the beauties of nature was faultless . For once , she could not think of a thing to say . It was a small house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encircling the upper story , and shutters with the conventional heart-shaped decorations . The large window boxes at the edge of the balcony were filled with petunias . Perhaps there were more windows than a peasant would have thought necessary , but otherwise it was the kind of house which someone who had lived in , and loved , the Tyrol might build as a summer escape from his town life . Someone who had indulged his taste for an additional romantic touch in the red of the shutters . They made a convincing and yet inconspicuous landmark . The heavy front door was closed . Richard knocked , and as they waited , they looked at the stretching valley below them . Thornley had been right ; it was a perfect place to build a house . The rain clouds of the morning had disappeared , and the sun warmed the stillness all around them . They heard the door open behind them , and they turned to face a woman . She was past middle age , largeboned , with the impassive face of a peasant . Her graying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; her largeknuckledhands kept smoothing her apron . " Good day , " Richard said . The woman nodded , but did not speak . " Is Dr. Mespclbrunn at home ? " At the name Mespelbrunnher eyes moved quickly from Richard to Frances , and then back again . Richard tried again . " I am interested in chess collections , and I have been advised by Anton in the village to visit Dr. Mespclbrunn , who has some very fine pieces , I believe . If Dr. Mespclbrunn were at home , perhaps he would have the great kindness to let me see his collection . " The woman was still silent . She was not altogether stupid , thought Richard , remembering the quickness of her glance . Could it be that she was afraid ? Then the woman suddenly looked behind her , and drew quickly away from the door . Yes , it was fear , all right . A man came out of the shadows . He must have been listening quite quietly all this time . " Dr. Mespclbrunn ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had pushed the grayhairedwoman to one side , and stood in the sunlight with a smile on his dark face . It was the man who had watched them in the Hotel Post three nights ago . He was as swaggering as ever as he held the door wide open and bowed them politely into the house . Frances felt her legs prepare to run back down the hill as she looked at that welcoming smile ; but Richard was waiting for her to enter . They found themselves in the large room , a mixtureof a sitting room , a lounge , and a study.  | " She 's just a dumb peasant , " said the man with a still broader smile . Richard ignored the remark . He repeated the sentences he had addressed to the woman . " But of course . " The hoarse voice was being genial , but the effect was far from pleasant . " If you wait here , I 'll get 1 ) r . Mespelbrunn . He is reading in the summer house . " The man left them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a precision which grated on Frances ' nerves . She exchanged looks with Richard , but neither spoke . She had hated this man at first sight . Still , they must see Mespelbrunn before they passed any judgments . The man might be only a very clever touch of realisticcolor . She remembered the grim Kronsteiner and his hotel . There was no doubt that Peter 's friend had a peculiar sense of humor . This might only be another example . She drew her cardigan more closely round her shoulders , and lit a cigarette . She walked slowly round the room , feeling it like a cat . It was a pleasant room , a man 's room , smelling of pine logs and tobacco . She noted the walls of natural wood , the leather armchairs , more comfortable than elegant , the functional disorder of books on every table and music on the piano . A low table stood in front of the deep couch before the open fireplace . An open fireplace  --  perhaps an Englishman lived here after all . Yes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An Englishman lived here . She turned to Richard . He was standing before the piano , his hands deep in his pockets , his lips pursed . He nodded silently to a piece of music displayedprominently on the stand . It was their old friend . I le shook his head disapprovingly . Rather obvious , was what he thought . He moved away from the piano towards the fireplace and lit another cigarette . They heard foot- steps outside ; a man 's voice spoke as if to a dog . It was only a short command , but the words were English . She sat down in the nearest chair and tried to look as calm as she did n't feel . Richard 's calm gray eyes held her own for a moment , and then she started to count the steps in the staircase at the end of the room . She had reached the ninth stair when the front door opened . They both stared in amazement . The tall man who had entered was equally taken aback . Ile recovered himself before they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect English , " this is a pleasure . " Richard smiled ; his eyes were calm again . " How extraordinaryto meet you here , " was all he said . The Freiherr Sigurd von Aschenhausen moved quickly over to Frances and bowed low over her hand . She smiled , but inside she was angry . An Englishman , indeed , with that acute Oxford accent so carefully cultivated in his years of free scholarship . Would Mr. Rhodes have enjoyed this joke as little as she did ? Probably less .. . " We came to see a Dr. Mespelbrunn , or rather his chess collection . We were told in the village that it was the thing to do . " Richard looked at von Aschenhausen blandly . The German smiled . " Well , you 've found him , you know . " " Are you  --  But why on earth  --  " began Frances , and hoped that the laugh she gave was sufficiently amused . " How really very funny . But why take such a wretched name as that and give up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaily , dear Heaven , she prayed , to talk nonsense like a sweet little fool . " It 's perfectly simple , " said von Aschenhausen . " When Ip185live here I have to be very careful ; it would be impossible to use my own name . " He paused but the Myles ' only looked at him with polite surprise . " It would be too dangerous for me , " he added , lowering his voice . But they still looked at him politely , as if they expected him to go on . " Cigarette ? " he asked Frances , and flicked open his gold cigarette case . As he lit her cigarette , she noticed the braceleton his left wrist . The bracelet was of fine gold , too . She pretended she thought he had meant to change the subject . " You are looking very well , " she said . One up , she thought , as she noticed the flicker of disappointment in his eyes . " You have a charming place here , " she rushed on , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is delight-ful . " " Yes ; it is beautiful , " von Aschenhausen said , emphasizingthe stronger adjective . Someone ought to tell him , thought Frances , that he ought to have said " Do you think so ? I 'm so glad " and left it to his guests to do the praising , if he really wanted to perfect his imitation . " You look very thoughtful , " he remarked . Frances came back to the room with a jolt . " Oh , I was thinking about forms of politeness . " " Now you have made me feel I must be very careful . I was n't very polite according to your standards , I am afraid , when we met at that Oxford party . Why did n't you tell me then that you were coming here ? " Richard entered the conversation . " Well , first of all , we thought you were in Berlin . And , secondly , it was pure chance that we did come here . We were at Mittenwald , you know , and then one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Tyrol . You know the sort of thing : you discuss some place , and then you feel you 'd like to go there , and then you go . " " Charmingly quixotic , " said von Aschenhausen . " And the most quixotic thing of all is that you should be Dr. Mespelbrunn , " Frances said . She felt his interest quicken . " I had imagined someone quite different , you know . " The tension was growing . " You see , I once read a book about Pertisau . It was called The Constant Nymph . So when we were buying some things in Anton 's shop , and he said that the chess connoisseur of the district was a Dr. Mespelbrunn , who just adored visiting chessmen , as it were , I suddenly thought Another Pertisau eccentric ; how amusing . ' He gave you a terrific build-up , you know , until I became quite intrigued . It was really I who am responsiblefor the visit , because Richard went all sort of diffident . Did n't want to trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expected to find a house filled with a remarkablefamily of chess experts and unrecognized geniuses , and here you are , a very comfortable bachelor . You 've really let me down , rather . I sha n't be able to romanticize again without Richard . . . well , just look at him . He is enjoying his joke , is n't he ? " Richard was indeed looking amused . " I 'd still like to see the collection , if I may , " he said . " I 'm afraid it is n't here at the moment . It 's being exhibitedat Innsbruck . " Von Aschenhausen looked as if he really were disappointed too . Or perhaps it was genuine : at the beginning of Frances ' little speech , he had hoped for something , something more than he had got by the end of it . He tried again . " I think you have been mistaken about me . I 've already apologized for our Oxford conversation . Ca n't you seep187there 's no other course for me ? Some types of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need strong aliases . " I lis meaning , accompanied by that shrug of the shoulder , that pained eyebrow , that so straight , so direct look into Frances ' eyes , could n't have been plainer . In another minute , thought Frances , he will start telling us anti-Nazi jokes , just to show us how mistaken we have been about him . She looked as if she believed him ; Richard nodded sympathetically ; but neither of them spoke . Von Aschenhausen waited . And then he began to ask about Oxford . His visit this summer had lasted only for a day ; he had had little time to find out all about his old friends . Frances could see where this line would lead him . So he was interested in Peter Galt , was he ? She left it to Richard to handle the conversation this time . She suddenlywanted to leave , but they could n't do that until von Aschenhausen was satisfied . She looked out of the window . Her thoughts turned to Mcspelbunn . Where was he ? Probably dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She watched the sunlight strike on the dark rich green of the fir trees , and the shadows lengthening on the hill . The afternoon was ending . She turned impatiently to the two men . Richard , by some feat , had switched the conversation over to the women 's colleges in Oxford , and there it had stuck , imbedded in the higher education of women . He refused to abandon his advantage ; he had got the conversation to a nice impersonal subject , and he was going to keep it there . He was politely defending the new freedom of women . Women had learned to compromise successfullybetween developing their mental powers and retainingtheir charm . The aggressive unfemininity of the orig- inal blue-stocking was already disappearing . It was only a matter of time and adjustment to a freer aspect of life . Von Aschenhausen smiled his disbelief . " They are too emotional . They are limited in reasoning power . They arc weaker , both physically and mentally . They can never be equal to men . Compromise , adjustment , matter of time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The use of Richard 's first name carried all three of them back , back to a time when suspicion and hatred had only brooded in the hearts of a few vengeful men . In the silence that followed , they looked at each other . There was no need to translate their thoughts into words ; they were clear in their eyes . The German spoke first . " You need not reproach me . What Mrs. Myles said at that sherry party was true . Oua countries have gone different ways . And I have my work to do . But I think , as I said already , that you have been mistaken about me . It is a compliment , I suppose , to my powers of acting . I never knew they were so good as that . " He shrugged his shoulders again and gave a rueful smile . You are not making a bad job of it , right now , thought Richard . Von Aschenhausen had been well cast for the part he had to play . To anyone who did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the authentic Mespelbrunn . Now , he was making the best of a very bad piece of luck : here were two people who could know that he was no Englishman . His hints at anti-Nazi feeling were just enough to win their sympathy , disarm their suspicions . He did n't protest too much , either ; he had to pretend that their visit was innocent , in case it really was . He could n't make any declarations ; he had to give them confidence , and perhaps they would show their hand once that was189established . His difficulty was that they might very well be only interested in chessmen . Considering everything which was at stake , he was not making a bad job of it at all , thought Richard again . Von Aschenhausen suddenly rose , and walked over to the small table which was used as a bar . His voice was charmingly ingenuous . " You used to play well . Why do n't you now , while I mix some drinks ? " As he measured out the whisky , Frances was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more than friendly interest . " Hello , " Richard said casually , " what 's this you 've got ? Do you sing ? " " Only for myself . You go ahead . " Richard noted the soprano setting of the song , and smiled gently . " It 's a good song , but not my cup of tea . What about The Two Grenadiers ' or something with hair on its chest ? I 'll need the music , though . I 'm very bad at playing things by ear . " He turned to a pile of music and started to look through it . Frances rose and went over to the piano . " You are both so modest . I 'll sing for you instead . " She saw Richard stiffen slightly , and give her a blank look . Von Aschenhausen was watching her now . She returned his smile sweetly and sat down on the piano stool . Richard cursed silently to himself ; surely Frances had not been duped by an earnest pair of blue eyes . Surely she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could only reach that little table and upset it by accident before she started to sing . . . But as he moved , the first notes sounded through the room , and the words of the song gathered strength as her voice grew more confident . Richard looked at von Aschenhausen . His politeness had vanished . The dueling scars on his face were very noticeable . Frances finished the last melancholy chords . She stood up and faced von Aschenhausen . She spoke directly to him . " It is called The Slaughter of the Innocents '  --  one of the old Coventry Carols . 1 ) o you know it ? " Her voice still held the sadness of the song , but there was a challenge in her eyes . " Sentimentalizing history , is n't it ? " His accent was less English . " Maybe . But it 's only when you think of history as blood and tears that you can ever learn from it . " She saw he understood the meaning underlying her words just as he had understood the application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought savagely . There was a sudden crash upstairs , and then the thuds of hollow blows . The noises ceased as startlingly as they had begun . Von Aschenhausen saw the surprise on their faces . He was suddenly casual and polite again ; he smiled easily . " Do n't worry , " he said . " That 's the dog . We keep him out of the way when we have visitors . He 's very savage with strangers . He is just about due for his exercise , and he always lets me know very forcibly when it 's time to take him out for a walk . " " Oh , we must n't keep you , then , " Frances said . " I am sure we have stayed too long , in any case . " " I am sorry I had to disappoint you about the chessmen . They may be back by Sunday . Come and see them , then . " Richard , still listening for further sounds , said theywould be delighted to come , perhaps at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was strange to keep an animal locked up inside a room upstairs ; that would hardly improve its temper . But of one thing he was certain : von Aschenhausen was determined to get them out of the house , as quickly as possible . Frances had already reached the door . As von Aschenhausenopened it for them , they heard two other sounds from upstairs . Weaker sounds , much weaker . But they ignored them , and said their good-bys as if nothing had happened . And they equally ignored the dark man with the hoarse voice , who stood astride outside the front door , his thumbs tucked inside his belt . At a nod directed upstairsfrom von Aschenhausen , he sprang quickly past them , mounting the steps three at a time . Von Aschenhausenhad regained his usual composure , but his smile was too fixed . He stood at the door and watched them until they had reached the trees . Frances hated the feeling of his eyes on her back ; she forced herself to walk naturally , as if she were strolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself what she had first known at a sherry party in Oxford . The man who had once been numbered among their friends had long since become an enemy . It was a painful admission . When they gained the road , Frances took a deep breath . " Well , I 've made another step in my education , " she said . Richard did not answer . Ile was lost in thought . " What 's wrong ? You have n't forgotten the Geneva address , have you ? Or what ? " Richard shook his head . He seemed to be paying little attention ; rather , he was watching the road as if he were trying to remember something.  | " It 's just about here , I think , " he said as if to himself . He saw Frances looking at him curiously . " Just about here , that the shoulder of the hill stopped hiding the house . We 'll give it another twenty yards . " The road twisted farther behind the jutting hill ; and as it passed through a fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep bank into the shelter of the branches . It was all so quick that Frances did not have time to say anything ; her surprise held her silent . Richard looked back over his shoulder , and then relaxed his grit . on her arm . " The shoulder hid us , and they could n't follow us yet . Not with the road so open as it is . " " What 's wrong ? " Frances asked again . " Something . Have n't quite made up my mind . " He advanced into the small wood , and Frances followed ; the feeling of confidence which had come to her as they left the path and reached the road quickly evaporated . Von Aschenhausen had discovered nothing , except that they did n't like the politics of his country  --  and that could n't have surprised him , even if it angered him . What worried Richard ? He had reached a large tree , which had sheltered the ground from the morning rain . There they regained their breath . It had only taken them two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown over a large mound , and from this elevation they had a clear view of one part of the road , neatly focused for them by the way in which the trees grew . They could see without being seen . Richard moved slightly to the left to get a better sight of the one visible patch of road . From this point , it could be seen even if they sat down . He seemed satisfied  --  but not with Frances '  |p193dress  . He pulled off the red silk handkerchief which she wore tucked into the neckline of her white shirt . " Put on your cardigan properly , " he advised , " and buttonit right up to cover that white collar . I do n't like the red socks : they shine up miles away . Here  --  " l Ic reached for a handful of earth mold , and covered the red wool with an efficient layer of clinging brown earth . " Here yourself , " said Frances with a good touch of annoyance . " My pet , you are n't in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He kept his voice low , but there was enough sharpness in it to tell her he was worried . " Well , I 'm glad that the cardigan is green , or I 'd be rollingin the mud at this moment , I suppose . . . What 's wrong ? " Richard put one arm round her shoulders , and kept his eyes fixed on the road . " Frances , what did you think when you heard the noises upstairs ? " So that was the trouble . She looked at him in surprise . " Well , it could have been a dog , " she said . " Forget about that dog . What were the noises like ? As you heard them , and not as they were explained away ? " Frances studied her muddied socks for some moments . She had been standing beside the piano ; the drinks they had n't touched had gleamed amber in a ray of sunlight . " Well , candidly , the first sound seemed a crash , as if something heavy , like a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came some thumps . " " Well ? " " They might have been a fist , but I do n't think any fist could have hammered loudly enough for us to hear , even allowing for wooden floors and ceilings . No , I do n't think those thumping sounds came from a fist . They were too powerful for that . I thought afterwards that it could have been a dog leaping against a heavy door . A big dog . " " But those thuds were clear-cut . They were sharply defined . There were no scrabbling noises , which generally end a dog 's jump against a door . Even when we were leaving , and we were standing at the foot of the staircase , there were no whines , no pawing sounds . Peculiar kind of dog it must have been . " Frances looked at Richard , who kept his eyes fixed on the road . She was beginning to see the reason for his worry . " Yes , " she agreed . " There were only clear-cut thuds . Sort of staccato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we heard at the bottom of the stairs , and which should have sounded clearer to us if anything , were actually weaker . " " Yes . " Something haunted her memory . " Wait , " she added . If only she could think what it was that had that kind of sound . Something she had heard that afternoon .. . in that room . " Richard  --  " her voice was excited now , and Richard laid a finger on his lips warningly  --  " Richard , if a dog jumped at the door as we are supposed to believe , the thud on the door would have a different sound from a thud on the floor , would n't it ? Well , do you remember when that bull-necked man left us to go and tell Mespelbrunn that we had arrived ? He swaggered across the floor and his heels made that same flat sound . The thumping was not against a door , it was on the ground . And I do n't believe it was made by anything so soft as a hand or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard . "  | " You are more right , still . Good for you , Fran . Now for a spot of reconstruction . We heard a crash , as if a piece of furniture or something solid had hit the ground . What about a chair ? And what about someone tied to the chair ? That would make the crash quite as heavy as we heard it . Then there were the thumpings , harder and stronger than the blows from a fist . ' What about two legs tied together ? Then they would have to be brought slowly up and allowed to fall on the floor . That would give the kind of noise we heard , all right ; for with the legs or ankles tied the heels would strike the ground together . It also accounts for the fact that the blows got weaker . It 's pretty difficult and tiring to attract anyone 's attention that way . " " But everything was so quiet in that house until those last five minutes . " " Yes , until after you had finished your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Richard nodded . " Yes . . . . He could n't have made out our voices when we were talking . And there would have been no hope for him if he had heard a German song sung by a German voice . But there was hope enough to try to attract our attention when he heard an English voice and a song which practically only an Englishman would recognize . " " So he may be our man ? What on earth can we do , Richard ? We 've found him and we have n't found him . " This was something which Peter Galt had not thought of ; they should have either met an Englishman , or found he was dead . Something nice and straightforward , and not a hopeless complication like this . " What 's our next step ? " she asked dismally . Richard drew a slab of chocolate from his pocket . " Eat some of this , " he suggested . He looked at his watch . " It 's well after five now . We had better wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize it . If no chance comes , I 'll take you back to Frau Schichtl 's , and come back here myself tonight . I 'd like to look around . " " You 've no gun , " said Frances in a very low voice ; her fears stifled her . " Perhaps he is n't our man after all , " she added persuadingly . " It 's some man , anyway . I 'd still like to look around . Henry may carry a gun . If so , I 'll borrow it . If not , then I 've always got my stick . " He patted the makhila which lay beside them . Frances looked at the Basque stick of rough wood , with its round leather handle and its sharply pointed ferrule . It did n't look much protection ; the iron point on the end was only good for helping you up a steep hill . Richard noticed her expression . He unscrewed the handle with a suspicion of a smile . " I never showed you this . It 's rather gruesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of it slipped off , and a wicked eight inches of pointed steel emerged . It was firmly fixed to the rest of the stick , and transformed it into an ominous weapon . " I 'm not really bloodthirsty , " he added . " I bought it on that Pyrenees trip , when I was an undergraduate , because I liked the way the Basques swung these sticks with the leather thong of the handle fixed round their wrists , when they were returning from market . Going to the town , they kept the cattle in order with the steel point . Coming from the town , they screwed the handle back in place and slipped the thong over their wrist , and swung it jauntily  --  with their jacket over one shoulder , and money in their pocket , and a smile for all the girls . I liked the contrast.  |p197Frances  looked at him incredulously . " And I 've looked at that stick for years , and I never . . . When you told Inc it was used for goading cattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stick which you meant . " She began to giggle ; any joke seemed doubly good at this moment . Richard 's smile broadened . " Really , Frances , you 're wonderful . Have you ever seen Basque oxen ? " He laughed quietly , and then kissed her . " I would n't part with you for all the gold in America , " he said . Frances recovered her seriousness . " Now that I 've suppliedthe comic relief , how long are we going to stay here , and what shall we do , if and when and where ? " " First of all , I was curious to see if we would be followed . We were n't , it seems . Von Aschenhausen perhaps was quite convinced that we were harmless fools . I should n't be surprised , though , if he checks up on our travels . You know the Teutonic thoroughness . That may have been the reason why he had that afterthought of invitingus to come back and see the chess collection : just so that he can know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably , too , someone will be sent to keep a watchful eye on us until we leave Pertisau . That 's very probable . That leads to my second idea . I 've been hoping that Beetlebrows might make one of his evening calls on Pertisau . If he does , then we 'll improvise . " " And I 'll be quite useless , " said Frances bitterly . " What you need is another man with you . And then we might be able to do something . " Richard did n't answer that . " If we could get to the house in a roundabout way , or something  --  " Frances went on  --  " but then we 'd have to face two men , armed , as well as the dog  --  if there is one . It would be madness . What you need is darkness , and someone like Henry or Bob , or both . And at least one gun . It 's hopeless . " " Let me do the worrying , Frances . I 'll try nothing unlessone of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily , if I can get to the house unseen . There is no telephone , and that will be useful for us : I 'm depending on Beetlebrows , and his visits to Pertisau . " He looked at his watch again . " It 's getting near his usual time . " Frances wondered why Richard was so confident that there were only two men to worry about . . . But his eyes were fixed on the road . She sat beside him and waited in silence . She felt she had made enough wifely objections to last for the next few hours . After all , she had insisted on coming . Richard had been against it . Wifely objections would only be doubly irritating . So she sat and finished the job of converting her red socks into a rich chestnutbrown.  |p199It  COULD only have been about ten minutes later when Richard 's arm tightened round Frances , and pushed her quickly flat on the ground . She felt a stone dig into the small of her back , but Richard 's grasp was firm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat on his stomach , his head only raised enough to let him see that free patch of road . It was the black-haired man , cycling towards Pertisau , with a wolf-hound at his heels . . . And then he was out of sight : the other trees hid him from Richard'sstraining eye . Richard relaxed his grip , and Frances sat up and rubbed her back . The stone had become a boulder . " So that leaves only von Aschenhausen , " said Richard with some satisfaction . Frances forgot her good resolutions . " I low are you so sure ? " she asked . " If there were others , then the noises upstairs would have been silenced more quickly . And von Aschenhausen had to signal to that man to stop guarding the front door . It was only then that he was free to go upstairs and attend to the noises . If there had been others to stop us from gettingaway  --  supposing it had come to that  --  then he would not have stuck outside until he got the signal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a small house , and if a group of men had arrived to live there , the villagers would have started to talk . Then any prospective visitors might have had suspicions aroused . I expect that black-haired fellow poses as Mespelbrunn 's new servant . " Richard looked at his watch , and then added , " We had better let him get halfway to Pertisau , and then he can look round as much as he likes and it wo n't troubleus . " " They have n't anything definite against us , have they ? " asked Frances . " Nothing except the fact that we were found in a suspectedshop in Niirnberg , and that we presented ourselves to an obviously suspected Dr. Mespelbrunn with a highly suspect form of introduction . They may dislike the coincidence . Perhaps von Aschenhausen has started to check up on us already . There is n't any phone , but he has some kind of radio transmitter and receiver , I 'm sure . Perhaps Beetlebrows is going down to Pertisau to keep an eye on us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be congratulating himself on getting rid of a pair of unwelcomevisitors , and Beetlebrows is cycling down to Pertisau to see a girl , or have his beer , or to keep his figure . I think myself that it 's safer to overestimate your enemies than underestimate them , so I 'm prepared to believe that they do n't like us one bit . " " Von Aschenhausen certainly did n't like me , " Frances said , and laughed gently . " I could have strangled you , myself , when you played that trick at the piano . You had me as jittery as he was . For a moment I thought you were going to play that damned music . " " Vas it as good as that ? Darling , you 've made me veryhappy . " " It was too dangerous , Frances . Never give in to your impulse for the artistic , not in a situation like that . " " Oh , it was safe enough . He thinks women have no brains . Even at the very end , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . " Richard smiled in spite of himself . . . . And then he looked at his watch impatiently , and then he looked at the warm glow of the evening sun . " I wish it were darker , but we ca n't wait . Come on , Frances . " They made their way back to the road , and paused at the edge of the trees . There was no one in sight . They crossed quickly into the rough field which stretched towards the stream , skirting the foot of the hill . They coveredthe uneven ground quickly but carefully . " No twisted ankles at this point , " said Richard . Frances nodded . She was concentrating on the varying firmness of the treacherous clumps underneath her feet . The stream was shallow , fortunately . They crossed by choosing stones either jutting up or only lightly covered by the racing water . Frances congratulated herself on having her shoes only wet , and not swamped entirely . And now they began to climb the hill itself , aiming for a point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . This side of the hill was dangerously open ; there were no trees , only grass and shrubs which ultimately gave way to the rocky spine . Again Frances had the feeling that the hill which they were climbing was the buttress , and the mountain behind it was the cathedral . It was like a finger pointing out of the mountain 's clenched hand . The climb was more difficult than it looked from the road , for there was no path to lead them over the easiest ground.  | Two thirds of the climb found the undergrowth thinningout quickly . They paused for breath , while Richard scanned the ground above them . He shook his head as he noticed the increasing number of small screes . It was madnessto try to scramble over their treacherous surface ; the stones now under their feet were as knife-sharp as when they had been splintered from smashing boulders . The ridge of the hill was of rock , and , at this distance , there was a dangerous look to the last fifty feet . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to the place where the hill joined the mountain . Just at that point there seemed to be a slight hollow . It was the bed of a mountain stream , now dry , but no doubt forming a gleaming cascade of water in the spring . " Our best bet is to strike for the stream , " he said . " It will take us farther away from the house , but the dry bed of a torrent is easier than a miniature precipice . " He pointed to the crest of the hill . Frances needed no convincing . They began to climb obliquely up towards the bed of the stream , avoiding any falls of loose gravel , and choosing ground where some persistent green still showed . That at least gave them some guarantee of safety . It was slow work , until they suddenly met , to Frances ' joy , a small track which had the same idea as Richard . It must have begun at the road , near the place where the shoulder of the hill had formed a jutting curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder 's crest . " We could have followed this all the way , " said Frances , with some exasperation , following their own course up the hill with a bitter eye . " No , it began too close to the house . The road at thatp203point might have been watched by Herr Von-und-zu strolling in his nice soft meadow . " Frances was standing very still . " Well , we only postponedit , " she said so quietly that Richard stopped and turned to see her face . " Down there , " she added . Richard followed the direction of her eyes . The valley beneath them was no longer empty . Along the road which led from Pertisau a man was riding a bicycle . " Like the hammers of hell , " Richard said , and swore gently but wholeheartedly . " Do n't move . Keep just the way you are . " " He looks like an ant , " said Frances . " Louse , you mean . " Richard was worried . " I wonder now . . . what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate ? No one there knew when we were returning , except Henry or Bob ; and he ca n't have been talking to them . " " I wonder if he saw us . Do you think the would take me for another piece of greenery ? There are at least two pieces of scrub near me . " She looked fearfully at her socks , but the loam had been reinforced by some mud which she had blundered into on the soft bank of the stream . Richardwatched the cyclist as he reached the curve in the road . " He has n't slackened pace yet ; it looks as if he might not have noticed us . If he had , I should think he would have slowed up , just to make sure . God , that dog can keep up a terrific clip . " " What shall we do ? " " There 's still daylight for some time , " Richard said thoughtfully . " Once we are up there , we ought to have a wonderful view of the back of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in Pertisau , and come by myself . " " Then you would n't have had either an old English song , or these noises . Let 's go on , Richard . I do n't like the idea of going down the way we came up . And once we get up  --  we are very nearly there anyway  --  we might find a decent path on the mountain itself to lead us back to Pertisau . There 's no law against us trying to climb our way back towards the village and if anyone wants to know why we took so long , well then , we got lost . That 's all . " But the truth was , she added to herself , that Richard would have gone on if he had been alone or with another man  --  and that settled it . Richard still looked doubtful , but he was wavering . " Well , we can watch from the top for half an hour , and if it all seems hopeless , then I 'll get you back to the road before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move , Richard . " They started to climb the last stretch of hill . The path was apologetic . At best , it was little more than a foot broad ; at its worst , it effaced itself altogether under slides of stones . As they crossed these slowly , Frances held her breath . One slip here , and she would go rumplin ' tuinplin ' down the Tankersha ' brae . She kept her eyes fixed on the next step ahead , and avoided looking down to her right . For there the hill now fell steeply away , carved out by erosion into an adequate quarry . If this path had lain across a field , you could run along it , she argued . So there was no reason why she could n't walk along it here , providedshe did n't know how far she had to fall . And then the green scrub was again growing thickly , and they had reached the bushes and dwarf trees which edged the bed ofP205the stream . The sides of the dry torrent , and even the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a staircase . A giant 's staircase , thought Frances , but at least if she slipped here she would always have a boulder behind her , to block her fall . They were both breathing heavily with the effort of hoisting themselves over the rocks which would form the bank of the torrent when the snows melted in the spring . But the worst of the climb was already past . The boulders in the bleached bed of the stream were thinning out , and the ground was leveling . They were approaching the saddlebetween the hill and the mountain . As it opened out before them they saw that it was broad and gently sloping . They left the stream which was turning towards the mountain itself , and walked quickly over the grass towards some scattered rocks on the saddle 's crest . From there they could see the valley with the red-shuttered house . When they reached the rocks only half of their expectations was realized . All they could sec of the house was some blue smoke which curled up lazily over the tops of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm afraid . It seems I dragged you up here to admire the view , Frances . I 'm sorry . " Frances let her muscles relax . She pushed her damp hair away from her brow to feel the full coolness of the evening breeze . " You can always study the paths , " she said . Richard was already doing that . The saddle seemed the meeting place of the paths on the hill and the mountain . If he could get Frances back to Pertisau as quickly as possible , and if the moon was as clear as it had been last night ,  |p206then  he could use the mountain paths to bring him right up behind the house . He could sec both of them clearly from here ; neither was difficult . Eastwards towards Pertisau stretched the first path he would use , which would bring him easily onto this saddle ; and then , from here , there was a westward path , cutting across the mountain where it formed a background for the house . He could see at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the house . Then he might try some stalking right up to the outskirts of the house itself . Thornley would he a good man to have along ; he knew his way about a mountain . It was just as well that he had come up here after all . Ile looked at the mountain paths , and photographedwhat he saw in his memory . Frances , lying beside him , her chin cupped in her hands , had been staring at the forest beneath them . Her eyes followed the well-marked path , which led from the saddle down through the trees towards the house . This was probably the path which began at the bridge in the valley . She looked at the trees , as if by sheer will-power she might see through them , through the walls of the house itself into that room upstairs . She was comparing her reactions as she had left that house to those of Richard , and the result did not flatter her . She had taken it for granted that their job was over , that there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and enjoy themselves . She had believed the story about the dog because she had wanted to believe it ; it was a subconscious desire to be rid of complications , to avoid any further trouble . Now she knew that she would n't have been able to enjoy any holiday . She would have had to face the fact ultimately that it had n't been a dog , and she would have rememberedp207it just as long as she would remember the cry in a Jews ' Alley in Nurnberg . She suddenly stiffened . " What was that ? Richard , I saw something down there . " " Where ? " He turned to look down the hill towards the house . The path , beginning near where they lay , twisted its way towards the forest . Beyond the last trees , the smoke curled from the chimney . " Down there . Look . The twist in the path hid it . . . near the trees . Richard , it 's a dog . " Richard grasped her wrist and the strength of his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . The dog , bounding up the path towards them , had stopped and was looking backwards . When the two men came in sight , he again bounded on . It was von Aschenhausen and the black-haired man . The path was broad enough to let them walk abreast . They carriedno sticks , but their hands were deep in their jacket pockets . Their eyes searched the hill around them . Once they stopped , while the man looked towards the westward path on the mountain , but it had only been some animal which had attracted his attention . I lc had quick eyes all right , thought Richard . " Keep cool , Frances . They have n't seen us yet . " Again the men stopped , and this time they separated . Von Aschenhausen left the path , and began to climb directlyup the shoulder . His pace had slowed down , but even from that distance it was evident that he could climb . When von Aschenhausen reached the top , he would be just about the place which they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the eastp208side of the shoulder , which the German would then have to descend , would cramp his style a little . His plan was to encircle them , obviously . The black-haired man was ploddingsteadily up the path to the saddle where they lay ; the dog bounded ahead . As they backed cautiously from the sheltering rocks , and raced back over the gently sloping ground , Richard was thinking quickly but nonetheless clearly . Von Aschenhausenhad taken the much more difficult way because his companion was probably a less expert climber . So much the better for Frances and himself . He would rather face brawn than brain , any day . You could outwit the former . They must make for the bed of the stream ; that was their only hope for cover . Once they were hidden by the bouldersand the bushes which twisted round them on the torrent 's banks , they could follow the bed until they had reached the fields and the woods round the Pletzach  --  and then they would be safe enough . The incriminating thing for them would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If von Aschenhausen did n't find them on the hill , they could find an explanation for their late return to Pertisau . And he would have to accept it , because he would n't be able to disprove it . But it all made tonight 's plans almost impossible . They would be closely watched from now on . If Frances had been thankful for grass under her feet when she had first reached the saddle on the way up , she now almost wept with relief . She could run swiftly on this surface and , what was just as important , run silently . She had the feeling of desperate effort which she used to have as a child when she played Cowboys-and-Indians and she was one of the chased . It was no longer a game , but thep209old terrifying feeling of strained muscles bogging her down , of feet sticking to the ground , was still there . She must go faster and faster , but her body refused even as her mind urged her on . She sagged , her heart pounding and a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Richard 's hand , which had not loosened its grasp on her wrist from the moment when they had first seen the dog , pulled her up and on . They had reached the stream . Their run had slowed down to a scramble , but the first large rocks were near them . Richard had let go of her wrist now ; they needed the use of their hands to steady themselves through the boulders . It would have been quicker work if they had n't had to avoid any clatter of stones . Richard was thankful for what he had been cursing only half an hour ago , for the fact that they had worn rubber-soled shoes today to go visiting , rather than their nail-studded climbing boots . The man could not have reached the top of the path yet ; nor could von Aschenhausen have reached the crest of the shoulder . As the stream bed plunged deeply in between the crags , Richard looked over his shoulder . They were hidden now , thank God , from both the shoulder and the saddle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was the dog . It had marked them from the saddle , and instead of waiting there for the dark-haired man , had followedthem . It had n't barked . There was something uncannyin the silent way it calculated its powerful leaps over the rough stones , to alight on smooth rock . Its speed was checked by its twists and turns , by the way in which its thick haunches would brake suddenly on the steep side of a boulder . But its direction was unerring . P210Richard hurried Frances on . They had passed the point where the track on the side of the hill had met the stream , and they were on strange ground now . The bed plunged still deeper , the banks were rockier , and more thickly screened by small wiry mountain trees . Their speed increasedagain , for the bed was less cluttered with boulders . The stones under their feet were sharp and uneven ; those stones would hold up the dog , anyway . And then the stream curved round a mass of rock , and they saw that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was nothing but space , and the precipice over which the torrents would pour in the spring , falling in a series of cataracts to the valley beneath . They looked at each other , trying to hide the dismay in their hearts . To their left was the open mountain rising steeply ; to their right , over the high bank with its crags and bushes , lay the landslide which Frances had called a quarry . They were neatly trapped . Frances backed away from the edge of the precipice instinctively . Richard stood , his eyes turned towards the mountain , looking for some short-cut up to that eastwardboundpath which would lead them to Pertisau . The ground was open , and there was little cover , but if the man had followed the dog into the bed of the stream , his view of the mountainside would be blocked by the height of the banks long enough to let them reach that point in the path where there were some trees and scrub . Anyway , there was no other choice . And then , behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had followed the boulders on the banks of the stream , and now it was poised above them , eyes gleaming , teeth showing wickedly . Even as they had turned , it gath/c red its muscles to spring . Frances was the nearer . She heard Richard 's voice behind her , low , urgent . " Down ! On your face ! " She was hypnotized as the animal , now more wolf than dog , hurled its huge weight down at her . She heard the snarl , saw the teeth ready to tear . Her eyes closed involuntarilyas the slavering jaws aimed at the level of her throat , and she dropped on the ground . She felt it pass above her body , striking something beyond . Richard .. . Richard . . . That sound , what was that sound ? She raised herself on an elbow , afraid to turn her head , afraid to see . Just behind her , so that she could have touched it with her foot , lay the dog . Its throat was spitted on the steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face white , his hands still braced on the stick 's shaft . The force of the dog 's leap had knocked him backwards . I le tried to shake the animal 's body free from the stick , but the eight inches of steel were firmly embedded . With a grimace of disgust , he put his foot on the dog 's chest , and pulled the stick as if it were a bayonet . It came out slowly . From farther up the bed of the stream had come the rattle of stones , as if a heavy man had slipped badly . Richard pointed to the bank on the mountain side of the gorge . Frances rose , and moved with difficulty towards the protection of its rocks . The man would not see them until he had got well round the bend , and then he would see the dog first . There was no time to hide it , even if they could have brought themselves to touch its dead body . Richard followed her , the stick still blood-covered . He should have wiped it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't . He felt sicker than he liked to admit . " Through there , " he whispered , pointing between two boulders . Frances obeyed , keeping her head and shoulders low . By using the uneven rocks and the thick bushes for cover , they managed to clear the stream 's high bank . The man in the stream bed would not see them , because of the twist in its course . Von Aschenhauscn , now probably over the shoulder , might be on the difficult track which had led them to the stream . It had taken them a good fifteen minutes . It would take him as long ; there was no easy way . They paused for a moment . Behind them lay the bank ; in front of them was the mountainside , its slope covered with scrub which would hardly reach their knees . They heard the man 's steps now , in the bed of the stream . He would just be coming round the bend now . The footsteps paused , and then quickened . So he had seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering if they should stay quietly where they were , hidden by the boulders ... . And then he remembered . The bloodstains . They had laid a pretty track . " Go on , " he whispered to Frances . She looked at him despairingly . " I ca n't lead . You must . I 'll go over the side . " She pointed to the steep drop down to her right . The landslide which had created the quarry and the cataract behind them had done its work here too . The shoulder met the mountain with a spectacular precipice . Their only hope was to keep away from the treacherous edge and work up towards the mountain path as quickly as possible . Richard had already moved ahead . There were no more blood drops from the stick . If they reached the shelter of that boulder ahead before the man could follow their trail through the rocks on the bank , they could take cover there . If he did n't see them , it was possible that he would n't startp213to search this nasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way impassable and that they had doubled on their tracks upstream again . Judging from the noise the man had made as he had come down the bed , he was not much accustomed to climbing . That was some- ! ling to be thankful for . Richard moved quickly and carefully , conscious that t Ile ground sloped on his right towards the precipice . The boulder he had picked out as a refuge lay farther up the hill , farther away from the edge . That would cheer up Frances . And then it was that he became aware that her footsteps were not following ; or was it possible that anyone could walk so quietly as that ? He turned slowly , carefullybalancing his weight . Frances stood almost where he had left her . She had moved up the hill slightly , back t swards the rocks . She was standing quite still , her body pressed against one of them . That damned precipice , he thought , and started despairingly back towards her . But she shook her head and waved him towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing laboriously , the leather soles of his boots slipping on the stony surface . She moved slowly up behind the rock to which she had been clinging , avoiding the large stones which were loose to her touch . The fear , which had paralyzed her legs so that she could n't follow Richard , suddenly left her . All she felt now was anxiety for him . She pointed frantically towards the boulder ; but he did n't or would n't understand . He was coining back to her . The man was almost over the bank . Like them , he had chosen to keep in cover . Perhaps he thought they were armed , and was taking no chance of silhouetting himself against the sky . He would come out down there , just where they had emerged from the bank , for it was the easiest way through , but although she had followed his progress with her ears , it was a shock suddenly to see him there , only ten feet away . He had n't looked up towards where she remainedmotionless behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ; his eyes were fixed on Richard . He pulled out his revolver . It was a large , efficient-looking black one . Then , as he saw clearly that Richard was unarmed , he stepped forward out of cover . If he had expected Richard to throw ( himself on the ground , or to turn and run , he was disappointed . The two men stood scarcely twenty yards apart , looking at each other . There was a smile on the man 's face . IIc was like a cat playing with a mouse . He lifted the revolver slowly , slowly . Frances raised the heavy stone which she had gathered in her two hands and threw it with all her strength from above her head . It caught him between the shoulder blades , and sent him staggering forward . Frances saw him make a frenzied effort to regain his balance , half-turning towards her as he fell . Even then , he would have been safe if he had braked with his elbows and dug in his feet . But he had only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden movement cost him his one chance . She saw the rock splinter beside her , and then heard the crash of the revolver . It was then that he realized his own danger . Frances , crouching at the side of the rock , saw the expression of hate on the man 's face give way to fear . She saw him drop the Luger , his hands claw the ground , too late . There was nothing on the sloping edge to grasp except loose stones . He was clutchingone in each hand as he slipped over the precipice . His scream fell with his body . It was Richard who stood beside her , trying to loosenP215her grip on the rock . He put his arm round her waist and helped her up the sloping ground , back towards the stream . They had followed the sheltering bank almost to the flat ground of the saddle before Frances realized they had retracedtheir path . " Richard , " she said , " I 'm going to be awfully sick . " " Darling , try not to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be almost at the stream by this time . He must have heard the shot and the scream . " She passed a hand wearily over her white face . Her voice was flat . " I forgot about him . Do you think he has seen us ? " " I hope not . We 've kept under the shelter of the bank all the way up , and we are on the mountain side of the stream , while he is , or was , on the shoulder side . Anyway , he will have plenty to occupy his attention down there . It will be quite a job looking for his boy friend . He will probably think we headed for the path on the mountain . It is n't likely that he would guess we are going to use his own path down to his house . " " Richard ! " " Yes , we are . It 's quite the safest way down . I do n't like the idea of the mountain path now that the sun is almost gone . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light had turned a cold-gray . Ahead of them was the only glow in the sky , where the setting sun colored the clouds . " Keep low , " Richard warned , " as we go across the saddle . And watch the sky line . " They broke into a crouching run as they crossed the grass , and when they approached the top of the saddle , they used the boulders to black-out their outlines to any watcher beneath them . They crossed the top by lying flat on the ground and edging their bodies carefullyover . When they had reached the western side of the rocks , behind which they had lain this afternoon and looked down into the valley , Richard stood up and helped Frances to her feet . Normally , he thought , she would have giggled at the ludicrous figures they must have made in the last ten minutes . She would have had some joke to make about the rips on her clothes , the bruises and scratches on her legs . But she said nothing , only faced him with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they were cold , like marble . I lc pulled out his flask of brandy . " It 's safe enough on this path , " he said . " Take a good swig , Frances . " She took it obediently , and handed the flask back in surprise . " Not even a cough or a splutter , " she said in amazement . Richard 's anxiety lessened . It was a good thing if she had started noticing her reactions . " Got your wind ? " She nodded . " I 'm all right . " The brandy had warmed her , and the sickness was gone . " Well , I 'll let you do what you 've always wanted to do  --  I 'll let you run down a hill . " She was almost smiling . He caught her in his arms and hugged her . And then they were running , carefully but steadily , down the broad path . Richard kept to the outside , holding her right hand as they ran . Their speed increased when they reached the darkening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine needles . It twisted through the trees in zigzag curves , and these they shortened by slipping and sliding down the dry earth of the banks . The wood was already asleep . There were no sounds except the muffled pad of their feet , the occasional snap of a dry twig ,  |p217the  heaviness of their breathing . The trees were thinning , there was a little more light , and they were passing the edge of the meadow and the track which led to the house . Down there , in front of them , were the bridge and the road itself . Then Richard caught Frances tightly . Through the quickly falling dusk they could see a car on the roadway , and the men talking beside it. " 0 God , " said Richard . Frances looked at him in surprise . " What 's wrong , Richard ? Do n't you see who they are ? It 's an American car . " She was right . They started forward again . The two men looked as if they were getting into the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halted , and turned round in amazement . And then they ran over the bridge to meet them . " Well , I 'll be  --  " began van Cortlandt , and then stopped as he looked at them . Richard pushed Frances into his arms . " Get her into the car , and look after her . Park off the road , and not where it can be seen from the house . Keep the lights off . Be ready to start at a moment 's notice . Need your help , Bob . Are you game ? " Thornley took his eyes off Frances ' face and the cut on her shoulder where her ripped cardigan and blouse showed blood . He nodded . " I 'm ready , " he said , and moved off after Richard . Van Cortlandt watched them go towards the dark house . " Now just what 's this all about ? " he said . Frances tried to smile . " I sang and we heard noises and they said it was a dog . "  | Her voice was low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and carried her to the car . He moved the car as Richard had said , and then turned to look at the girl beside him . She had n't fainted ; she had just collapsed . . . Pretty thoroughly , too . There were tears running down her cheeks . " I have n't got a hankie . I lost it , " she said in a muffled voice . He looked at her torn clothes . " I 'm not surprised , " he said , and handed her the neatly folded one he kept in his breast pocket . " Try this . " Frances saw his concern . " I 'm all right , really . All I need is a good cry . " " Well , go ahead , " he said . " I 've another handkerchief in my hip pocket . They are all yours . " He was rewarded with a weak smile . " I can talk , now , " she said at last . " I do n't suppose youhave anything I could eat ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could give you a drink , though . " " I 've had one . Candy will do , beautifully . " He watched her curiously as she ate the bar of chocolate . " You can tell me as much or as little as you like , " van Cortlandt said . " I 'll not use it . " Frances looked at his firm mouth and worried eyebrows . " I know , Henry . I suppose it 's only fair to let you know what 's happening , seeing that you are partly mixed up with it now , anyway . Do you mind if I eat while I talk ? " Van Cortlandt restrained his grin . These people , really .. . There , he was catching it from them . Lost it , she had said apologetically , when she looked as if she had almost lost everything else , including her life . Eat while I talk , do you mind ?  | " Remember , not a word of this to anyone . Not until we arc all safely out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right word . " Dynamite ? " She gave her first real smile . " Yes , dynamite . " She tried to get the things she would say into the right order . Her story was slow and halting . She began with the visit that afternoon to the Englishman who was no Englishman . Van Cortlandt listened attentively and patiently , his eyes trying to see her face in the darkness . He did n't miss the pauses , when she would struggle for words and the story would take a leap forward . She was near the end of it now . There was a note in her voice which held him silent through the long hesitations between the phrases. .. and missed . . . and fell . . . over a precipice . We climbed back on our tracks and crawled and ran and then we saw you . " " And what about the German whom you knew ? " " I suppose he would try to trace the other . Ile must have heard the shot , and the scream . " She stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were signs of the fall , you know , where the stones slipped . " Van Cortlandt whistled . " Well , " he said , " that was quite an afternoon you had yourselves . " Frances said nothing to that . She tried to see out of the car , but it was almost dark . " I wonder why they are so long ? " she said . " Do n't worry ; they can take care of themselves , " but his face was less confident than his words . " I could kick myself , " he added . " I 'm the big mouth who gave you away . " Frances looked at him in amazement . " You know , I have n't asked you how on earth you got here . You should be in Innsbruck , and Bob , too . I was so glad to see you , I forgot to ask . " " Well , it was like this . Bob saw you start off , and when you did n't get back before six as you had promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forgotten : you were sort of vague about it . But he just shook his head gloomily and said he was going to wait . So we hung about , and then that black-haired guy arrived on his bicycle . I was standing at the hotel door  --  Bob was somewhere inside  --  and he had a look at our suitcases and the car . Just then the hotel man came out , and stopped to speak to me . He said we were late . I said yes . I Ic said was there anything wrong ? And I said you had n't got back yet . At that , the black-haired chap got onto his bicycle and went over to Frau Schichtl 's . I did n't like that . And I liked it less when he must have found out you were n't there , because he shot past us and went right back in the direction he had come from , with the dog just behind him . " I had the sense to ask who he was . The hotel man shrugged his shoulders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then Bob came out , and he and I had some beer , and we talked it over . And the later it became , the worse we liked it . We went to see Frau Schichtl , and we worried her too . But anyway she could tell us the quickest way to get to the house . That worried Bob still more , because it was the road you had taken that afternoon . Then we thought we would go see for ourselves . Bob said you had n't been prepared for a long walk or climb when you left the village ; he had noticed you were n't wearing your boots , and that clinched the argument . We thought we would ask at the house and find out if anyone had seen you ;  |p221we  were both hoping that perhaps you had tried a short-cut home and had sprained an ankle or something . " Well , we got to the house , and we knocked loudly enough , but we got no answer . Silent as the tomb . We were talking about what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave , when we heard Richard . " " Thank Heaven for that , " said Frances quietly . They were both silent . " I 'm tired , " said Frances suddenly , and he saw her eyes close . He reached for the rug and wrapped it round her , and pillowed her head more comfortably against the back of the seat . She was already asleep . He strained his eyes through the darkness , but he could only see the outlines of the bushes and trees . He could hear nothing , except the gentle breathing of the girl beside him . Poor kid , he thought . What was that Gilbert and Sullivan thing ? " Here 's a how d' you do . . . " It was all that , and more . Expect the worst , and you wo n't be disappointed , he told himself . He slipped some guns into his mouth , and settled down to wait , with his gloomy speculations for company . What interested him most in Frances ' story was the omissions.  |p222As  RICHARD AND BOB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abbreviated version of what had happened . Like Frances , he was careful to be vague about Mespelbrunn , but his account of the way she had saved him on the mountainside was included . Thornley listened in silence , and then as Richard finished speaking in the low voice which was almost a whisper , said , " Pity you did n't get the other blighter , too . " The house was just as van Cortlandt had described it to Frances . Silent as the tomb . They tried the front door and windows . As they expected , they were locked . The back door was locked , too . " Goes to bed early , " whispered Richard . " Who ? " " The maid . Or else she was packed off home . " " Ca n't risk breaking a window , then ? " " No , she may be asleep in her room , " Richard said . He pointed to a window . " That may be our room . Can you climb ? " Thornley looked at the balcony at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easy meat , " he said softly . He swung himself up easily from a windowsill . He had a professional way of feeling for a hold and using his feet . Richard wondered if he were one of the Cambridge roof climbers . In that case , it wasP223easy meat . Thornley had hold of the balcony now ; he pulled the rest of his body up slowly until he could swing a leg over the railing . The whole thing looked so simple that one would hardly have guessed the strain on his arms and shoulders . He disappeared silently over the edge of the balcony . Richard kept close to the shadow of the house . Above him , he heard a shutter being tried . Then there was a shadow on the balcony , and a whisper . " Barred and bolted . Hopeless . I 'll try another room . " The shadow vanished . Richard waited . The minutes seemed like hours . He thought he had heard a shutter being forced open . . . . And that sound might be a window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb up himself , even with his stiff shoulder and torn knees . What the devil was keeping Bob ? Just as he was trying to think of the easiest way to get up , he heard Thornley 's voice in a whisper above him . " Here . Lend us a hand . " 1 Tc was supporting another man . Richard watched Thornley help the man over the railing , and then lower him , holding on to the man 's wrists . Richard braced himself to take the man 's weight as he dropped . " Right , " he whispered . Thornley , half over the railing , grunted , and let go of the man 's wrists . Richard caught him by the thighs as he fell , and they rolled over together on the grass . Thornley swung himself lightly down beside them , and helped them to their feet . " Winded ? " he asked the man . " All right , thanks . Neat job . " He stood up shakily , and looked from Thornley to Richard . " Who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , " Richard said.  | The man turned to Thornley . " There 's a summerhouse at the edge of the wood , beside two tall trees hiding a mast . " Thornley looked towards where the man pointed , and nodded . The man went on , " There 's a wireless set there , and a motor bicycle . Can you put them out of action ? " " We 'll start for the car , " said Richard , as Thornley grinned and turned to sprint for the summerhouse . He put the man 's arm round his shoulder , and held him at the waist ; together they walked slowly towards the path . The man might have been thirty or fifty ; he was one of those bird-faced Englishmen whose age it was difficult to guess . I le was of medium height and thin . His hair was mouse-colored ; his eyes were nondescript . His voice had no marked accent . " Why were you here this afternoon ? " " We were directed to Mespelbrunn from Innsbruck . " " And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for . " " Who are the we ' ? " " My wife and myself . " " You look as if you had met trouble . " " Complications . I left my wife in the car . " " You 've a car ? Good . " " And an American : a reporter . " " Not so good . " " He 's a decent sort . We can trust him . " The man shook his head and cracked a smile . " Trust no newspaperman ; they 've an itch for a story . If he asks questions , I 'm Smith , who helped escapes from concentration camps . That 's true , anyway . Who 's the other , our blond Tarzan ? " " I know his brother . "   " I 'll be Smith for him too . " They had reached the fringe of trees . There was no sound of running footsteps from the wood above them . There was still some safety , yet , thought Richard . llc wished Thornley would come . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling ? " he asked . " Shaky and stiff . But better every moment . Good to be free again . " " How did they get you ? " " The man who posed as Mespelbrunn was supposed to be in sympathy with the underground movement . He even helped some escapes . Got at me through them . How were Nurnberg and Innsbruck , by the way ? " " Nurnberg had to make a run for it . Innsbruck was gettingsuspicious about something . " They paused while Richard changed his hold on the man ; the steepness of the path was a strain . " And just what happened to my two bodyguards ? " " They chased us on the hills . Von Aschenhausen is probably coming back now . The other fell over a cliff . " " Too bad , " Smith said , and looked at sonic burns on the palms of his hands . " And the dog ? " " Very dead . " Smith 's face relaxed slightly . " You 've been busy . " When they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also the bicycle , itself , " he reported . " 1 buckled its wheels . Strangely enough , it took the longest time . " Richard looked up towards the darkness which was the forest and the hill ; they were both now indistinguishable . They were probably safe  --  probably.  | " Could you run , if we both helped ? " he asked Smith . " I can try . " They linked arms round him , and half ran , half swept him along the road . Van Cortlandt had heard them . He had the engine running , and the back door of the car open for them , by the time they reached him . They thrust Smith into the car , and stumbled after him . Richard heard the man draw his breath in sharply when his body was thrown into the corner of the car as it jerked onto the road , and began the rough journey hack to Pertisau . But even if he was hurt , he was safe . Richard leaned over to look at Frances . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . The American answered without turning his head . " Surprising . She 'll be all right when she wakens . Best thing for her . " Richard relaxed , and leaned back against the seat , taking care not to jolt against Smith . Thornley suddenly gave a laugh . " I have n't had so much fun for a long time , " he said . " I 'm glad someone enjoyed himself , " Richard said . " What happened upstairs , by the way ? " " The window you pointed out was barred and bolted like nothing I ever saw in a private house . So I tried the next room , and the shutter there was only latched in the usual way . I used my knife , and got it , and then the window , open . The light was pretty bad ; I just could see dimly . A sort of man 's bedroom it was , with a desk at the window . There was a lot of stuff on top of it . I was hoping I might find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found this . " P227He held up something in the darkness of the car . " Electric torch . Damned useful , too . It was black as pitch in the corridor outside , and in the room where I found your friend . They had tied him up again . " " And very welcome you were , " said Smith . He was rubbing his wrists and ankles with his knuckles . He did n't use the palms of his hands . " Were you always tied up ? " asked Richard . " Always when any visitor was seen approaching the house . And then , I was gagged too , like this afternoon . During the nights , I was handcuffed to the bed . In the daytimethere was always one of them on guard . They also had fixed bars onto the window . On the door they had put safety chains . They used to leave it just a chink open that way through the day , so that I 'd feel someone was always watching me . " " It made things quicker for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door was the usual type ; after that there were just a couple of those chains and a heavy bolt . They did n't expect you to be reached from the outside . " " I 'm glad you were still alive , " Richard said . " They just did n't want me alone . There was a lot of informationthey thought I could give them . I could n't give it if I were dead . " " Judging from the time they kept you , they did n't get very much . " Smith gave a bitter smile . " Nothing of any use . Every now and again I 'd pretend I was weakening ; that encouraged them to keep me alive for just another few days . And then , they 'd like to confront me with anyone who had come looking for me , and had been trapped . They like drama , these chaps , you know . Faked confessions and all that . They got a man from London , and two poor devils from Germany . Von Aschenhausen did the talking , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What about the maid ? " " Oh , old Trudi . . . She was terrified . When they took over , she just had to go on serving them as if nothing had happened . Threats against her family . You know . They locked her up in her room at night , which was quite needlessof them . She was much too frightened to have done a thing for me . It is extraordinary the amount of power you can get over certain types of people if you just terrify them enough . " They were coming to the village . Smith leaned forward . " Keep to the dark roads , and away from that inn where they are dancing . Keep well over to your left . Just grass , anyway . " They saw the lights round the platform outside the inn . Through the trees came the sound of a polkalike tune . They bumped over grass , as Smith had said , and then they were on a narrow graveled road which led towards the scattered lights at the shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung south , running silently and smoothly along a track which would take them behind the string of hotels on the lakeside . Smith had taken charge ; his voice was still as cool and impersonal as when Richard had first met him . " What were your last actions when you left here ? " " Van Cortlandt and Thornley were leaving by car ; my wife and I were going for a walk . " Smith spoke to the American . " You 've paid your bill , got your luggage , and actually left ? " " All here , Captain , " van Cortlandt said.  | " Good . You can stay out of the picture , then . " Ile turned to Richard . " You and your wife had better leave the car at a safe distance from your hotel . Or perhaps it would be better if you went alone . Can you remember the things she 'll need ? Do n't forget her make-up box , especially the mascara . Bring something for me , too . And money . Is there more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip out without being seen ? " " We are staying in a house . I think we could both go . Quicker if there were two of us . " Smith nodded . " Much . If you think you could slip away without being spotted . With ordinary luck , we have got about an hour 's start . We 'll take the car to the south end of the shore road . There are some trees and a good stretch of grass just off the road near the last hotel . We 'll wait there . The moon wo n't be up for a while . " Richard had been shaking Frances gently . She sat up and looked round her in a bewildered way . " So am I , " said van Cortlandt good-humoredly . " You go with Richard . We 'll wait for you . Good luck to both of you . " " Thanks , " said Richard . " We 'll need it . " The car was slowing down . Henry was no fool , thought Richard . He had halted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing dark and silent with its shutters tightly fastened . He slipped out of the car into the blackness . Van Cortlandt helped Frances into his hands . He put his arm around her , and walked her over the grass . Behind them , they heard the car move smoothly away . Waldesruhe lay just ahead . There was a light at the back of it . That would be the kitchen . The hotels around it were silent . There were lights in the bedrooms , as if most of the visitors were going to bed . Those who were going to the dance must have already set out , for the road was empty . There was the usual weak light in the downstairs sitting room of the house . It lighted the bottom steps of the staircase . Farther up , Frances stumbled in the half darkness , and they halted , but they heard no movement from either above or below them , and they went on to their room . It was Richard who shut the windows , drew the curtains , and lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . From the outside , this room would still seem to be in darkness . Frances looked wearily towards the bed ; she had never appreciated how soft and white it was . On its counterpanewas spread a very charming dirndl . Richard had seen it too , and paused at the wash basin as he poured the drinkingwater into a glass . " Take a long one , " he advised , when he brought the glass over to Frances . " What 's that for ? " He nodded to the bed . " Frau Schichtl wanted me to wear it to the dance . " Frances peeled off the mud-caked socks with a grimace . Richard brought over a damp sponge smelling of pink geranium . " Do your face and shoulder , " he commanded . He poured water into a basin and carried it over to where she was sitting . He helped her pull off the tattered cardigan and blouse . As she cleaned the cut on her shoulder , he bathed her feet and legs gently . There was a knock at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come in ? " They looked at each other in dismay . Again there was the same timid knock . Richard was about to say Get to hell out of here , but hep231checked himself in time . That would only add to their troubles . If they kept silent , perhaps the woman would think she was mistaken and go away . Instead , the door opened . He rose to his feet . Frau Schichtl paused in dismay . " Oh , excuse me . I am so sorry . " She was just about to turn in embarrassment , when she noticed Richard 's leg . . . And then she looked back again at Frances , holding the towel over her shoulder , and she saw the basin lying at her feet . Richard still held a dripping sponge . Frau Schichtl came in , closing the door quickly and quietly behind her . Her kindly face was clouded with worry and fear . She came over to Richard and took the sponge gently out of his hand , and knelt down beside the basin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is cut very badly . I should get you some hot water . " " Please do n't ; there is n't any time , " said Frances , and then bit her lip as she looked at Richard . k was so easy to make a slip when you were tired and miserable . Frau Schichtl looked quickly up at her face . She compressed her lips , but she said nothing . She dried Frances ' legs very gently . " Have you iodine ? " she asked . Richard handed it to her , and she put it onto Frances ' knees very lightly . " Now some talcum powder on top of these scratches and they wo n't show . " Frances smiled gratefully , and then grimaced as she covered the cut on her shoulder with iodine . " We got lost on the hills , " she explained . Frau Schichtl cleared away the towels and the basin of water , keeping her back carefully turned to Richard , who had started calmly to undress . " I knew something must have happened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They left hours ago . And now you ca n't go to the dance . You would have looked so pretty in that dress . It would have made me very happy to see you in it . " " I should like to wear it , all the same , " said Frances , looking at Richard . That dirndl would be just what she needed . " We may go to the dance . " " But you must go to bed . " Frances shook her head . Frau Schichtl looked quickly from Richard , dressed in clean shirt and shorts , to Frances , fumbling in the chest of drawers for some underclothes . " I think you are in trouble , " she said slowly , at last . Richard said nothing . He was distributing his money and Baedeker , letter of credit , passport , into the pockets of his tweed jacket . He was trying to think how they could leave the house . Unless they were to tie and gag Frau Schichtl and lock her in this room , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought that when I came in here , first . You were so quiet going up the stairs . So quiet in the room . " Frances had slipped into the dress ; she combed her hair , and creamed and powdered the bruise on her forehead , before she turned to face Frau Schichtl . She smoothed the apron . " It is so very pretty , Frau Schichtl . Perhaps I may spoil it . . . perhaps I should n't wear it ? " Frau Schichtl shook her head slowly . " It is your dress now . I have no more use for it . " Her voice had a quiet sadness ; she was lost in thought.  |p233Richard  smiled to himself as he watched the transparent relief in Frances ' eyes . A man would n't have had any scruples , not at a moment like this . Ile folded a suit to take to Smith , along with socks and shut and tic . " You are going ? " said Frau Schichtl . " We are going , " Frances said . Frau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched her tensely . But the sad smile on her face was honest and friendly . " You will need food for the journey , " she said . " Is it these Nazis ? " Frances nodded . " I knew it . Ever since that rough fellow came here so rudely this evening . . . . Will there never be an end to all this hunting of people ? They must not catch you . . . not as they caught my daughter . Where can you go ? " " If we hurry , we shall be safe , " said Richard quietly . He had n't rested since he had reached the room . He was now helping Frances to get her make-up things into her bag . Mascara and all . They were ready , almost . Frau Schichtl spoke again . " When you leave , go out through the kitchen and the back door . I shall hand you bread and cheese . I wish you a good journey to a safer land . " " We can not thank you enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps I am repaying my daughter 's debt to someone who helped her . " " For your own safety , Frau Schichtl , remember that you have n't seen us . You heard us come in and go out again . You thought we had gone to the dance . Can this dress be traced to you ? " " No . There are many like it , and it is a long time since my daughter was here . I have forgotten I ever had these clothes . I shall see you in two minutes , at the back door . " The bedroom door closed gently . Frances looked as if she might cry . She tied the scarf which lay on the bed beside the hand-knitted jacket round her head , and knotted it under her chin . She buttoned on the white-wool jacket . By the time she stared at herself in the glass , she had recovered control of herself . She looked at herself critically in the mirror . " I 'll do , " she said . Richard nodded , and tucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his one decent hat . They looked round the room ; Frances ' eyes flickered for a moment as they rested on the fitted suitcase which Johann had admired so much in Innsbruck . Richard had given her that when they were married . As they went downstairs she wished that she did not get so much attached to certain things . She hoped Frau Schichtl would be allowed to keep it  --  not some little tart of a local Gauleiter . The light was still on in the sitting room , but the curtains had been drawn , so that they could cross the room safely to the kitchen . It was in darkness , and the back door was open so that they could see the stars in the sky beyond . In the shadow of the opened door , Frau Schichtl handed them a large package silently . They did n't speak , but their hands caught hers and held them tightly for a long moment .. . And then they were gone . They walked quickly over the grass , keeping as much in the shadow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon had risen , and the meadows of Pertisau were silvered and treacherous . From the distance came the music of a fiddle and a concertina , and an echoing " Juchhe . " They had reached the last hotel . It stood far back fromP235the road , with large gardens carefully cultivated . They skirted these , thankful for the shrubs and bushes which would make it difficult for them to be seen clearly . . . . And now they were on the road , walking as softly as they could . Smith had said something about trees , Richard remembered . There were some just beyond that patch of grass . It meant that they would have no cover at all until they reached the trees , and they might be the wrong ones . Ile had a strange empty feeling inside him as they covered the white stretch of road , with the silvered grass on one side of them , and the lake rippling with maddening calmness on the other . Probably hunger , he thought . He resisted the impulse to run , to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard the car warming up . It backed out onto the road from the shadow of the trees , just as they reached them . The doors were open , and they were pulled in by eager hands . The car shot forward , and they heard Thornley say , " Good work ! " It was lighter in the car now , because of the moonlight . Smith nodded his approval to Frances . " You 've made good use of your rink , " he said , and began to examine the clothes they had brought him . " Mascara ? " he added . " And food , " Frances said . She opened the parcel of food and shared it out . The atmosphere in the car had changed . Van Cortlandt , without taking his eyes off the road in front of him , joked with Frances as they ate . Thornley had produced the torch again at Smith 's request . He held it ready to shade it , when Smith needed it . Richard helped Smith rip off his clothes . He exchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the cruel weals on Smith 's back . But Smith took no notice of their stare . He was whistling to himself as he drew on the new clothes . With Richard 's help he managed not at all badly , although there was a difficult moment as he tried to pull on Richard 's shirt . It was only by the stiffness of one arm that they noticed it was bruised at the shoulder into a purple jelly . The clothes were loose for him , but the effect was passable . He began on his face , now . Thornley held the shaded torch , and Richard tried to steady the small mirror from Frances ' bag . Smith creamed and powdered the ugly bruises which showed . Ile darkened his eyebrows skilfully , altering their shape , and with the same pencil shaded in the lines on his face . Then he found the small pair of scissors in the bag , and looked at them thoughtfully . " We 'll have to stop to get rid of these anyway , " he said , kicking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Better draw up for a moment ; this is as good a place as any . " It was the beginning of the hill down into Jenbach . On their right was a steep ravine , thickly wooded . They could only hear the water of the stream . It was impossible to see it , at this point , for the undergrowth . Thornley slipped out of the car with the old clothes , and disappeared down the steep bank . When he came back , he reported that he had found a nice thick bush , not very far down . It had been too risky to go any farther . " Not a place for picnicking , or a roll in the hay , " he said . " They should rot there peacefully . " Smith had finished emphasizing a widow 's peak with the scissors . " All right , " he said , and van Cortlandt drove on . Smith took the mascara cream and rubbed it on the back of his hands . Then he tried to smooth it on to his hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me try this , " suggested Richard . I is remembered what he had seen of Smith 's palms . " 1 tucked a pair of chamois gloves into that jacket pocket , " he said as casually as he could . " I find them useful for traveling . " Smith shot a quick glance at him . " Thanks . I 'll need them . " He looked at his hair in the mirror . " That 's about enough ; do n't need much of that stuff . Thanks . I 'll comb it through now . " As Richard wiped his hands , he watched Smith carefully combing the black cream through his hair , finishing by making a neat center parting . The finishing touch was a slight dab of face powder onto the hair above the ears . The transformation was complete . " Not bad , " said Thornley with a grin . " They 'll never recognize you , unless they see your back . " Smith gave his first real smile . I lc had cleaned the back of his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burns on his palms and wrists . Frances had looked round , and remained staring , so that van Cortlandt took his eyes off the road for a moment to look too . He grinned widely . " All you need is a monocle and you 'd be a natural for a Budapest cafe , " he suggested . Smith looked pleased , but he did n't volunteer any information . Richard suddenly remembered the label on the inside pocket of the jacket . Smith ripped it out and read it with interest . " Nice to know your name , " he said . " But it would have taken some explaining . Thanks . What about the hat ? " " It 's all right . You 'd better take my stick , too . But do n't unscrew it until you are in a safe place and can wash it . It 's rather messy . What about a passport ? " " That can be got . By the way , I think you should go right away to this address in Innsbruck . They 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some words on a page from Thornley 's diary , and handed it to Richard . " What about some cash ? " asked van Cortlandt . Smith patted the jacket pocket . " It 's already here . That 's about everything I think . " I lc looked at Richard , and there was a kindly look in his eye . " Richard . " Frances ' voice was urgent . " I 've just remembered . . . what about our bill ? " The men all laughed , even Smith . " It 's all right , Fran . I 've left enough to cover it inside my suitcase . It will be searched , you know . " Van Cortlandt seemed to be enjoying a rich joke . The car was entering the village of Jenbach , running down through the steep street with its motor silent . There were few people out at this time . Jenbach was mostly asleep , it seemed . Smith was watching the street carefully . " Just at that corner , " he said to van Cortlandt , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to the left . " He turned to Richard . " I seem to have caused you a lot of trouble . But perhaps you 'll find some consolation in the fact that I really happen to have discovered something which will be extremely valuable . Quite apart from my own comfort , you really have been most useful . " He leaned over to Frances . " And thank you for your song . Good-by . " The car slowed down . It paused for a moment , and they saw his shadow mix with that of the trees . He was walking , leaning heavily on Richard 's stick , Richard 's hat tilted over his eyes , towards the station , as the car swung to the right for the Innsbruck road . P239THEY would reach Innsbruck in half an hour , or even less , Richard leaned back into the corner , and closed his eyes . It was little enough time to decide on their own plans ; but at least they had done the most they could for Smith . The road was smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains ; on their left was the broad Inn valley and the railway line . Van Cortlandt pointed out the lights of a train moving towards Jenbach . " That takes care of your friend . We 've only you to worry about now , " he said . Richard nodded . Ile wondered if Smith would really take that train , or whether there had been some little house near the station where he might have a friend . He had better stop thinking about Smith . He roused himself to reply to the American , who had looked round at him curiously . " I 've been thinking about that , henry . I think we should follow his example and rid you of ourselves as soon as we get to the outskirts of Innsbruck . Then you can arrive as if nothing had happened , with the excuse if it 's necessary of motor trouble and slow driving . You know the sort of thing . I think that 's the only way . " Thornley said , " It 's not a very good way for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get that passport . " " And some money , " said van Cortlandt . " You 'll not go far without plenty of loose dough . Your travelers ' cheques or your letter of credit will raise hell at any bank in Greater Germany . That chap just about cleaned you out , did n't he ? He was a cool customer , all right . " " He has to be . I expect he has done more than that for others when they were in a jam . " What was it Frau Schichtl had said in that sad slow voice of hers ? Repaying a debt to someone who had helped her daughter . . . only the way she had said it was better than that . " Help each other , or God help you ? " asked van Cortlandt , half-seriously. " 1 lave you any cash , Bob ? " He threw his wallet into the back scat . Thornley caught it , and added his share . 1 le counted it carefully . " It will just about pay for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll need more than this . I can cash a cheque at the bank tomorrow , but how can I get the money to you ? " " Look , " said Richard , " you dump us somewhere just outside Innsbruck . We can walk to that address Smith gave us . I think it 's this side of the town . Have you that light , Bob ? I 'll just make sure . " He studied his Baedeker . " Yes , we can reach it all right . In this costume , we 'll look like any other couple returning from a moonlight walk . Your story is that we left you this afternoon to walk over the mountain towards Hinterriss . When we did n't return , you thought we must have gone right on to Hinterriss and stayed the night there . So when it reached eight o'clock , you left . You had a business appointment to keep . You were delayedin getting to Innsbruck by motor trouble . Henry , try to see your man tonight when you arrive ; have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'll need them , " van Cortlandt said with a grin . " Remember you never saw a house with red shutters.  |p241You  never saw us after we set out for our walk . That 's your story and stick to it . " " That 's our story and we 're stuck with it . " Van Cortlandt was still grinning . " But what 's your angle ? " " We 'll get to that house , and arrange about a passport . They may take us in for the night , or send us to a safe place . And Bob will get the money , as he suggested . Tomorrowone of us will meet you some place about eleven o'clock . It may be Frances ; she is better disguised than I am . The station is no good ; it will be watched . A restaurant is dangerous . . . too many waitresses with an eye for their customers . " He paused for a moment or two . " Try the Franciscan Church . It will have plenty of sightseers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor Maximilian 's monument ; carry a catalogue , or a newspaper , and have the money in an envelope . Slip the envelope inside the catalogue . When you sec Frances , go and sit down in the church itself . Choose a nice dark side . When you finish your meditations , leave the catalogue behind you . Frances will then slip into the seat you 've just left . Would you mind doing that for us ? " Thornley repeated the directions rapidly . " I think I 've got it all , " he said . Van Cortlandt said , " I must say for a couple of amateurs you two are showing high form . " " We go to the movies , " said Frances gravely . He looked at her serious face , and then decided to risk a laugh . " It 's that dead-pan look you English have when you have your little joke which makes us think you 've no sense of humor . You do n't look as if you expected anyone to laugh . " Frances was smiling now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our pleasures are really very simple . "  | " You mean that if I had n't laughed just now , you would have been laughing because I did n't laugh because you did n't laugh . " " I would have had my giggle inside , " admitted Frances . " Do n't you think it 's funny , too ? " Van Cortlandt just shook his head sadly . " About as funny as Punch . And much inure dangerous . It makes people underestimate you . " " But that can he funny , too . " " It 's dangerous . " " What 's dangerous ? " Thornley asked . He was shading the torch again to let Richard study a map . " Being underestimated , " said Frances . " Oh , that ! " he said , and went back to the map . Richard explained . " After we have the cash , and the passport , we 'll make for the border . The nearest one is the Brenner . " " That 's guarded heavily , " warned van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Tyrol . " " Well , it will depend on our disguise whether we risk the train or try the mountains . If it 's guarded heavily , then the Swiss frontier will be thought to be likelier . And the Brenner is probably more strongly guarded on the Italian side than on the Austrian . That suits us . " " And after that ? " " We 'll make for Paris . " " When do you think you 'll be there ? " " With luck , we 'll leave Innsbruck by Sunday at latest . Say next week end in Paris . We 'll leave word for you there with the Consul . We 'll celebrate together . The evening 's on us . "   " I wish I could , " said van Cortlandt , " but I 'm a working man . I 'll see you later in England on my way home . I have your address . There 's one reward I would like , and that 's the whole story . " " I promise you it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any time . " She said it so warmly and earnestly that van Cortlandt reddened , but he looked pleased . " I hate to be the skeleton at the feast , " he said , " but what if you run into difficulties in Innsbruck ? " " We 'll let you know ; we can phone you . If we ca n't phone then it 's too dangerous for you to help us . You 've been dragged into quite enough trouble , as it is . " " I 'll have finished my business there by midday tomorrow . I can be free for the next two days , if you need me . Leave a message at the hotel for me , if I 'm not there . Say that the Times has an assignment for me . That will pass all right , and it 's phoney enough for me to know it comes from you . I 'll let Bob know , unless he 's mixed up with his Czechs . " " There is one very important thing , Henry . Send this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RESERVATIONS UNCANCELLED . ARRIVING FRIDAY . And memorizethis address . " He repeated it carefully . " Got it ? Good . It 's really important . " The lights of the town gleamed in front of them across the Inn . Frances turned to Richard , and smiled . Van Cortlandt said quietly , " I hate to spoil the party , but there 's a couple of cars on our tail . I 've seen their headlights for some time now , but they are still far enough away , if it should be your friends . I 'll slow up round the first bend . Get ready . "  | Frances and Richard looked at each other . Frances remembered how van Cortlandt had increased his speed just when he had asked about difficulties in Innsbruck . " We 'll say our thank-yous in Paris or Oxford , " said Richard . " Good-by , meanwhile . And do n't forget to turn up . And remember the telegram . " He was holding the door open in readiness . They were reaching a bend in the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'll see you , " Frances said quietly , and then without looking back , she raced with Richard for the cover of some bushes . Safely hidden from the road , they watched the taillights of van Cortlandt 's car streak along towards the town . They waited for some minutes , and then they heard the roar of a powerful engine . A large black car , followed closely by another , flashed past them . Richard watched them disappear after van Cortlandt . " Henry was right , I think . Two cars together look as if they had urgent business . I hope they stick to that story . " " They will , " said Frances . " I can see Bob looking rather sleepy and bored , and Henry looking very righteously indignant , calling on his rights as an American citizen . They 'll play it up beautifully between them . I wish I could see it . " " You 're better here . How are the legs ? " " Not so bad . My arm is stiff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round her shoulders , and drew her beside him . They waited in silence . One other car passed along the road ; its moderate pace reassured them . Richard watched the clouds in the sky . He chose the time when one of them , thick and white , began to cross over the face of the moon ; and they were back on the road . They reached the first houses without any trouble . It seemed they were in an open residential quarter , with scatteredp24Shouses and gardens , or what might be called parks , surroundingthem . Richard remembered they were either in or near the district for the large garden restaurants and family excursions . . . All the better . It was also a district for late-evening strollers , making their way slowly back to the town . Ahead of them were a young man and his girl , with their arms linked round each other . The man talked , and the girl would laugh as she looked up at him . " Watch the technique , " said Richard , and measured his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the couple . He clipped his arm round Frances ' waist , and she giggled in spite of herself . " Perfect , " he said , and won another laugh . Perfect , he repeated to himself , as they followed the man and girl towards the bridge over the River Inn . In front of the bridge was a broad , open stretch of ground , where other roads met the one they were on . From the other roads came some more men and girls , forming a slow and scattered trail back to Innsbruck . And there were some cars . These were being stopped by two efficient-looking men in uniform , as they approached the bridge . Richard looked down at Frances , and said some words to her in German . Just in front of them were the couple they had followed . The two uniformed men gave the group of four a brief look , and then turned back to the driver they were questioning . Once they were over the bridge , they left the man and girl . He was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . They would never have noticed who had walked behind them or who had passed them . Richard had taken a street which turned away from the river . After the bright lights at the bridge , it seemed dark and safe . But the journey to the house was like a nightmare for Frances . Richard had kept their pace unhurried , so that they appeared just two more walkers going home with the usual reluctance . The slowness of their steps increased her fatigue . She was painfully conscious of each muscle she had to use , of the hardness of the pavement which hurt her back with each step , of the cracks in the stones which caught her dragging feet . The ill-lighted streets heightened the dark houses ; their silence sharpened every sound . It was less than a mile to the address which Smith had given them , but to Frances it seemed more like five . Richard had knocked as Smith had marked it down on the piece of paper : a spondee followed by a dactyl . In his pocket , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the part with the curious little design marked on it . The rest of the paper had been torn up and dropped piece by piece from the car . As they stood in the darkness of the doorway and looked anxiously up and down the dingy , badly-lighted street with its empty pavements and sleeping houses , he had begun to wonder if he had got mixed up with the address . They were taking a hell of a long time to answer . He visualized the piece of paper as he had seen it in the car . The name , the address , and then Knock  --  ,  --  vv . Then the words Destroy at once ; and then Keep , and a lightly drawn arrow to the foot of the page where the design had been sketched . He remembered everything , even to the jagged line at the top where the page had been torn from Thornley 's diary . He felt Frances sag against him . He knocked again . The door opened so quickly that he knew someone had stood behind it waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , and in any case it was too dark to see anything ; but the someone waited . Richard 's voice was hardly above a whisper . " Herr Schulz ? " The door opened wider and a woman 's voice answered " In ! " They heard the door close behind there gently ; a heavy lock was quietly turned . The hall was unlit , but light came from a room at the back of the house . The woman who had let them inside led the way towards the lighted doorway . She turned to them as she reached it , and motioned them to enter . Frances saw that she was quite young . Her face was what Richard would call just medium : it was neither pretty nor plain . It was quite expressionless . Richard had looked past the woman into the bare , poorly furnished room . A man laid his newspaper aside , and watched them keenly from where he sat . Ile said nothing , just sat and looked . Richard spoke , slurring his words as he had heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were impassive . He picked up his newspaper again . " But my name is not Schulz , " he said , as Richard paused . Richard 's eyes met those staring down at him from the large flag-draped photograph on the wall . For a moment , doubt halted the beat of his heart . IIc felt the sweat break in his palms . . . . And then he was aware that he was still clutching onto the piece of paper in his jacket pocket . He pulled it out , and handed it to the man , still watching inscrutably . The man glanced at it and threw it on the table . " Who gave you this ? " " A man from Pertisau . " " Was his name Gerold ? " " No . Mespelbrunn. "  | " Where do you come from ? " So that explained Smith 's aside as he had handed him the paper in the car . " From over the mountains , " Richard said . The man looked at him again , and then at Frances who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She closed the door , and stood there , leaning against it . " Sit down , " the man said to Richard . His voice was warm , almost friendly . I ! is eyes were now alive , kindly . " Relax . Relax . No need to look so cold . Arc you hungry ? " Richard nodded . The woman moved from the door where she had been standing and went into another room . It was probably the kitchen . Richard heard the sound of a pot being placed on a stove . " Relax , " the man said again . " And how is our friend from Pertisau ? " " He is now well . " " So , he was  --  ill ? We thought so . we have not heard from him for a long time . Well , that 's good news . Good news . What about you ? You said you wanted a room . Is there anything else ? " " The usual . " " You are leaving our happy Fatherland ? " The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the picture on the wall . " Well , it can be arranged . How are you traveling ? " " To Italy . Probably by train . And as quickly as we can . " " Of course ; that is understood , " Schulz said , and smiled . " You might go as Americans or English . You look very like them . Do you know the language at all ? " Richard shook his head.  | " You 'll have to go as Germans , then . How would an engineer do ? Or a schoolteacher ? I 'll get you the right clothes . That will cost you extra , of course , but you 'll find it worth every pfennig . Every pfennig . " " How much will it cost ? " " How much have you ? " Richard restrained a smile . After all , Schulz had been right that his help would be worth every pfennig . " Only three hundred marks , " said Richard . " We can get extra tomorrow to cover the railway fares . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good , " he said . " Good . Three hundred marks will do . " He rose from his chair and went over to Frances . He walked with a marked limp , but he held himself erect . Richard placed his age as about forty . He was almost bald . His face and body had thickened with middle age . Frances , white and silent , looked up and saw the shrewd eyes behind the thick glasses , the kindly smile on the broad mouth . His voice was gentler . " You look afraid of me . You must lose that afraid look . Sometimes people stay here for almost a week , until they lose it . You must look very happy and proud when you cross the frontier . You are the wife of an engineer , who is taking you for a holiday to Florence . But we must change your hair ; it is too pretty . Lisa ! " The woman came back from the kitchen . She carried two bowls of steaming soup . " Lisa , what color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not with these blue eyes . Brown is less noticeable . " " Good . Make it brown , mouse-brown . We can begin tonight . That and the photographs . Then tomorrow we can get the clothes , and the papers . And you will be all ready to leave tomorrow night . Is that quick enough for you ? Now , eat up . Eat up . " The warm bowl of soup brought life back to Frances ' hands . She held her fingers round it , and felt the warmth steal into them . It was almost as good as eating . She felt warm , warm and safe . She looked at the clock on the table . It was almost midnight . She felt warm and safe , safe for the first time in six hours . The man was watching her curiously . " Eat up , " he said gently . " That 's good , is n't it ? " It was the most wonderfulsoup she had ever tasted . The man was speaking to Richard . " You 've had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , we 've come far . " " You will be able to travel tomorrow ? " Schulz was looking doubtful . Richard , remembering Frances ' resilience , smiled . " Oh yes , we shall be all right . We recover quickly . We can keep going until we reach Italy . And then ... well , it wo n't matter then anyway . " " When you first spoke of Italy , I thought I might advise you to try the mountains . They would be safer . But  --  " he looked at Frances doubtfully  --  " I think you will have to stick to your plan about the train . We shall do our best to make the train safe for you . Ready , Lisa ? Good . Good . " Richard had finished eating , and the man began to cut his hair . On the table , the woman had arranged basins and some bottles and a saucer . Frances felt her eyes begin to close . Schulz waved his scissors towards her . " If we can get her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lisa can manage , " he said . " We 'll soon have her upstairs in bed . "  |p251Frances  was helped into the other chair . I 'm being very silly , she thought , but the trouble is that my eyelids are too heavy . She stretched her head back against the neck rest on the chair . It was hideously uncomfortable , but the eyelids won the struggle . She had dim sensations of the woman 's fingers working with her hair , of water trickling across her face . When she was awakened , she saw Lisa looking at her with almost a smile . It was enough to warn Frances of what she might see in the hand mirror which was held out to her . That look which only one woman can give another , that look of pity and amusement combined , roused Frances as no dash of cold water could have done . She took the mirror . Her hair was as bad as she had suspected ; dull brown , lifeless , with the thickness at the back pinned tightly into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrid fascination . Of course it would have had to be her hair , she thought , just because it had been her secret pride . Richard was grinning at her . Then she saw that he was including himself in that grin . his hair had been clipped until it bristled . There was a funny look at the back of his neck . She began to laugh . She had the pleasure of seeing the half smile on Lisa 's face give way to a look of surprise . The man looked up from arranging a large box camera on some books on the table . IIe smiled encouragingly . " That 's better , " he said . " Pretty ones find it harder to escape . Now , if you 'll sit over here , we 'll soon be finished , and you can go to a real bed . " The woman was clearing the table of its litter of basins and towels and hand dryer . She seemed to accept all this madness as a natural way of spending one 's night.  | Richard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chin truculently , and looked on the point of uttering a loud " Heil ! " " Good , " said Schulz , " good . " It was Frances ' turn . She remembered to stare stolidly in front of her and part her lips slightly . We are all quite mad , she thought , or perhaps I am really asleep and dreaming . Sleep . . . sleep . . . it had a pleasant sound . Schulz nodded approvingly . " That 's what we want , " he said . " That 's what we want . " They followed the woman up a dark staircase to a room which was cold and shadowy in the meager candlelight . Frances felt Richard draw off her clothes : she awakened slightly as she heard him swear when his fingers stuck with some fastening on the strange dress . Then the cool rough sheets slid round her . She could not have risen if six storm-troopers had come thundering up the stairs  |p253FRANCES  awoke with a feeling of compulsion . She had something to do . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time . Slowly she began to remember what had happened last night . Her hand went to her hair ; it felt dry and coarse . So it had n't been a dream . . . And there was Richard , with his hair cropped like that of a child who has had fever . He was still asleep ; his arms were thrown above his head ; his face was relaxed . She looked at the cracked ceiling , at the limp curtains drawn over the window . Why had she awakened , what was it that had to be done ? Frances felt herself slipping into sleep again , and caught herself just in time . There was something she had to do . Her eyes fell on her handbag which Richard must have brought upstairs last night and thrown onto the rickety little table under the fly-spotted mirror . That was it , of course . The money . A sudden fear that she was already too late to meet Bob Thornley urged her quickly from the warmth of her bed . After the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt all right . Her body had recovered surprisingly from yesterday 's punishment ; even the shoulder was healing nicely . Richard 's watch told her she had ample time . She washed and dressed quietly . She searched in her handbag , and powdered her face and lips so that her natural color was hidden . Then she removed all traces of powder with her handkerchief . With the dull-brown hair and the subdued face there was quite a difference . She could do nothing about her eyes , though . They were larger and bluer than ever . However , unless she met someone who really knew her , there was little chance of her being identified with the fair-headed English girl whose description was no doubt being circulated . She combed her hair with a center parting , pinning the ends tightly into a knot at the back as the woman had done last night . Before she left the room , she found Richard 's Baedeker in his jacket pocket , and verified from its Innsbruck map the best way to reach the Franciscan Church . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small change might be useful . With a suspicion of a smile she searched Richard 's pockets , and took half of what was left . It would be just enough to pay for a ride in a tramcar and the admission to the Church , if there was one . She kissed Richard lightly again . He did n't even stir . She closed the door gently and went quietly downstairs . Lisa was in the sitting room . She seemed surprised . " I thought you would sleep all morning . " " I must go out . " The woman shook her head disapprovingly . " I must get money for the journey . " The woman accepted that . " You had better have some coffee , first , " she said . " I 've just had a cup . I 'll get one for you . " She went into the kitchen . Frances waited , and looked at the little room , and the corner of the badly-kept garden at the back of the house , which she could just see from her seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a certain businesslike attitude which paralyzed any conversation . Frances was glad ofp255that ; she was somewhat self-conscious about her Bavarian accent . She drank the coffee , and looked at the patch of garden . She felt a kind of excitement inside her . She would have liked to have given a war whoop  --  but Lisa was there . Her matter-of-fact kind of sanity smothered Frances ' impulse , and she contented herself with looking at the garden and having another cup of coffee . She rose to leave . " Not that way , " said the woman . " Go out by this door : across the yard . Keep near the wall , under the trellis , and it will shelter you . Enter the door at the other end of the path . Walk through that house , and you 'll find yourself in a shoemaker 's shop . Just say as you pass that Lisa sent you . You 'll be all right . " " Would you tell my husband that I 'll be back about twelve ? " The woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' shoulders . " Leave this in the shop , " she said . She did n't wait for Frances to thank her . She was already carrying the coffee cups into the kitchen . As she turned to push the door open with her hip bone , she smiled  --  a friendly , encouraging smile . And then the kitchen door closed behind her . Frances turned toward the door in the living room which she had thought was a cupboard door . It led on to a narrow paved path beside a high wall , from which a coarse green climbing plant stretched greedily over the trellis above her head . In front of her were the backs of the houses on the next street . Everything happened as Lisa had said it would . The cobbler in the front shop scarcely paused in his work as Frances slid the cape onto the counter . He did n't seem to hear her words . Outside in the street , there was the usual activity of a respectable working-class neighborhood.  | Housewives carried shopping bags made of knotted string . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of them wore a kind of uniform , others the usual short leather breeches and white stockings . She walked with increasing confidence to the end of the street . If she followed the tramlines from there , she would reach Museumstrasse , and then it would be easy to find the Church . It was the long , but the safe , way and she had plenty of time . The walk was not unpleasant . In the busier streets , she felt still safer . She was just another girl dressed in another dirndl . At the corner of the narrow street which led to the square on which the Church stood , the traffic was heavy . Frances tried to avoid two women whose breadth filled the narrow pavement . She was swept against the window of a shop . Climbing boots , sports things , she noticed , and then , with her eyes still fixed on the window , she collided with a girl coming out of the shop 's doorway . She was a tall , blonde girl , her arms filled with parcels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an apology . The girl remained standing , her eyes on Frances ' face , but Frances hurried on . It was Anni , looking just as she had looked in their garden at Oxford on her last night there . " I looked at her too directly . She half-recognized my eyes , or perhaps she saw that I knew her , " Frances thought . She glanced at her reflection in another window . She could n't see much resemblance to herself , but she would have to watch her eyes , and her way of walking too . It was much too smooth . She would have to set her heels more firmly on the ground , in a kind of jaunty march . As she turned the corner to enter the Church , she looked back overp257her shoulder . Anni was still there , and , as Frances looked , she made up her mind and started towards the Church . Frances already regretted that afterlook . What a fool she was . She quickened her pace and hurried up the steps of the building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She paid the admission to a man with heavily pouched eyes and a drooping mustache . At least that would prevent Anni from following her inside the Church : she had never spent a penny more than she could help in Oxford . Perhaps Anni was already thinking she had been mistaken . In the nave where the Maximilian monument was she saw Thornley . He was standing , appropriately enough , in front of King Arthur 's statue , with a catalogue in his hands . It was good to see him again , looking so untroubled , so completely unconscious of everything . She wandered round the statues as the other visitors did . She did n't look at him as she rudely passed in front of him to reach Theodoric the Terrific , King of the Ostrogoths . When she had admired sufficiently , she walked slowly towards the little chapel . Thornley was seated in the shadows . As she moved slowly towards him , he rose , and they passed each other without a glance . The catalogue had been left on a chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it . She waited while the other visitors came and went . Some sat down , some tiptoed about talking in penetrating whispers , others knelt . After long minutes she dared to move her fingers under cover of her skirt and feel for the small fat envelope inside the catalogue . Slowly , without any visible movement , her hand pulled it out and folded it into her palm . It was done . It was over.  | She reached the street , and slipped the scarf off her head . As she tied it round her shoulders , she slipped the envelope into the bodice of her dress . Under the fringe of scarf , it would n't be noticed  --  and it felt safe . There was no sign of Bob . But there was Anni . She had got rid of her parcels , and had been sitting in the little square of trees opposite the Church . She had seen Frances ; she was almost runningacross the street . Frances bit her lip . There were two storm-troopers standing in front of the Church steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted . There was n't any time , anyway . The men had already noticed Anni 's haste and were watching her with casual interest . Frances made her voice enthusiastic . " Anni ! I have n't seen you for weeks ! How are you ? " Anni looked at her in amazement ; she was speechless . It was the accent which had dumbfounded her . It was no longer the carefully spoken German which she had heard in Oxford . Frances was glad of the silence . She began to walk along the pavement , her hand on Anni 's arm warning her with some pressure . They were passing the two troopers , whose interest had become more anatomical . " How are your Mother and Father ? " " Quite well , gna  --  " The pressure on Anni 's arm stopped her politeness . " And your brothers ? " " Also well . " " And your sister ? " " The same . " They had passed the two men safely . Frances relaxed . " Cheer up , Anni . You look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street towards thep259garden in the square . In the quietness there , she faced Frances. " 0 gnadige Frau ! " She looked as if she were going to cry . " Cheer up , Anni . It 's all right . But do n't call Inc that . " Anni said , " I knew something was wrong . I have beenso worried about you . " " How ? " They were both talking in undertones , pacing slowly under the trees . Anni blinked back her tears . " I knew you were here in Innsbruck , about a week ago . One of my brothers has a friend . He is the houseman in the hotel where you stayed . He knew I had lived in Oxford , of course , and he told me about the two English guests who came from there . That was how I found out that you were here . " " That was Johann , was n't it ? " Anni 's cheeks colored . " Yes . When he learned I had lived with you , I made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Frances was surprised . " Why , Anni ? " Anni looked confused . " My sister always disbelieved me about England . When I told them about your house and clothes , she would only laugh . If she had learned you were staying in that place , she would have made fun of me to everyone . " " We stayed in that place because we like the old town , Anni , " Frances said gently . That was true . They had chosen to live in the old town when they had last visited Innsbruck , although the hotel then had been an innocent place compared with their choice this time . Anni looked relieved that Frau Myles was still smiling . " Yes , " she said , " that 's what Johann told the police today . "  |p26oFrances  almost stopped walking . " Anni , tell me all you know . " " I saw Johann this morning . We usually meet when I cycle into the town . " Anni blushed again , and hesitated , but Frances waited in silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel , and searched and questioned . They asked very particularly about you and the Herr Professor . Johann only knew that you came from Oxford and that you were on holiday . " " What about the owner of the hotel ? " " He left the hotel just after a telephone call came for him very late last night . No one has seen him since . So Johann was in charge when the police came . They seemed very angry . " Frances said nothing . Mr. Smith seemed to think of everything , she thought , even of the fact that their travels in Germany and Austria would be retraced . She would have liked to know how he had got that telephone call through to Kronsteiner without giving himself away . Possibly it had come through another agent . . . But if there had been a ghost of a chance left for their simple-traveler story , it had vanished along with Kronsteiner . His disappearance would confirm all the suspicions against them . Anni 's face grew more worried as she watched Frances walk so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do the police know that you were with us in Oxford ? " Anni shook her head . " Johann never said anything about that . He did n't want to mention my name . " " I am sorry that we met today , Anni . I had better leave you now ; it is too dangerous for you . " " But , gnddige Frau , I must help . What is wrong ? "  | " We must leave Austria at once . " Anni was silent . Then at last she said , " Johann could lead you over the mountains . " " Into Germany ? That 's worse still . " " He also knows the South Tyrol . He was born there . He escaped over the mountains when the Italians were conscriptingthe Austrians for the war in Abyssinia . " " That border is now heavily guarded . " What was it that Schulz had said last night when she was half-asleep ? .. . something about advising the mountains rather than the train , if she had n't been so exhausted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schulz would n't hesitate to advise them to go by the mountains if he saw her today . She disliked the idea of the train , for in a train you were trapped in a box . Anni was speaking again . " But there is a way , if you know the mountains . Johann knows . " Frances was tempted . But she said , " No , Anni . Besides , Johann must not risk anything for us . " " He would do it if I asked him . " " No , Anni . Better not . Do n't tell anyone that you have seen me ; not even Johann . " Anni was still searching for some plan . " I ca n't ask you to come to our house . My sister hates the English , although she has never known any . My brothers would not help . They are afraid like my parents . " " Thank you a thousand times , Anni . But you must not help . " Anni began to cry . Frances watched her tears with distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall be all right . " " Where is the Herr Professor ? "  | " He is waiting for me . I must go now , or he will be worried . " " Please tell me the address . Then when I have thought out some plan I can come to you this afternoon and tell you about it . " Frances had an idea . " You said Johann knew a way over the mountains ? If he could draw a map of it would you  --  " no good saying post it ; perhaps Schulz was known by another name altogether . Frances paused . How on earth were they to get hold of the map ? " I 'll bring it to you , " Anni said eagerly . " Then you must come when it 's dark . Can you get away this evening without making anyone suspicious ? " " On Saturday , yes . I look after my brother 's shop then , and I am often late before I reach home . " " And do n't tell Johann that the map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safer for everyone . Can you think of some excuse for him ? " Anni said she could manage Johann . She repeated the address which Frances told her . Tonight she would slip the map under the door of that house ; and then she would forget the address forever . She promised . She was smiling again , as Frances said good-by . She seemed happier now that she could be of some use after all . Frances recrossed the street . She felt she had every right to be pleased with herself . Such a map would be most useful , if , for instance , the train seemed too risky . There was no doubt that the search was on . She thought of Kronsteiner . Trains would be watched , perhaps searched . As for giving Anni the address  --  well , Anni would keep her promise . The secret would be safe . Anni was under no suspicion . She would not be followed , as Henry or Bobp263would be . . . And Anni did not know the importance of the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were plenty of such houses in that district . Everything began to look easy ; and that was probably her undoing . If Henry could drive them almost to the frontier , they could follow the path over the mountains , and then meet Henry somewhere on the other side . He could take along their Schulz clothes , pack them somewhere in his suitcase , and they could change in his car once they had finished the climb . It was all so simple . She imagined Richard 's look of surprise and amusement when she would present him with the idea . It was n't at all bad , she admitted with some pleasure to herself . In her excitement , it was understandable that she forgot . She forgot that if you are playing a part you must live it , and forget your own identity . She should have been Mitzi Schmidt going to meet Fritzi Muller ; but at the moment she was very much enjoying being Frances Myles . She walked quickly with her light smooth step . If she hurried she would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had chosen a window table next to where a young American and Englishman had sat , saw the Austriangirl who walked in that familiar way . He was suddenlyalert . The color of her hair and of her face were different , but there was something equally familiar in that hint of a smile and the tilt of the nose , the shape of the eyes . She passed . He recognized the set of the shoulders , the shape of her legs . Yesterday he had watched them in a green meadow , from a doorway . He did n't need to verify his guess from the table next him , where the restless Englishmanand the talkative American had suddenly become still and silent.  | Van Cortlandt and Thornley looked at each other . " He 's gone , " said Thornley needlessly . " God , he 's recognizedher . " " Are you sure it 's that man ? " " Richard described him . Fits in . Cheek slashes , fair hair , gold-chain bracelet . " " He thinks it important enough to leave us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thornley rose abruptly . " I 'll follow and phone you at the hotel , if I can find where he has taken her . I 'll phone you anyway . You had better stick to the hotel and wait for a call from Richard . He 's bound to give you a ring when Frances does n't turn up . " Van Cortlandt began to object , but Thornley had alreadyleft . The American paid the bill gloomily . He was just to go back to the hotel and wait . He was just to wait for phone calls . That was fine ; that was just fine . There were times when playing the neutral tried even a neutral 's temper . Thornley saw the tall German and the girl in the Austriandress ahead of him . The German had made no attempt to catch up with her . He was walking at some distance behind her . That way she would lead him to Richard . Thornley crossed the street as a precaution , but either the German had not expected to be followed , or he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage would prevent the drama from drawing to its close . . . . But he had not reckoned with the inspiration of the amateur . Thornley saw several bicycles parked outside a cafe . He calmly swung himself onto one of them , and raced after Frances . His improvising was more successful than he hadp265hoped . Three angry young men rushed out of the cafe and mounted bicycles too . Their yells were enough to make everyone in the street look round . And Frances had looked . And she had seen , too , for her step slackened and then she turned abruptly into an alley . The German broke into a run , and a slow-moving motor car suddenly ignored all rules of traffic to cross over to him . Thornlcy cursed himself for ever imagining that the German would be alone . A short command had been given , and the car speeded into the next street . Thornley guessed that it probably led round to the other entrance of the alley . He hesitated , wondering desperately what his next move should be . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were in uniform . " I am very sorry , " he said . " I was going to bring the bicycle back . I thought I saw a girl I must speak to , and she was far away . There was no time to ask your permission . " One of the boys looked amused , but the owner of the bicycle was less amenable , until he noticed the money in Thornley 's hand . " To pay for the wear on the tires , " said Thornley tactfully . " Where is she now ? " asked the one who had smiled . " She went up that small alley . " " But it has another entrance ! There 's a short-cut ! Come on . There 's still time if we hurry . " Thornley found himself cycling furiously with the three young men grouped round him . The romantic one was enjoying himself . The other two were obviously intending to find out if the story about the girl was true . They followed a very narrow side street , which brought them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . And there it was just ahead of them , standing at the end of the alley , ready to drive off . The back of the car was towards them , and the only one whose face they could see was the German with the scars . He was just getting into the front seat beside the driver . Behind was Frances , wedged in between two uniforms . Thornley screened himself behind the young men as they dismounted . They had stopped as soon as they had seen the open Mercedes . They were looking at him strangely . " Was that your girl ? " the romantic one demanded . His tone had changed completely . Thornley , his eyes fixed on the disappearing number plate of the car , shook his head . He was all disappointment . " No . But from the distance their figures and legs were the same , though . " This proved a mild joke . The kindliest of the three relaxedagain . " Just as well she was n't your girl , " he said comfortingly . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk too much , Fritz , " interrupted the one who had taken the money . The third young man had stopped laughing . There was an uncomfortable pause . " What about some beer ? " Thornley suggested . They were stiffly sorry . There were meetings this afternoon , and processions . There was much to arrange before it began . They had all suddenly become very important . They straightened their shoulders and gave him a co-ordinated farewell . Thornley gave them a careless wave of his hand and thanked them again , solemnly . They swung onto their bicycles , but he noticed that the one he disliked looked carefully over his shoulder to watch him enter the res/taurant which he had suggested . He stayed there for a few minutes , long enough to let the cyclists leave the street , long enough to write down the curious number of the black car and to find the telephone with its directory . But there was nothing under Dreikir  --  He left the restaurant . Perhaps he might try the post office . He could have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . And then he remembered Prague . No , the post office would n't do . It might be dangerous ; too risky . It was obviously quite useless trying to trace the car . That would rouse instant suspicion . He remembered the guarded look on the young men 's faces when they had first seen the car , the way in which they had dismountedso quickly at a safe distance . One thing he did know : the young man who had talked almost too much had recognized von Aschenhausen . That had been obvious . He left the street as quickly as he could , in case the suspiciousyoung man had changed his mind and returned , and walked quickly towards van Cortlandt 's hotel . The shops were crowding round him once more . Ile noticed a tourist office and halted . Inside , he found a number of people booking their seats for that afternoon 's excursions . They crowded round the various tables , each with its clearly-marked notice of a special tour . Beside the one labeled BRENNER , a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the only advertised excursion for anywhere near a frontier . Thornley noted the size of the group round that table  --  the Brenner was popular , it seemed  --  and decided to risk it . He approached the desk marked INFORMATION at the other end of the large room . Behind it , a girl was hand- ing out timetables and a few kind words to two men . Thornley , with his fair hair , his shorts and light gray tweed jacket , his almost white stockings and nail-studded shoes , felt safe enough beside them . The men were satisfied , at last , and left . He purposely chose the same place they had been asking about . That would take less time for the girl ; and it might muddle her , later , if she were questioned . The girl smiled at his request . " Kitzbihl ? It is very popular today . You will find all information in this . " She handed him one of the brightly illustrated folders which she still held in her hand . He opened it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked up with a smile . " This is excellent . " The girl seemed pleased . " Now , would you be good enough to tell me where the post office is ? I have just arrived in Inns-bruck . " " In the Maximilianstrasse . " " Is that far from here ? I am late for an engagement al-ready . " " It is quite a little way . " " It concerns a letter I want to post at once , and I have mislaid the address . I remember it began with Drei . Dreikir  --  like that . " " Ah  --  Dreikirchen . We used to have buses which visited it . But not now . " She was looking at him curiously . " Do you know someone there ? " Thornley took his cue . " I was given the address two years ago . But my friend will still be there . I never heard that he had gone . " " Did he belong to the Church ? " The girl had lowered her voice.  | " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . " It 's all changed now . " " Well , they will redirect the letter . . . I 'll post it at once . Now would you advise today or Monday for Kitz-biihl ? " A man and a woman had come up behind him . " Today will be more crowded . " " And the bus will leave outside this office ? " " Just across the street . I hope you will enjoy yourself at Kitzbiihl . Everyone does . " She was a nice girl , the kind who really liked to please the customers . Thornley thanked her , and studied the folder as he made his way out of the office . The queue at the Brenner table was still large . The man beside it was listening intently to each excursionist 's request . On the pavement , Thornley drew a deep breath . He stuffed the folder into his pocket . It would make a nice little souvenir along with the electric torch . The policeman'shelmet hanging above his mantelpiece at Cambridge began to seem a poor effort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cortlandt 's hotel . He hoped to high heaven that Richard was already worried about Frances , and that he had phoned . At least they knew the name of the place . . . . That was something.  |p170RICHARD  woke about eleven o'clock , and his worries began with the empty bed beside him . He ought to have wakened in time to see Frances and talk to her . In fact , he ought to have gone himself , even if Frances had been more adequately disguised . He dressed quickly , cursing at his slight stiffness , his lateness , his difficulty in shaving with cold water . When he got downstairs , the woman had reheated the coffee . It was black and bitter , but it cleared his head . Twelve o'clock , the woman had said . He drank more coffeein spite of its taste , and read the newspaper . There was no mention of the Pertisau incident . So they were keeping it quiet , meanwhile . Von Aschenhausen might be making desperate efforts to turn his failure into success , before anything was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility , in the hope of presenting his chiefs with a large and very complete haul , then he would be in a dangerous position himself , if he had failed . He had tried for too much ; he had been too ambitious . That would make their own escape twice as difficult . Von Aschenhausenwould have to catch them or face very unpleasant consequences . . . . And then , there was the matter of his pride , and revenge . Vindictiveness was one of the strongest German traits . Richard sat and looked at the patch ofp271garden as Frances had done . But his feelings were very different . Twelve o'clock had long passed . The woman was sympathetic , but calm : there was no need to worry . Innsbruck'sstreets were very difficult for strangers , and she assured him for the second time that his wife 's appearance was safe enough . But by one o'clock , the woman was anxious too . She was obviously afraid for Schulz and herself . Richard did not blame her . " Can I phone safely from some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pointed across the back yard to a house in the next street . And then the doorbell rang . They looked at each other , with hope and fear allied in their eyes . Richard moved behind the sitting-room door , where he could see through the chink into the hall . He saw her open the front door slightly . Someone handed her an envelope , and he heard a familiar voice . " May I see the Herr Professor ? " Richard was startled . It could n't be , it could n't . . . But the door had opened farther , and there was no doubt . " Anni ! " he almost shouted . " Come in ! " The woman was so taken aback that Anni and her broad smile were already inside the house . Richard seized her arm and pulled her into the sitting room . " Anni , " he said again . " How on earth did you get here ? " Anni was delighted with his amazement , just in the same way as when she used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Oxford . For her answer , she took the envelope back from the woman and handed it proudly to him . Frances , he thought ; it must be a message from Frances . What had happened ? Was she waiting somewhere for him ? He ripped the envelope roughly open . All it containedwas a small diagram , a sheet of paper with a map and no names . " There 's the Brenner , " said Anni , pointing to a small penciled circle . " I thought it was better not to write in the names ; instead , you will memorize them . That is why I had to see you . " Richard looked quickly from the map to Anni . " How did you know we needed this ? How did you know you would find me here ? " " The gnadige Frau . . . did n't she tell you ? " " When did you see her ? " " After she came out of the Church . " " At what hour was that ? " Anni looked worried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother 's shop just after twelve , and that was the time Johann comes to see me on Saturdays . You see , that is the afternoon my brother goes to the mountains  --  he 's a guide on Saturdays and Sundays  --  and I look after the shop for him , then . So when Johann came , I got him to draw this , and I brought it to you at once . The gnadige Frau said tonight , but that was only because she was afraid for me . I thought you might want it now , so that you could leave at once . I did n't tell Johann about you . I promised I would tell him later , and it will be all right because he liked both you and the gnadige Frau . " Richard sat down for a moment . Anni saw the look in his face . " The gnadige Frau told you nothing of our plans ? What is wrong , Herr Professor ? Is she not here ? " " No , " said the woman gravely , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said she must hurry . She said you would be worried if she did n't . . . Oh , Herr Professor ! " Anni was so upset that Richard rose and took her hand . So his fears had been real . While he had waited and worried , something had happened to Frances . Something must have happened . If he could only stop feeling so damned sick with worry . This was no damned good , standing here patting Anni 's hand like a blasted idiot . Something had to be thought of , something had to be planned . They had lost an hour already . " Tell me , Anni , how did you recognize Mrs. Myles ? " " I looked right into her eyes , and they recognized me . And then there was something in the way she walked , the shape of her legs . It was because I know her so well that I could recognize her . " " Then someone else who knew her well might have recog  --  " He could n't finish . lie left Anni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back to them , looking out into the garden . He thought of van Cortlandt and Thornley . He must get in touch with them , and at once . . . But what then ? What then ? He must stop this . He had to keep calm , had even to forget that Frances was his ; he had to think of all this mess in the way he had thought of Smith , as a kind of problem . And he needed all his wits about him to find a solution . Emotion would only hinder ; worry might lose her forever . He turned back to the room . " Anni , could you go back to the shop and wait there until an American and an Englishmancome to buy climbing boots ? " Anni heard his calm voice with amazement , but it lessenedher fears . If the Herr Professor saw some hope , then there was hope . She listened to his descriptions of the two men who would come to buy climbing boots . She memorizedtheir names carefully , and the message she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anni was not enthusiastic about that message . The Hungerburg was so big that they might miss each other . It was safe enough for them there , she agreed , but they might be late before they met each other . She did n't like to take the responsibilityof the message . If anything went wrong , then she would blame herself . " It would be better to meet them in the shop , and see them yourself . It would save time , " she suggested . " There is a storeroom at the back of the shop with its own entrance . You could wait there until your friends arrived . My brother has left already , and Johann must go back to the hotel as soon as I get back to the shop  --  I left him in charge so that I could come here . There will be no one there except me . " She laughed at any danger to herself . If the worst came , he would be an unknown customer ; and there was the back entrance losing itself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong there was at least a chance to escape . Richard agreed with her in his heart . It would be the simplest solution , and the quickest one . That was the chief thing . Now that the suggestion had come from Anni herself , he accepted it gladly . Anni had left by the back door , with a loden cape thrown round her shoulders . He waited for two or three minutes until she would be safely out of the other house , hoping against hope that Frances might suddenly appear . The woman was obviously worried , but she was unexpectedly sympathetic . Herr Schulz would be home any minute now ; she had the dinner table all ready for him . And he wouldp275be able to advise them . Meanwhile , she offered him a bowl of thin brown soup with dumplings submerged in it . He must eat . Richard declined as politely as his revolving stomach would permit ; worry churned him up inside like a Channel crossing . He had his eyes on his watch . Three minutes , he had thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could n't wait any longer . He suddenly left the room . " Say Lisa sent you , " the woman called after him . The formula worked . The cobbler obligingly made the call for him , and then left him alone with the telephone . He heard van Cortlandt 's voice , and such a wave of relief swept over him that he realized he had been afraid of getting no answer . " Hello ! " said van Cortlandt , and waited . " Hello , there ! " " Van Cortlandt ? " " Speaking . " It was easier to talk now ; the words which had deserted him came rushing out . Van Cortlandt said , " Oh , yes , the Times . I 'm sorry I 'm late with that article . Clad you called . I thought you would because of this delay . " " Serious ? " So van Cortlandt knew already ; that saved explanations . " At the moment , yes . " " Well , there 's another article to write . Beauties of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just my own two feet . " " Well , better add something to that . If you have n't boots , get them this afternoon . This is a rush assignment . Go to any good sports dealer , and he will advise you . There 's Schmidt , or Spiegelberger , or Rudi Wachter . Hep276is particularly good . You 'll find him on the Burggraben near the Museumstrasse . " " Good . I 'll go there at once . Hope to see you soon . " " I 'll see you soon . Get a move on with the article , wo n't you ? No delay for this one . " " Sure ; you can depend on me . Love and kisses to Geoffrey Dawson . " " And mine to Luce . " Richard heard a sudden laugh at the end of the phone , and then silence . In the sitting room , Richard found Schulz sitting at the table , his head well clown to his bowl of soup . Of Lisa , there was no sign . Schulz , busy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the soup pot . Richard poured himself some coffee , and gulped it down . He thought of the brandy in his flask , but they might need that later on . " I must go at once , " he said . " My wife  --  " " I know . " Schulz wiped his lips , and swallowed some water . " I know . Lisa told me . There are all your papers and clothes . " He nodded to a large envelope and a neat brown-paper parcel on a side table . Richard rose , and brought the envelope over to the dinner table . The documentlooked convincing ; the photographs had just the right moronic look . " Were we quick enough for you ? That 's everything , I think ; everything . You 've paid me . Have you any money left ? " " I 'll meet some friends , " Richard said . " Well , good luck . " Richard 's words came haltingly . " My wife may have been arrested . They may trace her movements to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't worryP277about that . I had already decided to change my address . I saw your friend Kronsteiner early this morning , at my place of  --  business . He had a message last night from our friend who used to be at Pertisau . So we are on the move again . Lisa is packing now . " He smiled as he saw the relief on Richard 's face . Richard prepared to go . They shook hands silently . Then Schulz suddenly spoke . " Courage ! " he said . " Courage ! It 's the only real weapon we 've got . A man can win when he still has his courage . " Richard nodded . " I 'm sorry if we have upset your plans . " " They are always being upset , but we go on . And do n't worry about Kronsteincr . He 's all right . He 's much changed since his visit to me this morning . " Schulz threw back his head and laughed . Kronstciner 's change seemed to amuse him . . . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a pity to leave it , " he explained , his voice once more matter-of-fact . Lisa met Richard at the doorway . " This was all you left upstairs , " she said , and held out his small razor case , and Frances ' bag . He nodded his thanks , and watched her slip them safely into the brown-paper parcel . " We 'll give you five minutes , and then we leave , " called Schulz , in the middle of the last dumpling . " Good-by , young man , and courage . " Lisa gave him her first and last smile . He closed the door softly , and walked unhurriedly down the street . The brown-paper parcel attracted no attention . It was almost two o'clock . P178ALL INNsBRUCIK seemed to be marching that Saturday . There had been two parades already , complete with bands , banners and uniforms . The onlookers crowded into the principal streets , through which the processions passed , and even after they had gone the people waited . Perhaps there were still other processions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly through the deserted little side streets , and he arrived at the back entrance of the Wachter shop in record time.There was no one in sight , as he opened the back door and walked quietly into the small room which Anni had described as a storeroom . This was it , all right . He moved carefully and slowly between the neat stacks of boxes to a crate under the small , high window . No one would be able to look in through that window , unless he brought a stepladderalong with him . He sat down on the edge of the crate , and waited . He could hear a murmur of voices , and once Anni laughed . The sounds were distant enough to assure him that a room lay between the storeroom and the front shop itself , where Anni was serving a customer . No one had seen him , no one had heard him enter ; so far , so good- If anyone were to look into the room , the rows of boxes would hide him . He began to feel better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He rose suddenly , and examined the lock of the door by which he hadP279entered . It worked easily , so he locked it . Better that , than to risk some unknown visitor using this street door at an awkward moment . It would be a simple matter to unlock the door and escape by the alley , if any complication arrived . There was that other door , the one which must lead into that middle room ; but he could n't do anything about it until Anni appeared . The voices were silent now . The customer must be going , for he heard the accustomed formula , and Anni 's dutifulecho . There was a sound of a bell . Of course , that would be the door closing . Anni must have brought back one of those doorbells as a present for her brother after all . She had said she would . He smiled in spite of himself . It was rather odd to hear the familiar Oxford sound right here in Innsbruck . It made him think of a dark little shop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neat white jars on its shelves ; and the polished brass scales , on which the light and dark tobaccos were weighed before they were mixed and then carefully emptied into your pouch ; and the darkened oak counter , with its rubber mat for your coins , and the change which came to you from the old wooden till ; and then the gentle note of the bell as you opened and shut the door . The bell was silent again , and he heard Anni 's footstepsapproaching . The door into the middle room opened , and she stood straining her eyes into the dim light . He stepped out from behind the boxes . " God be thanked , " she said . " Did you hear me at all ? " She shook her head . " No . I 've been coming through here between visits from customers , just to make sure . Have you locked that door ? Good . I 'll lock this one too . Thep280room next you is a dressing room , where customers try on sports clothes if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just keep quite still . But if anyone with a loud voice tries this door , and rattles it , and asks me angrily for the key , then leave at once . " The front doorbell rang . " It has been very useful , that hell , " said Anni in a whisper . She turned to go , but Richard caught her arm as he heard a cheery voice call : " Anyone here ? " from the front shop . That must be Thornley . It was . " That was a darned lucky break , if you ask me , " said van Cortlandt in English . Their voices sounded as if they brought good news . Anni looked at Richard inquiringly . He nodded , and she went through to meet them . He heard the men ask about climbing boots , but Anni 's voice was too low for him to know what she had answered . He heard them suddenly quieten , and follow her quickly towards the storeroom . She locked the door behind them , and they were left alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God , and are n't we glad to see you , " said van Gortlandt . " Frances ? " Richard asked . Thornley spoke . " They got her . Just the rottenest luck . It was the fair-haired blighter with the bracelet who saw her , and recognized something . They 've taken her to Dreikirchen . That 's all I could find out . That and the number and identification marks of the car . " He groped in his pocket for the sheet from his diary where he had scribbled the signs down in that restaurant , just after the boys had left him.  |p281The  door was unlocked , and Anni entered the room with Tyrolese jackets over her arm . She handed them to van Cortlandt and Thornley . " Where is Dreikirchen , Anni ? Is it a village or a house ? Have you ever heard of it ? " " If the doorbell rings , get back into the dressing room , and try these on , in front of the mirror , " she said to the American . " Lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that high shelf , there . " She turned to Richard . " Now that we 've made things safe , Herr Professor , there is only one Dreikirchen near here . It 's just two hours ' walk from here  --  to the south of Innsbruck . If you follow the Brennerstrasse , you will reach the Berg Isel , and Dreikirchen is to the right of that . I will show you on the map ; you have one ? " Richard had already taken his Baedeker out of his pocket , and was searching for the Berg Iscl . Anni looked over his arm , and pointed with her finger . " There 's the road . You see that small line on its right ? That is the side road which takes you to Dreikirchen . There it is  --  these black squares grouped together . " " Is it a village , and why is n't it named ? " " It is n't a village . It is too small  --  just a few small houses and the monastery and three little chapels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there now ? " Anni seemed embarrassed . She was n't sure . She had heard her brothers talk , of course , but they had never explained . One of their friends had been sent there . " Is it a concentration camp ? " asked van Cortlandt . Anni was shocked . Oh , no . Nothing like that . There were boys at Dreikirchen , who were being educated.  | Specially chosen boys and young men . She admitted there were rumors . Of course , there always were rumors , but people did n't try to find out about rumors , not if they were wise . " Has it any connection with the Gestapo ? " asked van Cortlandt again . Anni looked frightened . There were rumors , she said . . . And once Johann had made a joke about that in front of one of her brothers , and that was the only time they had quarreled . Richard thanked her ; that was all she knew or wanted to know . As she left them , Thornley stopped her . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers on it , what would you think ? " He held out the page from his diary . " Special car , " she said . " Secret police ? " Anni nodded . " I must go back into the shop , " she said , and left them . " Were you followed ? " " We were at first , " said van Cortlandt . " And then we had a break . The whole place is jammed with people . So we got mixed up with two processions , and here we are without our tail . We are probably safe for another ten minutes , until he reports to headquarters and they give him a list of our shopping places . They no doubt listened in to our talk on the phone today . So now let 's get busy . " Richard said , " Thanks for all you 've done . It would have been hopeless without you . " " Say , we 're in on this too , " said van Cortlandt . He turned to Thornley . " Imagine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of us at this stage . It will take three of us to find Frances . And she 's got to be found . "   " We 'll find her , " Thornley said quietly . Richard did n't waste any more time . 1 le spread the map before them . " We 'll meet here , " he said , pointing to a part of the road as it touched the Berg Isel . " Bring a car , and all your things packed . And take this parcel and pack the things in it into your case . It 's our stuff for Italy . " " I 've arranged about the car , " said van Cortlandt . " That radio man agreed to an exchange . He 'll keep his mouth shut . He 's going to Vienna this afternoon , and is traveling the Jenbach road . I 've already told the hotel I 'm going back to Pertisau to look for my friends . It all fits in nicely . " Richard looked at the American with respect . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about all . Meet me at that place any time after four o'clock . That will let me get out there safely . And bring some chocolate and cigarettes . " " Say half-past four , " said van Cortlandr . They shook hands . " We 'll be seeing you , " he added , and followed Thornley back into the shop . Richard waited for Anni . She hurried into the storeroom , and unlocked the back door . " Good-by , Herr Professor , and give the gnadige Frau my . . . " She bit her lip . " Please let me know when she is safe . Please . " " Yes , Anni . " " Please hurry , Herr Professor . " " Yes , Anni . " What could he say to thank her enough for what she had done ? Anni seemed to sense his difficulty . She smiled sadly . " I am only repaying your kindness in Oxford . The gnadige Frau was always so good to me . " She opened the door and motioned him out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and held it . " Auf Wiedersehen . " Her smile was quivering . And then the door closed behind him , and already his steps had taken him far enough away to keep Anni safe . Here was the street corner , and the crowds . He loitered with them until the saw ' hornlcy and van Cortlandt leave the shop . They were carrying two or three parcels . He watched them until they were lost in the crowd . He felt suddenly hungry , but he had just enough money to take him to the Berg Isel by tramcar . That would save his legs for tonight 's climb . He and Thornley could get Frances over the frontier , and van Cortlandt could take their clothes by car , and meet them in Italy . On the Berg Isel , as he waited for the others , he would memorize that map which Anni had given him , and compare it with his own . He felt safe enough , partly because of the number of people on the streets , partly because von Aschenhausen would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and von Aschenhausen was with Frances . The German was playing a deep and subtle game . If he had taken Frances to Dreikirchen , it was because her arrest must be unofficial until he had got the information from her which would help him to retrieve his failure . Frances knew enough to compensate him for the escape of Smith , and even that might be made temporary , if Frances could be persuaded . If Frances could be persuaded . The journey to the Berg Isel , although dull and safe enough , was one which Richard would never forget.  |p285VAN  CORTLANDT AND THORNLEY made their way as quicklyas they could through the crowd . They stopped twice : once to buy some biscuits and chocolate , and once to buy oranges . Van Cortlandt already had some brandy . In this matter-of-fact way , they quietly discussed their plans as they walked along to van Cortlandt 's hotel . Thornley , with unexpected pessimism , had not unpacked his bag and in any case he always traveled lightly . Van Cortlandt , althoughmost of his belongings always remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds and ends to clear up in his room . So it was Thornley who would have the job of phoning van Cortlandt 's broadcasting friend and of telling him the time they would meet him . 1 le already knew the place where they were to exchange cars . Van Cortlandt had thought that out , this morning . Thornley was also to telephoneCook 's agent , and have him collect van Cortlandt 's heavier luggage , with the directions that it was to be sent on to Geneva . Van Cortlandt was quite philosophic about it all . " It was coming , " he said . " I 've got to the stage when I ca n't write at all . I 've developed a sort of censorphobia . Every word I get down begins to look as if it wo n't get through anyway . And it 's about time I changed my beat . If there are any surprises coming in the world 's history , it wo n't be from this direction . They are all set for Poland.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
