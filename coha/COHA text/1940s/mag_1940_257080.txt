Bright &; early one morning last week Citizen Sam Jones got up , piled his family into an automobile , and rode through the downtown section of Baton Rouge . Ahead of him sputtered motorcycle police , behind him came the Lieutenant Governor-elect of Louisiana , the Attorney General-elect , many another bigwig , State University cadets . Crowds cheered , bands played themselves red in the face . <P> <P> Out to the Louisiana State University stadium ( built by Huey Long ) rode smiling Citizen Jones . Solemn-faced , he put his hand on a Bible opened to Exodus , pointed a finger at the Commandment which says , " Thou Shalt not Steal , " raised his other hand and took the oath as Governor of Louisiana . At that , 50,000 people applauded , fell upon 1.000 barbecued beeves , 130,000 foot-long sandwiches , downed gallons of lemonade . <P> Gone , they hoped , and gone forever , were the days of political plunder that under the Longs and the Long machine had almost wrecked the State . Longsters had called Sam Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week perfume hawkers yelled : " Here y'are-dip in it-wash in it and win . Sam Jones sweet smellin ' perfume . Get like sweet smellin ' Sam , that Governor man . " For the first time in twelve years , Louisiana smelled sweet .
