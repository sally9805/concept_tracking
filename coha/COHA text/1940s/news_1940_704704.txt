txt Sacrifice for Larger Gain Isolation Regarded as Short-Sighted Policy for Us in Some Cases To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : There can be no doubt that most Americans are devoted to the cause of peace . Some of us who believe that the maximum of peace and order can only be obtained by international cooperation and by some sacrifice of immediate advantages , real or imaginary , for the sake of larger good in the future , are accused of wanting to involve this country in war . That is not a fair charge ; we do not impute any such desire to our opponents in this discussion , though their isolationist stand and their suspicion of other peace-loving countries keep us in constant danger of war . It will be more difficult for us to remain at peace if wars go on in other parts of the world , and if we continue to prefer international anarchy to helping in the organization of peace . It is possible that peace , like happiness , can not be found if we make that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may not be wholly a coincidence that from 1914 to 1917 our policy was , above all , to keep out of war , and that we subsequently found ourselves involved in the European conflict . So Chamberlain was applauded in September , 1938 , for keeping Britain out of war , only to be engaged less than a year later in a desperate struggle with Germany . The Scandinavian countries , for the sake of peace , disavowed a few years ago such vague obligations as still bound them to cooperative efforts against aggression , under the covenant of the League of Nations . That primary devotion to neutrality and peace has not saved them from war . A post hoc propter hoc argument like this is/not sufficient to prove the point , but such a startling sequence does justify thoughtful reflection . What Might Have Been We can not help thinking what might have resulted if Britain and France had shown more courage in dealing with the first threats to peace in Manchuria and Abyssinia . We have criticized those nations and the League for their failures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of too remote concern to justify resolute intervention , is the same as ours before the present European war broke , and even now . In our internal affairs we do not believe that peace and order can be maintained unless we organize beforehand , pay taxes to support police , maintain courts with compulsory jurisdiction , and accept our individual responsibility to back up those institutions in emergencies . There is no rational basis for the belief that world peace can be had on cheaper terms , now that the world has so shrunk that the most remote parts of the earth can he reached in a shorter time than it once took to travel from Maine to Georgia , and when information passes instantaneously round the world . We can not depend on establishing order simply by disarming and creating a general atmosphere of good-will . If even a small unscrupulous minority remain unconverted it can terrorize the world community as a single dog can worry a whole flock of sheep . The Boston police strike gives food for thought . The majority of Bostonians were reasonably peaceful before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was off duty a few hoodlums were enough to create intolerable disorder . The time has not yet come when Americans are prepared to adopt the sheep as their national emblem . Opposition in Congress Yet with all these facts known , many of our most ardent peace advocates in Congress and outside are opposed to sharing in international organization ; they oppose membership in a World Court , and they will approve arbitration treaties only when they are deprived of all binding power . They are so obsessed by fears that they are willing to continue supplying essential war materials to nations which they know are using what we supply to invade friendly and inoffensive countries , in violation of the spirit if not the letter of our treaty obligations . At home we know that we can not build peace by insisting on treating the bandit and his victim alike , or by making profits from selling to the outlaw what he needs for his adventures . That principle will never work any better in international affairs than it does at home . It is well to be concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not forget the interests of our little boys and our grandchildren , of whom we think so little when we are afraid to stand boldly for justice in international affairs . They should be just as dear to us , but they have little hope for the future so long as we refuse to do what is right for fear of immediate consequences , as Chamberlain feared when he bought eleven months of peace by sacrificing the Czech-Slovak Republic , Choice Becomes Harder The longer we wait , the more fearful becomes the choice that we have to make . There was a time after the World War when there seemed to be a chance that by sharing boldly in the councils of the world and reducing our claims for repayment of debts we might perhaps increase the chances for peace at little real cost to ourselves . Any one who has heard Chancellor Bruening speak of the helpful influence of American observers at meetings when they were present , and of the harder conditions when they were absent , can not help wondering whether our isolationists do not bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than even Hitler , Mussolini and the Japanese Army . Before the war broke out last Summer President Roosevelt was eager to lift the arms embargo , no doubt hoping that such a gesture would give Hitler pause , as an evidence of where American sympathies lay . That might not have been enough ; perhaps more resolute diplomatic intervention would have been necessary at that stage , but our isolationists were unwilling to take even that little step , thinking they could read the future better than the President . It may be that now generous help in money and materials would be enough to turn the tide definitely in favor of Britain , France , Norway , Poland and Czecho-Slovakia , and so end the menace that Nazi Germany constitutes to the whole world . If we continue to refuse aid in such mild forms as finance and shipping , the time may come when we shall have to face the choice between war and a position of intolerable humiliation and insecurity . That our isolationists should at the same time oppose cooperative efforts to maintain peace and attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-sufficiency alone makes necessary is the height of unreason . The United States today commands about a third of the industrial resources of the world and a navy second to none . It is inevitable that its influence , whether for anarchy or organized security in the world , should have an almost decisive weight . For twenty years , owing mainly to the veto power possessed by a minority of the Senate , our weight has been thrown with that of the aggressor nations against concerted efforts for peace . It is impossible to view this record without deep sadness and shame when we look at the world today . If we are ever involved in war , there will be many Americans who will hold the well-meaning but misguided pacifists and isolationists of this country responsible for the young men who will then have to die . ROGER S. GREENE . Washington , April 27 , 1940 . Big Warships Preferred Forced On Board Battleship , Writer Would Choose 70,000-Tonner To THE EDITOR OF THE NEw YORE TIMES : In your editorial on super-ships you state that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single hull would seem to he considerably less desirable than the construction of two smaller vessels . " Despite your conclusion , there is something to be said in favor of the large ship of , say , 70,000 tons . The primary function of the battleship is to carry guns and to he able to operate them efficiently . Given two well-designed ships , one of 35,000 tons and the other of 70,000 tons , the larger vessel would be much the steadier in a seaway , and therefore would provide a much steadier gun platform . Assuming the cubic capacity of each water-tight compartment to be approximately the same in each ship , it is obvious that the larger vessel could and would be divided into many more such compartments , and therefore will be better protected against sinking as a result of shell fire , torpedo , aerial attack or other cause . Farther on in your article you complain of the terrific cost of such large vessels . Using your own figure of $2,000 a ton , this is slightly less than $1 a pound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . After all , what does it matter ? The navy , should be provided with anything it needs to enable it to meet its responsibilities , regardless of cost . If it were necessary for me to be on hoard a battleship in action , I must say that I would much prefer to be on the larger ship , and in my opinion so would the author of your leading article .

In your editorial of today you censure the Mayor for suggesting economy by starting water boiling by using hot water from the tap . What 's wrong about that ? Not alone ' have I been doing this for years but I use it straight for drinking before breakfast , adding a bit of lemon . I am more than 60 years old and my health is perfect . So you can see it has had no deleterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as President is endangered , as you suggest , because of this apparent error , I can assure housewives that it is really just one more reason ' for admiring his wide knowledge on so many subjects rather than questioning his judgment . C. Daviesos . New York , May 2 , 1940.  --   - -  To THE EDITOR OF THE NEw YORK TIMES : Our Mayor 's advice is usually helpful and healthful . However , his culinary pointer given April 30 to Brooklyn housewives about using water from the hot-water supply to save time in boiling seems to me to be rather unsound counsel . Such water is usually heated in uncoated copper coils and there is therefore danger of copper poisoning resulting in liver and allied ailments . It is not wise to advise efficiency at the expense of health . Morons NEwsiser . Brooklyn , May 1 , 1940 . Plaint Made From Flushing To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIDIES : I am following the war very carefully , appraising the merits of the various anti-aircraft guns . When I determine the best type , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my home . Then , those transports from La Guardia Field had better watch out . People who live on the railroad tracks are in heaven ? no Clipper ships can graze their chimneys . At 3 in the morning 2,400-horsepower is no lullaby . Why do they call them sleeper planes ? I hope further research is sabotaged . Can you imagine the plight of Flushingites if planes continue to grow bigger and better ? MELVIN SCII WEITzEk . Flushing , N. Y. , May 2 , 1940 . Discrimination Resented Preference of Employers for College Graduates Called Undemocratic To THE EDITOR OF TILE New YORK TIMES : There appeared a few days ago a letter in which the writer complained of discrimination in employment opportunities against those who had experience and ability but who did not have college degrees . It is apparent that this has been the trend , both in private industry and in public service . Indeed , in the various civil service systems more and more stress is being laid on the prerequisite of academic training and less on experience and demonstrated ability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically barred from competing even ill so-called competitive examinations . This is undemocratic and hardly in keeping with the spirit of a true merit system . A system of public education which includes the so-called higher education and covers an attendance period of from sixteen to eighteen years is supported by all the people , the taxpayers . The purpose of this system is to instruct young people and to prepare them for their real education in life . Its purpose is not to erect an artificial harrier to employment possibilities for some of the people by making sixteen years of attendance at formal institutions an arbitrary prerequisite , regardless of an individual 's native ability and experience . This sort of thing is not fair , sound or sensible , and works a hardship 011 many of the people who support public education , particularly those of outstanding ability and self-reliance who seek learning for its own sake and not for the sake of receiving credit . on paper . There are too many artificial barriers to employment today , and the arbitrary insistence on the college degree by many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability and experience , is one of them . It is an additional price which the public must pay for the elaborate extension of our system of public education , which now covers practically every field . And the false assumption is that there can be no kind of education except formal education . This attitude is something in the nature of a paradox . because modern education is supposed to he devoted to the idea of learning by doing . A recent civil service announcement gave as a requirement completion of a certain number of semester hours in a subject . I happen to know of individuals who had practical experience in the subject , but who had never taken courses in it or received college credit for it , who were declared ineligible to compete for positions in which a knowledge of the subject was necessary . These persons were experts in the line , but they were not permitted to compete with persons who had merely studied the subject in college . It is little wonder that ninny persons employed in Federal agencies are attending classes in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But why do they have to learn at the taxpayers ' expense ? It must be because persons qualified in advance by experience for the kind of work they are doing are not permitted to compete in this so-called merit system . And if private industry is wise it will not follow this example of the " raising " of the . standards . C. O'BRIEN . Rosendale , N. Y. , May 2 , 1940 . Subway Benefits Analyzed To THE EDITOR or THE NEw YoRk Times : In a letter to Tile sirs , G. J. Brown argues for a higher subway fare . His contention rests on the single thesis I hat those who benefit by city services " should be assessed directly " for the entire cost involved , wherever it I. possible to directly allocate such costs among the individual users . This widely held opinion will bear closer analysis . Are the subway riders the only persons who benefit by the subway services ? Obviously not , for subways diffuse many inappropriable benefits within a city besides those directly enjoyed by the subway rider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the $17,000,000 assessed property valuation for New York City is a result of the services performed by our subway system . Further , the present economic and social development of the city owes much to our network of subways . Is it not advisable , therefore , from Mr. Brown 's point of view , to finance a portion of the subway 's cost of operation from the city 's general tax fund ? To be sure the subway user , in payment for his ride , should bear t he major portion of the expenses incurred in the operation of the subway . This he does , in fact , with the present 5-cent fare . Those who desire higher subway fares can not validly lest their argument on the thesis that all public enterprises should cover the entire cost of their service in the price . This thesis is especially weak when applied to the subway enterprise in New York City . LEO FISHMAN . Brooklyn , May 1 , 1940 . Pullman Car Technique To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : F. D. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berths are invariably made up head forward , feeling that this may cause broken necks when the momentum drives the sleeper forward in a head-on collision . It is to prevent the very danger he refers to that the berths are made this way . Were berths made up feet first , in case of a head-on collision the feet would drive against the hoard and , the legs being bound down by the bed clothing , the upper part of the body would be thrown up against the upper berth or top of the car with great force . In which case the danger of the neck being broken would be infinitely greater . Where the berth is made up head first , in a collision the shoulders and head are ( 1 ; ; ; ; ven into the mattress and pillow rather I:mn the head-board , and the feet and legs are held down by the bed clothing , which greatly minimizes the danger of a broken neck .
