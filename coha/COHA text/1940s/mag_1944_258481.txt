Tom Dewey 's automobile reached Pawling Village , 105 miles from Albany , at 4 p.m. , exactly on schedule . Pawling was ready , too . The wood-pillared front porch of the 58-year-old Dutcher Hotel was bunting-draped . In the tree-shaded park behind it-which looks like all U.S. village parks from Idaho to Georgia-1,000 people crowded behind the roped-off lanes . Men , coatless on the hot day , women in summer frocks and bare legs , young girls in pinafores and bobby socks , waited for a look at their famous neighbor , the man who owns the 486-acre Dapplemere place two miles outside of town . <P> Even the town 's No. i Democrat , who is also cashier of the bank , was in the crowd . So was Tom Dewey 's " citified " neighbor , Commentator Lowell Thomas . Thomas introduced the Governor to the friendly small-town audience , with folksy references to Dewey gadding off to big cities like Chicago when his hay needed putting in . Thomas said he had put his own hay in that very morning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dewey farm . Dewey replied , with characteristic heavy jocularity , that if so , it was the first work Lowell Thomas had done in 21 years . Commented Scripps-Howard 's veteran Tom Stokes : " It was a little hard to imagine either one with a straw lying honestly behind one ear . " <P> Farmyard . But Tom Dewey was not asking anyone to see a straw behind his ear . Next day , when photographers snapped and clicked all over Dapplemere , Dewey firmly set his usual limitations , for Candidate Dewey is very much aware of what the camera has done to U.S. politicos . He or his family would don no overalls , feed no chicks , milk no cows , pitch no hay . In white shirt , neat grey trousers , and brown tie carefully in place though the temperature was 90 , Dewey for three hours patiently posed for shots showing him only as a spectator-farmer . Typical authorized shot : Dewey standing by , with hands in his pockets , while a farm assistant fed the chickens . Then Dewey led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 90 dairy cattle are kept ; the boys ' Victory garden ; the cherry orchard , and the 150-year-old colonial house , with its twelve rooms and four baths , which Dewey bought Oct. 16 , 1939 for $30,000 . <P> Governor Dewey had already warned his growing assemblage of press followers that they need come down to Pawling just this once : henceforth , when he traveled to Pawling for weekends , there would be no news . <P> Front Porch . Tom Dewey had resolved that , if he must be in the spotlight , he would decide when it was to be turned on &; off . Right now he was content to be a " front-porch " candidate . Last week he : <P> Dined in Albany with Senator Arthur Vandenberg , the phrasemaker of Mackinac ; four days later saw Vermont 's internationalist Senator Warren R. Austin . Both Senators said they saw eye-to-eye with Dewey on foreign policy . <P> Received his first state delegation : Massachusetts ' Governor Leverett Saltonstall and Willkieite Senator Sinclair Weeks . When newsmen asked if they would discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply and then added briskly : " That is my entire answer to your question . "
