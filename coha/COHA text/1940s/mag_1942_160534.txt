Astatic Microphone Laboratory , Inc. ( of Youngstown , Ohio ) was puzzled when Du Pont gave it orders , with a high Government priority , for numbers of sensitive phonograph pickups . Astatic Microphone was still more surprised to find out that Du Pont engineers were putting the phonograph needles not on phonograph records but against factory fences , relaying the wires ' vibrations to amplifiers . So Asiatic 's engineers redesigned their pickups to make them more compact and weatherproof . Du Pont last fortnight announced the result : fences ( equipped with five pickups to the mile ) which can catch a wren 's song or the sighing wind , and relay the sounds to a watchman five miles away . These pastoral effects , however , are usually filtered out ; what the pickups are after are such contact noises as climbing , tunneling , wire-snipping and other signs of sabotage and trespass . Result : as good a watch in fog , blackout , darkness and storm as could be maintained by guards standing elbow to elbow .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
