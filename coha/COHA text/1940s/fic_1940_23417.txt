VOLUME 181 NOVEMBER 1940 Harpers CY14ffazine THE PILGRIM HAWK A NOVEL IN TWO PARTS  --  PART ONE BY GLENWAY WESCOTT rP E. Cullens were Irish ; but it was in rance that I met them and was able to form an impression of their love and their trouble . They were on their way to a property they had rented in Hungary ; and one afternoon they came to Chancellet to see my great friend Alexandra Henry . That was in May of 1928 or 1929 , before we all returned to America , and she met my brother and married him . Needless to say , the twenties were very different from the thirties , and now the forties have begun . In the twenties it was not unusual to meet foreigners in countries as foreign to them as to you , your peregrination just crossing theirs ; and you did your best to know them in an afternoon or so ; and perhaps you called that little lightning knowledge , friendship . There was a kind of optimistic curiosity in the air . And vagaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the psyche , seemed of the greatest and even importance . Chancellet must be a painful place in the forties , although one of the least changed in France , I suppose , because it is unimportant . As I remember there was a school of what is now romantically called celestial navigation , with a modest flying field and a few hangars , two or three kilometers away , at Pelors ; but if that is in use now the foreigners must have it . In our day , day in and day out , the old Duchesse de Challot and her poor relations and friends in tight coats on wind-broken mounts used to hunt in the forest of Pelors . We could hear their hunting horns which sounded like a picnic of boy sopranos , lost . Meanwhile perhaps there have been anti-aircraft guns for the defense of Paris embedded all amid the earths of foxes ; angry radio stammering in the well-kept branches . Now at least the foxes and the thrushes can come back . The old ex-cabinet minister whose ch  --  teau and little park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a section of the Copyright , 1940 , by Harper &; Brothers .

She or her architect made a mistake in the planning of the ground floor . The dining room and the chief guest-room were on the street , which is also the highway to Orleans and the tourist country of the Loire ; so that the reckless French traffic practically brushed the walls , and heavy trucks alarmed one all night . Not only Alex 's bedroom but the kitchen and pantry opened into the spacious and quiet garden . This delighted the new servants whom Alex had brought up from Morocco , a romantic pair named Jean and Eva . They promptly took a far corner of it under some plane trees for their own use ; and all spring they passed every spare moment there , quarreling and occasionally weeping during the day , but like clockwork making peace and sealing it with kisses in the twilight or moonlight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants ' quarters because , that afternoon of the Culiens ' visit , I went to speak to Jean and happened to look out the kitchen window and saw Cullen in the garden , futilely giving way to his awful jealousy , emancipated from love for a few minutes . There had been no mention of their coming , or perhaps I had forgotten it . I heard the doorbell ring , then ring again . Jean and Eva must have been outdoors or napping . Alex had put through a telephone call to London upon some little annoying matter of business , and wished not to be disturbed . So I went to the door ; and there was the long dark Daimler entirely occupying the cobbled space between the house and the highway , and there stood the Irishman about to ring a third time . " Oh , how d' ya do , is this Miss Henry 's house , my name 's Cullen , " he said ; and turned to help Mrs. Cullen out of the car , which was a delicate operation , for she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dapper young chauffeur also helped . She was dressed with extreme eleganceand she wore the highest heels I ever saw , on which , with one solicitous male at each elbow , she stumbled across the ancient cobblestones , the bird swaying a little and hunching its wings to steady itself . I told them my name , and they repeated it after me and shook hands with a somewhat grand and vague affability . " I brought my hawk , " Mrs. Cullen unnecessarily announced . " She 's new . I thought Alex would n't mind . And I hope you too , " she added and paused a moment , with bright eyes to flatter me just in case I felt entitled to authority of some sort in Alex 's house , " I hope you wo n't mind . " She had no way of knowing who or what I was : casual caller or one of Alex 's kinsmen or perhaps a sweetheart . Her eyes were a crystal blue , unmistakably Irish ; and she was unmistakable in other ways too , in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make-up was better than you would have expected of a lady falconer ; still you could see that her skin was naturally downy and her snub nose tended to be pink . There was also a crookedness , particularly in the alignment of her nostrils and her voluble little lips . How rare pulchritude is among the Irish , I said to myself ; therefore what a trouble is made when it does appear : Emer and Deirdre , Mrs. O'Shea and Mrs. McBride . Then my glance fell upon Mrs. Cullen 's snowy dimpled fingers , with a considerable diamond on one , a star sapphire on another . Between her sleeve and the rough gauntlet to which the falcon clung , her wrist showed like a bit of Easter lily ; and her ankle was a match for it , perfectly straight in a mere glimmer of stocking . No doubt these fine points were enough to entitle her to a certain enchantment and disturbance of the opposite sex : her husband for one . Meanwhile Jean had come running in a fine embarrassment , buttoning his white jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrival of her guests and to guide their chauffeur to the garage , while IMPOINIO I tried to usher them into the living room . But Mrs. Cullen went on explaining the hawk . " Her name 's Lucy . Do n't you think she 's sweet ? She 's Scottish ; I 've only had her five or six weeks . A gamekeeper near Inverness trapped her , but she 's all right , only one toe bent in the trap . D' you see , this toe ? " She paused on the threshold and held up the gloved hand and wrist on which Lucy perched , and I saw , gripping the rugged and stained leather , one sharp talon that did not grip straight . The stain on the leather was dried blood . " I call her Lucy because my old father used to make me read Scott to him in the winter whenever the weather got too beastly to hunt . I thought Alex would like to see her . " " We had to bring her anyway , " her husband loudly chimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave her in the hotel . She frightens the chambermaids , and they scream and weep . I have to give immense tips . " He was a large man , not really fat but with bulk and softness irregularly here and there , not so much in the middle as up and down his back , all around his head , in his hands . His British complexion suggested eating and drinking rather than hunting and shooting ; certainly nothing about him suggested hawking . His hazel eyes were a little bloodshot , wavering golden now and then ; and he had a way of opening and shutting his lips , like an unsympathetic pout , or a dispirited kiss , under the tufts of his mustache . We were about to sit down in the living room when they both noticed it , and evidently felt obliged to comment . " What a splendid room , splendid , " they said ; " most unusual and modern and comfortable . " It was not splendid , but it was very large : the entire former stable with the hayloft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old chestnut rafters gothically pointing up twenty-five or thirty feet ; the woodwork darkly waxed and the walls painted white . It reminded me of a village church . Atregular intervals all round hung certain modern pictures with only blunt rudimentary drawing and overflowing color , like stained glass . But on as fine a day as this , modern art was dimmed and dwarfed by the view of the garden and the park beyond it ; Alex 's architect having removed almost a third of the wall on that side and put in two great panes of plate glass . Mrs. Cullen tripped over to this great window and courteously exclaimed once more : " Splendid garden . What luck to have a pond ! " It was what the French call an English garden ; no formal flower beds  --  a few blossoms amid the grass , paths along the water , and shrubs flourishing , in the muffled brilliance of late May . The characteristic Seine-etOise sky , foamy cloud and weak blue , lay at our feet also , daubed in a soft copy on the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draped in a slightly different shade of the same ecstatic color . But as Mrs. Cullen stood facing all this I had an impression of indifference and mere courtesy ; her look did not take in much . A little narrow frown , an efficient survey , only to discover if there was anything in it for her personally ; and there was not . In a moment the light eyelashes began to flutter again , and the blue pupils loosened , merely sparkling . Her prolonged and expressive looks were all for her husband or her hawk . Now what seeing the garden chiefly reminded her of was that the hawk could not see : its entire head except the beak encased in its plumed Dutch hood . " Poor Lucy , blind as a bat , " she murmured ; and very deftly , taking one drawstring in her teeth and the other between thumb and forefinger of her right hand , she unhooded it . It also frowned and stared circularly at the room and blinked at the window . Then it opened out and rearranged the whitish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between its tethered legs ; smoothed its cheek against its powerful shoulder . Mrs. Cullen paced up and down , evi-dently trying to decide which armchair would suit her and Lucy best . Then Alex came in from her long-distance business , with apologies for not welcoming them at once . They replied with another round of compliments upon the house and garden , and there was a new introduction of the falcon . " Lucy , for Lucy Ashton , Lucy of Lammermoor , " Mrs. Cullen explained . " Do n't you remember her song ? Easy lire and quiet die , Vacant hand and heart and eye . " To my amusement Cullen hummed a few notes of the Mad Scene from " Lucia " in a manly Irish treble . His wife hushed him by murmuring his name , which was Larry ; and went on informing Alex that they were at the Plaza-Honor6 , busy shopping in Paris , eager to leave for Hungary via Strasbourg on the morrow . I was impatient for them to cease this small talk and be seated , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to ask certain questions . At last Mrs. Cullen requested a straight chair , which I brought from the dining room . I was much impressed by Alex 's enthusiasm during this first part of the Cullens ' visit . It reminded me that she must be lonely here in France with only myself and my cousin and a few other friends rather like us . She had spent a number of years in Scotland with her father , and in Morocco , and journeying around the Orient ; and in London too the acquaintances of her girlhood had been outdoor people like these two , self-centered but without any introspection , strenuous but emotionally idle . It was a type of humanity that she no longer quite respected or trusted , but evidently still enjoyed . Their enthusiasm about themselves and all that exactly appertained to them , always overflowing , coolly playing and bubbling over in mild agitation like a fountain , held your attention and mirrored itself in your mind ; little by little you began to bubble with it . One of Alex 's obvious characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chieflyfear of arousing or authorizing others ' inquiry about herself . Perhaps selfishness reassured her and made her Tess shy . In any case , that afternoon she eagerly asked questions , including some that I had in mind ; and Mrs. Cullen was charmed to answer ; and Cullen was charmed to listen and give back his approximate echoes . Thus an odd kind of compatibility was established , in which I too gradually let myself be included , somewhat to my surprise . For one thing , the bird charmed me so that nothing else mattered much . And it served as an embodiment or emblem for me of all the truly interesting subjects of conversation that these very sociable , traveling , sporting people leave out as a rule : illness , poverty , sex , religion , art . Whenever I began to be bored , a solemn glance of its maniacal eyes helped me to stop listening and to think concentratedly of myself instead , or for myself . Furthermore the Cullens began to puzzle me ; to charm me in that sense . Whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I often begin in the way of a vexed , intense superficiality . And indeed they were mere male and female of that species of well-to-do British which haunts the entire world with excess of energy and sedate manner . They were self-absorbed , coldly gregarious , mere passers of time . But nothing about them was authentically sedate or even peaceful . There Cullen plumply sat in Alex 's softest armchair , his legs more widely spread or loosely crossed than you would expect of a conventional gentleman ; licking his lips under his fringy mustache ; evidently thinking of his dinner ; interrupting his wife 's conversation at regular intervals as if that were his life work . Yet he seemed to be constantly fighting against some strange feeling , and to be somehow outwitted by it . Whenever he spoke , his wife smiled or kindly tilted her head toward him . This , I felt , was chiefly good breeding on her part ; many of his remarks , and especially his tone of voice , seemed unpleasant . But between remarks , in her general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . And during the loving fuss she made over the great bird on her arm she kept shifting her eyes in his direction , imploring him to try to like it too . It might have been a baby , and he a lover ; or was it the other way round ? Alex expressed surprise that they should willingly leave Ireland at this lovely time of year . Mrs. Cullen answered that , in season or out , there was nothing much to do in Ireland except hunt . " And our terrible sons pinch our hunters when they come home . We ca n't afford to keep enough for them . I ca n't bear a horse that others have been riding . " She also alluded mildly to the diminishment of the old quiet kind of fortune like theirs . The banshee in the draughty corridor or the weedy hedge crying not the deaths of relatives , but increase of taxes , decrease of rents and investments . . . Indeed they still appeared rich , in hand-woven silk with diamonds , in tweed as soft as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budapest in a Daimler . But all that in fact is cheaper than an old country house full of guests , and the requisite stable and kennel and larder and cellar , and servants enough . Having closed Cullen Hall , Mrs. Cullen pointed out , they were in a position to accept invitations half the year ; and the Continent was cheap . Evidently her telling us this vexed Cullen . He warmly informed us that one of his neighbors , a drunken idiot anyway , had sold everything that the entail permitted , and two of his cousins were obliged to rent ; and so it went all over the British Isles . Their own circumstances were neither discreditable nor hopeless . There were still certain inheritances due them , on his side , not Mrs. Cullen 's . His sons might be considered grown men , except by their mother ; but they were still engaged in that great postponement , education , which is expensive . His brother and sister were happy to have them during their long vacations ; but as a rule theypreferred to loiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too old to dismiss anyway ; and they hunted with the neighbors . It is easy for youngsters to get on with new people , even such as the latest in their county , a manufacturing peer named Bild , a Jew ; not at all easy for him . Mrs. Cullen said a word in defense of Lord Bild . Thank heaven it was he who had bought the estate adjoining Cullen Hall , on their youngsters ' account especially . Although of common Germanic origin he was very strict about manners and sportsmanship and keeping fit ; more so than they were . Neighborly influence is like education ; the best teachers belong to the races and classes which have been learning themselves just lately . Now Cullen had risen and was standing at his wife 's elbow , shaking his finger at the falcon teasingly . I thought that the bird 's great eyes showed only a slight natural bewilderment ; whereas a slow sneer came over his face and he turned pale . It was the first revelation I had of the interesting fact that he hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to have an excuse to retaliate , I thought ; and I imagined him picking up a chair or a coffee table and going at her with smashing blows . What a difference there is between animals and humans ! Lucy no doubt would be disgustingly fierce when her time came ; but meanwhile sat at her case in abeyance . Whereas humanity is histrionic , and must prepare and practice every stroke of passion ; so half our life is a vague and stormy make-believe . Mrs. Cullen merely looked up at her husband and said in a velvety tone , " The trouble with Ireland , from my point of view , is that they do n't like our having a falcon . Naturally Lord Bild disapproves ; but I do n't mind him . He 's so unsure of himself ; he 's a Jew furthermore ; you can scarcely expect him to live and let live . But our other neighbors and the family are almost as tiresome . " He thrust the teasing hand in his pocket and returned to his armchair . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which pretends to be joking . Or perhaps it pleased her to break off the subject of their Irish circumstances and worldly situation and to resume the dear theme of hawk , which meant all the world to her . The summer before , she told us , an old Hungarian had sold her a trained tierce/ . " I took him with me last winter when we stayed with some pleasant Americans in Scotland . There 's a bad ailment called croaks , and he caught that and died . They had installed their American heating , which I think makes an old house damp ; do n't you ? Then their gamekeeper trapped Lucy and gave her to me . Was n't that lucky ? I 've always wanted a real falcon , a haggard , to man and train myself . " In strict terminology of the sport , she explained , only a female is called a falcon ; and a haggard is one that has already hunted on her own account , that is , at least a year old when caught . Except for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect example of her species , Falco peregrinus , pilgrim hawk . Her body was as Iong as her mistress 's arm ; the wing feathers in repose a little too long , slung across her back like a folded tent . Her back was an indefinable hue of iron ; only a slight patine of the ruddiness of youth still shone on it . Her luxurious breast was white , with little tabs or tassels of chestnut . Out of tasseled pantaloons her legs came down straight to the perch with no apparent flesh on them , enameled a greenish yellow . But her chief beauty was that of expression . In a way it was like a little flame ; it caught and compelled your attention like that , although it did not flicker and there was nothing bright about it nor any warmth in it . It is a look that men sometimes have ; men of great energy whose appetite or vocation has kept them absorbed every instant all their lives . They may be good men butthey are often mistaken for evil men , and vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes , not black but funereally brown , and extravagantly large , set deep in her flattened head . On each side of the upper beak there was a little tooth or tusk . Mrs. Cullen explained that the able bird in the prime of life uses this to snap the spinal cord of its quarry , which is the most merciful death in nature . It reminded me of the hooked gloves which our farmers wear to husk corn ; and so in fact , I thought , it must work : the falcon in the sky like a large angelic hand , stripping the meat of pigeon or partridge out of its feathers , the soul out of its throat . I think Mrs. Cullen was the most talkative woman I ever met ; and it was hawk , hawk , all afternoon . A good many inhabitants of the British Isles arc hell-bent all their lives upon killing some wild animal somehow , and naturally are keen about the domestic animals which assist them . Others , who know all about human nature , nevertheless prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of conversational valor . Mrs. Cullen 's enthusiasm was nothing like that , and it probably would have annoyed or alarmed the majority of her compatriots . As it seemed to me after listening a while , she felt welling up in her mind some peculiar imagination , or some trouble impossible to ignore , which she tried to relieve by talking , with a kind of continuous double meaning . I think she would never have admitted the duplicity , and perhaps could not have expressed herself in plain terms . People as a rule do mean much more than they understand . She informed us , for example , that in a state of nature hawks rarely die of disease ; they starve to death . Their eyesight fails ; some of their flight feathers break off or fall out ; and their talons get dull or broken . They cease to be able to judge what quarry is worth flying at ; or their flight slows up so that even the likely quarry gets away . Or , because they have lost weight , the victim is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they have clutched it , they can not hang on long enough to kill . Day after day they make fools of themselves . Then they have to.depend upon very young birds or sick birds , or little animals on the ground , which are the hardest of all to see ; and in any case there are not enough of these easy conquests to keep them in flesh . The hungrier they get , the more wearily and weakly they hunt . And the weaker they get , the more often they go hungry , in a miserable confusion of cause and effect . Finally what appears to be shame and morbid discouragement overcomes them . They simply sit on the rocks or in a tree somewhere waiting to die , as you might say philosophically , letting themselves die . " I met a man on the staff of our great madhouse in Dublin last year , " Mrs. Cullen added . " I was curious to see what it was like ; so he took me with him one afternoon on a tour of inspection . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The lethargically mad , sitting with their hands in their Iaps , imaginarily exhausted , unable to speak above a whisper , with burning but unfocusable eyes , unable to concentrate . . Cullen cleared his throat boisterously , perhaps to protest against the curiosity of women or against this folly of reading meaning into the ways of mere birds . Falconers believe that hunger must be worse for falcons than for other birds and animals , Mrs. Cullen said . It maddens them , with a soreness in every feather ; an unrelievable itching in their awful feet ; a bloody lump in their throats , with the light plumage wrapped loose around like a bandage . This painful greed , sick single-mindedness , makes it possible to tame them and to perfect the extraordinary technique of falconry , which is more than any other bird can learn . You hear it in their cry  --  aik , aik  --  as Mrs. Cullen then imitated it for us , ache , ache ? a small flat scream with a bubbling or gargling undertone , as if their mouthswere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never feel anything like it . " " But Madeleine , Madeleine , we 're never hungry , " her husband protested with a chuckle in which there was great satisfaction . " How can we tell ? " She begged him not to be silly . She had known people who had starved , Irish republicans hiding from the Black and Tans , Germans in 1922 , and had inquired of them ; and they had described it as rather a soft , cool , drowsy feeling . I wondered about this . Although I had been a poor boy , on a Wisconsin farm and in a slum in Chicago and in Germany in 1922 , I could not recollect any exact sensation of hunger , that is to say , hunger of the stomach . And I thought  --  as the relatively well-fed do think  --  of the other human hungers , mental and sentimental and so on . For example , my own undertaking in early manhood to be a literary artist . No one warned me that I really did not have talent enough . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hot and nerve-racking ; and it would get worse as I grew older . The unsuccessful artist also ends in an apathy , too proud and vexed to fly again , waiting upon withheld inspiration , bored to death . . . . Naturally I did not speak of this to Alex and the Cullen . It seemed rude and somehow abnormal even to be thinking of it , while they sat exchanging information about real life , really starving nations and greedy species of birds . Whereupon our present bird mantled , that is , stood a moment on one leg , shook the other leg and wing downward , and spread that half of her plumage in a long fan , gazing at me , blinking or winking at me . But because my writing had gone badly all spring I could not bear to give her more than a passing thought with reference to that . I began to think of her as an image of amorous desire instead . That is the great relief of weariness of work in any case ; the natural consolation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling about each other suggested it to me . No doubt art is too exceptional to be worth talking about ; but sex is not . At least in good countries such as France and the United States during prosperous periods like the twenties , it must be the keenest of all appetites for a majority of men most of their lives . And highly sexed men , unless they give in and get married and stay married , more or less starve to death . I myself was still young then and I had been lucky in love . But little early quarrels and failures warn one ; and in the confidences of friends and in gossip about other men , one discovers the vague beastly shape of what to expect . Life goes on and on after one 's luck has run out . Youthfulness persists , alas , long after one has ceased to be young . Love-life goes on indefinitely , with Iess and less likelihood of being loved , less and less ability to love , and the stomach-ache of love still as sharp as ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civilized human beings have learned how to avoid literal starvation and the fear of death and real enslavement ; so at least it seemed in the twenties . They have this kind of thing instead : fear of old age , loss of charm , lack of love . Therefore I caught myself gazing at my young unmarried Alex anxiously , sentimentally , and at her Irish guests with idle envy . But the Irish wife 's uneasiness and the husband 's captivated but uncomfortable look reminded me that I was making a false distinction . There is not as much sweet safety in marriage as one hopes . Hunger and its twin , disgust , are in it too ; need and greed ; and passage of time , the punishment . Of course true love and lust are not the same , neither are they inseparable or indistinguishable . Only they reflect and elucidate each other . Looking back upon that afternoon 's talk and thought , I am inclined to hold Mrs. Cullen responsible for this daydreaming of mine , personal worry and exhilaration , which made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman as energetic and attractive as that , the hint of hidden emotion and the sense of double meaning naturally are exciting ; and the excitement leads in one 's own private direction . But as it were in a mirror , looking at myself , I could see something of her character and plight before the circumstances of the afternoon betrayed her . I think that was what she instinctively wanted . Meanwhile she had gone on answering Alex 's questions : something about the craftsmen who outfit falcons , generation after generation of avian haberdashers especially in India , and which bell resounds the clearest through the grass and bushes and breezes , and what hood is least likely to ulcerate the waxen lids and lips ; and something about an ancient Persian text with a thrice-hyphenated title which is still the best handbook of falconry . I wanted to know all this , yet I failed to pay attention , Then Lucy bated , that is , threw herself headlong off the fist . The jesses around her legs and the leash looped through Mrs. Cullen 's fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful sight , like an epileptic fit or an insane fit . There was no possibility of the thongs breaking ; I half-expected her lean bright legs to snap instead . I expected her to scream , aik ! But the only sound was the jingling of her bell and the convulsion of her plumage . The tail feathers and the flight feathers shooting out rigidly , threshed against herself and against her mistress from head to foot . Mrs. Cullen , not the least disconcerted , raised her left arm straight up over her head , and stood up and stood quite still , only turning her face away from the flapping and whipping . Her equanimity impressed me as much as her strength . In a minute Lucy gave up little by little . It was extraordinary : you could see her self-control returning , recurring in one feather after another . Then she hung peacefully like a mere turkey or goose hooked up in a butchershop ; only for an instant . The long wings began again , but in a different exertion : hugging the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip on the gauntlet and she succeeded in pulling herself up again where she belonged . There she stared or glared at us , blinking the rush of blood back out of her embarrassed eyes and pulling her plumage together . With a sigh and a half-smile Mrs. Cullen brought her burdened and shaken arm down , and seated herself again in the straight chair . Some such hopeless attempt to escape , crazy fit of freedom , comes over all domesticated falcons at fairly regular intervals , she explained , especially in their first year or two ; all their lives if they have not been well manned . " They never get over being wild . It 's like malaria or that other intermittent fever , the one you have to be so careful about in the Orient . " Lucy happened to be an unusually frank , active bird , so that you could often tell when her trouble was to be expected ; by a soft repeated tinkle of her bells or a steady pull at one of her jesses . The leather might of course be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , which makes her angry , and everything seems hopeless , " Mrs. Cullen concluded . " She ca n't help it , ca n't bear it . It 's like committing suicide . " " Give me liberty or give me death , ha , ha , " cried Cullen , seeming to expect special applause from us because we were Americans , or perhaps because Alex 's name was Henry like the American who first expressed that sentiment . His wife gave him that look of hers which was the opposite of applause ; and he took it as usual . His hazel eyes stood out like jewels , the tip of his tongue brightened his lips . Meanwhile she was slowly caressing Lucy 's lower plumage and tired feet . She might have been a trained nurse and Lucy her patient , after a bout of illness or craziness . Or she might have been in love and Lucy her beloved , pleasure absent-mindedly ebbing .. . . And every word she uttered added a little to the confused significance . " Some-times I can prevent her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child , and can see its tantrums beginning and distract it somehow . . . . Being stroked like this often does the trick . At first I used a dried pigeon 's wing as you 're supposed to , but this suits Lucy as well . " Idly she went on with it : two dimpled fingers with long tinted nails and heavy rings just brushing the spent feathers , " Or if I notice it in time , I lift her over my head for a moment . She likes to perch as high as possible , so she can look down upon everything around her . I think it must frighten her to see things higher than she is . We 're like that sometimes ourselves , are n't we ? " she added , smiling gently . Time after time her transitions like this  --  from hawk to human , objective to subjective  --  startled me . To be sure , any woman greatly in love must know how a flattery in time saves trouble , how the illusion of superiority counteracts the illusion of inferiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not occurred to me that her love of Cullen was great in that sense : cunning , instructive , curative . Falcons , she informed us , do not breed in captivity . Various attempts have been made to induce them to , but with no success . Thus the entire sport has to start again from scratch for each falconer , whenever he trains a new playmate . Little by little the perfectly wild creature surrenders , individually , in the awful difficulty of hunger . But surrender is all , domestication is all ; they never feel at home . You can carry male and female side by side in the same cadge year in and year out ; nothing happens . They will cease to fight but they stay solitary . Scorn of each other for giving in , or self-scorn , seems to break their hearts . They never build a nest or lay an egg . Not one chick or eyas is ever reared in bondage . There is no real acceptance or inheritance of the state of surrender . Mrs. Cullen mentioned , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which some professionals use in the training of the young wild ones . But even their influence must be in the way of a rationalization of necessary evil , inculcation of vice , making the best of a had bargain . For they too are born in the vacant rocks or uncomfortable trees ; and they too keep sterile . " Like schoolmasters , " crowed Cullen . That appealed to my sense of humor . But Cullen 's smile was a leer if I ever saw one , and evidently embarrassed his wife and Alex , so I kept from smiling . Mrs. Cullen then quoted Buffon 's famous sentence about falcons : " L'individu seul est esclave ; l'espce est libre . " Buffon had been her father 's second-best author , after Scott . Her French accent was incorrect but very pretty . Only the individual hawk is a slave ; the species is free . . . . Then Alex spoke up , in what was a loud voice for her : " Oh , dear , it is the opposite of human beings . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man can hope to free himself , one at a time , and then another , one by one . " " Oh , I dare say , " Mrs. Cullen assented . " Yes , perhaps . " But she smiled patronizingly . Perhaps she was congratulating herself upon knowing a freer and stronger type of humanity than our pampered , subtle , self-questioning American type and so she may have , I suppose : Irish republicans , wild Hungarians with hawks , Germans during their defeat . " But it is true , is n't it ? " Alex insisted . " The man who really loves freedom is the exception . " " Oh , quite . How right you are , " our lady falconer dubiously murmured . But her husband disagreed . " No , Alex ! What a disgusting idea ! Love of liberty is the deepest instinct we have  --  if you will excuse my saying so . " We silently considered this for a moment ; the three of us , it seemed , regretfully . Alex wanted freedom more than anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she might have a lonely life . In any case it would take a better man than Cullen to dispel her young misanthropy . I myself regretted never having been able to decide what to think : how much liberty is a true human motive , and how much is wasteful and foolish ? And for the first time that afternoon Mrs. Cullen gazed at her husband sadly , that is , weakly . She agreed with him , I felt sure . But there are circumstances in which it may be obvious that at least one human being requires freedom ; and you bitterly regret that it is so : because you need to keep that one captive . " Why , hang it all , " Cullen still sputtered , " why , independence is the only thing that is human about hawks . Do n't you agree , Madeleine ? " She slightly turned her back to him and contemplated Alex and me rather unkindly . It was the careful absence of expression , absence of frown , that you see on a clever lecturer 's face when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sadness about it which , if I read it aright , I have often felt myself . She did not want us to take her hawk , her dear subject-matter , her hobby and symbol  --  whatever it meant to her  --  and turn it this way and that to mean what we liked . It was hers and we were spoiling it . Round her eyes and mouth there were lines of that caricatural weariness which is peculiar to those who talk too much . Indeed our sociability as a whole had gone off ; something a little sour and dark had developed in it . We had been sitting there too long . Alex , I fancied , was counting the minutes until they departed . But suddenly she grew hospitable . " You 'll stay to dinner , Madeleine , wo n't you ? Please , Larry , do . I can promise you a good dinner , " she added with an indulgent smile . I wondered whether she had mentioned this invitation to Jean and Eva , and whether the short notice would exasperate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Servants are devils , do n't you know . Mine used to behave madly when extra people turned up at Cullen Hall . " Poor Alex was accustomed to the madness of servants ; but , as she explained , this new couple did not mind surprises . She had found them in Tangier , where the secretary of the pig-sticking club had engaged them to cook in camp for several tentfuls of unmarried members . With only primitive utensils , a few iron kettles and a spit over an out-door fire , and unpredictable guests at all hours , it evidently was child 's play for them , and a welcome opportunity to show off . One afternoon a French general and a party of eight had motored out from the town , and some thoughtless fellow had asked them to stay . Jean had taken a boar killed that morning , and by slicing it thin , rubbing it with certain herbs which grew there underfoot amid the tents , and marinating it in four bottles of brandy , rendered it quite edible by nightfall . Alex was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that sort . So she had hired the proud pair and secured passports for them and embarked them for France and Chancellet . And this , she told Mrs. Cullen , was what she had hired them for . " If we do stay , " Mrs. Cullen said , " my bird will have to be fed , toward six o'clock . " Alex in any case intended to suggest to Jean a dish of pigeons baked with white currants . He would procure them from a neighbor who had an immense old dovecot ; and one could be brought back alive for Lucy . The reminiscence of the brandied wild pig , the prospect of pigeons aux groseilles , charmed Cullen ; you could see the gourmandise shining on his rosy lips . Alex went to the kitchen , and by her comfortable air when she came back I judged that Jean was well disposed . Then she suggested our taking a walk until dinnertime , which also charmed Cullen , though his appetite did not need whetting . " By Jove , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were disappointed to learn that the park was not Alex 's property . It belonged to the nation , along with the little ch  --  teau de Chancellet in the midstof it . Bidou , the illustrious aged ex-minister , was permitted to live there . But he kept the gates open in the daytime , and the entire village strolled in and out . Meeting all classes when he took his daily exercise perhaps made him think proudly how democratic a statesman he had been all his life . He gave everyone a bon jour . He especially liked meeting Alex because she was an American and he vaguely remembered having advocated the payment of the war debts . " Oh , are n't politicians a bore ? " Cullen exclaimed with an odd proud laugh . " Worse than poets . " " Larry , please , " his wife said in haste , " please let 's not talk about that . " I wondered what that meant . Alex unlocked the little gate on the far side of the pond , and we strolled along an alMe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should appear in the distance , she would have to turn back . He had a way of inviting her to dine , and Mine . Bidou had asked her not to accept on account of the failing of his health , the folly of his old manhood . We all felt happier now that we were outdoors . It was beautiful in the park . The trees had been so lovingly tended ever since a pupil of LenOtre 's set them out , that each had developed its maximum character . The way they stood in informal groups , or in line , or alone at a little distance , seemed not only to conform to the art of parks but to express their feelings about each other : idiosyncrasies of affection or obedience , pride or pain . And unlike human characters in such an assembly , they promised or threatened nothing more ; no episodes or developments , Cullen walked up ahead with Alex . Now in the open air he not only laughed but shouted ; so that I could hear him telling her a yarn about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young married woman . And one day he and the husband had gone out alone together on the moor for a bit of rough shooting ; and he had shot the husband by accident , so to speak . Then he had married her . But he had worried about it all the rest of his life , which was not long ; and he had impoverished her in his will . It was ancient gossip : I had heard it before ; and at the time I did not see any oddity in Cullen 's telling it , except that it seemed funny to him and not to rne . When love is diabolic , I thought , a triangle is the simplest form it can take ; and a convenient form , if it can not be endured . The lovers to be pitied perhaps are those who have no one to hate ? what they long to kill , and what the killing would be for , incorporated in one and the same person , the one they love  --  whose rough shooting therefore can take place only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a crossroads ; and there we did see the short silhouette of old Bidou headed in our direction : his peculiar march or trudge , and the shrugging of his shoulders inside a great cape . All his life he had gone booted like a common soldier and blackly wrapped up , which had been a boon to caricaturists and a kind of electoral trade mark ; which now made it easy to avoid him . Mrs. Cullen asked if they might go on ahead and have a look at the famous old fellow . Alex and I turned back alone toward her house , by a short cut through a dense plantation of young trees , with vernal branches of old trees rounded overhead . It was like walking inside a great recumbent telescope , pointed at the ch  --  teau half a kilometer away . In the nineteenth century , under the personal supervision of Viollet-le-Duc and his friend the author of Carmen , Chancellet had been entirely , fussily restored . In the round bit of sunshine afar off , the lens of our telescope , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower beds and the moat , where a few ducks were splashing and lovemaking . I was in as foolish a good humor as Cullen ; everything seemed mysterious and sentimental . The rounded frame of branches in which we strolled , looking ahead into pinkish sunlight ; the tidy little architecture enframed , with its associations literary as well as historical ; the dying absent-minded erotic statesman exercising daily in an immutable circle around it ; our odd guests walking to meet him , woman with hawk and greedy man , whose eyes turned golden when he looked at her , whose spit ran at the mere mention of his dinner  --  all were gathered around me , I vainly fancied , to make one great vague thing very simple and clear to me . What more could I ask ? But it is always foolish to expect simplicity . All one can do is to substitute little facts for great speculations , little performances for immense desire , and call this : simplification . The return by ourselves gave me a chance to question Alex about the Cullens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the pig-sticking . Madeleine rode ideally , but the rule of the club forebade women to carry a spear . Cullen had shown a definite lack of enthusiasm and indeed a lack of talent ; however , he had gone out every day and not done badly . When one of the vile brave beasts appeared in the distance  --  flickering along the shrub , suddenly fleeing out across open ground like the shadow of a flying bird  --  the Irish woman would gallop out with the very first riders ; her husband following hard , looking as if he might fall any minute but not falling . At the last minute , when the spears began to point down along the shoulders of the horses , she would rein up short or turn aside . Suddenly she would not be there any longer , and Cullen still would be . Her ambition for him and his poor horsemanship  --  so it appeared to the others  --  betrayed him into prowess . Alex heard a club member say that once or twice at the kill his audacity and ferocity had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One morning his horse stepped into a hole and threw him right down beside the boar , a big wicked one already wounded ; and he behaved with great sense and courage , and kept his horse away from its tushes , although he was not quite sober . His not being quite sober was the trouble in general . One afternoon Mrs. Cullen had said as much to Alex . " Poor Larry , when we 're in Ireland or in London with nothing to do , is inclined to overeat , and furthermore to drink far too much . " Alex must have been impressed by this confession for she quoted some of it word for word . " Most things are a beastly bore for him , you know ; that 's his real weakness . But you ca n't say anything to a grown man about drinking , after all , can you ? It 's such a horrid little unimportant thing . They 're proud , and they resent having to think of it . I had an aunt who talked about it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could therefore , she told Alex , she tried to keep him distracted ; busy doing things , in good company which inspired him to do well ; abroad , and outdoors as much as possible . He often complained that it was no way to live ; but it had kept him fit and good-natured . She was younger than he , Alex pointed out ; and she had money of her own ; and she was a clever , unconventional , and rather self-indulgent woman . Yet she devoted herself entirely to him , every instant , year in and year out . He on the other hand was not perfectly faithful , in spite of his devotion to her . When they were in Tangier a pretty young American named Baroness Levene came across from Malaga , and flirted with Cullen ; and he obviously responded to it . One of the Tangier residents asked them all to dine , and while the men stayed in the dining room , Madeleine had been very rude to the little interloper . A day or two later she spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she assured Alex , to mind her husband 's virile frivolity . She never doubted for an instant that he loved her , and no other woman . His response to the others was all make-believe or in fun . She alluded again to his deadly tedium ; his need of some novelty to pass the time somehow , every day of his life , every hour ; and his other weaknesses in direct conse quence . A little philandering , like eating and drinking , gave him something to think about . Whereas marriage was infinitely simple for her , she said ; she never needed the attention of other men . She supposed this to be so settled and so apparent in her character that it bored men and they let her alone . Alex had observed a number of acceptable men not letting her alone in the least ; rather smitten . Yet there seemed to be no affectation or insincerity in Mrs. Cullen 's account of herself . Women who have been spoiled by the many , tormented by one , often have an air of innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following winter in London ; and there they were engaged in a very odd sport indeed : underground activity of Irish rebellion . Cullen was perfectly and anciently Irish , and one of his brothers had been a friend of Casement 's . Whereas Madeleine was not a Catholic ; and she had Ulster blood and English blood ; and as a child she had lived in Canada . Yet she was the rebel , or she ardently played the part of one ; Larry followed . Alex heard him speak very angrily of the British , disgustedly of de Valera . But he laved joining in others ' opinion , no matter what , and embellishing his repetition of it , as best he could  --  how could one tell what he thought ? Perhaps it was hard for him to tell himself . All that winter they were at home informally almost every evening to the oddest patriots . At first glance it looked like a literary salon . The ringleader was the poet McVoy : a young man of great conversation , with a half-rapacious , half-religious face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bombing , another with a bit of his cheek shot away , and certain bereaved and cruel women , and a bizarre priest . Their political opinion was all tinged with piety , even puritanism . They would have been ashamed to eat or drink or be merry in any way , with so much to be done for Eire . Cullen yielded to the general austerity . Furthermore , he told Alex , they could not afford to live well that winter , because of their contributions to the cause . Alex had never seen him in better form , lean and youthful and , if not exactly cheerful , amiable . Rebellion evidently served as an excellent exercise and diet . There was also amorous anxiety : he thought McVoy in love with Madeleine . Alex indeed thought so too . But all Madeleine appeared to want of the poet was for him to keep on his political high horse , in his fascinating conspiratorial vein , for Larry 's amusement . Rioting and sabotage and perhaps even assassination  --  as it were sticking of the Ulster pig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the thick of it , because it would be good for him . . . Suddenly all that ceased , Alex never heard why . They sublet their house and spent the summer in Vienna and Budapest . That was the summer Mrs. Cullen bought her first hawk , the tiered that died of the croaks . This little information Alex gave me as we sauntered slowly through the ex-minister 's park . Now we were back near our gate , under the great beeches . Alex had been a little anxious lest the Cullens get lost . But there in the broken light , pallid shade , they came at a brisk pace , engaged in a vivacious discussion of some sort , which they ceased as soon as they saw us . " He 's a dear , your old politician , " Madeleine said . " He spoke to us , and then what do you suppose he did ? He did bird imitations for Lucy ; I mean to say , he whistled at her . " Evidently Cullen preferred French politicians to Irish . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lark and some bird I did n't know . He told us what it was , but it was French . Quite good . " " And Larry , was n't he cheerful and civil ? Perhaps he thought that if he kept whistling long enough , Lucy would answer . Was n't it funny ? " 1 thought it touching as well as funny : that old man had been whistling to his compatriots like that for half a century , and as a rule a majority had answered ; but , alas , nothing much had come of it , for France . Now Mrs. Cullen was ready to feed Lucy . But her chauffeur and Jean , who had gone to the neighbor 's dovecot , had not returned . Foolish Eva felt sure they were in a ditch somewhere , or quarreling , or lost . So we sat down again ; and I like a fool inquired what they thought of French and English and German politics . Cullen was out of breath but he sniffed wonderfully and cleared his throat , preliminary to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " his wife requested , smiling at me to make it less impolite . She was fondling Lucy , gazing at her eye to eye , slowly shaking her head at her ; and the wicked beak moved in exact obedience to the tip of her nose as if it were magnetized . " Lucy 's hungry , " she said solemnly . " Feel her breast . " She took my hand and held it against the tasseled plumage ; and indeed there was a humming and stiffening in it , like a little voltage of electricity . Her eyes were moist and explosive ; and the instant her mistress 's eyes released them , down they went to the gauntlet , as if expecting a feathery form in agony to materialize out of the leather . " Feel her feet , " Mrs. Cullen added ; and I did , while she explained that birds always have a higher temperature than animals . Yet they were slick and dry like a serpent . I could feel what they wanted to do , what they wanted to have , swelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throbs . My pleasure in touching them was half embarrassment ; and it set my mind running back to the thought I had left off an hour ago : this hawk 's hunger was like amorous appetite . I say thought  --  and it is thought now , as I recall it and try to tell it  --  but at the time it was only a vague flashing day-dream . It all came together like one composite phrase : old bachelor hungry bird , aging-hungryman-bird , and how I hate desire , how I need pleasure , how I adore love , how difficult middle age must be . . . . Then , I lamented to myself , if your judgment is poor you fall in love with those who could not possibly love you . If romance of the past has done you any harm , you will not be able to hold on to love when you do attain it ; your grasp of it will be out of alignment . Or pity or self-pity may have blunted your hand so that it makes no mark . Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrated . Life is almost all perch . There is no nest ; no one is with you , on exactly the same rock or out on the same limb . The circumstances of passion are all too petty to be companionable . So there you sit , and you try to sit still , and doze and dream to save trouble . It is the kind of thing you have to keep quiet about for others ' sake , politeness 's sake : itching palm and ugly tongue and unsighted eye and empty flatulent physiology as a whole ; and your cry of desire , ache , ache , ringing in your own ears . No one else hears it ; and you get so tired of it yourself that you ca n't wait to grow old . .. . Thus in an instant I foolishly imagined myself growing old ; and meanwhile Mrs. Cullen had not ceased speaking with that single-minded vivacity of hers , but a little somber . " Since we caught Lucy , " she said , " she 's never had a mouthful to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn the same glove . Think what it must mean to her t " It was an impressive unpleasant object , that glove , stiffened and discolored by a hundred little sanguinary banquets . It resembled things you see in cases in anthropological museums ; fetishes of awful religion , sacrificial utensils , witch-doctors ' kits . And the feet with crescent toenails trod it so passionately that you wondered how the wrist inside endured it . " You know , she 's not really attached to me personally , " Mrs. Cullen said . " If I gave you the glove she 'd be yours instead of mine . It 's as simple as that , I think . It 's what 's called behaviorism , is n't it ? Would you like to try it ? Try taking her a moment . " She turned round and held Lucy some five or six inches below the chair-back , and after a moment 's hesitation Lucy hopped up there . Mrs. Cullen 's hand was large and mine is not ; so that I was able to squeeze into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another large diamond on that hand , which under the pressure of the leather had bruised her finger a little . . . . Then I held my wrist five or six inches above the chair-back ; and Lucy , with her belief in food-stained leather added to her belief in the highest possible perch , hopped again . " That 's what they call an inferiority complex , do n't they ? " Cullen proudly demanded , not to be outdone by his wife 's use of that other catchword . " Madeleine ca n't understand one thing about psychology . " " Very well , Larry . I tell you she 's hungry , " his wife answered . And by the tone of her voice you would have thought her the hungry one herself . I drew a deep breath , in which I got the hawk odor , slightly bloody , slightly peppery . I had noticed it before , but without distinguishing it from Mrs. Cullen 's French scent . The body , well balanced on its hot feet , weighed less than I had supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pulled it a bit  --  as fashionable women 's fingernails do on certain fabrics  --  though evidently she held them as loose and harmless as she could . Only her grip as a whole was hard , like a pair of tight heated iron bracelets . Alex offered her congratulations upon Lucy 's evident peace of mind with me ; I would make a good falconer . That reminded me of my father and his magic with animals , which filled me with envy and antipathy when I was a boy . He could force a crazy colt to its knees , or castrate a young boar , or chloroform a desperate trapped owl ; and their wretched muscles relaxed and surrendered , their eyes blinked in perfect gentleness in alignment with his eyes . His eyes , or perhaps it was his hands , seemed able to promise them something . Half my life , I said to myself , has been discovering that my character is not the antithesis or the contradiction of his ; here was a new kinship . Perhaps I could cope with horse or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps even with . a wild antipathetic son , disinclined to live  --  who knows ? This was a gratifying thought but not altogether happy : vast vague potentiality of things I did not wish to do in any case . I happen to be a trifle long-sighted ; and now Lucy was so close that I could not quite see her in focus ; and I have always had a fear of going blind . One good flutter , one simple thrust , and she could have slit an eyelid or ruptured an eyeball in an instant . She did not shuffle much on the borrowed gauntlet . But the vague dilated dark of her eye , the naked ring around it , the inner eyelids opening and closing as instantly as bubbles , seemed worse than restlessness . I was ashamed to tell her mistress that I was afraid . No doubt the chances of her actually hurting were negligible . Mrs. Cullen 's half-supercilious glance at us was reassuring . Still I felt rather as if I had a great thought of death concentrated and embodied and perched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to think of this Lucy  --  bloodthirsty brute with a face like a gouge , with feet like two sets of dirty scalpels  --  as significant of love ? Perhaps those two things , imaginary death and hopeless desire , always lie close together in one 's mind , foolishly interchangeable . Mrs. Cullen meanwhile , with vacated wrist , seemed the most restless woman in the world . She kept crossing and uncrossing her perfect stilted feet ; leaning this way and that in the soft armchair ; clasping and unclasping her jeweled fingers . It suggested one more explanation of her attachment to Lucy ; falconry made her sit still . Perhaps too she was slightly jealous of my successful deputy-ship . " The real reason Lucy likes you so much , " she murmured , " is that it 's getting on toward mealtime . She fancies you may have a little steak or half a pigeon in your pocket . You look prom ising to her . What do you suppose has become of your cook ? I do hope he and Ricketts have n't gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tripped across to the great window . She tripped back and paused beside us and teased Lucy as Cullen had done , but in the opposite spirit . The star sapphire slid a little from one teasing finger to the next , which Lucy observed with interest . It looked like an unsocketed eye , I thought . " Oh , Alex , " Mrs. Cullen said , " you 're so intelligent . I 'm afraid you think me very sentimental . I 'm not really . I do not want a falcon to be attached to me personally . When animals get that sort of feeling it 's too awful . Knowing the sound of your voice , liking the way you smell , wanting to be touched , all that . I hate it . It 's such a parody of us , it 's worse than we are . A bird like Lucy is so simple and straight . You make a promise and she expects you to keep it , that 's all . She knows what she wants , and who gives it to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assured us that his wife did n't mean a word of this cynical stuff . But he did agree about one thing : " Birds arc selfish as the devil . That 's why I ca n't care for them . I 'd rather have a dog , I tell you . " " Do you hear , Lucy ? He 'd rather have a dog . " She said this in the way of wicked affectation , perhaps toying with the idea of being hated by him for it . Then she turned briskly to me : " I 'll take her back now , Mr. Tower , if you please . I think she 'll bate in a minute . " Once more we exchanged the glove . Once more Lucy considered , on the rough leather , the stain of yesterdays ' meals and the hope of to-day 's and to-morrow 's , and leaped up with alacrity . Her mistress carefully fondled her to prevent her bating , but she bated nevertheless . After that , Mrs. Cullen heaved a greater sigh than before , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own light but significant remarks had hurt her at last , I fancied . And now she added that , simple though hawks all were , you could never really trust one . " Oh , I shall have to be so careful , never to fly Lucy at things she can not catch and kill . The least failure makes her hopeless . My man in Hungary says that if she misses her quarry twice I must call it a day and keep her hooded ; otherwise it 's risky . Because if she should miss a third time she might leave me ; fly off and never return . They 're all alike : the haggard you 've hunted with for years ; even the eyas you have taken from the nest and babied all its life . . . " " Damned ungrateful , I say , " Cullen jeered . " No , Larry . Lucy gives up her freedom and stays with me because it 's a better life , more food and more fun . If it does n't work , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough . . . " Cullen giggled . I did n't . For it is the way religious faith goes , in the sense of God 's failure : and it is the way true love ends : missing the third time . That much of life I already knew ; I had missed twice . I glanced at Alex , wondering if the mysterious turn this small talk was taking troubled her too . But her face had its pretty well-bred passivity ; I could not tell . The light in the Irish woman 's eyes was fantastic , focused like glass on her great weak husband , then on me for just a moment with something like embarrassing affection . She and I understood each other . She seemed to me a very passionate woman , but it was a kind of plural passion , all confused or crossed : work and play and sense of beauty , the maternal and the conjugal and the misanthropic , mixed . Perhaps that is a peculiarity of childless women . Female character has a great many secondary traits and minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them or stamp them out . It is anarchy if they all flourish . " Tower , " she said , " you would make a good falconer . Why do n't you take it up , in the States ? And you too , Alex . Everyone should have some hobby , some pet , I think . And all the other pets really are too awful . Ugh , how I despise dogs ! " she exclaimed in a dull , disgusted tone of voice . " Do you know what dogs remind me of ? It 's not a nice thing to say but I do mean it . Prostitutes ; all things to all men , and all that . And all shapes and sizes , from adapting themselves to everything and everybody for centuries , with no integrity . Men love them for that ; it 's flattering . " Falcons have never changed . Forty centuries of falconry , think of it ! And still wild ; every feather as it was , and the same everywhere . I tell you , there 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs , if they only were n't so damned amorous . Kittens to be drowned every few months ; is n't it awful ! " My well-bred Alex in spite of herself made a little shocked face . It startled me too , because just then like a fool I had been thinking of Mrs. Cullen as a childless woman . What about those wild Irish sons of hers , shifting for themselves at Cullen Hall , riding and spoiling her favorite hunters , hunting with Lord Bild ? I said a kind of prayer for them . That is , I hoped that they really were wild . Cullen had spoken of them as practically mature men ; but perhaps he himself was not mature enough to judge of it . I hoped that they did not love their mother much . If they were at all backward or sensitive it was good of her , wise of her , to keep out of Ireland . At this point wild Lucy flung up her wings and let her mute drop to the floor . Mrs. Cullen cheerfully apologized , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant that Lucy was in excellent health . A healthy falcon 's mute is the cleanest wastage in nature , and by no stretch of imagination could Alex or I have been offended by it . Cullen offendedly stirred his great body about in the great soft armchair ; his face got redder ; his light eyes protruded . But they protruded at us rather than it . Perhaps he feared , or perhaps hoped , that we would somehow express disapprobation or disgust . Alex rang for Eva , and of course that simple creature did not mind ; it rather amused her . She fetched a towel and some wax , and knelt beautifully , and gave the parquet a very good restoration . During this , Jean came rushing in , sweaty and pleased with himself . When he saw his dear beauty there on her knees he made a gleeful sound and gave her a tap as he passed , which made her blush . He and Ricketts in the Daimler had had a blowout on the back road . But dinner would not be much delayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seated himself by the roadside and dressed the pigeons with his jackknife . Mrs. Cullen asked him how large Lucy 's pigeon was ; and he sent Eva after it : a rumpled thing in a basket with warm damned eyes . She instructed them to wring its neck and chap it in half and bring it back , with its feathers and half the giblets . Meanwhile she asked me to move the straight chair into a dusky corner under the staircase . Though the least shy hawk in the world , Lucy would not feed properly outdoors or with a light in her eyes . Next Mrs. Cullen requested a number of towels to protect her dress , and Eva brought a worn-out tablecloth ; and Alex helped tie this under her chin like a bib and spread it out over her lap . She sat with her pretty legs far apart , no longer a fashionable woman but rather like a priestess ; or as if this were to be some surgical operation or painful travail . Whereupon Jean returned with the portion of pigeon . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall on the waxed floor ; and again Eva mopped up . Mrs. Cullen took the half-bird in the hand on which Lucy perched , pinching it between gloved forefinger and thumb , at Lucy 's feet ; turning it temptingly . At first Lucy stared at Alex and me so insolently that we drew a few steps away from the staircase . Jean and Eva also wanted to watch , but Alex reminded them that we too were hungry . I had been hearing so much and thinking so romantically of hawk-hunger , that I expected a lunge and a grab , like a wolf or a cat ; it was not so at all . It took two or three minutes for Lucy 's appetite to develop , to accumulate . In a state of nature , no doubt it depends upon the fun of pursuit , voluptuous air in her wings , and the hovering and teasing ; and there would not be any real spasm of Lucy 's love of food until the instant she felt food in her beak . Now there had to be time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her narrow mind ; time at least to regret it . The tedium of this conjugal kind of repast had to be overcome somehow ; so she doubted and deliberated and imagined . " Damn your pride , Lucy , " Mrs. Cullen muttered ; then murmured to us in her schoolgirl French , because Lucy did not understand French , " l'appe'tit vient en rnangeant . " Upon which I reminded myself that on the whole , throughout life as a whole , the appetites which do not arise until we have resolved to eat , which we can not comprehend until we have eaten , arc the noblest  --  marital , aesthetic , religious . . . At last Lucy 's curly breast did throb ; a few feathers bristled up ; her wings stood out a few inches ; her greenish fists clenched on the glove ; then her whole body began to point down beak first like a water-diviner 's stick . She set her feet a little farther apart on her mistress 's wrist . Then she stooped straight between them and thrust into the piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braced her legs and pulled and straightened back up with a morsel , which after a moment she shifted away into her throat and with a sinuous motion or a toss , swallowed . Until the end , until there was no more pigeon , Mrs. Cullen had to encourage her to keep her mind on what she was doing . " The important thing , " she said , " is to get her to take feathers enough . Her digestion depends a good deal on that . " When she paused and raised her weird face between mouthfuls , it seemed spiritual rather than sensual ; a bigoted face . There was no histrionic angry temper , no showing off . Thoroughly and slowly it went on to the end , with meditation upon every feather , every crumb of meat , every sip of blood  --  sacramental . Once or twice , because she did not like the way some wisp of plumage or tiny tendon felt ? or because she liked it extremely  --  she shook her head hard ; and a spot of blood appeared on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . Perhaps you could not have watched it if you were squeamish ; neither Alex nor I was . But after the fourth or fifth beakful Lucy had a bad moment , modesty or imaginary repletion , and Mrs. Cullen asked us to move still farther away ; and we were glad to go . We at down beside Cullen in front of the big window . It interested me to observe , or to guess at , his feeling about this . When his wife first called for Lucy 's banquet he had pulled a long face . I think that may have been only fond anxiety , lest in her serving of it she appeared to Alex and me coarse or comical . He kept his eyes averted , but it was not disgust , surely , for it put him in mind of his own eating . He talked to us of that with enthusiasm and in great detail . In Paris the past week someone had sent them away out on the Avenue Jean Jaure 's for a steak : year after year they always telephoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which took two days ; and so forth . Which brought him finally to the present , the great casserole of pigeons which Jean was preparing . At that point , I think , Alex regarded him almost with detestation . The half-pigeon out of the way , Mrs. Cullen decided to put Lucy outdoors to weather , as it is called . We followed her into the garden where she selected the back of a rustic bench as a suitable perch . But there had been signs of more than usual nervousness during the feeding : it seemed best to leave her hooded . Because of the unaccustomed warmth of the afternoon , after Scotland , Mrs. Cullen said , she had a slight headache ; and she retired with Alex to the bedroom fur some aspirin and a moment 's repose . ( To be concluded )
