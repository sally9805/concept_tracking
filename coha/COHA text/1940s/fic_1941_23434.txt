FULL CIRCLE A STORY BY JAMES STERN r ' o small trees in green tubs , rustic entinels of Hamblcdon House , stood on each side of the library window . From within the room their tops showed only two inches above the window ledge . Above them a pale shaft of evening sun , like a solid golden bar , came in through the glass panes and shed its light upon the military prints on the opposite wall . All four walls of the library were encrusted with prints , paintings , drawings , etchings  --  all displaying different phases of military life in the British Army . On the mantel stood an array of faded photographs of dead men as once they had sat alive before a camera , dressed in the multi-colored uniforms of their various regiments . On small uneasy-looking Chippendale tables lay a medley of military knickknacks  --  trophies , souvenirs of almost forgotten wars , medals hung in a glass frame , and pads of dead foxes killed after having fled from somewhere to somewhere in their last breathless minutes on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with volumes of Red Books . On the ledge in front of it , beneath some drooping begonias , lay a colored tin box containing a dry chunk of chocolate once presented by Queen Victoria to each one of those who had fought in , and survived , the South African campaign . Adrian Winter was sitting on the green carpet , gazing at the crown of his father 's head which he could see over the back of the paternal armchair . This was all he could see of the Captain , the oldest ( retired ) captain in the British Army . It was a black crown , cropped short , so that the hairs stuck up fan wise , like the spikes of a sea-urchin . The Captain was far away in the Times . The 17th Lancers were in Something-abad , most of the officers of the 15th Hussars in the bar of Shepherd 's Hotel , Cairo , and the 1st Life Guards were still floating up and down the Thames in blue blazers . The Captain was marching through all of these places at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzing round his head were roaring into his ears : Glor-y , Glor-y , Ally-loo-yah Rud-yard Kip-ting 's boots . . . boots . . Adrian could hear one of his father 's feet tap-tapping on the green carpet . All the men are out of step every damned one of ' em this infernal sun 's given me a headache those bloody Boers are too blasted near for my liking wonder what to-night 's billets will be like thank God I 'm a Captain on a horse  --  Hey there , Private Moore , keep to the ranks ca n't you ! Adrian looked up at his mother ; she was sitting on the sofa turning over the pages of The Good Gardener . Then he looked at the clock on the mantel . In a quarter of an hour he knew Mrs. Winter would speak . " Adrian I think it 's your bedtime is n't it mind you put your soldiers in their proper boxes so they wo n't get broken I 'll be up soon are n't you going to say good-night to Daddy . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gazed down at the long cardboard boxes on the carpet at his knees . Although he had been sitting there for over half an hour he had unpacked only one of the six boxes of toy soldiers . He had played a little with the miniature machine gun until he caught and hurt his finger in its trigger . After that he had upset all twelve Guardsmen on to the floor , then stood them up in a row and looked down on them till he lifted his eyes and began to stare at the crown of his father 's head . Mrs. Winter spoke : " Going to hunt to-morrow , Arthur ? " Silence . " Arthur , going to hunt to-morrow ? " " Hunk ? " " Hunting to-morrow ? " " Oh-er ! Huntin ' ? What ? To-morrow ? Oh-er , yes . . . of course , Doll . Of course I 'm huntin ' ? whatcher mean ? " " Nothing . I was only wondering . Might be a good day . " Silence . " Think it 'll be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Might be a good day , I said . " " Good day ? Oh , to-morrow . Oh , yes , yes , might  --  h 'm might . . . miBy Jove , see this ? " " What 's that ? " " Old Hunlake 's dead ! " " Oh , Arthur , poor man ! How awful 1 I am sorry . . . er . . . who was he ? " " Old Hunlake ? My dear Doll , he used to command the regiment ! " " Oh , I am . . . Was he old ? " Silence . " Was he getting on , Arthur ? " " Hunk ? " " Not very young , I suppose ? " " Very young ? Very yo . . . oh , old Hunlake ? Oh , should n't think so . Let 's see . . . h 'm . . . he was a Major in eighty-fi . . . . Oh , it 'll put it in the Times , of course . . . . Hearne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charles James , of Oak Priory , Beltham , in his sixty-first year . Yers , sixty-one . Great man to hounds . " " I am sorry . So sad for his wife and children ! " " Not a bit , my dear . Bachelor  --  one of the best-known members of the Bachelor 's . ' Never liked the ladies . Wonderful man on a horse  --  wonderful . I remember my father telling me that in seventy ? " " Oh , of course , I remember , he was the man who broke his nose out hunt " Suddenly , but noiselessly , the library door opened . Cyril Potts , fifteen years butler at Hambledon House , stole in with such inhuman silence that it would have been extremely uncomfortable for a stranger to have looked up and beheld this gaunt black figure , carrying in one hand a silver salver . " Any more for the post , sir ? " Silence . Cyril Potts moved toward the back of the Captain 's chair like a gigantic cat stalking a bird . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretended to cough into the palm of his free hand . " Any more letters for the post , sir ? " Silence . " Arthur , Potts wants the letters ! " " Hunk ? " " Potts , Arthur . " " Who ? " " Arthur  --  Potts , behind you ! " The Captain swung round in his chair as an elephant might flounder in deep water . The Times crackled to the floor . " Any more letters for ? " " Oh , is that Potts ? Letters ? " The Captain 's right hand dived into a coat pocket and appeared again , holding an envelope . " Dinner at eight sharp , Potts . " ( Dinner in Hambledon House had been at eight sharp since the beginning of the nineteenth century . ) " Very good , sir . " A blind man could not have told that Cyril Potts had left the room . " Potts is getting very old-looking , do n't you think , Arthur ? " " Hunk ? " " Potts looking old , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's not been here twenty years ! It seems only yesterday he was fourth footman . We used to call him James " " Still he works very ? " Mrs. Winter bit her tongue , flushed crimson in the face . ( " What in the name of goodness made me say that ! " ) " He what  --  he what what , what-say , hunk ? " " Oh , I was just thinking he works just as much as he did when he was a young man , Arthur . " " As much as he did ! I should damn well think so too ! Why the blazes not ? The more work these servants do the less time they have to slack about and grumble . I do n't s'pose you 'll believe me when I tell you that only six months ago I saw Potts talking to a strange woman outside the Hambledon Arms ! Whatcher think o ' that , eh ? Would n't mind betting he 'd been inside having a drink ! Slovenly and loose behavior/ wo n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silence in the library was even more profound than the English evening outside . Adrian was still staring at the Guardsmen , the twelve of them standing mute and motionless in a line , their faces almost invisible beneath their enormous black busbies . " Wish I could snap off one of their big heads without anyone hearing ! If only they would bleed ! Oh , I do hate you , you silly useless things ! " He held one of the twelve soldiers in his hands . He pressed its head far in to one of his palms , then closed his fingers over it . With his other hand he gripped the feet of the soldier , and with a grimace of hate bent them far away from the head . Snap ! The little black busby and face fell away from the body into Adrian 's palm . " What was that ? " Mrs. Winter gazed about her like a wren on the alert . Out of one eye Adrian peered up at her . In each hand he was clenching a broken piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Was that you , Adrian  --  that noise ? " " Me , Mummy ? What noise ? " " A little noise I heard . Seemed to come from ? " " What  --  what , what-say , what 's all this ? " The Captain plunged round in his chair , faced his son . " Did you hear a noise , Arthur ? " " Hunk ? " " A noise , Arthur . " Mrs. Winter was staring down at her son 's clenched fists . " Noise ? What noise ? " " Adrian ! " cried Mrs. Winter , " open your hands  --  at once ! " Adrian , perspiring , hesitated . Then quickly throwing behind him the pieces of Guardsman , he thrust out his small empty palms . To his horror he heard a crack as the busby hit the wainscoting behind him . " Adrian ! What was that you threw away ? " Mrs. Winter was already on her feet striding toward him , past him . Now she was bending down . Adrian shut his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like you to look at this . " Mrs. Winter held out the head of the Guardsman under her husband 's face . " What 's this , Doll ? What is it ? Beetle ? That infernal Potts , I told him only ? " " No , " replied Mrs. Winter , as though she were about to leave a pulpit . " No , Arthur , this is not a beetle , this is even more serious ; this is the mutilated head of one of Adrian 's beautiful soldiers which you gave him for Christmas . " Adrian held his breath . ( " Can I get out of the door in time , can I ? " ) " What-say , what ? " The Captain was on his feet , his little eyes glaring down at his son , the hairs of his mustache bristling like those on the back of a furious dog . " Did you  --  do this , did you  --  break this , did you ? ? " But the Captain 's tongue would not work fast enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended in a kind of breathless snarl . He was standing over the boy , the Guardsman 's head shaking to the trembling of the palm it was lying on . " Did you  --  or did you not  --  break this ? " Miles away Adrian heard the door close , and his mother 's feet walking away over the stone floor of the hall . " It broke  --  just broke  --  could n't help it ! " " Now that 's a damn lie and you know it ! A liar ! Know what that means ? " The Captain was shouting . " Know what that means , eh ? Ever heard o ' Hell , eh ? Know what they 'll do to you if you tell lies in the Army , eh ? " The Captain 's rage fell in the form of spittle on Adrian 's hair . " They 'll march you up and down the Square in full kit till you damn well tell the truth . That 's what they 'll do to you , my boy ! You be damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I know they wo n't  --  and I do n't blame ' em  --  if you do n't alter your conduct , and pretty quick too ! " The Captain bent down , gripped Adrian by the shoulder , and when he spoke again his voice was like that of a judge asking one last question before pronouncing the death sentence . " Did you  --  or did you not  --  breakthis  --  soldier ? " " It broke . " Captain Winter , very hot , very red in the face , strode away into the next . room . A week ago he had put a thin cane behind a cupboard in the corner , but yesterday Adrian had smashed it and buried the remains in the garden . Before his father had realized its disappearance Adrian was in his mother 's room . " God bless Mummy Daddy make Adrian good boy Amen . . . . " " Now nicely , Adrian . Elbows on my knees , hands together , properly . Remember Whom you 're speaking to and that He can see everything you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been very naughty , remember ! " " Our father chart in Heaven hallow 'd be Thy name Thy Kingdom come Thy will be **25;687;TOOLONG ? " " Adrian ! Nov that 's downright wicked ! I 'm going straight down to tell Daddy ! " " Oh , no ! Mummy , Mummy , I ? " " Too late now , young man , too late ! " And Mrs. Winter , flushed and furious , was already outside on the stairs , where she came face to face with the Captain , carrying a leather belt . " I .. . could n't find that blasted stick . . . bet it 's that swine Potts again . . . . What  --  what , what-say , hunk ? " " Arthur , I was just coming to fetch you . Adrian 's been ? " Then for the first time Mrs. Winter caught sight of the belt . " Oh , well , " she said , eying it significantly , " he 's in my room . " " In your room . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " Then you wo n't be down by eight sharp ! " breathed Adrian as he turned the key in the lavatory door . II Two flies buzzing round his head were roaring into his ears : Eets a lawng way to Tipper-rare-ree Eets a lawng way t000000 go . . . . " Going to hunt to-morrow , Arthur ? " Silence . " Arthur , going to hunt to-morrow ? " " Hunk ? " In a dozen years the small trees in green tubs in front of Hambledon House had grown two feet higher . In that time the Captain , now the oldest ( retired ) Colonel in the British Army , had rejoined its ranks to fight with France against Germany , and for four years he had fought like mad  --  with his fellow-officers on the Staff . From within the library the tops of the small trees showed twenty-six inches above the window ledge . Above them a pale shaft of evening sun came in through the glass panes and shed its light upon identically the same objects on the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only difference was that there were three more medals in the glass frame , and Adrian , instead of sitting on the floor , was balancing himself on the fender-seat , swinging one stained gray-flanneled leg and smoking a cigarette . He was a tall young man with a lock of hair that could not make up its mind whether to fall over one eye or to remain in a semi-loop on the side of his forehead . He wore a striped shirt open at the neck , and he sat staring at the floor as though he disliked all floors , particularly this one , intensely . Mrs. Winter , with a few gray hairs in her head , a few more lines under her eyes , and a copy of If Winter Comes lying upside down in her lap , was sitting on the sofa , gazing at her son . The Colonel , now bald , was invisible behind the Times . Suddenly a spaniel at his feet raised its head , tilted it on one side , shut its eyes , and began furiously to scratch an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bawled the Colonel , thumping the ground with his foot . The dog leaped up and , slinking off , came to rest beside Adrian . " Poor brute ! " said the young man , and patted the dog 's head . " Hunk ? " The Colonel 's head appeared and he glared at his son . But Adrian answered only by flicking some ash on to the floor . " Oh , Adrian , " murmured Mrs. Winter , the ash ? " " Sorry , Mother , " Adrian said , and as he bent down to dust it away the lock of hair made up its mind and fell over his face , hanging there like a small curled snake . " Hey ! " cried the Colonel , as though he were driving sheep along a road . " ' Bout time you got yer hair cut , my boy  --  infernal sloppiness ! " " It 's not quite long enough yet , " said Adrian nonchalantly , brushing back the fallen lock with his hand . " Long enough ! " The Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " Dammit , man  --  it 's down yer neck and over yer eyes , like a village yahoo ! My God , you wait till they see you at Sandhurst ! " " They wo n't , " murmured Adrian . MAGAZINE " They  --  what 's that , what-say , hunk ? " " Oh , " said Adrian , with the same exasperating indifference , " I just meant that they wo n't see me at Sandhurst . " " They wo n't see ? ? " The Colonel choked . " Good God , man , it 's too late now to start thinking of any other way of getting into the Army ! " " That 's a good thing ! " said Adrian . " What the  --  what the devil are you at now  --  a good thing , eh ? The exam 's in October , you know . " The Colonel rose and , standing in front of his son , glared down at him . " Ain'tcher preparing for it ? " he blurted out . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea were shocking . " You mean  --  you mean  --  you do n't wanter go in th ' Army ? " The Colonel 's face was aghast . " Mc ? " said Adrian , looking up in splendid mock-surprise . " Me ? Hcavens , no  --  why ? " Mrs. Winter suddenly emitted a short gasp , closed her eyes , and sank back into the sofa . The Colonel , his hands clenched , his mustache more than ever like a piece of dead furze , was dumb . He began to walk up and down the room ; on each turn-about he made an effort to speak , but none of his efforts was coherent . Suddenly he halted before his son . " Aferlf . why ... dammit , man , " he struggled like an eel on a hook . " I - er - I - I - I - thc Army , why  --  I never **32;714;TOOLONG ! " " Funny , " murmured Adrian , " and it never entered my head . " " What 's that , what-say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been influenced toward the military life , serve your country  --  a decent , honest , clean , . healthy exis . . . I-I-I -- damned if It understand fools like you ! Good Lord , I was in the Army , all my friends were in the Army . If you 're not going into it I should like to know what in the blue blazes you are going ter do ? " The Colonel finished like an express train leaving a station . " Ah ! " said Adrian , rolling his eyes . Then , with a mischievous smile , he raised his right hand and tapped the side of his nose . " Ah , " he said , " that 's the question  --  what 's to do ! " " Hey ! " shouted the Colonel , " I 'm damned if I 'm going to have this infernal offhand manner . I 've given you a good education , the best money can buy ; clothes , food , everything of the best , and now I-I-I  --  now , just look at you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to look facetiously at himself . He was about to say , " Well , not so bad on the whole , " when his father burst out again : " What  --  what thanks do we get , eh ? Whatcher goin ' ter do with yerself , eh ? If you think you 're goin ' ter slack about in those filthy clothes and long hair , disgracing us , your father and mother , and do nothing  --  well , let me tell you , rn'lad , you  --  are ? " " Not ! " shouted Adrian . Colonel Winter 's effort to control himself was magnificent , and successful , as it well deserved to be . He drew in a deep breath and looked at his son as a ravenous man might look at a meal . Then Adrian did a strange thing  --  he touched his father . He had not touched , nor been touched by , his father for ten years . Still sitting on the fender , he raised his arm and unbuttoned the bottom button of the Colonel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he were addressing a child , " you see , if you wore a simple shirt like me , without butt ? " " Like you ! " shouted the Colonel in horror , and he jumped away as though he had been stung , and did up his button . Mrs. Winter beat a hasty and silent retreat . " Shish , " said Adrian softly , " it 's most awfully vulgar to shout . Besides , you know , I 'm not really so bad . Taking things all round , I might be much more extreme , more convinced , better  --  ah , worse , I mean . Now , a Communist friend of mine has just been thrown into pris ? " " Whaaaaaaat l " yelled the Colonel , and he bounced back and faced his son again . " Quietly , " said Adrian , raising a hand . " No , really , it might have been me , but , as I say , it was n't . So that 's some conso ? " " A Comm-Communi ? ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , that , " said Adrian . " Yes , he has what they call ' very definite and extreme Socialist tendencies ' ? which means that he is what they 'd probably call in the Army  --  red-'ot ! A charming person , but he 's always fighting and shouting , an awful nuisance even to his friends . At Eton he used to insist on me helping him to address meetings in Windsor . Really horribly dangerous  --  worse than a war . His father 's a general , wonder if you know him ? " " I-I-er-I ? " At last the Colonel burst like a suddenly-broken water-pipe . " I simply ca n't stand all this , what the hell 's it got to do with . . . I . . . what I want to know is if you 're not going into the Army what the blue blazes do you think you 're goin ' ter ? ? " " Ah , " said Adrian , shaking his head , " as I said before , that 's the question . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who need not go on the dole , who 've been born in a post-war age like this when everything 's so upside down that one wonders sometimes if it 's worth living at all , we who 've never known want all our youth , but instead been ' educated ' and ' educated ' for fourteen years instead of four  --  well , it 's a bit hard on us , you know . I mean , there 's good reason fur there being no stimulus ? " " I-I-er , " the Colonel burst again . " I do n't want to hear all this rot , I want to know what the hell you think you 're going to do . . ! " " Well , " said Adrian in a tired voice , " I 've been thinking it over and I 've come to the conclusion I 'd rather like to try my hand at  --  at writing . I ? " " Good God ! Whatcher mean  --  writ-ing ? " " Oh , you know , surely , " said Adrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the bookshelf , " words and sentences , and ? " he pointed at the bookcase , " those things  --  books1 " Something seemed to be leaving the Colonel . It was as though the air in a tight toy balloon had suddenly found a small outlet and the balloon were growing smaller and smaller . Adrian looked at his father and thought , for the first time in his life , what a little man he was . " But do n't you think that 's rather a good idea ? " he asked . " I 'm one of very simple tastes and , you see , the Army ? " " Well , what about the Army ? Certainly the finest and healthiest profess ? " " H 'm . As a matter of fact , from the health point of view , I 'm not sure that I do n't agree with you . But , you see , the awful thing is that I 'd simply hate it . That uniform , such a color too , and the marching , shaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to your head , shouting at people when you need n't , and being shouted at , and then  --  worst of all and which is , I suppose , the main object of the whole business  --  actually shooting at people who may well be very charming  --  the immorality of it ! It 's bad enough to have to kill people to make the world better , but when you know you 're going to make it worse  --  no , I do n't think I could ever be party to anything quite so wicked as that . I always remember your once telling me that if you told lies in the Army they marched you up and down the square till you damn well told the truth . Well , I ask you , ' is that nice , ' as someone ? ? " Suddenly the library door opened . Cyril Potts , twenty-seven years butler at Hambledon House , stole in . " Any more letters for the post , sir ? " Silence . " Any more letters for the post , sir ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his deflated father . " Hunk ? " III Twenty flies buzzing round Adrian 's head were roaring into his ears Mon-ey , mon-ey  --  make some  --  mon-ey ! Ad-rian Winter , work . work ! " Going to work to-night , Adrian ? " Silence . The two trees in front of Hambledon House had grown too large for their tubs , so they had been taken out and planted one each side of the library window , which was very dirty . From within the room their tops were invisible , not because of the dirt , but because the trees had grown too high . Between them a pale shaft of sun managed to ooze its way through the grime on the glass panes and shed its light on a reproduction of Van Gogh 's " Sunflowers " on the opposite wall . All four walls of the one-time library , now one of only four rooms in use at Hambledon House , were encrusted with dust-covered prints , paintings , drawings , etchings  --  all displaying different phases in the art of the French Impressionists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pamphlets , manuscripts , and backless books . On the floor , partly covered by moth-eaten rugs , in corners , peeping out from under uneasy-looking chairs and the sagging sofa , was strewn a medley of literary reviews , monthlies , weeklies , articles  --  souvenirs of almost-forgotten work ; pipes lay there in their own old ash , as well as cigarette-ends viciously trodden to death between one written sentence and another . There was but one photograph in the room  --  in the center of the mantel , under a large portrait of Lenin  --  a colored photograph of a man it was , resplendent in scarlet-and-blue uniform , holding in one hand a helmet whose long white plume rose like a fountain-jet to within an inch of the gentleman 's chin . The likeness was of the late Colonel Winter , who for some years , in company with his wife , had been lying in the village cemetery . Peter Winter was lying on his back on the floor , trying to discover the crown of his father 's head , which was all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armchair . But Peter could n't find the crown , for his father 's hair was so long , had gone so long unbrushed , that what crown there might be lay invisible beneath cascades of brown hair that fell over the collar of his scarlet shirt . Adrian was far away in the book advertisements of the Sunday Times . " None of these devils knows how to write and yet every damn one of ' em is a flaming genius . Each Sunday finds ' em like flies on a window  --  Good God , here am I with eight books written , and while Mr. Winter 's grim and forceful style is still making us see all he so trenchantly describes , ' that same Mr. Winter gets grimmer , less forceful , and poorer every day . . . . " Peter glanced from the back of his father 's head to the photograph on the mantel . Slowly his eyes opened wider with interest and admiration . " Say , Vera , did old Grandpop go to Eton ? " Vera Winter , Peter 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing of her husband 's head . She was slim and locked five years younger than her age ; her black hair , smelling slightly of brilliantine , was an inch or two shorter than her husband 's . " Your grandfather go to Eton ? " she echoed . " Yes , he did , Peter . " " Adrian , " Peter asked his father promptly , " when am I going to Eton ? " Adrian plunged round in his chair in the familiar family manner . The Sunday Times crackled to the floor . " Tau ? Eton ! " He glared at his son . Then slowly , stiffly , he dragged himself out of his chair , walked a yard toward his son ; and when Adrian walked a yard that yard always looked as though it might be his last . " Did I hear you asking when you were going to Eton ? " he said sternly . " Yep , Father  --  why the hell not ? " " Do n't you call me Father , " Adrian said angrily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from both sides of his head all over his white face . " You 're never going to Eton , Peter , " said Adrian firmly . " Better let that sink into your head now . It 's too old , too big , and too bad a school . A public school anyway is an anti-social institution , hear ? " " Well , " Peter began , " I 've got to learn something some ? " " There 's only one lesson to be learned , Peter , " said his father , " and that 's to think . I was four years at Eton and all I acquired was a horror of women and how not to spend money . " " I have n't got any money , " said Peter bitterly , " and ? " " Nor have I , " interrupted Adrian , and he collapsed again into his chair as though some unseen hand had pushed him into it . " Why did you go to Eton , Adrian ? " asked Peter , after a pause . " Shish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reading . He went to Eton because his father sent him . " " Why did his father send him if it 's old and big and bad ? " " Well , dear , it was n't always old and big and b ? " " What you say , Vera ? " Once more Adrian plunged in his chair . " Eton was always old and always big and always bad . My father sent me there simply because he went there himself and because he did n't think . And he did n't think partly because he went to Eton . " " Does no one think if they 've been to Eton ? " " Very few , " said Adrian . " If they do they 're fanatics . I prove the rule . " At mention of his grandfather Peter glanced up again at the photograph of the late Colonel Winter . " What was Grandpop like , Adrian ? " he asked after a moment 's pause . " Grandpop  --  Grand  --  oh , my father , you mean ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted Vera , " your father was n't a bit little ! " " Well  --  actually , he was n't , you 're right  --  but the older he got the smaller he seemed to become . What was he like ? Oh , he was very nice , you know exactly like hundreds of others round here . Well , he was a very wicked man , extremely amoral . His greatest joy in life was to kill things . Ooh , what a little murderer he was ! Four days in the winter weeks he used to put on a red coat  --  symbolic , I thought  --  get on a horse , and with a whole pack of strange-looking dogs , gallop across the country after one small fox . The peculiar thing was I often heard him speak quite lovingly of foxes . If the dogs killed the fox after careering across country for about an hour he 'd say what an excellent fox that had been , what a pity he was dead , but what damn fine fun it had been driving him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck or common sense to dive down a drain before he 'd gone a field , your Grandpop , as you call him , grew furious and called that fox art extremely dirty brute . " Peter was sitting up very straight , his lips apart , eyes wide with excitement . " But bad foxes or good foxes , " Adrian continued , " I remember that he always came home , ate two huge meals within a few hours of each other , and then settled down to tell your Grandmother what a wonderful fellah he was . Actually he was one of a band of Englishmen who were  --  still are  --  the very wickedest of men . . . . " " Really , Adrian , " interrupted his wife , " is n't that a rather distorted picture ? " " Not at all , darling , " said Adrian in his superior manner that Vera hated . " Peter asked what his grandfather was like . If men arc to be judged by their deeds , these were his . Now , let 's see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Saturdays he killed rabbits : he had a man who stuck ferrets down a hole , and if the ferret did n't eat the rabbits underground they usually bolted out of another hole , whereupon Grand-pop would raise his gun and blow bunny to bits . I heard him once vulgarly call that practice ' corking sport . ' " " What about Sundays ? " asked Peter , quickly . " Ah , Sunday , " groaned Adrian . " Poor Grandpop , that was a dreary day for him  --  for he had always made the greatsacrifice never to commit murder on the Sabbath . Instead , he used to moon about and look for bills to pay till the Church bells began to ring , and then he and your Grandmother set out very slowly , very smartly dressed , very silently , with Prayer Books , to the village church . He never missed a Sunday  --  a very religious man , as he always said of himself . I often think he was not unlike Rasputin , whose belief it was that you must sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute Peter had not heard a word his father said , for he had been listening intently to some strange sound like a trumpet being blown in the distance . At last his curiosity overcame him and he rushed from the room . " Where 's he gone ? " said Vera . " Oh , I do n't know , " said Adrian , with indifference . " Probably up to his room to use those new paints you gave him . He 's intelligent , that boy ; got the right ideas all right  --  he might do anything . Interesting to watch him develop . " " / must say , " said Vera , " he seemed awfully interested in what you were telling him about your father . " " Of course , dear , " said Adrian , a little patronizingly . " You see , if you 're not dogmatic with children , do n't force things down their throats , just treat them as equals and intelligent human beings , then you get them to listen , and you also earn their respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by humorous if slightly sarcastic implication , you not only force them to think , but you steer them away from the wrong manner of thinking , mold their thoughts along the lines of your own . No , Peter will have a chance , start early . None of this mucking about with Latin and Greek till he 's nearly twenty years old . " Adrian paused and , locking up , found his wife smiling . He was suddenly hot with anger . " Why , what the blazes &you; find funny ? " he shouted , and for a moment his face assumed an extraordinary resemblance to that of the late Colonel Winter . " Oh , darling , " laughed Vera affec-tionately , " you are screamingly funny sometimes , you know ! If only you could see and hear yourself ! You 're so horribly cocksure , such a thorough little theorist , are n't you ! ' Not dogmatic , ' you say ! Heavens , you 're the most dogma ? " " Me ! Dogmatic ! " Adrian was on his feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d' you  --  I-I-er-I ? " " Darling , " Vera interrupted quietly , " I think if you did n't feel a little guilty you would n't get quite so angry ? " At that moment Vera saw the door suddenly open . Cyril Potts , thirty-seven years butler at Hambledon House ( and now one of only two servants ) , stole in . " Any more letters for the post , sir ? " Silence . " Any more letters for the post , sir ? " " Adrian , dear  --  Potts wants the post . " Adrian , still striding up and down the room in silent , oblivious anger , came to an abrupt halt . " What ? " he shouted at his wife . " What rot are you talking now ? " " The post , Adrian . " He looked up . " Potts ! " he screamed . " Potts  --  ooh , you 'll be the death of me ! Post , post , post  --  how many times must I tell you I do n't write letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things myself ! Why d' you come and pester me every evening with post , post , post ? " When there came no more answer than a silent , expressionless stare from the haggard face of Potts , Adrian 's burst of irritation subsided ; he brushed back the hair from his face , and his appearance was at once one of shame and sorrow . " Oh , Potts , " he said sadly , " d' you realize we 've known each other all our lives and that you have n't smiled at me since the day when my pony ran away with me and I swore to the Colonel I 'd never again have anything to do with the beastly , hairy , four-legged brute ? " " Yes , sir , " said the old man without the flicker of an eyelid . " Is that all , sir ? " " Oh , Potts , " wailed Adrian hopelessly , " my poor , poor Pott ? " They were suddenly interrupted by the sound of loud voices outside in the hall . Adrian turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and together they stood listening , unaware of Potts ' somber countenance slowly relaxing and the mouth gradually giving way to a broad and almost terrifying , toothless grin . " By Jove ! " they heard one loud and hearty voice , " it 's the devil of a long time since I was here . I say , but the place has fairly gone to pieces since old Arthur  --  wonder what 's happened to that old Potts , the but ? " " My God , yes , " came another , " what a confounded mess it all is . They say this chap Adrian 's an absolute rot ? " " Hey , steady ! " warned a third , " this youngster who 's asked us in is his son , remember ai n't you , me lad ? And he says he 's going to join the regiment too ? stout fellah ! Ha , ha ! Well , well , where 's the whisky , I wonder  --  eh , young man ? " " This way , " said a small excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought we 'd kill that fox  --  damn fine piece of hound work  --  eh , what ! " Adrian and Vera stood aghast , their eyes staring , as though hypnotized , at the door . Suddenly it was pushed wildly open and Peter rushed in , his eyes shining and his cheeks scarlet with smeared blood . " They killed him in the turnip field ! " he shouted in rapture . " Yes , by Gad ! " came from a large red form approaching behind him . " Very hell of a hunt  --  howjer do ! Fairly blooded your youngster , have n't they ! Tough little chap , got the real makings of a soldier ! Ha , ha . . . . By God , if this is n't old Potts ! Well , I 'll be damned ? just like old times ! " Cyril Potts , trembling with emotion and memories of faroff days , beamed silently , open-mouthed , on Peter Winter 's joyful face . Then from deep down in his throat there came a sound like a mouse squeaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not the turnip field , were the chamber of death .
