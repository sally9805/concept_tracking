On the Rashid Shari in Bagdad , a barefoot urchin cries his wares : Al Mukhtar Min Reader 's Digest . Sales are brisk . He will be sold out the second day . His success is another sensation of the sensationally successful U.S. Reader 's Digest ( domestic circ. 8,000,000 ) : a skyrocketing demand for its Arabic edition . <P> Only five months after its start , Al Mukhtar Min ( Selections From ) has reached its wartime circulation ceiling-125,000 copies . With adequate paper supplies , printing equipment and transport facilities , Reader 's Digest men think it might have reached to 200,000 in a few more months . In Egypt , Syria , Lebanon , Iraq and Saudi Arabia the natives swamp their dealers for this newest Digest foreign venture. * <P> Back to Front . In Cairo , Al Mukhtar sells for three piasters ( 12 cents ) . To help cover costs , the Digest reverses its U.S. policy , takes advertising . Among the advertisers : Glenn L. Martin and Vega Airplane , Higgins Industries , Parker Pen . At three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most Mid-Easterners ; at the Digest 's , U.S. price , 25 , there would probably be little circulation . <P> Also reversed in Al Mukhtar is makeup . Arabic is read from back to front , and from right to left ( but from top to bottom of pages ) . <P> Fuad Sarruf , journalism professor at the American University in Cairo , and a staff of 15 do the translating from the Digest into Al Mukhtar . The magazine is finally edited and laid out in the Digest 's Pleasantville ( N.Y. ) offices , returned to Cairo for printing . <P> Its format is the same as the U.S. edition 's but with only about 75% of its editorial content . At Pleasantville-to counsel on what would be of Arab interest and what might collide with Moslem taboos-is a group of five Arabic advisers , topped by Dr. Philip K. Hitti , acting chairman of Princeton University 's department of Oriental languages . <P> Al Mukhtar 's warm reception has encouraged the Digest to make postwar plans that will cover the Moslem world , from Morocco eastward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Moslem reader puts away his copy of Al Mukhtar against the day when his sons learn to read . <P> *Others : editions in Spanish , Portuguese , Swedish and one for Great Britain .
