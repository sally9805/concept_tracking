One sweltering night last week some 200 Senators and Representatives assembled in secrecy in the Caucus room of the Old House Office Building . In the darkness a film unreeled-without titles , without voices , with few sound effects . The Congressmen saw Nazi tanks push against concrete tank barriers , push them over as if they were so many tombstones . They saw dive bombers fire buildings with incendiary bombs . They saw nearly 100 parachute troops leap from three huge transport planes at an astonishingly low altitude . The film was an official German movie of the invasion of the Lowlands . There were few Germans shown in it-mostly a vast collection of tanks , planes , armored trucks . It was a picture of mechanized war , in which the visible human beings were a mass of dead bodies , a fierce-looking group of captive French Senegalese troops . <P> Congressmen were not exactly shaken by the movie . But some of them were mad . Somebody remembered that Norwegian Parliament members had been shown gory German pictures of the Polish invasion just before Nazis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " pure propaganda and I 'd like to know whose . " Newsmen had no trouble finding out who had arranged the showing-dumpy , bespectacled Ross Collins of Meridian , Miss. , who for 15 of his 18 years in Congress has been plumping for mechanization of the Army . For 14 of those years drawling Representative Collins made no progress , used to complain : " I do n't seem to have convinced anybody but Hitler . " <P> When Hitler began to mechanize the German Army in a big way , Representative Collins plumped harder than ever , buttonholed his colleagues to tell them one story over &; over : a group of U. S. Army officers , razzing a visiting German general a few years ago about Germany 's plans for world domination , pointed out Germany 's small forces , the enormous man power of the rest of the world . Snapped the baited general : " The wolf does not care how many sheep are in the pasture . " <P> Fortnight ago a newsreel company got hold of the German film , decided it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , invited Representative Collins to take a look . Each Nazi demonstration of the weakness of flesh against battle wagons convinced Collins that the picture would show Congressmen how mechanization worked , as his words never could . Two days after they had seen the film , Representative Collins , stubborn as Cato , asked for the floor to deliver his favorite speech . This time colleagues filled the Congressional Record with flowery praises and apologies . Representative Collins ' text : The wolf does not care how many sheep are in the pasture .
