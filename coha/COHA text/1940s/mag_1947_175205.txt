Madrid belonged to Evita last week . Not since the welcome to Hekirich Himmler in 1940 had the Franco regime tuned up a reception as thunderous as the one it handed the dashing blonde wife of Argentina 's President Juan Pern . Evita drew even larger crowds than had ever turned out for Dictator Franco himself . " Of course , " went the explanation , " she 's better looking . " <P> The fact was that Madrid 's enthusiasm was real , not the synthetic show that Madrilenos are accustomed to giving for Franco . The 200,000 who lined Madrid 's floodlit streets on the night of her arrival knew that Evita-and Argentina-stood for the wheat in their bread . As they saw more of her , on balconies , in the theater , at the bull ring , they learned that she had a way with a Spanish crowd . <P> That way consisted of an adroit plugging of the common bonds of religion and blood which unite Spaniards and Argentines . It also involved some fancy costuming . It was the hottest day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabel la Catlica from Dictator Franco ; but she wore a full-length mink cape . At the special performance of Lope de Vega 's classic Spanish drama , Fuente Ovejuna in the Teatro Espaol , Evita turned up in a long cape of ostrich feathers . At the bullfight , which she held up half an hour by arriving late ( the opening was never delayed for Alfonso XIII ) , Evita again bugged Spanish eyes . She wore her mantilla ( traditionally held rigorously straight ) over a comb cocked rakishly above her ear . <P> True &; False ? Her words fell sweetly on the ears of Franco and his followers . To 40,000 Madrilenos who jammed into the Plaza de Oriente , Evita praised the " true , distributive democracy " of Spain and Argentina . She contrasted it with the " false , deceptive democracy " of other unnamed nations . The crowd roared encouragement , then slowly , beginning with a core of falangistas in the center of the square , raised arms in the officially abolished Fascist salute . Evita , and the Dictator at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had another week in Spain before she went on to Rome for a quieter round of functions , including an audience with the Pope and a banquet with Foreign Minister Carlo Sforza . Then she would go on to France and England-where she was already getting catcalls from the press . The Socialist Party has urged French Premier Paul Ramadier to declare her unacceptable . And London 's big , breezy Sunday Pictorial , which was howling at Argentine beef prices , screamed from a frontpage banner , PRESIDENT 'S WIFE is NOT WELCOME . But Evita was used to brickbats ; they had not stopped her before .
