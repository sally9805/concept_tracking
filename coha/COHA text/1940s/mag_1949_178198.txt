When France is in the throes of forming a new government , the spectacle is undignified , sometimes dangerous and a severe physical tax on the men involved at the core of it . For three days 54-year-old Ren Mayer , last week 's unsuccessful premier-designate , did not eat a decent meal . From morning until late at night he conferred hectically with party leaders . At intervals he replenished his energies with crackers and chocolate bars from a desk drawer . <P> After the resignation ( TIME , Oct. 17 ) of the Radicals ' Henri Queuille ( because of Socialist contumacy ) , President of the Republic Vincent Auriol had called on Socialist Jules Moch , a hard-hitting Minister of Interior in the Queuille regime , to see what he could do . By the narrowest margin in French parliamentary history , Moch had been approved by the Assembly , but he could not form a cabinet . It seemed that neither of the other two parties in the center coalition , the Radicals and Popular Republicans , wanted a Socialist premier . Then long-suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Middle-of-the-roader Mayer won a fairly comfortable Assembly ratification , but he also was unable to form a cabinet , largely because the Socialists resented the frustration of M. Moch . M. Auriol next wistfully beckoned to an eminent Popular Republican , Georges Bidault , first Foreign Minister of the Fourth Republic . M. Bidault would undoubtedly exert himself to the utmost , for of the three center parties the Popular Republicans have the sharpest fear of parliamentary dissolution and new elections ( the Popular Republicans anticipate wholesale defections to the Gaullists ) . By a majority vote the deputies could bring about dissolution at any time , and the longer the crisis went on the closer came the specter of dissolution . <P> <P> *Not to be confused with doctrinaire Socialist Daniel Mayer , no kin .
