SCENE It is dawn . Birds twitter from the woods . A rooster crows lustily from offstage , and is answered by another . The Squaro is silent and deserted . Snores can be heard from the houses nearest the footlights . LONNIE ( Enters upstage left . He has a heavy stick and raps on the porch of the house closest to where he enters and chants ; ) Wake up , Jacob ! Get on the rock Taint quite day , but its five oclock !

If you ai nt made it by now , you better wait till night again . Git on up ! ( Leaps off porch grinning ) ( A hum in harmony follows his chants now . The camp is stirring . Lonnie is down at the footlights . He makes a last general call ) All up , bullies ! Unlessen you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right ) I done called you once ! I done called you twice ! ( He holds the hum of his last syllable until he disappears off right . The lights have come up gradually , but not very much ) p. 3 ROOSTER ( Crows , flaps wings , begins to strut as his flock of hens follow him on ) HEN Ground cold to my feet this morning . I wish I had some shoes . ROOSTER ( Doing a love dance around her ) What did the rooster say to the hen ? Ai n't had no loving in the Lord knows when .

You get just as much out of it as I do . Aw , cutta-cut cut ! ( He leads them off between the houses clucking disgustedly ) ( Lights are up in kitchens . The wooden shutters are open .

Stacking the deck , and carrying the cub and everything . I would have kilt Nunkie so dead that he couldnt fall over . They would have to shove him over .

I just leaves my hull around here making motions , and you all thinks that I am here . SOP-THE-BOTTOM Thats a good thing , too , cause if the Boss ever figured you even got far enough off the ground to crack your heels , he sure would dock you for the time you was up in the air . ( They all agree to this and laugh ) p. 9 STEW BEEF Aw , let the man tell us what Heaven was like . Thats what I wants to hear about . ( General clamor ) LONNIE Tell you when we get to work .

I shacked up with a woman once that was so contrary she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldnt find no way to stretch out comfortable to sleep . DO-DIRTY Yeah , and I done been with some that pulls bed-covers . Wont let you stay covered up . Them kind of women do nt look like they know what you bought a bed for . They think its some place to lay up and study evil . ( All laugh ) p. 11 LONNIE You telling the truth . I done seen ' em dreaming . They do nt never dream about roses and scenery and sunshine like a sweet woman do . Naw , they dreams about hatchets and knives and pistols , and ice-picks and splitting open people 's heads . I done seen ' em dreaming it ! ( There is a wild burst of laughter at this ) SOP-THE-BOTTOM Lonnie ai nt lying . I had one like that down round Tampa one time . I tried hard to be good to that woman , but she wouldnt let me . Bought her shoes for her feet , and a brand new wig for her head . But she used to hump up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and droam about killing folks every night . Go to bed evil and get up evil .

" " Let your head go bald " Man , I grabbed it , and I was out and gone . Left her without a dust of meal or flour . ( They all laugh in approval ) Dicey put me in the mind of Mary more than anybody I ever seen . Just wont agree with nobody or nothing . Why , I seen Mary get into a fuss with a signboard one day . We was coming long the road and a signboard said Sweetheart Soap . Mary stopped and called the signboard a liar ! Said it was Octagon Soap . ( They all laugh loudly ) LONNIE I better go see where My Honey is . I woke him up , but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dozed off again . p. 12 DO-DIRTY Lets all go wake up the rascal .

He flings her off , but she attacks again grabbing hold of the pocket of his jumper and winding her hand in it and fointing at his middle with her knife . Everybody is struck dumb for a moment by the suddenness of the attack ) Oh , Yeah ! ( Panting ) I got you ! Trying to duck and dodge from me , but I got you ! p. 27 MY HONEY ( Recovering his faculties somewhat , struggles to broak the hold ) Git away from me , Dicoy ! Is you gone crazy in the head ? ( Flings her off again so hard that she is off balance ) I do nt want to hurt you . Why do nt you leave me alone ? DICEY LONG ( Seeking an opening ) I 'll fold your dying arms for you ! ( Big Sweet is tensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favorable moment as she makes threatoning motions with her knife at My Honey ) Trying to scorn me ! I wont stand a quit . I mean to cut you just as long as I can see you . BIG-SWEET ( Darts in and grabs Dicey 's uplifted right hand and wrosts the knife away . Dicey gives a short scream of fright as she fears that Big Sweet means to cut her with it . But Big Sweet looks at it good , closes it , and puts it in her pocket ) DICEY LONG Gim me back my knife ! I mean to stick my knife in him and pull it down . Gim me my knife ! My money paid for it . BIG-SWEET ( Calmly ) Naw , I better keep it . You doing too much talking about cutting folks to death these late days . You keep on flourishing that old free around here , and somebody is going to hurt you . p. 28 DICEY LONG ( Rushes back and grabs hold of My Honey ) ( She tries to hit him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoving her off . DICEY LONG I mean to kill you and go to jail for you . MY HONEY Why do nt you leave me be , Dicey ? I done told you I do nt want no parts of you . Behave yourself ! ( There is a strong growl among the males ) SOP-THE-BOTTOM Its a good thing it ai nt me , she 's pulling on . God knows I 'd get her to go . She better not never draw no knife on me . LONNIE ( Angrily ) I do nt believe in knocking lady people around like I would a man , but if I was God , I sure would turn Dicey into a hog , and then I would cement the world all over , so she wouldnt have a damn place to root . DICEY LONG ( Furiously to Lonnie ) You keep your big mouth out of me and My Honey 's business . Thats what the matter now  - -  -  me and him was getting along fine till you had to go tole him off and turn him against me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a heap more round here if they mess with me . LONNIE Big Sweet , why do nt you talk some sense into this crazy fool ? You know My Honey ai nt got no more use for her than he is for his baby shirt . She 's just taking advantage because he wont knock her down like some mens would . ( To Dicey ) Turn My Honey go ! Take your hands off of his clothes ! p. 29 DICEY LONG Ai nt a'going to do it till I get good and ready . He ai nt going to quit me like I was some old dog . MY HONEY ( Tartly ) I ai nt never said I wanted you yet . You better wait till somebody ask-es you before you go claiming ' em . LONNIE ( Distressed ) How come we got to have all this changing words and disturbment ? How come everything cant go on nice and friendly ? BIG-SWEET ( Looks at Lonnie 's unhappy face , then interferes ) Lonnie is right . Taint no use in all this who-struck-John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nt learnt better about a lot of things since I been with Lonnie . ( Kindly to Dicey ) Dicey , on the average , I am for the women folks , because the mens take so much undercurrents of us . But , Dicey , My Honey 's case done come up in your court . He ai nt fooled you and mistreated you . All he ever done was joke with you a time or two . He done told you he do nt want you . I wouldnt want no man that did nt want me . Pulling after a man that do nt want you , is just like peeping in a jug with one eye . You cant see a thing but darkness . Take a fools 's advice and leave the man alone , like Lonnie say . MY HONEY ( Sullenly ) I done tried and tried to tell her that . But look like her head is hard . p. 30 STEW BEEF I sure would soften it up for her , if it was me . LONNIE I never did choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Full of self pity ) Why you all want to doubletoon on me ? Always faulting me for everything . I cant even talk to my gentleman friend without everybody got to dip in . MY HONEY If you talking about me , you ai nt got none . You 'll never snore in my ear if I can help myself . DICEY LONG I know I ai nt yellow , and ai nt got no long straight hair , but I got feelings just like anybody else . Go on , treat me mean if you want to , but someday , you all going to wish you had of treated me right . ( Exalted ) I 'm going to be propaganda ! Everybody going to be talking about me . Mens is going to scream over me more'n they ever did over Ella Wall , going to make up songs about me too and they going to talk about me more'n they do about Big Sweet . LONNIE How you going to bring all that about , Dicey ? DICEY LONG I 'm going go git me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button and the blade fly open , and I 'm going to make me a graveyard of my own . ( As if visualizing ) I 'm going to cut everybody that bother me . I 'm going to stick ' em just to see ' em jump . Carry me down to Bartow to jail and folks will come running from way off just to look at me . They 'll say , " There she is ! Thats Dicey , the one that kilt so many folks . Big Sweet ? What you talking about , man ? Big Sweet cant hold a light to Dicey Long . She 'll kill you without a doubt . Slice you too thin to fry . Shoot until her gun jumps the rivets ! Do nt care who it is and where it is , that Dicey Long will fight . She 'll shoot in the he arse , do nt care how sad the funeral is . Thats Dicey Long ! " ( In her reverie , she has released My Honey 's coat and made gestures of exaltation . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole heap of mens will be pulling after me . I 'm going to scorn him then . Tell him to come round another day . All of you all going to be trying to git in with me , but I aim to turn my nose up at you . I 'll be Miss Dicey Long , with finger rings and things . ( The whistle blows loud and long and the men respond automatically . Before Dicey realizes it , they are moving off and My Honey is out of her reach ) p. 31 LONNIE Come on boys ! Another day ! The work is hard , and the boss is mean . Can you make it . MALE CHORUS Yeah ! LONNIE Can you break it ? MALE CHORUS Yeah ! LONNIE Can you shake it ? CHORUS Yeah ! ! LONNIE All right , then ! Follow me , Bullies ( Chants ) Cutting timber ! Ha ! Cutting ties ! DICEY LONG ( Plaintive ) My Honey !

MY HONEY From since when till nobody knows . DICEY LONG Going to take me with you ? LONNIE Tell her , " no ! " Let every town furnish its own . DICEY LONG Where you figger on going ? MY HONEY Way up in Georgy . STEW BEEF Man , is you crazy ? Christ walked the waters just to go around Georgy , and you fool enough to go right in it ! p. 32 DICEY LONG ( Almost sobbing ) My Honey , tell me sure enough , if you go , when you coming back ? MY HONEY Not that it is any of your business , but I 'll be back some old cold rainy day . ( The second whistle blows short and sharp ) LONNIE Let 's go ! ( They all make motions of leaving ) STEW BEEF Let 's go ! The work is hard and the boss is mean . ( Sings ) Asked my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwed his watch away . LONNIE ( Entering into the spirit of kidding bossmen ) Cap'n ca n't read and cap'n ca n't write How the hell do he know when the time is right ? MY HONEY Cap'n got a pistol and he try to play bad but I 'm going to take it if he makes me mad DO-DIRTY My Honey , you better not take that box . Did n't Cap'n tell you not to bring it on the job no more ? MY HONEY I ai n't got that man to study about . I takes my music and my meaness everywhere I go . STEW BEEF Aw , you make the time , do n't you ? Play that box , man ! Give us something to walk on . Git with him Few Clothes . ( The men wave and yell back at the women who wave and yell at them and go off singing Cold Rainy Day . The animation in the women dies as the singing fades out . They are drab again , and begin to make slow motions of dispersal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the men when all other women have turned away . Big Sweet looks at her and grows sympathetic . She approaches Dicey , and starts to put her arms around her , but Dicey spurns her ) You old destruction-maker ! Taking My Honey away from me ! BIG-SWEET Nobody ai nt took him because he never was yours . DICEY LONG You did ! You did ! You and that Lonnie , and you more especial . Keeping him laying round your house night and day . I 'm going to get even with you for it too . I 'll put Ella Wall on you ! BIG-SWEET Ella Wall ai nt my Mama . I ai nt a bit more scared of her than I is of you . And then again , what I got to be scared about ? Ella Wall ai nt no big hen 's biddy , if she do lay gobbler 's eggs . DICEY LONG You 'll find out . You done more than Lonnie think you done to git My Honey away from me , and keep him tied up round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Thats a lie ! I called you a liar . You do nt like it , do nt you take it . Here 's my collar , come and shake it ! ( The atmosphere becomes tense . The others crowd around expecting action . Dicey backs off cringing ) DICEY LONG Your time now , be mine after while . BIG-SWEET So be it in the grand lodge . CURTAIN p. 34 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE It is late afternoon . The sun is strong in the Square . Housework is done and suppers are cooked and waiting for the men to return . Women have changed into clean cotton housedresses , well starched , and sitting around on porches . Several large boys and frying-size girls are out in the Square playing **27;186;TOOLONG , as the women sit around and patch , or here and there two or three " visit " on the porch of a neighbor . A boy about fifteen is the Crow . A girl about the same age is the hon. MAUDELLA All right , Alwishus , you be the Crow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but do nt make out I did nt catch you when I did . GIRL Aw , go on and get ready . ( Alwishus gets a stick about the size of a large pencil and squats in the center of the play area . The girls form in line behind the Mama Hen , each holding the girl in front around the body , of by her dress in the back , and start the march around the Crow chanting.Chick mah chick mah craney crow Went to the well to wash my toe When I come back my chick was gone What time , Old Witch ? ALWISHUS ( Making a mark on the ground ) One ! ALWISHUS ( Same business till the count is three . The Crow gots up and assumes a predatory posturo .

LEAFY LEE ( Enters from right . A slim mulatto girl with a cheap suitcase in her hand . Walking slowly and looking about her as if searching . It is hot , and she wipes her face . She is not discovered immediately because of the oxcitement of the play-dance . She watches the dance with interest a minute , then advances more rapidly. ) p. 36 CROW ( Working up to a high pitch ) My Mama 's sick ! HEN Let her die !

( All the women are out where they can listen and give each other significant glances on Leafy 's answers . ) DICEY LONG ( Calls over ) Er , Laura B. , Come here . Maybe I can tell you where Bunch went . ( Laura B. understands that Dicey wants to talk to her and gets up . Two or three other women head towards Dicey 's porch at the same time , including Bunch ) LAURA B. ( To Leafy ) You better step in the house and have a seat . It may be a little cooler in there .

Bunch do nt want nothing like that in her house causing disturbment . BUNCH Oh , you knowed her before ? DICEY LONG Not to speak to , but look like I seen her somewhere .

That do nt sound so bad . DICEY LONG ( Heated ) That ai nt nothing but a form and a fashion and a outside show to the world . She done heard about the money our mens makes on this job , and she done come in time to make a pay-day . Better git her on off from here before sundown and the mens come home from work . She 'll be after all us men before you can turn around . Lets git her way from here . p. 40 LAURA B. The Quarters Boss must have figgered she was all right , else he wouldnt have let her in here .

Here she come now , I sure is glad , because I sure do nt know what to do . BUNCH Me neither . I was going to tell Luara B. to bring her on over to my house , but if she is like Dicey say she is , I do nt want no trouble with Fow Clothes . LAURA B. None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . These mens do nt want to half do nohow . Its just like pulling eye-teeth to git a pair of shoes out of ' em .

You all got your head together like crows in a storm . ( They all motion her to hurry over ) ( Big Sweet crosses quickly and joins them without another word ) The law in here hunting somebody ? DICEY LONG ( Very friendly ) Its a woman . A fan-foot . LAURA B. Oh , we ai nt so sure about that part yet . But its a young , real high yaller --  I got her in my house till we can find out what to do about her . The Quarters Boss give her a note to Bunch to stay with her .

Big Sweet and Laura B. lead the way with the others following slowly so as to appear just to happen up in time to see the show ) LAURA B. ( At her porch , and in a low tone ) She do nt look bad to me . If Dicey had nt of said --  --  --  p. 42 BIG-SWEET ( Grimly ) Call her out . ( She rests her left foot on the steps , and her loft elbow on her left thigh . ) ( The voices of Leafy Lee and Maudella can be heard in gay talk and laughtor inside ) LEAFY LEE Well , I went up on that meat-skin And I come down on that bone And I grabbed that piece of cornbread And I made that biscuit moan . See , I got it right that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) LAURA B. ( At door ) That Maudella is too fast and womanish . ( Proudly ) She ai nt scared of nothing !

( The other women are drifting up and around the porch . ) LEAFY LEE Leafy is my name . Leafy Lee . ( Coming to door ) Is it Miss Bunch done come ? ( Sees Big Sweet . Big Sweet looks Leafy over from head to foot slowly and diliberately , and back again . There is either hostility or cold indifference in the faces of every woman about her , as Loafy stands there on the porch and takes in the circle . Finally she meets Big Sweet dead in the eye . They eye-ball each other well , then Leafy breaks into a grin ) p. 43 BIG-SWEET ( Tries to hold her solemn pose , but she also begins to grin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bigger as she and Leafy expand their smiles . Finally Big Sweet gives in , takes her foot down , stands akimbo and with an attempt to conceal her admiration under rough good humor ) You crazy thing ! LEAFY LEE ( Laughing , imitates Big Sweet 's stance ) Crazy your ownself . ( The women look from one to the other in amazement ) BIG-SWEET Youse all right , Little Bits . Taint nothing wrong with you . I been told you was stuck up and color struck , but youse all right . You grins natural . If you was stuck up you would try to smile . ( They both laugh at that ) Where you come from and where you going ? ( All listen intently ) LEAFY LEE Well ; I come from New York , but I wasnt born up there . Mama and Papa is both dead , so I had to go for myself . Folks always told me I could sing , and I ever wanted to sing like Ethol Waters . But I havent had no real good job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and next thing I knew , I was way down here . They told me if I wanted to learn to sing Blues right , I ought to come learn how on a saw-mill job , so I heard about here , and come on . The Bossman says I can stay here and learn all I want to . So he sent me to Miss Bunch to get myself a room . But she is away from home somewhere . I 'm waiting for her to come . p. 44 BIG-SWEET ( Dawning happiness , though hard to believe ) You mean you want to sing Blues --  sure enough Blues ? LEAFY LEE Thats right . Maybe I can make something out of myself if I do . Go back to New York and make enough money to take care of myself . BIG-SWEET Well , you done come to the right place . What name did you say you was going by ? LEAFY LEE ( Surprised ) What name I 'm going by ? The one my Mama give me when I was born . Leafy , Leafy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Specially when its yourn for real . Folks on these kinds of jobs uses different names at different times . I see what you come here for . You come here for a reason , and not for a season , and Leafy , you done come to the right place . Me and my man sings them Blues every night at our house . And we got a friend man that cold picks ' em on a guitar . If he cant whip a box , taint a hound dog in Georgy , and you know thats the puppies range . LEAFY LEE Well you all the very people I want to meet up with . I wants to sing the Blues . BIG-SWEET ( Grabs Leafy by the hand and pulls her down off the porch ) Come on go home with me so we can talk some . You ai nt got a bit more sense than me and Lonnie got . I loves to meet up with folks that loves good singing . ( The whole atmosphere has changed to warmth . Everybody is beaming on Leafy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 LAURA B. And Big Sweet sure can sing them Blues . When she gits hold of a good one , she turn it every way but loose . She 's the one can help you out a lot . LEAFY LEE ( Happily , then checks herself ) But if I go off with you , I 'll miss Miss Bunch , then I wont have no place to stay . BUNCH Did you say Bunch ? Here I is . I thought all the time you was asking for Lena Branch . But you said Bunch , did nt you ? You can git your suitsatchel and come on cross the way right now . I got a good room you can use . BIG-SWEET ( Picking up the bag ) She going home with me for awhile . This child ai nt after nobody 's man . Anyway , I do nt figger on nobody taking Lonnie away from me . Come on Little Bits . You going home with me . LAURA B. ( Calling after them as they start upstage , left ) Me and Stew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And me and Few . BIG-SWEET Thats right , you all come on and make the poor child feel welcome . You see she 's a orphan child . Everybody come on . Do nt look to cat up none of our groceries , but we going to have plenty music , and cut Big Jim by the acre . ( Big Sweet and Leafy go off chatting happily . The others watch them go . Dicey alone looks unhappy and stands looking after them grimly . CURTAIN p. 46 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE : Interior of Big Sweet 's house . TIME : Immediately after Scene 2 . Raw , unpainted lumber with rafters and uprights showing . Furniture cheap and the decor garish . Bright colored calenders and advertisements nailed on wall . Watermel on pink calico curtains at the two windows . White iron bedstand in one corner with starched lace fringed pillowslips and a cheap spread . Three kitchen chairs and a cheap wooden rocker with a lace doily . At the rise , Big Sweet and Leafy are discovered in the front room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rocker , She has removed her hat and dress , and is cooling off in her underwear . There is an easy air of old acquaintance between them . BIG-SWEET Its a wonder that your boy friend let you come off by yourself like this . LEAFY LEE I havent got no fellow . BIG-SWEET Whats the matter ? You all had a falling out ? LEAFY LEE ( Shakes her head slowly ) Never had one  --  not no real one . BIG-SWEET ( Astonished ) How you mean ? You look round twenty years old to me . LEAFY LEE Twenty-too . BIG-SWEET Whats the matter ? Is you been sick , or something ? p. 47 LEAFY LEE Oh , I had fellows to come take me out to the moving pictures and things like that onco in a while . And one fellow , he liked me real well , but I did nt care nothing about him . He even went and asked Papa for my hand . BIG-SWEET Your hand ? What did he want with that ? LEAFY LEE Why , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Papa for my hand . BIG-SWEET How come he did nt say what he mean , instead of go asking for your hand ? LEAFY LEE Thats what you say when you want to marry a girl . BIG-SWEET ( Loud and embarrassed laughter ) Is that what they say when they want to shack up with a gal ? When they feel they love come down ? LEAFY LEE Thats the proper way . BIG-SWEET ( Dumbfounded ) Umph ! Umph ! Umph ! That just go to show you how bad it is to be ignorant . But , when you do nt know , you do nt know . Here , all this time these ignorant mens being going round here asking folks for they can when they ought to be asking for they hand . The no-manners-ted things ! ( Indignant ) I better not hear no more of that kind of talk round here . They better not say can to me no more , even if its got tomatoes in it . ( Deep respect and awe comes over Big Sweet and a wistfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows a heap of good things : LEAFY LEE Oh , that ai nt nothing much to know . BIG-SWEET I think its fine . Wisht I had of knowed that long time ago . ( A minute of deep thought : ) You mean you ai nt never knowed nothing about no man ? LEAFY LEE Thats right . ( Apologetically ) Maybe its because I have never been in love with nobody that was in love with me : BIG-SWEET ( In awe ) You ai nt joking ? LEAFY LEE ( Embarrassed ) No ma'am . I ai nt never given to no man : BIG-SWEET I nover expected to find nothing like that sure enough . ( She leans her head against the bedpost with a far-off bitter look on her face and thinks ) I 'm glad for you , Leafy . Cause you done won the battle that I lost : LEAFY LEE What do you mean by that ? BIG-SWEET I wanted to be a virgin my ownself . I always said that I was going to be one till I got married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . That was my firm determination . Course I did nt know what his name was going to be , but I knowed that I was going to find Lonnie some time or other . And I often wish that I could have come to him like you is now . ( A deep , long sigh ) No use wishing now . Them years is behind the mountains . I think that I would have made it too , but you see , Papa died when I was fifteen , and times got mighty hard . It was too expensive for some-body in the fix I was . I couldnt afford to be a virgin . ( Pause ) Then , after that , I got to knocking around , and found out what folks mean by careless love . You mean good , and think maybe it will lead to something permanent . But he hits you a love-lick and be gone ! So when you get through thinking and feeling , you try another one . Pretty soon , you be feeling again like you been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out its a lot of bulldozing , imposing and biggity folks in the world that loves to take advantage . They looks fine from the top of their heads down , but if you see ' em from the foot up , they 's another kind of people . They sings and says that the water in Polk County taste like cherry wine . So I come pulling here like a heap more girls done done . ( A bitter laugh ) Well , after while , I met up with Lonnie , and then things was all right . But by that time , I had done got my craw full of folks doing they bullying and buldozing and trompling on everything and everybody they could git they foot upon . p. 49 LEAFY LEE ( Rushos across to Big Sweet and flings her arms about her ) You make me feel so little . Just being a virgin ai nt a thing besides what you are , honey . BIG-SWEET ( Wraps Leafy in a tight embrace ) Oh , you going to be a lot of help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEAFY LEE But you knows the most . Mama used to always tell me that study-ration beat education all the time . BIG-SWEET ( Laughs heartily ) And thats right , too in a way . We can sort of swap : You do nt know a thing about this world , but I aim to put my wisdom tooth in your head . I mean to be your fore-runner like John the Baptist . Fight everything from graybeard to battle height . LEAFY LEE You mean you really fights ? BIG-SWEET Yeah , I has to sometimes . Some folks ai nt going to do right unlessen you do . I do nt mean no harm , but one day about six years ago , me and God got to sort of controversing on the subject of how some folks loves to take advantage of everybody else . He said that sure was the truth , and He never had meant it to be that a'way . Preaching and teaching did nt do some of ' em no good . Jailing ' em did nt help ' em none , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just needed they behinds kicked . p. 50 LEAFY LEE Did God tell you to kick ' em BIG-SWEET ( Laughing ) Well , Ho did nt exactly tell me to kick ' em , but He looked down at my big feets and smiled . LEAFY LEE So you been kicking ' em , eh ? ( Laughing ) BIG-SWEET Sure is , and its done a heap of ' em good . I done made over this place more nearly like Lonnie say it ought to be . No need in all this fighting and carrying on every pay night . Pole cats trying to make out they 's lions ! LEAFY LEE Do nt hurt yourself too much for other folks .

( General clamor from the mon to the same effect ) LONNIE ( Drags the table a little away from the group by the wall towards center stage and stands leaning heavily on it with both hands while he laughs and laughs without mirth .

Save my money for another use . ( The crowd moves to the other card table noisily , and My Honey begins to pick absently on the box . Lonnie keeps his seat and fumbles with the cards . The pianist notes that My Honey is chording ( DAISIES WONT TELL ) and joins in . As the game is being organized , the crowd sings it first spottily , and then intensely on the chorus ) ( All of the men except Lonnie and My Honey are in the game . The women stand around behind them very interested and rooting for their own men . Lonnie is doing something with the cards that interests him .

DO-DIRTY ( Screws his face all up in a grimace that is meant to be very ingratiating and pleasing ) Yes Ma'am . ( The crowd howls as he does his act . Then he comes out of it ) That 's the way to talk to a pretty girl like you with all that Nearer-my-God-to-Theo hair .

( Looks at My Honey 's face seriously ) Do nt move out his chair for goodness shake . It will throw him into a three-weeks spasm . DICEY LONG ( Thrusting into the center of the group ) How come she cant move ? My Honey needs that chair more than she do . He got to set down to play , ai nt he ? MY HONEY ( Quickly to defend Leafy ) Aw , she ai nt keeping me from setting down if I want to . I can play if I wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just set and rest yourself , Miss Leafy . I loves to stand up anyhow . ( There is a tense feeling and silence for a minute . Everybody looks to Lonnie ) LONNIE Aw , table that talk . Leafy can set in any chair she will or may . They all belongs to the Bossman . If My Honey feels to stand up and let her set , thats his privilege . No need for all this who-struck-John about it . STEW BEEF Thats what I told her . ( Indicating Dicey ) p. 87 DICEY LONG ( Significantly ) Some folks better sweeps around they own door before they go trying to clean around mine . They got plenty to worry about they ownself . ( She throws Lonnie a triumphant look , and then purses her mouth in a knowing way .

LONNIE ( Laying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down again without speaking ) SOP-THE-BOTTOM ( Worried , but trying to be light ) Oh , leave the man alone . Maybe he 's just dreaming up something like he always do . STEW BEEF It cant be that , cause he always dream laughing . Something to make everybody feel good . He ai nt laughing now , and none of us do nt feel right . SOP-THE-BOTTOM Maybe its something deep this time . He might be way out on Ether 's blue bosom somewhere travelling around . Then he going to come back and tell us something to make our work seem easy , and our burdens seem light . DO-DIRTY Sure is the truth . This old saw-mill job seem just like New York with Lennie around . I wouldnt stay here a day if he was to leave . ( General agreement with this ) p. 88 DICEY LONG ( Laughs ) If some folks would mind they own business instead of moddling with mine , they wouldnt be in the fix they 's in . MY HONEY Aw , you always saying something nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dicey ) Shut up !

Its something wrong with him . ( Tenderly ) Whats wrong , Pudding-pie ? You ai nt going to keep nothing from me , I know . LONNIE ( Looks carefully at the arrangement of cards , but does not look up at Big Sweet , who tries to get into his line of vision ) PIANIST ( Begins to play softly and sing ) I 'd rather see my coffin come rolling in my door Than to hear my baby say she do nt want me no more . BIG-SWEET Lonnie , why you ! You ai nt even told me if I look good in my clothes or not . ( Piano keeps on in undertone ) LONNIE ( Picks up a card and regards it intently . Everybody crowds about him and big Sweet ) ( There is a dramatic wait , then Lonnie begins to read the deck ) Aco means the first time that I met you . Doune means there was nobody there but us two . Trey means the third party -- -Charlie was his name Four means the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years you played me for a clown Six means six feet of earth when the deal goes down .

( There is a moment of stunned silence as Lonndo and Big Sweet stand facing each other ) DICEY LONG ( Breaks into raucous laughter which convulses her ) Whatever goes over the Devil 's back is bound to buckle under his belly . ( People are so intent on Big Sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so she desists ) BIG-SWEET ( Approaches and tries to take Lonnie 's arm , but he jerks away ) What make you mention Three-Card Charlie ? LONNIE ( Hurt and belligerent ) Because you make me do it , thats why . That bed-bug ! BIG-SWEET Bed-bug ? Even so , what is Charlie being a bed-bug got to do with you and me ? LONNIE ( Vehement ) That is all he is , the scoundrel-beast , a bed bug .

What the Hell is the matter with you ? LONNIE I 'm a straight man , and believe in doing right . So , I ai nt got no time to fool with you , and neither take up no time with you .

What would us do ? ( There is a general feeling of helplessness and dismay ) BIG-SWEET ( Resolute , steps forward , waving the others back , she raises Lonnies chin and forces him to look at her ) Do nt you all worry . Lonnie is just talking , for some reason or another . ( To Lonnie ) You ai nt through with me Lonnie Price . p. 92 LONNIE ( Trying to resist her ) Oh , yes I is through with you .

( He shoves her away from him again ) p. 94 BIG-SWEET ( Smiling and hugging him again ) That was way year before last . LONNIE That do nt excuse you none . Year before last I was working for you and bringing you home my pay just like I got it from The Man just like I been doing ever since . BIG-SWEET But , Pudding-pie , what evil have I done ? Since some old sea-buzzard had to go tell a lie on me , I reckon I better tell you how it was . LONNIE And you better git it fixed , too . BIG-SWEET Baby , you know old Charlie always did have a pick at me . LONNIE That I know is so . But you always made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I done neither . Never did . Well , about two years back , he took to picking at me , and sending me messages how he love me so hard , and all that money he had in his pocket was for me , till I got up a real good feeling for Charlie . LONNIE ( Groans ) Do , Jesus ! BIG-SWEET So one time when he begged me so hard , I thought I might as well go down there and git all that money he had for me . LONNIE ( Groans and almost collapses on table , but Big Sweet makes him sit up again ) p. 95 BIG-SWEET Wait a minute , Sugar , lemme finish telling you how it was . So I went down to Mulberry , and met him where he told me to come . He was there waiting with his hair all slicked down and everything . Soon as my toe-nails crossed the door-sill , I told Charlie , " Gim me what you got for me . " He look like he did nt git the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had for me . So I asked him plain , " Is you got anything besides yourself ? " ( Emphatic with rage ) And Baby , you know that mink did nt have a dime to cry . When he told me that , Honey , you know that good feeling I had for Charlie took and left me right then and there , and I ai nt had it since . I turnt right round and come on home to you . LONNIE ( Jerks her roughly to him ) I dare him to send you anymore messages . I 'll give him a straightening if he do . BIG-SWEET ( Drops down in his lap and begins to fondle him ) Which one would you rather believe  - -  -  your baby , or that old lying letter ? LONNIE I rather to believe you , Baby . I loves you harder than the thunder can bump a stump . BIG-SWEET ( Snuggles down , and Lonnie 's hand unconsciously begins to caress her legs ) You see , Sugar , I did nt fly hot and go accusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you all the time like she been doing for the last longest . p. 96 LONNIE You do nt need to worry about Ella Wall and no other woman God over made . You got the keys to the kingdom . STEW BEEF ( Triumphant ) There now ! The mule done kicked Rucker ! BIG-SWEET ( Hands on her hips , self-assured and smiling ) What I put on you , Brother , soap and water wont take off . LONNIE All right , I admits to the truth . You done put me on the lingor .

LONNIE I do nt see how come . I been good to you as any man could be and I 'm asking you to be my wife . I aims to go with you and stand by you till I press a dying pillow . BIG-SWEET And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , Lonnie , you want us to be running and gitting married like common folks . Us got this big love that nobody ai nt never had be-fore . Us do nt have to run to the courthouse and git papers and witnesses to prove if we is guilty . Us got that big-fooling love for one another . If I go dragging you to the white folks , it wont look like I believe what you say . I ai nt never going to leave you , and I do nt aim to let you leave me , neither . So what we got to act scared about ? p. 97 LONNIE ( Happy ) I 'm mighty glad to hear you say we is never to part , Baby . I just figured me and you ought to make a example out of ourselves for Leafy and My Honey and the rest of these folks round here . BIG-SWEET Oh , its going to be plenty marrying going on round here first and last .

This place got to be fitten for somebody like Leafy to live in . STEW BEEF How come you cant lead off , then ? BIG-SWEET Do nt try to do as I do . You do as I say do . Most of you all wont tell the truth . Just like I told Leafy  --  she ai nt to believe a thing you all say after ten oclock at night , and nothing you promise no time on pay day . I know you . Youse a gang of minks . I ought to know you . I done summered and wintered with you , ai nt I ? And then again , I hauled the mud to make you .

But it sure is taking a lot of fun out of pay day . STEW BEEF ( Sighs heavily ) STEW BEEF Just cause you shack up with a woman now , you got to give her money . Umph ! Umph ! Umph ! SOP-THE-BOTTOM Its hard , but its fair . ( Looks at Leafy ) I might as well git married now and git used to things . LONNIE ( With an air of command and finality ) Yeah , the time done come when big britches got to fit little Willie . ( Takes Big Sweet 's arm affectionately ) Now , I can dream some more . Listen ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can fly off on the big wings . I can stand on other 's blue bosom . I can stand out on the a pox of power , Nobody can beat me doing what I 'm supposed to do , and nothing cant keep me down . I got my wings . I rides the rainbow . ( He stands exalted , and his mood touches all . The faint throb of a distant drum permeates the silence , and gradually draws nearer . First Lonnie smiles beatifically , then good humor and laughter spreads over the place ) p. 99 STEW BEEF Lonnie , youse a pistol ! You can make anybody feel good . You can make a way out of no-way , and hit straight with a crooked stick . BIG-SWEET That is how come I ever loves Lonnie . ( To Lonnie ) Come on , lets we go home and get our night rest . LONNIE ( Eagerly ) Thats the very corn I wants to grind . ( Rushes Big Sweet towards exit , right , downstage ) I got to speak to you pointedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tho othors clapping time with their hands , and exit ) ( The others come out of the mood and begin spreading over the place . BOX CAR ( Passing Dicoy puts his hand on her head ) Woll , Dicoy , you took and laughed too quick . Big Sweet and Lonnio did nt bust up like you was hoping . DICEY LONG ( Snatching away ) Keep your old nasty hands off my head ! I ai nt got Big Sweet and Lonnio to study about . SOP-THE-BOTTOM Oh , yos you is . You was cackling to beat the band , and urging it on . Thats how come I do nt like you --  always for a fuss . DICEY LONG Oh , nobody on this job do nt like me nohow. p. 100 BOX CAR Look like you do nt want nobody to like you , the way you do . DICEY LONG Yes , I do too .

Ella Wall , and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thats the place you ought to live , then Dicey -- -where folks friends with you . How come you do nt move down there ? DICEY LONG Naw , I ai nt going to move down there nothing of the kind . They will turn against me too . ( Musing ) Its a funny thing  - -   - -  - them that do nt know me good is just crazy about me , but them that knows me well ai nt got no use for me at all . STEW BEEF ( Chuckling ) Maybe its because they know you . ( There is a spontaneous burst of laughter ) DICEY LONG ( Instantly riled ) Thats right ! Laugh ! Like a passle of jackasses , You just wait till I see Ella Wall and my other friends . You 'll be laughing out the other side of your mouth , then . ( She starts furiously towards left exit . At the door she halts ) I 'll give you something to cackle over  --  you self-conceited dogs ! ( She vanishes out of the door instantly ) ( There is a light sprinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lets dance this thing off . Play that piano , boy ! I feels like a waltz . Miss Leafy , can I scorch you round the hall ? LEAFY LEE ( Hugging herself as if with cold , perches on the side of the table and looks nervously about her ) Not just now . Dicey  - -   - -   the way she looks at me  - -  -  she gives me the weak-trembles . BOX CAR ( Crosses to table and stands admiring Leafy ) Pay it no mind . Dicey been talking about cutting up everybody for the last longest . She ai nt crazy sure enough to think anybody is going to let her cut ' em and do nothing . Pay it no mind . LEAFY LEE ( Still nervous ) You sure about that , now ? The way she looks at me , nothing in the drugstore would kill me quicker than she would . MY HONEY ( Trying to get closest to Leafy ) I wouldnt stand round and let her hurt you , even if she had that in mind . LEAFY LEE ( Not too sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOX CAR Lets table this talk on Dicey and open up the house for new business .

Anything else you want to know there she is , ask her ! She can tell you what she want you to know . SOP-THE-BOTTOM Oh , you do nt have to git mad because somebody else want to talk with the lady . She 's a much-right , ai nt she ? Much-right for me as she is for you . MY HONEY There she is . Ask her your ownself . BOX CAR ( Diffident ) Miss Leafy , which would you ruther be , a lark a ' flying , or a dove a ' setting ? SOP-THE-BOTTOM He mean would you ruther be married or single ? LEAFY LEE ( Bridling ) Oh , you done asked me a hard question , Box Car . It all depends . BOX CAR Depends on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) It depends on whether I was in love or not .

My Honey approaches her puts down his guitar , she steps into his arms and they waltz into the crowd as the curtain falls ) CURTAIN@@ SCENE ONE MONTH LATER INTERIOR OF BIG SWEET 'S HOUSE Raw , unpainted lumber with rafters and uprights showing . Furniture whole , but cheap . The decor , garish . Bright-colored calenders and advertisements nailed on walls . Watermelon-pink curtains at the two windows . White iron bedstead in one corner with clean , starched lace trimmed pillowslips , and a cheap , slazy silk spread . Three kitchen chairs and a cheap wooden rocker with coarse lace antimacassar . At the rise , it is early night , and Big Sweet is in a loose wrapper arranging her hair for the street . She sings a light song as she dresses . She puts on her street shoes and stockings , adding proudly a pair of beribboned red garters . A silk dress is laid out on the bed , and she throws off her wrapper to put it on . But she whiffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sill and gets her wash cloth and wipes again , dusts herself with talcum , and arranges the dress carefully to go over her head without wrinkling . LONNIE ( Bursts in , his face lit up with happy excitement ) Sugar ! Sugar ! What you reckon ? ( He grins delightedly ) Old My Honey done got it out at last ! BIG-SWEET ( Dress still in her hands ) What ? p. 106 LONNIE He done got up the nerve and ask-ed Leafy for her hand . They 's going to git married sure enough ! BIG-SWEET ( Glorified ) No !

Everything is copasetty . BIG-SWEET ( Smiling ) That sly little hussy ! She must of knowed he was due to ask . No wonder she went off from here around sundown all dressed to death . Where they at , now ? p. 107 LONNIE Down at the cafe . Eating ice cream out the same spoon and grinning at each other like two glad dogs in a meat house . BIG-SWEET ( Laughs heartily ) They 's in Heaven now , Baby . They cant help it . LONNIE And My Honey done bought out the place with chocolate bars , and I reckon done started on the chewing gum by now . ( They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed ) You wasnt much better when we first got together . ( Crosses and kisses him lightly ) Remember that first time down behind the saw-mill ?

I seen right away I was going to love you . Man , I throwed you some waves the ocean ai nt never seen .

( Both laugh ) LONNIE Oh , I do nt know , when that big gut reach and grab that little one , they 'll scrabble up something to eat . BIG-SWEET But it would be more better if they stayed right here with us . LONNIE ( Delighted ) You do git hold of the best notions ! They got to stay right here . Anyhow , they going to be going to New York before long if Leafy have her way . She 'll die the death of a doodle-bug if them folks in New York do nt hear My Honey play that guitar .

BIG-SWEET ( Takes lead in chant and puts softly sung words to chant and the others follow her ) ( Humming ) I got my hands in my Jesus hands ( With Chorus ) I got my hands in my Jesus hands . LONNIE Panthers in the swamp . Moccasins round your feet all day . Standing in water . ( Chant grows intense but not loud . More fervent ) Trees falling on men and killing ' em . Saw liable to cut you in two . Sundown , nothing but these quarters to come to and keep on like that until you die . ( Chant dominates the pause with repetition of Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something wrong . But what can we do ? You do nt know and I do nt know , so I cant tell you . Just moving around in the cage . ( The chant comes out in the open , while Lonnie sits and looks off into space ) p. 133 BIG-SWEET Sawdust , even if it do shine sometime . ( The faint whisper of distant drums comes and Lonnie begins to smile . More and more . The others watching Lonnie 's face begin to smile too , as the drums become more audible ) LONNIE ( Smiling and chuckling ) What make me talk so disencouraged like ? Old John de Conquer would know how to beat the thing . ( Chuckles broadly ) Shucks High John could git out of things do nt care how bad they was , and finish it off with a laugh . ( The drums are very pronounced now , and some pat their feet , and in other ways accent the rhythn of the drums ) Big Sweet ai nt going nowhere . That Quarters Boss ai nt got no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that old Dicey say  - -   - -  -  LAURA B. Every lio she make up and tell . LONNIE I 'm going to make my left-here now . ( Chorus of " and we 're going when you go " ! ) STEW BEEF One day after you leave , there wont be a sould in the quarters LONNIE And I 'm going to be the one to tell the Big Boss my ownself . The man can wait till he git the straight of things , or else we all can go . If the Boss ruther for him listen to lies than for us to do his work , then we still can go . ( A great cheer goes up ) Tomorrow will tell the tale . ( The prayer-chant for victory takes up again ) p. 134 LONNIE ( Getting to his feet dramatically ) Something ought to be like we want it . We ai nt got nothing . We ai nt never had nothing . Our folks ai nt left us nothing . ( Chant dominates for a moment ) Six feet of earth when the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never asked for much . ( Chant over drums is repeated and variated till curtain ) CURTAIN@@ SCENE : FOLLOWING SATURDAY NIGHT INTERIOR OF DICEY 'S SHACK At the rise , the shack is empty . It is of the same crude construction as Big Sweet 's house , but little has been done here to relieve the raw unpainted lumber and careless structure . The bed is lumpy and covered by a worn , faded quilt . There is a small iron heater in the corner , down-stage , right . It needs polish . The bed is across the center of the wall upstage . Two or three shoddy dresses hang against the door , which is left . A cheap suitcase is under the edge of the bed . The thin curtains are only half , and hung on strings that sag . Two unpainted kitchen chairs , and a goods box covered with newspaper complete the furnishings of the room , except for a chipped slop-jar in the corner behind the door . There is no one in the room at the rise . One hears a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dicey opens the door and fairly leaps inside , looking back over her shoulder as she enters . DICEY LONG ( Shutting the door quickly and locking it ) I do nt reckon nobody seen me come in . ( She turns on the light above her head and looks all around the room furtively ) Better git all ready before Nunkie git here for me . ( Pulls suit-case from under bed and puts it on the bed and opens it ) Do nt want to forgit a thing ! When I leave here this time , this place wont never see me no more . p. 136 DICEY LONG ( She takes down the clothes from the door and hurriedly folds them into the bag . Picks up a cheap comb with some of the teeth missing , a box of talcum , and puts them in . Keeps looking about to miss nothing ) They can have this little old furniture . I cant tote it nohow . Crip owed the man for it anyhow . Let ' em git it . ( She suddenly remembers the package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ) Lord , I sure done want to forgit my regalia ! Got to have that with me tonight . ( Rushes to head of bed and lifts the corner of the mattress and takes out a " hand " a small bundle about three inches long sewed up in red flannel and regards it fondly ) Wouldnt that be awful if I was to go off and forgit my Mojo ? ( Regards it gloating ) It was fixed for me to conquer and overcome . Big Sweet do nt need to think she got no stuff for me --  --  not with the help I got . ( Thrusts it deep into her bosom and smiles ) The Voodoo-man and Ella Wall say it will sure do the work . ( Sees the small , cheap mirror on the improvised dresser and takes it and carries it to the bed . Starts to pack it , then sits down on the bed and studies her features in the glass . Feels her hair first , then passes her fingers over her face in concentration in the mirror ) How come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have that long straight hair like -- like --  Big Sweet got , and that Leafy ? They own looks like horse 's mane , and mine looks like drops of rain . ( Feels disgust , self-pity , then resentment ) And these mens is so crazy ! They ai nt got no sense . Always pulling after hair and looks . And these womens that got it is so grasping , and griping , and mean . They wants EVERYTHING  - -   - -  and they gits it too . Look like they would be satisfied with some ! Naw , they wants it all . Takes pleasure in making other folks feel bad . ( Hurls mirror into bag face down and slams it shut ) How come I got to be a swill barrel to take they leavings ? ( In utter revolt ) Things ought not to be that way . What do they do more'n me ? I wish they all was dead ! Wish I could cut ' em and mark ' em in they faces , till they all looks worser than me ! They acts like they thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brag on they selves in . ( She leans against the bed post and thinks aloud on life and what it has done to her and comes to her conclusions , because they are unsuitable , as she laments ) ( During the lament a dance group interpets Dicey 's dispair ) Pretty women ! How I hate their guts ! This talk about equality is nuts . Have I got an equal chance . With anything thats wearing pants ? I 'll tell the world , and Georgia too , taint so . ( Examines herself in mirror ) My looks is just a heavy load That sends me down a lonesome road And no one cares the way I have to go . ( Looks again in glass and sighs ) I ai nt a woman in a way Where men have anything to say Of love , and tenderness , and such . I 'm just another kind of mule -- - A bad exception to a rule So what I feel do nt seem to matter much . p. 137 DICEY LONG ( Conversation outburst of outrage at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweet for shooting them men ? Nothing ! Naw , with that hair and them looks , she could kill a thousand and they wouldnt care . Yeah , a pretty gal can kill a man And never sleep a night in can They 'll give her back her gun and let her go . But let an ugly gal like me So much as cripple up a flea And they will build a new and better jail The Judge and jury 'll sit in state And ponder grimly on my fate And give me time , I 've never seen it fail They wont try me by no law books They 'll see the crime right in my looks And sentence me according to my shape . There 'll be no mercy on the bench I 'll get a look thats meant to lynch Good riddance for a trashy , ugly ape . If Leafy Lee would shoot me dead And weigh me down with red hot lead It will bo only a regrettable mistake But if I scratch her yellow skin It is a deathly , mortal sin They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , it ai nt right , and it ai nt fair Cause I ai nt got that skin and hair I wasnt born the way I ought to be . I 'm on the outside looking in So do nt expect to see me grin And laugh tho way that pretty women do . I have to scramble for a kiss When they get all this married bliss The men , the world , and Heaven too . So I feels mean , and I get sad I tries to laugh , but I ai nt glad . I often curse the day that I was born . I build some lovely dreams at night Then see them killed in broad daylight And all my tender feelings laughed to scorn . I sure cant help the way I 'm made And so , when all is done and said I 'm just a victim of relentless fate . I got big love , that I cant give . I got a life , still , I cant live . Just all damned up and turning into hate . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I want , too . I wouldnt like ' em , even if I could ! And women thwarted , just like me Thought up those fires in Hell , in gleo So come on , Evil ! Be thou now my good ! ( Takes her knife out of her pocket , feels the edge carefully , and begins to whet it grimly on the edge of the stove . Stops and tests it on her thumb , and whets again vigorously ) p. 138 DICEY LONG ( Sings briefly ) Get your razor cause I got mine Feel mistreated and I do nt mind dying --  --  ( There comos a swift , but stealthy , insistent knocking at the door . Dicey halts whetting abruptly , looks scared , but on guard , wonders whether to open door or not , but as the knocking begins again , she hears the voice of Nunkie frightened outside ) NUNKIE ( Offstage ) Dicey ! Dicey ! Let me in here ! DICEY LONG ( Relieved , hurries to door , turns key and opens it partly ) NUNKIE ( Bursting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there knocking for ? Somebody could have cut my throat . DICEY LONG I did nt know if it was you or not . Somebody could have seen me coming in . NUNKIE Oh , they do nt know --  --  DICEY LONG I bet they does , too . Lonnie , course I do nt expect no more out of him . Big Sweet must got him fixed . He believe what she say all the time . Its a hidden mystery how she got him so tied up . And that Quarters Boss , he ai nt nothing . Made out he was going to run Big Sweet off , but you see she here right on . NUNKIE ( Outdone and depressed ) Oh , you did nt tell him like I told you ! If you had of made it bad enough --  --  --  -- - p. 139 DICEY LONG ( Hotly ) Yes I did too ! I made it real distressing . But look like it do nt do no good at all , no matter what you say about her . NUNKIE ( Glum ) I sure hopes we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , She say they do nt last when she hold that kind of dance on ' em . ( Animated ) Lord , if it work like she say ! We dance on ' em and they all stand there in they tracks and cant move . Just like statutes ! ( Happy anticipation ) And whilst they standing there and cant move at all , we go in on ' em with our knives and ruin ' om ! I takes Big Sweet first one . DICEY LONG And I takes that Leafy Lee . My Honey too . I hates him now just as bad as I used to love him . All I want to do is to git them two good , then I 'm long gone , like a turkey thru the corn . NUNKIE We better be fast . Just in case , you know . Big Sweet might be able to move some , and if she do --  --  --  DICEY LONG Did nt Ella say they wont be able to move atall ? Just like they made out of wood till we git through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured ) Yeah , but Voodoo do nt take on some folks . Specially if they got this straight hair . It ai nt got nothing to tangle in . Us better dash in and do what we got to do , and light out . After mo and Ella gits Big Sweet hack all of ' em a lick or two and git for Mulberry. p. 140 Act 3 , Scene 2 SCENE : AN HOUR LATER , THE SAME NIGHT . A CLEARING DEEP IN THE WOODS . The clearing is small , and freshly cleared . Brush hurriedly cut away . Wall of tropical growth around . Big trees , hung with Spanish moss . Glistening leaves and trailing vines , and bright flowers . Lush , Up stage , center is a rude seat covered with a symbolic cloth like a throne . Before it is a short length of log for a footstool . The drums are against the shrubbery , right . In the center is a minature coffin with a circle of candles about it . At the rise , Ella Wall in full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked to the waist stand on either side of her with a gourd rattle , highly decorated in each hand . A red candle is fixed to Ella 's headress and is alight . There is a small white candle fixed to the back of each of her hands . All of the others wear lighted candles also . The dancers are ranged around the clearing in a circle . Two women downstage right and left have no candles on their hands . They have cymbals poised to play . The men with the rattles have their arms uplifted tensely , waiting for the downstroke . The drums are playing the introduction . All the dancers have their hands extended toward the throne . The right hand is drawn back stiffly , while the left is extended full length , palms down , with knees flexed . They hold this pose rigidly while the drums mount and Ella begins to make rhythmic motions as she sits . The gourd-rattles take up and the " ractling men " beating a counter time on the back of the drums take up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ELLA WALL ( Chanting ) Ah , minni wah oh ! Ah , minni wah oh ! p. 141 DANCERS ( Beginning to dance ) Say kay ah , brah aye ! ELLA WALL ( Dances to coffin , makes some liquid movement of her upper body ) Yokko tekko ! Yokko tekko ! Yahm pahn sah ay ! MEN Ah yah yee-ay ! Ah , yah yee-ay ! Ah say oh ! ELLA WALL ( A vigorous solo about the coffin . Comes to dramatic pause ) Yekko tekko ! Ah pah sah ay ! ( Up to now , the dance has been mostly movements of the upper body . Posture dancing . Now it mounts . Ella is dancing solo against the Congo of the group , who circle the coffin in a wide circle as they dance with hands stiff at the wrist , palms down . Ella begins to sing and they fall in behind her ) Hand a ' bowl , knife a'throat Rope a'tie me , hand a'bowl ( Drums and rattles have mounted to furious pitch ) Hand a'bowl knife a'throat Wang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doe-doe , fum dee ah ! ( The dance reaches a frenzy . Some leap over the coffin . Others do other steps . Ella dances furiously in the midst . Now their movements blend with hers . Now the others are mere background for her . At the climax , suddenly every candle is blown out and in the dim light , the dancers depart silently to the throb of the diminished drum tones . CURTAIN p. 142 Act 3 , Scene 3 SCENE : IMMEDIATELY AFTER SCENE 2 . WOODS PICNIC GROUNDS . This clearing differs from the other only in that it is larger and shows signs of long use . A rude table has been contrived by laying long boards on saw-horses . An old tree stump is downstage center . A few wooden boxes are scattered around the edges for seats . A quilt or two have been brought along to sit on . These too , are along the edges so that the main clearing is left for movement . Just beyond the clearing , upstage , left , a crude dressing booth has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with colored table cloths and towels are under the table . They have the refreshments in them . At the rise , Bunch , Laura B. and Maudella are fussing around the table unpacking baskets and setting out the pans and dishes of foods , and tasteing things here and there as they work . My Honey is seated on the stump , with Few Clothes squatting on the ground beside him . Both have their instruments and are playing . All the men are grouped around the musicians harmonizing GEORGIA BUCK . LONNIE ( Singing ) Oh , Georgia Buck is dead ! Last word he said I do nt want no shortening in my bread . CHORUS Is that you , Reuben ? Is that you , Reuben ? And they laid poor Reuben 's body down . p. 143 MY HONEY Oh , rabbit on the log , ai nt got no dog How am I going git him ? Lord knows ! CHORUS Is that you , Reuben ? Is that you , Reuben ? And they laid poor Reuben 's body down . STEW BEEF Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barlow knife And they laid poor Reuben 's body down . CHORUS Is that you , Reuben ? Is that you , Reuben ? And they laid poor Reuben 's body down . LAURA B. ( Admiringly ) Now , listen at Stew ! ( Beaming at his cleverness ) Thats the biggest fool ! STEW BEEF ( Acknowledging the compliment ) Being a fool never kilt nobody . All it do is make you sweat . LAURA B. ( Even prouder ) Did nt I tell you he was crazy ? STEW BEEF Did you cook that stew beef and bring it with you like I told you ? I 'm gitting peckish . ( Rubs his stomach ) LONNIE Me too . FEW CLOTHES ( Starting to get up hurriedly ) Lets eat ! p. 144 LONNIE Big Sweet and Leafy say you ai nt supposed to eat before a marriage . After the couple stands up is when you eats . STEW BEEF My Honey , go ahead and git your marrying done so we can eat . My biggest gut feel like it done dwindled down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the table ) LAURA B. Naw , Big Sweet said not to touch a thing till after the marriage . BUNCH ( Heaping up a pan of fried chicken ) These mens ! They sure favors they stomachs . If Judgment Day was to come , Few would expect me to fix him a bucket to carry along . LAURA B. Stew Beef is just the same . He ever love beef stew . Look like I cant never fill him up . Just like Eating-Flukus --  --  eat up camp meeting , back off of Association and drink Jordan dry . LONNIE Look like the thing to do is to git the marrying done . You ready , ai nt you , My Honey ? MY HONEY ( Nervous , but trying to be casual ) Just as ready as a meat axe . SOP-THE-BOTTOM Turn round here lets see how you look in your new suit . ( They all scatter back in a rough circle , around My Honey and look him over from head to foot ) You looks fine , man . Any gal ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 145 STEW BEEF That suit is ready . Believe I 'll git me one like that . Laura B. , you want me in a double-breaster like My Honey got on when we jump over the broomstick ? LAURA B. ( Bridling ) Yeah . You would look good in it , all right . LONNIE Course My Honey look good . I picked out that suit for him to stand up in . ( Looks to table ) Maudella , run back there and see if Big Sweet done got Leafy dressed . MAUDELLA ( Hurrying towards booth ) Yessir . LAURA B. Oh , do nt worry the gal . It takes time for dressing for gitting married . LONNIE You women and your dressing ! ( Sighs ) But I reckon us men just have to put up with you . We cant git along without you . But you sure got funny ways . ( The women protest this but the men laugh in agreement ) STEW BEEF Lonnie , you acts slow and everything , but you sure knows a heap . Always saying something deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a veil . Big Sweet is holding the veil up from the grass with one hand . Maudella is walking behind and admiring Leafy with open mouth wonder . Leafy advances slowly with a nervous smile and downcast eyes . All the men gaze at her with awe and admiration ) p. 146 MY HONEY ( Stares in awe , then takes a step or two towards her and stops as if approaching an altar ) BOX CAR ( More brazen , walks nearer and stands and admires ) Lord ! I could lick icing off of that all day long . LONNIE Leafy , you looks like a glance from God . MY HONEY ( Advances slowly as Big Sweet looks at her handiwork and beams ) Baby , ( Swallows hard ) baby , you looks too good to walk on the ground . LEAFY LEE Much obliged for your compliments . ( They start to hold hands ) LONNIE ( Looking around ) Now , where is that preacher ? He was here just a while ago . SOP-THE-BOTTOM ( Indicates the woods ) Oh , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BIG-SWEET ( Fussing with the wreath ) Hold on a minute . I needs another hairpin right here . ( Turns to hurry off ) Be back in just a second . Want to catch that up a little more . ( She darts off and disappears into the booth ) p. 147 MY HONEY ( Takes Leafy 's hand and they stand there smiling and swinging hands without speaking ) DO-DIRTY This marrying business is nice . Us could have been having fun like this all the time , but we did nt have no sense . If Big Sweet and Lonnie had nt of told us , we wouldnt know . STEW BEEF Thats a fact . You just wait till next month when me and Laura B. stand up . We going to have  - -  -  FEW CLOTHES Man , but me and Bunch is going to really break it up . She 's going to have a dress like that and I 'm going to be togged down in a suit and white shoes and everything . Lonnie , you sure done started something . PREACHER ( Enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild and popping . He stumbles to center stage with his mouth working , but no words come out . They look at him for a moment in astonishment . But Maudella cries out and points upstage left as Dicey leaps out into the clearing with her knife drawn . Her entrance is like the spring of a lioness . She is only a few yards off and behind My Honey and Leafy who are looking at each other ) DICEY LONG ( After her initial spring , stops dramatically , with her knife in hand and takes in the situation gloating . She has all the manner of a lioness ready to charge ) Well , I told you I would be back , did nt I ? p. 148 MY HONEY ( Whirls , leaps in front of Leafy instinctively and holds his guitar like a shield ) ( The group is struck dumb for an instant . Everyone is frozen in their tracks ) LEAFY LEE ( Gives a little cry of helplessness ) DICEY LONG ( Laughs , wringing herself from her hips ) You cant do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to cut you all in your face . ( Venomously as she crouches ) Slice you too thin to fry . DICEY LONG ( Gestures to the woods behind her ) I got plenty help to do it with . ( She advances slowly , knife poisod and laughing . Suddenly , Ella and Nunkio run on to the edge of the clearing behind Dicey ) BIG-SWEET ( Enters hurriodly . Is brought up short by the tableau and gots set to spring , at the same time yelling ) " Lonnie ! Stew ! " ( Her cry and movement bring everybody alive , and they rush to the charge . It also affects Dicey profoundly and she leaps back in fright ) DICEY LONG ( Backing up in betrayed horror of her situation ) They ai nt sleep ! They can move ! ( It is a bitter accusation of Ella who is also retroating ) p. 149 ELLA WALL ( Dazed and terrified by the danger , and astonished by the failure of her magic leaps back and looks at the onrush in unbelief ) Make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn and flee pell mell through the woods . The men start to pursue , but Lonnie halts them ) LONNIE Stop ! Box ! Stew ! My Honey ! All you all ! Stop ! BOX CAR ( Unwilling ) They will make they git-away ! LONNIE Naw , they wont . Listen to me , now . MY HONEY We got to make it so they cant come back , Lonnio ( There is a shot off stage , right , and a loud voice cries " Halt ! " Another shot . " I said Halt !

Her mama 's womb just played a dirty trick on her when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but lightly ) PREACHER ( Mopping his faco from fright , but getting control ) I seen them folks a'coming while I was out there . p. 151 LONNIE I could tell you had seen something , but I couldnt know what . You ready to go to work ? PREACHER ( Assuming his official manner ) If the bride and groom will take floor . ( He advances toward them pompously as Big Sweet arranges the couple center but a little upstage ) LONNIE This is more like my dream . ( Musing ) Things is going to be better now . Folks everywhere will look upon us more . Us can make things more better all around . ( Unconsciously begins to hum , and the others drift in ) Troubles will be over , Amen Troubles will be over , Amen Troubles will be over , when I see Jesus Troubles will be over , Amen PREACHER ( Takes his stand before My Honey and Leafy , opens his book dramatically , and begins to perform the ceremony in pantomime . The singing goes on and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements of lips ) LONNIE I see the light-house , Amen I see the light-house , Amen I see the light-house , when I see Jesus Troubles will be over , Amen .

Like gamblers going to Heaven . Its plenty for everybody . LONNIE ( Stepping back from the table with his plato ) Ummmmm ! This is nico ! Chicken purleau ! ( Strolls over to the stump with his plato and sits down and cats a few mouthfuls . As the others get their plates they scatter from the table and sit about laughing and talking happily ) ( My Honey and Leafy go sit on a a quilt with their plates and she feeds him with her fork ) p. 153 MY HONEY This is love , Baby , with the sun and the moon thrown in .

( Pets Big Sweet on the ground beside him ) Now , I can fly . Everything is going to be just fine . ( There comes the sound of the mystic drums . They all listen . Lonnie smiles in his peculiar way as the drums grow in volumo . They smile , they laugh , then begin to sway to the drums ) LONNIE I ride the rainbow , Amen I ride the rainbow , Amen LONNIE ( A huge rainbow descends . They all scramble on board , plates in hand , and take seats . Lonnie in the very center with Big Sweet on one side My Honey and Leafy on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I see Jesus Troubles will be over , Amen . ( The rainbow begins to rise as the verse is repoated . The rainbow rises slowly and the curtain begins to descend at the same time slowly ) FINAL CURTAIN
