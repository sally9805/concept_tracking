Every honest newspaper man in Washington last week knew the existence of a semi-organized campaign to spread lies about the British , particularly about alleged British misuse of Lend-Lease funds . For two weeks one such story made the rounds of irresponsible gossips : that the British in Washington were running up huge caf and restaurant bills for rare wines , whiskey , food , were charging it all to Lend-Lease funds . The British were further supposed to have ordered the installation of 100 portable air-conditioning units in their hotel rooms ; to have chatted for hours with Canadian friends by long-distance telephone-in all cases charging the bill to Lend-Lease . <P> Last week the story suddenly appeared in the Washington Times-Herald , which reprints correspondence from the Chicago Tribune . Under the byline of New Deal-hating Correspondent Walter Trohan was the story , ascribed only to " reliable Congressional circles , " and headlined : " British Here Make Whoopee As U.S. Pays-$30,000 in Wine , Food Reported Charged To Lend-Lease Bill . " The story had a fancy new touch : Trohan wrote that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 'll Always Be An England ) which ran : " There 'll always be a dollar , as long as we are here . " " Charge it to Lend-Lease " , wrote Mr. Trohan , " is a byword at British headquarters . " <P> The biggest single fact on which all these stories was based was obviously untrue : no cash changes hands in Lend-Lease transaction . The British can not possibly charge such items , as Lend-Lease procedure is guided as much by what the U.S. needs as by what England needs , is concerned primarily with guns , tanks , planes , more &; more with the direct shipment of foodstuffs . <P> But the fact that such a story could be printed revealed how little the average U.S. citizen understood such a complex procedure . The story was easy to understand ; and some isolationists even professed a grudging admiration for British sharpness-making it seem all the truer . <P> A follow-up story came out in the New York Daily News . Not to be outdone , Correspondents John O'Donnell and Doris Fleeson printed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its principal-Federal Loan Administrator Jesse H. Jones . Lender Jones was reported present at a discussion of an alleged British Lend-Lease requisition for glasses of all kinds-sherry , port , brandy glasses . The order supposedly ended with a request for several drums of rum . Doubtless not bearing in mind Dunkirk , Libya , Crete and the R.A.F. every night over the Channel , Jones is supposed to have instantly suggested : " Give them the rum . Maybe they 'll fight . " <P> Enough was enough . The President at his next press conference took cognizance of the rumors . When Newshawk O'Donnell asked a question , the President snapped his head off with a brusque answer . Then Mr. Roosevelt turned to other stories about the misuse of Lend-Lease funds , labelled them as examples of the vicious rumors , distortion of facts , or just plain , dirty falsehoods , which he said were being circulated in an organized campaign to sabotage the program to defeat Hitlerism . The condemnation was one of the bitterest he had ever made-and one of the truest.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
