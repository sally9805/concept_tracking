txt WASHINGTON , July 2 ? Charges that the Federal Communications Commission , under the chairmanship of James Lawrence Fly , had abused its statutory powers to the detriment of the peacetime civil interests of the people and of the war effort were made at the opening hearing today of the committee appointed last January by the House of Representatives to investigate the agency . The committee , headed by Representative Edward E. Cox of Georgia , was ordered by the House to determine whether the commission in fact " has been and is acting // ABUSE OF POWERS IS CHARGED TO FCC // in accordance with law and the public interest . " Based on evidence collected by the committee 's investigating staff and supporting documents read at the hearing , more than fifty specific charges ranging from incompetence to invasion of the field of radio military intelligence over the protest of the War and Navy Departments were presented by Eugene L. Garey , general committee counsel . " It the commission has sought to cloak itself as an essential war agency making a vital contribution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities constitute a danger and menace to national security , " Mr. Garey told the committee . Letter to President Is Read In support of the statement , he offered in evidence a joint letter from the Secretaries of War and Navy to President Roosevelt requesting , on the recommendation of the United States Chiefs of Staff , the promulgation of an Executive order transferring to the War and Navy Departments " all functions , powers and duties of the FCC in the field of radio intelligence . " " Because of the essential differences between military and FCC standards and methods , it has not been possible to integrate their information , with the result that the attempted duplication by the FCC of work that is being more effectively done by the military has in fact endangered the effectiveness and security of military radio intelligence , " Admiral William D. Leahy , on behalf of the joint Chiefs of Staff , wrote to the Secretary of the Navy on Feb. 1 . Admiral Leahy 's recommendation was based on the findings of a study made in response to a memorandum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy to the Joint Chiefs of Staff , whose conclusions he summarized . On Feb. 8 his letter and the proposed executive order were forwarded to the President with the letter signed jointly by the Secretaries of War and Navy . " The executive order sought has not yet been signed , " Mr. Garey said . " The matter of the Army and Navy controversy with the 1FCC went to the White House on Feb .. 8 , and there it has remained . " On June 25 , Mr. Garey continued , letters were written by him to the Secretaries of War and Navy , both of which he put in evidence , requesting on behalf of the committee the presence at the coming hearings of named officers as witnesses and the production of documents and papers from the files of their departments . " To neither of these letters have I had a reply , " Mr. Garey said . " I have been informed that the departments will gather and forward the data , as requested , but that the officers will not be permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been silenced and gagged by higher authority . I prefer to believe that this is untrue . " In the meantime , and pending the disposition of this and other matters , he suggested adjournment of the hearing until next Friday . Objection was entered by Representative Warren A. Magnuson of Washington against the drawing of " conclusions " by the counsel for the committee which he said should be arrived at , if at all , by the committee itself . He was reminded both by Representative Cox and Mr. Garey that not only had no conclusions been drawn by the latter , but that the counsel for the committee had stated his refusal to entertain a conclusion that the desired witnesses would be forbidden to appear . " However , " Representative Cox said , " I will make the statement on my own responsibility , that consent has not been given for the officers to appear . " The hearing was twice interrupted by Charles R. Denny Jr. , general counsel for the FCC , who sought first to question Mr. Garey about the letters of Admiral Leahy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and later tried vainly to address the committee . He was ruled out of order and finally threatened with ejection by the chairman . A statement was issued for Mr. Fly , denying on his own behalf and that of the commission all the charges entered at today 's hearing .
