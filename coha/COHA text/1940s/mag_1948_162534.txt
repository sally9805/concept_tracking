Alabama 's huge ( 6 ft. 8 in. , 260 Ibs. ) , boar-browed Governor James ( " Kissin ' Jim " ) Folsom was feeling fine when he set out on a drive to Washington last week . He hoped to testify before a congressional committee on tidelands oil . He planned to go to New York to see some fashion models who had voted him No . I Leap Year Bachelor , and thus get his picture in the papers . As a self-avowed presidential candidate , he also hoped to rebroadcast a campaign promise-that he would take his " ole cornshuck mop and his ole suds bucket " and sweep up the Democratic Party . <P> But when he got to Washington he discovered that a Mrs. Christine Putnam Johnston , of Hanceville , Ala. ( pop . 650 ) had beaned him with a legal dornick . Christine , a tall , redheaded divorcee , had asked the Cullman County circuit court to declare Big Jim her common-law husband and the father of her 22-month-old son . She had also told reporters a tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life , she said , in 1944 when she was 26 . She was a Baptist farmer 's daughter who had been married , divorced , and had a job as cashier of a Birmingham hotel . Big Jim was 36 , a widower with two small daughters . He had been around the world as a merchant seaman , had gone briefly to college , had served a short wartime hitch in the Army . When he met Christine he was a salesman for a burial-insurance company . <P> He immediately bought her a big charcoal-broiled steak . There was a wild , backwoods look about him . He seldom wore socks and liked to take his shoes off when he ate ; he enjoyed wiggling his enormous toes and grinding ice cubes between his gargantuan molars . As time wore on , he sometimes borrowed money from her . But she loved him madly anyhow . She swore they had lived as husband and wife . <P> She had her baby ( 11 Ibs. ) in Nashville , recorded his name as James Douglas Johnston , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the child from press publicity . " She did not complain-Big Jim was running for governor and had promised to make her the " first lady of Alabama " afterwards . She did n't even object to his campaign methods : he traveled to the " crossroads , the branch-heads and the brush arbors " with a hillbilly band , called on it to strike up a tune called " Pucker up , Honey , Jim Folsom 's Comin ' , " and then galumphed through crowds kissing all the women . <P> But after he got elected , Christine began to have doubts . For one thing , Big Jim began wearing socks and a pin-striped suit and took to riding around in a Cadillac sedan . For another thing , he did n't send for her . Finally-to the dismay of her father 's neighbors , who wanted Big Jim to build them a " black top " ( paved ) road-she decided to sue him . <P> In Washington , Big Jim seemed staggered , though not overcome , by the news . While registering at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " My , but you 're mighty pretty , miss , " but did not attempt to kiss her . He blamed the paternity suit on " politics . " Next day , he got into his car and vanished . <P> But Alabamans knew that a coon as big as Kissin ' Jim could n't stay holed up forever . What would happen next ? As they waited for him to burst out of the brush , nobody seemed to know whether the voters would boo , cheer , or just gawk as though they had seen a pink giraffe.
