Who won the Wallace-Jones fight ( TIME , July 12 , et seq . ) ? Foxy old Cordell Hull . <P> A Washington saying of the past decade is that the city is littered with the bones of men who have opposed Cordell Hull ; that the old Tennessean feuder works quietly and cautiously but he always gets his man . That man is anyone who tries to run any part of foreign policy while the State Department is still around . Ranked by protocol as No. 1 Cabinet officer , the Secretary of State normally bosses all U.S. dealings with foreign governments . His corps of deft protocol artists has never allowed a mere war agency to forget it . <P> Those who have had business abroad ( Herbert Lehman 's OFRR , Nelson Rockefeller 's OCIAA , Elmer Davis ' OWI ) have slowly , painfully learned that all foreign business must funnel through the State Department . The hard-to-handle exception was Henry Wallace 's Board of Economic Warfare . When BEW was scrapped by Executive Order , Secretary Hull promptly stepped up and claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mobilization 's James F. Byrnes he penned a firm letter . Would OWM Czar Byrnes kindly make it clear , in writing , to all agencies concerned , that : <P> &gt; Henceforward , OWM will use State Department facilities to " unify " all U.S. work touching on foreign supply , procurement , any other foreign economic matter . <P> &gt; All agencies must describe their foreign plans in advance to the State Department , must get approval before going ahead . <P> &gt; All actual dealings with foreign govern ments ( at home or abroad ) will be handled by the State Department . <P> &gt;Officials hired by any Government agency to work outside the U.S. must be checked and approved by State . <P> &gt;When non-State U.S. officials abroad want to get in touch with their Washington offices , State will handle the communications . <P> &gt; State will appoint " in each significant center of operation ... a Director of Economic Operations " ( responsible to Secretary Hull after the military moves out ) . <P> &gt; State Department will sit on the board of directors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reserve Corp . <P> " In order to avoid current confusion , " Cordell Hull hoped politely that Czar Byrnes would issue these instructions to all agencies concerned " at the earliest possible moment .
