The angriest rebuke for any nation not at war with the U.S. was hurled by Secretary of State Cordell Hull at Argentina last week ( see U.S. AT WAR ) . <P> The State Department , giving a " summary of the position of the U.S. Government , " declared that : Argentina had " deliberately violated the pledge " it took at the 1942 Rio de Janeiro Conference to cooperate with the rest of the hemisphere against the Axis . It had " openly and notoriously " given " aid and comfort " to the enemies of the United Nations for two and a half years . The dominant power in its government " was , and continues to be , in the hands of pro-Axis elements . " Therefore , the U.S. concluded that the American Republics and their United Nations associates should " firmly adhere to the present policy of nonrecognition of the President Edelmiro Farrell regime " until Argentina demonstrated a change in its policy " by unequivocal acts . " <P> In Buenos Aires , extreme nationalist organizations seized the golden opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pro-Nazi newspapers , El Federal , Cabildo , La Fronda screamed the same note . Foreign Minister Orlando Peluffo , in the first speech he had made in his three months in office , nicely balanced a protest of good-neighborly intentions with a proud declaration of independence . Many an Argentine who had looked on the military regime with a fishy eye was now moved to support it as defender of his country 's sovereignty . <P> <P> Had any of Secretary Hull 's shots hit the target ? Near the center of it was Juan Domingo Pern , Vice President , Minister of War , Secretary of Labor and Welfare , master of President Farrell and dominant figure in the military government . Pern has apparently swung from extreme to moderate nationalism . That is , as a devout Argentine-firster , he no longer considers either hatred of the Yanquis or bundling with the Axis indispensable to his career . Hull 's blast inferentially called for a governmental house cleaning of all pro-Axis personalities , a national house cleaning of all German business enterprises . Pern threw some Axiphiles out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Argentines ' jealous love of their sovereignty forbade Pern last week to yield farther in this direction . But he did something more popular , cleverer , more likely to produce better feeling between Argentina and the anti-Axis world . He loosened the bonds of the Argentine press . <P> Newspaper Renaissance . Pro-democratic Argentine newspapers had been lock-jawed Charley McCarthys . Now , the Government announced , they were free to publish what they pleased . La Prensa , La Nation and other anti-Axis papers promptly printed the full text of Secretary Hull 's angry statement , or made thorough summaries of it . They followed this up by - publishing columns of sharp editorial comment from London , Washington , New York and various Latin American capitals . <P>
