The R.A.F. may soon be eating Arizona carrots in preference to all other carrots on earth . The British Ministry of Foods last week impatiently cabled to University of Arizona Nutrition Chemist Margaret Cammack Smith for more details on her discovery that " Arizona carrots contain three to ten times as much carotene as the average carrot*-a discovery , said the Ministry , " of extreme interest and value . " <P> Reason : carotene , a yellow pigment occurring in association with chlorophyll in green plants , is transformed by the body ( probably the liver ) into vitamin A , which insures sharp human vision at night . <P> Unlike some vitamins , vitamin A can not be easily synthesized ; and fish livers , from which the vitamin is extracted , have been scarce since war broke out in 1939 . So Arizona 's three to four thousand acres of carrots ( whose harvesting began last fortnight ) may be the answer to every aviation command 's problem of preventing night blindness in its flyers , who tend to subsist largely on peanuts and candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find whether Arizona 's winter growing season , soil or sunshine is responsible .
