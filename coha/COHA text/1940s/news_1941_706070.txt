txt A TEST FOR TOKYO President Asks Straight Reply on Pouring of Men Into Colony BARS ' POLICING ' ANSWER Question Is Held Designed to Settle Sincerity of Tokyo in Washington Talks By FRANK L. KLUCKIIOIIN Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES . WASHINGTON , Dec. 2 ? President Roosevelt announced that he formally asked the Japanese Government today why it was sending so many military , naval and air forces into Indo-China  --  jumpingoff place for an attack on Thailand and the Burma Road  --  and expressed hope for a very quick reply . The President insisted that his request did not represent an ultimatum . Diplomatic circles expressed the opinion , however , that his urgent inquiry placed Japan in a position where she must withdraw forces recently sent to and in transit to Indo-China and continue negotiations in Washington for permanent peace in the Pacific or face a breakdown of these negotiations and possible war against American , British , Netherland and Chinese forces in the Far East . Nevertheless , in the press conference where he revealed and explained his action , the Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States was at peace and indicated that he hoped for peaceful solution of Pacific difficulties . The Japanese representatives in Washington , Saburo Kurusu , special envoy , and Ambassador Kichisaburo Nomura , reflected the same state of mind . Bars ' Police ' Explanation Mr. Roosevelt said that his inquiry to Japan , delivered to the two Japanese representatives this morning by Sumner Welles , UnderSecretary of State , had barred a Japanese explanation that increased forces had been sent to Indo-China for police purposes . He remarked that Indo-China was a very peaceful spot . The President explained further that information had reached this government from many sources to the effect that additional Japanese forces of all kinds  --  military , naval and air  --  recently sent to French Indo-China exceeded those agreed to in June by the Vichy Government , which was forced to admit them under duress . He added that further Japanese forces on the way to Indo-China were many times greater than those already there . Before disclosing his action President Roosevelt conferred at the White House with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welles acted for Secretary of State Cordell Hull , who was indisposed today and did not visit the State Department . Neither . Mr. Stimson nor Mr. Knox would discuss the meeting . Another Reply Awaited Mr. Welles said earlier in a press conference that he assumed Japan would reply promptly to Secretary Hull 's communication of last Wednesday , setting forth the basic attitude of the United States . This was understood to have been prompted by earlier reports that Japanese forces were being rushed into Indo-China . Admiral Nomura said that " Mr. Welles talked and we listened . " Asked about the inquiry , which , a reporter remarked , a State Department spokesmen said President Roosevelt had made to Japan today , the President replied as follows : Since April the United States Government has been discussing with . the Japanese Government some method of arriving at the objective of permanent peace in the whole Pacific area . It seemed for a time as if progress were being made , and , during the period until late June , this government assumed that there would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Government was , therefore , somewhat surprised when , at the end of June , the Japanese Government sent troops ? the President thought a limited number  --  into French Indo-China after brief negotiations with the French Vichy Government . At the conclusion of these negotiations the Vichy Government let it be understood rather clearly it had agreed because it was powerless to do otherwise . Some time thereafter JapaneseAmerican conversations were resumed , and for a time seemed to make progress . Again it was understood clearly no additional territory should be taken by any one during the negotiations . The other day this government got word from various sources that there already were in IndoChina large additional Japanese forces  --  naval , air and land  --  and that other forces were on the way . Even without the arrival of forces in transit , Japanese strength greatly exceeded the original limitation agreed to by the French , and forces on the way are many times greater . The question , therefore , has been asked of the Japanese Government , at the President 's request , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eliminating the possibility that the forces might be for the policing of Indo-China , which is a very peaceful spot The President hopes to get a reply very shortly . " Was any time limit set for the reply ? " a reporter asked . " Time Limit " Outmoded That was a silly question , Mr. Roosevelt answered in replying in the negative . Those tactics were employed in the last century , but not in this . The United States is at peace with Japan and perfectly friendly , too , he added . Responsible officials privately persisted in their gloom over the Far Eastern situation and some felt that war involving the United I States was just around the corner . Authoritative sources said , nevertheless , that when Secretary Hull made his communication to Japan last week along lines similar to the President 's today , this government already had information of Japanese military and naval movements and that a drive into Thailand was expected by Monday . In some diplomatic quarters the fact that this drive had not yet taken place was regarded as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the brink of what to many seemed certain war against a strong combination of powers . After his talk with Under-Secretary Welles today , Ambassador Nomura declared : " War would not settle anything . It is natural to say that it is a question of war or peace , but war would not help and there is no reason why we should not settle these issues by diplomacy . " Both he and Mr. Kurusu insisted that the Japanese Government was giving careful consideration to all aspects of the Far Eastern situation before answering Secretary Hull 's statement of last Wednesday . Both expressed the opinion that a reply was being shaped in Tokyo with extreme deliberation . They talked to reporters before the President made his announcement . When he arrived in Washington Nov. 15 , Mr. Kurusu expressed the thought that the negotiations he was about to . undertake had a " fighting chance . " Questioned today by reporters as to whether he still thought so , he answered , " I do n't give up that easily . " Both Japanese envoys added to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been misquoted on his alleged statement that American and British influence should be " purged " from the Orient . They had said that a Japanese under-official had mistranslated the Premier 's . statement . They said today that this should have been translated to read that " the practice of European powers of checking one Oriental power against another " must be eliminated . They added that the speech was prepared for General Tojo and delivered by proxy in his name . Secretary Knox has emphasized that the Japanese Navy has more knowledge of the outside world than Japan 's Army and , therefore , is less inclined toward combat . Diplomats here pointed out today that Japanese diplomats were even better aware of the threat to Japan . The real danger , it is believed here , is that the more or less insular Japanese Army officers and particularly those colonels who have tremendous influence in the Army will precipitate events through their sublime ? if perhaps uninformed  --  confidence .                  @ @ @
