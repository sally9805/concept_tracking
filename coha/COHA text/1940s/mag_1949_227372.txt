When film production lags , most cine-moguls chew their fingernails . But while Producer David O. Selznick is killing time , he makes a tidy profit with a sideline which Hollywood calls flesh-peddling . Unlike an actors ' agent , whose commission is fixed at 10% , Selznick gets fat loan-out fees for the stars who are under contract to him as a producer . Because he is Hollywood 's shrewdest publicizer of talent , his stars are in great demand . His profit is the fees , minus the salaries he would be paying the players anyhow . <P> Last week Producer Selznick announced the closing of his biggest loan-out deal-probably the biggest of its kind in movie history . For a price that ran " well into seven figures " ( $1,500,000 was a likely guess ) , seven Selznick stars will go to Warner Bros , for a total of eleven or twelve pictures : Jennifer Jones ( whom D.O.S . is expected to marry this year ) , Gregory Peck , Joseph Gotten , Louis Jourdan , Shirley Temple , Rory Calhoun and Betsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was big ; Selznick 's studio and releasing organization were at a standstill . He was planning a European junket to get his fingers into a couple of British film productions . Insiders said that he was just waiting until his heavy investment came rolling back from his latest , long-delayed production , Portrait of Jennie . Meanwhile , though he lacks the kind of ready cash that he needs to make his kind of picture ( Gone With the Wind , Duel in the Sun ) , he would have some pocket money .
