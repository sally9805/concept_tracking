U.S. business asked the Government last week to tax it almost-but not quite-out of business . Through the National Association of Manufacturers it urged that " all income over and above that needed to keep our business structure alive should be taxed to the limit-leaving only enough for survival . " <P> Actually the $7,600,000,000 tax program submitted by the Association was not as near-suicidal as N.A.M . let on . The program proposed taking an added $1,500,000,000 out of corporate profits-but this was only half the $3,000,000,000 the Treasury had already asked . To make up for this change ( and others ) , the Association asked a $4,400,000,000 sales tax-which did not sound as altruistic as higher corporation taxes , but might cost business about as much in higher costs and lower public purchasing power . <P> Whether or not N.A.M . ' s tax program really called for taking away from business every last dollar that can be extracted , its announcement gave business the distinction of being one group that endorsed , in principle , the idea of taxing itself heavily . <P> Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in , business has feared inflation like a snake , and repeatedly offered to bear more taxes to " balance the budget . " These offers have been manna from heaven for the Government spenders . The balanced budget for which business volunteered to pay is further away than ever , but in the meantime corporation taxes ( excluding excess profits taxes ) have been boosted seven times , from 13% in 1933 to 31% in 1942.
