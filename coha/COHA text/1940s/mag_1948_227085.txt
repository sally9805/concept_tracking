One day last September , in California 's Central Valley , Candidate Harry Truman made his political advisers wince with an off-the-cuff attack on hard-shelled Republican Congressman Bertrand W. Gearhart . Said Harry Truman : " You have got a terrible Congressman here . He has done everything he possibly could do to cut the throats of the farmer and the laboring man . " Some of his aides , remembering the lesson of F.D.R. 's purge , argued that personal attacks often boomeranged in favor of the target . But wherever he went , Harry Truman never ceased to " pour it on " Republican members of the 80th Congress . <P> When the count of the new House of Representatives was completed last week , seven-termer Bertrand Gearhart was at the bottom of the wreckage of 75 Republican seats . He was soundly beaten by a man who had never before run for public office : tall , 47-year-old Cecil White , a cotton rancher who campaigned by radio and in his small airplane . <P> Not every one of the new Democratic Representatives in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Cecil White . But most of them did owe their election to the issues which the President raised in his attacks on the 80th Congress . A few unknowns , who thought they had no chance to win , were swept in . Some , who did not subscribe to all of Harry Truman 's campaign promises , were elected because of local issues . But a composite of the new congressional faces showed a political complexion much like Harry Truman 's . Representative faces : <P> HUGH B. MITCHELL , 41 , had served two years in the U.S. Senate as an appointee and protege of Washington 's defeated Governor Mon Wallgren , but was beaten in the Republican sweep of 1946 . A scholarly ex-newsman , his legislative passion is extension of public power projects . <P> FRED MARSHALL , 42 , a lean , hard-muscled farmer , uprooted Minnesota 's stubborn Harold Knutson , chairman of the Ways &; Means Committee , whose 32 years in Congress had lulled him into thinking he could never be beaten . Marshall , who had been Minnesota 's Farm Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , argued that Knutson 's 1948 tax-cut bill was " a rebate to the rich . " <P> ROBERT L. COFFEY JR. , 30 , is a onetime coal miner . He resigned his Air Force lieutenant-colonelcy and his post as air attache at the U.S. Embassy in Chile to run for office in a traditionally Republican district of western Pennsylvania . With little money or organization , but with labor 's help in ringing doorbells , curly-haired Bob Coffey , a veteran of 97 fighter combat flights in Europe , strafed five-term Congressman Harve Tibbott 's isolationist record . Coffey is one of eleven new Democratic Congressmen from Pennsylvania ; President Truman had campaigned in all but one of their districts . <P> M. G. BURNSIDE , 49 , is a professor of political science at Marshall College in Huntington , W.Va. , who failed to win in 1946 . This time , with coal miners out in full cry to show John L. Lewis that he could not tell them how to vote , Burnside and three other Democrats toppled Republican incumbents.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
