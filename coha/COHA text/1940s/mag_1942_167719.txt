" I beg you to believe me that this opposition of mine is no mere political dispute ; it is a deep conflict of principle . I hold that no man should ascend to the bench to pass upon the rights , even the lives , of other men when he is obligated to a political boss ... Still worse , it seems to me , would be a judge long associated with and long beholden to a man who says that and acts as if the law begins and ends with himself . " So wrote Governor Edison of New Jersey . <P> To get re-elected next fall , New Jersey 's ruddy , sleek Senator William H. Smathers must have the help of Boss Frank Hague . So Smathers recently backed Hague 's man Thomas F. Meaney for a Federal judgeship . And , although Senator Smathers has not distinguished himself in the Senate , President Roosevelt , who wants 100% New Dealers reelected , obligingly appointed Meaney ( TIME , May 18 ) . The deal was a piece of routine politics . <P> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no routine politician . Independently wealthy as head of his father 's " Edison Industries , " he went into public life to earn his pay , not just to get it . He was made Assistant Secretary of the Navy by his great &; good friend Franklin Roosevelt , later ran for Governor in 1940 as a personal favor to the President . As Governor , he has waged a bitter , housecleaning battle to purify New Jersey politics by sweeping out the ubiquitous Hague cockroaches . <P> Governor Edison knew that President Roosevelt 's appointment of Meaney was the routine sort of kick-in-the-face that practical politicians must learn to shrug off . He knew that , unless he held his peace , he would embarrass Friend Roosevelt . Yet last week , with the philosophic detachment of the deaf , and the practical detachment of a man to whom politics is more than a game , he sat down and wrote a statesman 's letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee . <P> " From the day when his name was first mentioned , I have opposed the appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antipathy to Meaney-so far as I know I have never met him-but because he represents an attitude toward the judicial office which is to me repulsive , and is and ever will be , I hope , repulsive to all Americans . . . . <P> " The recent career of Mr. Meaney has demonstrated that he is a pawn in the hands of a man who has expressed his conception of the nature of justice in the now-famous phrase , ' I am the law . ' . . . Can it be assumed that he will divest himself of the habits of a lifetime and administer his court with a justice unstained by politics ? " <P> Statesman Edison put the issue of making Tom Meaney a judge up to the statesmen of the U.S. Senate .
