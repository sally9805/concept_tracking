In the days when Franklin Roosevelt first flashed his magic smile in the White House , newsmen adored him because he was accessible , usually answered their questions . Nowadays Franklin Roosevelt lets White House Secretary Stephen Early arrange his audiences-but Steve Early , a onetime Associated Pressman himself , sometimes gets in wrong with the press . <P> One morning last week Steve rode into Washington with the President on a special train from Hyde Park , sent word to the six photographers on duty at the White House that Mr. Roosevelt would pose for a newspicture while he swore in Frank Comerford Walker , successor to Jim Farley as Postmaster General . Steve , who loathes train rides , was in no mood to be tactful . He gave orders that one photographer was to be admitted , no more . That one must share his picture with the other five . <P> Presently , in the President 's oval study a Bible was laid out on the desk , the principals sat waiting . An imperious call was relayed to the " doghouse , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another and another . Nothing happened . The photographers were on strike against Steve Early . <P> It was a flare-up of a long-maturing feud . ( Fortnight ago , for example , Early tried to exclude all cameramen while Jim Farley paid his last call on the President . ) If there had been a crowd in the White House study last week , said the photographers , they would have taken Early 's orders meekly . But no one was there except the President , his new Postmaster , and Associate Justice Stanley Forman Reed , who was to do the swearing . If all six could have snapped pictures each would have had his picture in a few minutes , but if one took a picture and distributed copies to the others they would have to wait for several hours . They sent word to Steve Early : " All or none . " <P> No sooner had old A. P. Man Early heard the cameramen 's ultimatum than he picked up a phone , called William Beale , acting chief of A. P. 's Washington bureau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the President 's dignity . " A. P. 's Beale spoke to A. P. Photo 's Robert Walton , who promptly called his own boss in Manhattan . Then in the doghouse , good-natured , unassuming little A. P. Photographer Charles Gorry got a call from Steve Early . Said Steve : " Your boss says to take that picture or else . ... " <P> Thunderstruck Charles Gorry was ushered into the President 's study . The ceremony was snapped . Then Franklin Roosevelt jovially remarked that since Gorry was the only cameraman in Washington willing to take the picture , maybe he ought to be Postmaster General . Said pert Photographer Gorry : " For $5,000 it 's O.K. with me . " <P> The President chuckled , forthwith pulled a gag . While Steve Early manned the camera , Gorry took Postmaster Walker 's place , was snapped receiving his " commission " from the President ( see cut ) . Then back to the doghouse trotted Charles Gorry , elated . To his colleagues went copies of the official picture , but the gag shot was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
