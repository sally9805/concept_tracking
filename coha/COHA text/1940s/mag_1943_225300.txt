In an atmosphere redolent of honest sweat 180 palm-powdered athletes , clothed in bathing trunks , tennis flannels , track shorts and acrobats ' tights , flipped around the gymnasium of Manhattan 's West Side Y.M.C.A. like desperate fish . They were top-rung U.S. gymnasts competing in one of the oldest and least publicized of national tournaments : the 58th annual amateur U.S. gymnastic championships . <P> Modern apparatus gymnastics was founded in the early 19th Century by Germany 's Friedrich Ludwig Jahn . To this day the world 's gymnasts follow the etiquette as well as the exercises established on his Turnplatz . They approach their specialties with exaggerated posturings and goose-step tread , perform with Teutonic precision . Besides the apparatus events ( horizontal bar , parallel bars , side horse , long horse , flying rings and balance beam ) , championship tournaments include rope-climbing , Indian clubs , calisthenics , tumbling . <P> Gymnastics is the baseball of transplanted Czecho-Slovakian , Swiss and German Americans . Largest of these groups is the 100,000 U.S. Bohemians who be long to the worldwide Sokol organization ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyrs of Prague . Next largest group is the American Turners , a confederation of German-descended Turner Societies . <P> At last week 's meet , the Sokols and Turners outnumbered all other entries . For the fourth year , the Philadelphia Turners ' chunky , bespectacled Pearl Nightingale flew off with the women 's all-round championship . Only on the balance beam , where contestants go through nerve-racking slow-motion acrobatics , was Champion Nightingale bested by any rival . The men 's all-round title went to stocky little Arthur Pitt of the Swiss Gymnastic Society of Union City , N.J. <P> Apparatus events are the backbone of gymnastics . But far more exciting to galleries are the tumbling events . For the sheer fun of it , contestants perform the same stunts that once kept Japanese tumblers in big-time vaudeville . The tumbler who brought down the house last week was a 15-year-old schoolgirl , dimpled , curly-headed Bonnie Nebelong . Into her minute-and-a-half performance , she packed so many spine-tingling contortions and body twists that the judges had eyes for no one else .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
