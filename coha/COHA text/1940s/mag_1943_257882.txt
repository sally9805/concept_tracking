President Roosevelt has for the last several years regarded the press less as the main instrument of public information than as an annoying Paul Pry , a kind of powerful Peeping Tom , bent on general snoopery . He has kept reporters at bay whenever he could . U.S. reporters and photographers were left on shore when Mr. Roosevelt met Winston Churchill in mid-ocean to draft the Atlantic Charter ( the British press was present ) . After the Casablanca Conference was all over , newsmen were herded sheeplike for a staged news conference at which no questions could be asked . Mindful of the need for military secrecy , the press did not complain . <P> Last week the President for the first time applied the rules of military secrecy to a nonmilitary event . He changed an earlier plan to allow reporters to attend the United Nations food conference at Hot Springs , Va . May 18 , and banned them , save for two plenary sessions at the beginning and the end . His reason : so that representatives may pursue their discussions without distractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In effect , the U.S. will be told only what the Administration chooses to tell . <P> All newsmen saw in this decision an unwarranted invasion of freedom of the press , and said so . Most plain-spoken was Scripps-Howard Columnist Raymond Clapper , who seldom gets angry in print . This time he did . Said he : <P> TIME , April 19 , 1943 <P> " This . . . does n't do the President 's judgment much credit . He is persisting in it in the face of the most vigorous objection from Elmer Davis , head of OWI , and I think from the State Department people themselves . . . . <P> " This is not a military conference . There is no reason for secrecy at all-not a single reason that any official can offer honestly except that Mr. Roosevelt wants it , and he wants it because he found it so much more pleasant at Casablanca not to have newspaper reporters around . <P> " We newspaper workers are not , perhaps , the most likable people in the world . We may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given us had we all been rich men 's sons . . . . <P> " But we do try to learn and understand what is going on . All that can be said in our behalf is that we are hired to try as best we can to keep the American people informed about their Government . At least we are still assuming it is our Government-the Government that people are paying taxes to finance , buying bonds to support and for which their sons are dying in tropical jungles and dirty Africa .
