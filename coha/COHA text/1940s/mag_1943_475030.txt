viceroRy will present challenges to American farsightedness , generosity , and realism in international affairs comparable with those of the war itself . Indeed we may be obliged to consider postwar problems of relief and long-range commercial dealings with other countries in a less favorable psychological atmosphere than that which war generates . A people will make almost any sacrifice of blood and treasure for the sake of victory , but this sacrificial mood almost invariably evaporates swiftly after the last shot has been fired . As soon as the compound of emotions excited by war patri-otic loyalty , desire to prove combat superiority , hatred of the enemy , and fear of the consequences of defeat ? is dissipated with the coming of peace there is a tendency to count pennies where dollars were formerly squandered without question . The political problems and responsibilities which we shall face in the future lie outside the scope of this article . It is concerned with the economic relations which we shall establish with the outside world when it is no longer necessary to concentrate all our productive energies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global war . We shall face the immediate task of doing what we can to relieve enormous misery -- amounting in the worst cases to outright famine over great areas of Europe , and probably in east Asia as well . This task will be more difficult because we shall be giving not out of the comfortable abundance which made it easy to extend succor to victims of man-made or natural disasters in foreign lands in the past , but out of deprivations such as we have not known since the Civil War . We already realize from experience what inroads on our supposedly inexhaustible food reserves have been made by a combination of the features of a war economy : full employment at high money wages , the draining away of farm labor to the armed forces and the munitions factories , the drafting of millions of men for military service , and the requirements of lend-lease shipments to Allied powers . These inroads will be multiplied as the war continues and will reach their maximum intensity when hundreds of millions of Europeans , of whom great numbers have been living for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reached with our supplies . But we know that somehow this problem will be solved , that Americans will never stand by and permit famine and pestilence to ravage an accessible part of the world without making every effort to check such a catastrophe . Yet even now we should be thinking out a satisfactory answer to a problem which will face us after this preliminary task is done : haw to organize our foreign economic relations , how to shape our trade and investment policies , in a world in which many old landmarks of international commerce and finance will have been submerged in the flood of total war . Should we seek to play Atlas to foreign countries , seeking to sustain them indefinitely by subsidizing their economies through a continuation of the lend-lease method , or in some other way ? Or should we revert to the laissez-faire of the twenties ? II 7 BELIEVE that both these policies are undesirable in themselves , and I believe that the first , especially , would not stand a chance of approval by public opinion after the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry and medicines to the sick , even if this means an extra year or two of belt-tightening . But any long-range scheme that could be plausibly represented as proposing to subsidize foreign peoples indefinitely , at the expense of the American taxpayer and the American consumer , can expect nothing but a resounding " No " from a people that will have become highly tax-conscious and ration-conscious . It is significant , I think , that when Vice President Wallace expressed the opinion last year that the war is being fought to assure everyone in the world a quart of milk a day he provoked an explosive controversy . The retiring president of the National Association of Manufacturers , Mr. W. P. Witherow , retorted that he was not fighting to give a quart of milk to every Hottentot , nor yet to build a TVA on the Danube . And this was only one of many criticisms that led Mr. Wallace to protest that his speech had been misinterpreted . No doubt some of the attacks on the Vice President were prompted by partisan antagonism ur by misunderstanding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of speech in the context of an expressed hope for improved living standards for all peoples in the future . Every reasonable person would subscribe to this desire , although it may be difficult to believe in the swift achievement of this objective after a war that has been characterized by unprecerecent and more concrete pronouncement Mr. Wallace has put forward moderate economic suggestions : that tariff walls be lowered and that America provide ' guidance , technical advice , and in some cases capital " for economically less developed nations . But it was not altogether the result of accident or of malice that Mr. Wallace 's phrase should have touched off a sharp debate . For the idea that America should assume the role of an economic Atlas in the postwar world , prolonging the lend-lease method of transferring goods and supplies abroad , financing and underwriting huge public-works developments in China and other economically backward countries , and not worrying much about repayment , has figured prominently in some blueprints for the future . It stems from a fairly influential school of new economics which favors heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic ills , and which looks benevolently at the idea of putting large parts of the world on a WPA basis . It is sometimes argued that rationing and heavy taxation must continue after the end of the war , not only as a temporary antidote to inflation , but permanently as a means of insuring full employment and world reconstruction . Now in a democracy the shaping of foreign policies , political and economic , must always take account of public opinion . And American public opinion is being formed against a background of unusual restrictions and deprivations , which will inevitably become more severe as the war continues . Even now , when the emotional appeal of the war itself silences open criticism , there is an undercurrent of grumbling about the hardships and inconveniences of rationing and the shortages which make rationing necessary . This is perhaps especially true in the Middle West , where the Chicago Tribune , while supporting the war , keeps up its feud with the Administration and enjoys a wide influence . I picked up a copy of Colonel McCormick 's newspaper when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first letter in the correspondence columns was to the general effect that we are giving away our consumption goods and plant facilities recklessly to Russia and other foreign lands and ended with the sarcastic suggestion that we should need a barrel to clothe our nakedness by the time this process was ended . The second letter mentioned a report that horse meat was to be put on sale for human consumption and observed with considerable acerbity that no doubt horse meat would he considered good enough for Americans , while more desirable viands would be shipped abroad . It is of course a matter of record , as is often emphasized in official public statements , that lend-lease shipments have so far taken only a small fraction of our total food production . But people who resent unaccustomed deprivations are seldom responsive to logical argument . Unable openly to criticize the war , they are quick to strike the note that other countries are being pampered while America 's needs are neglected . And what is a minor undercurrent during the war may well become a very strong tide when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , important to remember that there is a considerable difference between the European and the American reaction to rationing . The European has been conditioned to it from the stern experiences of the First World War . He is used to seeing the value of money heavily diluted by controls and restrictions . But this is not true as regards the American . As a rule he has often known the kind of deprivation that comes from not having enough money in his pocket to buy all that he wants . But the experience of going into a stare with a full pocketbook and finding the shelves bare of what he desires is novel and disconcerting . The great majority of Americans will certainly loyally accept rationing , high taxes , transportation and heating difficulties , and other deprivations as a contribution to the price of victory ( and a very small contribution , compared with what is being offered by the fighting men ) . But they will , in my judgment , reply with an emphatic " No " if they should be asked to perpetuate these features of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will promise an abatement of taxes and an abundance of goods will be irresistible . Americans will have learned by the convincing method of personal experience that their country is not an inexhaustible horn of plenty . And this discovery will not predispose them to the reckless assumption of an Atlas role in relation to the outside world . Ill wo other points are worth considering when we try to forecast the psychological mood in which postwar economic arrangements will have to be discussed . First , coalition wars seldom end in a mood of hearty good fellowship among the participants . We need only recall the feelings , certainly far from enthusiastic , with which the average American doughboy left France in 1919 or the not infrequent acid bickering between ourselves and the British during the twenties . The organization called America First dissolved itself after Pearl Harbor . But an America First mood , lusty if not truculent , highly suspicious of any proposal that could be construed as giving away presents to foreigners on silver platters , is likely to be very strong after the war , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great war , if it does not lead to violent revolution , is likely to be followed , at least temporarily , by a phase of passivity , if not of actual reaction , in social and economic progress . If there is no revolutionary overturn to release new forces and pose new problems ( and I should strongly doubt whether there is enough articulate , coherent discontent and desire for a definite new pattern in the social order to make revolution a reasonable postwar prospect ) such familiar postwar reactions as fatigue , letdown from tension , aversion to novelties that may require further sacrifices , are almost certain to assert themselves . The sharply more conservative character of the first American wartime Congress is an omen worth watching . Mr. Roane Waring , national commander of the American Legion , recently emitted a full-throated blast that will find many echoes after the order to cease fire of soldiers at Fort Bragg , Mr. Waring declared , according to the United Press : When this war is over there will be more freak isms , more utopian crackpots , social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will trot out schemes for bringing on the millennium . They will advocate all kinds of panaceas for the troubles of the world except honest-to-goodness hard work . Your job will be to fight them to the last ditch . These fellows are charlatans and economic quacks . After the war " freak isms , utopian crackpots , and long-haired reformers " may well become scapegoats for many popular grievances . And one of the surest ways to get these labels pinned on one will be to advocate sonic plan under which America would be expected to subsidize other countries . So the question whether America after the war will be an Atlas , holding up Europe and Asia on its shoulders indefinitely , can be prctty confidently answered in the negative . No such project could be adopted without Congressional approval . And the American people will never accept such a burden . Nor , for that matter , would any other people , according to historical experience . IV 7.  - -  rms does mean , however , that America will default on its moral obligation to do what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease that will be found over large areas of Europe and Asia after the Axis strength is broken . It also does not mean , one hopes , that there will be a relapse into the shortsighted selfishness of the economic policies that were pursued during the twenties . These policies were not the and directly , brought Hitler into power in Germany and strengthened the grip of the Japanese militarists , thereby paving the way for the incalculable human sufferings and material losses of the Second World War . The alternative to woolly , unrealistic sentimentality in international economic relations need not be narrow , exclusive nationalism . There is the middle way of a policy based on enlightened national sAf-MAGAZINE interest , which reckons with the legitimate interests of other nations . Immediately after the German collapse , when the need will be sharpest and will be aggravated , most probably , by the breakdown of any kind of political authority and economic organization in large areas , government aid must play an important part in relief operations . Indeed , relief in many regions will be inextricably bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by lend-lease or some similar method , of surplus military stocks of food , clothing , and medicines to the governments of the most severely stricken countries will be a step of practical humanity . Later , however , as passions are calmed and the most acute phase of distress is overcome , relief should be handled as a direct humanitarian task and dissociated from lend-lease transactions . ( The two extremes of exaggerated sentimentality and of hardboiled shortsightedness would seem to be represented by those who would wish to prolong lend-lease after the war and those who would exact repayment for lend-lease supplies on the basis of a commercial debt . The most sensible policy , in the light of past war-debt experiences , would be to write off lend-lease shipments as part of the gigantic cost of the war , and to stop these shipments immediately or very soon after the war is over . ) Relief needs will be formidably greater ? and our food reserves , except perhaps in cereals , will be much smaller ? than they were in 1919 and 1920 . But we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We shall dispose of the largest quantity of shipping . And the combined food resources of the American continent should be sufficient to ward off a complete catastrophe , involving , perhaps , greater loss of life than the war itself , in the hardest hit regions of Europe and Asia . Along with the largest material resources America will also possess the most adequate moral reserves for undertaking this gigantic human salvage job . We shall have been less ravaged by war and we shall , one trusts , be less eaten up with hatred than most of the European peo- , there will be many eager volunteers for this work of reconstruction . In this connection , it is interesting to note that there has been a remarkably wide and entirely nonsectarian response , for several years , to the call for unpaid volunteers to work in social-service projects which the American Friends Service Committee has been sponsoring in Mexico . Hundreds of young men and women have gone to work at such varied jobs as helping to rebuild a town that was damaged by an earthquake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privies and drainage canals to reduce the incidence of hookworm and malaria in Vera Cruz Province . The rehabilitation of Europe will make a far wider appeal to idealism and imagination . In this struggle against hunger , disease , and physical degeneration one will probably find working side by side ex-officers , ex-soldiers , and young men whose convictions against violence had sent them to camps for conscientious objectors . Imaginatively handled , this postwar reconstruction may prove one of the most effective means of beginning to dispel the fearful legacy of hatred that the war will leave to the world . But to be effective it must be put as soon as possible on a private basis , paid for by voluntary contributions rather than by government grants financed by taxes . V P ? rHEREAFTER we shall face another 1 problem of even longer range . Once the more elementary relief works have been completed , once life in Europe and east Asia , although destined to be on an appallingly low and hard level for many years to come , can proceed free from the threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with foreign countries on a permanent basis ? Projects that would amount to mortgaging our national substance in the interest of some vaguely conceived world WPA must be firmly ruled out as economically undesirable and politically impracticable . We can learn some useful lessons in what not to do by looking back to the recand obligations as a creditor nation after the last great war . There has perhaps never been a more glaring , inexcusable case of trying to have one 's cake and eat it at the same time than our economic policy , or lack of policy , during the nineteen-twenties . A very large share of our own subsequent worries ? and the world 's ? may be attributed to the fact that we preserved the psychology and economic methods of a debtor country , intent on building up " favorable " trade balances and securing our industries against foreign competition , after circumstances had made us one of the world 's two principal creditor powers . Throughout the nineteenth century London was the world 's financial capital . The savings of British capitalists , large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from railways in Argentina to rubber plantations in Malaya ; and much of the vigorous development of our own West after the Civil War was facilitated by British commercial loans . Now this international system of trade and finance functioned smoothly and progressively until 1914 because England recognized and fulfilled the first obligation of a creditor power . It gave its debtors a chance to pay by throwing open its internal market on a basis of low tariffs , with free admission for most foodstuffs and raw materials . After the First World War the United States became a principal source of capital for the rest of the world , ranking about even with Great Britain in the total of its foreign investments . We dispensed foreign loans with more energy than discrimination ; and between 1915 and 1930 the value of our foreign investments jumped from $2,600,000,000 to $15,675 , - 000,000 . Meanwhile we announced that we would stand for no nonsense about cancellation of war debts ; from 1923 until 1931 we were collecting about $200,000 , - 000 annually from this source , mostly from Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if we wanted our loans to be paid we had to follow England 's example and make our markets accessible to our debtors . Wrinci nf nnr nnlitirlanc. hanIce-rs and Nisiness men , and even our professional economists , seemed unable to understand a proposition that should not have been beyond the comprehension of a student in Economics A : that international trade and finance must be a two-way proposition , with at least a rough balance of in-and out-payments . During those years when we were lending money , usually at high rates of interest , to foreign countries from China to Peru , and when we were claiming as much as we could get on our war debts , we combined a high-pressure sales apparatus for our goods on foreign markets with a suspicious hostility to imports of foreign goods . Our favorable foreign trade balances were enormous ? $4,016,061,000 in 1920 ; $2,949,535,000 in 1921 ; $1,975,883,000 in 1922 ; $1,036,916,000 in 1928 . For a time the negative effects of this policy were masked by heavy additional lending . In effect we lent the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods we sold it . But when depression and panic came upon the world the outward stream of American capital dried up and there could be only one climax to the absurdly unrealistic policy of accumulating IOUs from all parts of the world while refusing to permit our debtors to pay us in the only feasible war ? in goods and services . There was an orgy of bankruptcy , repudiation , suspension of payment . This aggravated very considerably the effects of the crisis and left us stunned and angry , holding large quantities of engraved paper representing the obligations of foreign governments , municipalities , and corporations , and wondering what had hit us . Our balance sheet of transactions with the outside world since 1914 points the lesson for the future . During that period our total favorable balance of merchandise trade was about thirty billion dollars ,  - -  a tidy sum , even in these days of dizzy-figured finance . Our private investments in foreign countries in 1930 were over fifteen billion dollars ; our war debt claims were about ten billions. * What did we get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our main tangible asset is an eminently There is of course some overlapping In these figures . since some of the loans helped to finance our large export surpluses.useless one . Our stock of gold swelled from a little less than two and a half billion dollars in 1920 to nearly twenty-two billion dollars in 1940 . We have sucked in over eighty per cent of the world 's supply of gold ? and thereby have most definitely ensured that gold will never again play an effective monetary role , at least until this maldistribution is corrected . In retrospect , could anything be more irritatingly stupid than our policy , extended over years of increasing crisis in the Pacific , of swapping oil , scrap iron , copper , and other materials that were most valuable assets for the Japanese war machine for gold which was utterly useless to our men in Bataan and Papua and the Solomons7 . A special retrospective bitterness attaches to this type of transaction with Japan , but the whole process of exchanging some twenty billion dollars ' worth of useful American products for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills of Kentucky , was an unhealthy , abnormal kind of international exchange which , one may hope , will never be repeated . Indeed it could not be repeated unless we were childish enough to give back the gold we have accumulated and start all over again . We shall never get on a sound and satisfactory basis of trade with foreign countries until we recognize that in trade it is more blessed to receive than to give . An individual who derived more pleasure from paying out money than from receiving it in the normal course of business would invite suspicion as to his financial sanity . Yet we have been proceeding on just this basis in relation to something much more valuable and real than gold and paper money , namely goods . We have been assuming that it was somehow to our national advantage to ship abroad as much of our own products and to take in exchange as little of other peoples ' as possible . Foreign trade after the present war will start pretty much from scratch , since military exigencies , lend-lease transactions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the background . Two opposed tendencies are already appearing in the framing of our future commercial policy . Secretary Hull is intent on obtaining a renewal of the reciprocal trade pacts which tend to expand the area of low tariffs and trade concessions ; while on the other hand the Board of Economic Warfare , especially in Latin America , has been following the principle of signing long-term contracts for the products of some countries , thereby insuring a favored commercial position for the United States . What is perhaps more important than this difference as to method is that the word BALANCE should be inscribed in capital letters in all our future thinking about foreign trade . One hopes that the postwar world will not be reduced to mere barter , that the international mechanism of currency exchange can be restored to a point where there will be some flexibility in commercial relations . We need not carry the idea of balance to the extreme of buying and selling precisely the same quantities and values of goods in the case of every foreign country . There is such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments with A is accompanied by A 's favorable balance with B , which , in turn , maintains a favorable balance with us . And , as conditions of civilized life are restored , items like tourist expenditures and receipts from shipping will modify the merchandise trade figures . But , for the sake of our own and the world 's economic equilibrium , we should accept the ideal of balanced international economic accounts , which will not leave us very much either in the black or in the red . We must loyally recognize the implications of the proposition that we should be prepared to receive in goods and services as much as we propose to give . We simply can not have a flourishing foreign trade and a Smoot-Hawley tariff at the same time . And when we make a loan to a foreign country we must , if we want our principal and interest back , make room in our own economy for an equivalent amount of the products of the debtor country . Especially since the First World War , our Department of Commerce has prided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were selling their goods on foreign markets . This service in the future should be sup-plemented by an equally intensive effort to stimulate needed and useful imports . Experts on the trade and production of Europe and Asia , Latin America and Africa , familiar with the requirements of our own industries and agriculture , should he working overtime on projects to encourage the importation of those products which we can absorb with the most benefit to our national economy and the least competitive dislocation . Our former happy-go-lucky policy in the matter of foreign lending should be drastically overhauled . Before concluding any loan agreements we must make every reasonable effort to assure repayment in goods . Suppose , for instance , that Mexico wants a loan to rehabilitate its creaking and obsolete railway system . Mexico needs the new rolling stock and rails ; our foundries will benefit from the work . But these considerations alone should not determine the granting of the loan . There should also be a careful examination , by the appropriate economic authorities of the two countries , of the question how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased Mexican exports to the United States , sufficient to cover interest and amortization on the loan . The Soviet Union will very probably want American material and technical aid for the rebuilding of the Dnieprostroi hydroelectric power plant and the many other installations which have been destroyed in the present war . Here also advances of capital and material should he linked up with increased purchases of manganese or other Russian products which we need . Any loans to China should likewise possess the solid economic guaranty , as to repayment , of enlarged American orders for tung oil , tea , silk , tungsten , or whatever other Chinese products we can advantageously use . VI AM inclined to believe that our thinking ji about future reconstruction problems has been clouded and confused by several misconceptions . There will be more internal and fewer external stimuli to economic activity after the war than is generally assumed . I doubt whether we fully realize , even yet , how sharply this war will reduce the normal American standard of living , or how big the compensations will be afterward ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital in restoring and improving this standard of living . The resumption of automobile production , the development of air transportation , the renovation of our overworked railway system , large-scale housing construction , the building up of agricultural production ( especially in meat and dairy products ) , the resumption of output of scores of minor comforts and luxuries all these things will cushion the transition from war to peace economy within the United States . On the other hand , the prospects of effective two-way trade with large areas of the world will be very slight . Europe , one fears , will be a ghastly combination of a poorhouse and a cemetery by the time Hitler cracks up . Its leading industrial plants will have been bombed to the point of pulverization . Its ports will be smashed . Its earth will be scorched . Its railways will be shattered . The gloomiest preview will probably fall short of the reality . Similar conditions will prevail in the Orient . There is little prospect that Japan will hoist the white flag until its industrial cities have been reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant marine sent to the bottom of the ocean . Devastation from the air will have visited the ports and industries in Japanese-occupied territory . We shall be well advised therefore , think , to write off Europe and east Asia as major trade partners for a considerable period after the war . Our best opportunities for trade and investment in the years immediately after the war will most probably lie in this hemisphere , where the direct ravages of war , one may hope , will be nonexistent or slight . Under a carefully planned and supervised trade and investment policy we can expand the production of raw materials in Latin America and promote the industrialization of that part of the world to our mutual benefit . Canada especially should be a profitable trade partner . But here again we mustbe on guard against winning all the chips in the poker game of international trade . We have maintained a steadily favorable balance of trade with our northern neighbor and we are now drawing interest and dividends on four billion dollars of capital invested in Canada , as against Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . The consequent unfavorable balance of payments for Canada was not a serious problem while the Dominion kept up a comfortable surplus of exports to England . But England , stripped bare of gold and foreign holdings by the war , no longer possesses effective purchasing power . Canada in its sales to Great Britain has adopted methods very similar to lend-lease . A serious strain on the Canadian currency is being staved off by a combination of wartime restrictions on the free movement of currency in Canada and some temporary palliative measures which we have put into force to stimulate buying of Canadian raw materials . After the war , if the two countries are indisposed to enter a customs union , we shall have to consider carefully how we can bring our balance of payments with Canada into equilibrium , at least until England becomes again a factor in free international trade . We have suffered acutely in the past from a sense of split personality in our international economic relations . The protectionist tradition that our manufacturers and workers should be safeguarded against the competition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet many of our big corporations and millions of our farmers are geared to foreign markets and would suffer acutely if these markets were cut off . Universal free trade at the present time is as unrealizable as a world government that would abrogate all national sovereignties . Even if we should want it we could not have it , because other countries would not accept it . The Soviet system of state-controlled economy completely excludes free trade of the Adam Smith type and substitutes the practice of planned trade , along with planned industrial production . And it seems reasonable to anticipate that Great Britain and other large powers , after the economic shocks of the war , will find themselves obliged to employ their trade as a bargaining asset , to keep a pretty tight rein on the commercial and financial international transactions of their citizens for a long time . But if we are alive to our true economic interests we shall use our influence and commercial bargaining power to see that there are the fewest possible obstacles to flourishing reciprocal trade . America can not and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hoped , however , that we have become sufficiently adult economically to abjure once for all the delusive folly , equally harmful to ourselves and to other countries , of maintaining a high tariff wall and simultaneously trying to hawk our goods and capital in all the markets of the world . The sane middle course between the undesirable extremes of soft-headed sentimentality and thick-headed selfishness is to face up to the big job , which we have never undertaken in the past , of integrating our economy with the world 's , of recognizing in all our tariff and loan arrangements that profitable international economic intercotirse must be a two-way street . We should pursue a policy of enlightened self-interest , shaping trade and investment policies that will help ourselves and help our partners at the same time . Then we need not fear that foreigners will fairly reproach us for being " Uncle Shylock " ? or that we shall have occasion to reproach ourselves for being Uncle Sap .                  @ @ @
