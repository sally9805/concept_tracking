txt RED CALLS WITNESS AT TRIAL HERE ' RAT ' FBI Agent , Who Was at Party Meeting Night Before , Draws Fire of a Defendant By RUSSELL PORTER American Communists are taught the need for violent revolution and also for denying this with a pretense of merely " predicting " violence , according to yesterday 's evidence at the Communist trial . This testimony was given by Balmes Hidalgo Jr .. a young war veteran and employe of the Colonial Trust Company , Forty-eighth Street and Avenue of the Americas . He was the Government 's thirteenth witness and the seventh who has served in the Communist party as an undercover agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . He attended his final party meeting Tuesday night . The witness identified three defendants as having spoken at meetings he attended . One of these , Robert Thompson , the party 's New York State chairman , then called the witness a " little rat . " Federal Judge Harold R. Medina rebuked the defense for this " disorder . " for trying to " frighten " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for " sneering " at the court and for trying to abuse the administration of justice for " publicity . " The judge warned defense counsel he was contemplating action to expedite the trial because of new delaying tactics . Mr. Hidalgo told of Communistil plans to train youth for party lead-1 ership " as Hitler did " and to run New York City , after the revolution , with 10,000 " good " Commu // RED CALLS WITNESS AT TRIAL HERE ' RAT ' // nists . He described party " concentration " among youth , Negroes , Spanish and Italian groups , and power and communication workers whose grievances they hoped to enlist in making a revolution . The party had two special clubs for New York teachers , he said , in addition to doctors , dentists , nurses and other " professionals " in other clubs . Eleven members of the party 's American Politburo or national board are being tried for conspiracy to teach and advocate violent overthrow of the Government . Mr. Hidalgo corroborated previous testimony that on orders from Moscow the Communists used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social revolution , how to seize power from the revolutionaries in an anti-democratic counter-revolution with the aid of Soviet Russia , and how to perpetuate themselves in power like the Russian Bolsheviks . Mr. Hidalgo was questioned by Frank H. Gordon , special assistant to the Attorney General . The witness enlisted in the National Guard in 1919 , and in 1940 was taken into the United States forces as an infantryman . He was discharged from service in December , 1943 . The witness said he was recruited into the party in November , 1946. by a man named Alex Munsell , who told him veterans were getting a " raw deal and could not get aid from anybody but the Communists . " Mr. Hidalgo said he did not join , the party until after he had talked with the FBI . Before being accepted by the party , he said , he was told by Mr. Munsell to see Mrs. Grace Cane at her apartment in the West Seventies . FBI " Worst Enemy " " She said , " the witness testified , " some day soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist party , much like we 'd have here in the United States when the time was ripe . She said the FBI was the worst enemy of the party and when the time came they would fight the FBI , the police , the Army and the National Guard . ' Do n't forget , ' she said , ' we have 10,000 veterans of World War II in the party . " Mr. Hidalga told of an " educational " class at the Tom Paine club in the spring of 1947 at the home of Abner Levine , club chairman . Lenin 's " State and Revolution " was discussed . " A girl named Betty , " the witness said , " read a passage from this book , saying replacement of the bourgeois by the proleterian state was impossible without a violent revolution . " It was at this point that virtually automatic defense objections to every Government question led Judge Medina to issue his warning on delay . Eugene Dennis , the party 's general secretary , protested against this as " intimidation . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimidation but " have had enough tried on me in this case . " At this point , United States Attorney John F. X. moved a recess , which was granted . After the recess , the witness said the " girl named Betty " told the Tom Paine club that American Communists realize there has to be violent overthrow of the Government to achieve their aims . " But she told them , " the witness added , " if anybody ever accuses us of this our answer is no , we just predict it . " " Security " Tightened Up The witness said a new organizer named " Julie " was sent to tighten up " security " regulations at the Thomas Jefferson club in the spring of 1947 . The witness later learned this man used " Katz " and " O'Donnell " as interchangeable last names . " Julie " gave instructions , according o the witness/ for members to use no last names , only firse names or numbers : not to use their names on the telephone and not to send cut mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julie gave orders for the four section groups to specialize on " concentration , infiltration and recruiting " in different industrial and racial elements of New York . The party wanted to be ready to " control " these elements in case of a revolution , the witness quoted Julie . He said special orders were given to concentrate on longshoremen and the New York Central Railroad yards . Negro recruits had to be segregated and sent to a Harlem address , he said . Mr. Hidalgo identified Benjamin J. Davis Jr. , a City Councilman , as a speaker of a state-wide " party building congress " of 1,000 persons in the New York City Center in June , 1947 . A man identified only as " Comrade George , " according to the witness , won first prize for recruiting in the " waterfront brigade led by Ben Davis . " He also quoted Thompson as saying the world was divided into two camps , in which American " imperialism " stood against the " peace " camp represented by the " truly democratic countries such as Hungary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Hidalgo said Mr. Thompson told American Communists they would have to take the " peace " camp . Davis acted with dignifiedsilence when identified , but defendant Thompson snarled " keep your hands off me ! " as the witness approached . Mr. Hidalgo did not touch him , but said : " This is Comrade Thompson . " Witness Called " Rat " " You 're no comrade of mine , you little rat . " replied the defendant . Mr. Hidalgo walked briskly back to the witness stand . The witness testified he was selected by the party to attend a leadership school at the Jefferson School of Social Science , 57 Avenue of the Americas , in July . 1947 . According to the witness , the twenty " students " were told they had been selected for training as leadership material . Elizabeth Lawson , an instructor , he said , told them American democracy was really " imperialism " and " fascism " just like Hitlerism . She quoted Georg Drnitroff 's 1935 report to the Communist International in Moscow , and told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dmitroff used " Germany . " This meant , he said , American Communists were justified in fighting their own Government as " fascist " and " imperialist . " The witness said Ben Simonofsky of the county " educational " department told the class their day-to-day party tasks must be carried out faithfully as ' tactics " to achieve the ultimate strategic aim of violent overthrow of capitalism . " He said this must be done , " the witness added , " because these tasks were fixed by the 1935 World Congress of the Comintern . He said we could not disagree with any part of this because if we did we would be disagreeing with Comrade Stalin , whom no one had ever proved wrong . " Told to Take New Name In November , 1947 , the witness said , he was told to turn in his party membership card by , his club organizer on orders from above . He said he was told to take a new flame , which he did , and a new card was issued to him in the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons , " the witness testified , " I might not want to be known . " Mr. Hidalgo quoted Morty Kamen , organizational secretary of the Thomas Jefferson section at a meeting in June , 1948 , as saying : " The Young Communist League has supplied the Communist party leadership of today . We must indoctrinate all youths up to 25 in socialistic ideas . We must use the youth as Hitler did . They will serve us as well . " With 10,000 ' good ' Communists we can rule New York City . We do n't aheed a majority . We only need to tell the majority what to think . " The witness identified John Gates , editor of The Daily Worker , as telling a meeting of county and section press directors about that time that " officially we are not an . official party organ , but it is a well known fact we really are .
