A thumping headache last week followed the shopping spree which sent U.S. citizens scurrying into stores to buy before the stiff new Federal excise taxes clamped down , Oct. 1 . They woke to find that , on purchases made after the new tax went into effect , they not only had to pay the increased tax but several times the tax increase , because of the retailers ' time-honored system of price markups . <P> On liquor , which caused the biggest rush , the tax increase is a flat $1 a gallon . For a quart of whiskey the additional tax amounts to 25 ; for a fifth , it comes to 20 . But whiskey buyers this week found that prices had gone up as much as 50 a quart , 35 a fifth . On radios , the additional tax is 4% , bringing the total Federal tax to 10% . But radio prices are up a full 10% or more . <P> Standard retail markups run as high as 50% of the wholesale price , and higher . A refrigerator costing a retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase ( 10% ) were merely passed on , the new price to the customer would be $107.50 . But with tax added to the wholesale cost , and the markup pyramided on that , the price the customer pays is $111 . <P> Price Administrator Leon Henderson last week took note of this inflationary threat . Price rises , he warned retailers , " should in no case reflect more than the actual dollar amount of the . . . excise tax . " But retail merchants paid him little mind . Most of them went merrily on their way , marking up tax and all .
