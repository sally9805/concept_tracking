POCOCK PASSES A Story V. S. PRITCHETT T un cities fall , but what survives ? It is the common , patient , indigenous grass . After Mr. Pocock 's death this thought lay in a muddle in Rogers ' mind ; if Rogers had a mind . He was enormously fat ; a jellyfish which is washed and rocked by sensations and not by thought . The Wilcoxes , the Stockses and Rogerses , the three ordinary , far-back tribes who made the village , alone had history ; and this plain corporate history , like the eternal grass , choked out the singular blooms . The death of a Rogers is something . A card is shuffled into another pack and he joins the great phalanx of village Rogerses beyond the grave , formidable in their anonymity . But the death of a stranger like Pocock , who had been in the place only a few months , was like a motor smash . Vivid but trivial , it sank out of village memory to the bottom of time . Rogers admitted to himself that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of fifty like himself , as fat as Rogers was , too  --  they had compared waist measurements once  --  and he drank heavily : that came home rather close . So close that although Rogers was Mr. Pocock 's only friend in the last months of his life , Rogers could not bring himself to go to the funeral . He put on his black to show willingness , but at the hour of the funeral slipped on the doorstep and twisted his knee and had to be kept in his house . With a sort of penitence or hoping for a last order , ' Askew , the village publican , went -- he followed all his customers to the end  --  and came back saying : " Mr. Pocock , he drank too much . I often tried to stop him . " Then it was that Rogers , who had gone down to the pub once the funeral was over and Pocock was set in his grave  --  then it was that Rogers saw a profound truth : " You 're wrong there , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The trouble with Mr. Pocock was that he did n't drink enough . " One thing the death of Mr. Pocock did for Rogers was to make him stay at home . There was nothing to go out for . Outside was the road , the village , the four-eyed faces of the villas called Heart 's Desire Estate which Rogers had built on the flat fields and had sold before anyone had discovered that the site was a water meadow . There was his wooden but too , where he slept over the typewriter sometimes , and with its Estate Agent 's plate on the door . His wife ran his business now  --  such as it was . Above all this was the sky . He was inclined to see a hole in things like the street or sky after Pocock 's death , a hole with simply nothing beyond it . Staying at home with his family kept Rogers from seeing the hole . Hearing his wife use the typewriter or telephone in the office , drinking a cup of tea , listening to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay down like a dog in the domestic basket . " Wife and family  --  you 're lucky , ol ' boy , " Mr. Pocock had said many times in line , and the load forced his short legs apart on either side of the chair , like the splayed , speckled legs of a frog . And there was another bond . Mr. Pocock , it was evident , was a drinker . A gentleman , too ( Rogers observed ) , as the evening went on , arrogantly free with money . A sportsman also . There were a couple of illustrated papers on the table and one had a photograph of tropical game . A peeress had taken these photographs . One showed a hippopotamus rising like a sofa out of a lake . " Damn ' cruel , old boy , " said Mr. Pocock in a grating gasp , having an imaginary row with the aristocracy and Rogers about it . " All these bloody white women following poor defenseless animals around with cameras , old boy . Bloody hippopotamus ca n't even drink in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what ? " Yes , Mr. Pocock was a sportsman , a blaspheming sportsman of some elegance , for now Rogers noticed a couple of rings on one hand . Yet not a sportsman , after all , for he looked bored when Rogers spoke of the duck and snipe and the teal which float Eke commas on the meres at the back of the village . " Ca n't eat it , old boy , " replied Pocock . " Game 's poison to me . Bloody waste of time following birds , if you ask me . Need every ounce of daylight for my work . " The bell on the table was tapped again and again . In and out went Askew , the publican . Even he straightened up under the snapping orders of Mr. Pocock . A ID there was no reserve in Mr. Pocock . His talk was free and self-explanatory . " I 've come down here to see if there is anything , " said Pocock . " If there is , well and good . If not , all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " wondered Rogers . ) " I 've got to , old boy , " said Mr. Pocock . " I 've got to cut down the overheads . Have another , old boy ? With this bloody crisis , " he said with an angry and frightened look in his eyes . " I had my own studio in London and a housekeeper , but with this crisis , and the critics in league against you , the bottom 's gone out of things . There maybe something here  --  I do n't know  --  two rooms , a bed , a table , do my own cleaning up and cooking  --  that 's all I want and no women about . No , " said Mr. Pocock , " no more women . " You married , old boy ? " asked Mr. Pocock . " Yes , " said Rogers . " You 're lucky , old boy , " said Mr. Pocock . " Bloody lucky . Excuse my language , old boy , but woman 's a b " Oh , fifty-fifty , " said Rogers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly lucky to have a wife he could share everything with , she doing the office work and looking after his house while he built up his figure and did the drinking . For Rogers had reached the point of saturation in his own life when drinking was work . It never stopped . Rogers ' slow mind wanted to explain , but Pocock interrupted . " I know , old boy . You ca n't tell me anything about women . They 're a bloody question mark , old boy . There 's two answers to it , one 's right and one 's wrong . When I want what I want , I do n't ask anyone 's opinion , I go and get it . " " What ? " added Mr. Pocock . " You 're right , " said Rogers in his slow , groping voice . " You know the story of the couple who . . . " They did n't laugh out loud at the story . Rogers shook and shook and his eyes sank out of sight , Mr. Pocock strained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle of soda water . " It 's nature , " said Mr. Pocock when his head stopped fizzing . Rogers was out of his depth here . His head was lolling forward . He had reached the stage when Mr. Pocock had a tendency to rise to the ceiling and then to drift away sideways toward the door in great numbers . " Take salmon , " said Rogers heavily , this coming into his mind at the moment . " Salmon , old boy ? Why bloody salmon ? " said Mr. Pocock . " They go .. . " said Rogers . " They go ? up fresh water . " " Salmon ? " said Mr. Pocock . " Salmon ? They come from the sea . " " They do n't breed in it , " said Rogers uncertainly . He was beginning to forget evening , " Mrs. Rogers said . She was a plump , practical woman , with hair set like a teacake . She was a onetime nurse , abnormally goad-tempered , pleasantly unimaginative . She ate well and enjoyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband . Incapable herself of his deterioration , hers was the craving , so strong in the orderly and new , for its opposite : the romantic ruin . Rogers , like many men , and especially drinking men , who neglect their wives and are slowly ruining their families , had an ideal picture of his family in his mind , a picture to which his fancy was always putting more delicate touches of reminiscence . For , like all the world beyond his hazy corpulence , his family became remote , a little farther away each day , like a memory of an old master . " Bloody funny thing , old boy , " Mr. Pocock said . " When I paint a picture , I get the feeling I have for a woman . " It was Rogers ' feeling about his own picture , of his family , that private masterpiece of his . Rogers was n't interested in any other pictures ; Mr. Pocock was n't interested in domestic life . And " The Crown " was placed strategically between their homes . BOUT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he " broke out . " He always had . He always would . There was a large manufacturing town with a river , pleasure boats and a Hippodrome twenty miles away , where life , said Rogers , abounded . He and Mr. Pocock put roses in their buttonholes , cigars in their mouths and went . Rogers explained that he had n't seen quite so much life since he was married , but when he was a youngster . . . Oh , dear . This stirred up memories in Mr. Pocock . They arrived and , to make a start , went to the station buffet . After this the past was vivid . They went to the Hippodrome for the second act of a play about divorce . The seats were narrow and Mr. Pocock said he could n't breathe . They left . Mr. Pocock said all this modern stuff was dirty . Nothing but sex . ( What 's yours , old boy ? ) Dirt , like Epstein and Uzanne , The Iast train back was the 12:17 . It brought the Hippodrome people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron and glass facade seemed unattainable , but at last , after a long time on the curb opposite , they rushed it . The train was crowded . Rogers had been sorry to leave the Hippodrome . He smiled , wagging his head , thinking about it , then he began to laugh and nudge his neighbors . They were soon entertained by Rogers . It was like the old days . " I 've been divorced today , " Rogers suddenly said ; " and he 's my co-respondent . " Mr. Pocock at once offered him a cigarette . Rogers refused . " Why do you refuse my cigarettes , old boy ? " Mr. Pocock asked abruptly . He was out for a quarrel . " Do you think I want your wife ? " exclaimed Mr. Pocock angrily . Rogers laughed idiotically . " Because you 're a swine if you do , " said Mr. Pocock . But they did n't fight . They got out . at their station , helped out by the passengers , and the guard . while the engine driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Damned awful , old boy , " said Mr. Pocock . " Come in , " said Rogers when they got to his house . A look of sobered terror came into Mr. Pocock 's face . " Your wife in ? " he said . " She 's in bed , " Rogers said . " Thank God , " said Mr. Pocock . " I 'm drunk . " " Come in , " said Rogers . " She 'd hear my language , " said Mr. Pocock . Rogers opened the door and led the way into the sitting room . Mr. Pocock sat down while Rogers went to the whiskey bottle . " It 's empty , old man , " Rogers said , looking blankly at Mr. Pocock . " Thank God , old boy . " Mr. Pocock stood appalled , like a man who had never been in an inhabited house before . He looked shocked . He saw with horror the cretonne-covered sofa , the photographs , the slim silver vases with maidenhair fern in them . " She 's taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Women , " said Mr. Pocock . went to bed early . In the middle of the night he woke up in black terror . He felt sick and he was fainting , and he was sure he was in London . He reached for his stick and knocked on the floor to make the woman come up to him , the woman whose portrait Rogers had seen and who lived downstairs . All the night sleeping and waking he dreamed he was knocking to make himself heard on the floor . For the model , then for Mrs. Rogers , then for his mother . In the morning he could hardly move . Then he remembered he was on the ground floor and had been knocking on the carpet which covered the flags , which covered the earth . He had been knocking on the hard crust of the earth . All he could do was to crawl from his bed to the cupboard where the whiskey bottle was and then crawl back . But he called no one ; he stiffened with anger if there were any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to be caught like this . He was not going to admit anything . He cursed the doctor . It was two days before Mr. Pocock 's illness was discovered . " Mr. Pocock 's ill , " Rogers ' wife brought the news . She knew all the illnesses of the village . Rogers sat up , alert . He was at once frightened for himself . He did not want to see Mr. Pocock before the doctor had been . Rogers sat in his chair , unable to move . He wanted to do something for Mr. Pocock , but he was paralyzed . He sat in a stupor of inertia and incompetence . He looked appealingly at his wife . She got a car and had Mr. Pocock brought to the house . " It 's the bloody sugar , old boy , " murmured Mr. Pocock with a regal weariness as three men carried him upstairs . Mrs. Rogers was glad when the ambulance came that , for once in his life , Mr. Pocock had had a real home with a woman to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEALER came down to look at the pictures after the funeral , but he would not take them . One or two others c-me hoping for frames . But the twenty-odd canvases there had no frames on them . A brother came down to clear up Mr. Po-cock 's affairs . " We never corresponded , " said the brother . Of all things he was a clergyman . Two fair and tall young men in suede shoes and pullovers , so alike they looked like a pair of tap dancers , turned up at the same time . They were tap dancers . " Terrible , " they said . They were looking at the pictures ; but Rogers supposed they referred to the death , the poverty of the house  --  or perhaps the clergyman . Rogers had been told by Mr. Pocock that in reward for his kindness he might have one of the pictures , but he did not know which to choose , The only picture he felt anything about was the picture on the bedroom wall , the nude . He detested it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been Mr. Pocock 's trouble . Not drink . Oh dear , not drink , women . " So when everyone had gone , he took the small picture , wrapped it in newspaper and put it in a shed in his garden . That picture , and a corkscrew which he stuffed in his pocket , because a corkscrew was useful . He took the picture because , without knowing it , he felt it symbolized the incomprehensibility of the existence of other people . The corkscrew was the man he knew , the picture the man he did not know at all . He thought that.one day he had better destroy the picture  --  in case a bad impression of his friend was formed . And so , slipping out of the funeral , keeping in the background afterwards , staying in his own house , Rogers eluded the memory of Mr. Pocock . Rogers was forgetting everything as he grew larger . He forgot yesterday , last week , last year  --  he dreamed through time like an idle whale , with its mouth open , letting what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own work of art  --  his family . He watched his wife 's second chin when she gave her practical laugh . His two girls swam up to him like fish . They were an extra pair of eyes and ears for him . They saw things quickly . They laughed at things long before he heard them . On Saturdays he took them to the cinema . Every Saturday . A year passed , and then two years . He never said now : " We had Mr. Pocock , the painter , here . " He had learned his lesson .
