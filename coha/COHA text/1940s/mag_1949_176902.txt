On Buenos Aires newsstands last week , the newest and slickest magazine was a monthly called Argentina . Packed with pictures and color , it had a heavy concentration of anti-American articles . They discussed the iniquities of U.S. comic strips , the horrors of U.S. " boastfulness , " and U.S. failure to recognize Argentine greatness . Argentina , aimed at the Argentine intelligentsia , carried little advertising . Its editor was Secretary of Education Oscar Ivanissevich , 53 , onetime ambassador to the U.S. <P> In the eleven months since he returned from Washington , suave " Ivan " Ivanissevich has proved himself the most versatile of all the men around Pern . He had hardly settled down at home before he had a chance to add a couple of cubits to his considerable stature as a surgeon . Amid blaring Peronista publicity , he took out the President 's appendix ( TIME , March 15 ) . From surgery he moved to culture , soon became the high priest and top philosopher of Peronism . <P> Good Food . Ivan never stoops to understatement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buenos Aires rally : " When in Washington , far away from the fatherland , in the solitude of the embassy , I first read of the , rights of labor as propounded by our President , I was so moved that I instinctively and reverently stood up . " <P> La Seora gets her share of praise , too . " Thanks to Seora Pern , " he said recently , " more than 600,000 schoolchildren now have clothes , good food , books and games . " As Secretary of Education , Ivan himself has shepherded 300,000 schoolchildren on " useful vacations " designed to get them better acquainted with their own country . <P> The recent election campaign drew from Serb-descended Ivan still further proof of his versatility . One night in Tucumn he dashed off a poem , declaimed it at a Peronista meeting . Set to lively music , it rapidly became the party 's official song : <P> We Peronista boys <P> Fighting together <P> Will ever cry <P> With heartfelt joy <P> Viva Pern ! Viva Pern ! <P> A Bolero . Surgeon Ivanissevich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presidential party on a long , dusty train ride back to the capital from the interior , Evita Pern said : " Ivan , why do n't you sing us a bolero ? " The courtly , white-suited , white-tied Secretary dug out a guitar , swung into a popular number called Luna Lunera . <P> In his job as Secretary of Education , Ivan has charge of the making of a government film epic on the life of San Martin . Recently , he summoned Argentina 's top movie actors to his office , assigned them roles . The one part left unfilled was that of the Liberator . The actors went away with a strong impression that Oscar Ivanissevich was saving it for himself .
