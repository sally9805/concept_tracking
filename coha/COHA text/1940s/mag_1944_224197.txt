The matter was most awfully urgent . The Dowager Duchess of Devonshire dashed up to London to see her son , Edward William Spencer Cavendish , 10th Duke of Devonshire , and his stately wife , the Lady Mary Alice Gascoyne-Cecil . Lady Mary 's mother , the Marchioness of Salisbury , thought it wise to come , too . Reluctantly the Duke agreed that he was the one to speak to his headstrong son- &-heir,; William John Robert Cavendish , Marquess of Hartington and a Captain in the Coldstream Guards . <P> The Marquess , 26 , proposed to marry an American , a Boston girl named Kathleen Kennedy . The Marquess had been mentioned as a suitable suitor for the hand of Princess Elizabeth . Kathleen 's father was Joseph P. Kennedy , wealthy , Irish and no admirer of the British . He had been a popular U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James 's , who had later thrown away his popularity and then some. * What was more , the Kennedys were good Catholics ; the Cavendishes have been strenuously Protestant since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Dowager Duchess and the Marchioness , not to speak of the Kennedys , might have seen it coming . Kathleen had been going with the Marquess since 1938 , when Ambassador Joe brought her to London . Paddling about London on a bicycle and working at an American Red Cross Club in Knightsbridge since last summer , Kathleen continued to see the Marquess . Last winter she visited West Derbyshire , when the Marquess tried and failed to win a seat in the House of Commons ( TIME , Feb. 28 ) . Apparently , everybody-except the Cavendishes and the Kennedys-understood that Kathleen and the Marquess were as good as engaged . <P> But the actual prospect of marriage hit the Cavendishes hard . One of England 's oldest and loftiest family trees swayed perceptibly . <P> Slow Growth . The Cavendish family first appeared in 1366 , when Sir John , the lord of Cavendish Overhall , acquired a seat on the King 's Bench . In 1530 Sir William placed a firm foundation under the family fortunes while serving as a commissioner for Henry VIII .

A share of the extensive Catholic lands fell to Sir William Cavendish . <P> At the beginning of World War II the family owned some 180,000 acres , Chatsworth House , Hardwick Hall , Bolton Abbey , Compton Place , Lismore Castle in Ireland and a town house in Carlton Gardens ( now a heap of blitzed rubble ) . The Cavendishes rank well up among the " twelve families that own England .
