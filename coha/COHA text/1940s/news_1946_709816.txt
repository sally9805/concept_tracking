txt The city 's industry limped back toward normal yesterday as three locals of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , AFL , reported that 4,715 truck drivers , or 41 per cent of those involved in the strike that started Sept. 1 , had gone back to work under contracts providing a wage increase of 31 cents an hour . Joseph M. Adelizzi , chairman of the joint committee representing the two principal associations of truck owners , conceded that a " dent " had been made in the wall of employer resistance to the union 's wage program , but insisted that not more than 25 per cent of the drivers had returned to their jobs . One thousand representatives of trucking companies , including virtually all the leaders of the industry , gave a rising vote of confidence to Mr. Adelizzi 's committee at a meeting last night at the Hotel Pennsylvania . They pledged themselves not to sign contracts with the union until they were " given an opportunity to settle on a basis which is reasonable and economically sound . " Their action was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was opposed to granting an increase of even 181/2 cents an hour . The food situation improved as two of the city 's largest wholesale grocers , Seeman Brothers and Francis H. Leggett &; Co. , broke away from the leadership of the associations and signed individual agreements . With the H. C. Bohack and Thomas Roulston ' food chain drivers already at work under similar contracts , union officials were confident that all food movements would be normal within a day or two This hope was strengthened by reports that the Safeway chain of 270 stores and R. C. Williams &; Co. , wholesale grocers , were prepared to sign with their drivers as soon as wage problems affecting warehouse and platform employes could be straightened out . However , the contract haulers for the 486 closed units of the Atlantic &; Pacific chain continued to hold out against the new contract , and there was no move to sign on the part of truckers for the National Biscuit Company , the Sunshine Biscuit Company , the National Sugar Refining Company or the American Can Company , which manufacturers fiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a week of editions in which advertising and many features had to be eliminated to conserve newsprint . Although the United States Trucking Company , which handles newsprint deliveries for several newspapers , did not sign a union contract , arrangements were made for the movement of newsprint to these papers in trucks operated by other companies that had accepted the union 's terms . Local 807 , whose members are employed in the transportation of newsprint , cooperated in the carrying out of these arrangements . The steady upswing throughout the day in the number of trucks moving food , medicine and newsprint made it apparent that the most oppressive effects of the seventeen-day tie-up had been overcome , but it was equally apparent that the city 's industry was not yet " out of the woods " so far as scheduling full operations and recalling laid-off employes was concerned . Rail Freight Embargo Remains None of the large trucking companies serving railroad terminals and piers had yet deserted the two associations , and the Association of American Railroads reiterated that the embargo on railroad freight shipments would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after some semblance of normal truck operations had been restored at terminals . Among the large operators still holding out were Scott Brothers , which makes pick-ups and deliveries for the Pennsylvania Railroad ; Sheridan &; Duncan , headed by Hugh E. Sheridan , impartial arbitrator for the local trucking industry , which performs a similar service for the New York Central ; United States Trucking , Motor Haulage , Gerosa , Pyramid and Brookhattan . Both John O'Rourke , secretarytreasurer of Local 282 , and John E. Strong , president of Local 807 , expressed certainty that if any one of these large employers signed up the force of competition would bring all the others into line almost immediately . Both unionl leaders indicated that they expected such a break soon . Little optimism was voiced , however , about the outlook for speedy capitulation on the part of the large over-the-road truck operators . Virtually all the 1,200 New York drivers employed on longdistance trucks are members of Local 807 . Mr. Strong said only seven operators with sixty drivers had signed thus far . Among the big holdouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and M &; M with sixty . 722 Operators Signed Up A recapitulation at 6 P. of the contracts signed by Locals 807 , 282 and 816 showed that 722 operators out of a combined total of 1570 , or 46 per cent , had signed up , leaving 848 whose trucks were still idle . According to the reports of the three unions , 6,760 drivers are still on strike , as against 11 , - 475 who were away from their jobs at 1:55 P. M. Tuesday when the members of Local 807 voted to begin signing individual contracts with employers willing to grant the 31-cent pay rise . A total of 456 contracts covering 2,925 drivers was ? signed the first day . Yesterday 266 more employers signed , permitting 1,790 more strikers to resume their jobs , according to the union score sheet . The tally became somewhat confused , however , as a result of new figures submitted by Mr. Strong on the number of Local 807 members who originally had been affected by the strike . Instead of 10,000 , the number previously used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were covered by the general trucking agreement . The others , he said , had stopped work temporarily in sympathy , with those who were on strike , but had begun returning to work last Wednesday when Daniel J. Tobin , president of the international union , instructed all members of New York and New Jersey locals whose contracts were still in effect to live up to them . As a result , according to Mr. Strong 's revised figures , the number of idle members of Local 807 had been cut to 6,000 when the union started to sign separate agreements with employers . Up to last night 489 operators out of 1,200 had signed and 2,877 members had gone back to work . This left 711 employers and 3,123 men still idle , Mr. Strong reported . Pressure Seen " Irresistible " He declared that the pressure of shippers on the trucking companies that had not signed would prove " so irresistible " that they would be compelled to break away from the two associations , the Motor Carrier Association and the State Motor Truck Association , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices of Local 282 by Mr. O'Rourke , who said there was " nothing left for the operators to do but sign up . " He reported that 158 operators with 1,338 drivers had entered into contracts , leaving ninety-two operators with 2,962 men still outside the fold . In addition to Seeman Bros. and Francis H. Leggett &; Co. , the list of Local 282 's signers included the drug concerrs of Eimer &; Amend and E. R. Squibb &; Sons . Mr. O'Rourke said five or six large lumber truckers also had signed . He predicted that Gristede Brothers would sign within the next twenty-four hours , although no definite word had yet been received from representatives of this food chain . He also forecast that R. C. Williams &; Co. would sign except for a minor dispute affecting classifications for members of another union representing platform employes . At the offices of Local 816 a spokesman for Martin T. Lacey , secretary-treasurer , said seventyfive of its 120 employers had signed and that 500 of its 1,175 striking members were back at work . Largest of the signers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpers and which operates a transfer service for the Railway Express Agency , in addition to its regular trucking business . Claims Called " Exaggerated " The joint committee representing the large employers described the union claims as " exaggerated , " but Mr. Adelizzi acknowledged that a " dent " had been made through the defection of a few concerns , like Seeman Bros. and Francis H. Leggett , from the association ranks . " It is like tree full of ripe apples , " he said . " When you shake it the rotten ones fall off . " He maintained that the large operators were standing firm and that those who signed were primarily owner-operators or companies that were not primarily engaged in the trucking industry but used trucking as an adjunct to their principal business . Speakers at the operators ' meet-I ing in the Hotel Pennsylvania said surveys by their auditors made it apparent that operators would have to " go out-of business " if they attempted to undertake the added wage costs entailed in the union 's demands . Their objections were not limited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more pay for forty hours ' work than the drivers formerly received for forty-four hours . They also protested against the elimination of the supplements written into the old contract during the war period . These permit operators to assign a driver to more than one truck a day and bar New York drivers from going beyond the Hackensack River in New Jersey . In furtherance of a plan disclosed by Mr. Adelizzi Tuesday , Harris J. Klein , an attorney , announced at the meeting that he would file an action at noon today in ? Federal Court asking for $10 , - 000,000 in damages from Local 807 on charges of violating the SmithConnally Act . He said the suit would be brought in the name of forty-four truck operators and that 450 other concerns would ask permission to join in the action within a few days . These operators will ask additional damages , according to Mr. Klein .
