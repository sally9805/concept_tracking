The question which secretly disturbs many a Christian mind was again openly voiced last week . The Bishop of Chichester , Dr. George K. A. Bell , speaking in Britain 's House of Lords , deplored the bombing of German cities . " I am not for getting the Luftwaffe 's tremendous bombing of Belgrade , Warsaw , Rotterdam , London , Portsmouth , Coventry , Canterbury and other places of military , industrial and cultural importance . But Hitler is a barbarian . There is no decent person on the Allied side who thinks we should make him our pattern or attempt to beat competitors at that market . " The Bishop feared that the R.A.F. bombings would bring Britain a " harvest of hate , " and impede postwar relations . And did the R.A.F. <P> intend to bomb Rome ? The deed , he warned , " would rankle in the memory of every good European as did Rome 's destruction by the Goths . " Lord Lang of Lambeth ( see p. 56 ) , 79-year-old retired Archbishop of Canterbury , seconded the Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exult and gloat " over the bombings of Germany . He feared that this attitude would result in " a lamentable lapse " in Britons ' outlook . <P> Said Lord Lang : " Recent attacks upon cities like Hamburg , Frankfort and Berlin seem to me to go a long way beyond what hitherto has been the declared policy of the Government and the Bomber Command . " Viscount Cranborne , Government lead er of the House of Lords , gave the prelates a firm reply . He denied that R.A.F. bombings were terror raids , told how last summer 's flights over Hamburg had cost the Germans 400,000,000 man-hours , insisted that industrial life ceases only when " the whole life of the cities in which they are situated is brought to a standstill . . . <P> making it quite impossible for workmen to carry on their work . " He said : " It is to me full justification for the present bombing campaign . I can not give the Bishop of Chichester any hope that we shall abate our bombing policy . On the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crushing effect until the final victory is assured . " At the present moment , he added , " It is not the Government 's intention to drop bombs on the precincts of Vatican City , nor , if it can be avoided , on the city of Rome . " Then a Roman Catholic peer , Viscount FitzAlan , added : " I have the greatest possible affection for the present holder of the high office of Pope and I should deprecate strongly any thing that might put him to any personal inconvenience . At the same time we can not be blind to the fact that whatever may happen to the existing holder of the Holy See we always get another , and that is not a thing to be ignored . . . .
