Around the village of Bazouges-du-Dsert , in Brittany , the apples grow big and sweet , and the Calvados ( apple brandy ) is a potable that is more in demand than the local water . In the town one morning last week the biggest bell in the church tower began to peal . It was a familiar but urgent tocsin of alarm . Government tax collectors had been sighted . The revenuers were looking for illegal Calvados and unlicensed stills . <P> At his headquarters in nearby Louvign , Lieut . Jean Leroux of the Gendarmerie Nationale got up from his desk and went to the roof . He was supposed to help the revenuers and he would have to discipline the tocsin-sounders , but there was no great rush . Leroux paid no attention as farmers barricaded their barn doors and pulled their little wagon-stills into the fields to be hidden under piles of hay . <P> Deeper Knowledge . " In a moment of such alarm , " said Leroux to his sergeant , " the experienced police officer allows himself the luxury of noticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . For instance , " and Leroux 's arm swung this way &; that , pointing , " the little men who are not the little husbands coming quickly from the little houses , and that blonde number from the bar hurrying from behind the hedge . But quick ! We have practically not a moment to lose . " <P> Lieut . Leroux and four other gendarmes drove to Bazouges , where Leroux and his sergeant climbed up the church bell tower . There they found a bicycle repairman and a carriagemaker smoking their pipes and swinging the clapper against the big bell . <P> " The meaning of this ? " snapped Leroux . <P> " It is a question of a telephone call , " said the bicycle man blandly . " I had thought we might need a lawyer and hoped that if someone heard the bell ringing he would call a lawyer for me . " <P> " No time for drolleries , " said Leroux . " You are under arrest . We must find the flying squad of the department of indirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the church courtyard , where some 200 glowering men of the district had gathered to defy the revenuers . The prisoners were put into one of the police cars , which cruised about until two harassed men in city clothes stepped from a doorway . " We had hardly begun asking around about alcohol , " said one of the revenuers , " when the bell sounded . " In the end the revenuers got nothing and the bell-ringing prisoners were freed , after a long and fatherly lecture from Lieut . Leroux . <P> Ordinary Liberty . Like many another village in France 's northern apple country , Bazouges felt that it had not yet been truly " liberated . " Before the war , the people could make as much tax-free Calvados as they wanted for local consumption . The Germans had decreed that each orchardist could distill only ten liters a year-hardly enough to wet the sale of a good heifer . The postliberation French government had not only failed to repeal the silly law , it had even tried to enforce it . <P> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell you . We farmers are difficult to separate from our money , especially by the government . That is true all over the world . Is it not ? Eh bien , what we want is just liberty , just plain ordinary liberty . "
