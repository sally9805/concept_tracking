The time for politeness was past . Republicans and Democrats in the Senate were playing for keeps . Last week , for the first time in 14 years , Republicans knew what it meant , as the party in power , to have to strain every muscle to win a decision in a no-quarter contest . With the aid of Texas ' " Pappy " O'Daniel they continued the special War Investigating Committee ( TIME , Jan. 27 ) . <P> Democrats feared that under Maine 's Owen Brewster , the revived committee would spend most of its time turning up campaign ammunition for 1948 . Publicly they charged that extension of the committee violated the spirit of the La Follette-Monroney reorganization act . But each house is the judge of its own rules , and the G.O.P. majority judged it no violation . Even so , the vote was too close for comfort : 47 to 45 . What hurt the Republican leadership most was that four of their own number-New Hampshire 's Tobey , Vermont 's Aiken , Oregon 's Morse and Kentucky 's John S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote was refreshingly forthright : " I thought it was the wrong thing to do . Though I believe in party organization and fidelity , I did n't think it was the overbearing consideration here . " <P> The Lowest Terms . Despite this narrow squeak , the Republican leadership marched straight up to an identical crisis two days later , forced establishment of another separate committee-Small Business-under the chairmanship of Nebraska 's rambunctious Kenneth Wherry . <P> " The real motive behind this , " shouted Maverick Tobey , " was to provide a committee chairmanship for the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Nebraska . That is reducing it to its lowest terms . " For Brewster , it was too low- " a level with which I do n't care to be associated . I do n't want to argue with a skunk . " <P> Men at Work . Between debate days , the Senate 's standing committees went ahead with their duties in obedience to the reorganization act . The Labor Committee , under Ohio 's Robert Taft , had a time schedule as neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take , said he , six weeks to consider the mass of labor legislation in its baskets . But the committee got off to a slow start . Labor Secretary Schwellenbach had a cold which kept him from appearing . Instead , the committee heard two of its own members whose views it knew well already : Montana 's pro-labor James E. Murray , who tried to delay legislation by having a commission probe labor relations first , and Minnesota 's Joe Ball , who argued for stern restrictions on labor for the nation 's welfare . <P> In another chamber the Public Works Committee was performing the traditional rite of examining the fitness of the President 's nominee for a high office : Gordon Rufus Clapp , 41 , as chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority . A quiet , earnest career man , with reams of TVA statistics on the tip of his tongue , Clapp would have had easy going but for the running grudge fight waged by aging , crotchety Kenneth McKellar against all TVA officers because they refuse to hire his political hacks . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to order by Chairman Chapman Revercomb . Clapp would be approved .
