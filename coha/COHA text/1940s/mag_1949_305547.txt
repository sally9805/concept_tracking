The Russian administrative setup experienced further quakes last weekend when the Supreme Soviet announced that the youngest member of the Politburo , Nikolai Voznesensky , 45 , had been released as chairman of the State Planning Commission ( head of the U.S.S.R. 's industrial production ) . This had occurred on the same day that Molotov and Mikoyan were released of their ministries . But there was a difference : Molotov and Mikoyan remained as Deputy Prime Ministers ; Voznesensky did not . <P> Voznesensky was a protg of the late Andrei Zhdanov . His removal may be explained by the death of his patron , or by charges made before the Supreme Soviet last week that Russian industry was producing things easy to make rather than the things needed by the people . <P> Into Voznesensky 's job as chief planner went his assistant , Maxim Zakharovich Saburov , who had been hauled up from obscurity two years ago , appointed a Deputy Prime Minister . At the same time Ivan T. Golyakov was relieved of his duties as President of the Supreme Court of the U.S.S.R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
