" This has n't happened since 1886 . " <P> Cotton-haired , devout , 81-year-old Amos Alonzo Stagg was being carried off the field last week on the shoulders of his football team . His College of the Pacific team had just toppled a collection of All-Americas and professionals from Del Monte Pre-Flight , 16-to-7 , in one of the season 's biggest upsets . Not since Alonzo Stagg pitched Yale 's baseball team to a 6-to-5 victory over Harvard 57 years ago had he beamed so broadly . His College of the Pacific looked like the strongest on the Pacific Coast , perhaps his best team since University of Chicago ruled the Big Ten Conference in 1924 . <P> Before the game Del Monte was a 5-to-1 favorite to win . Unbeaten in four starts , it was rated the strongest service eleven in the U.S. The backfield alone was good enough for any professional team : " Passing Paul " Christman of Missouri , Fordham 's Len Eshmont , Ohio State 's Jim McDonald , Parker Hall of Mississippi and the Cleveland Rams . Right end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left end was another All-America , Bowden Wyatt of Mississippi . <P> But Stagg 's Tigers-Navy trainees who had played some football themselves-outfought and outtricked Del Monte for Stagg 's greatest victory in 54 years of coaching . <P> The Start . Lonny Stagg 's football began at Yale , where he was end on Walter Camp 's first All-America in 1889 . <P> He was also one of the best pitchers in the U.S. and while at Yale he had offers from six big-league teams . But his ambition lay in the ministry and he concentrated on Bible under William Rainey Harper . When Harper became president of brand-new University of Chicago , he offered Lonny Stagg $1,500 to head the athletic department . <P> Stagg was speechless at the figure . <P> " I 'll give you $2,000 and an assistant professorship . " Stagg still could not answer . <P> The ante jumped to $2,500 and an associate professorship , a lifetime job . Stagg managed to accept before the terms went any higher . <P> In 41 years at Chicago , Stagg won 273 games , lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter Eckersall , Fritz Crisler and Hugo Bezdek . Stagg used the first tackling dummy ( an old mattress ) , originated the end-around play , the tackle back shift , was the first to use the hidden-ball principle . He developed the shift , which later became the mainspring of the Rockne system , and Rockne credited his offense to Stagg . <P> It 's Just a Game . By 1933 Stagg was 70 and up for mandatory retirement . Double A Stagg was football 's Grand Old Man . Only Connie Mack , 80-year-old manager of the Philadelphia Athletics , compared with him then ( as he does now ) in disregard of age . Both hate liquor and tobacco . Both have infinite faith in their players . Both recognize that baseball and football are only games-something few coaches admit-and refuse to flail their breasts or their players when they hit a losing streak . <P> At 71 , Stagg had still not had his fill of football . He took his second lifetime job , coaching at Pacific . As at Chicago , his wife was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he won less than half his games . Pacific sometimes grumbled that the Old Man was aging and should gracefully retire . But Stagg stubbornly continued to teach his boys to play for fun. *
